Having read in the earliest portion of my life the small part of Mr. Hals' Parochial History pub lished about the year 1750, 1 entertained from that time a strong desire for seeing the remainder also in print ; this desire grew up with my years, in creased perhaps by an understanding that the manuscript had disappeared, no one seemed to know in what way, and that it might possibly have been destroyed. At last, the manuscript was recovered by the most justly celebrated Mr. Whitaker, from a book seller at Exeter, who had retained the papers as a pledge for some debt; from Mr. Whitaker they have come to his son-in-law Richard Taunton, Esq. M.D. who has with great liberality placed them in my hands; mutilated, however, as to the histories of several parishes, from want of care and of attention on the part of the individual holding them as a deposit, although he must have deemed them to be of pecuniary value. Mr. Tonkin's papers were preserved by his niece Miss Fosse, who died more than fifty years ago, at a place that may now be termed, without of fence, the village of Michell. This lady must have been the last of Mr. Tonkin's near relations ; for, although the property left at her decease could <t"], [14, "PREFACE. II not have amounted to anything of importance, the funeral was attended by many scores of per sons, claiming shares of whatever could be found. Under such circumstances every moveable was soon converted into money, and the manuscript of the Parochial History, complete as Mr. Tonkin left it, got into the possession of Lord Dunstan ville, by whom it was instantly offered to me, on my preparing to edit the Parochial History of Mr. Hals. And as Mr. Tonkin copied largely from Mr. Hals, many of the lost parishes are at least partially supplied. The late Mr. Lysons got possession of a beauti fully transcribed copy of the whole that remains of Mr. Hals' Parochial History; this was purchased at the sale of his books by the Earl of Aylesford, who without any personal acquaintance whatever, has had the liberality to allow me the use of this splendid folio volume, during the whole time of my work passing through the press. Mr. Gregor has supplied me with an original copy of the last Heraldic Visitation of Cornwall ; and to Doctor Boase I am indebted for a geological description of every parish. Previously to my taking this task on myself, I endeavoured to preserve the works of Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin for the public, by the more easy expedient of advancing money in aid of the pub lication ; but not having obtained success, I at last adventured on what is now done, little aware, however, ofthe pains, and time, required for editing the histories of more than two hundred parishes ;"], [15, "PREFACE. III although I have to a considerable extent relieved myself from the most irksome duty of correcting the press, by obtaining the assistance of Messrs. Nichols and Son, on the condition of their taking what is very unlikely to accrue, any profit arising from the publication, and my sustaining, the more probable alternative, all the loss. Mr. Hals' work is given without alteration, except considerable omissions of long histories, from the Bollandists and other writers of legends, relative to obscure Saints, httle known, or deserv ing of being known ; and in many cases owing their supposed connection with Cornwall, entirely to the writer's imagination ; and in the opposite extreme, of the lives of personages most worthy of being preserved and studied in general history, of Apostles, of Emperors of Rome, and Kings, but quite as irrelevant as the former, to a History of Cornwall. I have been also unable to retain the greater part of the derivations assigned to the names of manors, families, or places ; they are generally re ferred to some word of a similar sound in modern English, after a manner scarcely less ludicrous than the mock etymologies of Dr. Swift. Lastly, I have omitted various anecdotes, con taining simple scandal, without any thing illustra tive of the age or country. Other anecdotes of a public nature are retained; on a conviction that events long passed by, and incapable from their very nature of being sup pressed, neither will, nor ought to excite any un- a 2"], [16, "IV PREFACE. pleasing feeling in the minds of those who may be directly or collaterally descended from the persons to whom they relate. I have not throughout the whole work inten tionally used a single expression disrespectful to any one, nor have I retained from either of the manuscripts, nor added of my own one new anec dote or tale capable by possibility of giving the least pain. If an expression should be found, which in the opinion of any individual is at variance with these assertinos, I beg permission to apologize before I am accused, and to declare that the fault has been involuntary, and that I am not aware, at this instant, of any such fault existing. Mr. Tonkin has mainly copied from Mr. Hals, and these portions of course have not been printed over again ; but all his additions are pre served, with the greater part of his derivations, apparently much more accurate than those they are intended to confute. Here it would have been wise, certainly it would have been prudent, for me to have concluded the work ; but having acquired, through the course of a long life, the knowledge of many incidents, which, although of little general importance, may amuse persons taking an interest even in trifles connected with their immediate neighbourhoods, I have been induced to add under each parish, such matters as happened to occur to my re collection ; using also in many cases the informa tion drawn by Mr. Lysons from sources accessible"], [17, "PREFACE. V only to himself, in consequence of his situation in the Tower. I have further had recourse to the works treat ing on monasteries and religious establishments ; but without considering myself bound or pledged to make out a complete history in any case, either by researches into documents not in my possession, or, still less, (at my time of life and distant resi dence) by investigations on the spot. This part of the work will be found very un equally executed ; but it was never intended to be otherwise. At the end of each parish I have added the common statistics : \u2014 the number of acres from the measurement of Mr. Hitchins ; the value of the real property ; the account of poor rate, and of the population at the four periods of numeration, from the Parliamentary Returns. And through the great kindness and hberality of Doctor Boase, I have been enabled to subjoin to these the geo- logy of each parish, deduced from an actual survey in person of the whole county, by that very intelli gent and experienced geologist, chemist, and phy siologist. And here it may be right to observe, that, as the formations are not merely similar, but identi cal, over many contiguous parishes, and again in parishes disjoined from each other, the plan of re ferring from one to another became indispensable, to avoid repetition after repetition, and adding, without any utility, to the size of the work. In the form of Appendices will be found several"], [18, "VI PREFACE. matters relative to Cornwall, either not previously in print, or that cannot be obtained separately from large works, of which they form a part. Mr. Scawen's Works, so far as they are con tained in the Bodleian Library. Leland's Itinerary. Drayton's Polyolbion. The Transcript of a Manuscript from the British Museum ; proving, I believe, that even Mr. Whita ker, one without doubt among our most able and learned antiquaries, may be mistaken on a subject connected with the objects of his peculiar research. There will be also some miscellaneous matters, and among them an Index to Mr. Carew's History ; an addition greatly demanded also by another work, which would then become the most useful Corpus Historicum relating to our county. There are several other manuscripts of Mr. Tonkin, chiefly copies from Mr. Hals of pedigrees, &c. but these I have not touched. And I have purposely abstained from every general topic re lating to the county at large, as these have been amply discussed by our various historians. The first in order of time, the most interesting and most entertaining, is Mr. Carew. This work was first published in 1602, a second edition came out in 1723, and a third, chiefly through the exertions of the late Mr. John Price of Penzance, in 1 769. But the edition far exceeding all the others, with highly valuable additions, and with copious notes, was given to the public in 181 1 by the late Lord Dunstanville, in one vol. 4to,"], [19, "PREFACE. VII 457 pages, with an excellent engraving of the author, from a picture at Anthony. Mr. Richard Carew was of a very ancient and respectable family ; he inherited Anthony from a long line of ancestors, and has transmitted it to his descendants. Wood says, in the Athen\u00e6 Oxonienses, that he was born in the year 1555, became a gentleman commoner of Christ Church at a very early age, but had his chambers in Bradgate HaU (since Pembroke College), and that at fourteen he dis puted, extempore, with Sir Philip Sidney, in tbe presence of several distinguished visitants to the university. After three years' residence at Oxford, Mr. Ca rew removed to the Middle Temple, where he passed three years more, and then went with his uncle on an embassy to Poland. In the year 1577 Mr. Carew married Juliana Arundell, of Trerice, and served the office of Sheriff in 1586. It is recorded that he was inti mate with most of the noted scholars of those times, and especially with Sir Henry Spelman. He died in November 1620, and is buried in his parish church of Anthony, (see the epitaph, p. xxiv). Mr. Carew's life is given in considerable detail as an introduction to his History of Cornwall. He wrote and translated several other works ; but they seem not to have survived. Soon after Mr. Carew's History, Mr. John Nor den's was composed, with the title of \" Speculi Britanni\u00e6 Pars. A Topographical and Historical"], [20, "PREFACE. VIII Description of Cornwall, by the Perambulation, View, and Delineation of John Norden.\" This work has been well characterized by Mr. Tonkin, as \" a mean performance, full of egre gious mistakes, with most defective and erroneous maps of every hundred, yet containing several things in it not to be met with elsewhere.\" Our next historian, but after a considerable in terval of time, was Mr. William Scawen, a frag ment only of whose work is known to be extant, and which will appear in these volumes. He was of an ancient family, well educated, and possessed of an ample fortune. He represented St. German's in Parliament, and received the ap pointment of Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, im mediately after the Restoration of King Charles the Second. Of Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin I have not any better information than what is given by Mr. Ly sons. He says : \"About the year 1685, Mr. William Hals, a gentleman of an ancient Devonshire family, which had been some time settled at Fentongollan, in St. Michael-Penkevill, began to make collections for a parochial history of Cornwall, which he continued for at least half a century ; it was brought down by him to about the year 1736. Mr. Hals died in 1 739 ; his parochial history being at that time nearly completed. About the year 1750, the pub lication of this work was undertaken by Mr. Andrew Brice, then a printer at Truro, who afterwards re moved to Exeter, where he published an useful geo-"], [21, "PREFACE. IX graphical dictionary and other books. The account of seventy-two parishes arranged alphabetically, from Advent to Helston inclusive, was printed in folio in ten numbers, which are extremely scarce. The publication is said to have been suspended for want of purchasers ; occasioned by the scurrilous anecdotes it contained, and reflections thrown on some of the principal families. It is probable, how ever, that the inaccuracies with which it abounds, and the tedious legends of saints to whom the churches are dedicated, which occupy at least half the work, would have operated more to the preju dice of its sale than the scandalous anecdotes which occasionally occur, many of which had been omitted by the editor. The most valuable part of the work is the account of families and the de scent of property ; but in these he is frequently inaccurate; and, as Dr. Borlase observes, 'what he says should not have too great stress laid upon it, when it stands upon his single authority.' \" Contemporary with Hals, as a coUector of materials for a parochial history of Cornwall, was Thomas Tonkin, Esq. of Trevaunance, some time member for Helston, a gentleman of an ancient family, who had made great progress in preparing such a history for the press, and had completed several parishes. Mr. Tonkin began to write his parochial history in 1702, at which time he had the use of Hals's collections. Dr. Borlase seems to have supposed that Hals's collections were brought down from 1702 to 1736 by Tonkin ; the truth is, that they both brought down their collec-"], [22, "X PREFACE. tions to that period, without any communication with each other, which seems to have ceased soon after the first period above-mentioned. Mr. Ton- kin himself says, speaking of Hals in the year 1739, ' it is between twenty-five and thirty years since I have seen any of his collections, and, I be- lieve, at least twenty since I have seen him. I am told that he has greatly improved and polished them since that time ; but as his method is quite different from mine, and that I have some other reasons not necessary to be mentioned for not cor- responding with him, I can safely say, that in this present work of mine, I have not made use of one single line out of his compositions.' Mr. Tonkin, in one of his MSS. dated March 27th, 1733, desires that, ' if by death, or any other accident, his MSS. should fall into other hands, they would by no means publish them in the dress in which they then appeared, but be pleased to new-model them after the method followed in those few which had received his last corrections, such as at St. Agnes, St. Piran in the Sands, St. Michael-Penkevil,' &c. In 1 737 he had made sufficient progress in his col lections to enable him to put forth proposals, in which he announced the plan of his publication. \" In the year 1739, Mr. Tonkin had completed his MS. of the first part of his work, which was to treat of the county of Cornwall in general ; his epistle dedicatory of that date is printed at the beginning of Lord de Dunstanville's edition of Ca rew, addressed to Sir William Carew, Bart, and Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart, then representatives in"], [23, "PREFACE. XI Parliament for the county of Cornwall. In this letter he recapitulates what had been done towards the topography of his native county. Besides the works of Leland, Camden, Norden, and Carew, he mentions the general collections of Hals and An stis, and those of Pearce and Gwavas on the Stan naries, the Cornish language, &c. Towards the conclusion of his epistle, he says, ' I wish I could say that many more of my countrymen had as sisted me with their kind endeavours. I do not yet despair of having several ; for which reasons I have, in my proposals, enlarged the designed time of the publication of this part. I hope they will be so good as to send in contributions. If they persist in their refusal, they must be contented with such coarse fare as I am able to give them, which I will endeavour to make as palatable for them as I can ; perhaps, when they come to taste of this, they may be prevailed on to supply me with something better towards the two remaining parts. All that I can promise them is, that I will give them the best account I can, without the least par tiality ; neither shall any one person have a just occasion given him to charge me with any wilful omission or sophisticated truth.\" Very little was done by Mr. Tonkin to the pa rochial department of his intended history after the date of this letter; he died in 1742, and in the latter part of his life, being unhappily involved in pecuniary difficulties, he grew less attentive to study, and died without printing any part of his intended history."], [24, "PREFACE. XII Doctor William Borlase more than meditated a parochial history, having made some collections towards it. If this design had been carried into execution, all further attempts might have been deemed superfluous. His Antiquities and Natural History of Corn wall gave ample proof of the ability, the ingenuity, and of the diligence possessed by this excellent man, who had the deserved good fortune of being equally esteemed and admired, not by the neigh bourhood alone, but by the most learned and sci entific persons throughout Europe. The Antiquities were first published in 1754. The second edition in 1769. The Natural History in 1758. All in quarto. Respecting the Natural History, it may be ex pedient to remind the reader, that in the last edi tion of Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia, four volumes of the largest size, with one volume of plates, printed in 1783, the very word Geology does not occur; and that some years later, chemical lectures were publicly given on the phlogistic theory of Becher and Stahl. Mr. Polw^hele has published in seven parts, be ginning with the date 1 803, and ending with that of 1816, making in all two quarto volumes, of about 1200 pages, in small type, and abounding with notes and extracts in a type still smaller, an immense collection of matter relative to the anti quities, the biography, the literature, the history military and civil, &c. of Cornwall ; arranged under distinct heads, and enriched with prints of distin guished persons, with figures of ancient castles,"], [25, "PREFACE. XIII churches, monuments, &c. and with views of towns, and of romantic scenery. One is astonished at the great labour bestowed on this work, and still more so when it is recollected, that the author has distinguished himself in every branch of elegant literature, and most of all in that department, where the fire of genius is believed somewhat to diminish the aptitude for patient toil. The next work on Cornwall deserves particular attention on various grounds, \u2014 its extensive plan, arrangement, and parochial history, and the situa tion in life of its author, Mr. C. S. Gilbert, who at the time of his executing \" An Historical Survey of the County of Cornwall ; to which is added a com plete Heraldry of the same, with numerous en gravings,\" resided as a druggist in Plymouth or Devonport ; and he is said to have acquired a knowledge of this trade by accompanying one of those itinerant doctors in medicine, who are in the habit of attracting customers by exhibitions little suited to the gravity of a profound science. Mr. Gilbert is understood to have collected in formation which induced him to believe, that he might claim a descent from the Gilberts of Comp ton Castle ; and under that persuasion he applied himself to the study of antiquities, with genealogy, heraldry, and every collateral science, which led him by degrees to undertake the History of Corn wall, and to complete it in two quarto volumes, usually bound in three ; all which he executed with such eagerness, zeal, and disregard of ex pense, as to involve him during the latter part of"], [26, "PREFACE. XIV his life in considerable difficulties. For Compton Castle, and the family from which this gentleman thought himself derived, and which is now repre sented by the Reverend J. Pomeroy Gilbert, of Bodmin, see Prince's Worthies of Devon, p. 420, edition of 1810. About the same time that Mr. C. S. Gilbert's work appeared, another very similar to it came out sanctioned by the names of Mr. Samuel Drew of St. Austell, well known by his profound metaphy sical writings, and of Mr. Malachy Hitchins, son of the celebrated astronomer, who, residing at St. Hilary, three hundred miles from London, con ducted the Nautical Almanack from the second year of its appearance 1768, to the conclusion of his life in 1 809, during a period of more than forty years. A well written and perspicuous life of Mr. Drew, has been given to the public by his son Mr. Jacob Halls Drew, in which many interesting particulars are given of this distinguished writer ; together with a fair and impartial account of his various works, of which the most known, and perhaps the best, is his Essay on the Human Soul. This treatise, pub lished in 1802, contains every argument that can be found in the Ph\u00e6don of Plato, with additions; and the whole is not inferior to its prototype. But the observation of an ancient peripatetic philoso pher, Alexander of Appodisia, a city of Caria in Lesser Asia, is equally applicable to both : AXX' eon.

Mr. Hitchins gave several proofs of genius ; but his life was cut short at an early period. Various descriptions and accounts of local dis tricts, and of particular places in Cornwall may be found ; of these I shall mention three as by far the best, and highly deserving of attention.

Since it has pleased Almighty God so to consti tute the world, that the human race should every where increase up to the very limit of subsistence, all countries must witness by far the greater por tion of their inhabitants exposed to the dangers of privation, of poverty, and of distress, incapable of be ing mitigated in any way, except by the prudence, the care, and the general good conduct ofthe parties themselves ; but easily and fatally susceptible of being augmented, almost to an unlimited degree, by the establishment of permanent charities, by distributions in the shape of largesses, and above all, by the greatest and most melancholy achievement of human weakness and short-sighted folly, the English system of poor laws, extending premiums to idleness and improvidence, on a basis of inde finite rehef to claimants multiplying without end. \" My lot might have been thrown among these ; it might have been that of a savage, or a slave : nor can I reflect without grati tude on the bounty of Nature, which has cast my birth in a free and civilized country, in a family decently endowed with the gifts of For tune, in an age of science and of philosophy, where years outrun in discoveries and in improve ments the advances of former centuries.\" It is not for me to determine how far these ad vantages have been improved by myself; but at the age of threescore years and ten, I may justly say with the other writer alluded to\u2014"], [29, "17 PREFACE. \" The retrospect of life recalls to my view many opportunities of good neglected, much time squan dered upon trifles, and more lost in idleness and vacancy. I leave many great designs unattempted, and many great attempts unfinished ; but, my mind being free from the burden of any heavy crime, I compose myself to tranquillity : I endeavour to abstract my thoughts from hopes and cares, which, though reason knows them to be vain, still try to keep their old possession of my heart : I humbly expect the hour which Nature cannot long delay ; and with the most profound adoration of the Divinity, I hope to possess in a better state of existence, that happiness which here I could not find, and that virtue which here I have been unable to attain.\" Davies Gilbert, 1837.

In almost every passage of any length, Mr. Whitaker's additions are marked with a [W.] Geology having pressed forward during the present century, at a pace unexampled in other sciences, may reasonably be expected to reach new discoveries in comparatively short intervals of time ; these have been reduced, however, almost to instants in respect to Cornwall. After the very able, minute, and laborious investigation made by Doctor Boase, of every district, of every parish in the whole county, the work of discovery would seem to have been completed, at the least for seve ral years ; but Mr. de la Beche came soon after wards into Cornwall, under the sanction of Go vernment, assisted by officers of the Engineers employed on the great Trigonometrical Survey ; and this eminent Geologist has, in consequence, been enabled to lay down the various main lodes, the cross courses, the elvans, &c. together with the junctions of granite, greenstone, and killas, with an accuracy and discrimination never before at tained, nor ever approximated to, except by Mr. Richard Thomas, in his survey of the mining dis trict, made about twenty years ago. Mr. De la Beche has also been enabled to deduce several general laws observed in the direction of cleavages, in the dip of strata, in the heaves and slides of lodes, all of which will be detailed in an eagerly expected volume, together with a discovery"], [32, "20 PREFACE. most unexpected. The saxa metallifera of Corn wall had always been supposed referable to a very remote period of geological epochs, far anterior to the age of organic remains ; till this opinion became shaken by the discovery of shells, or of their impressions, in the hard schist rocks near Tintagell : others were subsequently found more to the south and west ; till at last Mr. De la Beche has detected the remains of organized life adjacent to a productive Copper Lode. Two other eminent geologists, whom it would be equally idle and presumptuous for me to praise, have established the fact of a formation in the northern parts of Cornwall and Devon, not less unexpected than the discovery just noticed. Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison having investigated the deep-seated rocks in Wales, and in the adjacent districts, have finally traced the carboniferous series under the Severn, and so far west as the level ridge of land, extending from near Launceston to the sea coast between St. Gennys and Botreaux Castle, along which plane the escarpment manifests itself in a very conspicu ous manner. While these discoveries may be considered as in progress, a Cornish gentleman, but one whose genius does honour to the nation, Mr. Robert Weare Fox, has deduced from galvanic action on metals, on their oxides, on their sulphurets, and on their saline solutions in water, the only theory that has yet accounted for the various phenomena observed in metallic lodes; and extending still further his investigations to the recently discovered connection"], [33, "21 PREFACE. between electric energies and terrestrial magnet ism, Mr. Fox has been enabled to give more than probable reasons for the extraordinary fact of some metals usually selecting, in all parts of the world, lodes or fissures running nearly east and west, and why other metals prefer rents at right angles to the former ; and in respect to the fissures themselves, Mr. Fox has remarked appearances inducing him to believe that lodes of considerable breadth have not been formed by any one great and sudden rending of the earth ; but that, in a manner similar to the rising or to the sinking of land, by the gra dual action of causes now well known to exist, those clefts have been enlarged from time to time, and have as frequently received additional deposits, easily discriminated from each other. Mr. Fox appears also to have settled beyond the possibility of doubt, the long-agitated question respecting the temperature of mines, by establish ing a general relation between increases of heat and depth ; although the ratio cannot be reduced to any definite formula, being liable to vary with the presence of more or less water, and with the different conducting power of rocks, since mines in granite and in killas differ by several degrees of heat at the same level : yet the increase corresponds so generally with greater descents into the earth, that elevation of temperature, and not the expense, nor the difficulty of exhausting water, appears likely to oppose the final limit to the progress of mines in depth. In continuation of the same trains of reasoning"], [34, "22 PREFACE. and of thought, Mr. Fox has been led to investigate the important elements of variation and dip of the magnetic needle ; and in pursuing these inquiries, he has invented an instrument possessed of far greater accuracy than any one previously employed, and which at this moment is in actual use, through the enlightened liberality of our own and other governments, in various and distant portions of the globe. Mr. Henwood is about to lay before the Public a Work containing the results of more extensive and scientific researches into the nature of Lodes and Fissures, than have perhaps been ever executed by any individual. Mr. Henwood is well known to geologists : I shall therefore only add what I think myself bound in duty to notice, that an original appointment in the Stanneries, and a subsequent promotion, have been bestowed on Mr. Henwood, through the medium of Her Majesty's Duchy Offi cers, and principally of Sir George Harrison, in consideration of his scientific attainments, and of his desire to render these attainments available to the development of further inductions. I have endeavoured to render the work cheap by adopting the octavo form, and by abstaining from all decoration, except a slight sketch of the Pitt Diamond, which by raising that family into an influential situation, has modified the fate of Eu rope in a degree impossible to have been contem-"], [35, "23 PREFACE. plated by the Regent Duke of Orleans, when he purchased that bauble at the expense of an hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds ; and excepting also the Tomb of Archbishop Tregury, a view of Cotehele house, and the Seal of a Cor poration, all of which had been previously cut on wood. I have abstained from further expense with the view of placing my work in the hands of as many persons in Cornwall as I possibly could, thereby diffusing the entertainment likely to arise from Local Anecdotes, from Provincial Occurrences, and from Historical Events, not of sufficient gene ral importance for securing to themselves a place in national records.

Davies Gilbert, 1837-"], [36, ""], [37, "AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GEOLOGY OF CORNWALL By Dr. BOASE The geological notices inserted in this Work, are necessarily so brief and so unconnected, on account of the alphabetical arrangement of the parishes, that it is desirable that a few introduc tory remarks should be made that this defect may be in some measure obviated. Cornwall does not possess a great variety of rock formations, being composed of primary and tran- sition or intermediate groups, covered here and there with deposits of gravel, sand, and clay, which belong to the modern epoch. But this limited range of formations is more than compen- sated for by the great facilities which the geolo- gist here enjoys in his investigations ; the very extended line of cliffs which deeply indent the Cornish shores proffer numerous and instructive sections ; and the vast mining operations have brought to light most important phenomena. In- deed, no country of equal extent can, in these com bined advantages, be compared with Cornwall. On a general view of this country, the surface exhibits two systems of valleys ; one running paral- h 2"], [38, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION XXVI lei with the central ridge, which is highest near Launceston, and gradually, but irregularly, de clines till it terminates at the Land's End, in cliffs about a hundred feet in height ; the other inter secting the longitudinal valleys at right angles ; and as all the intermediate hills are more or less rounded, the country has an undulating appear ance in both directions, not unaptly compared to the waves of the sea. Through these two systems of valleys, the rivers flow, seeking outlets into the sea by the nearest continuous descent ; sometimes they effect this along the longitudinal, at others through the transverse valleys, receiving tributary streams on either hand from 'the lateral valleys, or curved hollows which they intersect. But sometimes the river is diverted in its course more than once, in consequence of the concavity of a cross curve rising above its level \u2014 or by that of the other system descending below this point \u2014 by which irregularity the stream is compelled to flow along the more favourable drainage; thus the Camel rises about four miles from the sea, in the moors near Davidstow, and flows more than twenty five before it empties itself into the sea at Padstow. In the hollows of these valleys the drainage is often sufficiently obstructed to produce marshy ground ; but seldom of such extent as to deserve the name of a lake. As regards the soil, on the high grounds it is frequently very shallow and barren ; but in the val leys it is very productive, and here and there is well wooded, more particularly on the southern coast. On the northern coast, in the vicinity of the sea,"], [39, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. XXVII it is very sandy, owing to the light testaceous sand of the shore being carried inland by high winds ; in this manner no inconsiderable tracts of fertile land have been devastated. Let us now turn our attention to the internal or geological structure of Cornwall. The highest parts of the central ridge, already alluded to, are composed of granite, which occurs in the form of four large insulated patches, so disposed at nearly equal distances from each other as to resemble a chain of islands extending from Launceston to the Land's End, that is in the direction of N.E. and S.W. On the same ridge, but rather parallel than continuous thereto, is the great granitic group of Dartmoor in Devon, the whole of which is some times called the Ocrynian Range. The granitic patch of Dartmoor is by far the most extensive, being nearly twenty miles in dia- meter ; that of Launceston is ten miles in length by six or seven in breadth at its widest part ; and its most elevated hills, Rough-tor and Brown-Willy, do not much exceed 1,300 feet in height. The granitic rocks of this patch, hke that of Dartmoor, are not much exposed by artificial excavations, so that their varieties cannot be easily examined; the weathered blocks, which on the summit and sides of the hills form tors and detached masses, consist of the hard or siliceous varieties of the common and fine-grained granites, such as have withstood the action of the elements. One of the most curious of these tors is the Cheese Wring* near Liskeard, a pile of single blocks, each being larger than the one immediately beneath. Pro-"], [40, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. XXVIII ceeding along the ridge towards the Land's End, the next, or St. Austel patch of granite will be found, much less than the last, but more interest ing both in a scientific and a commercial point of view. In addition to the kinds of granite already noticed, it contains beds of talcose granite, or protogine, which by its decomposition furnishes that valuable substance china clay ox kaolin, many thousand tons of which are annually exported for the potteries. The third, or Redruth patch of gra nite, affords many varieties of this rock, and has been well explored by numerous mines which have been productive in both tin and copper ores, affording also to the mineralogist a great variety of rare specimens. But the fourth, or Land's End granite, is by far the most important to the geolo gist, for the land becoming here very narrow, the sea has produced cliff-sections, both in the granite, and also at its point of junction with the slate, ex hibiting many interesting phenomena. Among these, the veins of granite in the slate are beauti fully displayed, and have long been a, great attrac tion to geologists ; but the modes in which these rocks meet aud unite, are not less deserving of notice. But for a detailed description of these curious facts, the reader may be referred to my \" Treatise on Primary Geology.\" Besides these four principal patches of granite, there are four others : 1st. that of Kitt Hill, near Callington ; 2nd. that of Tregonning and Godol phin, near Helston ; 3d. that of Cligga Point, near St. Agnes ; and lastly, that of the celebrated St. Michael's Mount. The two first are of some size,"], [41, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. XXIX and at the surface are both subdivided near the middle, by the overlapping of the slate : the other two are small, but very interesting to the geolo gist. It is worthy of remark that the fertility of these granitic groups gradually increases as they dimi nish in elevation ; and it is a curious but not sur prising coincidence, that the number of parish churches thereon follows the same order : \u2014 thus on the eastern and most extensive tract of granite, near Launceston, there is only one church ; on the next there are three ; on the Redruth patch six ; and on the Land's End granite no less than nine, within a space considerably less than that of the eastern tract. Each of these insulated groups of granite is sur rounded by schistose rocks, the layers of which, on all sides, inchne from the granite at various angles, from 20\u00b0 to 40\u00b0. Although these groups are thus separated from each other by the slate at the surface, yet it is the general opinion that they gradually approach beneath, until they are all united into one and the same mass \u2014 the inter mediate hollow spaces (the valleys, as it were, be tween the granitic mountains) being occupied by the slate. It mightj however, be maintained that the granite is imbedded in the slate, in large rounded masses, which would also account for the former rock underlying the other, within the limits of mining operations : and such an opinion would derive some support from the fact, that small insulated masses of granite in the slate are not of unfrequent occurrence."], [42, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. XXX The slate formation consists of two very distinct groups, when the most characteristic rocks are alone regarded ; but it is not easy to trace the boundary between them, as the contiguous rocks appear to pass gradually into each other. These groups have one character in common : viz. that they consist of several distinct kinds of rocks, each genus of which respectively may be subdivided into schistose and compact rocks ; the latter are imbedded in the former \u2014 are more crystalline \u2014 and often contain clusters of their constituent minerals : so that the complicated composition of these rocks is made known by Nature's own analysis. The group next the granite is primary, the more remote one is transition, or as they are termed in the following pages the porphyritic and calcareous series of the slate formation. The series next^taiL, granite is characterised by its beds of porpl^r and by its abounding in veins of tin and copper ores ; the other series by the frequent occurrence of calcareous spar and strata of limestone, with occasional organic remains, and by its being spar ingly metalliferous, containing no tin-ore, but being productive of lead and antimony. It is within the last series that the magnesian or ser pentine rocks occur, and which in the Lizard dis trict are developed to a large extent, forming one of the most interesting geological features of Cornwall. Those who are desirous of more in formation concerning this slate formation, will find a copious account in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the Geological Society of Corn-"], [43, "GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. XXXI wall. It is there proposed to give these rocks, whenever they possess well-marked characters, distinct names, and not to refer a great variety of rocks to the vague and indefinite genera of clay slate and greywacke\\ An accurate and more ex tended nomenclature would have rendered the fol lowing notices much more intelligible. In describing the general features of Cornwall, we must not omit to mention the metalliferous veins \u2014 the great source of its commercial pros perity \u2014 and the channel through which much cu rious information has been obtained, concerning the structure of the earth. These veins traverse indifferently both the granite and the slate, but are most abundant in the latter rock, in the vici nity of the granite. The general direction of the tin and copper veins (or lodes, as they are provin cially called) is nearly E.N.E. and W.S.W., and they are crossed by another system of veins, nearly at right angles, which are not commonly metal liferous, and when they do contain ores these are often of lead, antimony, silver, and other metals. This is not however a general rule, for in the pa rish of St. Just, Penwith, the tin and copper ores occur in the cross veins. The course of the veins is not straight, but they are always more or less un dulating, both in their direction and in their dip or underlie. Various interesting phenomena result from their meeting with and intersecting each other, known to the miner under the names of heaves, throws, and slides. This subject is replete with curious facts, but would require considerable space for their enumeration ; the reader must"], [44, "XXXII GEOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION. therefore be again referred to the work already alluded to on \" Primary Geology A Before concluding this brief sketch, a few words must be said on the beds of clay, sand, and gravel which cover the low grounds, both on the granite and on the slate. . These may he resolved into two kinds : 1st. those resulting from the decomposition of the rocks, and which are in their original posi tion ; and 2d. those which are not in situ, afford ing by their appearance, composition, and position, evidence of their having been transported. These deposits belong to three distinct periods, and al ternate with terrestrial and marine remains, ac cording to their situation in respect to the sea level at their respective epochs. Each of these transports was accompanied, or followed by, a change in the sea-level : the last corresponds with that now existing ; the previous one, by the ele vated ancient beaches, indicates that the sea was about fifty feet above its present level ; and the earliest transport, being covered with sub-marine forests, shows that the sea was at that epoch at least fifty feet lower than it now is. (See 4th vol. Geol. Trans. of Cornwall, p. 466, et seq.) In the lowest or oldest deposit the tin-ore (stream-tin) is found in the form of sand and gravel mixed with earthy substances : it affords the purest kind of tin, known in the market by the name of grain tin ; and appears to be the source from which the ancients derived all their tin.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The eastern part of this parish consists of granite, forming a portion of an extensive group of this rock, in which are situated Roughtor and Brown Willy, the highest hills in Cornwall. This granite is of the or dinary kind, large grained, and often porphyritic. It contains beds of fine-grained rocks, in some of which crystalline felspar, quartz, and mica, constitute the entire mass ; but in others these minerals are embedded in a basis of compact, or rather of granular felspar, which is itself apparently a compound of felspar and quartz b 2"], [48, "4 ST. AGNES. The junction of the granite with slate is concealed by a large track of marsh and bog; adjoining to which is a dreary waste of common, resting on an irregular bed of quartzose gravel, derived from the granite hills, and evidently of diluvial origin. This eastern part is sterile, merely affording a scanty subsistence to cattle during the summer. The remainder of the parish is composed of felspar and hornblend rocks, traversed here and there by courses of granitic elvan, a rock in every respect similar to that occurring in the granite. One of these courses may be seen by the road side near the rivulet of Pencarrow. Here the country is wooded and cultivated, exhibiting some picturesque scenes of hill and dale; so characteristic of the hornblend rock near granite. ST. AGNES. HALS.

God, in the name of St. Agnes, as a daughter church to Peransand, by Dr. Peter Courtenay, then Bishop of Exon.* St. Agnes was a Roman by birth, anno Dom. 285 descended of noble ancestors, and being beautiful of body and mind, at 13 years of age was courted in mar riage by the son of Sempronius, then governor of Rome; but because he was no Christian she utterly refused his address, who complained thereof to his father; that im mediately he sent for Agnes, and renewed the proposals of marriage made to her by his son, making larger offers for her advantage, which altogether proving ineffec tual, Sempronius asked her whether she would adore and sacrifice to the Roman gods, and abandon the supersti tion of the Christians, but she, proving constant to her religion, utterly refused to do that also ; whereupon she was committed to prison, from thence, after much hard durance, sent among persons of ill fame, where her in nocence and purity were miraculously preserved, till at length, by the Governor's order, she was committed to the flames, which immediately parted asunder, and did her no harm; whereupon the Governor, and Auspitius his agent, commanded her to be taken out of the fire, and forthwith to be beheaded by the common hangman, 20 January, anno Dom. 304, in the latter end of the reign of Dioclesian, or in the beginning of Constantius and Galerius. St. Ambrose wrote her life. St. Isidore, St. Augustine, Demetrius, and Prudentius, with Aloysy Lessomanus, Bishop of Seville, have all written very commendable things of her.

This is that well-known place called St. Agnes' Ball, that is to say, St. Agnes' pestis, or plague, so named from the hard, deep, and dangerous labour of the tin ners there, out of which mountain hath been digged up, for at least 150 years' space, about ten thousand pounds worth of tin per annum; which keeps daily emploved about the same 1,000 persons, who for the most part spend their time in hard and dangerous labours as afore said, in order to get a poor livelihood for themselves and families, in the pursuit of which, here and in other places, many of those poor men yearly by sad accidents lose their lives. The natural circumstances of this Ball is a subject as worthy the consideration of the most sage virtuosos, or natural philosophers; for, though it be a stupendous and amazing high mountain, abutting upon the Irish sea, or St. George's Channel, rising pyramidally from the same at least 90 fathom above the sea and contigu ous lands, yet on the lop thereof, under those spar-stone graves, or burying-|.laces, is discovered by the tinners, five foot deep, good arable land or earth ; under that, for six foot deep, is found a fine sort of white and yel low clay, of which tobacco-pipes have been made; beneath this clay is a laying of sea-sand and nice totty stones. Two or three hundred fathoms from the sea,"], [51, "7 ST. AGNES. and about eighty fathoms above it, under this sand, is to be seen for about five foot deep, nothing but such totty stones as are usually washed on the sea-shore, and in many of them grains of tin. Under those stones the soil or matter of the earth, for five or six feet deep, is nothing to be seen but carne-tyer, id est, spar-stone land or earth, under which spar-stone earth appears the firm rock, through which tin-loads are wrought or pursued by the tinners fifty, sixty, and seventy fathoms deep. This Ball, or lands containing this diversified matter or soil, contains about eighty acres in circumference ; which amuseth most men how the earth, clay, sand, totty-stones, or spar-stone land, should yet be so high above the solitl rocks to the top of this mountain, un less Noah's flood was universal, and reached to this island, as the labouring tinners believe and tell us. More sure I am, from ocular demonstration, that a quantity of the white sort of sand in this Ball, or hill, washed in a stream or river of clear water, will instantly turn the same water into a milk-white colour, and not to be discerned from milk, as long as you continue to pour the said sand into the river; but this is to be un derstood only of such clean white sand as is made use of and prepared for writing sand-boxes.

The market, for which there does not appear to be any charter on record, has been held from time imme morial for all sorts of wares and provisions, except corn. In 1706, Mr. Tonkin procured the Queen's patent for a weekly market and two fairs; but after the writ of ad quod damnum had been duly executed, and the Queen's sign manual obtained, the grant was revoked in conse quence of a petition from the inhabitants of Truro. A small market is nevertheless kept up ; the market day is Thursday. In a dingle called Chapel-comb, was an ancient chapel known by the name of Porth Chapel, the ruins of which were taken down about the year 1780. Near this spot is St. Agnes' well, of which many miraculous stories are told ; the water is of an excellent quality, and much es teemed. Hals speaks of an ancient free chapel in the manor of Mythian, which had been made a dwelling house. There are remains of an ancient chapel at Mola. Nicholas Kent, of Mingoose, by his will bearing date 1688, gave for the term of 499 years a dwelling house, divided into four tenements and a garden, for poor wi dows of this parish, and charged his lands of Mingoose aud Tereardrene with the repairs of the house ; but it does not appear that it was endowed. One of the schools, founded by the trustees of the fund left for cha ritable uses by the Rev. St. John Elliot, who died in 1760, is at St. Agnes ; the endowment is \u00a30 per annum. There is a Sunday school at St. Agnes, supported by subscription, and numerously attended. THE EDITOR.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE, This parish is one of the great mining districts of Cornwall, abounding in tin and copper ores, but more particularly in the former. It differs, however, from all the other districts, in being remote from the great cen tral masses of granite. This peculiarity has often at tracted the notice of several observers, and has long been considered as a strange anomaly by geologists. vol. i. B 7"], [58, "14 ST. AGNES. The case is not, however, without example; for, al though this tract is distant from the granite both of Redruth and of St. Dennis, yet a small mass of that rock does not exist at Cligga Point, on the confines of the parish. This granite has, indeed, been called by some an elvan, and by others a secondary formation of granite, as has been also that of St. Michael's Mount; but, al though the rock is not in this place of any great extent, it has all the mineralogical and geological characters of the larger masses. Large courses of granite elvan are common in the northern part of the parish, containing short irregular veins and bunches of tin ore. These courses are exten sively exposed in the cliffs, and present a singular ap pearance, somewhat resembling a bank of earth perfo rated by rabbits' burrows, in consequence of the miners having taken the ore wherever it has been exposed to view. The Beacon, a high hill near the church town of St. Agnes, merits particular attention. The lower part is formed of a schistose rock, composed of granular felspar intermixed with particles of quartz and minute scales of mica. Ascending towards the summit, the quartz gra dually increases in quantity, till at last it becomes the prevailing ingredient of the rock, and preserves it against the natural causes of decay; whilst lower down, where the felspar abounds, the rock is extensively disintegrated. On the side of the hill, about three or four hundred feet above the level of the sea, is a deep deposit of diluvium, consist ing of alternate layers of clay and sand. To point out the origin of these layers, and to explain the reason of their occurrence in such an elevated situation, would require long details. For this, and for other interesting par ticulars respecting the phenomena of this parish, the fourth Volume of Transactions, published by the Geological Society of Cornwall, may be consulted."], [59, "15 ST.

ALLEN. TONKIN. Partly in this parish is the great lordship of Gwair nick, id est, the Hay River; a name not unsuitable to the circumstances of the place, for a pleasant river passeth through most fertile meadows beneath the house. This place was the seat of the Bevill family, whose an cestor came into England with the Norman Duke, and was an officer under William Earl of Morton and Corn wall. One of his posterity married a Gwairnick heiress, and so it became the seat of the Bevills for about ten descents; and then, for want of issue male, this lordship, with other fair lands, descended to the two daughters of the last gentleman of that name, who were married to Grenville of Stow and to Arundell of Trerice. The manor of Boswellick, which I take to signify the house by the mill-river, upon the division of Bevill's estates between Grenville and Arundell, this fell to Gren- ville, who sold it to Sir Richard Roberts, of Truro. This gentleman, afterwards Lord Roberts, was in possession ofthe estate towards the latter part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, for his son John Roberts, first Earl of Radnor, was nursed here by Mrs. Tregeagle, the daughter of Degory Polwhele, Esq. and wife of John Tregeagle, Gent, who held a lease of this estate from Sir Richard Roberts. And this was the rise of the Tregeagles ; for John Tregeagle, their son, being foster-brother to tbe said Earl, was afterwards by him made his chief steward, and brought forwards in the world. [The heiress of Tregeagle brought the lease to the Cleathers, who con- tinued to possess it for several generations. The manor is now the property of John Thomas, esq. Vice- Warden ofthe Stannaries, by purchase from the representatives of the Robartes family.

Karo, or Caro, signifying in Cornish a hart or deer, Nancarrow has generally been consi dered to be the deer's valley, and Pencarrow the head of the deer ; but how improperly let any one guess who sees these places. I rather take Car row therefore to be softening of Karrog, a brook or rivulet, so as to signify, in this instance, the valley of brooks ; and in Pencarrow, the head of the brooks. Nancarrow was formerly inhabited by a family of that name, one of whom was stannitor for Blackmore in the Convocation of 13th Elizabeth. It passed by sale to the Borlases of Treludra, and from them to the Scawns. [It now belongs to Mr. Oliver Adams Carveth. Lysons.] Adjoining to the barton of Gwerick, which means simply \"on the river,\" is a tenement called the Gerras, that is, \"the summit or top,\" from its high situation; which I notice in this place on account of its lead mines. Trerice in this parish belonged to a younger branch of the Arundells of Trerice in Newlyn ; from whom it is said to have been wrested not very fairly, by an attorney, Mr. John Coke. The estate now belongs to Lord Fal mouth. Near to Trerice is Trefronick, contracted, as I believe, from Tre-vor-in-ick, \u2014 \" the dwelling in the way to the rivulet.\" This also belonged to the Arundells; passed to John Coke, from him to Borlase, and from Borlase to Kempe.

This parish was rated to the 4s. per pound Land-tax 1696, 204Z. 16s. For the modern name of this church, Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, is of opinion it is derived from the Altar of St. Nun's Pool in this parish, heretofore much frequented for the cure of mad people, the manner of which cure is set down by him, liber ii. p. 123, (p. 289 of Lord Duustanville's edition,) but, for my own part, 1 conceive the word Altar in this place is not to be con strued as a derivative from altare, an altar, whereon offerings or sacrifice was made to God by fire or other wise at this pool ; but rather, as I am better informed, the chancel of the present church was a chapel per taining to the nuns or nunnery once here, afterwards augmented and converted to a vicarage church as it now stands ; and that the ground whereon tbe vicarage house is now extant. Contiguous therewith was of old the nunnery-house itself, wherein those virgins resided ; the stones and materials of which old house are con certed in the new vicarage brave mansion, and, to prove this tradition, there yet appears in the fields the chan nel or water-course wherein the waters of St. Nun's Pool was carried into this old nunnery-house in former ages. So that I conclude the name Altar Nun must be interpreted as a corruption of or derivative from Alter- Nun, to alter or change from one thing to another, from that of a nunnery of religious votaresses, to that"], [67, "23 ALTAR NUN. of a parochial and vicarage church, from whence the same hath its present denomination, as aforesaid. In this parish stands the barton of Tre-lawn-y, id est, the oak grove town, or, \" I am the oak grove town,\" a name at first given and taken from the natu ral circumstances of the place, situate between two hills, then notable for woods or groves of oak timber. Though now there is not left standing any house or trees to countenance this etymology, yet 1 have been told by some of the inhabitants of this parish, that tra dition saith the greatest part of the stones that built the present church and tower of Altar Nun, were brought from the dilapidated walls of Trelawny, and much of the oak timber that roofs the same was also cut and carried from that barton. From this place was denominated that old and famous family of gentlemen surnamed Trelawney, now baronets, as I was informed by my very kind friend Coll. John Trelawney, of Trelawney, deceased, and that one Sir William de Trelawney, lord of this place, suffered it to go in marriage with his base daughter to , from whose heirs, by descent or purchase, it came to Clo berry Hickes, and novv in possession thereof, and is now set for about 70/. per ann. The arms of those Trelawneys were, in a field Argent, a chevron Sable between three oak-leaves Vert, probably in allusion to the leaves of that sort of timber whereof this lazcne con sisted. In this parish, tempore Charles II. lived Peter Jowle or Joull, id est, Peter the Divell, under clerk or deacon of this church, who was 150 and odd years old when he died, and at the age of 100 years had new black hairs that sprung forth on his head amongst those that long before were white with age ; and then also new teeth grew up in his jaws in the places of those that many years before were fallen out of his head. [The name of Joll is still extant in the village ; and the family have"], [68, "24 ALTAR NUN. been remarkable for longevity; but we cannot learn that any tradition exists relating to Peter Joll, nor does his name appear in the register.

Thomas Parr lived 153 years old, and is buried in Westminster Abbey, tempore Charles 11. It is reported of Zamkees, the Samothracian, that after he had lived 104 years, new young teeth sprung up in his jaws in the room of those that were fallen out long before.

It is obvious to any one, that the name of this parish can signify no other than an Altar or church dedicated to St. Nunne; which St. Nunne, being in some accounts called Naunita or Nannites, and in others Novita, is (as Leland tells us) said to have been the daughter of an Earl of Cornwall, and mother of St. David, the fa mous Archbishop of Menevia, from him called St. David's. THE EDITOR. St. N un is stated to have been the mother of St. David. About a mile from the cathedral of St. David's are the remains of a chapel, near a consecrated pool or well, dedicated to St. Nun, where trifling oblations are said to be still made. This coincidence of the two pools is curious, although I do not find that the water at Mene via has the virtue of curing insanity. The account given by Mr. Carew of the practice at Altar Nun is as follows : \" The water running from St. Nun's well fell into a square and inclosed walled plot, which might be filled at what depth they listed. Upon this wall was the frantic person set to stand, his back towards the pool;"], [69, "ALTAR NUN. 25 and from thence, with a sudden blow in the breast, tum bled headlong into the pond ; where a strong fellow, provided for the nonce, took him, and tossed him up aud down, alongst and athwart the water, till the patient, by foregoing his strength, had somewhat forgot his fury. Then was he conveyed to the church and certain masses sung over him ; upon which handling, if his right wits returned, St. Nun had the thanks ; but if there appeared small amendment, he was bowssened again and again, while there remained in him any hope of life or re- covery.\" The second of March is dedicated to St. Nun, and said formerly to be observed throughout Wales, as was the third to St. Lily, surnamed Gwas-Dewy, David's men.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The western and south-western parts of this extensive parish are composed of granite and of hornblend rocks, which surround the former, and recline upon them. This portion is in every respect similar to the parish of Ad vent. At Trewint a very fine compact felspar occurs, im bedded in green stone ; and proceeding eastward on the"], [70, "26 ALTAR NUN. v Launceston road, hornblend slate prevails, and affords a very fertile soil. Descending the hill to Pellaphant, masses of compact rock protrude from beneath the soil. They are composed of compact felspar, aggregated with lamellar hornblend, forming a kind of sienite. But the most interesting object in this parish is to be found a little to the north of this last place, on the side of the hill sloping down to the river Jnny. It is a magnesian rock, and it is quarried for building-stones, yielding large blocks, which are sufficiently soft at the time of their being raised, to allow of their being cut through by a common handsaw. A considerable quantity of this stone has been used in building a very large house, denominated a cottage by the Duke of Bedford, at En sleigh, on the eastern bank of the Tamma. The stone appears, however, to have one bad quality: the surface, after a slight disintegration from exposure to the atmo sphere, becomes covered over with ocherous spots, ow ing to the presence of a scaly mineral resembling dial lage, which is disseminated through the rock. This magnesian rock has all the characters of pitstones, the lapis ollaris of the ancients ; and it is a curious cir cumstance, that on opening some old workings near this place, several antique vessels were found resembling pipkins and shallow pans made out of this material. The immediate connection of this bed of ollareous serpentine with the adjacent rocks, is not disclosed ; but it is succeeded by talc ore, slate, and limestone, on the other side of the river. ST.

This promontory of land, commonly called St An thony point, which on the east side boundeth Falmouth harbour from the British Ocean, not only from the name of the priory here St. Mary de Vail aforesaid, but from the natural circumstances of the place, I take to be the Valuba or Valubia of Ptolemy, which consisteth of a compound of two British words Val and Ubia, which signifies the Vale point or promontory, or the point or promontory of land that bounds or terminates the river Val as aforesaid. Note also, that in British Cornish, B, V, and F, are letters indifferently used one"], [73, "29 ST. ANTHONY IN POWDER. for the other; so that Falubia and Valubia are synony mous words. Otherwise, Val-eba is the ebbing or reflux ofthe river Val. TONKIN. In this parish lies the manor of Bohurtha, or Bos wartha. The higher house or dwelling under Boswartha, is situated on a small creek of a sea, a small place called Porth : this belongs to the family of Spry. The land im mediately beyond it, being covered with sand, is known by the name of Tower, which is common to all like places along the coast. ' THE EDITOR Mr. Hals states St. Anthony, the hermit of Egypt, to be the patron Saint of this parish, and of the other two known by the same name. This St. Anthony is the re puted founder of the ascetic Anchorites, from whose assemblies in after times, monks, and subsequently friars, or begging monks, derive their origin. He is said to have lived from the year 251 to the year 356 ; to have been the friend of St. Athanasius, and to have held some correspondence with Emperor Constantine. But as the two western points form part of the sea coast, and the third is situated on a navigable river, it seems to be most probable that they are all dedicated to the more popular Saint in modern times, St. Anthony of Padua, the universal patron of fishermen. This St. Anthony was a native of Lusitania, having been born at Lisbon in 1195, and christened Ferdinand, which name he laid aside for that of Anthony, in honour of the Egyptian hermit, on his entering into the order of St. Francis. His long residence at Padua is said to have procured for him the cognomen of that place, but the addition of Padua is much more likely to have derived its origin from the locality of bis legendary miracle. Actuated by the spirit of fanaticism common in those times, St. Anthony endeavoured to conceal and to ren der useless all the learning and all the powers of elo-"], [74, "30 ST. ANTHONY IN POWDER. quence which he had previously acquired as a canon regular of St. Austin at Lisbon, and during a residence of eight years with the same order at Coimbra. Having become a friar, he employed himself as a menial in the kitchen, or in sweeping the cells, till an accident dis covered to the superiors the value and importance of their newly acquired brother. The intelligence was con veyed to St. Francis, the renowned founder of the Friars Minors, from whom a letter to our Saint is preserved : \" To my most dear brother Anthony, Friar Francis wisheth health in Jesus Christ. It seemeth good to me, that you should read sacred Theology to the friars ; yet so that you do not prejudice yourself by too great ear nestness in studies ; and be careful that you do not ex tinguish in yourself or in them the spirit of holy prayer.\" All the accounts remaining of St. Anthony agree in representing him to posterity as an example of learning, of piety, and of zeal. These qualities, possessed how ever in common with thousands of others, would have failed to make his name known to after times, if a legend had not established his fame as a Saint, and elevated him to the high station of protector and patron of fisher men all over the Christian world. The legend may be best conveyed in the poetry of Dr. Darwin : So when the Saint from Padua's graceless land, In silent anguish sought the barren strand, High on the shatter'd beach sublime he stood, Still'd with his waving arm the babbling flood ; \" To man's dull ear,\" he cry'd, \" I call in vain, \" Hear me, ye scaly tenants of the main ! \" Misshapen seals approach in circling flocks, In dusky mail the tortoise climbs the rocks, Torpedoes, sharks, rays, turbots, dolphins, pour Their twinkling squadrons round the glittering shore j With tangled fins, behind, huge phoc\u00e6 glide, And whales, and grampi swell the distant tide. Then kneel'd the hoary Seer, to Heaven addiess'd His fiery eyes, and smote his sounding breast, \" Bless ye the Lord ! \" with thundering voice he cry'd ; \" Bless ye the Lord ! \" the bending shures reply'd ;"], [75, "31 ST. ANTHONY IN POWDER. The winds and waters caught the sacred word, And mingling echoes shouted, \" Bless the Lord ! The listening shoals the quick contagion feel, Pant on the floods, inebriate with their zeal, Ope their wide jaws, and bow their slimy heads, And dash with frantic fins their foamy beds. The parish feasts do not serve in these parishes to in dicate the patron saint. Anthony in Kerrier has its feast on the Sunday near est St. Stephen's day, December 26th. Anthony in Powder on the Sunday nearest to the 10th of August. ' Anthony in East has not any feast.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. St. Anthony is situated in the calcareous group of the slate formation, and is composed of a glossy blue and fine grained slate, which alternates with a coarse blue rock abounding in scales of mica, and is more or less lamellar according to its proportion of this mineral : this com- pact rock readily disintegrates, assuming various yellow- ish tints, and an arenaceous appearance; indeed, it is seldom seen but in that condition, and it has therefore been sometimes mistaken by geologists for a variety of sand-stone. At Porth there is a narrow neck of land, on the upper part of which lies a sandbank abounding in perfect shells, which are arranged in layers, and appear similar to those of the adjacent beach. This bank is at least thirty vol. i. c 8"], [76, "32 ST. ANTHONY IN POWDER. feet above high water-mark, and it is covered with a stratum of earth in cultivation. The sand is silicious, and becomes in the lower part intermixed with pebbles, resembling in this respect the banks on the shores of Mount's Bay. This affords an example of an ancient beach elevated above the one now in existence. The whole coast of Cornwall furnishes numerous instances of this occurrence, and the former beach is uniformly at the same elevation above that actually in existence, indicating that the sea must, at some former period, have joined the land at a line now higher than the present beach by that difference. ST. ANTHONY IN EAST. HALS. St. Anthony hath upon the north St. German's Creek ; south, St. John's ; east, Tamesworth Haven, or Saltash River, with part of Sbeviock. This parish is situate in the hundred of Eastwell-shire, so called from Mark's- Well, in Landrake, that is to say, the Earl's well, viz. the Earl of Cornwall's well, perhaps by some of those princes founded, and accordingly from them deno minated, who were originally lord of all the Cornish can treds. At the time of the Conqueror's tax, as I said before, there was no suc'.i district charged therein as Anthony ; so that this parish or tract of land then was rated either under the names of Abbi-town, now St. German's or Cudan-Beke.

East Anthony, in this parish, is the dwelling of the ancient and famous family of gentlemen, the Carews, now Baronets; which lands descended to them by mar riage from one of the daughters of Sir Edward Court ney, Knt. of Boconock, whose mother was Philippa, the sole daughter and heir (or one of the coheirs) of Sir Warren Archdeacon, Knt. of this place, a person and family of great fame and estate in former ages ; for thus it is recorded that Thomas Archdeacon, of this place, was Sheriff of Cornwall 7th Edward II. Walter L'erch-Deacon was also Sheriff of Cornwall 6th Rich. II. 1383. Which family gave for their arms, in a field Argent, three chevronels Sable, which was lately extant in the glass windows of Leskeard church. From Sir Nicholas Baron Carew's fourth son, Alex- ander, by the aforesaid Jone Courteney (he is called Baron St. Carew, for that he was summoned by writ, and by that name to sit in Parliament 3d Edward IV. as a Baron), the gentlemen ever since, and him now in possession of this lordship, are lineally de- scended.

Sir Richard Carew, Bart, and William his brother. Mr. John Carew, son or brother of Sir Alexander last mentioned, was executed as one of the Regicides of King Charles I. l66l. Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 65, (p. 180 of Lord Dunstanville's edition,) tells us that his first ancestor came out of France with William the Conqueror, by the name of Karrow. In the same book, p. 103, (p. 246 of Lord Dunstanville,) he said that Carew, of ancient Carru, was, and Carrueis, a plough in French ; but then it should have been writ ten Carue, or Charoue ; and to countenance this opinion of this family's French descent, Camden, in his Re mains, p. 143, tells us that the same holds by tradition, I know not how truly, that Adam, or rather Arnold de Montgomery, marrying the daughter of Carew of Molesford, her son, relinquishing his own name, left to his posterity his mother's name, Carew, from whome the Carews of Surrey, Devon, and Cornwall, are de scended. Contrary to this opinion, Prince, in his Worthies of Devon, p. 148, saith that Walter de Windsor, about the time of the Norman Conquest, a Norman Frenchman, (as some say Governor, Castel lan, Constable, or Steward of Windsor Castle, son of that Otho, that came in with William the Conqueror,) had issue William and Gerald his sons, who styled them selves after the mode of that age, William and Gerald of Windsor from the places of their residence, or for that they were born there; from William, the Lord Wind sor is descended, and from Gerald, the Fitz-Geralds Earls of Kildare, and the Carews of England. Gerald of Windsor was Steward or Castellan of the Castle of Pembrook, of Carew, in Wales, upon whom King Henry I. bestowed Molesford, in Berkshire; he married Nesta, daughter of Rosse, Prince cf South Wales, to whom the said King gave the Castle of Carew in those parts ; Gerald had issue by Nesta, Otho de Windsor,"], [79, "35 ST. ANTHONY. who had issue William de Windsor or Carew, to whom King John, by deed dated 1212, made a further grant of Molesford, reciting the former deed of King Henry I. to his grandfather. So that this William was the first of this family that assumed the name of Carew. Thus Prince again, the author of the Antiquities of Oxford, is positive that this family of Carew was denominated from Castle Carew, in Pembrokeshire, and not otherwise. Thus God in his providence, to check our presumptious inquisitions and pretensions, hath wrapped all things in uncertainty, bars us from long antiquity, and bounds our search within the compass of some few ages, scarcely affording any true record of pedigrees or descents as far back as the Norman Conquest, whatsoever to the con trary is by some men and families pretended. Lastly, as this family was denominated from one of their ancestors being Constable or Castellan of the Castle of Carew, in Pembrokeshire, for carewr doth not signify a plough in British, for ardar, aradr, arar, is a plough in Welsh, Cornish, and Armoric, and kaer, caer, is a castle or fortified place. Carew, caer-ew, care-eff, is he, his, or her, Castle, as ipie, ipea, ipeum. See Ffloyd. Caer-eau, British Saxon, is a castle or fortified place of water, referring perhaps to the medical or purgative waters there. As Mr. Carew saith his family was denominated from one Carrow or Karrow that came into England with William the Conqueror, so I must tell you that there was in Cornwall and Devon, not long since, a genteel family surnamed Carrow (id est, deer) who gave for their armes, as appears from Nich. Upton's Latin ma nuscript book of Heraldry, before printing was invented, now in my custody, dated 1444, in those words, \" Mon sieur Joh'is de Carrow, port d'oriii lyons passant sable,\" which is now the arms of those gentlemen before-men tioned, named Carew.

In the town of St. Austell liveth Henry Hawkins, Gent, attorney at law (younger brother of Mr. Hawkins of Creed), who by his judgment, skill, care, and pains\u00bb in his calling hath exalted his fame and estate to a great degree. He married Scobell, and giveth for his arms, Argent, on a saltire Sable, five fleur de lis. His two sons by Scobell died without issue, and his daughters were married to Hoblyn, Moyle, Hext, and Hawkins, of Helston; and the youngest of thatsex, with all his lands aod riches, was married to Tremayne, of St. Ive, Esq. The manor of Tow-ing-ton, alias Taw-ing-ton afore said, taxed in the Domesday Book, 1087, is invested with the jurisdiction of a court leet; and signifies \"silence in town,\" or \"extraordinary silence in town,\" viz. when that court sitteth ; which was afterwards by King Ed ward III. 1336, concerted or fixed into the Duchy of Cornwall, by charter (see Lestwithell), with its appurte nances. In this parish was born Jonathan Upcott, son of George Upcott, Gent, by Mrs. May, of High Cross, Ranger of the Parks to John Lord Robartes in Corn wall, as also in Ireland, when he was Lord Deputy there. This gentleman, having risen through various steps in the army, during the reigns of Charles II. James II."], [90, "46 ST.

At last, being ordered to take part in a desperate assault on the French atEnghein, where the Dutch and Spanish soldiers had proved better men at their heels than at their hands, he bravely lost his life, together with the greater part of his men. King William is said in the course of this war to have grown prodigal of Englishmen's valour, blood, and lives, as he had before been of their money ; for when any dangerous fort was to be attempted, which the Dutch and Spanish soldiers refused, he commanded the English to perform it, who, being led away by the vanity of being accounted valiant soldiers, and for the honour of the English nation, quickly undertook such direful posts, though to their own destruction.

The manor of Tewynton, alias Tewington, takes its name from the chief place, Tewor, which, though it generally means \" heaps of sand,\" cannot be so inter preted here ; and much less applicable is the etymology"], [91, "47 ST. AUSTELL. given by Mr. Hals, of \" silence in town,\" but Tewor means a hillock generally, so that Tewynton means, in the mixed derivation common in Cornwall from British and Saxon, \" the town on a small hill.\" This place was the seat of the Sowles before they removed to Penrice, and affords a quarry of excellent stone. Pentwan, the \" head of the hillocks of sand.\" Lower Pentwan is situated at the mouth ofthe St.Austell river, which would form a pretty little port, were it not for the bar of sand made by the waste brought down from the tin-works, so that small craft only can get in, and that at spring-tides. It is a handsome village, and in good seasons great stores of fish are brought in here. Pelniddon, \"the top of the ford,\" from \"nyd,\" a ford, was the seat of the knightly family bearing the same name. Trenorren, which I take to be compounded of Tre nore-en, \" the town of the point,\" from the Bleak Head, close by which it lies. THE EDITOR In Henry the Eighth's reign, Leland described St. Austell as a poor village, nor is it mentioned as a place of any consequence either by Caffew Ar Norden. It first rose into consequence from itejJicinity fo Polgooth and other considerable mines: it js now a considerable thoroughfare; the great road from Plymouth to the Land's End was brought through it about the year 1760. The export of china clay, the decomposed or never consolidated felspar, to all the great manufac tories of earthenware throughout England, affords em ployment to industry and to capital, in a manner more steady, and therefore more permanently beneficial, than can ever be produced by the working of mines. To facilitate their commerce, and generally to im prove the whole district, a harbour was constructed at Seaforth about forty years ago by Mr. Charles Rash-"], [92, "48 ST. AUSTELL. leigh ; a gentleman who will long be remembered, as uniting strong abilities with energy of mind, and libe rality as well of practice as of sentiment. His name is perpetuated in the port and in the buildings surround ing it, which have received by public acclamation the appropriate distinction of Charlestown. [The spot was formerly called Porthmear, and was too inconsider able to be mentioned in Martyn's map. In 1790 it con tained only nine inhabitants. In consequence of the commodious harbour, the docks, and shipwrights' yards, and the pilchard fishery established by Mr. Rashleigh, it has gradually increased to be a large village. Lysons.] More recent inventions have suggested an iron rail way from St. Austell along the descending vale to a new harbour at Pa&tner-. The works are just now completed (1832), and they promise to add still greater facilities to commerce than those at Charlestown. The other principal villages in this parish areCarvath, Corbean, Pentewan or Pentuan, Porthpean, Rescorla, Tregonissy, Tregorick, Trenarren, and Trethergy. The church and town of St. Austell are well worthy of notice. The church is much decorated on its exterior surface of freestone by figures and scrolls worked on the stone; and over the south porch is an ancient inscrip tion, kych inri, never explained (engraved in Lysons, p. ccxxxii). The tower, although not so lofty as that at Probus, is perhaps more elegant in its form and proportion. The inside of the church presents a light and pleasing appearance, in consequence of the large space occupied by the windows. The font is in the form of a bowl, carved with rude monsters, standing on a round column, and supported by four small pillars, which have monks' heads for their capitals. It is engraved in Lysons, p. ccxxxiii. An almshouse, with six apartments for poor persons, was erected in 1809."], [93, "49 ST. AUSTELL. In the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. ix. pi. viii. and vol. xi. pi. vii. are engravings of a silver cup, several rings, and other pieces of jewellery, of very early workmanship, which were found, together with a coin of Burgred king of Mercia (expelled from his dominions in 874), in a stream-work in this parish, in the year 1774. They were deposited in a silver cup, which has since been used for the sacramental wine at the church ; and there fore had probably been originally collected at some earlier period.

This parish, so important in an economical point of view, on account of its minal production, affords a vast fund of geological information. Its north ern part is composed of granite ; its southern part of various rocks belonging to the porphyritic group. Its granite on the eastern side is like that of Alternun, and contains layers which abound in porphyritic crystals of felspar. On the western side it comprises several kinds of this rock; some characterised by the proportions of shorl that enter into their composition; and others by containing talc instead of mica, and by the felspar being prone to an extensive decay, in which state it fur nishes porcelain clay (or china clay) for the potteries. A more particular description of these kinds of granite E"], [94, "50 ST. AUSTELL. will be given hereafter, in the accounts of St. Stephen's, and of the adjacent parishes. Carclaze tin mine must not, however, be passed by, as it is one of the greatest curiosities in Cornwall. This mine is worked \"open to the day\" (according to the miners' term), that is, like a quarry. It is of a considerable depth; and its super ficies exceeds several acres in extent. It is excavated entirely in a white granite, somewhat similar to the dis integrating variety above alluded to; and when the sun shines, the reflection of light is so exceedingly dazzling as to be almost insupportable. The tin ore occurs here intermixed with shorl and quartz, in the form of short irregular veins, which traverse the granite in every direction, and so abundant, that the whole rock requires to be pounded and washed to complete an entire separa tion of the ore. Hornblend rocks succeed the granite, and produce a red fertile soil. These extend a little to the south of the town of St. Austell, and are followed by a blue lamelar slate, in which the mines are situated. This rock is much softer, and more argillaceous than the hornblend slate, and decomposes into a light-coloured soil. The matrix of its lodes abound in chlorite: it is probably a a chlorite schist. This formation is traversed by several beds of felspar, porphyry (elvan courses), in the western side of the parish, which run north-east and south-west, in a somewhat tortuous manner, and dip towards the gra nite. One of these elvans, near Pentewan, has been ex tensively quarried, and is much esteemed as a building material. This chlorite slate also contains, in the cove at Duporth, a bed of compact magnesian rock, abound ing in asbestos ; and passes on either hand into the sur rounding slate, by means of layers of talcous schist. This parish has long been celebrated for its stream works, which are diluvial beds containing tin ore. They are generally found in deep vallies where rivulets flow, which are used in separating the tin ore, by its inferior"], [95, "51 ST. AUSTELL. specific gravity, from common stones or pebbles; hence the name of \"stream-works.\" The nature of these de positsvaries according to the positions which they occupy between the sea and the granite; whence the stannifer ous strata were derived. Pentewan stream-work is one of the most interesting in the whole county. Its lowest bed consists of pebbles, gravel, and tin ore, and it rests on the solid rock. Im mediately above this tin-ground is a black stratum of ve getable remains, among which are stumps of trees, stand ing erect, with their roots penetrating downwards into the bed of gravel. This subterranean forest stands forty eight feet below high-water mark; showing that there must have been a change in the relative sea level. On this vegetable bed reposes a thick stratum of silt, in termixed with horns of deer, and with other relics of land animals, and also with detached pieces of timber. This silt is of the same description as that now forming in the Truro river, and in other estuaries on the coast; and it contains layers of shells peculiar to such situ ations. This silt is covered by a deep deposit of siliceous sand, in which occur various remains, principally of marine origin ; and lastly, over this lies another bed of silt like the preceding, which reaches to the surface, where a thin marsh soil is now in a state of cultivation. The upper bed of silt is nearly on a level with the sea, being separated and protected from it by the interposition of a sandy beach. Many theoretical observations and reflections would naturally present themselves, after a statement of these facts ; but such would be more appropriate to a separate treatise, than to a series of notices on individual parishes. e 2"], [96, "52 ST.

Qu\u00e6ry, whether the word fanum be not, by the scribe, a corruption of Foy-town ? In the inquisition afore said, however, let it be remembered that, Ecclesia de Fanum must be interpreted as the church or temple, con secrated to divine service, appropriated to the house of Tywardreth, as both those churches of Fowey and St. Blazey are. As for the tutelar guardian from whom the same and the parish is denominated, Blaze, he was born in Sebaste, a city of Cappadocia in Asia, whereof he was bishop, and governed his church so well, that the priests of the idols (then worshipped comparatively all the world over,) took distaste at him for his preach ments against idolatry ; and exhibited a complaint against him to Agricolaus, the emperor Dioclesian's president in those parts, by whom he was examined as to this and other parts of Christian religion ; which he"], [97, "ST. BLAZEY. 53 would not retract ; wherefore he was by him committed to prison, scourged with the utmost severity that could be invented, and afterwards, by a special order, under the hand of Agricolaus, beheaded by the common hangman, 15th Feb. anno Dom. 298, temp. Dioclesiani. The church celebrateth the festival of this famous saint, bishop, and martyr, February 3. The Council of Lyons, ann. Dom. 1244, under the Emperor Frederick and Pope Innocent the Fourth, amongst other things instituted certain new festivals for canonizing of saints ; after which time, in the Inquisition but now mentioned, we shall find most of the names of our Cornish churches distinguished by the prefixed title of saint, viz. such person as the same when first conse crated was dedicated to (who before that time had been canonized by the church of Rome) ; though, as I hinted before, there is but one church or person named in Domesday Roll to whom is given the appellation of saint, about two hundred years before. In this church town of St. Blazey there is a public fair kept on the festival day of this saint, February 3, and the festivals of most other Cornish saints, to whose guardianship churches are dedicated, are solemnly kept yearly in other places. Ro-sillian, in this parish, formerly the lands of Kel lyow, is now the dwelling of Henry Scobell, Gent, bro ther to Mr. Scobell of St. Austell, before mentioned, who giveth the same arms as that family doth. In this parish also, not long since, lived Hugh Wil liams, Gent, attorney-at-law, youngest son of Richard Williams, of Trewithan in Probus, that married Robins and Frowick, and gave the same arms as that family doth ; who at length, upon some discontent, with a rope or halter privately hanged or strangled himself to death in his own house (as was reported), though the coroner's inquest found it a chance only, tempore William III.

In this parish liveth Cur-lyon, Gent, that married Hawkins, and giveth for his arms, in a field a bezant between two castles. Now, though the name be local, from a place in Keye parish so called, yet if I were admitted to judge or conjecture, I would say this family of Cur-Lvon, by its name and arms, were the descend ants of Richard Curlyon, alias King Richard I. of whom our chronologers say, that a priest of France told him he had three daughters, Pride, Covetousness, and Lechery; which three daughters the King replied he would thus dispose of: 1, Pride to the Templars and Hospitalers; 2, Covetousness to the Monks of the Cis tertian order ; and, 3, Lechery to the clergy in general.

In this parish is Roselian, or Rose-Sillian, an ancient seat belonging to the family of Kellio, and was lately the residence of Shadrack Vincent Vincent, Esq. in right of his wife, daughter of Richard Kellio, Esq. This Shadrack Vincent was the second son of Henry Vincent, of Tresimple.

His son Thomas has mar ried Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Mr. Philip Haw kins, of Pennance, by whom he hath several children. This last Thomas was in the commission of the peace, and died in this present Jan. (1732) leaving his eldest son, Philip, a minor. This property belonged in former times to the Bodregens. the editor. The popular legends of St. Blaze relate that he was most barbarously lacerated with wool-combs, which sufficiently accounts for his having been adopted as the patron of all persons concerned in the manufacture of cloth. There is an idle tradition of the exact spot where St. Blaze landed; but it is quite certain that he never was in the west of Europe; nor can any reason now be assigned for the selection of this saint, beyond that of his general popularity. About the year 1774 a curious piece of machinery was exhibited all over England, which repre sented the whole manufacture of broadcloth, from the shearing of the wool to the last operation of pressing. A small figure was actually at work on each separate pro cess ; and over them all, as a general director, and ar rayed in bis pontifical habit and mitre, appeared Bishop Blaze. He is the patron of Ragusa. The derivation of Carlyon from Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, seems to be equally puerile, unfounded, and ab surd. Car, or Caer, is evidently a fortified place; and Lyon must be one of those corruptions, more common than any other, of a word which has lost its appropriate"], [100, "56 ST. BLAZEY. meaning, into another word of a similar sound and in common use. The arms of Carlyon are, Argent, a chev ron Gules between three moor cocks Sable, limbed and wattled Gules. In modern times St. Blazey has acquired distinction by giving birth to Ralph Allen, known over England as Mr. Allen of Bath. This gentleman acquired a large fortune through the medium of conferring important benefits on his country, and he employed it in promot ing literature and sciences on the most extensive scale. Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, Gay, were the inmates of his house. Warburton was mainly through his influence advanced to the highest station in our church. And, On all occasions was his hand held forth At pity's call to succour modest worth. This extraordinary man was the son of an innkeeper in a village on the road-side, called St. Blazey Highway. He is stated by Mr. Polwhele to have been placed under the care of his grandmother, who kept the post-office at St. Columb ; and that an inspector was so much struck by the neatness and regularity of young Allen's accounts as to procure for him some situation in a more extensive establishment. It is probable that he must have been placed in the post office at Bath. Mr. Pol whele adds that he was there patronised by General Wade. Previously to this period, letters were conveyed along certain great roads emanating from the capital, but with out any communication one with the other. Mr. Allen first conceived the idea of uniting these lines by what has been termed cross posts, and Bath became the origi nal station of this most important contrivance, which has now expanded itself over the whole country like the meshes of a net, affording such facility and speed as to astonish those who experience their benefit, and which could not have been hoped for in times past. It is much to be lamented that the progress of Mr."], [101, "57 ST. BLAZEY. Allen, from the commencement of his career in this most interesting pursuit, up to the attainment of his object by its complete establishment at Bath cannot be traced ; nor the source ascertained from whence his funds were derived. It appears that Mr. Allen risked the chance of taking the revenues to be derived from his new institution for a term of years, at a certain annual payment to the State ; or, in official language, that he farmed them; and his success proved commen surate to the ability, exertion, and persevering industry employed in carrying the plan into effect: so that on the expiration of the first term, a renewal was taken at an advanced rent of some tens of thousands a-year. Mr. Allen fixed himself at Bath, and built the splendid mansion of Prior Park with the oolite of that district, or Bath stone, which he first quarried on an extensive scale and brought into general use. At Prior Park every man distinguished in any way was a welcome guest, and tbe proprietor has received most justly, deserved tributes of applause from many capable of erecting monuments to his memory more durable than those of brass or stone ; but one frequently noticed has ever appeared to me inadequate. It does indeed represent the image of a private gentleman, endowed with goodness of heart, some learning, and a tolerable judgment ; but if Mr. Fielding's Allworthy was really meant to pourtray Mr. Allen, one may seek in vain for any resemblance of a man, who, by energy of mind and indefatigable exer tions conferred so great a benefit on his country, that the wealth acquired by himself seemed no more than the necessary appendage to such public service. Mr. Allen died in 1764; but his spirit still hovered over Bath, and impelled individuals brought forward in his school, to make the second and last improvement in our mail conveyances by substituting the rapid speed of a coach, with its safety' and accommodation of passen gers, for the slow and solitary progress of a postman on"], [102, "58 ST. BLAZEY. horseback. This system commenced in 1784, twenty years after Mr. Allen's decease. Mail coaches led to a general improvement of roads, and this again to an in crease in the speed of coaches, while the reticulations of cross posts became more fine, with intersections in every possible direction, and the whole continues still improv ing; so that, morally speaking, the illustrious founder still lives and breathes among us. Mr. Allen had a sister, whom I faintly remember the widow of a Mr. Elliott, and left with an only daughter. The old lady had great pleasure in relating what she had seen and heard at Prior Park, her having been there in company with Pope, Swift, Thomson, &c. and from her is derived the story related by Mr. Polwhele of Mr. Hugh Boscowen. The daughter married Mr. Thomas Daniell, then chief clerk to Mr. Lemon, an individual not moving in a sphere so splendid as that of Mr. Allen, but probably at least his equal in all the qualities essential to those who fix a new era in the history of whatever they undertake. On Mr. Lemon's decease in 1760, Mr. Daniell was enabled by the bounty of his wife's uncle to take all the large mercantile concern on himself, and having soon afterwards constructed a residence in Truro, Mr. Allen presented him with several ship-loads of Bath stone; and thus Truro, having quarries of excellent silicious building-stone almost in its streets, and with granite distant only a few miles, exhibits the front of its most handsome house encrusted with oolite from Bath. To a similar act of liberality on the part of Mr. Allen, the hospital of St. Bartholomew in London is indebted for an exterior casing of the same stone ; which, in con sequence of the recent improvements and extension of inland navigation, is now brought in great quantities to the metropolis, to Oxford, and to places still more remote from the quarries. I may here perhaps introduce with propriety a relation"], [103, "59 ST. BLAZEY. descriptive of the immense difference between our own times and those of Queen Anne, in respect to the sources and to the diffusion of intelligence. Mr. Sidney Godolphin, occupying the office of Lord High Treasurer, visited more than once the seat in Cornwall from which he derived bis appellation of Earl; no regular conveyances at stated intervals proceeded further west than Exeter, but when certain masses of letters had accumulated, the whole were forwarded by what was called the post. The Lord High Treasurer had a weekly messenger from Exeter bringing letters, despatches, and a newspaper ; and on the fixed day of his arrival all the gentlemen assembled at Godolphin from many miles round to hear the newspaper read in the great hall. This was told to my father by Mr. John Borlase, father to the two Doctor Borlases, who had himself been present. From ten to twenty daily papers now reach Penzance in about forty hours from London. Within my own remembrance a letter leaving London on Monday night arrived at Penzance on Friday morn ing, a letter and its answer occupying at present pre cisely that time.

It is known that within the memory of the last gene ration the sea flowed up to St. Blazey Bridge; and vari ous indications of its having reached half a mile further up the river have been detected : thus showing that the sea, which has encroached on most parts of the coasts of Cornwall, has at the same time been driven back from the land. This effect is usually attributed to the accumulation of detritus brought down from the hills by rivers, more especially when they are in flood, and undoubtedly this must be a generally operative cause ; but in this particular instance the effect must be mainly ascribed to the wearing away of the diluvial sand-bank at the head of the adjoining bay. The volume of this river, and its consequent momentum, not having been sufficient to counteract the deposition of sand by the waves running up the estuary, with which, in their rapid motion, they are always charged.

Forthe compound name Bo-connoc, it is taken from the barton and manor of land still extant there, with reference to the beasts that depastured thereon ; and signifies, pros perous, successful, thriving cows, kine, or cattle. Which place it seems was the voke lands of a considerable tithing or lordship, with jurisdiction, at the time of the Norman Conquest ; for by the name of Boconnoc it was taxed in Domesday roll 2d William I. 1087. However, let it be observed that at the time of the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, before mentioned, 1294, there was no such endowed church extant in Cornwall as Boconnoc ; though in Wolsey's Inquisition 1521, it was taxed to the Pope's annats 9/- 17s. 3d. The patronage is in the Lord Mohun in right of his lordship of Boconnoc aforesaid ; and the parish rated to the 4s. 8d. per pound tax, temp. Wil liam III. 80/. This barton and manor of Boconnoc, in the time of Edward III. was the lands of Sir John Dawney, of Sheviock, knight, whose daughter and heiress Emelyn, was married to Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devon (and third of that name and title, being the son of Hugh Courtenay the 10th Earl of Devon, by Margaret, daugh ter of Humphrey de Bohun, the 8th Earl of Hereford and Essex, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of King"], [108, "64 BOCONNOC.

Upon this Hugh Courtenay, afterwards Sir Hugh Courtenay, Knight, his elder brother Edward, surnamed the blind, at the especial request and instance of his mother, Emelyn, (as Brooke, York Herald, in forms us) did by his indenture, bearing date the 2d of King Henry V. confirm and assure to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, the manors of Gotherington, South allington, and Slancomb-Dawney (from whence that family was denominated) in the county of Devon, who afterwards married Philippa, one of the daughters and heirs of Sir Warren Archdeacon, Knight, of Haccomb in the county of Devon, after which time he lived sometimes in that place, at other whiles at Boconnoc ; whence it is we find in some authors this gentleman is called Sir Hugh Courtenay of Boconnoc, and Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccomb, as if they had been different persons. This Sir Hugh Courtenay had issue, by Arch deacon's daughter, Edward Courtenay of Haccomb ; who after the death of Humphrey Stafford was restored in blood, and made the 16th Earl of Devon, in the first year of the reign of King Henry VII. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Courtenay, of Mo land, Knight, and had issue William Courtenay, 17th Earl of Devon, who married Katherine daughter of King Edward IV. and by her had issue, Henry Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter, executed for treason, temp.

He married Elizabeth Blount, by whom he had issue Edward Courtenay the 18th Earl of Devon (and last of the family of these Courtenays) that died at Padua, in Italy, without issue, 1556, 4th of October."], [109, "65 BOCONNOC. Edward Courtenay of Haccomb, or Boconnoc, afore said 16th Earl of Devon, had four sisters, as is set down in his will, dated 1509, in the first vear of the reign of King Henry VIII. which were thus disposed of in mar riage, \u2014 Elizabeth was married to John Trethyrfe of Trethyrfe, from whom Courtenay of that place, and Vyvyan of Trelowarren is descended; Maud to John Arundell of Tolverne, from whom the Arundells of Sythney, and by females the Trefusis of Trefusis, and the Halses late of Fentongollan are descended : Isabel, the third daughter, was married to William Moune, from whom the Lord Mohun descended : Florence, the fourth sister, was married to John Trelawney, from whom the Trelawneys of Trelawne are descended. Whether this lordship of Boconnoc fell to the Crown by attainder of treason, upon the death of Henry Courte nay, Marquis of Exeter, or was purchased from the Crown, or of the sisters and heirs of the said Edward Courtenay, by Carmenow of Fengollan, I know not; he sold it to the Earl of Bedford ; as the said Francis Rus sell, Earl of Bedford sold it, in 1566, to Reginald Mohun, Esq.

The ancestor of this ancient and famous family of the Mohuns came into England with William the Con queror, by the name of William Mowne or Sapell, and was after the Conquest by him made Governor of Dun ster Castle, who had issue William Mowne the second Lord of Dunster Castle, whose son, the third William, as Matthew Paris saith, did keep and fortify the same against King Stephen, for the use of Maud the Empress It is told us by our chronologers and historians, that he was made Earl of Somerset by King Henry the First, 1135, and that he was founder of a priory of Black Canons of Bruton in Somersetshire, where Edgar Earl of Cornwall had before founded an abbey of Benedic tine monks.

Charles Lord Mohun, the last Baron of this family, being killed in a duel by the Duke of Hamilton, on the 5th of November 1712, left his whole estate by will, dated some time before, to his widow, who sold all the Cornish and Devonshire estates in 1717 for fifty-four thousand pounds (a very cheap bargain) to Thomas Pitt, Esq. commonly called Governor Pitt, in whose possession the manor of Boconnoc now remains. This Charles Lord Mohun was a nobleman of very bright parts, and great natural endowments both of body and mind ; but having had the misfortune to lose his father, while he was yet in the cradle \u2014 and the estate being left to him much involved in lawsuits between his nearest relations, and with a considerable debt \u2014 he had not an education bestowed on him suitable to his birth; and happening to fall into ill company, he was drawn into several extravagancies : but, however, as his years increased, he became so much reclaimed as to give great hopes that he would one day equal the greatest of his prtdecessors; when he was thus unfortunately cut off in the flower of his age. He was twice married. First to Charlotte daughter of Manwaring, Esq. by whom he had only one daugh ter, whom he never owned, and he lived for several years separated from his wife. He had the good fortune, how ever, to get rid of her at last, she being drowned in a passage to Ireland with one of her gallants, about six or seven years before his own death. Fitton Gerrard, Earl of Macclesfield, her maternal uncle, to make him some amends for his bad bargain, gave him by will a good part of his estate, in 1701, which was the occasion of the quarrel between his f 2"], [112, "68 BOCONNOC. Lordship and the Duke of Hamilton; so fatal to them both. His second wife was the widow of Colonel Griffin, of the Green Cloth, by whom he had not any issue. His sister died before him unmarried. THE EDITOR. Boconnoc is universally allowed to be the finest seat in Cornwall. The house stands on an elevation near the union of two valleys, each rendered interesting, beautiful, and picturesque by streams of water flowing through uneven ground, and by native woods of beech and oak, rivalling the trees of our most favoured inland counties, although these vallies originate in wild tracts of land where not a stunted shrub is to be seen. Mr. Thomas Pitt, although remotely descended from a good family, is said to have been the son of a person concerned in trade at Brentford. He must have gone to India at a time when some merchant adventurers, wholly unconscious of impending events, were engaged in laying the foundation of an Empire so vast as to exceed in the number of its subjects even the majesty of Rome itself. Mr. Pitt returned to Europe possessed of a diamond, superior, perhaps, in its combination of size and trans parency, to any one ever exhibited in the western world. It was offered to Queen Anne, and ultimately sold to the Regent Duke of Orleans for the French nation, at a sum exceeding one hundred thousand pounds.* With about half of this large sum Mr. Pitt acquired the property in Cornwall of the last Lord Mo hun, and settled at Boconnoc. He also purchased the burgage tenures, giving the right of franchise at Old Sarum, and represented that place in Parliament. * The exact weight of the diamond is said to be 136| carats. A carat is equal to 31 grains (see the Universal Cambist by Dr. Kelly, vol. i. p. 220, article London). It weighed therefore 433 grains, very nearly nine-tenths of an ounce troy of 480 grains."], [113, "69 BOCONNOC. He had two sons, Robert and Thomas. Robert Pitt who succeeded him at Boconnoc, married Harriet Vil liers, third sister of John Earl Grandison. He died in May 1727, leaving two sons, Thomas Pitt, and Wil liam, afterwards Earl of Chatham. Thomas Pitt, his brother, was created Earl of Londonderry, in conse quence of his marrying the heiress of Ridgeway, who had borne that distinction ; this younger branch became extinct in 1764. Thomas Pitt, his son, engaged most ex tensively in the political speculation, for which Cornwall was then become an ample field. But, having supported the party of Frederick Prince of Wales, he failed of ob taining any ofthe objects to which most speculations are supposed to lead. He married Christiana, sister of George first Lord Lyttelton; by whom he left Thomas Pitt, who, on the elevation of his first cousin, William Pitt, to the chief office in the State, when under twenty-five years of age, was created Baron Camelford in Jan. 1784. He died in 1793, leaving a son Thomas Pitt, the second and last Lord Camelford, and a daughter married to William Wyndham Grenville, Lord Grenville, the present pos- For these 433 grains of diamond, the Regent Duke of Orleans is stated to have given 135,000/. or two thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine pounds troy of standard gold, or nearly one ton one hundred and a quarter avoirdupoise; above thirty-eight thousand four hun dred times its own weight, or seven thousand five hundred and eighty times its bulk. The Regent and his two successors in the government of France, used this diamond as an ornament to their hats on occasions of state. It was stolen during the license of the great Revolution, but recovered.

The personal history of this young man is curious and extraordinary. He became an object of attention in Cornwall almost from his birth. On the event of his christening, in 1775, Boconoc was thrown open for pub lic and indiscriminate entertainment, accompanied by exhibitions of the peculiar athletic exercise in which the Cornish boast to excel all their contemporaries, and to rival the Pal\u00e6str\u00e6 of ancient Greece. A silver bowl of fifteen guineas was the prize ofthe victor (the first who threw five falls), and about fifty pounds were distributed among the vanquished. His education was conducted under a private tutor alone in the seclusion of Boconnoc; but having made an excursion to Plymouth at a time when naval prepa rations were in full activity, he acquired a passion for the sea so strong and rooted, as not to be overcome by all the efforts of authority or of advice. He went on the perilous voyage of discovery con ducted by Captain Vancouver, and in the course of it, he is said to have experienced some harsh treatment on the part of the commmander, which seems to have stamped a new impression on his mind, rendered per manent by the long period during which it was necessa rily concealed. On Lord Camelford's return to England, the effects burst forth in acts of violence against Captain Vancou ver, and from that time, On each adventure rash he roved, As danger for itself he loved. It is impossible not be struck by a general resem blance between the two individuals who last possessed Boconnoc, of the families of Mohun and Pitt. Both seem to have been men of ability and of genius, of in trepid courage and of honour, fond of enterprise, and with vigour of body commensurate to their mental ener-"], [115, "71 BOCONNOC. gies ; but each unfortunately, obeying the impulse of passion and of strong feelings rather than the dictates of reason, was hurried on to an untimely fate. The latter fell by the hand of a person born to the situation of a gentleman, but in other respects little entitled to that distinction. The first Lord Camelford might not only claim a full share of the hereditary talent connected with the names of Lyttelton and of Pitt;* but also literary acquirements and taste obtained under the guidance of his two uncles William Pitt Lord Chatham, and Lord Lyttelton. His gratitude to the latter is commemorated at Boconnoc by a lofty obelisk. Lord Camelford introduced to the rectory of his parish the Reverend Benjamin Forster, a contemporary at Cambridge of congenial taste, and worthy of his friend ship, the associate of Gray and of Mason; and with a mind like theirs suited for retirement and for literary lei sures In his hours of relaxation he adorned the woods and shades, the vales and the rivulets, of Boconnoc with descriptive and appropriate illustrations from ancient and from modern poetry. To the Glebe-house he ap plied, A little lowly hermitage it was, Down in a dale, hard by a forest's side, Far from resort of people that did pass In travail to and fro. Mr. Forster has been long since deceased, his rectory taken down, and most of his friends departed from this life. His memory is for the present preserved by a tablet (brevi et ipsa interitura) bearing the following inscription : * A series of his letters to Mr. Justice Hardinge has been published in Ni chols's Literary Illustrations ofthe Eighteenth Century, vol. vi. pp. 74 \u2014 139. f A large quantity of Mr.Forster's lively correspondence with Richard Gough, esq.

It is therefore omitted ; and the reader desirous of information and entertainment is referred to that curious production of our learned antiquary.] Algar Earl of Cornwall, successor of Ailmer, (as the Monasticon Anglicanum, torn. i. p. 213, and torn. ii. p. 205, informs us,) at his own proper cost and charges re-edified the church of St. Peter at Bodmin, as it now stands; consisting of three roofs, each sixty clothyards long, thirty broad, and twenty high, so that for bulk and magnificence it is parallel to the cathedral of Kirton, and little inferior to that of Exeter. Earl Algar gave the church to a society of Augustines or Black Canons. Afterwards, if Leland's manuscripts may be credited, those Black Canons were displaced, and succeeded by St. Benedict's monks ; and then again those monks were displaced, and succeeded by a nunnery of Bene dictine nuns. Then again, saith he, those nuns were displaced, and succeeded by secular priests; who also were again displaced, and Canons Regular, or Black Canons Augustine, restored to their places ; under which circumstance of religious men Leland found it when"], [118, "74 BODMIN. King Henry the Eighth sent him into Cornwall, to in spect the orders and revenues of the religious houses therein. And in this state it was found by the Com missioners, 26 Henry VIII. when dissolved, at which time its revenue yearly was valued at 270/. 11s. Dug dale; 269/. 11s. lid. Speed. Now this value, the reader must observe, was only the conventionary or annual rent reserved on leases of the priory land, set out to tenants for 99 years, determinable upon lives, and the common way of valuing those old rents was after the rate of ten per cent. ; so that 270/. rent was then worth 2,700/. now worth 6,000/. per annum : which lands and rents are now chiefly in the hands and possession of Godolphin, Buller, Robarts, Morrice, Prideaux, Vivian, Rashleigh, Nicholls, Moyle, Molesworth, and many others. The churches appropriated to this priory were, 1. Bod min, 2. St. Wenn, 3. Withiel, 4. St. Kew, 5. St. Breock, 6. Little Pederick ; 7- Padstow, 8. St. Ervan, 9- Cran tock, 10. Cubert, 11. St.Colomb-minor, 12. Tregony, 13. St. Minver, 14. Lanhydrock, and some others, whereof the priors were either patrons or founders. The Prior of this church of St. Peter kept his trea surer, his steward, almoner, hospitalarius, et infirmarius, that took care of sick and weak beggars and travellers. The priory-house wherein he dwelt is yet extant, though his domestic chapel and burial-place be dilapidated and demolished, all contiguous with the church aforesaid. The jurisdiction and royalty over the river Alan, from Camelford to Padstow Rock, was given to this Prior by Algar Earl of Cornwall, in right of his manor of Hel ston, in this hundred, excepting the right of free fishing to the tenants thereof; a river famous for infinite num ber of those kings of fishes called salmon, which between Midsummer and Christmas are taken there, reputed, by such as are skilled in the gusto or palate, the best of that kind in Cornwall (except the salmon of the Val"], [119, "BODMIN. 75 river, in this county). But, since the dissolution of this priory by King Henry the Eighth, this royalty is dis jointed, if not dismembered from it, and enjoyed in co-partnership by such as are the now owners of its lands and revenues, and by some others whose lands are contiguous with that river ; though tbe now Duchy tenants of the manor of Helston aforesaid still pay barbe agu, or bar-ba-gut money, id est, barbed-spear money, annually to the Duke of Cornwall, who is Lord thereof, for free fishing with salmon-spears. The list or catalogue of the names of the Priors of this church is lost, except Thomas Vivian, the last save one;* a man famous in his days for his piety and charities, as his benefactions make him still me morable in ours ; for he built the rectory-house at Withall, the mansion-house at Ryalton, the south roof at Edleshayle church, and the lofty spire and steeple lately upon his prioral, now parochial church of Bod min aforesaid, which was all struck down with lightning and thunder anno Dom. 1699, and since again re-edified as it now stands, without a spire, at the proper cost and charge ofthe inhabitants of Bodmin town and parish. This Prior Vivian was by the Pope consecrated Bishop of Megara, in Achaia, a city of Greece. He lies en tombed with his bust or skeleton within a costly and curious stone chest or monument, about seven feet long, and three feet high above ground, on the top of which is cut at full length his portraiture as a man, and on this figurative body his episcopal robes, his mitre on his bead, his staff or crosier in his hand, his face encom passed over with the wings of two cherubim standing by : somewhat defaced in the interregnum of Cromwell, as a superstitious monument.

This church of the Prior's, after dissolution of the priory aforesaid, was converted to a parochial church for the parish and town of Bodmin, and the secular church of Beni left to fall into utter ruin and decay, as it now stands ; and is discontinued either for use of living or dead human creatures, the tower only standing, and cattle daily depasturing in the same, and the cemetery thereof, as in other places. Also this prioral rectory church, long before its disso lution, was converted by the Prior into a vicarage church ; for in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester before mentioned, anno Dom. 1294, Eccles. de Bodmin, in Decanatu de Trigg minor, was taxed to the Pope's annats vi/. xiiis.

This school Queen Elizabeth endowed with about 16Z. 13s. Ad. per annum revenues out of the Exchequer for ever. The name Bodmin anciently comprehended no more than the town or borough itself, as it is now taxed in the Exchequer; for in the Domesday tax Beni, Lan laran, now St. Lawrence, and Lantallan, were districts rated by themselves, though now consorted under that name of Bodmin parish and town. It is called a burge, or burghs, from the same Japhetical original as the Cornish word purguse, -n-vpyos [purgus], turris, a tower, castle, fenced or fortified place, from whence the Latins had their word burgus, of the same import; and suitable thereto, notable it is, this town hath in it still a place called Tower-hill ; as also, that every considerable town or burg in Cornwall heretofore had near it, for its de fence, some castle, tower, or citadel, to defend it from the invasion of enemies. And agreeably to this inter pretation and custom, Bodmin town, upon the east part thereof, upon a high-mounted hill, hath still extant the ruins and downfalls of a treble British entrench ment, containing above twelves acres of ground, for merly and still called Castle Kynock, alias Cunock, synonymous words, i. e. the King's, or the supreme and sovereign castle. (See Truro, Launceston, Saltash, Hels ton, &c. for the like.) Hence it is in the Cornish-British we have irvpyes, purges, Anglice burgess, or a citizen (from whence the Latins had their word burgensis), which signifies an in habitant of such a place as kept a tower, castle, fort, or hold, or had a college-court of purgesses (now burgesses) in it. And I doubt that, long before the Norman Con quest, or bishopric here was erected, this town of Bod-"], [122, "78 BODMIN. min by prescription was invested with the j urisdiction ol a court-leet, (id est,acourt that kept a law-day, or festival,) though the same was not confirmed by a charter or in- corporated before King John, A. D. 1216, granted one thereto; whereby he privileged the same with the tribu- nal also of a mayor, recorder, town clerk, twelve alder- men, and twenty-four common-councilmen, or assistants, who have power to nominate and elect a new mayor annually by the majority of voices, as also members of parliament. The mayor and town clerk, and last pre- ceding mayor, justices of the peace for one year after within the said borough ; the town clerk during life. This town and borough is held of the King of Great Britain, and pays annually to the King's Audit at Launceston between five and six pounds per annum rent, beyond the records of time. By the same charter it was made also one of the towns for coinage of tin, though long since discon tinued (see Lostwithiel for the Tinners' Charter) ; and made also the only staple town in Cornwall where in a public market merchants might carry their goods for wholesale, and whereby the mayor and town clerk also were authorized to take the acknowledge of statute sta ple bonds between party and party as the law directs.

It is also appurlenanced with fairs, upon January 25th, December 6th, Saturday after Mid-lent Sunday, and on Wednesday before Whit sun-day.

But, above all others, there is still extant in this town the stately church ofthe Franciscan Friars, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and their cells, consisting of one roof twenty clothyards high and fifty long, with two stone windows, admirable for height, breadth, and workman ship ; which, after the dissolution of their house and order by King Henry the Eighth, the justices of the peace of this county appointed for a house of correction for such vagrant and idle persons as the same afforded, by the name of the Friary and Shire-hall; which the townsmen taking notice of, soon after converted or pro faned it further to a common market- house, for selling corn, wool, and other commodities weekly ; yea, and within the same is kept yearly several fairs for selling all sorts of merchandize, the altars being pulled down, and in the churchyard, or burial-place, a fair for cattle."], [124, "80 BODMIN. It also lately made the tribunal or hall for the judges of assize yearly, and the justices of the peace in their ses sions, and is undoubtedly, except Westminster Hall, the fairest and best in England. The stone font of this church for baptizing infants is now converted to a measure for corn in this hall, which also, as I said, is the weekly market-house. On the same is an inscription in old characters, which I leave for abler capacities than mine to interpret. The founder of those Cordelier or Franciscan Friars was Francis of Assium, in Italy, who was born about the year 1140. His parents placed him to school for some time to study the liberal arts and sciences, and afterwards placed him to the trade and occupation of a merchant, which in Italy still, as anciently it was amongst the Jews, is so reputable an employment that even princes themselves are merchants : which trade or occupation Francis followed, with small gain or advan- tage, in a fair and righteous way, for some time, but growing discontented thereat, and not knowing thereby well how to subsist, he resolved, as others did, to follow indirect arts and practices to get more riches, by steal- ing the duties of such goods and merchandize as he bought and sold, which then was, and still is, a capital crime in Italy; and accordingly put the same in prac- tice, and much enriched himself thereby, though at length his fraud was detected, himself indicted, tried for his life, and condemned to death for the same. Where- upon, in order to prevent the sentence inflicted upon him, and to avoid the halter, he gave the greatest part ot his goods and estate to his prince, to grant or pro cure his pardon, and the other part to pious uses, in relieving the poor, and re-edifying and endowing three churches. Afterwards he fell into such great horror and trouble of conscience for those facts, and that he was fully informed from Hosea xii. 7 and 8, that a merchant cannot be without guile, nor a victualler with-"], [125, "81 BODMIN. out sin, it so wrought upon him, that he did not only renounce his trade of a merchant, but also forsook all worldly affairs, and took upon himself the vows of obe dience, poverty, and chastity ; and under the habit of a grey cover, or scapula, and a coat of the same, sur rounded or girded in the middle with a twisted rope, cord, or halter, in memory of his deliverance from it and the gallows, as aforesaid, with naked legs and discal ceated feet, he forsook his house, and went about tbe country preaching the Gospel gratis, subsisting only on the alms and charity of his hearers, and what was want ing in that particular was made up by downright beg gary. And in short time he so far prevailed with the people by his predicatements, that divers brethren went about with him, following the same manner of life, under the rules and habit aforesaid, which gave him occasion or opportunity to lay the foundation of the first convent in Christendom of his order at Assissium aforesaid, and obtained a confirmation of his rule from the Pope; and two years after his death, 4th Aug. 1228, was by him canonized for a saint. However, let it be remembered here, that afterwartls St. Bonaventure, being at the 18th year of his age en- tered of this order of St. Francis, and in the general chapter of Narbonne chosen minister general of those friars, he then so altered and regulated his rule and order, or rather reformed it, that ever since it might more aptly be called the order of St. Bonaventure than that of St. Francis. Which St. Bonaventure afterwards being made a Bishop, and one of the Cardinals of Rome, wrote the Life of St. Francis in Latin, and there- in recounted so many stories of his conversion as afore- said, of his perfection, religion, reparation of three churches, his sincere, mortified life, and the manner of preparing creatures for his refection, his humility, obe dience, condescension, and bowing downwards of him self, his love of poverty, the wonderful supply of his"], [126, "82 BODMIN. wants, his affections towards piety, his desire of martyr dom, his study, and virtuous orations, his skill in Scrip ture and spirit of prophecy, bis efficacious predicate ments, his sacred marks, and holy chastisements of his body, his patience in undergoing the pangs of death, 4th Oct. 1226, that in this place I have only room to name them. And as a surplusage thereto, St. Bonaven ture, as also Alosi Lepomani, Bishop of Seville, ascribe to St. Francis, before and after his death, the doing of no less than 113 miracles, or supernatural acts, which, I think, are more than are recorded by the sacred writ ings to be done by our Saviour Jesus. But, notwithstanding all that is done and said by St. Bonaventure in praise of St. Francis, he did not much rely upon the merit of him or any other Saint, since it is an established sanction at the end of all his hymns pertaining to this order of Franciscans, Soli gloria tibi, Domine, qui natus es de Virgine. Now though this Order of St. Francis, after convents were erected and endowed, for the most part lived in convents under these rules as aforesaid, without alms or begging, yet a particular sort of them went abroad to preach the Gospel in parochial churches and free cha pels, where the rector, vicar, curate, or chaplain was no preacher, and administered the sacraments as occasion required; having, moreover, committed to their charge or jurisdiction, by the Pope, the commutation of penance lor sins committed ; and, because by their rule they were not to take money, they took the same in corn, wool, fruits, fields, goods, and chattels, for their Superior. Those kind of missionaries were called Friars Observants, and went at large as supervisors, who pretended to a stricter observation of their rule than the master con ventuals that went not abroad. What revenues this stately church of St. Francis at Bodmin had at its disso lution I know not, neither doth the Monasticon Angli canum inform me ; besides five quarterly pence, and"], [127, "83 BODMIN. twenty pence by the year out of every family or dwel ling-house in Cornwall, that was not excused propter paupertatem. Supplication of Beggars to Henry the Eighth, p. 2. Those Franciscan friars, Mendicant or Minors, came not into England till Henry the Third's days (since which time this church at Bodmin must be erected) in all but nine in number, who landed at Dover; five of which went to Canterbury, where, by the King's leave, they built the first convent in England of their order; four went to London, and had a place given them in St. Nicholas Shambles, anno Dom. 1260, to erect another convent or monastery, by John Jewyn, merchant. However, let it be remembered that the Black Friars Mendicant, or Augustines, were founded by William de Paris, and first brought into England in the time of William the Conqueror, to whom Robert Kilwarby, Archbishop of Canterbury tempore Wil- liam I. at the west end of London, on the bank of the Thames, founded and endowed there a monastery to them. For White Friars, or Cistersians, see Kilkhamp- ton ; for Dominicans, St. Dominick. Carmelite Friars were founded at Carmellus, a town in Syria; as also a latter order of those discalceated friars were founded by St. Mary de Theresa, of Jesus, of the blessed Lady of Mount Carmel, 1540. She was a native of Castile, and died 4th October, 1582, in the 68th year of her age, and 47th of being religious. She was canonized by Pope Gregory XV. 12th March 1622. The Friars of St. Francis of Paula, in Italy, were founded by him 1414; little different from those others. Finally of these friars : Bishop Fisher, in his Discourse of the Primitive Church, fully demonstrates that, before the Reformation of reli gion, besides monks there were in this land, of the five orders, above thirty thousand begging friars.

He was the son of Mounts or Stephens, alias Mountstephen, of St. Mabyn, and had his first educa tion under Mr. Stephens, sometime schoolmaster of Bod min, to whom at length he became usher; afterwards was clerk or servitor to William Lilly, Esq. and so be came an undergraduate in Oxford; and, being recom mended by him to the notice of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord President ofthe Council temp. James II. he made him one of his clerks or secretaries, which circumstance further brought him to the knowledge of Jonathan Lord Bishop of Bristol, by whose interest he obtained a bur gess-ship at West Looe for the parliament, and was afterwards made one of the Commissioners for the King's Tin-farm in those parts ; by which ways and means he got himself considerable wealth and reputation. But, notwithstanding all those his prosperous suc cesses of fortune, in the month of December, or begin ning of January, 1706, aged about 60 years, when he was at London, a member of parliament as aforesaid, and in his own house till eleven of the clock, one day upon some discontent went from his company, and so into a more retired apartment, where he took a razor and cut his own throat, and instantly fell dead on the spot, the razor by his side all bloody, to the great terror and amaze ment of his domestics, who found him in that posture. Various were the reports and sayings of people upon occasion of this sad accident ; some said it was for that he made addresses of marriage to a gentlewoman above his degree, who rejected his amours, upon account of some concubine, or bedfellow, he kept at Truro; others, with more probability, gave out that he was detected by the Earl of Sunderland (who raised him) for eighteen years' space to have been a French pensioner, and to have"], [129, "BODMIN. 85 received a great sum of money annually for communi cating the secrets of the Queen and Parliament to the Secretary of the French King, which as soon as he un derstood, by a letter shown him under his own hand, he instantly went home to his lodgings, burnt all his papers, and committed the felo-de-se aforesaid.

Again, this family indifferently wrote their name Flam-mank, Flam-manc, id est, in Cornish, flaming or burning glove, sleeve, or gauntlet; so called, perhaps, for that some of this family was a notable soldier, and famous in the combat at sword and gauntlet, (viz. mili tary glove,) or a sleeve and gorget of mail, as the above name. And flammock may relate to some soldier of this tribe that was as renowned in his charge with the fusee or firelock, soon after the invention of guns : for Cam den, in his Remains, tells us that in Edward the Third's French wars gunaria, or gunarii, had its pay ; which was before the invention of guns in Germany. But if flammeck, flammeg, flammock, be a monosvl lable, and not a compound or conjugated word, it sig nifies in British blear-eyed-ness, or one that hath a sparkling or flaming eye, either by natural or accidental infirmity, an obstruction of sight.

(Carew's Survey,) that were held by the tenure of knight's service, and was no knight ; who was obliged by his tenure to send into the King's army a man and horse armed with lorica, capello ferri, gladio, et cultello, a breastplate, a brigandine, an iron headpiece, a sword and cuttler. As was also that Thomas Flammock, a lawyer, in the reign of King Henry VII. 1496, who, together with Michael Joseph, a smith of these parts, stirred up the Cornish people to a rebellion against that prince, under the pretence ofthe severity of a land tax, though it was but a subsidy of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds, charged by Act of Parliament for one year of the thirty-seven shires of England, towards the Scotch war; which, after the severest imposition, could not amount to above 2,500/. on this county. But really the ground and design of this insurrection was to depose King Henry from his crown and dignity, and in his stead to set up Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, the true heir male of the House of York, sister's son to King Edward the Fourth. Which being well understood by the inhabitants of Cornwall, gave Flammock and Joseph opportunity to raise such an army, as thereby to become so formidable that John Basset, of Tehidy, then Sheriff, with his posse comitatus, dared not encounter them. Whereupon they marched with their army, consisting of about six thousand men, from Bodmin to Launceston, and from thence into Devon; where also they appeared so tremendous that Sir William Carew, Knight, then She riff thereof, with his posse comitatus, would not venture a battle with them, but suffered them (either through fear or aiffection) to pass through his Bailiwick into Somer setshire, and so Taunton there; ia which place they slew the Provost Perrin, a commissioner for the subsidy aforesaid, and then advanced to Wells; where James Touchet, Lord Audley, knowing the mystery of their"], [131, "87 BODMIN. Sjdesigi^wnqnfetterated with them, and became their ge- ito|&1. Soon after, they published their declaration of pretended grievances, cbiefty concerning the said land tax, and wholly laying the blame of that exaction upon John Martin, Archbishop ot' Canterbury, ancl Reginald Bray, Knt. two of the King's Council, whom they would have removed from that station. Upon which pretence (and the secret reserve aforesaid) the people, being better affected to the House of York than to that of Lancaster, suffered these rebels quietly to march from Wells to Salisbury, from Salisbury to Winchester, and from thence into Kent, where they ex- pected great aid and assistance; but when they came there, contrary to promise and to expectation, no person came to their help : but on the contrary, for the King there appeared in arms against them, with the Earl of Kint, the Lord Abergavenny, Sir John Brook, Lord Cob- ham, and divers other gentlemen, with great forces, to stop their further proceedings that way. Upon which disappointment, the rebels turned their march towards London, and encamped upon Blackheath, about four miles from thence ; where they had not long been before they were encountered by Giles Lord Daubeny, King Henry's general, who, after a short conflict with them, and the loss of three hundred soldiers on the King's part, and two thousand on the Rebels' side, the re- mainder of them fell into despair, threw down their arms, craved mercy, and yielded themselves prisoners. The King pardoned many; but of the chief authors of the insurrection none. The Lord Audley was committed to Newgate, and from thence drawn to Tower-hill in his coat-armour (painted on paper), reversed and torn, where he was beheaded. Flammock and Michael Josepp the smith, were hanged, drawn, and quartered, and has their heads and quarters pitched upon stakes set up in London and other places, June 26, 1496.

An opi-"], [132, "88 BODMIN. nion is still prevalent in Cornwall, that after themselves the people of Kent are the most brave in England.] This town and parish of Bodmin is also notable for the rendezvous of Perkin Warbeck's army from St. Michell's Mount, which he had also raised to the num ber of six thousand in opposition to King Henry the Seventh, anno Dom. 1498, as the pretended Richard of Shrewsbury, second son to King Edward the Fourth ; where he was proclaimed King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, by the name of Richard the Fourth : but he and his army at length underwent the same fate as the former rebels did. (See St. Michael's Mount, in this our History.) Here also was the rendezvous of the Cornish rebels under Humphrey Arundell, Esq. anno 3 Edward VI. who pitched their camp upon Castle Kynock aforesaid, and imprisoned such gentlemen as would not willingly ride with them, till the King's forces vanquished the one, and delivered the other, at and near Exeter. (See St. Hillary.) Now Sir Anthony Kingston, Provost Martial of the King's Army, coming from Exeter to do justice in Corn wall according to the law of arms against such rebels as had escaped thence, executed Thomas Boyeer, the mayor of this town, and the miller's man, is set forth in Mr. Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 124 (p. 292 of Lord Dunstanville's Edition). In this parish is St. Laurence, so called from the cha pel dedicated to his guardianship. The name is derived from the Latin words, laureat and ensis, that is, a lau reat sword, or a sword of triumph. St. Laurence was a native of Osca, in Spain, born about the year 280. He received holy orders from St. Xysten, who was raised to the chair of St. Peter in 257. During the persecution by the Emperor Valerian, St. Laurence, finding that notj even the sacred vestments nor the decorations of the church, were safe from profane hands, availed him-"], [133, "89 BODMIN. self of the office of chief deacon, which he then held, to dispose of the whole, and to distribute the wealth thus acquired among the indigent of his spiritual brethren. This having been made known to the Prefect of Rome, a man devoted to the worship of false gods, but more, as the biographer observes, to the adoration of silver and gold, he demanded from St. Laurence the riches of the church, who promised in three days to produce them ; and on the third day he returned with the poor persons among whom their value had been divided. When the Prefect, transported with rage, is said to have ordered his destruction by the most cruel death. The legend reports him to have been fastened on an iron bed, and consumed by fire placed under it. Hence the familiar emblem attributed to this martyr, of a gridiron. The event is referred to the 10th of Aug. 261. In this parish the town, or rather village of St. Lau rence, is situated between two hills, and with a pleasant river running through its street, about a mile and a half west from Bodmin. In it stands a lawres hospital, that is to say, a hospital for lepers (loure, or lower, in British is a leper), which hath good endowment of lands and revenues appertaining thereto, founded by the piety and charity ofthe well-disposed people of this county in for mer ages, for the relief, support, and maintenance of all such people as should be visited with that sickness called elphantiasy, in Latin lepra or elphantia, in English leprosy, in British lowerery ; being a white in fectious scurf running all over the bodies of such per sons as are tainted therewith. Which disease heretofore in many families was hereditary, and infected the blood for generations. This disease, though common in Asia, was thought to have been first brought into England from Egypt by seamen and traders, so that generally it spread itself over this kingdom about the year 1100. Soon after"], [134, "90 BODMIN. which, a general collection of charitable benevolences was gathered throughout the land by one of the Mow brays, a gentleman tainted with the disease, for erecting and endowing the lazar-house or hospital of Burton, in Leicestershire, to which place was made subject all other hospitals of this sort in England, as the Master of Burton Hospital was afterwards made subject to the Master of St. John's Hospital of Jerusalem, in London, and then, soon after the erection of lazar-houses through out this kingdom, was invented that writ called Leproso amovendo, for removing a leper from his country-house to the hospital. But the custom in this place was such, that none were to be admitted by the governors of the same for the time being, unless the person so brought in paid them 5c?. a pot for dressing their meat, a purse and a penny in it to receive alms. At present 1 hear of no lepers in this hospital, nor any person visited with this disease in Cornwall : however, daily in the chapel of Lawrence, by the townspeople, God is duly worshipped by a chaplain in deacon's orders, who reads divine ser vice to them according to the church of England; and at three several times at least in the year the Vicar of Bodmin, and Rector of Lannerat, for a small stipend preach and administer the sacraments to them. Infants baptized, and the dead bodies thereof buried, at Bodmin church. The lands, customs, and privileges of this lazar-house, or lower hospital, were much augmented or enlarged, and also confirmed by a charter from Queen Elizabeth, in the beginning of her reign, with the jurisdiction of a court-leet within the precincts of its manor of Ponteby, (id est, by the ford or bridge whereon the town of St. Lawrence is situate,) the white-rod erected or held up yearly whilst the court is sitting. It is also by that charter privileged with a weekly market, to be kept on Wednesday, within the town of St. Lawrence, though of"], [135, "91 BODMIN. late discontinued ; as also with fairs yearly on the 10th of August and the 18th of October. TONKIN. In respect to the etymology of the name Bodmin, or or Bodman, I have no difficulty. I looke upon the word as Saxon-Kernaiwsh, bode and man, or bode-men in the plural, which may safely, and without a catachr\u00e6sis, be interpreted, the preacher-man, or men. That bode sig nifies priest, or preacher, in the Cornish, the Gaelic, and other cognate tongues, I confirm by the authority of Alfred, the Saxon grammarian, and of Verstegan, from which is derived our modern Kernawish word for a priest. And this sense is preserved in the names of divers other churches throughout the land; as in the hundred of Weston, Herefordshire, where we find Boddenham Vicarage, bod -den -ham, preacher- man -dwelling, den being in Kernawish synonymous with man. [The remainder of Mr. Tonkin's narrative agrees so nearly with that of Mr. Hals as not to require its in sertion.] WHITAKER. \" The paroch chirch standith at the est end of the town, and is a fair large thyng,\" says Leland, an author with whom Mr. Hals had no acquaintance (though the Itinerary of that author was published in 1710, and in some years immediately following ; and the Collectanea in 1715); \"there is a cantuarie chapel at th' est ende of it.\" This is the present school, situated a few yards east of the eastern end, raised upon vaults, ascended by steps, entered by an arched door of stone peaked, * This establishment having completely degenerated, and become a mere re ceptacle for persons of the very worst description, the charter was, about twenty years ago, declared forfeited; and the revenues have been attached to the county hospital, reserving a preference for lepers over all other patients, if any such should present themselves."], [136, "92 BODMIN. having a large arched window peaked; at the east two windows in the arch, two on the south, arched and peaked; with three stalls of stone on the south, near the eastern end. The space below, lately a bone-house to the church, now atttached to the school, must formerly have been a walk under the vault. \" Bodmyn hath a market on every Saturday, lyke a fair for the confluence of people.\" (Itin. ii. 114.) Bodmin was then at the height of its glory : it began soon afterwards to sink. The many decayed houses, says Carew, 120 years afterwards, prove the town to have been once very populous. What occasioned this decay was the Reformation, probably, throwing the revenues of the priory, and of the house of friars, into the hands of men laical and distant. \"There was a good place of Gray Freres in the south syde of Bodmin town. One John of London, a mer chaunt, was the beginner of this house. Edmund Erie of Cornewaul augmentid it. There lay buried in the Gray Freres Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas Peverel, Knightes, and benefactors to the house.\" \u2014 (Leland.) The remains of this form the south side of an open space, which must have been the quadrangle or court of the Friars, and have been surrounded by its buildings, on the east, the north, and the west. On the west end, near the grand door in these remains, was the church-yard, or burying-place, which Mr. Hals says was made a fair for cattle ; and here were very lately found, by sinking a saw-pit, bones in a considerable quantity. The remains themselves are, a long and lofty room once a church, but since used as Mr. Hals describes! It has a fine window at the east end, peaked in the arch the only part of it that is not blocked up being very pleasingly broken into small parts by mullions of stone. It has another arch for a window to the west, but not so fine; and four arches on the north and south sides, all peaked, but those most easterly more sharply"], [137, "BODMIN. 93 than the others. What Mr. Hals calls a font is still there; and a font it assuredly is, the Friars having just as much right to a font as to a burying-place; but the inscription upon it is on two or three squares of the hexagon in which the font is shaped, and is too modern to mean any thing. \" There is a chapel of St. at the west ende of the toune. There is another chapel in Bodmyn beside that at the west ende of the toune, and an almose house, but not endowid with landes.\" (Leland, Itin. ii. 114, 115.) Query, says Tanner, respecting the latter, Whether this alms-house was St. Anthony's or St. George's? for the will of John Killigrew, proved A.D. 1500, gives legacies Pauperibus Sancti Antonii de Bod myn, et Pauperibus Sancti Georgii de Bodmyn. Both these chapels had an almshouse. The latter is that chapel which stood on the summit of a hill north of Bodmin, called Berry, from some castle or fort upon it, I suppose, and giving name to the valley below it, Berrycoomb, or Bereum. The remains of this chapel are merely a tower, neat but slight, making a consider able object to the road from its elevation, yet small in its rise, or its pitch, and carrying a face of no great an tiquity, being merely three hundred years old. The town, says tradition, stood formerly here, was burnt down, and then removed to its present site. That this is false as history we know for certain, as we know the town to have been where it now stands, but that the town in the days of its high prosperity had shot out hither. \" The showe and the principale of the toun of Bod myn,\" says Leland, \" is from west to est along in one streate.\" (Itin.ii. 114.) There were (says Mr. Hals upon the credit of information) within these sixty years past no less than thirteen churches, or free chapels, remaining either whole or ruined in the town and parish, and this was one."], [138, "94 BODMIN. The church of the priory, notes Mr. Hals, after the dissolution of religious houses, was converted to a paro chial church. It was, indeed, such from the beginning : so Leland tells us concerning it in his time, \" that the parish church standeth at the east end of the town,\" &c. It was even converted as such from a rectorial to a vica rial church before 1290. This prioral rectory church, Mr. Hals himself informs us, (long before the dissolution, and therefore not after the dissolution of the priory, as said before,) was con verted by the Prior into a vicarage church ; for in the Inquisitions of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, Ecclesia de Bod man was rated to the Pope's annats at 61. 13s. Ad. Vicar, ejusdem nihil propter paupertatem. So directly does Mr. Hals confute himself; but the words of the record are not cited fairly, and are in reality these: Ecclesia de Bodmynia vi/. xiiis. Ad. Vicar, ejusdem xis. Nor could any one of the thirteen be a free chapel, as no such chapels existed in the first or in the second valuation, and therefore none are mentioned therein. Vivian's \" tomb is adorned round with crosses.\" In truth, it has only one, and that is upon the northern side. '' The arms of his Bishopric of Megara,\" the arms of this Priory, and lastly, \" those of his own or of his an cestors.\" But there are three fishes repeated as arms twice; and Mr. Hals affirms himself that the jurisdic tion and royalty over the river Alan, from Camelford to Padstow Rock, was given to this Priory. by Algar Earl of Cornwall; and in further testimony of Algar's dona tion of tbe royalty of this river, he gave for the perpetual arms of him and his priory, In a field Azure, three salmon-fishes in fess barwise Argent ; which arms were lately extant in all the church windows of the churches under the priory. Castle Kynock, as called by some to this day, but called simply the Castle by the generality, lies more than half"], [139, "95 BODMIN. a mile to the south-west, has two ditches and two ram parts ; the outer are very deep and very massy, the inner are much shallower and slighter. It takes in the whole crest of the hill, the ground within rising from the sides to the summit ; is circular in form, because the hill is so ; and has its only entrance on the east, denoted as an original entrance by the bridge of earth, as it were, which leads across the hollow of the ditches into it. The whole is double, I believe, to the extent that Mr. Hals gives it; and, from the position ofthe entrance on the east, appears to be Roman in its origin. THE EDITOR. It is not my intention to enter on any discussion rela tive to the remote and obscure antiquity of Bodmin. Tanner, in his Notitia Monasticon, says Bodmin, or Bodmanna. There was a church built here to the memory of St. Petroc, a religious man born in Wales, but who, coining from Ireland, is said to have built a monastery on the north coast of Cornwall, about A. D. 520, and to have been there buried; but. his body being afterwards re- moved to Bodmin, a church was built to his memory, and the episcopal see for Cornwall was believed to have been therein placed by King Edward the Elder and Archbishop Plegmund, A. D. 705. Here King \u00c6thel- stan is reported to have met with old Saxon, or rather British, monks following the Rule of St. Benedict, to whom he granted so great privileges and endowments that he is accounted founder of the monastery here, about A.D. 926. That settlement was destroyed by the Danish pirates, A.D. 981 ; yet the religious continued here under several shapes, and much alienation of their lands, both before and after the Conquest, till about the year 1120, when Earl Algar, with the King's license, and the consent of William Warlewach, Bishop of Exeter, re-established this religious-house, and placed"], [140, "96 BODMIN. therein regular canons of the Order of St. Austin, who continued till the general suppression, when it was styled the Priory of St. Mary and St. Petroc, and was valued at 270/. per annum according to Dugdale, and 289/. 12s. according to Speed. The site, with the demesnes, were granted, 36th of Henry VIII. to Thomas Sternhold, one of tbe first translators of the Psalms into English metre. Any one desirous of learning all that can be known or conjectured respecting the Western Bishopric, is re ferred to \" The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall histori cally surveyed,\" by the \"Rev. John Whitaker ; where that subject and various others are discussed, with the eloquence, ability, erudition, and confidence, usually displayed by that eminent writer ; who appears always to assume throughout the whole of his work the very ques tionable fact, that monastic historians, distant both in time and in space from the events which they relate, are possessed of perfect information, and that their narra tives flow with unerring accuracy, at a period when none ofthe inventions for rapidly carrying intelligence, and for stamping it with the authentic impression of public notoriety, had yet occurred to the human mind. I willingly leave these recondite, and, in truth, little interesting researches, for others of a more modern date, the objects of which are still extant, and their effects in fluencing the present times. Those connected with Bod min we owe, in a great measure, to the ability, the in dustry, and the laudable zeal of Mr. John Wallis, the present vicar, on whom I would readily bestow more praise, if his merits had not rendered commendation from me superfluous. One event, however, intermediate between the Saxon antiquities of Bodmin and those disclosed by Mr. Wal lis, is so very curious, and so illustrative of opinions and of habits long passed away, that I cannot help inserting the details of it from Benedictus Abbas, an author of high reputation, Abbot of the great monastery of St."], [141, "97 BODMIN.

Flying with it, he passed beyond the seas, and carried the body to the Abbey of Saint Mevennus, in Lesser Britany. \" When this transaction became known to Roger the Prior of Bodmin, and to the Canons who served God in the same place, the aforesaid Prior, with the advice of his brethren, went to Henry King of England, son of the Empress Matilda, that by his powerful aid they might again get possession of the body of St. Petroc, of which they had been fraudulently deprived. The King granted his aid to their entreaty, and by his letters com manded Rollandus de Dinamnus, the Justiciary of Bri tanny, that, without any delay, he should cause the body to be restored. When, therefore, Rollandus had received the King's command, he came with a powerful and armed band to the Abbey of St. Mevennus, and ordered that the body should be given up; and when the * A similar account of this curious affair is given by Hoveden, another con temporary author, who continued the history of England from the year 731, where that of Bede ceases, to 1202, the fourth year of King John.

Abbat and the Monks were unwilling to comply, he added threats, that, unless the body were yielded imme diately, he would use force and take it; which when thev heard, they feared to incur the displeasure of tho King of England, and therefore restored that blessed body to the before-named Roger, Prior of Bodmin, on the Lord's Day (Clausi Pentecostes), being the feast of St. Gervasius and of St. Prothasius, martyrs, the thir teenth before the calends of July (June the 19th). And that sacred body was restored in all its integrity, with out the least diminution ; the Abbat and Monks of St. Mevennus having sworn on the relics belonging to their church that they had not retained any part of the body, but had restored it wholly unaltered. \" When this was done, the before-named Prior of Bodmin, returning with joy into England, brought the body of tbe blessed Petroc, closed in an ivory case, to the City of Winchester. And when it was brought into the King's presence, the King, having seen and adored it, permitted the Prior to return in peace with his Saint charge to the Abbey of Bodmin.\" It would appear that such depredations must have frequently occurred, since one precisely similar, but not followed by a restoration of the relics, took place in the neighbouring monastery of St. Neot. In this case, the stolen body of the Saint, having been enshrined at Eynesbury, in Huntingdonshire, bestowed his name as a new appellation to the place. See \" A Description, accompanied by sixteen coloured plates, of the Church of St. Neot, in Cornwall,\" by J. P. Hedgeiand, 1 vol. 4to. 1830, with Illustrations by Davies Gilbert. Mr. Wallis has collected a very great variety of curious and interesting particulars respecting this town and parish, and given them to the public in a work en titled, \"The Bodmin Register ; or, Collections relative to the past and present State ofthe Parish of Bodmin.\" And, in doing so, he has proved that tbe antiquities of a h 2"], [144, "100 BODMIN. county cannot in any way be illustrated, except by the exertions of individuals locally residing in the district to which their attentions are directed, and that from zeal and ability in such persons every thing may be expected. The following are extracts from this publication: The benefice is a vicarage in the gift of Lord de Dun stanville, situated in the Deanery of Trigg Minor, and in the hundred of Trigg. The following are the dimen sions of the church: length 151 feet, breadth 63 feet. The greater part was built in the reign of King Edward the Fourth. It was roofed in 1472, as appears by an inscription on the cornice on the northern side of the south aile of the chancel. The northern chancel and the tower appear to be of an earlier date. The walls of the tower are eight feet thick at the base, made for the support of a lofty spire, which was destroyed by light ning, between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday even ing, December the\" 9th, 1699- The present awkward pinnacles were then erected : three of them are danger ous from the decay of the stone. The ancient building in the church-yard, adjoining to the vicarage-house, was, it is believed, a chantry chapel dedicated to St. Thomas. The interior, 44 feet 9 inches by 19 feet, was used till lately for the free grammar school. It is now converted to a national school for girls. Under is a crypt or bone-house. The isolated tower at Berry, on the north of the town, belonged to the chapel of the Holy Rood. The build ing of this tower was commenced on the 12th of Sep tember, 17th of King Henry VII. 1501. Since the year 1814, both the church and church-yard, which were in a very ruinous and neglected state, have been greatly altered and improved. Over the porch are the remains of two small rooms, each about eleven feet square, formerly the record and the council rooms ofthe corporation. The floor of the higher one, the record room, gave way about eighty"], [145, "101 BODMIN. years ago, as some gentlemen were inspecting the docu ments. In the lower room some valuable records had remained for a long time neglected, till in the year 1807 or 1808 they were removed to the guild-hall, and there examined and arranged. They contain many curious particulars relative to the history of the parish, and in cidentally of the county, during a period of five hun dred years, the oldest document bearing date in the 14th Edward II. (1320). Among them is a charter of the 36th Edward III. (1362) ; another, in good preservation, of the 3d year of Richard II. ( 1380), having reference to the reigns of Henry tbe First and Second. A minute of the receipts and payments for the rebuilding of the church, in the years 1469, 1470, and 1471 ; and also for the erection of Berry Tower, in 1501 ; the contract with Matthy More, carpenter, for making the pulpit and open seats throughout the church in 1491, the carved remains of which are at present much admired; Resolu tions of the Corporation on the destruction of the spire in 1699; also a Petition to King Henry the Eighth, on the eve of the Reformation, conveying some ludicrous charges against the Prior; with various others. In the north chancel is the altar-tomb of Prior Vivian, the inscription on which has been inserted in page 76. The tomb was repaired, and placed between two pillars ofthe chancel, in 1819, by the late Sir Vyell Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. The very splendid organ was given, in the year 1775, by Mr. James Laroche and Mr. George Hunt, at that time Members for the town. Mr. Wallis enters into a very minute detail of parti culars highly interesting to the immediate neighbour hood, but which would occupy too much space in a general parochial history of Cornwall. The carving in the church is indeed greatly admired, but a large part of that admiration is excited by the appropriate and judicious manner in which it has been rendered ornamental by the present vicar."], [146, "102 BODMIN. The inscriptions on various monuments are noticed bv Lysons, and other writers. But a splendid addition has been recently made to the decorations of the church by Lord De Dunstan ville, on his retiring from the office of recorder in tbe corporation. The large east window of the chancel is entirely filled with painted glass, and the middle part contains a well-drawn representation ofthe Ascension. Bodmin parish contains 5279 statute acres.

Dr. Boase says of the Geology : the town of Bodmin is about midway between two insulated groups of gra nite, and it is principally built of a stone quarried on the spot, and which well deserves the attention of geo logists. This rock in the deeper parts of the quarry becomes more blue ; but its common appearance pre sents various shades of drab or fawn colour, with irre gular spots of an ochreous yellow. It breaks into thick lamin\u00e6, or slabs, which are traversed by parallel joints; so that, with care, this stone may be obtained in oblong quadrangular masses. It is soft; sometimes so much so as to lose its cohesion. The substance appears to be almost entirely argillaceous."], [147, "103 BODMIN. All the cultivated parts of this parish, north and north-west of the town, rest on this rock : and the barren parts on a schistose rock, which is very siliceous, afford ing by its partial disintegration no more than a shallow, meagre soil; silica predominating in the one, and ar gillaceous earth, or alumine, in the other. The charac teristic rocks of these genera occur next to the granite in the parishes of Blisland and St. Breward, and they will be noticed in the description of the latter parish. The editor is aware that the article Bodmin has ex tended to a very great length. It might easily have been extended much further from interesting materials collected by Mr. W allis relative to the past and present state of this chief seat of our ecclesiastical establish ments. On their abolition the town unquestionably fell into great decay, till about the middle of the last cen tury, when roads were made in all directions, and Bod min, from being almost inaccessible by the modern sys tem of travelling, became an extensive thoroughfare ; the market has grown into one of the first in Cornwall, and the whole town is renovated by trade and industry. If any further apology is required, the editor hopes that he may be excused for some partiality towards a place which he has represented in eight successive Par liaments, after as many unanimous elections. BOTUSFLEM1NG. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north, Pillaton ; south, Salt-Ash, and part of St. Stephen's ; east, Landulph ; west, Landrake. For the first name, it signifies \" Flemings' Parish ;\" for bio, bleau, pleu, in Cornish, is of that signification (viz. a parish);"], [148, "104 BOTUSFLEMING. for the second name, it signifies \" Flemings,\" making amends, or supplying defects (see Verstegan on the word Bote), and seems from the name to be a church founded or endowed by some gentlemen of that name, in order for the commutation of penance for sins committed, and to pray for the founder's soul, his ancestors, and rela tives ; by which expedients most religious houses and churches heretofore were built. Originally these Flem ings came from Stoke Fleming in Devon, so called, for that once a nobleman of Flanders resided there, and was lord thereof: one of whose posterity, tempore Richard I. in this place, held by the tenure of knight's service seven knights' fees, by tbe name of Stephen Flandrensis (Ca rew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 48), who probably was the founder of this church, still bearing his name. His son Richard Flandrensis was sheriff\" of Cornwall three years, from the third to the sixth year of King John's reign. Finally, the estate, name, and blood of those Flemings, tempore Henry IV. ended in a daughter and heir, which was married to John Coplestone, of Coplestone, in the county of Devon. This district of Bote-Fleming, at the time of the Norman Conquest, was rated under the name of Pilla ton, still contiguous therewith. But at the time of the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester into the value of benefices in Cornwall 1294, in order to the Pope's annats, Ecclesia de Bote-ffleminen in Deca natu de Est AVellshire, was rated iiis. iiiitZ.

Mutten-ham, id est, the Mutton dwelling or habi tation, alias Mott-an-ham, the meeting or court dwelling, in the year 1689 was the dwelling of my kind friend John Waddon, Esq. (a justice of peace and deputy- governor of Pendennis Castle for King James, under John Earl of Bath); in which house and place his lordship first treated with the Prince of Orange's Commissioners, in order to render into his possession the"], [149, "105 BOTUSFLEMING. castles of Pendennis and Plymouth, which soon after was performed, on condition of the Earl's holding his former dominion as governor of those places under him ; whereupon he caused the Prince's declarations to be first proclaimed or published in those garrisons amongst the soldiers; who received and heard the same with great joy, shouts, and acclamations, to the utter destruction of King James's jurisdiction and power in Cornwall and Devon, and establishing that prince's. At this time were dispersed those rhymes, said to be made by father Peters : ** Henricus Octavus Sold the land that God gave us ; But Jacobus Secundus Shall refund us.\" The dispersion of which two papers, made all posses sors of church lands and impropriators, together with all rectors and vicars of churches in Cornwall (except Mr. Beauford of Lantegles, and Mr. Polwhele of New land,) to renounce their allegiance to King James, and to take an oath of fealty to the Prince of Orange, after his accession to the crown of England. TONKIN. I shall take leave to add this interpretation of the words making up the name of this parish. Bote signifies help, succour, aid, or advantage; as in Bridgebote, Burgbote, Ploughbote, &c. ; and Fleming, from its ancient lords the Flemings, which family was heretofore of good es teem in this county. In the times of Richard I. and of Henry III., the Flemings are recorded as having large possessions in Cornwall. the editor. The following very extraordinary occurrence has taken place with respect to the estate of Hatt in this parish. A brother of the last Mr. William Symons went through his clerkship as an attorney with Mr. Rash-"], [150, "106 BOTUSFLEMING. leigh at St. Austell. He there formed an attachment to a respectable young woman, but in a situation of life so much inferior to his own as to excite a violent opposi tion against this marriage on the part of his friends. In consequence Mr. Symonds suddenly disappeared ; no trace could be discovered, nor was any information re ceived about him, either by his relations or by the de serted object of his affection. The elder brother died unmarried, and his sisters or their families took possession of his property ; till, about forty years after Mr. Symonds had left Cornwall, a young man claimed the whole as his eldest son, and finally sub- stantiated his claim by the verdict of a jury, and to the entire satisfaction of a full court. His father had dis- appeared about the year 1780; he had employed him- self in various humble, but not disreputable occupa- tions, married, and finally settled in Liverpool, where he was accidentally drowned. His family then first acquired, from inspecting his papers, any knowledge of Cornwall, or of the stock from whence they were de rived ; they found his articles of clerkship, with various letters and documents, which placed his identity beyond all doubt, and the son now possesses the manor house, with a fair private gentleman's estate.

HALS. Boyton is situate in the hundred of Stratton, and hath upon the east the Tamer River, south Warrington, north Tamerton, west North Pedyrwyn, and as a mark of its antiquity and grandeur it was taxed in the Domesday Roll 1067 or 1087, by the present name. In the Inqui sition of the Bishop of Lincoln and Winchester before mentioned, Capella de Boyeton, in Decanatu de Stra tone, was rated xxxs. but whether rectory or vicarage I am ignorant; the same not being mentioned either in Wolsey's Inquisition or Valor Beneficioruin. The pa- tronage in The incumbent This parish rated to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1696, =\u00a389. 14s. Most probable it seems to me, that this place was de- nominated Boyton in memory of a colony of the Boii Gauls, that out of that country of Gaul first planted themselves here ; who were a people on the further side of the Rhine, that with the Helvetians first invaded Gaul, as C\u00e6sar informs us, and placed themselves amongst the Hedui, a people of Galba Celtica, near the Loire River, and possessed a great part of Burgundy ; C\u00e6sar also makes Boia in Gaul the name of a town. Bradridge in this parish, the broad ridge or far- row of land (Saxon), is the dwelling of John Hoblyn, Esq. barrister at law, son of Mr. Hoblyn, attorney at law, of Bodmin ; which place came to this gentleman by marriage with the sole daughter and heir of William Symons, Gent, attorney at law, as it did to him by mar- riage with the daughter and heir of Heale. The Heales' arms are, Party per fess Argent and Sable, a pole counterchanged with three trefoils, one on each side the pole in chief, and the other thereon, in base counterchanged."], [152, "108 BOYTON. At Northcott, in this parish, temp. Queen Mary, lived Agnes Prest, but where born, or what her maiden name was, is to me unknown, whose merit challengeth to be recorded in this place, as being the only martyr that suffered death for the Protestant religion iii the diocese of Exon during the said Queen's reign. She is described by Holinshed, Howell, alias Hooker, and by Fuller from them, to be a contemptible woman in respect of her person, (as St. Paul was for a man,) little, and short of stature, and of a brownish complexion. She was in dicted, as Mr. Vowell says, at Launceston, in this county, upon Monday tbe fourth week in Lent, the 2d and 3d of Philip and Mary, before the Grand Jury there assembled. The matter suggested in the Bill was : \" For that she denied the Real Presence in the sacrament ofthe altar; and for saying the same was but a sign and figure of Christ's body; and that no Christian doth eat the body of Christ carnally, but spiritually.\" The evidence against her were her own husband and children; from whom she fled, for that they would compel her, by force, to be present at the celebration of mass. Notwithstanding, upon their testimonies the bill was found, and indorsed, \" Billa vera.\" Whereupon she came to her trial before William Starford, then Justice of Assize, (probably be that wrote the Pleas of the Crown,) where, upon a full hearing of the case, the Petty Jury also found her guilty, on the testimony aforesaid; after which she was pre sented to James Turbervill, Bishop of Exeter, for further examination on the premises, but she persisting in her former opinion, was by him condemned as a heretic. After her condemnation, she refused to receive any money from well-disposed people, that formerly relieved her, saying, she was going to that City where money had no mastery. Soon after she was delivered over to the secular power to be burnt, to Robert Cary, of Cock ington, Esq. then Sheriff of Devonshire, or to his Under Sheriff, who saw her executed at Southernhay, without the walls of Exon, in the 54th year of her age, and in"], [153, "BOYTON. 109 the month of November, 1558. This was the only per son in whose persecution Bishop Turbervill did appear, in matters of religion, during the time he sat in that see, (consecrated Sept. 8, 1555, deprived in January 1560,) and, as Dr. Fuller saith, her death was procured more by the violence of Blackston, the Chancellor, than by any persecution of the Bishop. And here it may not be impertinent to show, that our ancestors the Britons of Cornwall received and took the blessed Sacrament in the same sense as this martyr Agnes Prest did receive it; that is by faith only, con trary to the doctrine of Transubstantiation : as is evident from Mount Calvary, a manuscript in verse in the Cornish tongue, written about five hundred years since, a copy of which is now in my own custody, which con taineth the history of the Incarnation and Passion of Christ, according to St. John's Gospel ; wherein, amongst others, verse the 79th containeth these words :* Du benegas an bara, therag ay ys abestlye, An gorse ay ma, eshenoa, ynmeth Chrest, sur rag rye why Kemeras a berth, en bysma, dispersys henua nos avyth Dybbery tho gans cregyans, thu da gober teck hag gevyth Hay gwynsa wor an soys, ef a ranas in tretha Yn meth Chrest, henna ys goyse ow, evough why pur Cherity. Which sounds thus in English : God blessed the bread in presence (or among) his Apostles (or Disciples) ; The body of me in this, saith Christ, certainly given for you ; Taken secretly, and in this world despised, this night shall be, Eat it with faith, thy good, fair reward, and remission. And the wine on the wall he divided amongst them : Says Christ, this is my blood; drink you in pure charity. * The whole of Mount Calvary, with a translation by Mr. John Keigwin, made in the year 1682, has been printed by the Editor of this work from a manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The passage above cited occurs in the 44th and 45th stanzas. The general meaning appears to be the same, but the words are differently spelt and divided. The Editor has also printed \"The Creation ofthe World, with Noah's Flood,\" a Play, or Mystery, in the Cornish language, and a Translation into English by the same Mr. John Keig win; both from the office of Mr. Nichols, No. 25, Parliament-street, London, the printer of this work."], [154, "110 BOYTON Anno Dom. 1050, Berengarius, a deacon of Anglers in France, disproved and refuted the doctrine of Tran substantiation in a large manuscript, which he sent with letters to Lanfrank, then Abbat of Caen in Normandy, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury from 1070 to 1089, which letters and reasons, in the absence of Lanfrank, being opened by some of his clergy, the same were trans mitted to Pope Leo IX. whereupon calling a council at Rome, and the letters and reasons of Berengarius being read, he was condemned for an heretic in 1051. In France also tbe same year, Pope Leo IX. assembled an other council at Versailles against Berengarius, which likewise condemned him for a heretic. The like did Victor II. successor of Pope Leo IX. in 1055, in which council Berengarius answered personally for himself; That, as to the doctrine he taught concerning the Sacra ment, he adhered to no particular opinion of his own, but to that which was the ancient and common doctrine ofthe universal Church. After Pope Victor II. his successor Pope Nicholas II. assembled at Rome a council of a hundred and thirteen Bishops against Berengarius' doctrine ; who thereupon submitted the same to the Pope and his councils' cor rection, who prescribed him a form of recantation. But afterwards he published a refutation of that recantation, and of the doctrines therein contained, anno 1059- Notwithstanding which, the fourth council of Lateran, under Pope Innocent III. in 1160, (Frederick II. being then Emperor), consisting of four hundred bishops and holy fathers, established the Roman doctrine of Tran substantiantion, which was afterwards further confirmed by another council at Lateran, in Rome, under Pope Innocent V. an. Dom. 1215. TONKIN. The etymology of this name, Boyeton, may be either from the Cornish word \"byu,\" which is pronounced like"], [155, "BOYTON 111 \" boy,\" or from the French \"bois,\" a wood, which agrees extremely well with its situation in the midst of woods. I take most if not all the parish to be a part of or holden from the manor of Boyton, which belonged to the Priory of Launceston, and was ultimately given, inter alia, by King Henry the Eighth, to the Duchy of Cornwall, in exchange for the honour of Wallingford. the editor. For a detailed account of Berengarius, see Le Grand Dictionaire Historique, par Moreri, under the word Be renger, who refers to a great variety of authorities. The account given of Agnes Prest is curious, if she alone suffered in the whole diocese of Exeter during Queen Mary's persecution.

Its compact varieties are very quartzose, and form barren hills; but the schistose dunstone produces a good sub stratum, which near the Tamar affords productive arable and pasture land."], [156, "112 ST. BRADOCK. HALS. St. Bradock is situate in the Hundred of West, and has upon Uie south Boconock, the west St. Wennow, east St. Pynnock, north Cardinham, and by this name Bradock or Brodock it was taxed in the Domesday Roll.

The united parishes are now in the presentation of Lord Grenville. Bradock down was the scene of two important1 events in the civil war."], [157, "113 BRADOCK. First, a victory obtained by the King's forces early in 1623 under the command of Sir Bevill Granville, Sir Nicholas Glenning, Sir Ralph Hopton, Arundell, Tre vanion, and other gentlemen of the countv, over a much larger force commanded by Ruthven, Governor of Ply mouth. The victory was so complete that Ruthven with difficulty reached Saltash, accompanied by a few only of his troops, from whence they were speedily driven across the Tamar; and this advantage mainly contributed to the more splendid victory at Stratton, obtained on the 16th of May of the same year; a vic tory which, rolling on its tide of success through De vonshire and Somersetshire, over Lansdowne and Bris tol, might have swept the whole of England but for the recoil of its waves from the walls of Gloucester. The second event was on a more extensive scale. Lord Essex having conducted a large army into Cornwall, was followed by the King in person, till they approached so near that the King had his head quarters at Boconnoc, and Lord Essex at Lanhidrock, when, after various skirmishes and proposals for nego- tiation on the part of the King, Lord Essex at last, on the 30th or 31st of August 1644, accompanied by Lord Robartes, and some other officers, abandoned his army, and reached Plymouth by sea; and on the same day Sir William Belfour, with Col. Nicholas Boscowen, Lieut. -Col. James Hals, of Merther, Henry Courtenay, of St. Bennet's in Lanivet, Col. John Sentaubyn of Clawanar, his Lieut.-Col. Briddon, Col. Carter, and others of the horde of two thousand five hundred cavalry, forced their passage through the King's army, over St. Winnow, Boconnoc, and Bradock Downs, to Sal tash, and from thence to Plymouth. Their escape is said to have been mainly owing to the negligence of General Goring, whose ill conduct and exactions in Cornwall, have left his name as a term of severe re proach up to the present time. i"], [158, "114 BRADOCK. After these discouraging events, Major-Gen. Skippon found himself in command of the infantry, for whom he obtained a favourable capitulation, the particulars of which may be seen in Lord Clarendon's History, and they are given by Mr. Hals, from whose statement the above is chiefly abridged. Mr. Hals adds a circumstance illustrative of the ani mosity excited by internal dissensions; and, as his feelings and opinions were all on the royal side, the narrative may be esteemed deserving of credit. Notwithstanding the articles, the disarmed soldiers of the Parliament, as they inarched by the King and his army on Boconnoc and Bradock Downs, and else where, were barbarously slaughtered and shot upon by the King's soldiers, so that many perished thereby, others were stripped comparatively naked, and robbed of their money, others had their horses taken from them ; whereupon Major-General Skippon, with un daunted courage, rode up to the King's troop, and told him personally of the injury and violence offered, and the slaughter of his men, contrary to the articles, which in such cases were kept inviolable by all nations of men ; and therefore prayed the King to be just, and to prohibit those barbarities of his soldiers for the future, which the King forthwith commanded to be done. But his word and authority were little regarded while his army were in sight ofthe Parliamentary soldiers. This total discomfiture of Lord Essex's army left the King without an enemy in arms through the whole of Cornwall, and a letter is preserved in the hands of Lord Dunstanville from his ancestor Sir Francis Basset, re specting the last words addressed to him by the King: \" Mr. Sheriff, I leave the county entirely at peace in your hands.\""], [159, "115 ST.

St. Breock is situate in the hundred of Pyder, and hath upon the north St. Issy; east, Wadebridge on the Alan river ; south, St. Wenn and Withiel ; west, St. Columb Major. The name is derived from St. Breock or Briock, the patron of this church, of one in the island of Guernsey, and perhaps of Breage near Helston. This St. Breock was a native of Ireland, born at Cork about the fifth century. A man famous in his day, for the most strenuous support of the orthodox faith in opposition to Arianism, the heresy at that time distract ing the Latin Church. He was bishop of a diocese in Armorica, now called Britany, where the place of his residence is at this day distinguished by his name. This parish does not appear in the Bishop of Lin coln's valuation; but in that of Wolsey it is rated at 41/. 10s. 6d. i 2"], [160, "116 ST. BREOCK. In the Domesday survey this parish was rated under the district of Pelton or Penpow, now Powton. This Powton was the voke lands of a manor given to the See of our Cornish Bishop ; afterwards to the Bishop of Kirton, and then to Exeter ; finally to the Priory of St. Petroc at Bodmin. Alter the dissolution of monasteries, this barton, together with the extensive manor to which it belonged, passed through a great variety of hands by sale, so that Mr. Hals says the manor had sixteen lords of different families in about sixty-two years ; a muta bility not to be instanced in any other lands in Corn wall, except Fentongellon in St. Michael Penkivell, which also contained a religious house, but in 26 Henry VIII. was converted to secular purposes. This manor of Pelton has always possessed a court leet, where writs might be entertained without any limit of amount; but, the lord ofthe manor having suf fered from various escapes of persons confined for debt, the prison, and with it the judicial functions of the court, have been discontinued. Sir William Morice, the secretary of state and friend of General Monk, ac quired this manor by purchase. His second daughter, Barbara Morice, married Sir John Molesworth of Pea- at \u00a7*^ cemow, and brought this property into that family, where it still remains. Hurston in this parish, which I take to be from the Saxon, and to mean wood town, is still situated in a wood, and formerly belonged to the C^rmynews of Fen- tongellon. Tredinick gave name and origin to an ancient family of gentlemen. Christopher Tredinick was sheriff of Cornwall in 22 Henry VIII. ; he gave for his arms, In a field Or, on a bend Sable three bucks' heads caboshed Argent. His family and name are now, I take it, both extinct. In the time of Charles II. this property came by purchase to Lord Robartes. [Mr. Hals adds a fanciful derivation of this name;"], [161, "117 ST. BREOCK. but since \"doon\" and \"din\" are well known to signify a place tenable either by nature or art, and \" ick\" is unquestionably water, Tre-din-ick will be either the for tified town, or the hill town, near a river.] Trevorder, meaning the further town, or the one most distant ; also Trevorder Bickin, the far-off beacon-town, belonged to the Carmynews of Fentongellon, having come to them by the heiress of Trenowith, as Treno with had acquired it by the heiress of Tregago. It passed by sale from the Carmynews to Vyell, and has subsequently split between six coheiresses, who married Prideaux, Vyvyan, Dennis, Grensill, Rinden, aud Smith. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing worth inserting that differs from Mr. Hals, except perhaps his etymology of the name Dunveth, a place belonging once to Tredin ick, and situated near the churchyard, and therefore named the hill of graves; beth being a grave in Welch and Cornish, and the labials b and v perpetually chang ing into each other.

On the north and north-eastern parts of this parish, in the vicinity of the Camel, the land is fertile, resting on a rock which sometimes resembles a calcareous schist,"], [162, "118 ST. BREOCK but more commonly that kind of clay-slate which abounds in the calcareous series. This slate at Pen quean splits into very thin leaves, and is then quarried as a roofing slate, but is softer and has less lustre, and is not so durable as that raised at Delabole near Camel ford. The south and south-western parts of the parish consist of barren downs; the rock forming the substra tum is, however, very similar in appearance to what occurs in the other division ; but it contains more silex and is less laminated, does not easily cleave, and is less susceptible of decomposition than the former, and there fore produces only a meagre, arenaceous soil. ST. BREOCK IN KERRIER, or BREAGE. HALS. Is situate in the hundred aforesaid, and hath upon the north, Crowan; west, Germow; east, Sithney ; south, the British Channel.

It is now the mother church of Cury, Germow, and Gunwallo, and goes in presentation and consolidation with them, though at the time of the inquisition aforesaid they were taxed separate.

BREOCK IN KERRIER. 119 district of Treskeaw, that is to say the skeawe, or elder tree town, a place, as 1 am informed, well known and still extant there. In the pleas of the crown in the Exchequer, 12th Edward I., 1 found it thus written of Pengelly in this parish. \" Johannes de Treveally tenet in Pengelly, in comi tatu Cornubi\u00e6, dimidium acram terr\u00e6 Cornubiensem, (above a hundred English.) per sergiantiam recipiendi unam capam de grisando ad Pontem de Penleton, cum Rex fuerit inveniendus versus Cornubiam; et intrando Domino de Cabilla, qui earn in adventu domini Regis ibidem deferre debet, et earn tradere eidem Johanni, qui quidem Johannes eandem capam ferre debet cum domino Rege pro totam Cornubiam;\" which Mr. Hals interprets, that the half acre Cornish is held by the duty of its owner receiving a great coat from some one in Devonshire at Penleton Bridge, and to carry it about for the King's use, so long as he remains in Cornwall. In this parish stands the barton and manor of Good ol-gan, also God-al-gan, synonymous words, only va ried by the dialect, meaning a place that was altogether a wood down, a name anciently given and taken from the natural circumstances thereof. Otherwise, if the name consist of English- Cornish, God-ol-gan signifies a place that was altogether God's downs. As for the modern name Good-ol-phin, God-ol-fyn, it, in like man ner as the former, admits of no other etymology or con struction than that it was a place that was altogether a wood, fountain, well, or spring of water, or altogether God's fountain or spring of water. But because the words god, gud, good, in Cornish, Belgic, and British, are always taken and adopted in the first sense, to signify only a wood, and the words Du, Due, and Dyu, are the proper appellations of God, and no other in Cornish, I cannot apprehend how that sacred name is concerned in the initial part of this word, Godolphin, which refers,"], [164, "120 ST. BREOCK IN KERRIER, as I said before, to the circumstances of the place, viz. that no table, fountain, well, or spring of water here, that passeth beneath the house, through the gardens, and the woods and groves of timber that still surround the same. Contrary to this etymology, Mr. Carew, in his \"Sur vey of Cornwall,\" page 153, says that godolphin signi fies a white eagle, than which nothing can be more untrue ; for, in all those compound words, there is not one particle or syllable relating thereto, or any other than the British language whatsoever : for wen erew, wen eryr, wen eriew, and by contraction wen-er, is a white eagle in the Welch, Little-Britannic, and Cornish tongues. [See Dr. Davis's British Lexicon, and Floyd upon Aquila.] In like manner Verstegan tells us, that, in the Saxon tongue, blond erna is a white eagle; as also in the German and Dutch tongues; and the French dictionaries inform us that blanch \u00e6gle, or aegle, is a white eagle; aeros [aetos] in Greek ; aquila, in Latin; nesher in the Hebrew; from whence our British erew, erier, eryr, eriew, is derived. In opposition to all those etymologies of the word godolphin, Mr. Sammes in his Britannia, and the author of the additions to Camden's Britannia, tells us that godolac in the Phenician tongue signifies a land of tin, from whence they apprehend the name of godolphin is derived, especially because tin is found in the pre cincts thereof, but surely not comparable in quantity to what is made in forty other places in Cornwall, that yet come not under that denomination of godolphin, as being tin land. From the name I proceed to the matter or thing it self, viz. the manor and barton of Godolphin; which lands, in the time of Edward III., were the lands of Sir John Lamburne, Knight, of Lamburne in Peransand, whose daughter and heir was afterwards married to Sir Renphry, or John Arundell, of Lanherne, Knight, one"], [165, "121 OR, BREAGE. of whose posterity, viz. Edmond Arundell, Knight, tem pore Henry VI. sold the same to one Stephens, upon condition of a kind of domineering, lording, or insulting tenure, and reservation of rent to his manor of Lam burne in Peransand, viz. \" that once a year for ever the Reeve of the said Manor should come to Godolphin, and there boldly enter the hall, jump upon the table, or table-board, and there stamp or bounce with his feet or club, to alarm and give notice to the people of his ap proach, and then and there make proclamation aloud three times, 'Oyes! oyes! oyes ! I am the Reeve of the Manor of Lamburne in Peransand, come here to demand the old rent, duties, and customs, due to the lords of the said Manor from the lands of Godolphin.' Upon which notice there is forthwith to be brought him 2s. &d. rent, a large quart of strong beer, a loaf of wheaten bread worth sixpence, and a cheese of the like value; which the Reeve having received, he shall drink of the beer, taste the bread and cheese in the place, and then depart, carrying with him the said rent and re mainder of those viands, to the lords of the Manor aforesaid, to whom they are still duly paid, which at present are Sir John Seyntaubyn, Bart, and others, who claim it in right ofthe two daughters and heirs of the said Edmund Arundell, which were married to Danvers and Whitington, as Whitington's heirs were married to St. Aubyn and others. After Stephens purchased those lands of Godolphin from Arundell, and came possessed thereof, his only daughter and heir was married to Ralph Knava, or Nava, of ; which name or word is of quite another signification in the British tongue than what it signifies in the English ; for knava, nava, nawe, naue, signifies the same as servus, servulus, famulus, minis ter, administer, ministrator, in Latin; hence it is that in Trevisa's and Tyndale's translation of the Bible into English, the word is used in this sense by them ; Titus"], [166, "122 ST. BREOCK IN KERRIER, i, v. 1, \"Paul a knava of Jesus Christ;\" and the like, 2nd Timothy, chap. i. v. 1, \"Paul a nava of Jesus Christ ;\" which words, in the translation of the Bible in James I.'s time, the translators have rightly rendered into new English, by the names of\" Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ;\" and \" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ;\" that is, a messenger, an ambassador, or servant, sent, as apostolus ; in the original Greek bovXos (doulos), servus Kai et awoa-ToXos (apostolus) ; and in all other places in the Old and New Testament, where they met with the Greek words doulos and apostolus, they are by them so rendered. From the British names nave, nava, nawe, knawe, the old name or distinction of this tribe or family may be plainly inferred, for that the first ancestor or proge* nitor thereof was of a mere British extraction ; a ser* vant, steward, ambassador, minister, or messenger of God, Christ, his king, prince, or other master, (for those words are all synonymous, only by the dialect varied with the transposing of a vowel,) and is a name of office of one that is a substitute or vicegerent, and acts under another. But more certain I am that John Knava, of Godol phin, Esq. was struck Sheriff of Cornwall by King Henry VII., 1504, who declared his great likiug of that gentleman in all circumstances for the said office, but discovered as much dislike of his name after the English, not understanding the import thereof in Cornisb, and so further said, that, as he was pater pa tri\u00e6, he would transnominate him to Godolphin, whereof he was lord; and accordingly caused or ordered that in his letters patent under the broad seal of England, for being Sheriff of Cornwall, he should be styled or named John Godolphin, of Godolphin, Esq. and by that name he accounted at the year's end with that king for his office in the Exchequer, and had his acquittance from thence, as appears from the record in the Pipe Office there."], [167, "123 OR, BREAGE.

His younger brother, Sidney Godolphin, Esq. Member of Parliament for Helston, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, who had been sent several embassies to foreign princes, was by King Charles II. by letters patent bearing date 8th Sept. 1684, created Lord Godolphin and Baron of Rialton. Certes, from the time that this family was seised of Godolphin, such a race of famous, flourishing, learned, valiant, prudent men have served their prince and country in the several capacities of members of Parlia ment, justices of the peace, deputy lieutenants, sheriffs, colonels, captains, majors, aud other officers, both mili tary and civil, as scarce any other family this country hath afforded, which I do not mention (for that my great-grandmother on the one side, the wife of Sir John Arundell, of Tolverne, Knight, was daughter of the aforesaid Sir Francis Godolphin, Knight, Sheriff of Cornwall 21 Elizabeth,) but as their just character and merit; and I challenge the envious justly to detract from the same.

After that King's death he was by Queen Anne made sole Lord High Treasurer of England, 1701, in which station he continued with unblamable conduct till the year 1710, the time of his death, (having been before, by that Queen, created Earl Godolphin,) a place of such import, trust, grandeur, and honour, as no Cornishman before him ever arrived to, except the Lord Benham, (or rather their name of old Cardinham,) temp.

This place afterwards, by his unthrifty son and heir, John Hals, had all its timber cut down that was growing upon it, and sold, which tradition saith was great store ; the lands also were sold to Godolphin and some others.

Mr. Sidney Godolphin must be considered as the most eminent statesman and politician of this county, not excepting Lord Chatham, if his birth at Boconnoc should be deemed sufficient to make him a Cornish man. Advanced to the honour of Earl of Godolphin, de corated with the Garter, and placed in high office as Lord High Treasurer, he mainly conducted the great national affairs at home, while the Duke of Marlbo rough vindicated, by splendid victories in the field, the religious and civil liberties of the world. > Victorque volentes Per populos dat jura; viamque affectat Olympo. To Lord Godolphin we are also indebted for conduct ing to a successful conclusion a measure most beneficial to this whole island, the Union with Scotland ; and the whole tenour of his administration procured for him, with the consent of all parties, the appellation of Wise.

The Earldom of Godolphin expired also on the death of Francis Godolphin in 1766; but a Barony had been conferred on him, with remainder to the heirs of his uncle Henry Godolphin; this fell to his first cousin Francis Lord Godolphin. On his decease in 1785 the name and honour of Godolphin became extinct. But Mary, daughter and eventually sole heir of Francis the second and last Earl of Godolphin, had married Thomas Osborne, fourth Duke of Leeds, and his great-grandson Francis Godolphin D'Arcy Osborne, Duke of Leeds, in herits the property as heir-at-law. The Godolphins appear never to have possessed an estate in land beyond the limits of what might fairly belong to a private gentleman ; but the produce of tin has been very great from the period recorded by Mr. Carew, so that the name of the place may well be derived from that metal; subsequently, the produce of copper has exceeded that of the tin. The whole parish of Breage is covered by mines, and the largest and most productive, and most expensive tin mine ever known, is now producing a greater quantity of metal than was yielded in former times by the whole county. Whele Vor, now employing several steam-engines of the largest size to exhaust the water, and numerous others to draw up the ore, and afterwards to reduce it into the state of a fine powder, is said to have used, about a cen tury ago, the first steam-engine ever seen in Cornwall. Pengelly in this parish was the residence, for many generations, of the Spernons or Sparnons.

This extensive parish includes nearly the whole of that granitic patch known by the names of Tregonning and Godolphin Hills; and it also comprises the greater part of the country lying between those hills and those ofthe opposite range of granite in Wendron and Cro wan, called the Forest. Its mines, quarries, and sea cliffs afford most interesting geological sections. The granite of Godolphin Hill is of the common kind, containing in several places an intermixture of shorl, and it is traversed by numerous thick veins of quartz, which sometimes pass into compact shorl rock. The granite of Tregonning Hill is of two kinds ; one fine-grained like free-stone, which is extensively quar ried on the western side of the hill, and used for orna mental building, under the name of Breage stone; the other, abounding in talc, and in a state of considerable decomposition, affording, like the similar granites of St. Austell and St. Stephen's, the china clay, which-is here worked for economical purposes, but not to any great extent. The western part of the celebrated mine Whele Vor is situated in Breage ; and, as the workings approach the granite, they exhibit a highly interesting arrangement of rocks, the granite and slate alternating in the same manner as they have been observed to do at Delcoath in Cambourne. The composition of these rocks, and the nature of their connection, are very evidently seen"], [173, "129 ST. BREWARD. in the heaps of fragments piled round the shafts ; but they are better and more clearly illustrated in the cliffs near Trewaras Head. It would occupy two much space to enter into details on this important subject. It may, however, be noticed that both the granite and the slate gradual!}' pass into each other; and that they appear to differ very little in their mineral composition. These facts seem to explain, in a satisfactory manner, the nature of granite veins. For, if both rocks have a similar composition, and have been produced at the same time, the form, position, contents, and other circumstances of these veins, are no longer perplexing. ST. BREWARD. HALS. St. Breward is situate in the hundred of Trigg, and hath upon the north Advent, south Blisland, east Altar Nun, west St. Tudy. There was not such parish or church extant in Cornwall at the time of the Norman Conquest as Brewer ; probably it was taxed under Tudy.

The present name of this church is celebrated in memory of its founder, William Brewer, (son of William Lord Brewer, Baron of Odcombe in Somerset,) who was consecrated Bishop of Exeter, 1224, and was afterwards, by King Henry III., sent on divers K"], [174, "130 ST. BREWARD. embassies to foreign princes, and to conduct Isabel, sister of the said King Henry, to be married to Fre derick the Emperor, whom he and Peter de Rupibus, Knight, afterwards accompanied into Palestine, and were made generals of 40,000 men against the Turks. And after all those fatigues, as Bishop Godwin saith, he returned home safely to his see of Exeter, and spent the remainder of his days in building and endowing churches, adorning and enriching his own cathedral church, and instituting within the same a dean and twenty-four prebendaries, allowing the latter a stipend of Al. per annum, since augmented to 20/. (which is no more than Al. in those days was worth). He also set up a chantor, chancellor, and treasurer within the same. To the chantor and subdean thereof he appropriated the rectory of Rainton and Chudleigh in Devon, and the rectory then, now a vicarage, of Eglos hayle, in Cornwall. To the chancellor he appropriated (or impropriated) the vicarage of Newlan in Cornwall, and Stoke Gabriel in Devon, on condition that he should preach a sermon once a week. To the canons a lecture in Divinity, or on the Decretals, within the cathedral of Exeter, and in case the chancellor should fail in this particular, it should be lawful for the bishop thereof for the time being to resume the said churches so appro priated, into his own hand, and bestow them at his plea sure; as appears from a deed between the said bishop, dean, and chapter, 12th May, 1662, as Hooker saith. But this covenant is exactly kept ever since by the chancellor or his clerk, who once a week, at six o'clock morning prayers, preach a sermon to the canons. This Bishop Brewer appropriated this church bearing his name to the dean and chapter of this cathedral, which he had as aforesaid erected. He lies buried in the middle of the choir thereof, with an inscription still legible, which, amongst others, containeth these words : Hie jacet Willielmus Brewer, quondam hujus Eccle-"], [175, "131 ST.

By the four principal dignities or dignitaries of the church, I \u2022suppose, is meant the dean, chantor, chancellor, and treasurer thereof. The deanery of Exon was founded by William Bri were, Bishop of Exon 1225.* TONKIN. This parish of St. Breward is also called Simon Ward; and the popular legend has changed a pious and vene rable bishop into one Simon Ward, a domestic brewer to King Arthur. I rather conjecture that on the divi sion of parishes it was called Brewer from \" bruiers,\" which in the French tongue is \" heath.\" THE EDITOR. The principal villages in in this parisb are Lank Ma jor, Lank Minor, without doubt Lank Vrauz, and Lank Vean; perhaps Jank may be lan, varying with local pronunciation in the absence of all orthography, when the names will signify the great and small inclosure; also Swallock. Mr. Lysons states that the ancient manor of Hamethy, or Hametethy, is situated in this parish, five-sixths belonging to Mr. Mitchell of Hen gar, in the adjacent parish of St. Tudy, and the other sixth to Mr. Kekewich. But this parish is distinguished from all others in Cornwall by the locality of Roughtor and Brown Willy ; these hills, pre-eminent from their elevation, and from the granite crags studded over the whole expanse of their surfaces, may be seen from an elevation crossed by the road near Ilfracombe in the north of Devon, and * This is written in a different hand.

Present Vicar, the Rev. T. J. Landon, presented in 1815 by the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The greater part of this parish is situated on granite, including within its boundaries Roughtor and Brown Willy, the highest hills in Cornwall, the latter being 1368 feet above the level of the sea. The composition of this granite has been already noticed under the head of Advent: it affords few varieties, which may be owing to its offering few opportunities for examination. The circumstance most attractive of attention is the great sterility of this extensive district; some few con tracted spots are indeed brought into cultivation ; some parts afford summer pasturage for cattle, and others turf for fuel ; but by far the greater portion of the whole lies entirely unproductive. Aud this character belongs to the whole insulated patch of granite more than ten miles in diameter ; and the church of St. Breward is the only one to be found on this extensive surface of perhaps from forty to fifty thousand acres ; while nine churches are to be found on the granite district of the Land's End, where this substratum, departing from its usual quali ties, gives fertility to the soil. The western extremity of this parish is fertile, resting on a peculiar kind of slate, which possesses geological interest. It may be seen at Combe, at Penrose, and at other places near the river Camel, and appears to be a"], [177, "BRIDGERULE. 133 variety of mica slate, being composed of granular fel spar, interlaminated with mica. It contains beds of dark purple felspar rock, very similar to that which abounds in the mining district in the western part of the county. This micaceous slate gradually passes into a thick lamellar rock, which extensively disintegrates and becomes argillaceous, exactly resembling the stone quarried for building at Bodmin. BRIDGERULE. HALS. Bridgerule is situate in the hundred of Stratton, i. e. street or highway town. Now the part of the parish that is on the north side of the river Tamar, hath upon the north Launcells, west Marham Church, south Whit stone, east the Tamar river. The church stands on the Devonshire side, in the Halisworthy hundred, so that this rule or dominion ofthe Bridge extendeth itself into both counties, as to spirituals and temporals. In the Valor Beneficiarum, it is called Brige Rowell. Ecclesia de Bridge Rule, in Decanatu de Stratone, was taxed to the Pope's annats, in 1294, at vl. His. 8d. Vicar ibidem nihil propter paupertatem. In Wolsey's Inquisition it was taxed at 14/., and the parish was rated to the 4s. land-tax, in 1696, at 45/. 3s. At the time of the Domesday Roll, 20 W. Conq. this district was taxed under the name of Tacabere, which place is now the dwelling place of Mr. Samuel Gilbert. TONKIN. Mr. Risdon, in his History of Devon, part ii. p. 298, gives the true etymology of this place, in those words, \"Bridge Renold, of the vulgar Bridge Rule, anciently"], [178, "134 BRIDGE RULE. Brige, by which name it is sitffply so called before the Norman Conqueror bestowed it upon Reginald * Adobed, and hence it took the adjunct of its owner.\" The origi nal ofthe primitive name is the bridge connecting the two parts across the Tamar. The manor of Tackbere, in Domesday called Taca bere, was one of those which the Conqueror bestowed on his half-brother the Earl of Morton. THE EDITOR. This manor of Tacabre, or Takkebere, which appears to have been very extensive, is said by Mr. Lysons to have been bestowed by King Edward the Third on the Abbey of St. Mary of Graces, which appears in Tan ner's Notitia Monastica to have been founded by that king in the years 1349 \u2014 50, in the new church-yard of the Holy Trinity, eastward of the Tower of London. The manor has since acquired the name of Merrifield, probably Maryfield, from the monastery. It was for many years the property of Gilberts, a branch from the Gilberts of Crompton Castle, near Torbay. The only daughter of the last Mr. Gilbert, of Tackbere, married Mr. Cotton Amy, of Botreaux Castle, who left two daughters; Anne, who survived her sister, but died un married after a long insanity ; and Grace, married to Mr. Jonathan Phillipps, of Camelford, and of Newport, near Launceston, who was subsequently knighted in 1786, on the memorable occasion afforded by Margaret Nichol son. This lady had several children : two daughters were alive at the time of her decease in 1788, but they both died in twelve months after their mother, and Tack bere has ascended through the two female lines, and be come vested in the right beirs-at-law of Mr. Samuel Gilbert, the father of Mrs. Amy. * The Domesday surname, however, is still nearer to the modern orthogra phy; being, not Reginald, hut Ruald Edit."], [179, "135 BUDOCK.

Budock is situate in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath upon the north Gluvias, east Falmouth, west Mawnan, south the British channel ; and by the name of Bowidoc it was taxed in Domesday Roll, a corruption of Bud-oc, or Bud-ock, signifying a bay, cove, creek, haven, or inlet of waters, and oak ; according to the ancient natu ral circumstances ofthe place. In the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Win chester, 1294, into the value of benefices, in order to the Pope's annats, ecclesia de Sancto Budoco, in de canatu de Kerrier, is rated at 61. At that time, it seems, it was not consolidated into Gluvias ; though afterwards, in Wolsey's Inquisition, they were united, as will appear in that place.

The barton of Arwinike, their chief seat in former ages, being within this parish, till Falmouth parish where it now stands was dismem bered from it by Act of Parliament 1663, near which monument is a stone fastened to the wall of the said church, also containing the memorial of Sir Nicholas Parker, Knight, some time Governor of Pendennis Castle, who married the widow of Erisey, one or ihe coheirs of Militon of Pengerwick, and died 1608, who was suc ceeded in that dignity by Sir Nicholas Hals of Fenton gollan, Knight. The arms of Parker were, as I take it, Chequy, a fess. Ros-meran in this parish, was of old the lands of Killigrew. Trescobays, also Triscobays, Triscovays, in this pa rish, (synonymous words, signifying treble or threefold kisses,) was the dwelling of William Gross, gentleman, that married Erisey the widow of Charles Vyvyan, of Merthin, Esq. mother of Sir Richard Vyvyan, Baronet, who, upon some jealousy or discontent of his wife, drank a pint or quart of brandy, entered his chamber, took a pistol and charged it with a brace of bullets, and then forthwith shot himself dead, about the year 1693.

On the western side of this parish, behind Arwinnick, the seat of Sir Peter Killigrew, is a large pool, like a little harbour, between two hills, but that it hath a bar of sand and pebbles, which keepeth out the sea, like that of the Loe near Helston. It is commonly called the Swan Pool, for that Sir Peter Killigrew, to whom it belongs, kept abundance of swans here. Trewoon, or Treoon, in this parish, the downy dwell ing, or hous^ in the downs, was the seat of the Carnsews, who had their name from their habitation at Carnsew in Mabe, where they formerly possessed a fine estate, which, being wasted by extravagant living, this barton was at first mortgaged, and a little after the late Revolution, sold by Mr. John Carnsew to Joseph Trewinnard, rector of Mawnan. THE EDITOR. The manor of Penwerris, become of great value by its proximity to Falmouth, is the property of Lord de Dunstanville, derived from his grandmother Mary Pen darves of Roscrow. The best part of Falmouth itself is now built on this property, and distinguished by the name of Green Bank. Budock measures 3507 statute acres.

The extreme western part, adjoining Mabe, consists of granite of a very crystalline variety, and excellent for"], [182, "138 BURIAN. building; it is exported in great quantities from Penryn. Nearly the whole western half of the parish is coarse; but the eastern part is well cultivated. The soil rests on a species of hornblend slate, which furnishes deep soil by its decomposition. On the sea shore at Swanpool a most interesting phe nomenon occurs in a bed of felspar porphyry, (elvan course,) which runs north-east and south-west for seve ral hundred feet : near low water it exhibits that ap pearance called by the miners a heave. The course terminates abruptly, and begins again about twenty feet further to the south, from whence it goes on as be fore the heave. This porphyry is decomposed at the surface and to some depth, into a fine white clay, from which bricks of a good quality are made on the spot. BURIAN. HALS. Burian is situated at the western extremity of the county, having two adjoining parishes, Senner and St. Levan annexed; the former of which includes (the Lands' End. In Domesday tax this district was rated by the name of Beriand, for Berian or Bury-an ; syno nymous words, signifying a cemetery or burying place for human creatures; that is to say, that place which is now called the churchyard, which was an inclosure, as in most other places, converted to that use before and since the church was erected therein. This instance of a Domesday Roll, wherein this district is named Beri-an, overthrows the story of Camden's conjecture, that, the name thereof was derived from one St. Buryana, an"], [183, "139 BURIAN. Irishwoman that was the tutelar guardian of this church, whereas the appellation of Saint, as I have elsewhere observed, at that time was not given to but one church in Cornwall. Besides, this Irish saint is not to be found in the Roman legend, or calendar, nor in Capgrave's catalogue of English and Irish Saints. This church was founded and endowed by King Athelstan, about the year 930, after such time as he had conquered the Scilly Islands, as also the county of De von ; and made Cornwall tributary to his sceptre. To which church he gave lands and tithes of a considerable value for ever, himself becoming the first patron thereof, as his successors the Kings of England have been ever since: for which reason it is still called the royal rec tory, or regal rectory, and tbe royal or regal peculiar. Signifying thereby that this is the church or chapel per taining to the king, or immediately under the jurisdic tion of him as the supreme ordinary, from when there is no appeal; whereas other peculiars, though exempt from the visitation or jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop within whose see they stand, yet are always subject to the provincial archbishops of Canterbury and York, or other persons. This church or college consisted of canons augus tines, or regular priests, and three prebendaries, who enjoyed the revenues thereof in common, but might not marry ; and the lord chancellors of England of old vi sited this peculiar, which extended only over the pa rishes of Burian, Sennen, and St. Levan, for the king. One of the Popes of Rome, about the time of Edward III. obtruded upon this church, the canons and pre bends thereof, a dean to be an inspector and overseer over them : whom he nominated to be the bishop of Exon for the time being, who for some time visited this church as its governor, as the lord chancellor did before; which encroachment of the Pope being observed by Edward 111., as appears from the register of the writs,"], [184, "140 BURIAN. folio 40 and 41 ; 8 Edward III. rot. 97. This usurpa tion of the Pope was taken away. [Mr. Hals here enters into long dissertations respect ing secular canons, regular canons, the state generall}' ofthe church and ofthe clergy, benefices held in com mendam, &c. which, not having any particular relation to the parochial history of Cornwall, are omitted.] Boscawen-ros in this parish, compounded of Bo scawen-ros, is a name given and taken from the natural circumstances of the place, and signifies in Cornish- British \"a valley, notable for skeawe or scawen\" trees. And indeed this place, being naked and exposed to the sea on the cliffs of the British Channel, anciently, as it seems, produced no other trees than scawen, (i. e. elder,) proper to that part of the country ; neither, I think, is there any other trees at present that grow there. From this place was transnominated an Irish gentleman that settled here either by marriage or purchase, in the latter end of the reign of Edward IV., who discontinued his paternal name, and styled himself John de Boscawen, which latter name hath been the hereditary name of his posterity ever since; who from hence transplanted their dwellings to Tregameer in St. Colomb Major; and Tre vallock in Creed or St. Stephen's ; and from thence, by marriage with the daughter and heir of Tregothnan by Lawrence Boscawen, gentleman, attorney-at-law, temp. Henry VII., who died 1567, and lieth buried in the north aile of St. Michael Penkivell Church, as is testi fied by a brass inscription on his gravestone, there lately extant, upon which, on a lead escutcheon, was engraved bis paternal coat armour, viz. in a field Vert, a bull passant Argent, armed Or; on a chief Ermine, a rose Gules; crest a boar Argent: \u2014 out of a supposed allusion to their present name, as if it had signified a white bull and a rose. In the reign of James I. his pos terity discontinued this bearing, and gave only for their arms, Ermine, a rose ; which, I take it, also is the here-"], [185, "141 BURIAN. ditary coat armour of Beverley. See St. Michael Pen kivell. Since the writing hereof this place is become the hereditary honorary title of Hugh Lord Boscawen, Baron of Boscawen-rose, and Viscount of Falmouth. Upon Boscawen downs, some of which was lately the lands of Mr. Christopher Davis, stands a monu ment called Dance Meyns, that is to say the dance stones ; which are nineteen pyramidal stones, about six foot high above ground, set in a round circle, distaut from each other about twelve feet, having in the centre one pitched far bigger than the rest; a little to tbe north of those are two admirable great stones in perpendicular manner, much bigger than the rest, those are vulgarly called the Pipers. But since it is not probable that those stones were either dancers or pipers, I take the common appellation dance meyns, only by the dialect to be a corruption of dans meyns, id est, men's stones ; that is to say stones set up in memory of once so many famous men that lived in those parts, or lie interred there, before the sixth century.* Mr. Davis aforesaid informed me, that, contiguous with those dans meynes, he caused not long since divers barrows of earth to be carried abroad in order to manure his lands, in several of which bur rows he found two or three urns or earthern pots, sound and firm, having in them pieces of bones, and ashes. * That there exists, however, a prevalent connection of these monuments with allusions to dancing, is shown in the the Essay on Dracontia, by the Rev. J. B. Deane, F.S.A. iu Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. xxv. The name of Dans Maen is generally given to the various stone circles in the county of Cornwall. Dr. Bor lase remarks that there are four circles in the hundred of Penrith, having nine teen stones each ; viz. Boscawen-un, Rosmodrevy, Tregaseal, and Boskednan, the two most distant being not eight miles apart. Of Boscawen On there are views in the works of Borlase and Stukeley, as well as among the more accu rate etchings by William Cotton, Esq. 4to. 1827. He has also given a view and plan ofthe dans-meyne at Bolleit in this parish ; and two obeliscal stones at the same place are represented in Borlase, pi. 10. See also in pi. 14 the hanging stone in Karn Boscawen, and a Maen T61, or holed stone, both in Burian ; as is the circle called Rosmodrevy. \u2014 Edit."], [186, "142 BURIAN. About twenty years past, the sexton of this parish sinking a grave four feet deep in the ground, he met with a large flat marble or other stone, which he lifted up out of the earth, on which was cut or engraved a long plain cross, surmounted on four gfieces or steps ; on the border of this stone, round the said cross, was an inscription in Norman French, which soundeth thus in English : \u2014 \" Clarice, the wife of Geffery de Bolleit, lies here ; whosoever shall pray for her soul shall have ten days' pardon. Amen.\" * There is a place still extant in this parish called Bolait, or Bolaith, i. e. a place of slay ing or killing cows, kine, or cattle; otherwise it may be interpreted cow's milk, or a place notable for the same. Trove, in this parish, is, in Cornish and Armorick, a dent, pit, a cavern, or valley : a name doubtless taken from the natural and artificial circumstances of the place, situate between two hills, on a cavern ; also Tre woofe, that is to say the town or dwelling of ob-yarn, such as the sail-spinsters make, in order to be woof, or woven cross the warp in pieces of cloth, stuff, or serges, from whence was denominated a family of gentlemen named Trewoofe ; who, out of a mistaken etymology of their name, (as many others in Cornwall,) gave for their arms, in a field three wolves' heads ; whereas, try-bleith, try-bleit, is three wolves in Cornish ; the heiress of which family was married to Leveale, temp. Henry VIII. of the old Norman race, whose posterity flourished here in good fame for several descents, till, for want of issue male, Lewis Leveale's daughter and heir, by Cooke of Tregussa, carried this place, together with herself in marriage, to Mr. Uspar or Vospar, temp.

This last gentleman, Mr. Vospur, bathing himself in the river Isis in Oxfordshire, with other young men, was there unfortunately drowned, about the year 1679. The name Vosper or Vospur, in British-Cornish, signifies a pure or immaculate maid or virgin. The arms of Le veale were three calves or veals. In the middle of this barton of Trove, on the top of a hill, is still extant the downfalls of a castle or treble intrenchment called , in the midst of which is a hole leading to a vault under ground. How far it extends no man now living can tell, by reason of the damps or thick vapours that are in it ; for as soon as you go an arrow flight in it or less, your candles will go out, or extinguish of themselves, for want of air. For what end or use this vault was made is uncertain, though it is probable it was an arsenal or store-house for laying up arms, ammunition, corn, and provision, for the soldiers of the castle wherein it stands, in the wars between Charles I. and his Parliament. Divers of the royal party, pursued in the West by the Parliament troops under Sir Thomas Fairfax, were privately con veyed into this vault as far as they could proceed with safety, where Mr. Leveale fed and secured them till they found opportunity to make their escapes to the king's friends and party.

Burnewall, in this parish, id est, the walled well or well-pit of waters, so called from some such place on the lands thereof, was also formerly the lands of the said William Noy, who sold it to the said Mr. Davis, who conveyed it to his nephew Henry Davis on his mar riage with Hester, daughter of Humphrey Noy, Gent. younger brother of the said William Noy, now in pos session thereof, and hath issue.

This parish is of large extent, and the land generally good, and lying very warm on the South Sea, which,"], [189, "145 BURIAN. with the desire of living quiet, has induced several gen tlemen to settle themselves in this remote corner of the kingdom, where they may liberally entertain all such as out of curiosity come to visit the Land's End. Mr. Francis Paynter was brother to Doctor William Paynter, Rector of Exeter College, Oxford, (elected in 1690, died Feb. 19, 1715, aged eighty, was rector of Wootton in Northamptonshire, where he is buried, \u2014 Editor;) both younger brothers to Mr. Paynter of Tre lisick's father, who by his skill in husbandry, in which he has scarce his fellow, not his superior in the county, and some helps of the law, has purchased to himself a very fair younger brother's inheritance. Though this place lies near the sea, and very much exposed, yet has this gentleman, by the means of furze ricks and other ingenious contrivances, raised several fair walks of trees about it, and made it a pleasant and profitable seat, which I mention here, that those who live' under the same inconveniences may imitate his industry. At Leigha liveth Mr. Oliver Ustick, married to Julia the eldest of two daughters of Roscrow of Penryn, of the family of Roscrows of Roscrow. Leigha is part of the manor of Rosemadans, now the property of Mr. Grosse. Boscawanrose, in this parish, gave name and habitation to the famous and honourable family of Boscawan, who, led away, as many other Cornish gentlemen have been, by the similarity of sound between words in the Kerna wish tongue and others in French or in Latin, have mis taken rose a valley, for the flower a rose ; and more an ciently the}' are said to have borne in their arms, besides a rose, an ox, having mistaken the word bos, which sig nifies a house or dwelling, for the name of that animal. THE EDITOR. It seems very improbable that King Athelstan, after .founding and splendidly endowing a church to comme- L"], [190, "146 BURIAN. morate or to sanctify his conquest of Cornwall, should bestow on it a name so very indiscriminate as The burial ground; more especially at a time when missionaries from Ireland had recently converted the inhabitants to Christianity, and had left to posterity a reputation for piety so elevated as to invest them at once with the ap pellation of saints, and to procure for them, in after times, the dedication of almost all the churches through out the County. St. Burian is mentioned by Leland, Camden, Tanner, and various other antiquaries, as a holy woman from Ireland, to whom King Athelstan dedicated this church, and in Doctor Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints, &c. her festival is given on the 4th of June. The establishment consisted of a dean and three pre bendaries, who are said by Mr. Lysons to have held from the King by the service of saying a hundred masses and a hundred psalters for the souls ofthe King and of his ancestors. It is not stated how frequently those recita tions were to take place. Bishop Tanner, in the Notitia Monastica, states that this deanery was seised into the king's hands in the time of Edward III. under the pretence that John de Mount, the third dean, was a Frenchman. In 18 Henry VI. this deanery vtas given to his college (King's) in Cam bridge ; and afterwards, by Edward IV. probably in the true spirit of party, to the collegiate church of Windsor. It was, however, soon separated from Windsor, and continues, according to the foundation of Athelstan, exempt from all inferior jurisdiction, and consequently since Henry VIII.'s assumption of all temporal power exercised by the Pope, there is not any appeal from the local authorities but to the king himself; a consti tution most inexpedient, and likely to produce the most serious inconvenience, if matters of much importance ever came for investigation and decision before a court wholly unfitted, from its very nature, from entertain-"], [191, "147 BURIAN. ing them ; and yet empowered to declare a judgment final to all intents and purposes, unless it is immediately revised by the highest and most expensive ecclesiastical tribunal. This exemption from all episcopal authority has, in times not very remote, admitted of such abuses in the administration of divine service, and of the spiritual care ofthe three parishes, as would not otherwise have been endured. It would be worse, however, than use less to expatiate on a system which is fortunately passed by. I believe that no dean has resided since the final dissolution ofthe college; the Royner's hand having been there so forcibly applied as to wrest off the whole glebe, not leaving even an habitation, nor the small est portion of land on which a house could be built. The nominal deanery of St. Burian, like that of Battle and two or three more, is not esteemed a dignity in the church : yet with cure of souls, and for no better reason than its not being mentioned eo nomine in the canons and acts of Parliament, this living is allowed to be tenable with all other preferments, and at all dis tances. Pendrea, the birth place and property of Mr. William Noye the attorney-general, was sold by his eldest son, Edward Noye, to Mr. Davies of Burnuhall, and by his grandson to Mr. Tonkin, whose great grandson, the Rev. Uriah Tonkin, possesses it at this time. At Bur nuhall there still remains a curious performance of shell-work, said to have been made by Mr. Davies' daughters, strongly expressive of the political feelings then almost universal throughout Cornwall. King Charles II. is represented flying from his enemies, and one of them, in full pursuit, has a legend, \"This is the heir ! come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own!\" whilst an angel exclaims in the same manner from a cloud \"Is it not written, Thou shalt l 2"], [192, "148 BURIAN. do no murder?\" The material of this work is found in great variety and beauty round the coast, and particu larly at Porth Kernow, near the Logging Rock. The last Mr. Davies of Burnuhall married Kegwin of Newlyn ; he wasted tbe remains of a property which had been gradually diminishing in the hands of his father and of his grandfather; so that about the year 1750, Burnuhall and some other farms were sold to Admiral Boscawen. Boskenna is the property and residence of Mr. Francis Paynter, a very respectable gentleman and magistrate, the great-grandson, I believe, of the individual distinguished by Mr. Hals for his skill in husbandry. There is a tradition of his having purchased the place of one whose family had long possessed it, but who had ultimately become the huntsman of a pack of hounds kept origi nally as his own. Mr. Francis Paynter, uncle of the gentleman now possessed of Boskenna, was greatly distinguished for his wit and humour. He was either the sole or joint author of a poem made in imitation of Prior's Alma, and in ridicule of the then dean of Burian, called \"The Consultation.\" Mr. Paynter practised his profession of the law near St. Columb. He married Miss Pender of Penzance, and left several sons. The exercise of wit is not always, perhaps not frequently, associated with pecuniary gain. The Editor has heard Mr. Paynter declare that \"The Consultation\" prevented his obtain ing a valuable stewardship from the family of which the dean was a member. The Vyvyans of Trelovornow are said to have origi nated from Treviddror in this parish. And Lord Chief Justice Tresilian was from Burian, in whose descend ants Pendor and Ristchurch, after the lapse of nearly five centuries, some of his property still remains. From about fifty to seventy years ago Boskenna at tracted much attention, and gave occasion to various"], [193, "149 BURIAN. conjectures over the whole neighbourhood, in conse quence of a gentleman and lady residing there under the assumed name of Browne, and withdrawing themselves entirely from public observation. They were conjec tured to be members of some distinguished family on the continent implicated in political disputes; or at the least, some very eminent persons of our own country, till at last the mystery was explained by a disclosure of their real name and condition. Mr. Berty Birge, having been involved in the pe cuniary affairs of an individual who subsequently be came insane, found himself obliged to retire, although it is understood that nothing discreditable to his cha racter occurred in the transactions. On that indi vidual's decease Mr. Birge resumed his real name, and removed to Penzance, where he passed the remainder of his life. The church of St. Burian is among those most dis tinguished for size and beauty in the west of Cornwall. It is situated on high ground, with a lofty tower, con spicuous therefore from a very great distance. It pos sessed, till within these few years, a curious rood-loft. A station of the great trigonometrical survey was placed in 1796 very near Burian church, and in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800, the latitude ofthe tower is stated to be 50\u00b0 4' 32.8\", and the longitude is 5\u00b0 36' 10.5\", or in time 22' 24.7\" west of Greenwich.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The whole of this parish, with the exception of a small patch of slate at Rosemodris, rests on granite. Judging from what occurs in the eastern part of Corn wall, one might be led to expect that the land of St. Burian must be sterile. In some elevated spots it un doubtedly is so, but in general the parish is well culti vated and highly productive. This difference in the granitic soils of east and of west Cornwall, may be, in part, explained by the gradual diminution of height towards the west, accompanied by a corresponding improvement of the climate ; but in this part ofthe county more ofthe debris, especially of diluvial clay, is retained on the surface, that of the more elevated eastern ridges having been in great measure swept away. This circumstance must not, however, be omitted. The granite of Burian exhibits more varieties than have been yet found in the eastern district. The slate in the cliffs at Rosemodris is a felspar rock, and its contact with the granite is distinctly seen ; where it may be observed at the eastern extremity traversed by numerous granite veins ; and the granite near this junction abounds in shorl. NOTE BY THE EDITOR. Doctor Paris has remarked on the granite of this district, that it contains full twenty-five per cent of felspar, which he says at once explains the rapidity of this stone's decomposition, and the fertility which is so very unusual in granitic countries; and that this granite in a state of decomposition, when it is provin cially called growan, has actually been applied to some lands as a manure, and with the best effect. I had the pleasure of attending Doctor Withering (author of the Arrangement of British Plants, &c.) to"], [195, "151 CALLINGTON. the Land's End in 1793, when he expressed much sur prise at the fertility of a granitic soil, and explained it as Doctor Paris has since done, by observing that in all the granite he had previously seen siliceous matter abounded, and that the very word was synonymous with sterile, but that here felspar and fertility appeared together. Felspar is said to contain nearly a third part of its weight of alumine, about an eighth part of lime, and a twentieth of soda. CALLINGTON. THE EDITOR. Neither Mr. Hals nor Mr. Tonkin notice this parish. It is appended to tbe parish of Southill. The name is pronounced Kelliton in the immediate neighbourhood. Callington is situated in the hundred of East, having Southill and Stoke Climsland on the north ; Calstock on the east; St. Mellior and St. Dominick to south; and St. Ive to the West. The town is said to have sent members to Parliament so early as the reign of Henry III., when the privileges of markets and fairs were granted ; but the first authen tic return was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In the time of Henry 111. the manor and lordship of Callington were vested in the family of Ferrers, by a grant from the earls of Cornwall; the possession has passed by heiresses to several families ; and finally, through Dennis, Rolle and Walpole, to Mr. George William Trefusis of Trefusis, in Milor; together with the barony in fee of Clinton, created by a writ directed John de Clinton, 17 Edward I. a.d. 1299- His grand son sold the property to Mr. Alexander Baring, at a period when some adventitious circumstances, no longer"], [196, "152 CALLINGTON. in existence, added materially to its value.

BOASE The north-eastern part of this parish extends to the east of Kitt Hill, the most elevated point of Hingston Downs, which is composed of granite. The slate ad joining thereto resembles that which occurs in similar situations in the parishes of St. Austell and St. Blazey ; and this district has been the scene of considerable mining speculations. In former ages it abounded in stream tin to such an amount that the Cornishmen of those days expressed their opinion of its value by the distich Hengstcn Down, well yrought Is worth London town, dear ybought. Carew, Lord Dunstanvitle's Edition, p. 272. As the town of Callington is approached, the slate becomes of a darker blue, and passes into hornblend rock, which prevails in the other parts of the parish, and in several places so much abounds in quartz as to form barren downs. This rock, however, has not any marked character, and it is not often exposed to view ; near St. Ive it appears to graduate into the calcareous series."], [197, "153 CALSTOCK. CALSTOCK. HALS. Calstock is situate in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north Stoke Clemsland, west Kellaton, south St. Dominick, east the Tamar river. The rectory of Calstock church seems to be extant before Domesday Tax, since it passed then by that name, and hath never admitted of any change of name or al teration since, and was undoubtedly founded and en dowed by the Earls of Cornwall, out of their manor of Calstock, wherein it is situate ; and the Duke of Corn wall, or the King, in that right, are still patrons thereof.

It appears from the ancient survey of the Duchy of Cornwall in the Exchequer, and Blount's Tenures from thence, p. 122, that the tenants of this manor had granted them, by the Earls or Dukes thereof, its lords, the liberty of free fishing on the Tamar river, in his verbis : \" Nativi tenentes de Calstock, in comitatu Cor nubi\u00e6, reddunt per annum de certo redditu, vocato Berbiagium, sine barbague, ad le Hoke-day, 19*. 6d.\" Now barbague, barbagyu, is, in Cornish, a bearded or barbed spear, such as is commonly used for killing salmons in the Tamar and other rivers. [See Stoke- Clemsland.] The salmon wear, here built over the Tamar, is, by lease from the Duke of Cornwall, in pos session of Sir John Carew, baronet, and hath formerly been set for 120/. per annum.

Cuthill, in this place, I take it was the most ancient seat of the knightly family of Edgecombes in Cornwall, and is still in their possession ; and here lived Sir Ri chard Edgecombe, knight, that assisted Henry the Se venth against Richard the Third, who was bountifully rewarded for his services by that prince. TONKIN has merely transcribed from Hals. THE EDITOR. Calstock, or Calstoke, has of late become a mining parish on an extensive scale. The manor having been sold by the Duchy for the redemption of Land Tax, has ultimately become the property of Mr. John Williams, one ofthe most skilful and successful miners in Cornwall. Cotehele is preserved by Lord Mount Edgecombe as a faithful representative of what were the residences of country gentlemen or barons in the ancient acceptation of that word. \"It came,\" says Lysons, \"into the possession ofthe Edgecombe family, by the marriage of Hilaria, daugh ter and heir of William de Cotehele, with William de Edgecombe, in the reign of Edward III. After this marriage, Cotehele became for a while the chief resi dence of the Edgecombe family.\" Carew, speaking of this place, says, \" the buildings are ancient, large, strong, and fayre, and appurtenanced with the necessaries of wood, water, fishing, park, and mills, with the devotion of (in times past) a rich-furnished chapel, and with the charity of almshouses, for certain poor people, whom the owners used to relieve.\" The beauty of its situation, the river and ancient ponds, united with the antiquities of the place, render Cotehele one of the most curious and worthy of atten tion in the West of England ; and the following descrip-"], [199, "155 CALSTOCK. tion, taken in 1830 by an architectural correspondent of the Gentleman's Magazine, is therefore extracted from that miscellany for 1833. \"There is a singularity about this Mansion, which requires to be accounted for. It cannot claim an origin in very remote antiquity, the earliest parts being not older than the reign of Henry the Seventh ; yet the nar rowness of the windows and other openings, and the tower above the gateway, would lead to the idea that it was built in an early insecure period. This, I think, may be accounted for from the fact that the builder, Sir Richard Edgecombe, had encountered personal danger in the wars of the Roses, and probably erected his mansion in the early part of the reign of Henry the Seventh, so soon after the conclusion of the conflict, that he might be impressed with the fear that the reign of the newly enthroned monarch might not be more peaceable than that of his predecessors, and he adopted under these im pressions the style which the mansion now displays. \" The house is quadrangular, with a court-yard in the centre; and, like the generality of the mansions of an tiquity, has the appendage of a hall and chapel. It is built of moor-stone in irregular courses, though some of the blocks are exceedingly large. The west front is not imposing, from the want of height, which detracts from its general appearance. The entrance is not in the centre, and is only wide enough for foot passengers; it consists of an obtuse pointed arch, slightly moulded with foliage on the spandrils, which is inclosed within another of larger dimensions with a weather cornice, and on the space between the two is a blank shield accom panied by two bold leaves. The windows are situated high in the wall; they are of small dimensions, being in fact little more than enlarged loopholes. The chimneys are square, having caps formed with coping stones. Above the entrance is a tower of a cubical form, with an embattled parapet. On entering the court through"], [200, "156 CALSTOCK. the gateway, the Hall is seen in the front, and near it, on the west side of the quadrangle, the lantern window of the Chapel. \" The interior of the Hall is very interesting. The roof is timber, and arched; and on the walls hang va rious pieces of armour and weapons of considerable an tiquity, with a complete suit of armour, which is pro bably not older than the Civil wars. In the end walls are apertures in the shape of a quatrefoil, which admit a view of the hall from adjacent apartmenls, and would allow the motions of persons assembled in it to be watched. There are some specimens of ancient furniture in the hall; in particular a chair having the date 1627. In the windows are several armorial shields in stained glass. CHAPEL AT COTEHELE. \"The Chapel projects from the western side of the mansion. It is small and neat, and has a small bell tower. The square window in the west end is unglazed ; the aperture being secured by wide bars; but allowing"], [201, "157 CALSTOCK. any person standing on the outside to see the all ar. At the distance of a few feet from the door lies an ancient font, 19 inches square by 14 inches deep; it is formed of a block of moorstone, and panelled at the sides. The interior of this chapel is approached from the mansion by the hall, to which it communicates through a small room. The roof is timber, ribbed and panelled ; and coved in the form of an obtuse arch. In the south win dow St. Anne and St. Katherine are represented in painted glass. The altar is oak, with upright panels, having quatrefoil heads. An ancient altar cloth is pre served in the house; it is formed of red velvet powdered with fleur-de-lis, and the part which was shown when it was laid on the altar, had a crucifix in the centre, ac companied by the twelve apostles in rich embroidery, and the arms of Edgecombe. \"The limit of a single visit would not allow me to particularize the various articles of furniture contained in the mansion. In the drawing-room the screen to the doorway appears to be of the date of the building ; on the door itself are roses in lozenges. The bedroom, called King Charles's, has a fine ancient state bed, with a profusion of carved work about it; and a steel mirror. The dog-inns, some of which are probably as old as the mansion, remain in the fire-places. Two chairs com memorate a visit from King George the Third and Queen Charlotte in 1789- \" In the grounds i\u00a7 another chapel, which derives its interest from the circumstance of its having been erected by Sir Richard Edgecombe in commemoration of his escape from his pursuers by concealment near the spot. It is much injured by modern alterations made in 1769, and externally retains little of its original features. In the interior are several ancient paintings, which pro bably formed the decorations of an ancient altar-piece ; when entire, it represented the Annunciation. In the east window are St. George, and a female saint with a"], [202, "158 CALSTOCK. sword, in painted glass, and several coats of arms. There is also an ancient painting of the monument of the founder of the chapel, who was buried in the convent ual church of Morlaix in Bretagne, in September 1489; and a carvinar in wood of St. Thomas a Becket.\" It is a curious circumstance in the history of Corn wall, that several of tbe principal gentlemen from this remote county, took active parts on either side between King Richard the Third and his antagonist Henry the Seventh : many were present at the battle of Bosworth. Mr. Carew relates (p. 269, Lord Dunstanville's edi tion) the almost miraculous escape of Sir Richard Edge combe of Cotehele, when he was pursued (as I appre hend) by Bodrigar, who, in his turn, found himself obliged to fly after the defeat of King Richard ; and his property was divided between Edgecumbe and Trevanion, with whom a large part of it still remains. The river from Cotehele to New Bridge exhibits a mag nificence of scenery very rarely to be found : the cliffs on the east and north-eastern bank affording here the steep and bold scarpment, as in all other similar situa tions throughout the country. Harewood, in this parish, although in the different style of a modern seat, almost rivals Cotehele: this spa cious and elegant house was built almost fortv years ago by Mr. Foot ; but the place was sold after his decease, and it is now the property and residence of Mr. William Salusbury Trelawney, heir of that ancient and distin guished family. Mr. Trelawney married Miss Carpen ter, of Mount Toby, near Tavistock, and now (1833) represents the eastern division of Cornwall in Parlia ment. Sandhill is another handsome seat in this parish, oc cupied by Mr. Williams, who, since his purchase of the manor, has improved the waste lands, planted such elevated or steep portions as were unfit for agriculture, and in every way contributed to the prosperity of the place and of its inhabitants."], [203, "159 CALSTOCK.

The Geological structure of this parish is precisely similar to that of Callington ; but, as it is better deve loped, it will admit of a little more detail. The northern part consists of the granite of Hingston Down, which is crystalline, and it is extensively quarried for economical purposes. The quarries near the summit of Kitt Hill afford excellent illustrations of the internal structure of the granitic mass. On this Down, beds of fine-grained granite project here and there above the surface, resembling that which occurs as Elvan courses in the adjacent slate. The latter rock consists of a basis of granular felspar, spotted and spangled with a shining mineral like mica. This slate, as well as the granite, have been long explored for tin and copper. Shorl and mica generally abound in the lodes ; and the former mi neral is often so intimately combined with the quartz, as to form a dark-coloured compact shorl rock. South ward the slate becomes more blue, and is fissile into ex tended slabs. Near the village of Calstock it is soft and lamellar, having evidently graduated into the calcareous series. At Cotehele, near the landing place, a beautiful oved-coloured calcareous schist is quarried, which is said to prove a good material for lining kilns and ovens : it has a shining talcose appearance, resembling that of Trenalt, near Pallephant, in Alternon."], [204, "160 CAMBORNE. Nearly opposite to the Rectory, built by Bishop Black bourn, and pleasantly situated on the river, may be seen the debouch of a canal from Tavistock, with an inclined plane, descending into the Tamar. This canal, in one part of its line, passes through a hill at the depth of seventy fathoms. CAMBORNE. HALS. Camborne is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath upon the east Redruth, north Illugan, west Gwy nier, south Crowan. For its modern name, Camborne, which was not extant at the time of the Norman Con quest, signifies a crooked or arched burne, or well.

TONKIN has merely copied from Mr. Hals. THE EDITOR. Camborne has risen more rapidly into wealth and im portance than any other parish in Cornwall. The church tower is so large and well-built, and it possesses with a market so many appendages of a regular town, that the prefix church may well be omitted. Pendarves was given by Mrs. Percevall, surviving sis ter of Sir William Pendarves, to Mr. John Stackhouse, second son of Doctor William Stackhouse, Rector of St. Amao, who married Miss Williams, heiress of that branch of the Williamses of Probus, which had settled at Trehane. Mr. John Stackhouse married Miss Acton, with whom he acquired a very large property in Shrop shire: his son, Mr. Edward William Wynne Pendarves is now the proprietor. Pendarves has become a very handsome seat in consequence of the successive im provements made by the late Mr. Stackhouse and him self.

Mr. Pendarves has followed the examples of his two immediate predecessors, by marrying a considerable heiress, Miss Triste, from Devonshire. He has been twice elected member for the county, and now (1833) repre sents the western division of Cornwall. Menadarva was purchased by the late Mr. Basset, and belongs to his son, Lord Dunstanville. Rosewarne was the residence of Mr. William Harris, who greatly increased his fortune by skill and success in mining. He served the office of sheriff in 1773. His only daughter and heiress is married to Mr. Winchcornbe Hartley, a gentleman of Berkshire. Crane, with several adjoining farms, became the pro perty of Mr. John Oliver Willyams, of Carnanton, in right of his mother, and the whole, on his demise, was purchased by Lord Dunstanville. I cannot close my short additions to Camborne with out noticing Mr. Richard Trevithick. No one, with the exception of Mr. Watt, has probably contributed in so great a degree to the improvement of steam-engines, the most important and the most philosophical of all mechanical inventions. His enterprise has also equalled the abstract powers of his mind, and for several years he laboured in South America to give the mines of that great continent the advantage of European machinery; but civil wars, and the instability of Governments, de feated his best endeavours, so as to render them, up to the present time, unavailing either to those mines or to himself.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The eastern and south-western sides of this parish are situate on granite, the greater part consisting of high and barren hills, including Carnbrea and Carnkie. This rock is large-grained, and not very prone to disintegrate; it is occasionally traversed by beds of felspar porphyry. On the boundaries of this granite, and in the adjacent slate, are numerous tin and copper-mines, the most in teresting of which are Delcoath and Cock's Kitchen ; the latter extends into tbe parish of Illogan, but is a continuation of the Camborne lodes. Delcoath has been for many years the deepest mine in Cornwall. It stands at the surface, about fist)' fathoms (300 feet) above the level of the sea, and the deepest shaft is about a hundred and eighty fathoms (1080 feet) below the sea level, making on the whole a depth from the surface of nearly 1 400 feet. These mines exhibit the curious geological pheno mena of alternating granite and slate ; that is, in sinking a perpendicular shaft, the miner passes repeatedly out of one of these rocks into the other. Various theoretical opinions have been entertained on this subject : some geologists supposing that the layers are no more than irregular protuberances from tbe main mass ofthe rock; whilst others consider them as large veins dipping to wards and communicating with the granite at a great depth. But it is ascertained that these granite layers are sometimes detached or insulated masses, whilst at other times they form large veins or courses, which have regular bearings to a considerable distance, and are then called elvans ; to form, however, a correct idea of the features of these phenomena, we must be come acquainted, not with the appearance only, but with the nature and composition of these two rocks. Granite and slate are usually considered, from their exterior character, as very dissimilar, whereas in this situation their real composition is nearly alike."], [210, "166 CAMBORNE. The granite immediately in contact with the slate, consists of compact felspar, containing particles or crys tals of felspar, quartz, and mica, in variable proportions, but the whole generally increasing towards the centre of the mass. So that the granite is changed into a felspar rock or porphyry rock, scarcely ever resembling a well characterised granite ; while the slate in contact has received the various names of greyvvacke, greenstone, clayslate, and killas; but it appears to be a rock sui generis, consisting almost entirely of compact felspar, coloured purple or blue by its intimate union with a dark-coloured micaceous mineral, sometimes seen dis tinct on the surface of tbe slate, and from which it ap pears to derive its lamellar structure. The bases of these two rocks are therefore the same, and at the point of contact it is often difficult to draw a line between them ; for the slate passes into white compact felspar by the gradual disappearance of its colouring mineral; and this granite rock, by the more and more additions of felspar, quartz, and mica, reassumes its usual character. On this view ofthe subject, it is easy to comprehend why the granite and the slate alternate and mutually pass into each other; and an explanation may also be given ofthe complicated phenomena of granite veins in slate, when it is assumed that both rocks are not only of contemporaneous origin, but likewise similar in their mineral composition. Between this mining district and a line drawn east and west across the parish, a little north of tbe church town, the land is in most places very good ; but north of this line, at the extremity of the parish, where it abuts on the sea, the ground is almost entirely uncultivated, af fording nothing more than a slight pasturage for sheep. At Godrevy Point there is laid open an interesting sec tion of diluvial deposits: one of the beds, composed of shelly sand and pebbles, is consolidated with sandstone and conglomerate."], [211, "167 CARDINHAM. HALS. Cardinham is situate in the hundred of West, and hath upon the north Blisland, Temple, and part of Altarnun ; south, Bradock and Warleggan ; west, Bodmin. For the name, it is compounded of those par ticles, car-din-ham, id est, the rock-man's-home or habitation; also car-dyn-an, i.e. the rock man, or a man that dwells upon, or has his residence amongst rocks, or in a rocky country, with which sort of inani mate creatures the north part of this parish aboundeth. It takes its denomination from the manor and barton of old Cardinham ; as from thence did its lord and owner Robert de Cardinan, temp. Richard I., the same gen tleman mentioned in Mr. Carew's \" Survey of Cornwall,\" that by the tenure of knight-service held in those parts seventy-one knight's fees; which undoubtedly then was the greatest estate pertaining to any private man in this province. He was not only the founder and endower of the Alien Priory of St. Andrew at Tywardreth, (of which more in that place,) but also of this rectory church. By the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Win chester into the value of benefices in Cornwall, as aforesaid, 1294, Ecclesia de Cardinan in Decanatu de Westwellshire, was rated 6/. 8s. Ad. In Wolsey's In quisition, 1521, and Valor Beneficiorum, 24/. 17s. 6d., by the name of the Rectory of Cardenham, synony mous with Cardinham.

And here it must be observed, that there was no such parish or church extant at the time of the Norman conquest as Cardinham ; for in the Domesday Rate, 1087, 20 William I., this division passed then under the"], [212, "168 CARDINHAM. districts of Cabulian, Dovenot, and Glin, (see the Domesday Catalogue); but after the building and endowing of this church, Glin was converted into Cardinham parish, and Cabulian into Warliggon ; un der which name and title they have hitherto passed, as members thereof. I find it much controverted amongst antiquaries and historians, whether the Dyn hams, that afterwards became possessed of this manor and barton, were the descendants of this Robert de Cardinan, or not ; some averring one thing and some another; but certain I am they were possessed thereof as his heirs and assigns ; but whether denominated from thence, or the local places of Dynhain in St. Menvor, or Dinham-bridge in St. Kew, I know not. Nevertheless, contrary to both those conjectures, Mr. Camden tells us that those Dinbams were a French tribe that came into England with William the Con queror; particularly one Oliver de Dinant, one of whose sons, viz. Galfrid de Dinham, temp. Henry H. was a great augmenter of the Abbey of Hartland; and changed the secular priests founded there by Githa, wife of Earl Godwin, into Black Canons Augustine. See Monasticon Anglicanum, in Devon. One Oliver de Dinant, or Dinham, was by writ of summons called to Parliament as a Baron, 24 Edward 1. who had issue Josce, who had issue John, who had issue John, who had issue John, who had issue John ; who were all knighted ; which last John had issue, by Sir Richard Arche's heir, John Dinham, of Old Car denham, Esq., sheriff of Devon, 59 Henry VL, 1460, who then resided at his barton of Nutwell, in Wood berry parish, eight miles from Exeter, who at that time made use of his authority in promoting the safety of the Duke of York's friends, viz. the Earls of March, Salisbury, and Warwick, and others, then attainted of treason by Act of Parliament, who, in order to the preservation of their lives, fled into Devonshire,"], [213, "169 CARDINHAM. where they were concealed by the said John Dinham at Nutwell aforesaid, till he had opportunities from Exmouth to convey them to Guernsey, from whence they were transported to Calais, which place they secured for the Duke of York. But as soon as King Henry and the Parliament understood thereof, im mediately the Duke of Somerset was dispatched with a commission to be governor of that place; who no sooner approached the harbour of Calais with bis ships, but those fugitive lords ordered the train of artillery at Rysbank (there) immediately to be fired upon the Duke of Somerset and his companions, as they were coming on shore, which so obstructed their design that they were forced, with some damage and loss, to return to their ships, weigh anchor, spread sails, and bear off for the English coast, and dropped anchor safely at Sandwich in Kent ; from whence King Henry and Queen Margaret had some notice from the Duke of Somerset of the affront offered his Majesty and him at Calais, whereupon the King ordered his navy royal, as soon as possible, to be in readiness to attend and assist him, in order to reduce Calais to his obedience. But, alas ! maugre those contrivance, the said John Dynham, before the King's navy could be provided and got together, out of affection to the Duke of York, the Earl of March and his confederates, like a daring, valiant, courageous, and invincible hero, as he was, with a small company of armed men, boarded the Earl of Somerset's ships in the harbour of Sandwich, and therein took the Lord Rivers, designed for his admiral against Calais, and by a strong hand carried him and all his ships thither; and then, with the same ships, conveyed the Earl of March and his friends from Calais to the Duke of York his father, then fled into Ireland. After the restoration of the House of York to the crown, in the person of Edward IV. we find this John Dynham was knighted. In the 6th Edward IV. he was"], [214, "170 CARDINHAM. by writ summoned to Parliament as a Baron thereof, by the name of John Dinham, Baron Dinham, of Cardin- ham. In the 9th Edward IV. he obtained a grant ofthe custody of the forest of Dartmoor, the manor and borough of Lidford, and the manor of South Teign in Devon, during his life, under the yearly rent of 100 marks, and 6s. 8d. ; and soon after he got a grant of the office of steward of the honours, castles, manors, and boroughs of Plympton, Oakhampton, Tiverton, Samp- ford Courtney, and some others, and was made Knight of the Garter; and in tbe first yearof Henry VII., 1485, he was by letters patent created Baron Dinham, of Cardinham ; afterwards he was made Lord High Trea- surer of England, which office he held fifteen years, and died 17 Henry VII. aged seventy-two years. He left issue Charles Dinham, Esq. his son and heir, sheriff of Devon, 16 Edward IV., 1476, that married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Lord Fitzwalter, who died without issue ; by reason whereof his four sisters became his heirs, and were married, Jane, to Baron Zouch, ofTotness; Joan, to Lord Arundell, of Lanherne, knight ; Marga ret, to Nicholas Baron Carew, of Molesford, in Berk shire; and Elizabeth, to Foulk Bourchier, of Tavistock, Lord Fitzwarren. The arms of Dinham were, in a field Gules, three fusils in fess Argent, within a border Ermine ; but Nicholas Upton, in his manuscript of heraldry, 1440, written before the invention of printing, tells us, Monsieur Oliver de Dinham port de Goules un fess engrelle de Ermine, un bordure endentee Argent. The Lady Elizabeth Dinham, widow of the Lord Fitzwarren aforesaid, after his death, was married to Thomas Shapcott, of Elton, in Huntingdonshire, Esq., where, at her own proper cost and charge, she erected a private chapel to the honour of Almighty God, of that curious and costly workmanship, both in walls, roof, and window, that it is worthy the admiration of all beholders, and parallel to, if not superior, to any other s*"], [215, "171 CARDINHAM. church or chapel of its bigness in England. See Cam den in Huntingdonshire. Nicholas Baron Carew aforesaid, together with his lady, were buried in Westminster Abbey, amongst the kings and queens of England, as appears from a grey marble tomb-stone, with a brass inscription round it, containing, as I remember, these words. Orate pro animabus Nicolai Baronis quondam de Carew, et Domin\u00e6 Margaret\u00e6 uxoris ejus, fili\u00e6 Johan nis Domini Dinham, Militis ; qui quidem Nicholaus obiit sexto die mensis Decembris, anno Dom. 1470; et predicta Domina Margareta obiit die mensis Decem bris, anno 1471. Of this famous family Mr. Carew, in his \" Survey of Cornwall,\" hath only these words : \" formerly at Cardinham lived the Lord Dinham.\" Glin, Glynn, in this parish, is a name taken and given from the ancient natural circumstances of the place, where lakes, pools,- and rivers of water abound, and groves of trees, or copps, flourish and grow; de rived from the Japhetical Greek \\ifivri, [limnee] lacus ; under which name, and devyock, or deynock district, part of the now parish of Cardinham, was taxed 20 William I., 1087. From which place was denomi nated an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed De Glynn, who for many generations flourished there in worshipful degree, till about the time of Henry VII., when tbe sole daughter and heir of this family was married to Carmynow of Resprin, or Polmaugan, whose heir being married to Courtney, brought this barton of Glynn into that family ; by some of whose posterity it was sold to a younger branch of this family of Glynn, who thereby was restated therein, and so became pos sessed thereof ; from whom was lineally descended Nicholas Glynn, Esq. Member of Parliament for Bod min, temp. Charles II., who married one of the coheirs of Dennis, of Orleigh, in Devon, as did Sir Thomas Hamson, Knt., of Buckinghamshire, the other; who"], [216, "172 CARDINHAM. had issue Denny Glynn, Esq. that married two wives, Foow- of Tiverton, and Hoblyn of Bodman ; who had issue William Glynn, Esq., that married Prideaux of Padstow, and giveth for his arms, in a field Argent, a chevron between three salmon-spears Sable ; alluding to their custom, privilege, or right of hunting or fishing for salmons in the Fowey river, passing through this barton or lordship of Glynn towards the sea. Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us this place is called Glvnford, by reason of a bridge or pass over the Fowey River there; for ford in British signifies a street, road, pass, or highway over waters ; but the authority of Domesday Roll aforesaid, which calls it Glin, plainly shows that this latter appellation, ford, was added to this word Glynn after the bridge aforesaid was erected, and not otherwise to be applied. Nicholas Glynn, of Glyn-ford, Esq. was sheriff of Cornwall 18 James I. Devynock, as aforesaid, was another district now in this parish, taxed in Domesday Roll, now in possession of Bann, Gent. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least curiosity that differs from Hals. He ends indeed by saying, that \" nothing can be more ridiculous than Mr. Hals's derivation ofthe name of this parish.\" THE EDITOR. It is much to be wished that some one learned in the Celtic language, perhaps a native of Britany, would investigate the derivations of all the names of places, of hills, and of rivers, after visiting their localities. Car, in composition, is probably the same as cairn or kairn a rock, and din is a fortress ; but these do not seem likely to take up the Saxon termination ham, an house or dwelling."], [217, "173 CARDINHAM. Glynn has not, in all probability, any connection with the Saxon words gline or glen. A word of very similar sound in one of the Celtic dialects denominates a spear, and this agrees with the family arms, which are Argent, the heads of three fishing-spears or tridents, with their points downwards, two and one, Sable. A new house was built at Glynn by Mr. Edmund John Glynn, son of Serjeant Glynn, distinguished in the political dissensions of Mr. Wilkes. The house was accidentally consumed by fire before the whole interior had been completed. The walls, however, were not much injured, and the building will probably be re stored. It is now the property of the Right Hon. Gen. Sir Hussey Vivian. Serjeant Glynn succeeded to his elder brother's son, a young man said to be possessed of considerable abilities and even learning, but of such singular and eccentric habits, that he remained for years without speaking a single word, communicating his thoughts by writing. A verdict of lunacy was at last obtained against him at the Cornwall Assizes, but much to the general dissatisfaction of the country, as interested motives were readily imputable to the uncle ; and his mother felt so strongly on the subject, that being heiress of an ancient family, Nicholls of Trewane in St. Kew, she devised nearly the whole of her posses sions, in honour of her son's name, to Mr. Glynn of Heliton ; probably ofthe same slock, but very distantly related.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. A continuation of the granite of Blisland and St. Breward forms the north-eastern corner of this parish. A belt then succeeds, which appears to be of the same kind as the micaceous slate of St. Breward already de scribed ; it may be traced along the side of the Les keard road in a disintegrated state. On leaving this road and proceeding towards the church, the rock be comes more argillaceous, as round Bodmin, and the land improves in quality. The western and southern parts of the parish consist of barren downs, reposing on rocks which abound in quartz. ST. CLEEK. HALS. St. Cleer is situate in the hundred of West, and hath upon the north, Altarnun ; south, Liskeard; east, St. Tew; west, St. Neot. The modern name of this parish was not extant at the time of the Norman Conquest, but probably then passed in the Domesday tax under the titles of Trelven, Niveton, or Trethac. At the time ofthe Pope's inquisition into the value of Cornish be nefices, in order to his Annats, 1294, Ecclesia de Sancto Claro, in Decanatu de Westwellshire, was charged ten marks; Vicar ejusdem 40s. In Wolsey's Inquisition, 1521, and Valor Beneficiorum, 19/. 16s. 8d. and the parish rated to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1696, 241/. 17s. The name of this parish is taken from the church, and the church's name from the titular guardianess thereof, to whom the same is dedicated, viz. St. Clare"], [219, "175 ST. CLEER. orCleer; whose name is derived from the Latin word claro, i. e. clear, bright, shining, transparent; and she herself was born of an honourable lineage at the city of Assisum in Italy. [Mr. Hals here gives a long history of St. Clare, much more in detail than is suited to a parochial history. It may be sufficient to add, she was the daughter of Phavorino Sciffo, a noble knight, and of Hortulana, his most virtuous wife, and born in the year 1193. St. Francis was then alive and at the height of his fame. St. Dominic and St. Francis, as is well known, in stituted the two great orders of begging monks or friars. Those who entered into any of the previously existing monastic establishments, underwent what was termed a civil death, renounced all individual property, bestowing what was at their own disposal in any way most agreeable to themselves, and suffering what was inalienable to descend to their heirs. Hence has origi nated the expression natural life, as opposed to civil life, still used in legal proceedings. But St. Dominic and St. Francis, not content with this individual po verty, extended it to their orders ; so that with the ex ception of a dwelling, some furniture, and necessary raiment, their friars were to live, as the cynics had done of old, upon the accidental charity of victuals given in kind and from da}' to day; for a broad and impassable boundary was drawn between receiving bread from the donor's hand, and a piece of metal for which that bread might be procured ; in the same manner as any portion ofthe increase arising from flocks or herds might law fully be given ; whilst anathemas were thundered against him who accepted the least return for valu able commodity, in exchange for which similar flocks or herds could easily and freely be procured. As impassioned harangues were obviously the most efficient agents for eliciting or extorting these daily"], [220, "176 ST. CLEER. alms, they were incessantly employed ; so that the men dicants soon acquired the distinctive appellation of preaching friars; and the whole institution being suited to the genius, the spirit, and the prejudices of the rude age in which it arose, the Dominicans and Franciscans acquired and maintained, during some centuries, almost the temporal sovereignty of Europe; till their dissen sions, the scandalous immorality growing out of their vagrant lives, and the diffusion of knowledge, dissolved the charm. This contagion readily extended itself to females, so that, with some indispensible modifications, societies soon arose of women bound by the same rule of individual and collective poverty. St. Clare appears to have been the first female disciple of St. Francis, or at least the first raised by him to eminence and power, acquisitions far more captivating to the human mind, than wealth with all its passive luxuries and enjoyments. St. Clare had the gratification of eloping from her parents to receive the veil and the tonsure from the hands of St. Francis, who placed her at first in a mo nastery of Benedictine Nuns; but the young saint soon found herself in the situation of an abbess, with her mother and two sisters members of the community, submitted to her sway. From this station she advanced to be the founder of an order, having numerous houses established under her supreme authority, exercised ac cording to rules dictated by St. Francis; and the poor Clares constitute a principal branch of the female mo nastic establishments existing in all Catholic countries up to the present times. Pope Innocent IV. made a journey on purpose to visit Clare, not long before her death in 1253, and again to assist at her funeral. His successor, Pope Alexan der IV. two years afterwards, inscribed her name in tbe celestial canon. Mr. Hals then proceeds to parti culars.]"], [221, "177 ST. CLEER. In this parish is yet to be seen a famous chapel Well, dedicated to St. Clare, a work of great skill, labour, and cost, though now much decayed, which formerly per tained to some nunnery of those sort of religious wo men extant here or at Leskeard. (See Truro and Ken wyn, for Clares.) From this parish was denominated an ancient family of gentlemen, surnamed de St. Cleare, from whence are descended the St. Clears of Tudwell, in Devon, who, suitable to their name, give for their arms, in a field Azure the sun in its glory shining or transparent ; of which tribe was that Robertus de Sancto Claro, qui tenet decem libratas terr\u00e6, in hundredo de Mertock, in comit. Somerset, de domine rege in capite, perservicium inveniendi unum servientem armatum cum uno equo in exercitu domini regis in Wallia per xl. dies sumptibus suis propriis. (Pleas of the Crown in Scaccario, 8 Edward I.) In this parish is Tre-worg-y, the mansion of John Conock, Esq., that married Burgoigne ; his father Heale and Courtney ; and giveth for his arms, Argent, a fess dancette between three spread eagles Gules. The name Conock or Connock signifies rich, pros perous, thriving, successful, of which name and family those in Cornwall are descended from the Conocks of Wiltshire, and the first propagator of this tribe in those parts was one Mr. Conock, who in the time of Queen Elizabeth came to Leskeard town a tanner, and in that occupation got much riches, and laid the foundation of his estate, as Mr. Thomas River, of Liskeard, informed me. Tre-mabe, in this parish, id est, the son's town, viz. a place in former ages by some father given as the dwell ing to his son, was formerly the lands of Samuel Lang ford, Gent, that married Cary of Clovelly. Tre-wor-oc, also Tre-wor-ock, the town on a lake, was formerly the lands of Trubody, who sold the same to N"], [222, "178 ST. CLEER. Jackman, now in possession thereof. In the church on seats or pews, pertaining to those Trubodys, I have seen this inscription, Nati honoris; in what sense to be construed is mystery to me, since I have not under stood that any of this tribe was either a son nobly born, or inherited to any kind of honour, dignity, or promo tion. At Pennant in this parish, id est, the head of the valley, or the valley head, in the open downs by the high road or street-way, formerly stood a large flat moor-stone, about eight feet long, in perpendicular man ner, described by Mr. Carew and Mr. Camden, wherein is still to be seen on the one side thereof this inscription, in Roman Saxon letters, then in use when it was set up, containing these words: bomej-c j-ojaiuc pj-o anima. [Instead ofthe long and uninteresting account given by Mr. Hals of this monument, I will take the liberty of substituting an extract from Mr. Bond's Topogra phical and Historical Sketches of the Boroughs of East and West Looe, printed by J. Nichols and Son, Par liament Street, in 1823, which will be found of a very different description. \" Not far from Dosmery Pool may be seen a curious heap of rocks, called Wiring Cheese or Cheese Wring; and, at a short distance therefrom, an artificial curiosity called the Hurlers, and another called the Other-half stone. \"Camden, in his Britannia, speaking of St. Neot's parish, says, ' Near unto this, as I have heard, within the parish of St. Cleer, there are to be seen, in a place called Pennant, that is, the head of the vale, two mo numents of stone; of which the one in the upper part is wrought hollow, in manner of a chair; the other, named Other-halfe-stone, hath an inscription of barba rous characters, now in a manner worn out,' which he thinks should be read thus: doniert rogavit pro"], [223, "179 ST. CLEER. anima. As for this Doniert, Camden thinks he was that prince of Cornwall whom the chroniclers name Dungerth, and record that he was drowned in the year of our salvation 872. Camden also says, ' Hard by there is a number of good big rockes heaped up toge ther ; and under them one stone of a lesser size, fa shioned naturally in form of a cheese, so as it seemeth to be pressed like a cheese ; whe.eupon it is named Wring Cheese. Many other stones besides, in some sort four-square, are to be seen upon the plain adjoin ing; of which seven or eight are pitched upright of equal distances asunder. The neighbouring inhabitants term them Hurlers, as being by a devout and godly error persuaded, they had been men sometime trans formed into stones, for profaning the Lord's day with hurling the ball. Others would have it to be a trophy (as it were) or a monument in memorial of some battle. And some think verily they were set as mere stones or landmarks; as having read in those authors that wrote on limits, that stones were gathered together of both parties, and the same erected for bounders. In this coast the river Loo maketh way and runneth into the sea, and in his very mouth giveth name to two little towns joined with a bridge together.' \"On the 6th August, 1802, I went with a party of friends to see these natural and artificial curiosities, mentioned by Camden. I first got the party to Red gate,* in St. Cleer parish, about four miles from Lis keard, in order to find out Doniert or Dungerth's monu ment, which I understood was somewhere near to it. I made inquiry at the house at Red-gate after this monu ment, but could get no account of it for some time, * Probably this place took its name not from a gate painted red being there placed, as is generally imagined, but from its being situated just above Fowey fiver ; Rhie-gat signifies River's course. The Fowey river at this place is not above half a mile from the source of Looe river. N 2"], [224, "180 ST. CLEER. though I questioned in a variety of ways ; at last, how ever, we got information where it was situated. It is about a quarter of a mile off from Red-gate, eastward, in a field next the high road. We got into this field, and seeing an erect stone went towards it, and found it to be the monument we sought. One moorstone stands erect, and the other with the inscription on it, lies in a pit close by. The figures of these stones in Borlase's History are most like them of any I have seen.* I made out and copied the inscription very perfectly, by rubbing a soft stone which left its mark in the letters. DONI 6RT: RO GKUIT PRO KN IOOS I \"This stone by recollection is about two feet wide at top, and about five or six feet in length. And the other stone, which still stands erect, and ornamented with cross lines, &c. is about the same in height. * The following account of these stones is copied from Mr. Polwhele's Cornwall, vol. ii. p. 195. \" In the parish of St. Clere, about 200 paces to the eastward of Redgate, aie two monumental stones which seem parts of two different crosses. They have no such relation to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they ever con tributed to form one monument. One is inscribed ; the other, without an in scription, called 'the other half stone,' seems to have been the shaft ofj> cross, and originally stood upright, but has latterly been thrown down, from an idle curiosity to ascertain whether any concealed treasures were beneath its base. On one of its sides are some ornamental asterisks, but no letters of any kind. Its present length is about eight feet ; yet it seems to have been once loDger, as the upper part is broken, and displays part of a mortice. The inscribed stone, nearly square, appears to have been a plinth of a monumental cross, having the words 'Doniert rogavit pro anima' inscribed upon it, in similar characters to those used about the ninth century. Doniert is supposed to mean Dungerth, who was king of Cornwall, and accidentally drowned about the year 872. Of the mean^ ing and intention of this monument, see Borlase, pp. 361, 3G2.\""], [225, "181 ST. CLEER. \" The west front is quite plain ; the top has the remains of a kind of mortice, left hand corner broken off. The east front is dotted over, but has no letters. \" I find in Hals, that the pit in which the stone with the inscription lies, was formed in the latter end of the reign of Charles II. in consequence of his, Hals's, going there at that period with some gentlemen, to view, as he says, the, at that time thought barbarous, inscription; for some tinners in the contiguous country, taking notice of these gentlemen visiting this place, apprehended they came there in quest of some hidden treasure ; where upon, as Hals says, some of them wiser than the rest, lay their heads together, and resolved in council to be before-hand, and accordingly went with pickaxes and shovels, and opened the earth round about the monu ment, to the depth of about six feet ; when they dis covered a spacious vault walled about, and arched over with stones, having on the sides thereof two stone seats, not unlike those in churches for auricular confession. The sight of all which struck them with consternation, or a kind of horror, that they incontinently gave over search, and with the utmost hurry and dread, throwing earth and turf to fill up the pit they made, they departed, having neither of them the courage to enter or even to inspect into the further circumstances of the place ; which account Hals says, he had from the mouths of some of the very fellows themselves. Some short while after, the loose earth, by reason of some heavy rains which fell, sunk away into the vault, which occasioning also a sort of terr\u00e6-motus and concession of the earth adjoining, the said monument was at length so under mined thereby, that it fell to the ground, where it still remains. 'Would some gentlemen of ability and cu riosity, says Hals, and so say I, be at the charge of again opening and cleansing this under-ground chapel, or whatever else it may be denominated, it might probably afford matter of pleasing amusement, if"], [226, "182 ST. CLEER. not grand speculation to the learned searchers into mat ters of antiquity. \"This monument formerly went by the name of ' the other half stone.' Some translate the inscription, ' Pray for the soul of Dungerth,' others ' Doniert asked for his soul ;' and there seems to be great controversy for what purpose this monument was erected. High stones might originally, in the early ages of Christianity, have been erected near roads in desolate situations, and at short distances from each other, to direct travellers in their journies ; and crosses might have been placed on them as a memento for thanksgiving:, when the traveller had effected this part of his journey in safety. Now if the inscription on the above monument is meant for ' Pray for the soul of Dungerth,' may we not suppose that it was meant as a request to those who should hap pen to be praying for themselves, to offer up a prayer also for Dungerth, who probably caused that monu ment to be erected, or who was buried near the same, perhaps in the chapel before mentioned to have been discovered by the tinners. Or if the inscription is to be read, ' Doniert asked for his soul,' which seems the proper translation ; may we not suppose that Doniert (who by all accounts was a very pious prince) erected this stone, and prayed or asked for mercy thereat. Per haps originally these stones might have been called Ave stones, from tbe Latin word ' Ave,' all hail! God speed you ; God save you, &c. a very appropriate expression in a desolate situation to a wanderer or traveller. And the reference to another Ave stone might signify the one which is a little to the eastward of it, bearing a cross, and by its appearance formerly a legend underneath. This word Ave (pronounced in the same manner it is in Ave-Mary-Lane, London) might be corrupted into Half; so that Ave stone and Half stone might mean one and the same thing. And in Cornwall the F is very fre quently pronounced as a V, and the V as an F, at this"], [227, "183 ST. CLEER. present time.* If this does not meet approbation, I will add another conjecture. As the circle of stones called the Hurlers, are at a short distance from this monument and the cross before-mentioned, might not the monu ment and the cross be called the ' one heave stone,' and the other, ' the other or outer heave stone,' places from whence the ball during the game of hurling was thrown. The traditionary story of the stones called the hurlers, being once men turned into stone for profaning the Sab bath, will give some slight sanction to this conjecture ; and in addition, even at this time the high-cross is vul garly believed to have been the man who ran off with the ball. \" With respect to the stones called the Hurlers being once men, I will say with Hals, ' Did but the ball which these Hurlers used when flesh and blood, appear directly over them immoveably pendant in the air, one might be apt to credit some little of the tale ;' but as this is not the case, I must add my belief of their being erected by the Druids for some purpose or other, pro bably a court of justice ; long subsequent to which erection, however, they may have served as the goal for hurl players. And indeed a finer spot for such a game could not be fixed on perhaps any where. But I be lieve the Hurlers took their names from some other source than that ofthe game of hurling the ball being used there. * I take some credit to myself for this conjecture as to the original meaning of \" the other half stone.\" And 1 have, long since writing this, accidentally discovered what strongly confirms my opinion. The authors of the Beauties of England and Wales, speaking of inscribed stones at Ebchester, in Durham, say, there is one having the single word \" Have\" for Ave on it. This stone is sup posed by Horsley to be sepulchral. Have IMelitina Sanctissima. The custom of thus saluting, as it were, the dead, or taking their last farewell of them, is very well known, and it may seem almost needless to produce any instances of it. Thus \u00c6neas bids eternal adieu to Pallas : Salve \u00e6ternum mihi, maxime Palla, \u00c6ternumque vale. \u2014 \u00c6neid, XI. 97. Thus also a passage in Catullus, \u2014 Ave atque vale."], [228, "184 ST. CLEER. \" After sufficiently viewing Dungerth's monument, we directed our course towards Cheese-wring, and soon came to the Hurlers, but first we rode up to the High Cross before mentioned, which at a distance looked somewhat like a man. Under its cross it has an oblong square, as if the border of an inscription, but at present there is not the least vestige of a letter on it. Soon after we came to the Hurlers, which we found to be moorstones of about five or six feet high, forming two circles one without the other (not as represented in Hals' Parochial History, but like that in Borlase), the circle nearest Cheese-wring less than that of the other. Some of the stones are fallen down, and remain where they fell, and others have probably been carried off for gate posts and other purposes. The areas of the circles are not level, there being many pits in them, as if the earth had sunk over large graves. 1 confess I was not much struck with the appearance of these famous stones, not having faith to believe they once were men. Near this place we fell in with a man going to Cheese-wring, and were glad to follow him as a guide. Among other questions, I asked him, as we passed along, whether he could tell me the name of the tenement on which Dun gerth's monument was; he answered Pennant. I also asked him whether he knew where the source of the Looe river was; he said in a field next below Dungerth's monument. I was sorry to hear this, as we could not conveniently return to see it, but I learned from him it was a mere spring of water uninclosed. \" When we reachedCheese-wring, we discovered a man and woman on the top of the mount (on the declivity of which Cheese-wring stands), who, we afterwards found, were cutting turfs for fuel. Our guide first led us to the house ofthe late Daniel Gumb (a stone-cutter), cut by him out of a solid rock of granite (the rocks all around this place are granite, or moorstone as commonly called in Cornwall, and of the finest quality). This artificial"], [229, "ST. CLEER. 185 cavern may be about twelve feet deep and not quite so broad ; the roof consists of one flat stone of many tons weight, supported by the natural rock on one side, and by pillars of small stones on the other. How Gumb formed this last support is not easily conceived. We entered with hesitation lest the covering should be our grave-stone. On the right-hand side of the door is ' D. Gumb,' with a date engraved 1735 (or 3). On the upper part of the covering stone, channels are cut to carry off the rain, or probably to cause it to fall into a bucket for his use ; there is also engraved on it some geometrical device formed by Gumb, as our guide told us, who also said that Gumb was accounted a pretty sensible man. I have no hesitation in saying he must have been a pretty eccentric character to have fixed on this place for his habitation; but here he dwelt for seve ral years with his wife and children, several of whom were born and died here. His calling was that of a stone-cutter, and he fixed himself on a spot where ma terials could be met with to employ a thousand men for a thousand years. \"After quitting this house, we ascended a few paces to the pile of rocks called Cheese-wring, the resemblance of which is well expressed by the print in Borlase's Nat. Hist. We were all struck with astonishment at this wonderful work of nature ; we surveyed it over and over again, went round it several times, and viewed it from every part. It is about thirty-two feet high. The up permost stone I have no doubt has Druidieal basons formed in it. One of them shows itself by the edge of the stone having fallen away. After spending some time in viewing this tremendously awful pile of rocks, we ascended to the summit of the mount on the side of which it stands. This summit is surrounded by an arti ficial rampart of loose stones, not piled up; possibly they might have formed a wall, or have been carried there for building one ; for if they were placed as they"], [230, "186 ST. CLEER. now are with an intention so to remain, they could not have been very defensive to this mount. Possibly the name of Cheese-wring may be derived from this ring of stones, and not from the vulgar idea of the Cheese-wring rocks being like a cheese-press. \"The area within the rampart may be about half an acre of ground, and has rocks scattered all over it ; but in some places verdure even in this rude region makes its appearance. We found a man and a woman within the area cutting turfs between the rocks for fuel. Among other questions, I asked the man to whom the spot be longed ; his answer was, 'he believed to nobody.' \"Several curious piles of rocks, some forming crom lechs, and others of various forms and positions, are here also to be seen, and several of them have Druidieal basons on them. The rocks having these basons are the most lofty or most remarkable for shape or situation. On some rocks there are two or three basons ; and where there are more basons than one, they generally commu nicate by a channel. The basons here are of different sizes, though all of them are of the same shape, which is circular. Some of them are about a foot and a half in diameter, and six or eight inches deep; others not so large or deep. Never having seen any Druidi eal basons before, and having had my doubts till this time, whether they might not be natural pro ductions caused by rain, lightning, &,c. I was led to examine other rocks, whether they had (though equally exposed to the weather) similar formations, but could not find a bason on any rock that was not singular either for its shape or situation. I therefore concluded that these basons were the work of art, and not of nature ; and I think they were not intended for the purpose of receiving the rain for common uses, for if so, why were they not made on rocks of easy access ? It is possible, however, that rain being held in a natural hollow of a rock, may decompose that part of the rock on which it rests, and being whirled about by the wind from time to"], [231, "187 ST. CLEER. time, may form these basons which we attribute to art; and if this is the case, they must continue increasing in size and depth. Have such basons ever been seen but on granite rocks ? if not, probably water dissolves the feltspar and disunites the quartz and mica; and the winds driving round the water with particles of quartz at the bottom of the bason, must consequently fret away the rock and enlarge the bason. A rock of white marble lies on the sea beach near Looe, completely co vered with hollows like what are termed Druidieal ba sons ; these hollows in this rock I have no doubt have been formed by the sea; it lies near an insulated high rock under Sanders Lane, and is every tide co vered with the sea, and is verv frequently covered with sand. A person fancying the basons on this rock of marble to be an artificial work, might also fancy that it once was placed on top of the elevated rock near it; the contrast of the white marble on top of the elevated rock, which is of a very dark colour, would give a sin gular appearance. When this high rock is shown to strangers, they are generally told, with a serious face, that when it hears a cock crowing at Hay (which is a farm just above it) it turns round three times ! \" SHARPY TORRY. \" After leaving the area before-mentioned, we mounted our horses, and went towards another very considerable rocky eminence, about half a mile north-east ; the road to which over the Down is full of rocks and stones, so as to prevent a horse from going other than step and step at times. On our way we passed a small circle of stones, the remains I rather think of an ancient Barrow, whose earth had been washed away by the rains. We shortly after oassed another pretty large circle of stones, just about the diameter to appearance of the lesser circle of the Hurlers ; at length we arrived at the pile of rocks, called by our guide Sharpy-torry (Sharp-torr, from"], [232, "188 ST. CLEER. its conical shape). We alighted from our horses and as cended. On the north or north-west side of it there ap pears a hollow, more like a large chimney than any other thing I can compare it to; the outside of which seems to have given way, and the steep hill below is strewed with an immense quantity of rocks and large stones, as if carried down or poured out from this hollow. Whe ther this was caused by the operation of fire or water bursting from this hollow or crater, if I may use the ex pression, I will not take upon me lo say ; but that one or other of these agents burst from this mount appears to be extremely probable, for the rocks and stones seem exactly as if they had been tumbled or thrown out of this crater by a current of some kind. We could not, however, discover lava; therefore it is probable water might have burst out, unless the lava has been decom- posed. The views from this place are truly sublime. The spot is nearly the centre of the broadest part of the county ; from it we saw both seas, north and south, and consequently the intervening land; and I believe it is the only eminence (except perhaps Brownwilly) in the east- ern part of Cornwall, from whence both seas may be seen. We also saw in the North Sea a very high land, which we concluded must be Lundy Island ; but the ho- rizon to the north being rather hazy, I will not take upon me to say positively that it was that island, though it is probable to have been so. The prospect was equally extensive east and west, and as I took a pocket spying-glass with me, we viewed therewith the vast extent we commanded. We discovered Launces- ton Castle with the naked eye; through the glass it be- came very visible. We were much struck with tbe beau- tiful and highly-cultivated lands to the east of us, ter- minated in part by the high land of Dartmoor. To the westward, nothing was to be seen but a vast continuance of moor land, without a hedge, without a tree, for a stretch of many miles. The cultivated land commenced"], [233, "189 ST. CLEER. just below our feet to the eastward, and the uncultivated from where we stood westward ; the contrast on turning from west to east, or vice versa, was astonishing. Our station seemed to be amidst the wreck of mountains of granite, rocks piled on rocks were strewed around in awful grandeur. Tbe extreme point of our western view, dimmed by distance, showed us that elevated rock called Roach Rock, and we also saw Dosmerry Pool about four or five miles off; our south view commanded Ply mouth Sound, and a long extent of coast and sea; the northward in one part was terminated by the sea. The views brought to my mind the beautiful lines in Ovid: \" Turn freta diflsundi, rapidisque tumescere ventis Jussit, et ambit\u00e6 circumdare littora terr\u00e6. Addidit et fontes, immensaque stagna lacusque. Jussit et extendi campos, subsidere valles, Fronde tegi siivas, lapidosos surgere montes.\" \" Then he ordered the seas to poured abroad, and to swell with furious winds, and to draw a shore quite round the inclosed earth. He likewise added springs, and immense pools and lakes. He ordered likewise plains to be extended, and valleys to sink ; the woods to be covered with green leaves, and the rocky monntains to rise.\" \"From this elevated spot (Sharp Tor) Hingston Hill appeared considerably beneath us. After spending some time on Sharp Tor, we reluctantly descended and went towards another range of rocks, called Killmarth Hill (which signifies the Holy Hill or Land, or perhaps Holy Grove), about three-quarters of a mile off. This range of rocks looks from Sharp Tor, like an immense wall of artificial masonry, with here and there turrets ascending, and it brought to my mind Sir George Staunton's account of the Chinese wall. When we ar rived at its base, we alighted from our horses, and as cended. This natural wall-looking range is composed of granite rocks of, I should suppose some of them, a thousand tons weight. We traversed along the ridge, with some difficulty, towards the first turret, and from"], [234, "190 ST. CLEER. that to the next aud so on, but the highest, which at a distance looked somewhat like Wringcheese, was yet to be explored; at length we arrived at it, and found it, if possible, more curious than Cheese-wring itself. It consists of immense rocks piled one on the other, to the height of twenty or thirty feet, and it leans so much, that a perpendicular dropped from its top would, I may venture to say, reach tbe bottom fifteen or more feet from its base ; and from where we stood on the ridge, its support at the base appeared so slight as if a man could shove the whole mass over the precipice. Some of the uppermost stones of this pile are, I should think, from fifteen to twenty feet over, and the base of the whole fabric appeared so slight, that I imagined the handle of my whip would have exceeded its thickness. Upon descending to take another view of this astonishing structure, we found that the rocks were considerably thicker on one side than the other; so that the thick parts formed a counterpoise to the overhanging parts; but this not being apparent from the spot on which we first stood, was the cause of our great astonishment. However, though our astonishment was somewhat les sened, yet much remained at this stupendous pile. This is the most western turret. \" From this place one of the party and myself, the others not chusing to accompany us, went to explore the easternmost turret. Upon our arrival at its base we found much difficulty in ascending it ; the rocks jutted out, one over the other, in such a manner that, had we slipped but a few inches, we must have dropped over a considerable precipice. I arrived first at the base, and attempted to ascend, but fear pulled me back. Upon my friend's arrival we thought we would exert ourselves to get up, as we conjectured there might be a Druidieal basin at top. My friend got up the first rock by creep ing at full length under the overhanging rock; and I was under the necessity of several times desiring him,"], [235, "191 ST. CLEER. in the most energetic manner, to keep as close in as pos sible; for if the body had gone a few inches further out, it must have slid over the sloping rock which overhung the precipice. It took him a few minutes to drag him self in in this manner. In this creeping state he thought he should have broken his watch to pieces, as he was obliged, as before stated, to crawl at full length, there being no possibility ; on account of the overhanging rock, of going on hands and knees. Upon trying to get out his watch, I earnestly entreated him to desist, for fear of losing his centre of gravity ; for on the left hand was the precipice, and raising his right side ever so little might have been attended with most serious conse quences. He took my advice, and by another exertion got far enough in to raise himself on his hands and knees, and then on his legs. I then followed him in the same manner. We then examined the rocks above us, in order to observe the best mode of ascending them. I first made the ascent, and in the uppermost rock dis covered the largest Druidieal basin we had met with, and observed it had a lip or channel facing the south. The horrid precipices on each side prevented my getting on the top of this rock, as I felt a slight vertigo. I then got down on a lower rock, and my friend ascended the uppermost one, and not finding himself dizzy, got into the basin itself (where I hope he will never go again), and waved his hat to our companions below. I desired him to measure the circumference of this basin, which he did with his whip, and found it to be about three feet and a half in diameter. We did not take its depth, but I think it must have been about a foot ; it was of a circular form. The next thing to be considered was, how we should get down again ; which at last, however, we effected nearly in the same manner (only reversing our movements) as we got up ; and I believe nothing will ever induce me to pay a second visit to the top of this rock."], [236, "192 ST. CLEER. \" We had a very fine day for our excursion ; the sun being clouded, it was not over warm ; and there was but little wind : had there been more wind, we should not have been able to ascend some of the places we did, particularly the last. The air was somewhat hazy over the North and South seas, which was the only thing we had to regret. \"A finer situation for Druidieal* residence, rites, and * Druid, Dhuides, or Druid/e. \u2014 Some derive this word from the Hebrew Derussim, or Drussim ; which they translate Contemplatores. Pliny, Salma- sius, Vignierius, and others, derive the name from Spvs, an oak, on account of their inhabiting, or at least frequenting and teaching in forests, or because they sacrificed under the oak. Menace derives the word from the old British \" Drus,\" which signifies \" D\u00e6mon\" or \" Magician ;\" Borel, from the old British \" Dru\" or \" Deru ;\" whence he takes Sptts to be derived. Goropius Becanus, lib. i. takes \" Druis\" to be an old Celtic or German word, formed from \" trowis\" or \" truis,\" signifying a \" Doctor of the Truth and Faith.\" Father Peyron, in his book of the Original ofthe Celtic Language, will have both Greek and Latin tn come from Celtic ; and if so, the Greek word fyur must come from the Celtic \" deru.\" The groves where they worshipped were called Llwyn ; thence, probably, is de- rived the word \" Llan,\" signifying now, in Welch, a church.

Carnedde,\" or Heaps of Stones, on which they had a peculiar mode of worship; \"3rd. Cromlech,\" or Altars, on which they performed the solemnities of sacrifice. There were several orders of them : \u2014 1st. Druids ; the chief of these was a sort of Pontifex Maximus, or High Priest ; these had the care and direction of matters respecting religion ; 2nd. Bards ; who were an inferior order to the Druids, and whose business it was to celebrate the praises of their heroes, in songs composed and sung to their harps ; 3rd. Eubates ; who applied them selves chiefly to the study of Philosophy, and the contemplation of the wonder ful works of Nature. There were Women as well as Men Druids ; for it was a female Druid who foretold to Dioclesian, when a private soldier, that he would be Emperor of Rome. They taught physics, or natural philosophy; were versed in astro nomy and the computation of time; were skilled in arithmetic and mecha nics j and appear to have been the grand source from whence the ages in which they lived derived all the knowledge which they possessed. Among the numerous places sacred to Druidieal worship many hieroglyphical characters have been discovered, which doubtless were intended for something relative to their opinions ofthe Deity to whom they paid their adoration. But, in addition to this, they taught their pupils a number of verses, which were only"], [237, "193 ST. CLEER. ceremonies, I think, could not be fixed on anywhere ; every thing around is awfully magnificent; probably in ancient days these masses of rocks were surrounded with trees. Our guide indeed informed us that on digging the soil trunks of large trees have been there discovered ; and Kil-mar, Kill-mark, Kil-marth signify, in Cornish, the Great, the Horse, or the Wonderful Grove. Since writing the above, I have been again to see these curiosities (but did not visit the top of the eastern most turret), and went by the way of St. Cleer Church town, near which is a curious old well, with a moor stone cross by it, worth seeing; the stone itself is in form of a cross, and it has a cross in relief cut on its cross. About a mile from St. Cleer Church (on the way to Cheese Wring) stands a most magnificent CROMLECH, on a barrow in a field near the high road, on the tene ment called Trethevye. A friend who was with me took a rough measurement of the upper or covering stone, and calculated it to be about five tons weight. The stones which form this Cromlech are supposed to have a sort of memorials or annals in use amongst them. Some persons remained twenty years under their instruction, which they did not deem it lawful to com mit to writing. They used indeed the Greek alphabet, but not the language, as appears by a note, chap. xiii. lib. VI. of C\u00e6sar's Commentaries de Bell. Gall. This custom, according to Julius C\u00e6sar, seems to have been adopted for two reasons ; first, not to expose their doctrines to the common people ; and, se condly, lest their scholars, trusting to letters, should be less anxious to remem ber their precepts, because such assistance commonly diminishes application and weakens the memory. The original manner of writing amongst the ancient Britons was by cutting the letters with a knife upon sticks, which were commonly squared, and some times formed with three sides. Their religious ceremonies were but few, and similar to those of the ancient Hebrews. The unity of the Supreme Being was the foundation of their religion ; and Origen, in his Commentaries of Ezekiel, inquiring into the reasons of the rapid progress of Christianity in Britain, says, \" this island has long been predisposed to it by the doctrine of the Druids, which had ever taught the unity of God the Creator.\" (Extracted from the Monthly Magazine and Literary Panorama for November 1819.) o"], [238, "194 ST. CLEER. been brought some miles from where they stand, as there are none of the same kind near it. That this is a work of art there cannot be a doubt. One can hardly, however, suppose it possible that such immense stones could have been brought from a distance, and erected in the manner they are. What machinery was used baffles all conjecture. The upper or covering stone has a hole in it ; for what purpose I have no idea, unless to support a flag-pole. One of the party remarked it might have been made for a chain to drag it by; but I rather thought it too near the edge for that purpose. Mr. Britton, in his \"Beauties of England and Wales,\" has given a vignette of this Cromlech, which is well executed, and like the original. Speaking of this Crom- lech, Mr. B. says, he believes it has not been described by any writer,* though it is more curious and of greater mag- nitude than that of M ona, or any other he was acquainted with. He says \"it standeth about one mile and a half east of St. Cleer, on an eminence commanding an ex- tensive tract of country, particularly to the east, south, and south-west ; and is provincially denominated Tre vethey Stone. On the north the high ground of the Moors exalts its swelling outline above it. It is all of granite, and consists of six upright stones, and one large slab covering them in an inclined position. This impost measures sixteen feet in length and ten broad, and is at a medium about fourteen inches thick. It rests on five of the uprights only ; and at its other end is perforated by a small circular hole. No tradition exists as to the * This author is mistaken.

Those ladies, although an exaggeration from eleven to eleven thousand is suspected by some writers, were to have married a Roman emperor and his principal offi cers ; but being attacked on their landing by Pagan Saxons, they defended themselves with a courage wor thy of Cornwall, until all were slain with arms in their hands. Yet one hardly sees why these heroic females were honoured among the saints. Their deaths as mar tyrs are referred to the 20th of October 383, and their tomb is still shown at Cologne, where a monastery has been built to their memory. THE EDITOR. Not far from King Doniert's stone monument is ano ther perpendicular moor-stone, on which is still apparent the figure of a cross; and on another, not far distant, is a cross shaped like a T. Without doubt I think this our King Doniert lived and died in his town and castle of Leskeard, where it was not lawful to bury the bodies of dead men till the year 700. It is moreover to be noted, with regard to the inscription on his monument of stone, that about this time it was customary to pray for departed souls. o 2"], [240, "196 ST. CLEER.

The only variety which this rock presents are coarse and fine grained masses, and a kind of fluor, near Carraton Hill, containing hornblende. Immediately south of the granite, on the side of a barren moor, masses of compact and quartz ore felspar rock protrude, indi cating the same formation as at Trewist in Alternun. Near the church hornblende slate prevails, which is said to contain veins of actynolite and asbestos. A little further south, on the ridge of a barren down, massive hornblende rock projects in tiers ; and loose blocks of the same stone lie scattered over the side of the hill, and in the adjacent valley.

Quere, whether St. Clede, or Clete, mentioned in that Inquisition aforesaid, relate not to St. Clete, or Cletus, Bishop of Rome and martyr, as the tutelar guardian and patron of this church? whose history in short is thus: He was born at Rome, of an old family of gentlemen or noblemen, in the reign of Tiberius ; whose father's name was Emelianus, a Chris tian, that placed his son Clete a disciple under St. Pe ter ; after which he made him and Linnus coadjutors in the ministry. To Linnus St. Peter gave the charge of affairs within Rome, to Cletus the charge of the churches abroad ; and those two holy men had both the succession of the Bishopric of Rome, after St. Peter's"], [242, "198 ST. CLEATHER. death, (dement through humility declining that office, who in justice should have had it,) till the time that Domitian, the son of Vespasian, enjoyed the empire, who, degenerating from the morality of his father and brother Titus, raised the second persecution against the Christians; at which time, amongst many others, St. Cletus Bishop of Rome received tbe crown of martyr dom, after he had held the Bishopric twelve years and seven months and two days, 26th April, anno Dom. 91, tempore Domitian. He lies buried by the body of St. Peter at Rome, and is one of the saints mentioned in the Canon of the Mass, as also in St. Paul's Epistle to Timothy. He is said, by order of St. Peter, to have divided the City of Rome into twenty-five districts or parishes, and to have set up a priest to rule and govern in spiritual matters over such Christians as were within the same, and attended their predicaments ; whose suc cessors afterwards in those churches were called car dinals. See Peransand for the family of Cleathers Bas-ill, in this parish, or Bas-yll, in former ages (at best being but a poor corn country) has been for many ages the seat ofthe worshipful family ofthe Trevillians [Trevelyan] ; the present possessor, Peter Trevillian, Esq. that married Borlace, his father Arundell. His ancestor was John Trevillian, Esq. of Nettlecomb in Somerset, who was sheriff of Somerset and Dorset 17 Henry VII.; his grandson John Trevillian, Esq. was sheriff of Cornwall 38 Henry VIII. The arms of which gentlemen are in a field Gules, a demy horse Argent, issuing out of the waves of the sea Azure, grounded upon a tradition that one of their ancestors, at the supposed general inundation or concussion into the sea, of a tract of land called Lyon-ness, extend ing from St. Sennan to the Scilly Islands, saved himself by sitting on the back of a white horse, whilst he swam from thence through the sea to the insular continent of"], [243, "199 ST. CLEATHER. Cornwall, where he came safe to land; but when I con sider that Solinus, who lived 1500 years past, tells us that the Cassiterides, by which he means the Scilly Islands (or the tin islands), in his days were separated from the coast of the Danmonii, by a rough sea ot two or three hours' sail (as it still appears to be), and that hereditary coat armours and surnames in Britain are little above five hundred years old in Britain or Corn wall, there is small credit to be given to this tradition. In this parish, or part of Davidstowe, is Foye-fenton, the original fountain ofthe Foys River ; which well, in old records, is also called West Fenton, i. e. the west well, to distinguish it from Mark well in Lanick, otherwise east well; from which places the two cantreds (hundreds) of Eastwellshire and Westwellshire are denominated. And to this purpose it is evident, from Carew's Survey of Cornwall, page 41, that in 3 Henry IV. Reginald de Ferrar held in East Fenton and West Fenton, several knights' fees of land of the honour of Tremeton, which is now East and West Hundreds. (See also St. Ste phen's by Saltash, of those tenures in 1360.) TONKIN. In this parish stands Basil, a word sometimes taken for a herb or vegetable, sometimes for a vein in the human body, sometimes for the basilisk or cockatrice, &c; but here I take it to signify after the Greek, a basilica or stately building; and although at present this mansion will not answer the etymology in the extreme latitude or longitude thereof, yet in probability it for merly did, at least comparatively so in respect to other houses in the neighbourhood. This place is the mansion of the ancient, famous, and knightly family of Trevillyans; the present possessor of Basil is Peter Trevillyan, who married a daughter of Mr. Nicholas Borlase of Treludderin. From this Cor-"], [244, "200 ST. CLEATHER. nish family are descended the Trevillyans of Nettlecomb in Somersetshire. Although this parish is commonly called and written St. Cleather, yet the right name is St. Eledred, and so it is written in the Taxatio Beneficiorum ; which St. Eledred I take to be Ethelred King of the Mercians, who, after he had held the crown for thirty years, and governed with great reputation, and especially with much regard to religion, which (as William of Malmes bury observes) was more to this prince's inclination than arms, resigned the kingdom to his kinsman Kendred, became a monk, and died soon after in the monastery of Bordeney in Lincolnshire. There was, however, another St. Ethelred, King of the West Saxons, who is said by Mr. Browne Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, to be buried at Wimborne Minster in Dorsetshire, with tbe following inscription : In hoc loco quiescit corpus Sancti Ethelredi Regis West-Saxorura martyris, qui A.D. 872, 23 die April's, per manus Danorum Paganorum occubuit. Perhaps this latter is the true patron. THE EDITOR. Bishop Tanner, in the Notitia Monastica, says of Bordeney Abbey, \" Here was a public monastery before the year 697, to which Ethelred King of Mercia was a great bene factor, if not the original founder; who upon the resig nation of his crown retired hither, and became first a monk, and afterwards abbat of this house till his death. It is said to have had three hundred monks, but was de stroyed by the Danes A.D. 870.\" The branch or stock of the Trevelyans settled at Basil is now extinct. A Sir John Trevelyan, Knight, of that place, is said to have greatly reduced his for tunes by various law-suits. An anecdote is anciently related of him in the neighbourhood, that having failed"], [245, "201 ST. CLEATHER. in making an appearance to some civil suit, a process issued to the sheriff for attaching his person, who went to Basil accompanied by several horsemen, and riding into the court-yard made proclamation of his authority, and called on the defendant to surrender ; but he, on the contrary, threatened the sheriff if he did not depart, with letting loose his spearmen upon him, and then over turned some hives of bees, which effectually routed the whole troop.

St. Clement's is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north St. Herme and St. Allen ; on the west Kenwyn ; east the creek of Trevilian River; south and west Truro River, or arm of the sea. In Domesday Roll, 20 Win. I. A.D. 1087, it was taxed under the Great Earl of Cornwall's manor (now Duchy) of Mor-is or Mor-es, id est, the manor or parish of the sea, or a manor situated on the sea, according to the natural circumstances of the place. And I doubt not that before the Norman Conquest this church or chapel was extant; since, at the time ofthe Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester (1294), it was va lued to the first fruits vi/., vicar ejusdem xiiis. iuid., by no other name than Ecclesia de Mores, which was en dowed or founded undoubtedly by the Lords of the Manor of Mores, that is the Earl of Cornwall, whose successors, the Dukes, still possess the lands, and are patrons of the church. In Wolsey's Inquisition 1525, and Valor Beneficioruin, this church is called Clemens, and valued to first fruits \u00a3\u00a7. In this church town is the well-known place of Conor, Condura, id est, the King or Prince's Water (viz. Corn wall), whose royalty is still over the same, and whose lands cover comparatively the whole parish ; from which place in all probability was denominated Cundor or Condor, in Latin Condorus, i. e. Condura, Earl of Corn wall at the time of the Norman Conquest, who perhaps lived, or was born here. And moreover, the inhabitants of this church town and its neighbourhood will tell you, by tradition from age to age, that here once dwelt a great lord and lady called Condura. This Condurus, as our historians tell us, in \\0&6 sub-"], [247, "st.

Is it not, therefore, more probable that this Earl Condurus confederated with his countrymen at Exeter, in that insurrection of the people against the Conqueror in the 3rd year of his reign, and for that reason was deprived of his earldom ? Be it as it was, certain it is he married and had issue Cad-dock (id est, bear or carry-war), his son and heir, whom some authors call Condor the Second, who is by them taken for and celebrated as Earl of Cornwall. But what part of the lands or estate thereof he en joyed (whilst Robert and William, Earls of Morton afore said, his contemporaries, for thirty years were alive, and doubtless possessed thereof, as well as his title and dig nity) hath not yet appeared to me. His chief dwelling and place of residence was at Jutsworth, near Saltash and Trematon, where he married and had issue one only daughter named Agnes, as some say, others Beatrix, who was married to Reginald Fitz- Harry, base son of King Henry I., by his concubine Anne Corbett, in whose right he was made Earl of Cornwall, after William Earl of Cornwall aforesaid had forfeited the same, by attain der of treason against the Conqueror and his sons, and was deprived thereof. This Earl Caddock, or Condor the 2nd, departed this life 1120, and lies buried in the chancel of St. Stephen's Church, by Saltash, and gave for his arms, in a field Sable, 15 bezants palewise, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1.

Lastly, let the reader observe, that if the true name of this church be St. Clement's, then its tutelar guardian and patron, to whom it was dedicated, was St. Clement, Pope and martyr of Rome; whose name is derived from Clemens, mild, meek, merciful, gracious. He was born in the region of Calimontana in Italy; his father's name Faustine. He was contemporary with St. Paul, and was his coadjutor or assistant in preaching the Gospel, as is testified by himself in his epistle to Timothy, wherein he saith, \" Help those persons that labour with me in the Gospel, whose names are written in the Book of Life.\" He appointed that in the seven regions of Rome should be the notaries, to write the deeds and martyrdoms of the Christians, and commanded that such as were baptized and had learnt the principles of the Christian religion, should receive the sacrament of confirmation, and as some write, he made the Canon of the Apostles and the Apostolic Constitutions now extant. Finally, for preach- ing the Gospel of Christ in derogation of the Roman religion, he was by command of the Emperor Trajan, with a rope about his neck, and an anchor fastened thereto, cast into the main sea and drowned, uttering those last words, \" Eternal Father, receive my soul ! \" after he had been Pope of Rome nine years, two months, and ten days, the 23rd of November Anno Dom. 102.

The Polwhelcs of this place are of great antiquity. They flourished before the Conquest, at which time they were so eminent that Drew de Polwhele was chamberlain to the Conqueror's queen; and the late John Polwhele, Esq. had not long since in his possession, a grant from her to the said Drew of several lands in this county, which deed he having sent to a gentleman to peruse, he could never get it back again. From the time of this Drew or Drogo de Polwhele, the family have lived with much esteem in this their habitation, till the latter part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, when Degory Polwhele, on his marriage with Catherine the eldest daughter and co heir of Robert Trencreek, Esq. removed to her seat of Treworgan in St. Erme, where the family resided till the sale of that place to Mr. Collins, when they returned to their old dwelling. The present possessor, Richard Polwhele, Esq. was sheriff of Cornwall 9 George I. 1723. The family suffered greatly in the civil wars. Penhellick was once a considerable seat, although now it is divided into several premises, in one of wbich lately resided Mr. Robert Polwhele, younger brother to John Polwhele, Esq. and in another Captain Thomas Gregor, of Truro. Trewhythenick formerly belonged to a family of the same name, who gave for their arms, Argent, a chevron within a border engrailed Sable. This manor came afterwards to the diamonds. Park also belonged to a family of the same name. Lambesso belonged to the Tredenhams, but for some time past to the Footes. THE EDITOR Polwhele has descended from the gentleman who"], [252, "208 ST. CLEATHER. served the office of sheriff in 1723, to his grandson, the Rev. Richard Polwhele, author of a history of Corn wall, and so distinguished by his works in every de partment of literature ; by his early poetical effusions, when \" He lispM in numbers for the numbers came ;' by those of his maturer age; by sermons equally sound in learning and in diction, and persuasive by their elo quence ; that no Cornishman of the present day can presume to place himself, I will not say in competition, but in the same class of literary excellence with Mr. Polwhele. At Penhellick, about seventy years ago, the Rev. John Collins, rector of Redruth, built a house for his own residence after removing -te-the village; he is re ported to have selected this spot in consequence of several persons residing in it having attained great ages. On his decease, the house and lands were sold to a Colonel Macarmicke, originally a wine merchant at Truro, who much enlarged the house, and endeavoured to affix some fanciful new name on the place. The property has since passed through various hands, and the house has generally been unoccupied. This parish contains 3156 statute acres.

As for the south aile of this church before-mentioned, it was called Jesus Chapel, and therein was founded Tri nity chantry ; towards building or endowment whereof the Lords of Resurrans tied these lands for ever to pay to the same 13s. Ad. per annum, with power of distress. At the dissolution of this chantry 1 Edward VI. John Chaplin was chief chanter, or sole priest thereof, and seised of the said rent, as his predecessors had been long before ; and King Edward being so possessed, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, sold the same, with other things, to Sir Hugh Pomeroy, Knight, and Thos. Pomeroy, Esq. his brother; who the 4th Edward VI. sold it to"], [259, "ST. COLOMB MAJOR. 215 William Saplyn; and Saplyn, in the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, sold it to John Glyn, Esq., John Ga nergan, William Prye, John Manifield, Richard Carter, Henry Rouse, John Vivian, and Richard Hancanon, who were trustees for the parish of Sancta Colomba. After which conveyances the Lord of Resurrans refused to pay the said rent. Whereupon the parish distrained those lands, and the owner thereof replevined the goods so taken, which occasioned the parish bringing an action in replevin against the replevers thereof; and for plea, by way of avowry, did allege that' those goods they ought to take, for that one John chaplain of Trinity chantry was seised of the said rent in fee, as his pre decessors time out of mind had been before, in right of the said chantry, from which it passed to King Edward the Sixth, and the purchasers under him as aforesaid. Whereupon the issue passed for the plaintiff, or parish, against the Lord of Resurrans. (See St. Michael Pen kivell, St. Mary Wike ; also for Chantry, see St. Cuth bert for prayer for the dead.) In the year 1676, the greatest part of this church of St. Colomb was casually blown up with gunpowder by three youths of the town, scholars therein, who, in the absence of their master and the rest of their companions, ignorantly set fire to a barrel of gunpowder, the parish stores, laid up in the stone stairs and walls ofthe rood loft, which occasioned thedestruction of it and themselves together; for the glass-window, roofs, timber, stones, and pillars, thereby made a direful concussion together, especially those shot from the walls of the moorsione stairs aforesaid, to the total defacing the church and many pews thereof. In this tragical concussion several accidents were strange and unaccountable. As, first, that one Nicho las Jane, a hellyar, was on a ladder mending the heal ing, or stones on the roof ofthe church, when it hap pened, whereby he himself and the ladder under him"], [260, "216 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. were blown up also; but both fell to the ground without hurt. Secondly, the church bible and common-prayer book, with their leaves open, in the rector's pew, scarce two feet from the rood-loft stairs, where the powder took fire and broke out, were neither singed, moved, nor so much as any dust about them, though many thou sand stones were cast about the church. Thirdly, there was at least a tou weight of lime and stone cast upon the communion table, which was old and slight, having but one foot or pedestal to stand upon, and yet the same was not broken nor hurt. Fourthly, the pulpit was in like manner preserved from the fury and rage of the sire and stones, when the very walls and pillars near it were shattered to pieces. Let divines and philosophers give a reason for these things, if there was not a supernatural cause or Providence for it ! By this sad accident this church of St. Colomb re ceived damage to the value of about 350/.; yet was, by the liberal contributions of its inhabitants, in nine months time built and repaired as it now stands, and what was wanting in subscriptions to make up that sum, was raised by a small parish rate on the lands thereof. The chief subscribers, Sir John Saint Aubyn, of Tre kininge, Baronet, 20/. ; his grandmother-in-law, the widow of Peter Jenkin, Esq. 20/.; John Vivian, Esq. of Truan, 20/.; his three sons, Thomas, John, and Francis Vivian, 15/.; Robert Hoblyn, Esq. 10/.; Edward, his son, 5/. ; Captain Ralph Keate, 5/. ; the writer of this volume 51.; John Day, Gent. 5/.; Peter Day, Gent. 5/.; Honour Carter, widow, 10/.; John Bligh, Gent. 5/.; Peter Pollard, senior, 10/.; John Beauford, rector, 20/., with several others. And, as if the fiery element had a particular power over this church, it is further memorable that several times before a stone pinnacle of the tower thereof was cast down with thunder and lightning, and had as often been built up again to no purpose, till at length the"], [261, "217 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. workmen were advised, upon their last operation, to in scribe in the stone thereof, \" God bless and preserve this work;\" since which time it hath stood invincible for about sixty years. But, alas ! notwithstanding this pinnacle hath been thus exempted from the raging of the fiery element, yet its next neighbour, the lofty spire or steeple on the said tower, a strong and well-built struc ture, bound or cramped together with iron and cast lead through the moor-stones thereof, (so that, compara tively, according to man's judgment, it might last till the final consummation of all things,) yet so it happened on a Thursday in July 1690, that about one of the clock in the afternoon, when the people were at their traffic in the market place contiguous with the church yard, the said spire or steeple was torn and shattered to pieces with a flash of lightning, and totally thrown to the ground, and the iron bars therein wreathed and wrested asunder as threads, to the great terror and as tonishment of the beholders. It was further observable when this concussion happened, only divers flashes of lightning appeared, but no sound or crack of thunder was heard ; from whence I infer that when the voice of thunder is heard, the fiery matter in the middle region, perhaps not three miles above our heads, hath spent its force and strength. This spire also was soon after re edified by the inhabitants of this parish, though much short of its former height and bigness, as it now stands. Again, contiguous with this church-yard was formerly extant a college of Black Monks or Canons Augustine, consisting of three fellows, for instructing youth in the liberal arts and sciences; which college, when or by whom erected and endowed I know not. However, I take it to be one of those three colleges in this province named in Speed and Dugdale's Monasticon, whose re venues they do not express, (nor the places where they were extant,) but tell us that they were dedicated to the"], [262, "218 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. blessed Virgin Mary, the lady of angels, and were black monks ofthe Augustines. In this college, temp. Henry VL, was bred up John Arundell, a younger son of Renfry Arundell, of Lan herne, Esq. sheriff of Cornwall 3 Edward IV. where he had the first taste of the liberal arts and sciences, and was afterwards placed at Exon College in Oxford, where he stayed till he took his degree of Master of Arts, and then was presented by his father to John Booth, Bishop of Exeter, to be consecrated priest, and to have collation, institution, and induct, into his rectory of St. Colomb. Which being accordingly performed, and he resided upon this rectory glebe lands for some time, which gave him opportunity to build the old parsonage house still extant thereon, and moat the same round with rivers and fish-ponds, as Sir John Arundell, Knight, informed me afterwards. In the year 1496, he had by Henry VII. bestowed upon -him the bishopric of Lichfield and Coventry, then void upon the translation of William Smith to Lincoln, (the successor of John Hals,) in which see he remained till the year 1501, and then, upon the death or translation of Richard Redman, Bishop of Exeter, he was removed to that diocese by Henry VII. then possessed of great revenues, but died at London, 1504, and was buried at St. Clement's Danes Church. Before this church of St. Colomb was erected, within the borders of its now parish were extant four free cha pels, wherein God was worshipped in former ages, viz. at Tregoos (i. e. the wood towne), Tre-sithan-y (the weekly town, the town frequented on the Sabbath) ; Ruth-es (i. e. the multitude is); and Lan-hengye (i. e. the church or temple of sentence, judgment, or delibe rating cases). The old cemeteries of which are now all converted to orchards and gardens, or arable ground. The town of St. Colomb, by the mediation of its lords, the Arundells of Lanherne,' is privileged with a weekly market on Thursdays, wherein all things necessary for"], [263, "219 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. the life of man are vended at a moderate rate ; as also with fairs on Thursday after Midlent Sunday, and on Thursday after Allhallows. This place was heretofore for a long time notorious for the vice of excessive topling or toping, not only to the damage of many of the inhabitants' healths and wealth, but also to the loss of too many lives; 1 mean in the time of Charles II. when the practice of quaffing, toasting, or healthing, debauch and immorality, over spread the land in general. In this parish stands Castell-an-Dinas. It consists of about six acres of ground, within three circles or in trenchments, upon the top of a pyramidal hill, composed or built of turf and unwrought stones, after the British manner, without lime or mortar, comparatively a hedge; each of those circles or ramparts rising about eight foot above each other towards the centre of the castle, con sisting of about an acre and a half of land, in the midst whereof appear the ruins of some old dilapidated houses; near which is a flat vallum, pit, or tank, wherein rain or cloud-water, that falls down from the middle regions, abides more or less in quantity as it falls one half of the year ; which, I suppose, heretofore supplied the sol diers' occasions, as no fountain, spring, or river water is within a thousand paces thereof. There were two gates or portals leading to this fort, the one on the east, the other on the west side thereof, which, on a stony causeway now covered with grass, conducts you up and down the hill towards Tre-kyning, that is to say the king's, prince, or ruler's town. Moreover, contiguous with this castle are tenements of land or fields, named Tre-saddarne, that is to say god Saturn's town, a place where the god Saturn was worshipped by the soldiers, who probably had their temple or chapel here before Christianity. Near this castle, by the highway, stands the Coyt, a stony tumulus so called, of which sort there are many"], [264, "220 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. in Wales and Wiltshire, as is mentioned in the Additions to Camden's Britannia in those places, commonly called the Devil's Coyts. It consists of four long stones of great bigness, perpendicularly pitched in the earth contiguous with each other, leaving only a small vacancy down- wards, but meeting together at the top ; over all which is laid a flat stone of prodigious bulk and magnitude, bending towards the east in way of adoration, (as Mr. Lhuyd concludes of all those Coyts elsewhere,) as the person therein under it interred did, when in the land of the living; but how, or by what art this prodigious flat stone should be placed on the top of the others, amazeth the wisest mathematicians, engineers, or archi tects, to tell or conjecture. Colt, in Belgic-British, is a cave, vault, or cott-house, of which coyt might possibly be a corruption. Not far from this coyt, at the edge of the Goss-moor, there is a large stone, wherein is deeply imprinted a mark, as if it were the impress of four horseshoes, and to this day called King Arthur's Stone ; yea, tradition tells us they were made by King Arthur's horse's feet, when he resided at Castle Denis, and hunted in the Goss Moor. But this stone is now overturned by some seekers for money. On another part of this parish, near Retallock Bar row (that is to say, Retallock Grave), is a notable tumu lus, wherein some human creature of that place was interred before the 16th century. Retalloch signifies exceeding or too much buckler or target, not far from which is still extant, in the open downs, nine perpendi cular stones, called the Nine Maids, in Cornish Naw-voz, alias the nine sisters, in Cornish Naw-whoors, which very name informs us that they were sepulchral stones, erect ed in memory either of nine natural or spiritual sisters of some religious house, and not so many maids turned into stones for dancing on the Sabbath Day, as the country people will tell you. Those stones are set. in"], [265, "221 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. order by a line, as is such another monument also called the Nine Maids in Gwendron, by the highway, about twety-five feet distance from each other; or it is rather in Stithian's parish. Truan, Truin, Truyn,Trevan, Trewyn, are all synony mous words, signifying a nose, nook, or beak of any matter or thing; here to be construed as a nose, nook, or beak of land, extant or notable amongst others ; which place and Trenouth, for four descents, hath been the dwelling of the gentle family of the Vivians, who have flourished here in worshipful degree. The present possessor of this place is my very kind friend John Vivian, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall about 20 Charles II. and one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, a gentleman famous for his hospitality and cha rity. He married three wives ; the first, Jane, daughter of Sir John Trelawny, Bart., but had no issue by her that lived; his second was Mary, daughter of John Glanvill, of Killyvor, Esq., in Devon, by whom he had issue Thomas, John, Francis, Anne, and Jane ; his last wife was Specott, the relict of Nicholls, by whom he had no issue. His father married two wives, Bullet and Cavall; his grandfather married Lure; his great-grandfather one of Tresaster's heirs, as I am in formed. Thomas Vivian, Esq., eldest son of the aforesaid John, married Blathwayte, sister to William Blathwayte, Esq. Secretary at War to King James the Second and William the Third, but had no issue by her. His second wife was the daughter of Dodson, Esq. but died with out issue by her. His second brother, John Vivian, Esq. barrister-at-law, married also two wives : the first Anne, daughter of Matthew Hals, of Efford, Esq., but she also died without issue ; on whose death her father-in-law made this epitaph fixed on her hearse, 1682: Who underneath this mournful sable lies, But one that did all worldly pomp despise ?"], [266, "222 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. It 's not adorned with painted pageantry, To blazon forth her great antiquity; Nor were 't more necessary to be done, Than lighting candles in the mid-day sun ; Her shining virtues did so far exceed, That of this lesser lustre there 's no need. These'praise her in the gates ; these speak on earth, Her higher extract and her heavenly birth. And now she 's parted hence, but to go home ; For where Bhe born was, thither must she come.

His second wife was Mary, daughter of Joseph Sawle, of Penrice, Esq. by whom he hath issue John, Mary, and Thomas. Francis Vivian, Esq. third son ofthe aforesaid John, married Anne, daughter of Henry Mynon, gent., sole heir to Iier mother Bridget, the only surviving child of Sir Samuel Coswarth, Knight (see Colan), by whom he had issue one only daughter named Mary, now wife of Sir Richard Vivian, Baronet. Ann Vivian married Si mon Leach, gent, some time her father's clerk; Jane married James Beaufort, clerk. The arms of those Vivians are the same as was borne and given by Prior Thomas Vivian, of Bodmin, with some small difference. (See Bodmin.) In the town of St. Colomb, for three or four descents, lived the gentle family of the Carters (originally de scended from the Carters of Staffordshire), whereby trade and merchandise they got a great estate, and married with Vivian, Arundell of golverne, and Moyle of Bake ; and lastly, Richard Carter, Esq., a Justice of the Peace, and Member of Parliament for Mitchell, married Eliza beth King, alias Lucas, alias Shepard, of the City of Lon don, spinster, a woman destitute of fame and fortune, whereby he was led into such excess of riot and expence of monies that he was forced to sell all his lands, and"], [267, "223 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. reduced himself to about 50/. per annum during life. Part of his lands were sold to his younger brother, John Carter, who married Lawry, whose three daughters and heirs were married to William Silly, Esq., Giles Risdon, of Badleigh, Esq., and Thomas Hoblyn, gent. attorney-at-law, now in possession thereof. The arms of Carter were, In a field Argent, two lions combatant Sable, armed and langued Gules. Trevethick,in this parish, alias Trevidick, i. e. the rus tic or farmer's town, for several descents had been the dwelling of the gentle family of the Arundells, a younger branch of Lanherne stock, particularly Thomas Arun dell, who married the daughter of Sir Giles Montpesson, Knight, by whom he had issue Thomas Arundell, Esq. that died without issue, but not without wasting a great part of his estate. Trekyning aforesaid was for two descents the seat of the Jenkyns, descended from James Jenkyn, gent., attor ney-at-law, temp. James I. who (from a mean origin, his father being a miller), by the inferior practice of the law, got a very great estate, and married Carter, the re lict of Brabyn, and had issue Peter Jenkyn, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall temp. Charles I. Nans-widdon, Nanc-widd-an, i. e. the valley of trees, or the tree valley, in this parish, for four descents has been the dwelling of the gentle family of the Hoblyns, of Leskeard or Treburge, in St. Pinoch, as I am inform ed. The present possessor, Robert Hoblyn, Esq., mar ried Carew of Penwarne ; his father Apeley ; his grandfather ; and givethfor his arms, Argent, a fess Gules, between two stanches Ermine. By Carew Mr. Hoblyn had issue, viz. Edward Hoblyn, Esq. his son and heir, who married Avant's heir, and left issue only a daughter, married to Bickford, Esq.; Richard Hob lyn, bred a merchant factor at Smyrna, that married \u2014 \u2014 Striblehill, but died without issue; Robert Hoblyn, clerk, rector of Ludgvan, and a commissioner of the pence"], [268, "224 ST.

From this house are descended the Hoblyns of St. Enedor, Bodmin, Egles hayle, Helland, and Gurran. Bode-worgye, now Bos-worgy (on part of the lands whereof are yet extant the ruins and downfalls of an old chapel or cemetery extant before the Norman Conquest), formerly the voke lands of a man taxed in Domesday Roll, 20 William I. 1087, for four or five descents was the seat of the genteel family of Keates, and was till lately in the possession of my very kind friend Capt.

Sheriff of Hertfordshire 5 Charles L, ayounger branch of the Baron Hoo of that place, whose heir was married to the Earl of Hunting don temp. Henry VIIL, and in testimony thereof gave the same arms as those barons, viz. Quarterly, Argent and Sable. Those Keates within the memory of man, as they branched downwards, married with Bear, Hals, Avery, and others, and gave for their arms, Argent, three cats Sable. Keate, Ceate, in British, is fallacy, cheat, or delusion. Gauer-y-gan, in this parish, id est, the goat's downs, gave name and original to the genteel family of the Gauerigans, who for several generations lived here in good reputation, till the middle of Queen Elizabeth's"], [269, "ST.

Which family gave for their arms, in allusion to their names, ' in a field Vert, a goat passant Argent, as I am informed ; the form of which is still extant in their pew or seat, the foremost in one of the middle rows of seats in this church. At Tre-sugg-an (id est, the town on the Saggor Bog), in this parish, is the dwelling of Peter Day, gentleman, that married Brabyn. He left issue only two daugh ters, that became his heirs, married to Richard Williams, of Trewithan, Esq., and John Williams, of Carmanton, Esq. Trekyninge Vean, i. e. Trekininge the Less or Lesser, is the dwelling of Joseph Hankey, gent., attorney-at-law, who, by his care and skill in that profession, hath got himself considerable wealth and reputation in those parts. He married two wives, Matthews of Tresangar, and Buroughs of Ward Bridge ; but hath issue by nei ther. His father married Hoblyn of St. Stephen's. Upon Bodeworgy lands aforesaid, or contiguous with it as aforesaid, are still extant the ruins of an old chapel, wherein God heretofore was worshipped, before St. Co lomb church was erected, called Bes-palf-an. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has here copied Hals with very little alter ation, except by way of abridgment. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has a very long dissertation on the claims of another person, a male St. Colomb, to be accounted patron saint of this parish. It is well known that Cornwall received the Christian Q"], [270, "226 sT. COLOMB MAJOR. faith from various individuals who came from Munster, in Ireland, where the learning and the religion of these times certainly flourished : all those persons were held in veneration by their converts, and were distinguished by them as saints. These missionaries were, moreover, so numerous in all parts that Ireland was called the Land of Saints. St. Colomb may possibly be one of those missionaries; but the subject is of little importance, and I am unwilling to bestow the elegant appellation of the Holy Dove, on any other than a female saint. Nanswhyden, unquestionably the White Vale, is mentioned by Mr. Hals as belonging to the Hoblyns. Mr. Robert Hoblyn, of Nanswhyden, who died in 1756, was a very distinguished person. He was generally a man of letters ; but, what is rarely to be found in a coun try gentleman, he excelled in the recondite learning of the East. He built a magnificent house at Manswhyden, and established there a library so extensive, and so rich in manuscripts, as to be valued at thirty thousand pounds. This gentleman received a great addition to his for tune from a most productive copper mine, called Her land, or the Mane Mine, in the parish of Gwineat , and he married a daughter of Mr. Coster, an Alderman of Bristol, at that period the most extensive smelter of cop per ores. In consequence of this connection, and his deserved reputation, Mr. Hoblyn was chosen one of the representatives of Bristol. The house wa entirely consumed by an accidental fire in 1803. The property has descended to his collate ral relation, the Reverend Robert Hoblyn, who inherits also a large portion of his classic taste. This parish measures 12,045 statute acres.

A small portion of the southern part of this parish, adjoining to St. Dennis, rests on granite, the surface of which abounds in projecting masses of short rock. Leav ing this granite district about the Indian Queens, on the great Trnro road, a tin mine, called the Fat Work, pre sents itself, and displays some interesting phenomena- The basis of the rock is a compact felspar, sometimes almost colourless, at other times dark blue and glossy ; but more commonly both these kinds are blended together in stripes or spots like agates. This rock next the lode is much de composed, the blue parts being changed into a light pink ; which shows that the colouring mineral is not hornblend. It is probably shorl, a substance abounding in the quartz veins by which the rock is traversed. The lode of this mine is very curious. It consists of a large massive rock, fifteen fathoms in width, throughout which shorl, and irregular veins of tin ore, are dispersed. The matrix con sists of a dark-coloured basis, interspersed by innumerable angular and fragment-like portions of rock. Near the Indian Queens a manganese mine was for merly worked, and the adjacent moors abound in stream works. A fine blue fissile slate occurs around the town of St. Colomb, and continues for some distance northwards. Near Trewan it is found to contain beds of compact rocks (not unlihe those of the Mount Bay), which in close veins of actynolite. Still proceeding northward, quartz so much prevails, as to occasion sterility in the vol. i. 2 2"], [272, "228 -230 ST. COLOMB MAJOR. land, displayed in open dewns like those of Roach, to which they adjoin. Castle-An-Dinas is composed of a siliceous variety of the rock found at Fat Work mine; and it appears to be one of the sources from whence must have been derived the pebbles and striped shorl rock scattered over Tregoss Moor. St. COLUMB MINOR HALS, Is situate in the hundred of Pedyr, and hath upon the north the Irish sea and St. Mawgan; east, Little Colan ; west, Crantock ; south, Newland. For the name see St. Columb Major. This church's revenues being wholly impropriated, or appropriated to the prior of Bodmin before the Inquisitions of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, 1294, or Wolsey's afterwards, is not named therein ; the prior by ancient composition paying the vicar or curate here only six pounds per annum ; by which bargain he was a great gainer, at least 250/. per annum, and I take it the present patron and impropriator, Mr. Buller, paya the curate not above 25/. per annum. This parish was rated to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1696, 207/. 9s. This church, according to its bigness, is the finest, best-kept, pewed, or seated, that I know of in Cornwall ; the rood-loft, (yet standing, though without a rood on it,) a most curious and costly piece of workmanship, carved and painted with gold, silver, vermillion and bice, is the masterpiece of art in those parts of that kind. The pews or seats are uniform, all msde of black oak ; and to prove their antiquity, there is yet extant an inscription on one of them, containing these words;"], [273, "231 ST. COLOMB MINOR. \" These seats were built by the poor's stock in the year 1525.\" At Tre-loye in this parish (the flowing or abounding town) is still extant a famous chapel, dedicated to St. Pedyr, perhaps of public use before this church of St. Colomb was erected. This district in Domesday Roll passed under the name and jurisdiction of the great lordship and manor of Ry alton, heretofore pertaining to the prior of Bodmin, which lands are held of the Bishop of Exeter's manor of Penryn, and pay yearly 10/. high rent to the same; from whence I gather that formerly both pertained to the bishopric of Cornwall, afterwards converted into Kirton and Exeter; and that afterwards, by compact be tween the said bishop and prior of Bodmin, it was dis membered from that bishopric, and restored to that priory, as parcel of the ancient bishop of Bodmin's re venues, of which that priory consisted, and was en dowed with at its first foundation by the bequests of the ancient earls of Cornwall. For the name of Rial-ton or Ryal-ton (if it consists of those particles), it signifies the royal, kingly, or princely town, as pertaining heretofore to the king of England or earls of Cornwall ; and suitable to this etymology it elaimeth the jurisdiction and royalty over the whole hundred of Pider. So that whosoever is now farmer thereof, is by custom its head bailiff, as the prior of St. Pedyr at Bodmin was; from whose font-name the same is still denominated Pider (id est, Peter, as formerly said), the which farmer or bailiff is steward ofthe Court Baron of the said hundred or decima, and also of the Court Leet held within the jurisdiction or precincts of the manor aforesaid, and his substitutes constantly attend the service of both. To remove an action-at-law de- pending in the Court Leet of this manor, the writ must thus be directed : Senescallo et Ballivo manerii nostri de Rialton in comitatu de Cornubi\u00e6 salutem. To re-"], [274, "232 ST. COLOMB MINOR. move an action out of hundred court, whereof as I said the farmer of this manor is lord, the writ must be thus directed : \" Senescallo et Ballivo hundredi et libertatis de Peder, in comitatu Cornubi\u00e6, salutem.\" When the priory of St. Peder at Bodmin was dis solved, 26 Henry VIII. and those lands vested in the crown, one John Mundy, barrister-at-law, (son of John Mundy, sheriff of London 6 Henry VIII. afterwards Sir John Mundy, Knight, Lord Mayor of London 14 Henry VIII.) was sent down from London to be senes chal or steward of this manor of Ryalton and hundred of Pider. In which capacity he demeaned himself so well, temp. Elizabeth, that when the set-off of tbe last prior for ninety-nine years expired, and Mr. Mundy's son succeeded in the same office as his father, was in this place, at such time as James I. by statute prohibited the granting of church lands at lease for longer than twenty-one 3Tears under the old rent, Mr. Mundy took a lease thereof from the Crown for that term, viz. of 60/. per annum, and his posterity renewing or retaking the same as those leases expired, thereby this estate, worth about 1000/. per annum, continued in this family till some time after the restoration of Charles the Second, when Sir Francis Godolphin, Knight, by favour of that King, took a reversion or new set thereof, before Mr. Mundy's expired, on condition of doubling the rent from 60/. to 120/. per annum, so that Sir William Godolphin, Bart. is now in possession thereof; and the Right Hon. Sid ney Lord Godolphin was created Baron Godolphin of Ryalton, 33 Charles II. whereby this family of Mundy are comparatively undone, notwithstanding they were stout Cavaliers and opposers of Cromwell and the Par liament army to their utmost power and strength. Well therefore doth the royal Psalmist advise all men not to put their trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom is no help. The arms of Mundy are, in a field, three lozenges, on a chief three eagle's legs erased."], [275, "233 ST. COLOMB MINOR. The mansion-house at Ryalton wherein Mr. Mundy dwelt, was much beautified and augmented by prior Thomas Vivian, to which belongs a strong prison and dungeon for putting debtors in durance. Query, whe ther this barton of Ryalton payeth tithes to the impro priator i All priories, monasteries, religious houses, &c. above the yearly value of 200/. per annum, being ex empted from it by the statute 31 Henry VIIL chiefly because the same were given for and applied to chari table uses and the maintenance of the poor; and verily, if the name Ryalton be compounded of those syllables ry-all-ton, it signifies give or bestow all town, or a town that gave or bestowed all its revenues to the poor, and pious uses. And that the reader may know in what manner poor men were sent to such religious houses to be fed and maintained during life, as penitentiaries or otherwise, by their superiors, or such as had power to visit the same, I will set down an instance or example, out of Fox's Acts and Monuments, page 53, temp. Henry VIII. contained in a letter from John Langland, Bishop of Lincoln, 1524, to the Abbot of Ensham, viz. \" My loving brother, I recommend me hearty unto you, and whereas I have according to law sent this bearer T. R. to perpetual penance within your monastery of Ensham, there to live as a penitent and not otherwise; 1 pray you nevertheless, and according to the law com mand you, to receive him, and see you order him there according to his injunctions, which he will show you if you require the same. As for his lodging, he will bring it with him, and his meat and drink he must have as you give of your alms; and if he can so order himself by his labour within your house in your business, whereby he may deserve meat and drink, so may you order him as you see convenient to his deserts, so that he pass not the precinct of your monastery. And thus, fare you heartily well. From my place, &c.\" Thin injunction of penance was, I. To fast every Friday during life, taking no other sustenance than bread and ale after it;"], [276, "234 ST.

At Towan in this parish, is that well-known place called Newquay, a pretty safe road and anchorage place for such ships as trade in St. George's Channel, and also a convenient place for a fishing trade, were the inhabitants disposed to adventure therein. At Hendra, also Hendre, in this parish, synonymous words, old, ancient town, is the dwelling of John Ton kyn, Gent, that married Keen of Roach ; his father the heir of Cock, by whom he had this place ; his grand father Tregian, originally descended from the Tonkyns of St. Agnes. Trevedick, also Trevithick, words ofan^signification, id est, rustic or farmers' town, is the dwelling of Nicho las Polamonter, Gent, (so called from Polla-monter in Newland.) TONKIN has not, again, any thing of the least importance differ ent from Mr. Hals. THE EDITOR. Rialton is the object of highest importance in this parish. Its antiquities are not much known ; but when Mr. Sidney Godolphin was created Earl of Godolphin, his son, who had married Henrietta Churchill, eldest daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, assumed the appellation of Lord Rialton, and Lady Rialton was one of the ladies of the bedchamber to Queen Anne.

The properly belonged to the late Mr. Thomas Raw lings of Padstow, having probably been acquired when lands were sold by the duchy to redeem the land-tax, but it was alienated on his decease. New Quay, mentioned by Mr. Hals as a pretty safe road and anchorage for vessels, and also as a convenient place for establishing a fishery, is become a successful station for sea nets. In Lord Dunstanville's edition of Ca rew, p. 357, it is stated, \" The place was called New Quay, because in former times the neighbours attempted to supply the defects of nature by art, in making there a quay for the road of shipping, which conceit they still retain, although want of means in themselves or in the plan have left the effect in nubibus. The quay has now .been many years constructed, but I apprehend it is not capable of receiving any other than small vessels.

On the eastern side adjoining to the Downs, the rocks are quartzose, but the greater part of this parish is com posed of slates belonging to the calcareous series, which extend to the sea shore. At Tremper Bridge, and in the islands lying at the entrances of St. Columb Porth, beds of black limestone occur, associated with talc, schist, and blue slates. The most interesting feature, however, of this parish"], [278, "236 CONSTANTINE. is the testaceous sandstone at New Quay, and on the shores of Fistral Bay. The land adjacent to the sea at those places is covered with sand, which above high water mark is lapidified, as is also a bed of pebbles on which the sand sometimes rests. For the particulars of this phenomenon the first and the fourth volumes of the Cornwall Geological Transactions may be consulted. CONSTANTINE. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath upon the north, part of Stithians ; west, Gwendron; south, Hayleford channel and Mawnan ; east, Mabe and Bu dock. It is also commonly Cus-ten-ton, i. e. wood stone town, a place heretofore notable for woods and stones, and 1 take it an unpleasant strag of moor-stones and rocks are still visible upon a great part of the lands here. Perhaps it is the Crostedeton mentioned in the Domesday Roll. Otherwise it was taxed under Tre wardevi or Penwarne. The name Constantine is de rived from the Latin Constantia. In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, 1294, Ecclesia de Sancto Constantino, was valued to first fruits 10/. Vicar ejusdem 40/. in Decanatu de Kerryer.

The titular guardian of this church, St. Constantine, Emperor"], [279, "237 CONSTANTINE. of Rome, was the first emperor in the world that professed Christianity. He was the son of Constantius Chlorus Emperor of Rome ; first an officer of war under the Em peror Aurelian, against Coill or Coillus, King or Duke of Colchester in Britain, (called by some writers Caer- Collyn, Caer-Col-lyn, i. e. the city or castle on the neck of the lake, or bosom of waters, it being situate on the confluence of the Medway river), which Coil, having refused to pay the tribute due to the Senate of Rome, caused that province to revolt; but Constantius forced hiin into a submission, when soon after he died ; and Constantius is said to have married his only daughter and heir Helen, by whom he had all her father's lands and territories, Anno Dom. 2S9- By her he had issue Constantine, who followed the wars in his father's time against Maxentius ; and lying on his bed, before a bat tle, a dream or vision appeared to him in shape of an angel, holding in his hand a shining red cross, and call ing to him with a loud voice \" Constantine ! Er tovtu> vt<a, in hoc signo vinces, i. e. under this sign or banner thou shalt have victory.\" Whereupon he commanded a red cross to be pourtrayed in all his banners, called the laba num, and soon after gave battle to Maxentius at Pont Milvium, in Italy, where his [the latter's] army was routed, and himself drowned in that river. The success of which battle so wrought upon Constantine that he forthwith turned Christian, and was baptized by Pope Silvester, Bishop of Rome. I In this parish, at Tre-warde-vi, as taxed in Domesday Roll, (i. e. the shining or flying guard town, or the in dignation, or wrath guard town,) is the dwelling of John Trewren, Esq. i. e. the wren's town, who married Vyvyan of Trelowarren ; his father Rice; and giveth for his arms, Azure, three Besants. The present possessor Trewren, Esq. that married Prisk of Helston. In this parish is the dwelling of Edward Chapman, Gent, that married Bligh of Botadon."], [280, "238 CONSTANTINE. This gentleman received from God's holy angels a wonderful preservation in the beginning of the reign of William III. when returning from Redruth towards his own house about seven miles distant, with his servant, late at night, and both much intoxicated with liquor, (as himself told me,) nevertheless having so much sense left as to consider that they were to pass through several tin mines or shafts near the highway, on the south-east side of Redruth town, alighted both from their horses, and led them in their hands after them. The servant went somewhat before his master, the better to keep the right road in those places, which occasioned Mr. Chapman's turning aside somewhat out of the way, whereby in the dark he suddenly fell into a tin mine above twenty fa- thom deep, at whose fall into this precipice his horse started back and escaped ; in this pit or hole Mr. Chap- man fell directly down fifteen fathoms without let or intermission, where meeting a cross drift (above six fathom of water under it), he in his campaign coat, sword, and boots, was miraculously stopped, where coming to himself, he was not much sensible of any hurt or bruises he had received, through the terror and horror of his fall; when, considering in what condition he was, he resolved to make the best expedient he could to prevent his falling further down, (where, by the drop- ping or reesing of stones and earth moved by his fall, he understood there was much water under,) so he rested his back against one side of the mine, and his feet against the other, athwart the hole, and in order to fix his hands on some solid thing, drew his sword out of its sheath and thrust the blade thereof as far as he could into the opposite part of the shaft, and so in great pain and terror rested himself. The suddenness of this accident, and the horse's es caping in the dark as aforesaid, was the reason why Mr. Chapman's servant, who went before him, did not so soon find him wanting as otherwise he might, which as"], [281, "239 CONSTANTINE. soon as he did, he went back the road way in quest of him, calling him aloud by his name ; but receiving no answer, nor being able to find the horse, he concluded his master had rode home to his house some other way, whereupon, giving up all further search after him, he hastened home to Constantine, expecting to have met him there; but, contrary to his expectations, found he was not returned. Whereupon his servants, early next morning, went forth to inquire after him, and suspecting {as it happened) he might be fallen into some tin-shafts about Redruth, hastened thither, where, before they arrived, some tinners had taken into custody his horse (with bridle and saddle on) which they found grazing on the Wastrell Downs. Whereupon, consulting toge ther about this tragical mishap, it was resolved forth with that some of those tinners, for reward, should search the most dangerous shafts in order to find his body either living or dead ; accordingly they employed themselves that day till about four o'clock in the afternoon without any discovery of him. Finally, one person returned to his company, and told them that at a considerable distance he heard a kind of human voice under ground; to which place they repaired, and making loud cries to the hole of the shaft, he forthwith answered them that he was there alive, and prayed their assistance in order to deliver him from that tremendous place; whereupon, immediately they set on tackle-ropes and windlass on the old shaft, so that a tinner descended to the place where he rested, and having candle-light with him bound him fast in a rope, and so drew him safely to land, where, to their great admiration and joy, it ap peared he had neither broke any bone, or was much bruised by the fall ; verifying together the attribute of Divine Omnipotence that nothing is impossible with God, \u2014 and that old English proverb, that drunkards sel dom take hurt ; for, as the tinners said, if he had fallen but two or three feet lower, he must inevitably have"], [282, "240 CONSTANTINE. been drowned in the water. But maugre all those ad verse accidents, after about seventeen hours stay in the pit aforesaid, he miraculously escaped death and lived many years after, and would recount this history with as much pleasure as men do the ballads of Chevy Chase or Rosamond Clifford. In this parish is the dwelling of James Trefusis, Gent. that married Worth ; his father Penarth, originally descended from Trefusis of Trefusis in Mylor, as I am informed. Moreover, it must be remembered in this place, of St. Constantine, that he was the first prince that ever en dowed Christian churches beyond the seas with stand ing rents, lands, and revenues, and also gave to the church the tenth part of all lands and goods he possessed himself, whereupon the clergy claimed tithes therein by a law. And such officers or publicans as gathered it were called Decumani, (as Appian saith) ; for before that time tithes were only taken by the Senate of Rome and Emperor for the supply of the legions and armies in time of war, and not otherwise. Afterwards, Constan tine made a law that all princes under his dominion should give the tenth part of their revenues towards the maintenance of churches and temples, as himself had done. From this law and example Ethelwulf, the second sole Saxon monarch in England, Anno Dom. 838, in the year 855 (as Ingulphus, Abbat of Croyland, in his his tory of Britain, 1066, informs us), by royal charter con firmed the tithes of all his lands on the church in those words : \" Decimam partem terr\u00e6 me\u00e6,\" &c. ; and this was done (gratuito consensu) by consent of his princes and prelates. This donation afterwards was confirmed by King Ethelred. \" Nemo auferat ii Deo quod ad Deum pertinet, et pr\u00e6cessores nostri concesserunt,\" &c. After ward King Athelstan made a law, Anno Dom. 926, that every man should pay tithes out of all the goods he"], [283, "241 CONSTANTINE. possessed, as Jacob did ; which Edmund Ironside con firmed under penalty of being accursed, 1016. After wards King Edward the Confessor, 1046, ordained more expressly that all tithes should be justly paid to the elder or mother churches, viz. de garba, grege equaruin, pul lis, vaccis, vitulis, caseo, lacte, vellis, porceilis, apibus, bosco, prato, aquis, molendinis, parcis, vivariis, piscariis, virgultis, hortis, negotionibus, et omnibus rebus, quas dederit Dominus, &c. ; which decree or statute was after wards ratified by William the Conqueror and his suc cessors. (See more of Tithes under Keye.) TONKIN. Tonkin adds nothing to Mr. Hals in respect to this parish except the following short account of the manor of Merthyr or Merther. Mr. Tonkin cites from Carew, (p. 128 of Lord Dunstanville's edition,) \" Rogerus de Carminou ten. 20 part. seo. milit. extra 10 part, illius 20 in Wynnenton, Merthyr, et Tamerton.\" This Sir Roger de Carminow, for he was a knight, left this ma nor inter alia to his eldest son and heir Sir Thomas Car minow, of Carminow, Knight, who, leaving only three daughters his heirs, this manor fell to the share of Phi lippa, the wife of John Treworthen. THE EDITOR. Merther is now the property of Sir Richard Vyvyan, and has been for a considerable time in his family. The family of Trewren of Trewardreva, is now I believe extinct; the name is usually pronounced Trew-ren, and certainly has not the etymology which Mr. Hals imputes to it. Carwithenick in this parish was the seat of Mr. Chap man, preserved almost by a miracle according to Mr. Hals's account, received from himself, when he fell into a shaft, see page 238.

He married one of the heiresses of Pri deaux, of Gurlyn in St. Erth. It is said by some that St. Cornelius the Centurian is patron of this parish ; if so, the name Cornelly is pro bably from him. Nearly the wiiole of this parish is in cluded within the manor of Grogith or Crogith. THE EDITOR. Francis Gregor, son and heir of John Gregor and Elizabeth Moyle, married a daughter of William Harris of Pickwell in Devonshire ; and their son Francis Gregor, born in 1728, left two sons, Francis Gregor, sheriff of Cornwall in 1788, and member for the county from 1790 to 1806, and the Rev. William Gregor. Mr. Francis Gregor first married the eldest daughter of Mr. William Masterman, of Restormal, who had married a Cornish lady, and made a large fortune by the practice of the law, as a solicitor in London, and afterwards represented Bodmin in Parliament. Mr. Gregor mar ried secondly Miss Urchuarth from Scotland, but died in 1815 without any family; and his brother, the Rev.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. Near Tregony Bridge, a fine-grained, glossy, and very fissile blue slate is exposed in a quarry, which appears to be the prevailing rock of this small parish. This slate probably contains beds of massive lamellar rocks, as the same kind of slate does in the adjoining parishes, but they are not in this particular district visible on the surface. All these rocks belong to the calcareous series. CRANTOCK. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Pedyr, and hath upon the north the Irish sea; on the west, St. Cuthbert; south, Newland ; east, St. Columb Minor. As for this compound name, it is plain British ; Cran-tock, Cran dock, id est, a place that heretofore bore or carried beech trees. But others will have the name to be de rived from its pretended titular guardian, one St. Caran-"], [288, "246 CRANTOCK. tochus, a British disciple of St. Colomb's, of whom I must plead non sum informatus ; otherwise than that Carantodhius in old British, Scots, and Irish, is love, affection, tenderness. Cran-teck is fair beech trees. More sure I am that this district, at the time of the Domesday Roll, was taxed under the name of Ryalton or Cargoll ; and in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, 1294, into the value of church livings in Cornwall, Ecclesia Sancti Carentini in De canatu de Pidre is thus rated, the vicar 40s. and the nine prebends, then extant in this collegiate church, were thus taxed, viz. John de Woolrington, 53s. Ad. ; John de Cattelyn, 30s. ; Nicholas Strange, 30s. ; John de Ing ham, 40s.; Ralph de Trethinick, 53s. Ad. ; David de Monton, 40s.; William de Patefond, 40s.; John Lovell, 30s. ; John de Glasney, 6s. 8d. ; in all 19/. Ss. Ad. From whence I gather this collegiate church had great reve nues then belonging to it, since it is higher rated to the Pope's annats than any other church then in Cornwall. However, before Richard II.'s time it was wholly im propriated or appropriated to its founder and endower, the Prior of St. Pedyr at Bodmin ; the vicar subsisting only by a small salary of 61. and oblations and obven tions ; for which reason it is not mentioned in Wolsey's inquisition, or Valor Beneficiorum. Which collegiate church being dissolved by the statute 26 Henry VIII. and the revenues vested in the crown, the impropriator Mr. Buller is patron and rec tor of the vicarage church now extant ; the incumbent Warne, who comparatively subsists upon his bounty; and the parish rated to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1696, 7S/. 16s. By reason of the great quantities of sea-sand blown up from the Gannell creek by the wind (tempore Ed ward VI. as Holinshed saith), the place where the college stood is now scarce discernible; only a conse-"], [289, "247 CRANTOCK. crated arched well of water bears the name of St. Am brose's Well, contiguous therewith. Speed and Dugdale, in their Monasticon Anglica num, tell us that at its dissolution, 26 Henry VIII. it con sisted only of four prebends, whose revenues were valued only at 89/. 15s. from whence it appears five preben dary's rents were dismembered from it before that time ; and since its suppression the lands of those four pre bends have passed from the crown to Louis, from Louis to Goldingham, frormGoldingham to Lutterell, now in possession thereof. The vicarage church of Crantock is commonly called lan-guna, or lan-gona, that is to say the hay temple or church ; and is, suitable to its name, situate in a large hay meadow of very rich land, containing about three acres, where, by ancient custom the vicar's cattle de pasture over the dead bodies interred therein. Tre-ganell, or Tre-gonell, in this parish, that is to say, the canal or channel town, situate upon a creek of the north sea, gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen surnamed Tregonell or Treganell, whose three daughters and heirs, tempore James I. were mar ried to Bauden, Pallamonter, and Penpoll, who gave for their arms, in a field Argent, three Ogresses between two cottices in] fess Sable, as many Cornish daws Proper. John Tregonell, or'Treganell, \u2014 of his posterity (now transnominated to Tregonwell), was a younger brother of this house, tempore Henry VII. who had his first education in this college of Crantock at a cheap rate, (as any may be had at Aberdeen or Glasgow in Scot land,) from whence he went to Oxford, and proceeded so far in book-erudition as to take his degree of Doctor of the Civil and Canon Law, and acquired such perfection and fame therein, that he was chosen proctor for Henry VIII. in that costly divorce betwixt him and Queen Catherine of Spain; by whom he was also"], [290, "248 CRANTOCK. knighted, and for his labour and pains therein had a pension of 40/. per annum settled upon him during his life; and afterwards, upon the resignation of that annuity, and the payment of a thousand pounds, he had by that king settled upon him and his heirs the site and de mesne of Midleton, a mitred abbey in Dorset, of great value, which his posterity enjoy to this day, himself heing buried in Midleton church 1540. He had issue John, afterwards knighted, sheriff of Dorset, 1 Philip and Mary; who married , and had issue John Tre gonell, Esq. sheriff of Dorset 2 James I., who also mar ried , and had issue John Tregonell, Esq. sheriff of that county 15 James I., when Francis Vyvyan, Esq. was sheriff of Cornwall. Tre-ago, also Tre-agho, synonymous words, in this parish, that is to say, the fishing spear or barbed iron for stabbing fish, used it seems heretofore in the gannell or channell haven contiguous therewith, by the owners of this little barton and manor, and from thence deno minated; tri-aeo is in Latin-Cornish a threefold action, or acting or making ; tre-ago, the town of action. From this place was also denominated its lord, of an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed De Tre-ago, who at his own proper cost and charge built the south aile in the now vicarage church of Crantock, and appropriated the same to his family or heirs and assigns for ever, by charging those lands with the repair and maintenance thereof (for ever) as at this day they do, without being chargeable to the parish of Crantock. The sole daugh ter and heir of those Treagos, as I am informed, was married to Mynors, tempore Edward IV. who made it the seat of his family ; as afterwards, tempore Elizabeth, the issue male of Mynors failing, his only daughter and heir was married to Tregian, and Tregian's posterity, by ill conduct, wasted this barton and manor of Treago, and sold the same for the payment of bills of cost to John Cooke, Gent, attorney-at-law, tempore James I.; and"], [291, "249 CRANTOCK. in like manner Thomas Cooke, Esq. within fifty years after the death of his father or grandfather, sold this place and most of his other lands to Hugh Boscawen of Tregothnan, Esq. now in possession thereof, viz. temp. Charles II. This place was heretofore privileged with the juris diction of a court leet, and a strong prison for keeping prisoners for debt in durance, though now I take it to be destitute of both. The arms of Mynors were, Sable, an eagle displayed Or, on a chief Azure, bordered Ar gent, a chevron between two crescents above and a rose beneath Or. This last bearing on the chief, and mar shalled within the escutcheon was, as tradition saith, the coat armour of Treago; and such sort of marshalling divers coats Nicholas Upton doth approve of, especially where a man hath large possessions by his mother, and but a small patrimony from his father; as perhaps the case was thus with Mynors. In this parish is the port, haven, or creek, called the gonell or ganell, that is to say the canal or channel of the Tremporth river, leading into the sea, wherein much fish and fowl is caught ; and many times ships frequent this place for trade and safety, the sea here winding up itself between the lands about a mile in the country. It also, at full sea, affordeth entrance and anchorage for ships of the greatest burthen, if conducted by a pilot that understands the course of the ganell or channel; at the head of which, as a ligament fastening the pa rishes of Lower St. Colomb and Crantock together, is a county bridge, called Trem-porth ; that is to say, the tying, fastening, terrifying, or making afraid gate, cove, or entrance, so aptly named perhaps from the rapid con fluence of this channel or river in winter season, before the bridge was built, where it meets the salt waters, and the softness of the clay and sea-moore marsh there on which the bridge is situate. I find William Smith, Esq. of Crantock in Cornwall*"], [292, "250 CRANTOCK. (which I take to be of this place,) was created a baronet by Charles I., 27 December 1642, patent 418.

TONKIN. Trencreek is interpreted by Mr. Carew the town ofthe Burrow, by which I apprehend he means a dwelling near some creeig, byrig or tumulus; for that is the import of the word Trencreeig, from whence an old family of gentlemen, now extinct, were denominated, who gave for their arms, Argent, a cross patee, surmounted with a chevron Sable. But the tumulus importing their name must have been erected since the doctrine of Christianity was brought into this land ; for before that time graves were called beths,* veths, or byrigs, from whenceour mo dern words burrow or bury. The Brigantes mentioned by Tacitus were so denominated from their lofty tumuli, byrigs, or graves. All the lands in this parish are either held from or in parts of the Great Duchy.

THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals commits an apparent mistake in assigning the advowson of this parish to Mr. St. Aubyn at the period of Wolsey's Valuation, and then stating that it was acquired by purchase at the general dissolution of religious houses. It is probable that the advowson was acquired when the alien priories, or all such houses as were cells in England subject to monasteries abroad, were given to the King by an Act of Parliament, 2d year of Henry V. A. D. 1415. See the statute in original Norman French, vol. vi. p. 986, of Dugdale's Monasticon, London, 1830; and in Latin, vol. ix. p. 281, of Rymer's F\u0153dera. Sir John St. Aubyn, mentioned by Mr. Hals as in possession of Clowance at the time of his writing, repre sented the County in Parliament, and acquired popula rity by opposing the administration of Sir Robert Wal pole. He married Catherine, daughter, and eventually coheiress of Sir Nicholas Morice, of Werrington, and the Lady Catherine Herbert, and great-granddaughter of Sir William Morice, Secretary of State at the Resto ration. This lady brought a fortune of ten thousand pounds, which, the Editor remembers to have heard from a very aged member of the family, were conveyed in two carts"], [308, "266 CROWAN. from Werrington to Clowance, all in half crowns, and that he assisted in taling them. But in addition to ten thousand pounds Miss Morice also received at her marriage, or afterwards succeeded to, the manor of Stoke Damarel, on the Eastern bank of the Tamar, near Hamoaze, and purchased not a long time before from the Wises, a respectable family in the South of Devon, for eleven thousand five hundred pounds. On this manor all the dock yards and government buildings have been constructed, and the whole town of Plymouth Dock, now Devonport, has been built, toge ther with Morris Town, Stoke, 8lc. so that the annual income has risen to perhaps three or four fold the ori ginal purchase money. This Sir John St. Aubyn left a son of bis own name, and three daughters, who married Basset, Molesworth, and Buller. The son, Sir John St. Aubyn, had also the honour of representing the County in Parliament. He married Miss Wingfield, from the North of England; and dying in October 1772, left his estate to an only son, the pre sent Sir John St. Aubyn. He left also four daughters, who have married Prideaux, Molesworth, Leonard, and White. Mr. Lysons states that the church of Crowan was given by William Earl of Gloucester to the Priory of St. James, in Bristol, which was a Cell to Tewkesbury Abbey. If that is so, Mr. Hals must be entirely mis taken in assigning the advowson to a St. Aubyn at the time of Wolsey's Valuation. Mr. Lysons also says, that Kerthen, in this parish, be longed to a family of the name of Cowlins, from whom it passed to the Godolphins by a marriage. Leland was entertained at Kerthen in the course of making his Itinerary, by a Mr. Godolphin, who resided there. Leland, however, writes the name Cardine."], [309, "267 CROWAN. In submitting to the press by far the greater part of Mr. Hals' Manuscripts, and also of Mr. Tonkin's Manu script, in so far as it differs from the former, the Editor has been especially careful to preserve all such anecdotes and narratives of events as may tend to illustrate the manners or the opinions of the times to which they re late, adding to them many that have come to his know ledge from other sources. Just a hundred years ago such a series of events took place with reference to the possession of Skewis, a farm in this parish, as would induce any one of the present time to think that he must be living in another land, under a different administration of the laws, and in a totally dissimilar state of society. Skewis had been, for I know not how long, the free hold patrimony of a succession of yeomen proprietors of the name of Rogers. There were now two brothers, the elder married and lived on the farm, but without a family, the younger brother, Henry Rogers, married and had se veral children. He carried on for several years in Hel ston the trade of a pewterer, then of considerable im portance to Cornwall, although it is now lost. A large portion of the tin was then exported in the shape of pew ter made into plates, dishes, &c. all of which have been superseded by earthenware. At the first introduction of earthenware, provincially called dome, it was a popular cry to destroy the dome, and to bring back the use of tin. He had for some years retired to this parish. I have made many diligent inquiries about Henry Rogers, and they have not gone to represent him as a bad man, but as one little in the habit of restraining his passions, of great bodily strength, and of what is termed a wilful disposition ; and his prejudices were probably supported by an opinion, still prevalent among country people, that freehold lands, which have once descended to au heir cannot be alienated by any possessor without the concurrence of his heir."], [310, "268 CROWAN. The elder brother died, when a will was produced giving all the freehold property to his widow, whose maiden name was Millett. Henry Rogers averred, and possibly believed, that the will was spurious, and would be invalid at all events. Under that impression, and despising legal remedies, he waited for an opportunity when his sister-in-law was from home; he then turned some female servants out of the house, and took forcible possession. The widow of course appealed to the law, with the voice of the whole country, however, against her; and it is universally reported that Sir John St. Aubyn, the principal gentleman of the parish, would have sup ported Rogers in a legal proceeding. However that may be, he prepared for violence, and refused to yield up pos session when judgment was given against him ; so that the Sheriff was at last directed to eject him by force. But Rogers got several persons, ignorant and lawless as himself, to remain with him in the house, which had been barricaded and adapted for defence, and great numbers of people, partly from curiosity, but in part also to countenance his resistance, having assembled on tbe spot, the civil power was completely resisted, and two men killed by shots from the house ; the Under Sheriff himself having narrowly escaped, \u2014 as he states in bis evidence, rather ludicrously, that the discharge of a gun from the house burnt his wig and singed his face. This happened on the 18th of June, 1734. On the following day the Under Sheriff came back, assisted by some soldiers, who were fired on and one killed. They returned the fire, but without effect. And then, which would appear almost incredible, Rogers was allowed to remain in quiet possession, after these murders, till March of the following year, when he was again blockaded by soldiers ; and ihe siege, 1 apprehend, continued for several days, with the loss of two more men, when at last cannon were brought from Pendennis Castle. On the night following their arrival, Rogers"], [311, "CROWAN. 269 contrived to effect an escape. He travelled on foot, and got as far as Salisbury, with the intention, as he stated, of making his case known to the King. Whatever might have been the opinions of gentlemen, and educated persons, on the abstract merit of his case, it became impossible for them not to join in bringing to condign punishment one who had thus taken away the lives of innocent persons, and set at equal defiance the laws of God and man. Sir John St. Aubyn now took an active part in endea vouring to secure the fugitive, and being through his marriage connected with the Herberts Earls of Pem broke, who resided in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, handbills descriptive of Rogers were circulated round that town. I have always heard that a postboy, driving homewards a return postchaise, was accosted by a stout man walking with a gun in his hand, requesting to be taken in. The boy drove him to the inn, where he pro cured a bed; but the circumstances and description had excited strong suspicion, and he was secured in his sleep. The prisoner was of course removed to Cornwall. He was there convicted of murder, together with John Street, who seems to have been his principal partisan, and both made an atonement for their offences with their lives. Through the favour of Lord Hardwicke, I have pro cured a copy of the evidence, and a portion of the charge given to the Grand Jury, in reference to those prisoners, by his Lordship's grandfather, the justly-cele brated first Earl of Hardwicke and Lord Chancellor.

The Under-sheriff expostulated with him, and told him if he had a right, his best way was to submit to the law. Sheriff read the proclamation. Rogers asked him to drink a dram; he went for it, and in the meantime his wife held the gun ; guns were fired. 19 June went again. Under-sheriff told him he hoped he was in a better mind now, and would deliver him possession. Refused. A gun fired from the house. Soon after, heard it called out that Carpenter was shot in the back, and a soldier shot in the groin. He is a sur geon, and dressed Carpenter; found him shot from about the fourth rib to his buttock ; many slugs and jagged pieces of lead in it. Between two and three hundred men there the first day, and a great many the second day, but not so many. Sir J. St. Aubin having sent out his steward, heard the under-sheriff ask him who were in the house. He said only his own servants.

Was there the first day, aud the Sheriff read and showed him the writ; told Rogers that if he would try the cause again he should be as ready to put him in as to take him out. He was there again the second day. The Sheriff told him he was come again to do his office, and desired him to be easy. Gives the same account, and that the soldiers did not fire till after Carpenter was shot. As to Street. Edward Williams. Was at Skewis House the 19th day of June 1734. Saw John Street there in the house, with a sword in his hand. Kept people in the house, and said he would run body through that offered to go away; said now was the time to do a friend service; as sisted Rogers by keeping persons in by force ; the She riff was then come to demand possession. Street was in the house when the firing was. Rogers's wife was apprehended by the time the Under sheriff\" came to the house. Mr. Black, ensign, was there with the soldiers ; with the others; had orders from the commanding officer to attend the Sheriff. No firing by the soldiers or sheriff's company till Carpenter and a soldier killed. John Ellett was one of the soldiers who went with the Under-sheriff assist him.

Henry Jeffries was corporal to the party. Heard the Under-sheriff read the proclamation, and demand en trance ; when Rogers refused. Carpenter went up and struck at the door; and as he turned about was shot in the back ; he was shot in the leg ; had orders from the Under-sheriff to fire. The Prisoner.

Henry Berriman. 18 day of June saw the sheriff go, and heard him demand entrance ; and the prisoner said he should have none. The next day the Sheriff came with soldiers; but he was two coits cast off; the soldiers were on the eastern side ofthe house; the soldiers fired three rounds ; but he did not see the gun fired out of the house. Carpenter was shot on the eastern side of the house, and he was on the western side of the house ; the Undersheriff desired him to carry him off. Did not see Carpenter receive the shot. Was not on the same side of the house when Carpenter was shot ; as far off as the tower of this town from this place. [Carpenter was on the eastern side of the house when he was shot].

Rode through the town just as the soldiers came with the Sheriff; saw Henry Rogers's wife; was on the south side ofthe house when the firing was first; but that was on the east side of the house; however, thinks he could distinguish whether it came from the house or the soldiers, because the firing from the house was by single pops now and then, and the soldiers shot many together. To his sight and percep tion the first firing was by the soldiers. Can't say any more. He was not on the east of the house at all. A great number of people assembled.

After Carpenter was killed, some of the soldiers had fired on the east side of the house before he went to the west side. Samuel Hatch gives the same account as before of the facts on 18th and 19th June.

An addition which appears to have been made to a charge delivered by Lord Hardwicke, Chief Justice on Western Ciicuit in 1735. Ofthe truth of this observation and ofthe pernicious consequences of lawless force, you of this country have lately had a flagrant but an instructive instance. In that you have seen from what small springs a torrent of vio lence may arise. How people once engaged in such practices, go on from invading the property, to taking away the lives of their fellow subjects; and from an ob stinate contemptuous opposition to the regular decisions of the ordinary Courts of Justice, they advance almost to open rebellion. The honourable and indefatigable endeavours of the gentlemen of this county to reform and suppress such daring outrages cannot be sufficiently commended, and must always be remembered highly to their honour. And happy it is that these endeavours, enforced by the sea sonable and gracious assistance of his majesty, had the desired effect. To consider this affair iu its full extent, it ought on the one hand to be looked upon as a strong proof that the King will make use ofthe extraordinary"], [321, "279 CROWAN. as well as the ordinary powers of his government, only for protection and security of his people ; and on the other hand, that the gentlemen of England will unite in the support of the laws, and of legal, well established government, against all attempts of any kind whatsoever to introduce disorder and confusion. So great were the apprehensions entertained of a man who had in this extraordinary manner, and for months set at defiance the whole authority of the country, that, immediately after his absconding, the magistrates of the hundred issued the following proclamation: Cornwall. \u2014 To all Magistrates, Headboroughs, and Offi- cers of Towns and Parishes, to whom these presents shall come. Whereas several murders have lately been commit- ted by Henry Rogers, of Skewis, in the parish of Crowan, in the county of Cornwall, and whereas the said Henry Rogers and his gang did last night abscond and with- draw themselves from justice, notwithstanding a strict guard of soldiers and others which were placed about the house at Skewis to prevent their escape, and any further mischiefs that might ensue from their wicked in- tentions and intrigues of the said Henry Rogers and his abettors ; And whereas they withdrew from Skewis with their guns and ammunition, whereby it is suspected that they will plunder and ravage the whole county : \u2014 We therefore desire you to transmit this to the next town, that it may go through the whole county, not only that all his Majesty's good and peaceable subjects may be guarded against the said Rogers and his gang, but that they may do their utmost endeavours to apprehend them, and bring them to their trial, that all such horrid practices, which threaten destruction to society and government, may for the future be prevented, the public"], [322, "280 CROWAN. peace preserved, and the authors of such infamous dis orders be brought to condign punishment.

He hath on a whitish fustian frock, with bastard pearl buttons, and a blue riding-coat. Although no one ventured to justify the violence, and especially the murders committed by Rogers, yet long within my remembrance a strong feeling of compassion was generally entertained for him. One of his sons lived to a very advanced age at Penzance, where be procured a scanty living as a saddler, merely employed, I believe, from kindness. In October 1812 I had a long conversation with this old man about his father; and the following are minutes made on the occasion : \" On the 30th of October, 1 8 1 2, 1 called on Mr. Henry Rogers, formerly a saddler at Penzance, but then resid ing there in great poverty, being supported by a small allowance from a club, and by half-a-crown a week given him by the corporation, nominally for yielding up the possession of a house, but in truth to prevent his be coming a common pauper. \" Mr. Henry Rogers was then eighty-four years of age, and remembered the unfortunate transactions at Skewis perfectly well ; he was between seven and eight years old at the time. He recollected going out with his father into the court after there had been some firing. His father had a gun in his hand, and inquired what they wanted. According to the New Style this date would be 1735."], [323, "281 CROWAN. On this his father was fired at, and had a snuff-box and powder-horn broken in his pocket by a ball, whilst he stood on the other side. \" He recollected that whilst he himself was in the bed, several balls came in through the window of the room, and after striking against the wall rolled about on the floor. \" One brother and a sister, who were in the house, went out to inquire what was wanted of their father, and they were not permitted to return. \"On the last night, no one remained in the house but his father, himself, and the servant-maid. In the middle of the night they all went out, and got some distance from the house. In crossing a field, however, they were met by two soldiers, who inquired their business, &c. The maid answered that they were looking for a cow, when they were permitted to proceed. The soldiers had their arms, and his father had his gun. The maid and himself were left at a farm-house in the neighbourhood, and Mr. Rogers proceeded on his way towards London. Mr. Henry Rogers said that he was born in Crowan, and he apprehended so were most of the children; that his father, although bred a pewterer, had for many years occupied land in that parish.\" All these circumstances, after so long an interval, were related to me by the old man with tears in his eyes. It is curious to compare this account of the escape of one man, a woman, and a child, with the proclamation of the next day. On the 8th of January, 1816, I called at Skewis, and saw several holes in the partitions, made by shot ot dif ferent sizes, when Mr. Henry Rogers resisted the law in 1735. I have an extract from a letter written by a Cornish gentleman in May 1735, who states that he had seen Rogers in the prison at Salisbury, when he seemed to re joice in what he had done. And I have found in an ac-"], [324, "282 CROWAN. count-book of my great uncle, Mr. Henry Davies, the following receipt : \" 1st July 1735. Received of Mr. Henry Davies, to wards the taking of Henry Rogers, two pounds two shillings, per Francis Arthur.\" A print of Rogers was soon after published with the following legend : \" Henry Rogers lived at a village called Skewis. He was so ignorant of the reason as well as of the power of the law, that when a decree in Chancery went against him, he resisted all remonstrances, and fortified his house, making loopholes for his muskets, through which he shot two men of the posse comitatus who attended the Under- sheriff. A little after he shot one Hitchens, as he was passing the high road on his private business. He also fired through the window and killed one Toby, and would not suffer his body to be taken away to be buried for some days. At length tbe neighbouring justices of the peace assisted the constables, and procured an aid of some sol- diers, one of whom he killed, and afterwards made his escape ; but at Salisbury, on his way towards London, he was apprehended and brought down to Cornwall, when at the assizes in August 1735 five bills of indictment were found againt him by the grand jury for the five murders aforesaid; to save the court time he was tried only on three of them, and found guilty of every one, before Lord Chief Justice Hardwick. As he lay in gaol after his conviction, the Under-sheriff coming in, he attempted to seize his sword, with a resolution to kill him ; swearing he should die easy if he could succeed in that design. He was attended by several clergymen ; but they could make no impression on his brutal stupidity, and he died at the gallows without any remorse.\""], [325, "283 CROWAN. Extract made at the British Museum July the 8th, 1812, from the Weekly Miscellany, by Richard Hooker, of the Middle Temple, Esq. for Saturday Aug. the 9th, 1735, No. cxxxix. Launceston, August 1. This day came on before the Lord Chief Justice Hard wick, the trials of Henry Rogers and John Street, one of his assistants, for murders committed in opposing the Sheriff of Cornwall in the execution of his office. Rogers was arraigned upon five indictments, and Street upon two. The trials began about seven in the morning and ended about two in the afternoon. Rogers was tried upon the three first indictments, and being found guilty on all three, the Court thought it unnecessary to proceed upon the other two. Street was found guilty of the two indictments against him. And they both received sen tence of death before the Court rose. The Counsel for the king were Mr. Serjeant Chappie, Mr. Fortescue, jun. The Counsel for the criminals Mr. Pratt and Mr. Draper. The Solicitor for the Treasury Richard Paxton, Esq. was also there on the part of the Crown, he being sent down purposely to prosecute the affair. At the assizes at Launceston Henry Rogers and John Street received sentence of death for a murder they com mitted in opposing the Sheriff of Cornwall in the execu tion of his office, and were executed on the 6th of Au gust 1735. They seemed very penitent, particularly Ro gers, who did not care for any sustenance but bread and water. He said he was guilty of one of the murders, but knew nothing of the other; but had it been in his power he would have killed as many more, and thought he committed no crime. Street, who was his servant,"], [326, "284 CROWAN. had little to say, but that what he did was to defend his master, and he was willing to die, for by the course of years he could not live much longer, and be hoped God would receive his poor soul. And lastly, I subjoin an address to the parish of Crowsn, by Sir John St. Aubyn, the gentleman whom I have mentioned as one of the opponents of Sir Robert Walpole's administration. \"As I am obliged to attend at the assizes, I must ear nestly recommend the care of the parish in my absence to you, and hope that you will do your endeavours to prevent the very great expense and mischief which must otherwise fall upon us ; although you do not at present seem to perceive the danger that threatens us ; for the outrage and murder which happened in our parish have justly alarmed the government, and induced his ma jesty to issue out a proclamation, wherein he offers a reward of two hundred pounds for apprehending Henry Rogers, and one hundred pounds for each of the other offenders, together with a pardon to any who shall dis cover and apprehend them. He likewise commands all civil magistrates, upon pain of his majesty's displeasure, to be diligent in suppressing this riot, and bringing the authors of it to the punishment which their crimes de serve. In obedience to this, I think myself obliged, in the faithful discharge of my duty for the preservation of the public peace, and the good of our own parish in par ticular, to admonish you and the principal inhabitants of it, to give me your aid and assistance in this dangerous and troublesome affair. His Majesty, as he declares in the proclamations, being firmly resolved to put an effectual stop to such enormous practices, hath by his warrant from the Secretary of War, sent orders to the commanders of regiments of soldiers at Exeter, to send to the Sheriff so many soldiers as he shall require and think sufficient"], [327, "285 CROWAN. to suppress this notorious violation of the laws of the land, and which certainly will be done by force of arms, if it cannot be stopped by a gentle and careful process. This is a true and exact state of cause; and whoever considers itwith due temper, must be filled with the most melancholy apprehensions of the mischief that must hap pen, if every good subject and christian does not endea vour to keep off this evil, by endeavouring, as far as his influence can prevail, to make the usual method of bringing crimes to justice effectual. It is for this rea son I now write this letter to you, which I hope you will read with serious attention more than once, that it may have a good effect upon you. I myself can foresee, and I wish you likewise could, the dreadful inconve nience and expense of a regiment of soldiers sent down and quartered upon us; particularly this parish, being the unfortunate place of this disorder, must, in a much heavier manner, feel the burthen of it. Consider the charges and the trouble of having every house in the parish filled with soldiers ; consider what must be the consequence of abetting and supporting Rogers, whose house will be fired about his ears, and those lives which may be lost if he continues in his extravagance. Take notice, that I have done my duty as justice of the peace and a parishioner ; and if you all likewise do yours, by encouraging a proper subjection to authority, and aid ing the civil magistrates in discovering and bringing the offenders to justice, these dismal calamities may be prevented. 1 think more reasonable to advise you of this, because there is too general a mistake and preju dice, or rather vicious encouragement shown, and that too by many who should and do know better, to the un happy author of this disturbance. To pity the unfortu nate is a virtuous character, even to those whose vices have made them so ; but at the same time we ought to detect their crimes, and it is for the public good they"], [328, "286 CROWAN. should be punished ; and this consideration ought to prevail over the concern we may feel for a private per son. Murder is a crime of the basest nature, and what the law in common cases never forgives ; but when it is committed on any officer in the execution of his duty, and in supporting the usurpation of another's right, and what the law shall determine such, it is certainly a more complicated guilt. Whosoever abets a murderer, or does what he can to conceal and defend him from jus tice, is in the eye of God a murderer himself in cold blood. To justify a murderer is the strongest indication of a most base temper; and whosoever does not cry out against the misguided spirit of the people in behalf of Henry Rogers, deserves that character. Whilst the law suit was depending all people were at liberty to weigh on either side. It does at first sight seem a little hard that one brother should give away an estate from ano ther; and there must be some strong provocation to make it appear reasonable; but the circumstances of the whole case are not known, and therefore no man is able to form a true judgement of it; not even to pass harsh censures on particular persons ; but when the law has determined right, all people must submit to that de termination ; otherwise no man is secure in his property, but a number of idle resolute fellows may wrest it from him, and declare that in their opinion he has an unjust title to it. So that if you give your estate by will unequally among your children, as they may have be haved more or less dutiful to you, that which has the least may take the other's part from him ; or another relation may possibly hire such another mob, to take away the whole from them. We shall not at such times see property determined by judge and jury, but by force of arms ; and the richest and most powerful man will be able to swallow up all the estates of his lesser neigh bours. The law is the only protection of our lives and"], [329, "287 CROWAN. estates, and if that is once set aside, we must hold them only by the base sanction of a giddy rabble. The law therefore should be strictly maintained by all such who have any possessions. The inferior people indeed, who have nothing to lose, will be at all times for breaking down the fences, that they may have some share of the common plunder. I should mention one instance. Sup pose any of you had bought this estate of the late Ro gers, being advised by your lawyer that he had the power to sell it, (which he certainly had, as the law has declared he had a right of giving it away,) you would then think it very hard that the present Rogers, with his wicked crew, should come and take it away by force, and afterwards keep it as he now does. Suppose the money you paid him for it he gave to his widow ; should you in such a case agree that 'tis his brother's right to have the estate? Let every one make this his own case. I believe you all honest men, and wo'nt suspect any one of you of justifying this affair ; but I have put these arguments into your mouths to warn other people from this vicious way of thinking, and that you may exert yourselves in keeping this hardship from the parish, from which I could never learn this Rogers deserved so much kindness as to suffer on his account; for he never paid church, priest, or poor, when he was in possession of the estate, and withheld from many their just due. The character of the honest and just man is to relieve the poor, to pity the unfortunate; but to use their utmost endeavours to punish the guilty, and to recommend and enforce an obedience to the laws of the land, which are the only protection of our lives and properties.

The history of St. Cuthbert. \u2014 He was born in Cumber- land, of British Saxon parents, about the year 600 ; and had his Christian education as a monk in Bangor Monastery, in Ireland ; from whence he removed to the abbey of Lan- disfarne, opposite to Northumberland and North Durham, where, after he had remained some years, he was chosen' or made a bishop of that diocese. I remember to have seen in this church, painted against the wall, about thirty years past, the portraiture of a bishop, attired in his epis- copal robes, with mitre or crown on his head, a crosier or shepherd's crook or staff in his hand, and an inscription in ancient character near it, viz. St. Cnchbeptun. Which picture, I am told, is since covered over with lime by the churchwardens. D"], [332, "290 CUBERT. Now, it happened after the death of St. Cuthbert, that the island of Landisfarne was extremely troubled with the piratical thievish Danes, who wasted the same, without re gard of secular or religious persons and places. Where upon the Bishop of St. Ethelwin, with his monks, privately escaped into Northumberland, and left their houses and estates a prey to their enemies, anno Dom. 800, carrying with them as their chief treasure the enshrined relics or skeleton of St. Cuthbert, with which, during the lives of twelve titular bishops of Landisfarne, they wandered up and down Northumberland for the space of ninety years, without any fixed place of abode or settlement, till Ald wyn, titular bishop of that island, obtained leave of King Alfred, ann. Dom. 890, to pitch and settle his episcopal church at Durham, where he and his monks laid the foundation thereof; which, after it was by them finished, was consecrated and dedicated to the honour of Almighty God in the name of St. Cuthbert, where they again erected his shrine or relics; thereby transferring or translating tbe bishopric of Landisfarne to that place, and no more styling themselves bishops thereof, but of Durham. But this fabrick of Bishop Adelwyn, though a stately church, was pulled down by William Carilepho, the 29th bishop (13 Will. I. 1080), who in the place thereof laid the foundation of that cathedral church now extant there; though he did not live to see it finished ; but Ralph Flam bard, his successor, Lord Treasurer of England, went on with the work, and brought it to that perfection it now showeth; though some additions indeed were made by Ni cholas de Farnham, and Thomas Welscomb, prior thereof, 1242. King Alfred, and Guthrun the Dane, his deputy-go vernor of Northumberland, gave much lands to this church between the rivers Tees and Tyne, which King Alfred con firmed by his charter. In William the Conqueror's days it was reputed a county palatine or principality, and aid engrave upon its"], [333, "291 CUBERT. seal an armed chevalier, holding a naked sword in one hand, and in the other the arms of the bishopric, viz.

But the immunities of this church of Durham were shortened by the statute 27 Henry VIIL, and the lordly ab solute power of this bishopric conferred upon the king. Afterwards, temp. Edw. VI. the lands and whole title of the bishopric of Durham was by act of parliament con ferred upon that king, which act was repealed 1 Queen Mary, when the dissolved bishopric and the royalties of it were in a measure revived and restored as it now stands. In this parish is that famous and well-known spring of water called Holy-well (so named the inhabitants say, for that the virtues of this water was first discovered on Allhallows- day). The same stands in a dark cavern of the sea-cliff rocks, beneath full sea-mark on spring-tides ; from the top of which cavern falls down or distds continually drops of water, from the white, blue, red, and green veins of those rocks. And accordingly, in the place where those drops of waterfall, it swells to a lump of considerable bigness, and there petrifies to the hardness of ice, glass, or freestone, of the several colours aforesaid, according to the nature of those veins in the rock from whence it proceeds, and is of a hard brittle nature, apt to break like glass. The virtues of this water are very great. It is incredible what numbers in summer season frequent this place and waters from counties far distant. Chynowen, now Chynoweth, id est, New-house, was the voke-lands of a considerable manor, under which jurisdic- tion this parish was taxed, 20 Will.

It is the dwelling of John Davis, Gent, that married Lannar, alias Vincent ; his father Hoblyn, of Penhall ; his grand father. TONKIN. By the register of this parish (which is very ancient) it appears that in the year 1569 there was a great plague here, by which died, from the 20th of August to the 10th of November, seventy people, and it then abating, from the 25th of December to the 23d of February fifteen more; which is the more considerable, for that in the parish at present, in its flourishing condition, there are not above three hundred and fifty souls ; and so healthy is the place in general, that I have been assured by Mr. Bradford, the present Minister, there was not a single burial from the 12th of September, 1699, to the 18th of October, 1700, the year following. The Holy Well, if it may properly be so called, (it be ing nothing but a little water dropping out of the cliff un der Kelsey, in a small cove made by the sea, to be come at only when the tide is out,) has been much frequented of late, and several strange cures attributed to it.

He was the son to Solomon, Duke, King, or Earl of Cornwall, about the year 350 ; and being bred up a zealous Christian of the orthodox faith, and finding the churches of Britain much pestered with the heresy of the Arians, who denied the equality of the persons in the Trinity or Godhead, holding one to be before or superior to the other, Cuby not inclining to receive this new doctrine, especially having read some of the writings of St. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers in Gaul, in opposition thereto ; he made addresses to that worthy father in order to his better instruction ; by wbom he was kindly invited into Gaul, and went there accordingly. He was so charmed with the wisdom, piety, and holy doctrine of St. Hilary, that he became his disciple, and was by him ordained or consecrated priest, and took upon him the office of a preacher ; in which capacity he grew so famous for his preachings in that coun try, he was at length, by St. Hilary, sent missioner of the gospel into North Wales ; and he proved so successful there-"], [337, "295 ST. CUBYE, OR TREGONY. in, that the greatest part of the people were converted to the Christian faith, and the altars and images of Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Minerva, and other gods worshipped by the Britons and Romans there, were thrown down and de faced. Capgrave, who compiled his life, tells us that St. Cuby wrought miracles, gave sight to the blind, cleansed the leprous, caused the dumb to speak, cured the palsy, and those possessed of devils. Moreover, saith he, Cuby was in Ireland, where he preached the gospel, and built churches there before St. Patrick came into that country. And he further saith of him, that he was very studious of the peace of the church. And Bale tells us he was such a self-denying man that, after his father's death, he refused the dominion of Cornwall, his fortune, and wealth, out of a desire he had to acquire learning, and to preach the gospel. Leland tells us in his Itinerary Manuscripts, that St. Hilary made St. Cuby Bishop of the Isle of Anglesey ; that he died about the year of our Lord 400 ; after his death his disciples set up his shrine, that is, his bones, in his church there; and when the Irishmen of Dublin, a thousand years after, in June 1404, invaded the island and found this relic, they carried away the same, and set it up in the church ofthe Holy Trinity in Dublin. Nevertheless there are still extant in the Isle of Anglesey three nota ble monuments of him and his master, viz. Point Hilary, Holyhead, and Caer-Cuby, viz. Cuby's City or Castle. That Tregony Borough was invested with the privileges of a manor and court-leet, before the Norman Conquest, Domesday Roll informs us. How long before by pre scription, no man living can tell. King Henry I. (the Earl dom of Cornwall being then vested in the Crown) gave it the freedom of sending two burgesses, citizens, or towns men, to sit in Parliament as its representatives, to be chosen by the majority of the townsmen that were house keepers ; which favour was obtained upon the humble peti tion of Henry de Pomeroy, lord of this manor, temp, of the said Henry I. But this place was not incorporated but by"], [338, "296 ST. CUBYE, OR TREGONY. the charter of King James I. 1621 ; and consists of a mayor, recorder, and eight capital burgesses, the eldest of which is justice of the peace for life within the borough. It hath also a weekly market on Saturdays, and fairs yearly upon May 3, July 25, September 1, November 6, and Shrove Tuesday. The castle of Tregony, as tradition saith, was built by the said Pomeroy, on behalf of John Earl of Cornwall, in opposition to King Richard I. his elder brother, then beyond the seas in the Holy War. The chief inhabitants of this town are Mr. Tonkin, Mr. Penlyer, Mr. Peters, Mr. Earle. The arms of which bo rough are, a pine-apple, or pomegranate, on its stem, with two leaves. This Pomeroy was the descendant of Ralph de Pome roy, or Pomeraye, that came into England with William the Conqueror, and was such a friend and favourite of his, as Dugdale saith in his Baronage, that he conferred upon him fifty-eight lordships, whereof this Tregony and Wich (now Mary Wike) in Cornwall, were two ; perhaps such lands as fell to the Crown by virtue of their lord or owner's rebellion against the Conqueror in that insurrection at Exeter, in the second year of his reign. This Ralph de Pomeroy had issue Joel, that married one of the natural daughters of King Henry I. by Corbet's daughter (mother also by him of Reginald Fitz-Harry, Earl of Cornwall) ; the which Joel had issue by her Henry and Josceline. Henry married de Villie's daughter, and by her had issue Sir Henry de Pomeray, lord of this place, and Bury Po meroy in Devon, who sided with John Earl of Morton and Cornwall against Richard 1. then beyond the seas; and afterwards gave to the Knight Hospitallers of St. John the Baptist, the church of Maddarne in Penwith.

However the good undertaker was not discouraged at this misfortune, but re-edified the same the summer following; and so on for many summers after with greater skill, cost, and charges. But alas ! still the lofty current of the river Val, in winter season, was such a malicious and invincible enemy to this noble project, that, as before, it continually undermined the walls of those sluices for about the space of twenty years, so that the very worthy gentlemen aforesaid, in order ho- nestly to defray the charges of this work, hath spent the greatest part of this fine estate, and given over his under- taking as too difficult and unprofitable an enterprize.

The History of St. David. He was a Welsh Briton by birth, but of what place in Wales I know not, about the year 840 ; bred up in the Christian religion ; afterwards became learned in all the liberal arts and sciences ; was or dained priest, and by reason of his regular living and sanc tity of life, was constituted Presul or Bishop of Menevia, and held the Christian faith in great purity, opposite to the doctrines of Arius and Pelagius. Near this church is situate the barton of Davidstowe, formerly the lands of Pearse, Gent, whose daughter and heir carried it, together with herself, in marriage, to John Nicholls, Esq. whose son married Erisey, his grandson a daughter of Sir Joseph Tredinham, Knight, as his father did Pearse. Since which time the heir general of this family of Ni cholls is married to Glynn, of Glynn, Esq. TONKIN. That this parish was called Davidstow from St. David, the titular saint of the Welsh, I make no question; for I have never heard that the holy King David was ever en listed for the patron of a Christian church. I shall say no more of St. David, than that he was uncle to King Arthur, and therefore it is not wonderful that this church should be dedicated to him ; and that after he had attained the age of a hundred and forty-six years he died at his bishopric of Menevia, in Wales, since called from him St. David's, A. D. 642. EDITOR. St. David appears to have been a very extraordinary person, in reference to the period in which he lived. Gi raldus Cambrensis, in his Itinerarium Cambri\u00e6, published with annotations by David Powell, at London, 1585, 8vo. and by Sir Richard Hoare, in 2 vols. 4to. 1806, gives x"], [348, "306 DAVIDSTOWE. many particulars of St. David, his predecessor in the bishopric; and the praises bestowed by Giraldus on a founder of monasteries may be esteemed deserving of cre dit, as he was a professed and violent enemy to the monas tic orders. He is even said to have added to the Litany, \" A monachorum malitia libera nos, Domine,\" in an age when their power and influence were esteemed irresistible. St. David is said to have been the son of Xantus, Prince of Caretica, since named Cardiganshire. He was made a priest early in life, and then participating in the opinion universally prevalent, that the Deity would alone be pro pitiated by men rendering themselves useless to their fel low-creatures, by assuming almost the feelings and habits of brute beasts, and by adding, so far as they were able, to the misery and wretchedness of the human race, he betook himself to an ascetic life in the Isle of Wight, under the guidance of one Paulinus. But having at length acquired a sufficient stock of reputed sanctity by these efficacious means, he emerged like others from the desert, added to the establishments at Glastonbuiy, or as some say re founded the great work of St. Joseph of Arimathea, and tben created twelve monasteries in Wales. But St. David owes the largest share of his popularity to the active part which he took in the controversy at that time dividing the Western church ; one party maintaining that it had pleased Almighty God to bestow at once on his creatures, and from their births, the inclination and capa bility of serving him ; the other, that these gifts were re served for some future period, or dealt out from time to time, and bit by bit. The latter opinion having been voted to be the orthodox faith, was zealously supported by St. David against the former, known as the Pelagian heresy. He certainly lived to a very advanced age, and was buried in the cathedral at Menevia ; from whence, we have the testimony of St. Kentigern that his soul was visibly carried by angels into heaven. It is more certain that about the year 962 his relics were transported to Glaston-"], [349, "307 DAVIDSTOWE. bury, as this transaction is circumstantially related by John of Glastonbury, in his history of that splendid abbey, published by Hearne. St. David affords a remarkable instance, not merely of the fact that events are wrested to suit the taste or the pre judices of aftertimes, but of their being utterly inverted and transformed. When Eastern fictions became blended with the chivalry of Europe, this anchorite, polemic divine, and apostle of his native country, appeared as a military hero, expelling the Saxons from Wales, at the head of an army in which each individual was distinguished from their Pagan adver saries by affixing to his helmet the plant which has since been ever venerated by the Welch. And finally, Mr. Richard Johnson, a canon of Exeter, having adopted the mystical number seven for the Champions of Christendom, and bestowed the undue proportion of lour out of seven on these Islands, makes St. David, the champion of Wales, perform all the ordinary achievements of knight errantry, and adding, as was highly proper, a spirit of gallantry to that of valour, presents him as a lover eloping from Jeru salem with an Hebrew princess, who on her part had pre viously, by entreaties to her father, preserved the hero's life.

He was most elegant in the Attic tongue, as being the dialect of his native country, and consequently a good rhetorician. But that which made him more eminent was his skill in the doctrine of the Stoics, Epicureans, and other philosophers. Mr. Hals continues through several pages the history of St. Denis, but as the facts want altogether the support of historical authority, and do not include the most interest ing of all, that of his walking from Montmartre, where the sentence of decapitation was executed, to the place since denominated from him, with his head under his arm, I shall omit the whole ; as also an account of blood having fallen in this remote and sequestered churchyard, as the best and most authentic mode of apprising the whole nation that their fleet would be defeated by the Dutch, and that a plague would break out in London ; notwith standing that some of the stones, having blood upon them, were seen by the author himself.

History of St. Dominick, abridged from Hals : He was born at Calarvega in Spain, about the year 1167. His father was Don Felix de Gusman, his mother Donna Giovanna Deza, both well descended and faithful servants of God. Dominick early distinguished himself by his great ability, diligence, and proficiency in learning. He first studied at the University of Placentia, and from thence he was removed to Salamanca by Frederick the Second, King of Castille. He here obtained a reputation so far above all the other students as to induce Don Diego, Bishop of Osuna, to select him as the most proper person to become a canon in his church. Dominick was soon after appointed by Don Alonzo, King of Castile, to accompany his ambas- sador to the Court of France. On this journey the saint first encountered some of the Albigenses, and to the extinc- tion of their heresy he chiefly devoted the remainder of his life, by instituting his celebrated order of Dominican Preaching Friars A. D. 1215, in imitation of the Francis- cans, established about six years before. St. Dominick did not, however, implicitly rely on his own exertions, or on those of his order, suited as it was to the ignorance and abject slavery of those times ; but called loudly to their aid the secular arm, and established the Inquisition, so that after thousands had been converted from their heresy, and tens"], [354, "312 ST. DOMINICK. of thousands massacred, the conquerors enjoyed in the pos session of their plundered property the additional conscious satisfaction of having freed the church from heretics so audacious as to deny that wheaten * flour was entirely changed into the body of Christ. Dominick departed this life in the odour of sanctity on the 6th of August 1221, having completed his fifty-first year. Having performed various miracles, and even raised people from the dead, he was canonised by Gregory IX. in 1234. Before the close of his short life, a great number of houses were founded throughout Europe for his disciples, and, faithful to the original object of the new order, he be queathed to their charge the Tribunal of the Inquisition. The Dominicans and Franciscans for a long time sup ported the power of Rome, according to the dream of Pope Innocent III. in which he saw the Lateran Church in danger of falling down, and St. Dominick sustaining its weight. But finally, the sale of indulgences, through the medium of this order, excited the resentment or the envy of others, and Friar Martin Luther, assisted by the growing genius of the age, crumbled to pieces a spiritual authority, of which it was fondly believed that destiny had said with more truth than of its temporal predecessor, His ego nee metas rerum nee tempora pono; Imperium sine fine dedi.

By this name the now parish of St. Do minick, as aforesaid, was taxed in the Domesday Roll 20 William I. 1087, which place gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen, surnamed De Halton, who flourished here in gentle degree from the Norman Con quest to the ninth year of Edward the Second, at which time Joan, the only daughter and heir of Richard de Hal ton, Lord also of the Manor of Hardfast, in this county, was married to Robert Wendyn, of Compton Gifford, in Devon, who had issue by Joan de Halton, one only daugh ter, that became his heir, married to John Whiteleigh, of Efford, in Devon, father of Richard Whiteleigh, Sheriffof Devon 9 Richard II. grandfather of Richard Whiteleigh, Esq.

The 19 th of Elizabeth, Anthony Rous, Esq. then Sheriff of Cornwall, was possessed of this place ; as was also his son Anthony Rous, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall 44th Elizabeth. But Rous, Esq. the last possessor of this barton, dying without issue, as I take it, passed these lands to his widow for payment of debts, who afterwards married Cossens, and then sold it to her brother Henry Clerk, gent, that mar ried Sescomb, of St. Kevorne, now in possession thereof.

Trevisa also translated Bartholomew de Pro prietatibus Rerum, the Polychronicon of Ralph Higden, and divers other Treatises. He died a very aged man, about 1410, since which time the descendants of his family have flourished in good fame in those parts. Their arms are, Gules, a garb Or. Pentilly is the mansion of Sir James Tilly, Knt. for merly steward to Sir John Corington, who married first, a daughter of Sir Henry Vane, and was afterwards knighted by King James the Second. After this, having assumed the arms of Count Tilly, of Germany/together with his sup porters, he had them taken from him, and was fined by the kings at arms several hundreds for his presumption. This occurrence gave rise to an unfounded story of his having been degraded from his knighthood, for that he was not a gentleman either of blood, arms, or descent ; but it is clear that a knight need not be a gentleman of blood, witness the number at present that are got so. To his second wife he married the widow of Sir ifalin Corington, his former master ; she was one of the daughters of Sir Richard Chi verton, of London; but he did not leave any remaining issue by either of his wives. This Pentilly is a new name given by himself to this his seat, from its situation on the side of a steep hill, having a pleasant prospect of the river Tamar, and of the country round about. He has adorned it with fine new buildings, composed of several towers with gilded balls, and several walks of lime-trees on the side of the hill. All which together at a distance made a pretty show.

In Domesday Book it is called Haltone ; and it was one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to his bro ther Robert Earl of Morton, when he created him Earl of Cornwall.

I believe that St. Dominica must be sought for in the same Canon with St. Veronica and St. Kurie Eleeeson. Mr. Lysons says that Francis Rous, distinguished as a member of both houses during the Protectorate, was born at Halton about the year 1579. He was made provost of Eton College, and died at Acton, in Middlesex, in January 1659. The property now belongs to Mrs. Bluett, daugh ter and heiress of Mr. John Clerk, in whose family were this manor, and the advowson of the living, Mr. Lysons further states that Charles Fitz-Geoffry, rec tor of this parish, where he died in 1637, published the Life of Sir Francis Drake, written in lofty verse and when he was only Bachelor of Arts, a Collection of Latin Verses, &c. Sir James Tillie appears to have been at the least an eccentric man, from the fanciful directions which he gave respecting his funeral. He was succeeded, as has been stated, by his nephew, James Woolley, who took his name; and the only daughter of this gentleman's grandson married the late Mr. John Coryton, of Crockadon, de scended by a female line from the Corytons of Newton.

But maugre all designs and endea vours of Mr. Fincher to purchase the patronage of this church, Sir John Seynt-aubyn and Mr. Arundell, the pa trons thereof, sold the same to Balliol College in Oxford 1701. At the consideration of which fact, as common fame saith, Mr. Fincher was so dismayed, that forthwith he grew melancholy, and the grief thereof so depressed his spirits, that he broke his heart, and departed this life 26th November 1703, at night; and so went to Heaven in that great tempest and hurricane that then happened, with many others. The vicar has now all the tithes, paying 40/. yearly to the master or one of the fellows of Balliol College, by act of parliament. Properly he is the rector of a church, that hath a parsonage where a vicarage is endowed, to which he presents, as in this parish ; and yet it is supposed, in some places, that person is the patron, or he in whom the right of patronage is ; for before the second Council of Lateran, A.D. 1131, he had right to the tithes, in regard of his having endowed the church which he had founded. But the Council of Lateran aforesaid, under Pope Innocent II. consisting of two thousand bishops, made it sacrilege and damnation for laymen to take tithes. Tre-wer-gy, id est, the village or farm-town, the same, I suppose, in Domesday Roll, taxed by the name of Tre worgan, being still the voke lands of an ancient barton and manor, which claims the royalty or liberty of fishing over the river and haven of Loo, by virtue of the grant thereof from the ancient Earls and Dukes of Cornwall in right of their honour, manor, borough, and castle of Liskeard, si tuate upon the same river, which place was the mansion of the ancient, worshipful, and gentle family of the Ken dalls for many ages ; and in particular here lived Richard de Kendall, Sheriff of Cornwall 8 Richard II. 1385, as his posterity continued to do till John Kendall, Esq. having no issue temp.

The arms of Kendall are, Argent, a chevron between three dol phins Sable. Ken-dall signifies to see or behold the dale or valley ; otherwise Kendall or Cendall is fine linen ; and Cen-dale may be a corruption of Pendall, id est, the head of the valley. Tremada in this parish signifies the extasy or transport town, alias Tremodart, that is, the dart or javelin affliction (as Cornish -English for hobel is a dart). This barton and manor, as I am informed, was the dwelling of the Col-shills, id est, neck-shields ; so called from their wearing, in time of battle, their shield or coat armour with a ribbon about their neck, originally denominated from Colshill parish, in Arden hundred, in Warwickshire. And in particular here lived John Collshill, sheriff of Cornwall 16 Rich.

The lords of this manor and barton of Tremadah, I suppose, founded and endowed the vicarage and rectory church of Dulo.

West-north, or rather north-west, is the voke-lands of a dismembered manor, formerly belonging to the Kendalls of Treworgye, and was by one of them, temp.

In respect to the name of this parish, I cannot agree with Mr. Hals in supposing it God's Lake. I rather interpret it the Black Lake, alluding to the river Looe, which runs through it, and I guess takes that name from its forming a deep lake or pool between the two towns and it when the tide is in."], [363, "321 DULO. THE EDITOR. The etymology of Dulo given by Mr. Tonkin appears to be very probable ; but another is quoted by Mr. Bond, in his excellent work, entitled, \" Topographical and Histori cal Sketches of the Boroughs of East and West Looe, in Cornwall,\" printed by Nichols in 1823, p. 48 : \"In Archbishop Usher's work, Britannicarum Ecclesia rum Antiquitates et Primordia, it appears that the church of St. Theliaus, in Wales, is called, Lhan Deilo Vaur, the Church of Great Theliaus; and the change of Deilo to Dulo is so easy, says a recent writer, that St. Theliaus seems to have the best title to this parish, as patron and owner of it. In confirmation of this conjecture, says the same writer, we find in the barton of Treridern in St. Burian a chapel dedicated to St. Dillo, who is indisputably the Theliaus.\" St. Theliau, or Theliauses, was born at Ecclesis Gwenwau, near Monmouth. He is said to have made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem about the year 500, with St. David and St. Paternus. On his return he became Bishop of Landaff, and he has ever since been considered as the patron of that diocese. Trewargy, properly Tre-war-gie, the house or town on a stream, is now the property of Mr. Eliot, a gentleman resident in London. Trenant has frequently changed its proprietors since the time of Mr. Hals. It passed from Mr. Dennis to his sister's son, Sir Christopher Treise, who was Sheriff of Cornwall at the accession of King George the Third, and knighted on the occasion of presenting an address. The property thus devolved on his nephew Sir John Morshead, of Cartuther, who acquired a large fortune by his marriage, succeeded to an ample patrimony, dissipated the whole, and and left the prefix of three letters as an inheritance to his son. It was then purchased by Admiral Sir Edward Buller, and again disposed of after his decease to Mr. Hope, who at this instant, 1833, offers it for sale.

But that which made this place most famous was the castle and palace of Dundagell, wherein in all probability, the Kings, Dukes, or Earls of Cornwall, at some time had their residence, for pleasure and safety, before C\u00e6sar came into this land ; and for that it was the birthplace of Arthur y 2"], [366, "324 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. King of Britain, of whom more under. The castle itself stood on the sea cliff, and a high promontory of land or island, shooting into the North Sea or St. George's Chan- nel, fastened to the main land or insular continent of Bri- tain, by an iron chain and drawbridge, which Mr. Carew saith was extant about 100 years before he wrote his Survey of Cornwall 1602. Hence it was that in the Domesday Tax, 20 William I. 1087, it is called Dunecheine, as afore- said, viz. the fort, fortress, or castle chain or chained. Under which drawbridge the sea formerly did daily make its flux and reflux, through the rocky passage beneath. But now this passage is barred up by the falling down of the contiguous cliffs, and want of repair ; nevertheless, thereby at low water is offered to the foot traveller an indif ferent way of access to the castle or island aforesaid. Which island is now by lease from the crown in possession of Mr. Travers, who sets it to rent for about 5/. per annum, where twice a year about thirty fat sheep are bred or fed, that thrive to admiration. The back or outer part of this fort or island, contains about three acres of land, which affords . good pasture for sheep, goats, and rabbits, whereon is a consecrated well, and chapel heretofore applied to the service of God, by the Prince Gothlouis, his domestic servants and soldiers, though now neglected and falling into continual decay. The most northerly and remote part of this island is called Pen-dew, or Pen-diu, that is to say black head, so named from the black cliff's and rocks thereof; a well known sea mark, amongst mariners. The cliffs all round this island and decayed castle are from the sea inaccessible, excepting in one place on the east, where is an indifferent landing place for boats ; but the same is artificially barred with a long lofty and strong wall of lime and stone, through which was a gate, called in British, Porth Home, Anglice Iron Gate, leading to the hill.

Est locus Abrini sinuoso littore ponti, Rupe situs media, refluus quem circuit \u00e6stus Fulminat hie late turrito vertice, castrum, Nomine Tindaglum veteres dixere Corini. Thus Englished by Mr. Carew, p. 286, Lord Dunstan ville's edition : There is a place within the winding shore of Severne sea, On midst of rock, about whose foot the tides turnkeeping, play ; A towry topped castle here, which blazeth over all, Which Corineus' ancient brood Tiudagell Castle call. However, I think, the meaning of the author is rather thus in English prose : \" There is a place in the intricate windings of the Severn sea, situate in the middle of a rock, which the waves or billows of the sea compass or flow about, a towering top of a castle, shining or blazing abroad far and near, which the old or ancient Cornish call Dundagell.\" Of this place Joseph of Exeter, a priest of that Cathe dral, that went with King Richard I. into the Holy Land, and described the wars thereof, in his poem called Anti ochesis, written at Antioch 500 years past ; a person excel lently skilled in the Greek and Latin tongues (who after his return from the Holy Land, was made Archbishop of Bourdeaux (see Hooker and Isaac), hath these words (thus Englished) of Dundagell.

So would our Arthur in contest o'ercome The mightiest heroes bred in Greece and Rome. The only prince that hears this just applause, Greatest that e'er shall be, and best that ever was. From which words it is evident Joseph had seen Merlin's prophecy of King Arthur. The History of King Arthur and his progenitors is this : After the death of Ambrosius Aurelius, anno Dom. 497, succeeded to the dominion of Britain, some say his brother, others a Britain named Uter, alias Uter Pen-dragon ; that is to say in British the terrible or dreadful head or chief dragon, so called, as our historians tells us, from a direful, bloody, or red dragon, pourtrayed in his banners of war with a golden head, as is to this day borne in our imperial standards of war, in memory doubtless of the red dragon mentioned in Merlin's Prophecy, by which the British na tion is figured. For his paternal coat armour, as Upton saith, was, in a field Vert, a plain cross Argent ; in the dexter quarter the image of the blessed Virgin Mary, hold ing the image of her blessed Son in her right hand, Proper. He likewise gave for his cognizance of Britain, d'Or, deux dragons Verd, corones de Goules, contreles, or endorsed. Which prince, about the fourth year of his reign, having had divers notable victories over his enemies the Saxons, killing Pascentrus, the son of Hengist, and Gwellimoore King of Ireland, taken Octa and another son of Hengist, and Cossa, his nephew, prisoners, and routed their forces ; he resolved the Easter after to make a kind of triumphal feast and solemnity for the principal nobility, gentry, and soldiers, of his kingdom ; and ordered likewise that their wives and daughters should also be invited to his court, to congratulate his victories against his Pagan enemies. Now this feast was to be kept at Caer-Segont, id est, the city or castle of conquest or victory, afterwards called, by the Saxons, Cell-Cester, id est, Great Castle, now Winn- Chester, as much as to say, the overcoming, conquering, or winning castle, as before ; the very place where the Em-"], [369, "327 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEI peror Constantine first put on the purple robes, in order to his dignity. Amongst other princes and confederates that attended this solemnity, Goth-lois, or Goth-Louis, id est, purple back or spear, Prince, King, or Earl of Cornwall, with Igerna, his lady, graced the same with their presence. And it was observable that in this great assembly, the said lady, for beauty, port, and mein, exceeded all other women then present. With whose unparalleled demeanour and charms, King Uter was so much taken and delighted, or intoxicated rather, that for several days he omitted all other most necessary affairs of his kingdom, in order to enjoy her company. Yea, so violent was his affection, that he could not restain or curb his passion, but kissed and courted her openly, even in the sight of her lord and others. Where- upon Gothlouis^was so possessed with jealousy that he took the first opportunity, without leave taken ofthe king or his nobility, together with his duchess and servants, and posted from Winchester, towards his own country of Devon and Cornwall. He had not been long gone, but the notice thereof was soon brought to the king, who took it in so ill apart, by reason of his inordinate affection to his lady, that forthwith he sent messengers after him, to let him know that he had further occasion to use his counsel about affairs ofthe nation. But Gothlouis so highly prized his lady, who by this ar- tifice he foresaw would be exposed to the king's attempts, that he sent back positive answer that he would not come. At which return the king grew more enraged, and sent the Prince of Cornwall word, that if he persisted in his obsti- nacy, he would invade his country, and beat his towns and castles about his ears ; but in vain were his menaces, for Gothlouis returned him word that he was, as his predeces sors time out of mind had been, a free prince, and owed him neither homage nor allegiance. Nevertheless, as his countryman, he acknowledged himself his ally and confe derate against all foreign opposers, and would keep his"], [370, "328 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. articles of agreement ; but if Uter were not contented with this answer, but would forcibly invade his country and pro perty, he would endeavour to keep and preserve the same against him and his adherents. Whereupon King Uter denounced hostility against him, and sent him defiance as an enemy, and forthwith set all things in a posture of war against him. Neither was Gothlouis less solicitous to keep his country and duchess from Uter's possession or indeed vile usurpation. In brief, therefore, as aforesaid, King Uter having raised a great army of soldiers, under pretence of chastising the pride and contempt of Gothlouis, marched with them to wards his territories, which extended as far as Axminster, where he no sooner arrived than he falls a plundering the country, and burning the houses of the inhabitants, with the terror whereof some fled away, and others submitted to his mercy. Gothlouis being then at his chief palace and castle of Caer-Iske, id est, the Fish Castle or City, situate upon the Fish River, now called Exe, as the City is Exeter, and hearing of this affrightment and revolt of the people on the east part of his dominions, and fearing the cowardice of his citizens of Caer-Iske, he quitted the same upon Uter's approach with his army, and fled from thence with his lady, and posted themselves in this castle of Dundagell, where he left his duchess, himself retiring to Dameliock Castle, now in St. Veye or St. Vewe, where his army lay entrenched within a treble walled fortification of earth, still extant, and retaining its name, wherein he had laid up sufficient provi sion and ammunition for his camp and soldiers, &c. And there also he was promised to receive assistance of soldiers from one of the five Kings of Ireland, which were daily expected. King Uter understanding of Gothlouis' departure from Caer-Iske, soon marched after him with his army into Cornwall, and laid siege to the castle of Dameliock, that is to say, the house or place of skirmish, battle, or hazard of war, and no sooner approached the lines, but he sent an"], [371, "329 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. herald or trumpet to Gothlouis, demanding the surrender of himself and castle on mercy. Gothlouis, rewarding the trumpet, returned answer, \" that he gave King Uter no just cause of war, or for breaking the league or invading his country, and wasting the same in such barbarous man ner. But especially, he being a free prince, neither could nor would betray his trust, or give up his dominions and subjects to an unjust invader.\" At which answer King Uter was so enraged, that he gave order for a straight siege of the castle, and forthwith made many violent assaults by storm in several places thereof; but he was as stoutly re pulsed and driven back by the besieged. In this manner, with various success, for many days the siege and war con tinued, which occasioned the many camps, fortifications, and intrenchments in those parts, called Castle Kitty, Biny, Castle Kynven, &c. Whereupon King Uter being more desirous to obtain the Lady Igerna, than to shed blood, or take the fort of Dameliock, thought of nothing more than how to get pos session of her. In order to which, he was so vain as to in quire whether the said lady was within the said castle, and whether she was in so good state of health as when he saw her at Caersegant. To which questions answer was made, that fame reported nothing to the contrary as to her health, but for her person, that was not in Dameliock Castle, but kept in a much more secure place, within the impreg nable fort of Dundagell. Then, inquiring further of a de serter what manner of place that was, he was told it was a casde munified by art and nature, and of so narrow entrance over the sea and rocks by a drawbridge, that three armed men at once would keep out his whole army, maugre all their skill and strength. At the relation of which circum stances, King Uter seemed mightily dismayed, so that his countenance changed through anguish and perplexity of mind, which put him into such great anxiety as was Ahab for want of Naboth's vineyard, David for Bathsheba, and Nero for Sabina Popeia, other men's wives."], [372, "330 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. King Uter Pendragon, in this extremity, as not being able to reduce Dameliock Castle by storm, nor, if he could, would that redress his grief, by procuring the sight of Igerna, resolves upon this expedient, to dislodge part of his soldiers and troops from Dameliock, and march with them to Dundagell, in order to try the fortune of war in both places. But as soon as he came in sight thereof, the same appeared more formidable, tremendous, and invincible, than what report or fame had spoken of it. For in those days the wit and force of man, could not oblige that castle to a surrender, unless through bribery or treachery of its defendants, for that the same could neither be scaled, bat- tered, or starved. The consideration of which put Pendragon into greater sadness and perplexity of mind, through the charge and fa- tigues of war, the stain of his honour in these unsuccessful attempts, but chiefly for that he could not obtain the fair Igerna ; whereupon he grew sickly and took his bed, his physicians despairing of his life. When it happened, as historians tell us, that one Ursan, of Richardock, a place near Dameliock or Dundagall, one of King Uter's cabinet council, advised him to send into Wales, for the old British prophet Merlin, and try whether he could do that by his magic art which neither the art or courage of men of war could effect ; whereupon Pendragon sent for the prophet, who when arrived to his camp was made acquainted with the premises, and immediately bid the king to be of good comfort, for that he doubted not but in short time he would introduce him to the company of Igerna, without further bloodshed or hostility. The king gladly heard this discourse, and promised to follow any expedient he should prescribe, in order to ob tain the lady ; and further assured him of a great reward, in case his project succeeded. Whereupon Merlin ordered the king, together with Ursan, of Richardock, to attend him one night in the twilight, with whom in secret manner he went towards the drawbridge gate of Dundagell Castle,"], [373, "331 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. where, making a noise, the sentinel or porter demanded in the dark who they were? Merlin being transformed into the shape of Bricot, a servant that waited on Gothlouis, and lay in his chamber, made answer that his master, Duke Gothlouis, escaped from the siege of Dameliock, was at the gate for entrance. The porter apprehending he heard the very voice of Bricot, and seeing at some distance two per sons talking together, the one King Uter metamorphosed into the shape of Duke Gothlouis, and another, viz. Ursan, of Richardock, transformed into the shape of Jordan, of Dundagell, he let down the drawbridge, and so gave them opportunity to enter into the insular castle aforesaid, where he had further confirmation of the identity or reality of their persons, by their speech and apparel, as far as the night would permit him. Whereupon he forthwith joyfully conducted King Uter to Igerna 's chamber, who, not discovering the fraud, gladly received him as her lord ; when that very night was be gotten that valiant, noble, and religious Prince Arthur, who for his brave, facinourous, and heroic achievements, made his name glorious in his days, as it is still the paragon of ours. Now on that same night his soldiers were so careful and valiant in the siege of Dameliock Castle, that they stormed it with their scaling ladders, but were as stoutly driven back by the besieged ; whereupon, Duke Gothlouis resolved no longer to be thus cooped up, or confined in walls or trenches, but either to conquer or die, and the next morning sallied forth with a party of soldiers, and assaulted his ene mies in their quarters by surprize : but alas ! the success was not answerable to his courage and resolution, for King Liter's men were all in readiness to receive his charge and onset, so that in the brunt of the first encounter Gothlouis was killed on the spot, his party slain or routed, and all that were taken in arms put to the sword. The castle of Dame liock yielded on condition of life, though some say otherwise, the plunder to the king's soldiers."], [374, "332 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. Early on the same morning, before King Uter and the duchess were out of their chamber, or had on their wearing apparel, to the great astonishment of the porter, centinel, and the garrison, a messenger arrived at Dunda gell Castle, giving a full account of the tragical fact. But when he was admitted to the Duchess's bedchamber, and saw, as he verily believed, Duke Gothlouis in her company, he could hardly credit his own report; especially the Duchess Igerna being of the same opinion. But then, alas ! so unavoidable a thing is fortune or fate, the prophet Merlin began to uncharm and dissolve his former spells and incantations, so that King Uter appeared no longer as Gothlouis Duke of Cornwall, but sole monarch of Britain ; his companion, not Jordan of Dundagell, but Ursan of Richardock ; and the third, not Bricot, but Merlin the pro phet, to the great admiration of all spectators. Whereupon the king took leave of the Duchess, and posted to his army, then in possession of Dameliock Castle, and ordered search to be made for the dead body of the duke ; where at length it was found in common soldier's ap parel, extreme bloody, mangled, and cut. Whereupon he called an embalmer, who forthwith embalmed the body with salt and aromatic spices, to prevent putrefaction till a mili tary interment could be prepared for him, which a month after was splendidly provided, the King and Duchess being chief mourners ; when, a few days after, King Uter publicly married Igerna the duchess, by whom as aforesaid he had a son named Arthur and a daughter named Amye. Lastly, it is observed by our annalists upon the foregoing history, that after this bloody war, and unjust fact of King Uter's, he never had any tolerable success against his Saxon enemies ; but in many battles was worsted by them, and finally, some of them understanding of a good spring or well of water, whereof he usually drank, they secretly enve nomed the same, so that afterwards the king, drinking his customary draught thereof, soon after, with intolerable pains, died in the fifteenth year of his reign, and the flower of his"], [375, "DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. 333 age, anno Dom. 515, fulfilling that saying in the Sacred Writings, \" The same measure that ye mete shall be mea sured to you again, brimfull and running over.\" So that I shall conclude this history in the words of St. Paul, \" O the height of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out !\" After the death of King Uter Pendragon, his son and heir Arthur, begotten as aforesaid, succeeded to his domi nion of Britain, anno Dom. 515, but as others say 518. He is therefore rightly named by some authors, Arthur Mab Uter Pendragon, viz. Arthur, the son of Uter Pendragon. Which name Arthur is probably derived from the British Arthou, a good or sharp pointed weapon. Of this King Arthur, long before his birth, had Merlin prophecied to King Vortigern : \" Aper etenim Cornubi\u00e6 succursum pr\u00e6stabit [si non potius erit] et colla eorum sub pedibus suis conculcabit, insul\u00e6 oceani potestati ipsius subdentur ; et Galicanos saltus possidebit: tremebit Romulea Domus sevitiam ip sius ; et exitus ejus dubius erit; in ore populorum c\u0153lebra bitur, et actus ejus cibus erit narrantibus. Sex posteri ejus tenebunt sceptrum,\" &c. Which in English amounts to this : \" That the boar of Cornwall shall bring aid and assist ance, and shall tread the necks of our enemies under his feet, the islands of the ocean shall be subject to his power, and the Gaulish forests he shall possess, the house of Ro mulus shall tremble at his wrath. As for his death or end, it shall be doubtful or uncertain. His name shall be cele brated by the people, and his famous acts shall be food to those that do relate them. Six of his lineage shall sway the sceptre,\" &c. King Arthur no sooner succeeded to his father's domi nions but he applied himself with great piety and religion to administer law and justice to his people, the best expe dients to establish a tottering sceptre. In the next place"], [376, "334 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. he took care to fortify and strengthen himself with soldiers and arms against his Saxon enemies, a mighty and warlike people, then possessed of the greatest part of this kingdom by the late misfortunes of his father and other princes, in battle with them, so that only Wiltshire, Devon, Dorset, Cornwall, and Wales, made up his dominion. Against these King Arthur drew into the field a mighty army of soldiers, and after eleven pitched battles against them, over threw their whole armies, and obtained the total dominion of this kingdom, and confined the Saxons, on condition of tribute and submission, only to the kingdom of Kent. And recorded it is by annalists, that in one of those battles which King Arthur had with them, he girded himself with an ap proved sword, called Callib-burne, with which in one day he slew with his own hands 800 Saxons. It seems, this weapon was like Goliah's sword wrapped in the ephod, there was no sword like it. And thus, according to Mer lin's prophecy, did the boar of Cornwall bring help and assistance, and tread Britain's enemies under his feet. But no sooner was this land settled in peace at home, but plots and designs from abroad were laid to disturb the tran quillity thereof. For at that time the Romans, having made a peace with their enemies the Vandals, sent mes sengers to King Arthur, demanding 3,000/. per annum tribute, a prodigious sum in those days, many years in arrear, according to the agreement Julius C\u00e6sar made with King Cassibellan, and was still due to the senate. At which demand King Arthur was so distasted, that he sent away the messengers in scorn, and prohibited any Romans ever after to come into this land upon that account. Especially for that the Romans for many years had voluntarily quitted or forsaken the government thereof, so that the Britains had neither their protection nor aid against their Saxon or other enemies. When these messengers returned to Rome, this contempt of King Arthur was resented by the Senate, who thereupon unanimously voted a war against him. And accordingly a great army was raised in order to conquer"], [377, "335 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. and reduce this land, which arrived here under conduct of Lucius, their prince or emperor, as historians tell us, to gether with ten kings, his confederates and auxiliaries. Against these king Arthur advanced with a mighty host, and gave them battle, where, after a sharp and bloody con flict, the Roman Emperor Lucius was slain, his body after wards sent to Rome, the whole Roman army routed, and the greatest part of them put to the sword, and those whose lives he spared he made his feodors and vassals. But, alas ! notwithstanding King Arthur's good fortune in this island against the Romans, he was not contented therewith, but he resolved to be further revenged upon them for his wrongs, bloodshed, and indignity, and for pre vention of any such invasion for the future, to make a de scent with his army upon the Roman territories in Gaul, especially for that from thence the Romans were assisted with great numbers of soldiers, under Lucius, to invade his kingdom of Britain. Whereupon King Arthur, with a considerable fleet of ships, and a great army of soldiers, landed in Normandy, then called Neustria, and summoned the people either to come and submit to his sceptre, or give him battle. But they, confiding in the strength of the Ro man legions in that country, slighted his offer, and gave him battle, in which contest they were totally overthrown, routed, or slain. So that, soon after the province of Nor mandy submitted to his mercy, cast down armour, and payed tribute. Whereupon he gave to Gaius his taster, the earldom of Andegavia, now Angieurs ; and to Bedeverus, his cupbearer, the dukedom of Normandy, for their good services. In memory of which donations, it grew to a cus tom amongst the kings of France, for many ages after, to make their tasters and cupbearers Earls of Andegavia and Normandy. After this victory King Arthur dislodged his forces, and advanced further into the Roman Gaulish provinces, and subdued by conquest to his sceptre Flanders, Burgundy, Aquitain, and Andegavia, and as some tell us afterwards"], [378, "336 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. Poland, and obliged those people to pay him an annual tribute according ; as Merlin had predicted of him, that the Gaulish forests he should possess, and that the house of Ro mulus should tremble at his wrath. After those victories he returned safe into Britain, and then also by his fleet and army reduced to his dominion, Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, Gothland, Norway, Dacia, and made them all tributary, which also was foretold by Merlin in those words, \" the islands of the ocean shall be subject to his power.\" When, after he had established peace in all those lands, and returned into Britain, he instituted an honourable order of knighthood, called the Knights of the Round Table, the most antient order of knighthood in the world, chiefly to promote self-denial, and prevent differences amongst his nobility and gentry or soldiers, who had well deserved of him and his country, for their good services at home and abroad, that so no occasion of dispute might arise about pre cedence, in merit, antiquity, valour, wealth, honour, or no bility, amongst them, for that all the knights of this his order were alike equal in those respects in his esteem, and might sit down indifferently at the table, go in and out of the house or church, field, or market, before each other as they came without exception ; being an allowed rule amongst them, that the highest seat at the court, senate, church, or table, did no more argue the worth, value, religion, valour, or prudent conduct of a man, than the precedence of a mi litary officer did prove him more valiant than his soldiers. The place of meetings of those knights was at Winchester aforesaid, where they assembled yearly at Pentecost or Whitsuntide. He gave the same religious Christian coat armour as was given by his father, which I have blazoned before ; and in testimony of his thirteen victories over so many crowned heads, he bore also in a field Azure, thirteen imperial crowns Or, as Upton tells us. Lastly, after this prince had thus vanquished his enemies abroad and at home, had restored the Christian Religion,"], [379, "337 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. eclipsed by the Saxons, ordained this useful order of knight hood, and done all the good offices a just, pious, and reli gious king could do to his subjects, he was at last, as many others, ungratefully dealt with by his own people, who at the instigation of his discontented cousin Mordred on the Roman Pictish title, confederated with the Saxons as against a bastard, and rose a great army in Cornwall in op position to his power: against whom King Arthur marched with his army, and gave them battle at a place near Camel ford. Where, though he obtained the victory, and Mor dred was slain, yet in that battle King Arthur received his mortal wounds, so that, soon after, in order to a cure, he retired to the vale of Avallan, id est, the apple valley, near Glastonbury, Somerset, where he lies buried. King Arthur's usual place of residence, where he kept his court (as Hennius the Briton tells us, who flourished anno Dom. 600), was at East or West Camellot, near Cad bury, in Wiltshire. There was extant in the Welsh tongue in bard's verses 1170, temp. Hen. II. a song which said that the body of King Arthur was buried at the Isle of Avallan, near Glas- tonbury, between two pyramids. Whereupon King Henry ordered search to be made after his corpse, as that most classical and authentic author Giraldus Cambrensis, who was an eye witness thereof saith, who relates, that after the pioneers had sunk about seven foot deep, they lighted upon a stone in form of a cross, to the back part thereof was fas tened a rude leaden cross, something broad, with those let ters inscribed : \" Hie jacet sepultus inclitus Rex Arturius in Insula Avalonia.\" Two feet beneath this cross they then also found two coffins made cf hollow oak, wherein were the bones and skeletons of King Arthur and of Genevour his wife, the hair of the said lady being then whole and of fresh colour, as Fabian saith, but as soon as touched it fell to powder.

King Arthur's three admirals at sea, as appears from the book of Thriades in British, were Gerint ab Erbyn, a no bleman of Cornwall, for then Cornwall and Devon were one county or province, slain at Lhongporth, now London, by the Saxons, anno Dom. 540 ; March ab Meircyon, and Gwenwynwyn ab Nau. There is yet extant in the British tongue an elegy upon the death of this Gerint,- which amongst others contains those words. Ray Rhytharmaur mab Erbin.

In Longporth was slain Gerint, A man beloved of Devon, Overcome in fight or vanquished In Longporth where he was slain for Arthur, A man beloved, that commanded over the water, Admiral or General of a fleet great. King Arthur also, by reason of the great schism in the Church between the Arian and Catholic Clergy, instituted the order of Knights of the Holy Trinity, and built the Chapel of Trinity at Restormell. Pierce Gaveston being made Earl of Cornwall by King Edward II. and afterwards banished for his wicked prac tices, and put to death by licence of that king, took out of the jewel house a table of gold, and tressells of the same, that once belonged to King Arthur, and delivered them to Amery of Friscoband, a merchant, to be carried into Gas coigne, where they were sold at a great price to his own private advantage, as our chronologers tell us."], [381, "DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. 339 But in memory of King Arthur, Roger Mortimer soon after, at such time as he and Queen Eleanor his concubine, wife of Edward the Second, governed this kingdom, in imita tion of him, kept a round table, to which many noble knights belonged and frequented, to his infinite cost and expense, which by him were called the Knights of the Round Table. (Heywood's Chronicles, p. 193.) The Isle of Man being conquered by William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, temp. Edward III. he caused him to be styled King of Man, and gave him leave to institute at Windsor, in a chamber two hundred feet round, in imita tion of King Arthur, a society of Knights of the Round Table. (Daniell's Chronicle, p. 196.) TONKIN. I shall offer a conjecture touching the name of this place, which I will not say is right but only probable. Tin is the same as Din, Dinas ; and Dixeth, deceit ; so that Tindixeth turned for the easier pronunciation to Tintagel , Dindagel, or Daundagel, signifies the Castle of Deceit, which name might be aptly given to it from the famous de ceit practised here by Uter Pendragon, by the help of Merlin's enchantment. The manor of Tintagel was very antiently demesne land of the crown, and famous for its castle, and Browne Willis says, the castle, manor, and borough of Tintagel, were settled by Edward the Third on his son Prince Edward, whom he created Duke of Cornwall, and continued it to his heirs, the succeeding Dukes of Cornwall, before which this king's brother, John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, held it. This castle boasts much greater antiquity, and is said to have been the seat of the Dukes of Cornwall, and pretends to have been the birthplace of the famousujfing Arthur, which happened above five hundred years before the Nor man Conquest, that prince having been born in the year 500, fifteen years after which he is said to have succeeded z 2"], [382, "340 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. bis father in the kingdom, and to have lost his life in the thirty-sixth year of his reign in a place near Camelford. The borough of Bossiney, known in this county by the name of Tintagel, is a very small village, and contains scarcely twenty houses, and those not better than cottages. This place, with Trevenna, another little hamlet equally mean, lie in the parish of Tintagel, from which church they are \u2022 at no great distance, and with it make up the one borough. It was privileged by Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, who granted \" Quod Burgus noster de Tyntaivil sit liber Burgus.\" It is governed by a mayor. The first return of Members to serve in Parliament is in the reign of Edward the Sixth. In an indenture during the reign of Queen Mary it is styled Trevenna alias Bossiney, in others Trevenna simply, in others Bossiney alone. The borough is held from the duchy at a fee-farm rent of 11/. 16s. 9{d. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons says, \" this castle, which is of great anti quity, is reported to have been the birthplace of King Ar thur, with respect to whom it was the opinion of Lord Chancellor Bacon, \" that there was truth enough in his story to make him famous, besides that which was fabulous.\" His history nevertheless has been so blended with the mar vellous by the monkish historians, that some authors have been disposed to doubt of his existence ; and the circum stances connected with his supposed birdi at Tintagel, are clearly not among those parts of his story most entitled to credit. We find no mention of this castle in authentic his- tory till the year 1245, when Richard Earl of Cornwall was accused of having offered an asylum at his castle of Tin- tagel, to his nephew David Prince of Wales, in rebellion against his uncle Henry the Third. Thomas de la Hyde was governor or constable of the castle in 1307, Tho-"], [383, "DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. 341 mas le Arcedekne in 1313, and William de Botreaux in 1325. It appears by a survey taken about that time, that the castle was in a very ruinous state. The great hall was taken down by John of Eltham. John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, was made constable in 1388.\" Mr. Carew states, p. 286 Lord Dunstanville's Edition, \"that being turned from a palace to a prison, this castle restrained one John Northampton's liberty, who for abusing the same in his unruly mayoralty of London, was condemned hither as a perpetual penitentiary,\" and Thomas Earl of Warwick was also a prisoner there in 1397. Lord Treasurer Burleigh abolished the office of constable or governor of this castle. Norden has a print, accompanied by a description of the castle, as it remained in his time, about 1584, when consi derable portions of the fortress appear to have remained both on the island and on the main land. The living belonged to the Great Benedictine Monastery at Fontevrault in Anjou, distinguished by the peculiarity of being presided over by an abbess, although the establish ment consisted of monks as well as nuns. Having been seized into the king's hands with other benefices belonging o & ry to alien houses, this parish was given by Edward the Fourth to the collegiate church of Windsor, where the great tithes and the patronage of the living still remain. It is stated by Doctor Borlase, that besides the chapel ivithin the fortress, dedicated to St. Ulette or Uliane, two others existed in the parish, one dedicated to St. Tiron and the other to St. Dennis. I have retained the fabulous history of the Great Arthur., with feelings similar to those which induced the Greeks to dwell on the twelve labours of their Hercules, or the Scan dinavians to recount the exploits of Odin. In a manner similar to what took place with respect to them, there exist reasons for conjecturing, at least that a mythological personage of remote antiquity became blended with a"], [384, "342 DUNDAGELL, OR TINTAGEL. British warrior who opposed the Saxons, and that the con stellation Arcturus is in this way connected with the Cornish chief. The tales translated from the Celtic by Jeffery of Mon mouth, Bishop of St. Asaph in 1152, are followed by the author from whom Mr. Hals collected his materials ; they are also copied into the romance of Prince Arthur, where in Caxton's edition is a print of the king sitting in the middle of his round table, with the knights companions sur rounding its circle. And this print has evidently given ori gin to the lines of our most facetious poet, proving from the round table that knight errants were accustomed to eat like other persons. See part i. canto 1, line 337. Mr. Hals says this is the place called Donecheniv in Domesday Survey. Dunechine, would mean the fortress or a chasm, corresponding precisely with the situation. Joseph of Exeter, from whom Mr. Hals has translated some lines on this place, is mentioned with great commen dation in Warton's History of English Poetry : \" But a miracle of this age in classical composition was Joseph of Exeter, commonly called Josephus Iscanus. He wrote two epic poems in Latin heroic verse. The first is on the Tro jan War; it is in six books, and dedicated to Baldwin Archbishop of Canterbury. The second is entitled An tiocheis, The War of Antioch, or the Crusade. The former is preserved ; but a fragment only remains of the latter, found in the library of Abingdon Abbey. In the retreat of Gothlouis before Uter Pendragon, Mr. Hals mentions Exeter under the name of Caer Iske, but without much commendation of the martial spirit pos sessed by its inhabitants. If either Iske is the proper name ot this river, or the general term for a river has been changed into Ex, the Celtic name will exactly accord with the present Ex-cester, as the word is still pronounced in Devonshire, the camp or fortress on the Ex.

It is entirely situated on rocks belonging to the calcareous series. In the southern part, itaf rocks consist of clay slates possessing various degrees of fissibility, from the most perfect roofing-slate of Delabole, to a slate that can only be separated into thick flags. Amongst these strata occurs an interesting rock, which appears to be com posed of hornblende and compact felspar, and in some parts of hornblende and calcareous spar only. The latter variety is well known in the neighbourhood under the name of green freestone, and may be seen in the walls of the oldest churches. It is in situ in a croft near the pretty little waterfall of Nathan's or Kneighton's Kieve. Iii the northern part of the parish, near King Arthur's Castle, and in Bossiney Cove, the slate is very talcose, and is occasionally coated at its joints with calcareous spar. At the former place also occurs a large mass of compact felspar, but which is so much decomposed that its precise nature has not been ascertained. In the sea-cliffs are several slate-quarries, the quality of which, however, is inferior to the Delabole, and is known in the market by the name of cliff slate. In this slate are impressions appa rently derived from shells, which have been referred to the genus producta. This is the only instance of a fossiliferous slate hitherto detected in Cornwall, though it is probable that others may exist, particularly between St. German's and the Rame Head."], [386, "344 ST.

Trewinard, taxed in Domesday Roll, by the name of Trewinerder, id est, the high, haughty, beloved town, alias Trewinar, id est, the town of the beloved lake or river of water, on which those lands are situate, viz. the Hayle River, gave name and origin to an old family of gentlemen sur named De Trewinard, who flourished here for many genera tions in genteel degree down to the latter end of the reign of King Henry VIII. at which time John Trewinard, Esq. was Member of Parliament for the borough of St. Ives, and so became privileged against his creditors, being a man much encumbered with debts, who during the intervals of parlia ment kept house here and stood upon his guard, at which time one of his creditors obtained judgment and outlawry against him, after three terms in the county court, broke his"], [387, "345 ST. EARTH. house, took his person, and carried him prisoner to the sheriff's ward, where he remained till the next session of parliament, against which time he brought his writ of habeas corpus, and was brought up to Westminster in expectation of great damages against his creditor that put him in du rance. Upon this restraint of Mr. Trewinard's person, the house resolved not to sit, looking upon it as a breach of privilege, but entered before their rising into a grand com mittee for hearing this case pro and con, betwixt Trewinard and his creditor, when it appeared as aforesaid Trewinard was outlawed and so out of the king's protection, and till that outlawry was reversed he could not lawfully sit as a member ; by which expedient Trewinard was forced to com pound with his creditor and sue forth the king's pardon, and then appeared in parliament in statu quo prius. This John Trewinard had, as I take it, issue Martin Trewinard, steward of the stannaries, who had issue Deiphobus Tre winard, that in his rage or anger killed an innocent man and buried him secretly in Trewinard Chapel, of public use before the Church of St. Earth was erected ; however, this fact was not so covertly carried, but the coroners of the shire had notice of it, who accordingly came to this place, opened the grave, took forth the body, and impannelled a jury thereon, who upon oath gave their verdict, that this party's death happened by a wilful murder of Trewinard's, whereupon he was carried before a justice of the peace, and upon further examination of this matter, had his mittimus made, and was accordingly sent to Launceston gaol, where he remained till the next assizes. In the mean time, foreseeing that this barbarous fact would tend both to the destruction of his life and estate, he applied to Sir Reginald Mohun, Knight, a favourite of the Queen Elizabeth's, and proposed to him, that he would make over and convey to him, his heirs, and assigns for ever, all his lands and tenements whatsoever, under this proviso or condition, that in case he were condemned for the mur der aforesaid, that he should or would procure the Queen's"], [388, "346 ST. EARTH. pardon or reprieve for his life ; which proposal being ac- cepted by Sir Reginald Mohun, lease and release of his lands were made and executed for a valuable consideration accordingly to him, bearing date the day before this tragical fact was committed, whereupon Sir Reginald Mohun forth- with became seised of this barton and manor of Trewinard, and at the next assizes held for this county, Mr. Trewinard being indicted for this murder, was found guilty by the grand and petty juries, and accordingly condemned to be hanged to death, at which instant Sir Reginald Mohun having gotten the Queen's reprieve or pardon for Mr. Tre- winard, put it into the sheriff's hands, whereby his execu- tion was stopped, and himself afterwards, on sureties for his good behaviour, was set at liberty from the gaol, and sub sisted upon some small stipend allowed him by Sir Reginald out of his lands during life. The arms of Trewinard are yet extant in the glass win dows of this house, viz. in a field Argent, a fess Azure, be tween three Cornish daws Proper. Sir Reginald Mohun took such pleasure in this place, that at some times he lived on it in the middle of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and finally settled it upon his three daughters, one of whom was mar ried to Sir Thomas Arundell, of Talvorne, Knight. Sir Thomas Arundell's part of the premises was pur chased by Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongallan, Knight, who having leases of the other two parts, some time also for plea sure resided on this barton, whose son and heir John Hals sold the same. The present possessor of one third part in fee, and two third parts in lease of this barton and manor, from Praed and Penrose, as I take it, is Thomas Hawkins, Gent, who giveth for his arms the same bearing as Mr. Hawkins, of Creed. Such another tragical story of murder is to be seen under Falmouth district, as also in Prince's Worthies of Devon, how that Sir John Prideaux, of Orchardton, killed in a duel Sir William Bigberry, of Bigberry, Knight, whose ances-"], [389, "347 ST. EARTH. tors from the Norman Conquest had lived there, in wor shipful degree, for nine descents, to the year 1360, when the two daughters and heirs of this murdered gentleman were married to Champernowne, of Beer Ferries, and Durneford, of Stonehouse. By this misfortune Prideaux being condemned to be hanged, gave most of his estate to obtain his pardon from Edward the Third. In like manner he tells us that Sir Alexander Cruwys, Knt. temp. Henry VI. slew one Mr. Carew, and for that fact was condemned to be hanged, but in order to procure his reprieve or pardon, he sold twenty-two manors of land. Also that John Copleston, of Copleston, in Devon, Esq. commonly called the Great Copleston, in the middle of Queen Elizabeth's reign, in a rage slew his natural son and godson, for which fact he was condemned to the gallows, but in order to procure a reprieve or pardon, he was forced to sell thirteen manors of land in Cornwall. His son left only two daughters that became his heirs, married to Copleston and Elford. Lastly, he further tells us that Sir John Fitz, of Fitz ford, Knight, slew in a rage one Mr. Slannen, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, after which fact, posting away to Lon don, with his servant, in order to get his pardon, and at every stage shutting his chamber door, for fear of being taken where he lodged, it happened in the night that his servant knocking violently at his chamber door with some intelligence, and he not well awaked out of his sleep, or not well understanding his servant's voice in the dark, he rushed to the door, shot off a pistol, and slew his own servant, which as soon as he understood, he took another pistol and shot himself dead also.

It is now in the possession of Thomas Haw kins, Gent, attorney at law, that married, first, the daughter of James Praed, Esq.: and secondly, Anne, the daughter of Christopher Bellot, of Bochim, Esq. By the first he has only one daughter, but by the second a nu merous issue. He giveth for his arms, in a field Argent, a saltire Sable, charged with five fleurs-de-lis Or. Mr. Hawkins owns but a third part of the mansion and"], [392, "350 ST. EARTH. barton of Trewinard, of which Sir John St. Aubin, and Mr. James Praed, are joint lords with him. Mr. Thomas Haw kins is since dead; and this is now the seat of his son Christopher Hawkins, Esq. and Clerk of the Assizes. He hath married Mary, one of the daughters of Philip Hawkins, of Pennance, Esq. I take the etymology of this name, Trewinard, to be a town or dwelling on a marsh. The Trewinards lived here probably before the Norman Conquest, and were once possessed of an estate worth at the least three thousand pounds per annum, as I have been in formed by one of their descendants, the late Rev. Mr. James Trewinard, Rector of St. Mawgor in Meneage. James De Trewinard was one of the Knights ofthe Shire for Cornwall 20 Edward III. William De Trewinard was so likewise in the 28th year of this reign. Martin De Trewinard, Esq. (whom Mr. Carew calls a merry Cornish gentleman, and tells a comical story of) I believe was the last of them that possessed this estate, for Norden, who wrote his description of Cornwall towards the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, saith, that Trewinard was the seat of Mannering. Trelisick, compounded of Tre-lis-ick, a dulling on the broad creek, suitable to its situation on that part of the river Hayle, where it openeth itself into a lake, is the seat of the ancient family of Painter. The present owner of which is Francis Painter, Esq. formerly one of the Clerks of the Admiralty, and now General Receiver of the Prize Money which shall become due to captors. He married a daughter of Sutherland, Esq. late one of the Clerks of the Admiralty, by whom he has only one surviving son Mr. James Painter. His arms are, Azure, three slabs of tin Argent, each charged with an annulet Sable. Mr. Francis Painter is since dead, leaving two daughters by his second wife, a daughter of his uncle Mr. Francis. Painter, of Boskina in Burian. William Painter, D.D. Rector of Exeter College in Oxford, was also a brother of his father Arthur Painter."], [393, "351 ST. EARTH. Painter, of Antron, was, I am informed, a younger branch of this family7, and arrived at considerable eminence, but, like many branches, it has withered, while the parent stock remains fair and flourishing. But the family of Tre lisick is now extinct in the male line, by the death of Mr. Francis Painter, jun. THE EDITOR. St. Earth, now invariably written without the a, is sup posed to derive its name from St. Ergan, one of the female missionaries from Ireland. The church stands at the side of what must have been an estuary in former times, pretty much like Egleshayle, near Wadebridge. The church is neat and plain, with three ailes of equal height, the roof has wooden ribs with bosses, and the whole was plastered about the year 1747. The tower is not inferior to most others, and the south porch is remarkable for its beauty. The whole eastern extremity of the south aile is said to have belonged exclusively to Tre winnard, but for want of asserting it, the right has been lost. The walls of the church were covered with sentences, and the windows were ornamented by stained glass, but in the great repair bestowed on the church in 1747, all these were removed, as it is said, by the zeal of Mr. Collins, at that time Vicar, against all vestiges of the religion professed by our forefathers. A few small panes of glass only7 remain, and the cross engrailed Sable, on a field Or (the arms of Mahon), can alone be distinguished. The south wall ofthe church is supported by a continued buttress, added about the year 1760. On a slab stone, just before the communion table, is the following inscription : Here lyeth the body of the below named John Ralph, who ended this life the 10th of Feb. anno Dom\u2122 1729, in the 85th year of his age.

Here lyeth the body of Loveday, the wife of John Ralph, Vicar of this parish, by whom he had three children, Mary, John, and Loveday ; the last died in her infancy. The other two were alive at their mother's death. She was a virtuous and prudent wife, a loving and indulgent mother, a friendly and prudent neighbour, and very charitable to the poor. She exchanged this life for a better the last dav of November, in the year of our Lord 1715, and in the 82d year of her age. \" Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, yea, saith the spirit, that they rest from their labour.\" Rev. xiv. 13.

The six letters stand for, Hoc Mannor Loco Monu menti Poni Curavit. Mr. Collins died in October 1755, and was buried under the same stone, but without any additional inscription. Mr. Edward Collins was the eldest son of John Collins, Esq. of Treworgan, in St. Erme, and brother of Mr. John Collins, Rector of Redruth. He studied for some years at the Temple, with the view of being called to the bar, and it is said that he became a clergyman from principles of con science. Mr. Collins retained uniformly through life the respect of all around him ; he appears to have been a man of learn ing and of taste, but of austere manners. I have heard from one who was present, that Mr. and Mrs. Collins meeting accidentally, at a neighbouring gentleman's, a' lady who was not of the Established Church, they refused to hold any conversation with her. Their only son, Mr. John Collins, Vicar of Ledbury in Herefordshire, supported the reputation derived from his father. He distinguished himself as a man of letters on va rious occasions ; one of the editors of Shakspeare left his library to Mr. Collins, in gratitude for assistance afforded him, and there may be found a very curious note at the con clusion of Troilus and Cressida, in the edition by Johnson and Steevens, with Mr. Collins's name subscribed. The next Vicar of St. Earth was Mr. Symonds, who ac quired the living through a curious combination of circum stances. Mr. John Stephens, the principal merchant at St. Ives, and agent for the Earl of Buckinghamshire in the ma- 2a"], [396, "354 ST. EARTH. nagement of the borough, was a zealous Presbyterian. The living of St. Ives with Lelant, had been designed for some young man of the town, who indiscreetly, and probably in joke, declared that when he succeeded to the church he would preach furiously against Presbyterians, and teach that Hell itself was strewed over with their bones. This was said in a garden, in defiance of the Cornish proverb, Nynges gun heb lagas, na kei heb scover. \" There is no downs without eyes, nor hedge or wall without ears.\" And Mr. Stephens walking in a garden adjoining overheard this declaration, and in consequence exerted his influence' with the patron to obtain the living from the Bishop of Exeter for one who might prove less unfavourably disposed towards his sect, the only one at that time considered as formidably hostile to the Established Church; and to ensure this object Mr. Symonds was selected, because his father, who exercised the trade of a barber at Cambridge, discharged also the office of clerk to a Presbyterian meeting-house. Mr. Symonds was received as a friend at St. Ives, and elected into the Corporation. But in the course of a few years a violent struggle arose respecting the election of a Recorder, when Mr. Symonds most prudently considering that nothing further was likely to be obtained from those who had already given him a living, sold himself to the opposite party, carried the election for them by his casting vote, and received the living of St. Earth. See various Essays in the London Magazine, with the signature Y. Z. for 1767, pp. 225, 456, 464, 628; for 1768, pp. 25, 199, 575; for 1769, pp. 18, 235, 578. Mr. Symonds died in 1775, and was succeeded by Mr. George Rhodes, of Devonshire, some time a Fellow of Exeter College. This gentleman having obtained prefer ment near his immediate connections, resigned the living in 1781, and was succeeded by Mr. Mayow, of Bray near Looe, who never resided, and died in the year 1 800, when the benefice was given to Mr. Samuel Gurney, recently de ceased (1833) and to whose memory a marble slab has been"], [397, "ST. EARTH. 355 immediately placed over the chancel door by his mother, in her ninety-fourth year. The glebe land is more extensive and of greater value than in most other parishes, and the vicarage house is one ofthe best in Cornwall, a new front having been added by Mr. Collins, and some improvements made by Mr. Rhodes. There is also a rectorial glebe ; and a large house near the eastern end of the bridge, stands on the spot where for merly was a barn for receiving the tithe corn. There is a third slab stone in memory of Mr. Richard Shuckburgh, brother to the well-known mathematician and astronomer of Shuckborough, in Warwickshire. Mr. Humphrey Williams, then the resident curate, had mar ried Miss Sarah Bate, his half-sister, who is also buried in St. Earth's church. The church-yard is still too small for the parish, notwith standing its being enlarged in the year 1817, chiefly at the expense of the Editor, and by virtue of a general Act of parliament which he brought into the House of Commons for that express purpose, 56 Geo. III. c. 141. The bridge is said by Leland to have been constructed two hundred years before his time, or about five hundred years ago. The causeway is very long, but there were ori ginally only three small arches. A fourth, somewhat larger, has been added at the eastern end. The roadway was so narrow that a single carriage had, at one part, great diffi culty to pass, and the whole created a large expense to the county, occasioned by accidents to the walls, and by wheels always running in the same track. In the year 1816, the Editor procured a grant of fifty pounds, and, expending somewhat more than an equal sum himself, he got the road widened sufficiently for all useful purposes, more especially as in the year 1825 a causeway was made across the river, about a mile further down. St. Earth adjoins to no less than seven parishes : Lelant, Ludgvan, St. Hilary, Breage, Crowan, Gwinear, and Phillaek. 2 a2"], [398, "356 ST. EARTH. Trewinnartl has been, without all comparison, the prin cipal place in this parish. I have not any means of affirming or of contradicting the relation of Mr. Hals, as to the tragical event imputed to the last Trewinnard: some indistinct tradition of a murder was handed down to within my remembrance. The trans actions of this gentleman's grandfather with the House of Commons are given by Mr. Hatsell, as derived from authen tic sources, in his Parliamentary Precedents, vol. i. p. 59, of the edition of 1796, and p. 60 in the last edition. I apprehend that he was then Member for Helston. One of the family resided till very lately in the Strand, London ; for, struck by the name \" Trewinnard,\" the Editor was induced to call at the house. Mr. Trewinnard said that his family came, as he had heard, from a town so called in Cornwall, and that he had some old deeds in his possession. These were exhibited, and proved to be leases of various farms in St. Earth parish. The Mohuns appear to have made this place a principal ressdence, for the cross engrailed exhibits itself not only on fragments of painted glass preserved in the church, but also on the seat or pew, quartered or impaled with various arms, and in one instance with the fleur-de lis and the lions, of England and France. Mr. Hals states that the estate was divided between the three daughters of Sir Reginald Mohun; that one of these daughters married Sir Thomas Arundel, of Talvorne, and that his part was purchased by Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fen- tongallon, who had the other two-thirds on leases for lives; but that John Hals sold the whole. It is probable that the purchaser must have been Mr. Bellot, of Bochym, whose daughter brought the one-third freehold, and the two-thirds lease for lives, to Mr. Thomas Hawkins; yet Reginald Mohun is said by Mr. Lysons, under Cury, to have given one of his daughters, with Bochym, to Francis Bellot; through whom Mr. Hawkins, the present posses sor, connects himself with the ancient and baronial family of Mohun."], [399, "ST. EARTH. 357 However Mr. Thomas Hawkins acquired Trewinnard, the property has now been possessed by his family above a century and a half. The first of his ancestors who settled in Cornwall was Mr. John Hawkins, who is said to have come from Kent in the year 1554. He married a daughter of the officiat ing Minister of Blisland. Second, John Hawkins, their son, designated merchant, married JaneTlother or Williams, of Grampound. Third, John Hawkins, gent, married Paschas, daughter of Joseph Cooke, of Mevagissey. Fourth, Thomas Hawkins, who died in the lifetime of his father, married Adry, daughter of Crudge. Fifth, John Hawkins, gent, married Loveday, daughter of George Trenhayle. Sixth, Thomas Hawkins, their son, married, first, Flo rence, daughter of James Praed, esq. of Trevethow, by whom he had one daughter, married to John Williams, of Helston, merchant. Lie married, secondly, Ann, daugh ter and coheir of Christopher Bellott, of Bochym, and died in 1716, leaving one son and one daughter. Seventh, Christopher Hawkins, esq, barrister-at-law, married Mary, daughter and coheir of Philip Hawkins, of Pennance, esq. and practically his sole heiress, as well as of her brother Philip Hawkins, D.D. sometime Master c* Pembroke college, Cambridge. They resided during several years in London, where Mr. Hawkins practised as a lawyer ; but, having lost seve ral children, they determined on removing into the coun try, and finally settled at Trewinnard about the year 1750. They had one daughter, Jane, married to Sir Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. And Eighth, Thomas Hawkins, esq. who married Anne, daughter of James Heywood, esq. a merchant of London.

He was a Fellow of the Royal, Antiquarian, and Horticultural Societies, and published in 1811 \"Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in Cornwall, and on the Ictis of Diodorus Siculus.\" He died unmarried in 1829. Thomas died a young man. John Hawkins, the present representative of the family, celebrated throughout Europe for his general knowledge on all subjects, his science, literature, and travels, especially through Greece, the most interesting portion of the ancient world, married the only daughter of Mr. Sibthorpe, Mem ber for Lincoln, and has two sons and four daughters ; the eldest, Mr. John Heywood Hawkins, is a distinguished Member of the present Parliament. His sister is the widow of Mr. Trelawney Brereton. The house at Trewinnard has been so much altered and improved since 1N^| Christopher Hawkins came to reside there,,about eighty years ago, as scarcely to leave a trace of what it had been in former times; but the garden remains, a pleasing specimen of cut yew, trim box, and thorn hedges. There was also a building, detached from the house, sup posed to have bee \"the ancient chapel, although, I think, inaccurately, as it stood north and south. One of the up stairs rooms has tapestry representing the victory of Con stantine, with his celebrated vision of the Cross. But, above all, here are preserved the remains of an old coach, suspended on long leathers without springs, and in general form corresponding with the coach exhibited by the Lord Mayor of London. I believe, however, that it is much less ancient than has generally been supposed, and it has been in actual use within seventy years. Trewinnard has the advantage of a stream of water, brought with great art over very uneven ground from a distance of two or three miles, conducted into almost every field, and supplying the house."], [401, "359 ST. EARTH. The place of next importance in this parish is Trelisick. Perhaps the etymology of this word may be tre-les-ick, the town on the inclosed water, les, or lis, being an inclosed place; and the river Hayle here expands itself into the appearance of a lake ; and the same circumstance applies to Trelesick as the head of Falmouth harbour. The tale related by Mr. Hals respecting the change of name from De Camborne to Paynter, does not seem very probable. I remember, however, a man of that family who was a house-painter, and who would be driven into most violent fits of passion when boys hallooed after him, \"Painter by name and painter by nature.\" Mr. Francis Paynter is said to have married, first, a daughter of Sutherland, Esq. one of the Clerks of the Admiralty, and to have had by her one son, who died in his father's lifetime. I apprehend that this son, James, too warmly espousing the politics then most popular in Cornwall, took an active part in proclaiming King James on the death of Queen Anne ; that he was indicted by the victorious party, acquitted at Launceston, and welcomed by bonfire and by ball from thence to the Land's End. Of the two daughters by his second marriage, with his cousin of Boskenna, one made a most imprudent match with a foreigner, and settled in France, leaving many descendants. The other daughter, Mary, born in 1709, married a very respectable gentleman, Mr. Hearle, of Penryn. They acquired the other sister's share of the property by pur- chase, and the whole is now equally divided between the families of her three daughters. One married the Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne, of Heligon ; another Francis Rodd, Esq. of Trebather; and the third Capt. Wallis, of the Royal Navy, well known for his^discovery of Otaheite, in a voyage round the world. The house at Trelisick has been greatly reduced in size ; but the whole place continues to bear the appearance of a gentleman's seat, and the property is much improved by the rapid advance of trade and of establishments at Hayle."], [402, "360 ST. EARTH. This portion of the Hearle and Paynter estate has heen assigned to Mr. Francis Hearle Rodd. The place next of importance in this parish was pro bably fredrea. The name, perhaps, imports the thorough fare town, as it lies on the way from Trewinnard to the church. There was here a large house inhabited by a family of the same name, who appear in the parish register two centuries ago as Esquires, a distinction then sparingly applied. The property is said to have passed, by a mortgage unredeemed, to the St. Aubyns of Crowan, who granted it on a lease for lives, in the year 16S5, to Mr. Matthew Phillips. One of his daughters married Mr. John Davies, younger brother of Henry Davies, Esq. of Bosence. Mr. John Davies had a daughter, Catherine Davies, eventually heiresss of her brother Henry Davies, and through him of her father and uncle. Her son is the Editor of this work. The old house at Tredrea having fallen into a state of decay, Mr. Henry Davies took it down about the year 1750, and built small a neat house on the same spot, where the Editor still occasionally resides. Bosence, in St. Earth, has belonged time out of mind, (cer tainly from before the reign of Henry the Seventh,) to the fa mily of Davies. On it there is a very perfect Roman entrench ment ; and various articles of Roman workmanship, found on removing the earth, are described and figured by Dr. W. Borlase, in his Antiquities of Cornwall, p. 316, edit. 1759; and also in a Paper communicated to the Royal Society in 1759, vol. xi. p. 322, ofthe Abridgment; and the Articles themselves having been presented by Mr. Henry Davies to Dr. Borlase, were by him deposited in the Ashmolean Mu seum at Oxford, where they are now preserved. Another Roman intrenchment, but much less perfect, is situated on the summit of the hill on the south side ofthe road leading eastward, at about half a mile distant from St. Earth bridge : this is mentioned by Leland. The Editor availed himself"], [403, "361 ST. EARTH. of an opportunity for purchasing it about ten years ago, to prevent its further destruction. In the church-yard are several monuments to the Da vieses, particularly one to Mr. William Davies, the Editor's great-grandfather. A flat stone, lying on a raised grave, having the arms of Davies, a chevron between three mullets pierced, impaled with the ancient arms of Noye, Azure, three crosses botony in a bend Argent. The more recent arms are, Argent, three bendlets and a canton Sable, on the canton a cross ofthe Field. There is this inscription round the edge. Here lieth the body of William Davies, of Bosworgy, in this parish, Gent, who was buried the 28th day of February, in the 54th year of his age, anno 1690. On the middle of the stone : Virtus post funera vivit. Must death divide us now, and close thine eyes? How shall I live, when thou art gone, to hear Our children's cries?

There is a vault belonging to the family of Hawkins; and Mr. Christopher Hawkins, in 1767, and his widow, Mrs. Mary Hawkins, in 1780, are laid in it, I believe with some of their children ; but there is not any inscription. Perthcolumb presents some appearance of antiquity. There is a tradition of its once having given a sheriff to the county. The place now belongs to Mr. Andrew Hos kin, descended from a very ancient family in the adjoining parish of Lelant. Gear has a good house, once the seat of another branch of the Davieses, but bought by the Editor's father. Tregethes belonged for several descents to the Penroses. It is now the property of Mr. Ellis, who resides in it. About the year 1782, a mill was constructed on a part of Trewinnard, for rolling copper and iron, by a company established at Hayle thirty years before, on the supposed patriotic principle of smelting our own copper ore; but, after many years of competition against the smelting- works in Wales, it was discovered that one shipload of copper ore required three shiploads of coal, and that by importing coal from Swansea to work the steam-engine, and by ex porting the ores to be smelted there, vessels were enabled to obtain cargoes in both directions ; and, in consequence, the works at Trewinnard and at Hayle are no longer em ployed for their original purposes. The rage for importing coals to reduce our own ores at home, which was epidemic about the middle of the last century, seems to have originated from a confusion of ideas in the application of analogies, the most abundant source of error. It would be absurd to send our food across the seas to be roasted or boiled ; therefore the same principle was extended to copper ore. These establishments were, however, maintained for some considerable time by the genius and the abilities of one man. Mr. John Edwards had been taken as a clerk for general business by Mr. Hawkins, just at the time when he"], [407, "365 ST. EARTH. and other Cornish gentlemen set on the copper-works. Mr. Edwards soon forced himself into the chief manage ment, became a partner, and continued the works during the whole of his life ; not being distinguished merely as a mer chant or manufacturer, but as a scholar and a gentleman. Gurlyn is said by Mr. Lysons to have been the residence of various considerable families. It has, for perhaps a cen tury, been the joint property of Messrs. Gregor and Harris. About the year 1760, Mr. John Millett, possessing a lease of this place for lives, built an entirely new house there ; but the lease has been bought in by the gentleman seised of the freehold, and the house taken down. Treloweth is a manor heretofore the property of the Tredreas. On a part of this manor stands a tin-smelting house. Tin, by the laws of the Stannaries, must be re duced to the metallic state in Cornwall; and much less quantities of coal are required than in the case of copper. Till about the commencement of the last century, all the tin ores of Cornwall were smelted in small blast furnaces, by means of charcoal or of peat. At that period some Germans introduced the reverberatory furnace, and with it the use of coal. Several smelting-houses were immedi ately constructed by the gentlemen of the county, and although not among the first, that at Treloweth. I have ascertained the exact period of its building, from this cir cumstance, that the workmen were interrupted by the total eclipse of the sun, which happened about 15 minutes before nine on the 22d of April, 1715, O. S. Mr. Henry Davies, the Editor's great-uncle, was among those who contributed to the building, and the crest of his arms, a lamb carrying a flag, was adopted as a mark to distinguish the slabs of this house ; all the different smelting and blowing houses having always used specific marks. The crest, had, I presume, been originally taken in allusion to the Welch and Cornish sound, at least of his name ; davas being Cornish for a sheep, or perhaps a shepherd. This mark, however, conveyed to the minds of persons in VOL. i. 2 A 7"], [408, "366 ST. EARTH. Catholic countries some idea of consecration, and pro cured a preference for the Lamb Tin, although it never claimed to have the slightest superiority ; and finally, all the other houses have taken the same, or similar marks. Among the Germans who introduced the reverberatory furnace, was the celebrated Becker. His son became a bricklayer, and his grandson's widow died about twenty five years ago in the poorhouse at St. Earth. The Rev. John Ralph, Vicar of Ingatestone, son of the Vicar of St. Earth, gave in 1754 a hundred pounds to wards founding a school at St. Earth, to be applied as Mr. Collins, the then Vicar, and Mr. Hawking, of Trewinnard, should direct. Some portion ofthe 100/. was expended in repairing a small house in the church-yard. The re mainder, together with another hundred pounds, given by Mr. Hawkins, remain in aid of the schoolmaster.

Park, that is, a field of any sort, otherwise in this parish it signifies a deer-park, was one of the ancient seats of the Peverells, lineally descended from William the Conqueror, by Jane his concubine, the wife of Randolph Peverell, of Hatfield-Peverell parish, in Witham Decanatus, in the county of Essex, who abdicated the said Jane, and left her wholly on the Conqueror's hands, who had issue by her a son, named William Peverell, (who, because born during the joint marriage and lives of the said Randolph and Jane, was surnamed Peverell,) upon whom the Conqueror settled the honor, manor, and borough of Nottingham, and town ofLyndeby, on him, and his heirs male.

Thomas Peverell, of Park, a supposed descendant of the Conqueror's son, who was also of Ermington and Sand ford, in Devon, was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Richard II. He was also Sheriff of Devon 20 Richard II. Richard Peverell, his son, was Sheriff of Devon 14 Henry IV. who dying without issue male, his lands went in marriage with his daughter, married to Basset of Umberleigh, Botreaux, and others. f t On this lordship of Park those gentlemen had their deer-park, some of the walls and fences being yet standing ; their tower-house, and other buildings answerable, their gardens, walk, and fish-ponds beneath the same, the ruins whereof are yet extant. How those lands descended down from Peverell's heirs to the last age I know not ; about which time it was in the possession of Opie and Hickes; from whom it passed by sale to the Hon. John Molesworth, temp. Queen Anne, as 1 take it. The arms of Peverell were, Gules, a fess Argent between six crosses pattee Or. Those Peverells are especially memorable here by two crosses of moorstone in the highway set up by them, still extant, and called Peverell's Crosses. Not far from them is another moorstone cross, near Mount-Charles, called the Prior's Cross, whereon is cut the figure of a hook and a crook, in memory of that privilege and freedom granted by him to the poor of Bodmin, for gathering, for fire-boote and house-boote, such boughs and branches of oak-trees in his contiguous wood of Dunmear, as they could reach to or come at with a hook and a crook, without further damage to the trees thereof. From whence arose the Cornish pro verb, concerning filching, purloining, or taking another person's goods, overmuch or indirectly, beyond what is allowed them, &c. \" that they will have it by hook or by crook.\" Pen-carou, Pen-caro, alias Pen-carow, i. e. head-deer, or chief-deer, formerly part of the Peverell's deer-park ; and from thence so denominated, as some think.

From which gen tleman, as I am informed, was lineally descended John Molesworth, Esq. aforesaid, that married Hender, and by her had issue, Hender Molesworth, Esq. that married Spark of Plymouth, and by her had issue my very kind friend John Molesworth, Esq. and Hender Molesworth, with a daughter married to Dr. Hart; the which John Molesworth married two wives, Wise, and Slannen, the relict of Legard, afterwards knighted by Charles the Second, and had issued by Wise, John Molesworth, Esq. that married Arscott of Tetcot, and hath issue, Hender Molesworth aforesaid, the son of Hender Molesworth, who being bred a soldier, managed affairs with that valour and conduct, that, after passing gradually to the dignity of a colonel, he was by King James the Second made a baronet of England, and governor of the Island of Jamaica, where he purchased a considerable estate in land, and called it Tremolesworth, which, together with his honour (if he died without issue male, according to the limitation of his letters patent as a baronet), is now legally descended to Sir John Molesworth, of Pencarow, Bart. The arms of Molesworth are, Vaire, a bordure Gules, charged with eight cross crosslets Argent. Kestell, in this parish, i. e. a castle, so called, I presume, for that heretofore it had upon the lands thereof some camp or castle-like intrenchment, for kestell is derived from the provincial Latin of the Romans in Britain, castrum, or castellum ; which place gave name and original to an old family of gendemen, surnamed de Kestell. The"], [413, "EGLES-HAYLE. 371 first possessor thereof of this tribe, as appears from the record in the Office of Arms, was John de Kestell, temp. Edward I. where his posterity have ever since flourished, to the time of writing hereof, in good fame and reputation, between the degrees of a justice of the peace and that of a hundred constable; the present possessor James Kestell, Gent, that married Vaughan of Trewothick and Ottery, in Devon, his father Kestell of Manacow, and giveth for his arms, Argent, three falcons Proper; as also, Or, three castles turreted Gules. (See Kestel, in Manaccan.) Pen-davy, or Pen-duffy, i. e.

Crone, Croan, in this parish, signifies a skin or hide of leather; so called either from the tanner that made or sold leather here, or rather for that this tenement con sisteth in quanto of a hide or skin of land, viz. as much arable ground as one plough can cultivate in a year, com monly reckoned about eighty statute acres. This barton was formerly the lands of Roscarrcck, by whom it was sold to Michael Hill, Gent, by whose son, John Hill, Rector of St. Mabyn, it was sold to Edward Hoblyn, Gent, attorney at-law, a younger branch of the Nanswhiddon family by the Hoblyns of Bodmin, now in possession thereof. He is especially memorable for his saying, when first he began to practice, \" that he would get an estate by the law one way or other,\" viz. right or wrong, and common fame saith he was as good as his word, in the worst* sense.

It was since sold to Mr. Hoblyn. In this parish is Castle Killy-biry, or Killy-biny, consist ing of about six acres of ground upon a well-advanced hill, within a treble intrenchment of earth. Perhaps one of the castles possessed by that arch-traitor the Pictish Mordred, slain by King Arthur, (see Dundagell,) from whence his soldiers were routed ; for the circumstance of this castle on the Alan river may agree with those verses men tioned under Lentegies by Camelford, for the river Camel is properly called the Alan river, as well as Camel. Below Egles-hayle church (on the Alan river as afore said), where the sea creek or cove of Padstow Haven makes its daily flux and reflux, stands Ward Bridge, i. e. guard or watch bridge; otherwise, as Mr. Carew says, called Wade Bridge, from a little ford near it, which afforded, when the tide was out, a short but dangerous passage over it. But where this little vadum, or ford, should be, I know not, there being no other river to pass over from east to west but the Alan river aforesaid. Which bridge, as an artificial ligament, fasteneth the two parishes of Egles-hayle and St. Breock together, they being in all other places separated by the river. It was built in the latter end of Edward the Fourth's reign, and begin ning of Llenry the Seventh's ; not, as Leland says, at the county charge, but, as all other works of this kind were, viz. by collections, and commutation of penance for sins"], [415, "373 EGLES-HAYLE. committed ; for it was not made a county bridge till the beginning of James the First's reign. Now this licence of all spiritual benedictions, collection, and commutation of penance, throughout the counties of Cornwall and Devon, was there granted by Dr. Peter Courtenay, Bishop of Exeter, to Thomas Longbound, then Vicar of Egles-hayle, his chaplain or vicar, 1485, who raised a considerable sum of money by that means, viz. of absolution, as also from charitable and well-disposed Christians. The undertaker, that expert mason John de Harlyn, and the treasurer Long bound, brought the bridge's building to that perfection as it now stands, consisting of seventeen arches of stone of great height and magnitude, all built with great cost and labour, through which (as aforesaid) the sea passes up and down daily through the Alan river to Tagus, (i. e. Goodwood,) a mile, and is navigable for boats, barges, and lighters, to that place, which there bring sea sand, and other commo dities, for the country-people's use. On the lower side of the bridge, from Padstow Haven, ships and barks laden with merchandise frequently arrive, of burthen from twenty to sixty tons, from Bristol, Wales, Ireland, and other places, where their commodities have better vent than at Padstow, two or three miles below, nearer the main sea. Leland, in his Itinerary, tells us, volume the second, that some of the arches of this bridge were laid upon quick sand, which for some time made the treasurer and under taker despair of success, till they projected the laying of packs of wool under the groundwork, which proved such a useful expedient as carried on the fabric according to their desire, and the same stands firm to this day. After this bridge was erected, Longbound, the vicar, gave a small parcel of land towards the repair thereof, now worth 20/. per annum, and enfeoffed the twelve men of this parish, and their successors, in trust with the same for ever. There are also other lands in St. Breock, given by"], [416, "374 EGLES-HAYLE. the Prior of Bodmin, and other well-affected benefactors to the bridge, for the same purpose. At present this bridge stock is about 300/. and is set at the yearly rent for about 10/. per annum. Lastly, this just and indefatigable benefactor Longbound, after he had finished the bridge, with the, moneys and stones left, caused to be built the tower of Egles-hayle church, as it now stands; over the belfry-door of which, in stone, on the north side, are cut in an escutcheon his arms, viz. a human heart, and super scribed Longbound. On the other side of the door afore said are cut, impaled, a chevron between two falcons, and a chevron between three ravens' heads. Which first I take to be the arms of Kestell, and the latter of Ravens croft of Cheshire, his wife. From this parish was denominated an old family of gen tlemen surnamed de Egles-hayle, of which family was Ma theus de Egleshayle, Sheriff of Devon from the 1st year of Edward the First to the 6th, who gave for his arms, Argent, a cross Sable, and a fleur-de-lis in the first quarter. TONKIN. In this parish stands the lordship and barton of Pen carrow, which name may signify a deer-park. But I take the name of Pencarrow to be of a much more ancient date than the first bringing of deer into this land, and that the name is taken from the natural circumstances of the place, as compounded of pen-car-ow, head-rock-ry, for in- this place is digged a quarry of bright clear freestone, that works with tool, plane, or hammer, equal to any other in Cornwall, as may be seen by the beautiful house Sir John Molesworth has built with it, and which is not yet quite finished. And surely it may be said of this barton, with out disparagement to any other man's lands, that for wood, water, and stone, it may compare with, if not exceed, any other part of the kingdom; neither do the lands come"], [417, "375 EGLES-HAYLE. behind any in the neighbourhood for fruitfulness. It is the seat of Sir John Molesworth, Knt. and Bart, who was knighted by Charles the Second, and succeeded to the title of baronet by the issueless decease of his younger brother, Sir Hender Molesworth, Governor of Jamaica, who left him a considerable estate in that island, and was the first baronet created by William the Third. This family is a younger branch of the descendants of Sir Wal ter de Molesworth, of Northamptonshire, who flourished in martial prowess in the days of Edward the First, and went with him to the Holy Land. John Molesworth, son of the above Sir John Molesworth, married the daugh ter of Arscot, Esq. of Tetcot, in Devonshire. Kestle. The very name implies that heretofore it was a fortified place.

Pendavy, the good promontory, is situated on a hill forming a peninsula by the river Alan, on the west side, and a rivulet which has two heads, one in St. Teath and the other in St. Mabyn, on the east side. Here dwelleth Nathaniel Moyle, Esq. a younger brother of Sir Walter Moyle, of Bake ; to whom, by his marriage with Johan, the daughter and heir of Thomas Kestle, of this place, Esq. the lordship descended. Mr. Moyle having only one son, of the same name as himself, by this marriage, that died unmarried about four years since, and being some thing indebted, sold this lordship (which claimeth a royalty over all the river, and the bushelage of all goods brought up to Wade bridge) for a very considerable value (reserv ing his own and his lady's lives on the barton), in the year 1703, to Michael Ustick, Gent, collector of Bideford, and"], [418, "376 EGLES-HAYLE. second brother to Oliver Ustick, of Lea, in St. Burian, Gent. The Harbour of Padstow is navigable every tide up to this place, where vessels of sixty or seventy tons carry and recarry their loading of such commodities as the country needs, coal, salt, limestone, &c. and here they find gene rally a better vent for their goods than at Padstow, near the mouth of the river, which has occasioned the building of some houses on each side of the bridge, but mostly on the eastern, where are indifferent good quarters for travel lers, who are sometimes forced to stop here against their wills, there being no passing over the bridge to the west in high spring tides, by reason that the ground on the western side is very low, and at such times overflowed with the sea.

Wade Bridge has a considerable number of houses on both sides of the river ; and I apprehend that no inconve nience is now experienced from high tides on the western side. A toll has been levied for some years past, in aid of the revenue left for its repair; and in this year (1833) a radway, or tram road, is being constructed from thence to Bodmin. Pendavy was inhabited by Mr. Ustick, the son or suc cessor of Mr. Richard Ustick, who made the purchase. This gentleman married Catherine Trewren, daughter of the Rev. Richard Trewren, of Trewardreva, Rector of Withyell, and Catherine Davies, of St. Earth. Mr. Ustick parted with Pendavy from a cause similar to that which induced the former proprietor to sell it ; and"], [419, "377 EGLES-KERRY. his widow, left without a family, or much provision, resided at Padstow till her decease in 1791. Pendavy now belongs to Sir William Molesworth. Crowan was given by the will of Mrs. Damaris Kirkham to her first cousin, the Rev.

In the Domesday Roll, 20 William I. (1087), this district was taxed under the name of Pen-hall-an, now Penheale, then and still the voke lands of a considerable manor. Soon after the Norman Conquest, if not before, the De Boterells, alias De Botreauxes, were possessed of this place; for in the time of Henry the Second and Richard the First, Richard de Botreaux held 12 knights' fees in Corn- wall (Carew's Survey thereof, p. 49) ; one of which was held of the King in this place by his posterity to the 3d Henry the Fourth'; where we further read, p. 41 : \" Wil- liam de Boteraux tenet dimid. part. feod. de Morton, in Penhele, de Rege.\" From the Botreauxes, for want of issue male, those lands, by a daughter, with much other, were carried in marriage to Hungerford; as Hungerfords' heirs, in like manner, carried it to Hastings.

Mr. John Speccot died in August 1703, without issue, and gave a great deal to charitable uses ; but he devised the bulk of his estate to the heirs of his aunt, and, after many lawsuits and disputes, his first cousin, Thomas Long, came into possession of Penhele.

This gentleman represented Camelford in Parlia- ment, and was Lieutenant-Colonel ofthe Cornwall Militia. He survived his wife, and acquired through her a third part of the Long property, which, with all his other pos- sessions, he bequeathed in equal portions to his two bro- thers, Mr. Jonathan Phillipps, a Captain with him in the militia, and the Rev. William Phillipps, Rector of Lante glos, the parish including Camelford. These two brothers came to some arrangement with the two sisters, by which this share of Penhale at least reverted to them. The third sister, Margaret Long, first married Mr. Charles Davie, of the family settled at Orleigh, in Devon shire. He carried on, however, some business in Bristol, and is said to have been in very bad circumstances. He died after a few years, and in her old age the widow was induced to marry Mr. John Bridlake Herring, a Major in the army, who resorted to all possible methods for extort ing money from the old lady ; one that will scarcely be credited, by terrifying her with supposed apparitions. The three sisters are reputed to have excelled in beauty of per son, but to have been so utterly neglected in their educa tion, as scarcely to possess the common acquirement of reading. The Editor remembers to have seen Penhale and the old lady in 1788. Her appearance, then near eighty, justified the report respecting her youth , and the house seemed to rank among the very finest specimens of ancient buildings in Cornwall, as well for size as for architectural decoration.

Egles-Kerry is almost entirely situated on that extensive chain of downs, which runs across the country from Laun ceston to the Bristol Channel ; composed of rocks which are very quartzose, but in many parts appear to be almost entirely felspar, commonly, however, united with some colouring material which stains them to a dark blue. This is particularly the case near the church, where the rocks very strongly resemble those at Rosecradock, and in other parts of St. Cleer. Northward, these rocks pppear to pass into the Dunstone; but it must be confessed that their geological position is not yet elucidated ; for, like the compact rocks of King Arthur's Castle in Tintagel, of St. Stephen's, and Pendre Points, on each side of Padstow Harbour, and elsewhere, they yet require to be carefully and patiently investigated."], [424, "382 ST.

This is that Delian taxed in Domesday Roll, 20th William I. (1087,) and refers to the name of the tutelar guardian and patron of this church, here extant be fore the Norman Conquest, viz. St. Delian, or Telian, a Bri tish saint, said to be made Bishop of Menevia, or Landaff, after St. David's deadi, anno Dom. 563, (see Davidstow,) (who was born in Merionethshire, and had his education under St. Dubritius, Bishop of Landaff, anno Dom. 520,) by whose instruction and piety he became a learned and pious divine, and was furthered and confirmed therein by St. David, afterwards Bishop of Landaff, alias Menevia. This St. Delian accompanied St. David in pilgrimage to Jerusalem, to visit the holy cross and sepulchre, from whence they safely returned again into their own country ; and finding the same greatly infected with the plague, St. Delian, as was generally said, by his sincere and fervent prayers soon delivered that country from the malignity of that fatal disease, which long time before had destroyed great numbers of its inhabitants. He is placed by Harps field and Campion in the Constat of the Bishops of Lan daff, and that he died about the year 570. In this church of St. Delian, (now called Ene-Delian, or Ene-Dellian,) soon after the Norman Conquest, some gentlemen, lords of tenements in this parish, set up and endowed here a court, corporation, or college, of six Pre bends, or Canons Augustine, as council or assistants to the Bishop, Dean, or Rector, viz. the Lord of the Barton of Trearike, now Peter's, and two others, who alternately are patrons of this church, and present the rector thereto."], [425, "ST.

Roscarrake, in this parish, gave name and residence to the old and famous family of gentlemen, from thence deno minated De Roscarrake. Richard de Roscarrack held in this place the fourth part of a knight's fee in the reign of Henry the Fourth, as appears from Carew's Survey. John Roscarrack was Sheriff of Cornwall in the 6th Henry VII. Richard Roscarrack was Sheriff in 4th Ed ward VI. again 2d Elizabeth. And John Roscarrack was Sheriff 17th Elizabeth. They received great augmentation to their estate by the daughter and heir of Pentire of Pentuan, who brought to them the whole patrimony of that family: but, alas! so true is that saying, \" Man doth not always flourish,\" the great estate of this family, by ill conduct, was much wasted ; and in the reign of Charles the Second, this very barton and manor of Roscarrack was sold by Charles Roscarrack to Edward Boscowen, Esq. in whose son and heir, Mr. Hugh Boscowen, of Tregothen, it now resteth. Trefreke now belongs to Mr. John Hemley, who giveth for his arms, Argent, three hounds passant Azure. THE EDITOR. Port Isaac, a small town of the sea coast, with a harbour for boats and sloops, is situated in this parish. The church, standing on a high hill, is a landmark from the Bristol Channel.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. St. Enedellyan has been long celebrated for its mines of antimony. This metal occurs in the state of a sulphuret, associated with iron pyrites, in quartz veins, which run east and west, traversing a blue lamellar slate, very similar to that which frequently abounds in the calcareous series, and to which, indeed, this slate belongs. Some curious varie ties of rocks in this series are found in St. Enedellyan, one of which, in particular, abounds between the church and Port Isaac, which was noticed by Sir Humphrey Davy in a decomposing state, under the name of mandelstone. In this state it is a dull earthy argillaceous rock, of an ochre ous colour, full of small, roundish cavities. In its perfect state this rock is a greenish-grey, glossy, compact felspar, containing granules of flesh-coloured calcareous spar, and minute prisms of hornblende. During decomposition, the calcareous spar is dissolved, and washed away by the rain water, which produces the honeycomb appearance; and the ferruginous stain is derived from the iron contained in the hornblende. This rock has been described by Mr. Prideaux as occurring in Devon. It is very rare in Corn wall. 2 c"], [428, "386 ST. ENODOR HALS.

Some of the inhabitants of this parish have told me that one St. Athenodorus is the tutelar guardian of this church, from whom it is denominated Enador. Athenodorus, the stoic philosopher of Athens, was born before Christ Jesus, and was tutor to the Emperor Augustus, who taught him that he should neither do or say any thing, but take respite till he could say over the Greek alphabet, that so he might neither say or do any thing through rashness or anger; for which advice he is specially remembered. Car-vin-ike, alias Car-fyn-ike, (i. e. the rock spring, fountain, leat, or riveret of water, so called from the natu ral circumstances ofthe place,) is the dwelling of Anthony Tanner, Gent, that married Carthew; his father Arundell,"], [429, "387 ST. ENODOR. r by whom he had this place. Originally descended from the Tanners, late of Court and Boderick, in St. Stephen's, and giveth the same arms. Pen-coll, or Pen-cooth, in this parish, (i. e. the head wood, a name also of old taken from the ancient natural circumstances ofthe place,) is the dwelling of Arthur For tescue, Gent, that married Verman ; his father El ford, being of the Fortescues of Filleigh, in Devon, and gives the same arms. Gon-rounsan, in this parish, is the dwelling of John Flammock, Gent, that married Coode, and giveth for his arms the same as the Flammocks of Bodmin. This land is since sold to Philip Hawkins, Esq. son of Mr. Hawkins of Creed. Tre-wheler, in this parish, is the dwelling of Edward Hoblyn, Gent, that married Williams; his father Coso warth; a younger branch of Nanswhiddon family, and giveth the same arms. This parish of St. Enedor is the flattest or levellest pa rish of lands in Cornwall, and, by consequence, the store house or preserver of moisture, or water ; and in testimony of the wateryness of this soil, I do remember that in the latter end of the reign of King Charles the Second, the tower of this church sunk in its foundation, so much that the whole fabric fell to the ground, and greatly damnified the church with its stones; which church and tower, by the Bishop of Exeter's grant of a collection throughout his diocese, are both again well-built and repaired as it now stands. This parish is enriched with lodes of tin and copper. At Pen-hale, or haile, in this parish, that is to say, the head-river, or the head of the river; and suitable to its name, in the low lands thereof are the original fountains or springs of two notable rivers, viz. that on the south side of those lands, making its current or flux to Tresillian Bridge, in Merther, on the south part of this county ; that on the north side of Penhale lands, making its course to Lower 2 c 2"], [430, "388 ST. ENODOR. St. Colomb Port, on the north part of Cornwall; both which rivers abound with fishes proper to the country in their seasons, as trouts, eels, peal, and salmon, &c. before they empty themselves into the North and South Seas of the British Channel, and the Irish or Atlantic Ocean. TONKIN. I have to remark on this parish, that all the southern part is in the hundred of Powder, although it is wholly rated to that of Pidar. Athenodorus, to whom this church is dedicated, is a saint in the Roman Calendar, and brother to Gregory Thau niaturgus, or the miracle-worker, both natives of Neoc\u00e6se rea, in Pontus, or Cappadocia; of noble extraction, very well skilled in the sciences, the knowledge of tongues, and philosophy; who, hearing of the great fame of Origen, came to hear him, and were by his learned lessons, and holy exhortations, brought to leave the Pagan philosophy and all mundane sciences, and to embrace the holy the ology, in which they made so great a progress in the space of five years, under so good a master, that, although they were both very young, they were honoured with the office of Bishops in the churches of Pontus. This St. Atheno dorus suffered martyrdom about the year 272, under Aurelian. THE EDITOR, In this parish are situated three villages, called Summer court, Penhale, and Fraddon, each of which had formerly the privilege of holding an annual fair. All are now trans ferred to Somercourt. One held on the 25th of September, is considered to be the most important in Cornwall. The name is obviously modern, although the village itself seems to be quite as ancient as any in the neighbourhood. There is in this parish also another village, of consider able importance up to the year 1832, called Michell, St. Michael, or Modeshole."], [431, "389 ST. ENODOR. This place, although never entitled, by the utmost stretch of courtesy, to the appellation of a town, was privi leged with sending Members to Parliament in the time of King Edward the Sixth, probably to increase the political power of the Lords Arundell, who then possessed the para mount manor of Michel, together with an unrivalled influ ence in that part of Cornwall. ManyT of the small places in Cornwall received this pri vilege from the Tudors, for the express purpose of be coming close or nomination boroughs, withdrawn as they then were from public view or attention. The system thus created has acted at different periods in various ways. At first, many of the small Boroughs returned neighbouring gentlemen to Parliament, the natural aristo cracy of the country, and practically the peers of other gentlemen holding hereditary seats, and distinguished by the shadowy appellation of offices long since extinct. These representatives formed the strongest bulwark of national liberty in the subsequent reigns of the Stuarts. So that Charles the Second, and his brother King James, en deavoured to smooth the way for their progress towards despotism by invading chartered or prescriptive rights ; and thus the inviolability of these rights became associated in men's minds, after the Revolution, with the very idea of liberty itself; and this union remained so permanently fixed and strong at the distance of a century, as to dash in pieces the otherwise powerful administration of Mr. Fox and Lord North, because they proposed to interfere autho ritatively with the Charter of the East India Company. Times were, however, at that period completely changed. The English Empire had extended itself into all parts of the globe; an immense manufacturing and commercial interest had grown up ; and, of still greater consequence, the na tional debt had created a vast monied capital, not subject to the laws of primogeniture, and therefore inclined to wards democracy. All these obtained representatives through the small Boroughs, but tempered in most cases"], [432, "390 ST. ENODOR. by the media through which the seats were acquired. Statesmen by profession, and many inclined to support the existing order of things by their situation in life, and by their connection, obtained admission also into Parliament in the same manner, and all these, united with the represen tatives of counties, and of large towns, formed an assembly, owing its existence, no doubt, to accidental causes, but, in the opinion of many wise and experienced men, better adapted to the government of a great country than any one that the world had seen, or than could be established by systematic arrangements. That House of Commons has been swept away by the enactment of 1832; and it remains to be proved by an ex periment, at which bold men might shrink, whether a more direct delegation will as effectually represent all the varied materials of the State, and whether a body so powerful may not ultimately absorb into its immediate superintend ence the whole legislative and executive functions. Michell had to boast among its representatives of Sir Walter Ralegh, of Mr. Carew, the historian of Cornwall, and of many distinguished gentlemen of the county. It used to be said, that Colonel Give spent so much money in a contest for this place as to occasion his return to India, where he gained the batde of Plassey, and established the Eastern Empire. The right of election seems to have been vague and un defined at Michell, as it was in early times at almost all other places ; but repeated decisions of the Llouse of Com mons tended to ascertain, and usually to abridge the right, as this was deemed most favourable to the new Govern ment; and finally, by Act of Parliament in 2d George II. the last decision of the House of Commons on any right of voting acquired the force and authority of law. Such a decision took place with respect to Michell in the year 1700, fixing the right of voting in the possessors of five burgage tenures, here denominated mesne lordships, and in all resident payers of scot and lot. Property"], [433, "391 ST. ENODOR. within, the limits of the borough being divided, and each possessor of land wishing to multiply voters, they were raised to the amount of sixty or eighty, till at last the whole property coming into the hands of two Cornish gen tlemen, they, in promotion of a system which may yet be regretted, consolidated the land, let the better houses on conditions, such as to prevent the occupiers from appearing on the parish rates, and converted to farm shelters, or took down, hovels that were originally constructed for election purposes. Contests were thus avoided, and the borough rendered close ; the two proprietors having mutu ally pledged themselves in writing to support each other in their equal shares. One of the proprietors died, and his son continued to act on the agreement. The other proprietor also died; and his brother having verbally ratified the compact, con tinued also to act on it, and a joint return was made in 1830. But a total change of men and measures having taken place in the administration of Government, the Re form Bill was introduced, and so powerful is the action of party feelings on the most honourable minds, heightened as they were, on this important occasion, by an honest con viction generally entertained on all sides, of the real and permanent welfare of the country being involved, that one of the proprietors thought himself absolved from adhering to the contract, unless his associate would take the same line of politics on this great subject as himself. A poll was thereupon called for, and the numbers were, for Kenyon five, for Best three, and Hawkins two; one voter having been got over by the infringing party. Pencoose is now the property of Mr. William Basset, having been purchased from the Fortescues. Trewhele belongs to Mr. John Basset, of this parish. Treweere is held in joint tenantry by Mr. Retollock, son of Mr. Retollock who resided at Michell as agent for the borough, and Sir Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. This place is considered to be a barton; and it must"], [434, "392 ST. ENODOR. formerly have been the residence of some gentleman, although the place is now reduced to a common farm. Gomronson, heretofore the property of the Flammocks, now belongs to Hawkins. Boswallow was purchased by Mr. John Stephens, of St. Ives, about the middle of the last century, and now belongs to his grandson, Mr. Samuel Stephens, of Tregenna. The paramount manor of Michell has passed into various families, on account of its political importance. Originally Arundell's, it for some time belonged to the Scawens, an ancient race of Cornish gentlemen now extinct. One of the family held the honourable, and then gratuitous, office of Vice Warden, on the Restoration of King Charles the Second.* This manor was finally purchased by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, and belonged to his devisee at the period ofthe general dissolution of close boroughs.

St. Hermes or St. Ermes, the supposed patron saint of this parish, is said to have suffered martyrdom at Rome in the persecution raised by the Emperor Adrian, about the year 132. His tomb in the Salian Way was ornamented by Pope Pelagius the Second, who filled the chair of St. Peter from 577 to 590. The name of St. Hermes is much cele- brated in the ancient martyrologies. In the Missale Romanum is the following prayer, to be used on the 28th of August, the day consecrated to his memory : Deus, qui beatum Hermetem Mariyrem tuum virtute constanti\u00e6 in passione roborasti, ex ejus nobis imitatione"], [436, "394 ST.

Tre-gasa, alias Tre-gaza, in this parish, id est, the wood town, to prove which etymology there is still extant a con siderable wood adjoining to the town place thereof, was the dwelling of Thomas Coke, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall 27 Charles I. that married Lance, his father Herle. His grand father John Coke, Gent, attorney at law, of Trerice, in St. Allen, who first came into those parts temp. Elizabeth, from St. Mary Ottery, in Devon, without money or goods, placed himself a servant or steward under Sir Francis Godolphin, Knight, where he began from, and with his inkhorn and pen, to turn all things that he touched into gold (as King Gyges), and that by indirect arts and prac tices as tradition saith ; for that Sir Francis taking a great liking to him, left the management of his estate and great tin works to him, his said steward Coke. He accordingly took care that all such tin of his master's as was melted at the blowing-house into slabs or blocks, was justly marked with the dolphin stamp, as is customarily done on those gentlemen's tin to this day. After some years, Mr. Coke remaining in service as aforesaid, by his subtle arts and con trivances, out of Sir Francis' toll, and the shares of other adventurers, and the wages of labouring tinners, he pro duced considerable quantities of his own block tin, which, when melted at the blowing-house, as aforesaid, to distin guish it from his master's, he marked thereon the figure of a cat ; the same, it seems, being the coat armour of his fa mily or ancestors. At length, against coinage time there was more tin brought by Mr. Coke to be coined at the coin age towns, marked with the cat, than there was of his mas ter's marked with the dolphin. Whereupon, Sir Francis's Lady being informed of his ill practices, and resolving by the next coinage to be better instructed in this mystery, at such time as Godolphin blowing-house was at work, privately, with one of her"], [437, "395 ST. EARME. maids, in a morning, on foot, went to that place, where ac- cording, as common fame reported, she found many more blocks or slabs of tin marked with the cat than there were with the dolphin ; the one part pertaining to Sir Francis, the other to Mr. Coke. Whereupon, abundantly satisfied, the returned to Godolphin House, but could not be there timely enough against dinner ; whereat Sir Fn ncis was greatly distasted, having at that time several strangers to dine with him. At length the lady being arrived, she asked all their pardons for her absence, and told them it did not proceed from any neglect or want of respect, but from an absolute necessity of seeing a strange and unheard- of piece of curiosity, which could not be seen at any other time; viz. to see the cat eat the dolphin (indeed cats are great lovers of fish elsewhere as experience shews) and then gave an account ofthe premises, to their great wonder and admiration : whereupon, soon after, Sir Francis dismissed him from his service. But by that time he had gotten so much riches, that forthwith he purchased the little barton and manor of Trerice, in St. Allen, and made that place his habitation till he purchased this barton and manor of Tregasa, and seated himself here ; where, by parsimony and the inferior practice of the law, he accumulated a very considerable estate in those parts. But, maugre all his thrift and conduct in providing wealth for himself and pos- terity, his grandson Thomas Coke, aforesaid, succeeding to his estate, upon the issueless decease of his elder brother Christopher Coke, and buying in his widow's jointure at a dear rate, and also undertaking the building of the present new and finely-contrived house at Tregasa, though never finished, yet the said fabric was so costly and chargeable to him, together with the vain extravagance of his wife (Lance), that he was necessitated to sell divers parcels of lands, in order to raise money for his necessary occasions ; and finally to mortgage this manor and barton of Tregasa, and all his other lands that were before unsold, for about fourteen thousand pounds, to Hugh Boscawen, of Tregoth-"], [438, "396 ST. EARME. nan, Esq. and lastly, for that consideration and others, did, by lease and release, fine and proclamation, convey the same to the said Hugh Boscawen, his heirs and assigns, forever, who are now in possession thereof. Soon after this fact Mr. Coke fell into great want and distress, together with his wife and children, and died suddenly by a slip of his foot into a shallow pit, wherein he was searching for tin, out of a conceited opinion he had that he should at last raise his fortunes by tin, as his grandfather before him had done. The arms of Coke are, in a field Argent, upon a bend cotised Sable, three cats Or, with a crescent for distinction of a second house. Truth-an, in this parish, parcel of Cargoll manor, held of the Bishop of Exeter, (that is to say, the trath or trudh-an, id est, the trout fish,) is the dwelling of John Williams, Esq.

The arms of Jago are As for the name Jago, whether it be derived from the Celtish, British, Jago, and signifies James, or from Gago, or Jago, a spear, or military tuck, I determine not, or from gages and pledges for battle ; however, this name was of an cient use in Britain; for Galfridus Monmouthensis tells us of a king named Jago, before Julius C\u00e6sar landed in Bri tain, that reigned twenty-five years, and lies buried at York. Trehane, in this parish, i. e. old or ancient town, is the dwelling of William Courtney, Gent, a younger branch of Trethurfe family, that married Seawen, his father Treva nion, of Tregarthyn, and giveth the same arms as the Tre thyrie Courtneys do. TONKIN. A part of this parish is within the manor of Cargaul, be longing to the Bishop of Exeter, but long held by the Bor lases, of Treladra, on a lease for lives, and under them by the Jagos, a family of antient standing in this parish. During the Civil Wars and the subsequent usurpation, John Jago, of this parish, Esq. was a Justice of the Peace, and a mighty sequestrator, so that he got into his possession the greater part of Mr. Borlase's estate, and drove his fa mily to great extremities. Mr. Jago died before the Re storation, leaving one son by his first wife, a daughter of John Molesworth, Esq. of Pencorrow ; and three daughters by his second wife, a daughter of Herle, of Prideaux,"], [440, "398 ST. EARME. Esq. and widow of Williams, of Truthon. His three daughters were married to three Clergymen, to Mr. Charles Tremayne, Vicar of St. Austell ; to Mr. Carthew, Vicar of St. Erme: and to Mr. Drinkwater, Vicar of Mevagissey. His son John Jago enjoyed this and the rest of his father's estate till the Restoration ; when Mr. Borlase got his own again, and among the rest this barton, the lease under him having expired by the death of Mr. John Jago, sen. Mr. Borlase settled Truthon on his son Humphry Borlase on marriage with a daughter of Sir John Winter, of Sydney, in Gloucestershire, Bart, maid of honour to Queen Hen rietta Maria, but had not any children that survived their infancy, except one son, Nicholas Borlase, who was taken off in the flower of his youth. Mr. Borlase built here a very convenient new house, and made it the place of his constant residence; but Mr. Borlase being deeply engaged in the interest of the late King James, and Sheriff during the two last years of his reign, sold his copyhold lease of Truthon to the before-mentioned Mr. Williams, who was Sheriff of Cornwall, in the 4th year of Queen Anne, 1705. He left four sons and three daughters. His eldest son John sSD Williams, Esq. now lives here in the commission of the peace, and as yet unmarried. The manor of Killigrew, which signifies the Eagle's Grove, from Kelly, a Grove, and Eriew or Erigrew, an Eagle, gave name to that ancient and very eminent family of Kelligrew, whose seat it was for a long time ; till on their marriage with the heiress of Arwinick, they removed thither, as being the more pleasant and convenient seat. This place, however, continued in their possession till the reign of King James the First, when Sir John Kelligrew first mortgaged it to his kinsman Mitchell, of Truro, and after that dismembered and sold it in parcels. The barton and va rious high rents were purchased by the said Mitchell, who sold them again about the year 1636, to the before men tioned Mr. Jago, of Truthan, who left the barton to his son John Jago, who on the recovery of Truthon, by Mr. Bor-"], [441, "399 ST.

Ennis or de Insula, which explains the meaning of the word, was formerly the seat of the Opies, for here resided, in Queen Elizabeth's time, John Opie, sen. whose son Ro bert Opie, married Jane, the daughter of Agnes Jago, of this parish, widow, and the said Robert or his son sold the barton to John Jago. These Opies I take to be a younger branch of the Opies of Towton, who give for their arms, Sable, on a chevron, between three garbs Or, as many hurtleberries Proper. The above named John Jago married, in 1664, Juliana, the second daughter of Thomas Tonkin, of Trevawnance, by whom he had several children; he survived her, and dying in the early part of this century (i. e. 1700) left the two bartons of Killigrew and Ennis to his eldest son Itai Jagoe, who married the daughter of John Bowden, of Tre lassick, in the parish of Ladock, who is still living, but has sold the manor or manors to Robert Corker, of Falmouth, Esq. lately deceased, reserving to himself the barton of Ennis, and a part of the barton of Killigrew on lease. The arms of Jagoe are, Argent, a plough Proper, between three fleurs-de-lis Azure (Mr. Lysons says, Or, a chevron be tween three cross crosslets Sable.) Mr. Itai Jagoe has since sold the fee of Ennis to John Stephens of St. Ives, Gent, reserving to himself the lease for three lives; which Mr. Stephens, has this March, 1737, bought also the manor of Killigrew of Sir J. Molesworth and Edmund Prideaux, Esq. Polglase is not far from Killigrew, and was anciently a part of that manor. It signifies the green pool, and was sold by the above-named Sir John Killigrew to John Lux ton, Gent, inter alia, in the 8th year of King James the First, who, two years afterwards, sold it, to John Rosogan, sen. of the Rosogans of St. Stephen in Bronnel, who came to live in this place, and left it to his son John Rosogan, of Lyon's Inn, Gent.

THE EDITOR. Cornwall is indebted to this parish for introducing the very respectable family which now (1833) gives a member for the County. The advowson has belonged in succession to the families of Luttrell and Wynne. Doctor William Stackhouse is said to have acquired this living by exchange, but it ap pears to be more probable, on account of his connection with the patrons, that the presentation came immediately from them. He was the brother of the Rev. Thomas Stack house, Vicar of Benham, in Berkshire, author of the well known History ofthe Bible, first published in 1732, in two volumes folio, and of various other works. Doctor William Stackhouse resided on his living, and there married the heiress of the parish, Miss Williams, of Trehane. He had two sons, William, who married and spent his life at Trehane, and lived till June 1830, in his ninetieth year; and John, to whom Mrs. Perceval, heiress of the Pendarveses, of Pendarves, in Cambourne gave her whole estate. Mr. John Stackhouse married Miss Acton, of Ac ton Scot, pear Church Stretton, in Shropshire, and acquired with her a very extensive property, which through the libe rality of Mrs. Stackhouse (living in 1833) is possessed by"], [443, "ST. ERME. 401 hes second son, on whom the estate was settled after her de cease ; * and through a similar act of liberality on the part of his father, Mr. Edward William Stackhouse, the eldest son, had the property in Cornwall placed in his possession on his marriage with Miss Trist, an extensive heiress in De vonshire. This gentleman has moreover derived a very considerable addition to his fortune by the will of the Reverend Doctor Wynne, patron and some time Rector of this parish, and in remembrance of the family of Pendarves, and of the fa mily of Wynne, to both of which he is related, and from both of which he has obtained ample possessions, Mr. Stack house has exchanged his original name for those of Wynne Pendarves, under which he now represents the County in Parliament.

The manor of Pelsew, or Peldu, in this parish, is said by Mr. Lysons to have belonged to Robert Earl of Corn wall at the period of the Domesday Survey; that it was forfeited by John Vere, Earl of Oxford, to Edward the Fourth, in 1471; and that it passed through the families of Mapowder and Luttrell to Doctor Wynne, conveying with it the advowson ofthe church. Dr. Wynne held the rectory for many years on his own presentation, deputing the care of his parish to the very eminent scholar and pre ceptor Dr. Cardew ; but when residence became necessary for all incumbents, under the provisions of an act of par liament, he bestowed the living on the distinguished indi vidual who had long been his curate. Dr. Cardew de parted from this life in December 1831, having advanced into his 84th year.

Truthen, with the whole manor of Corgol, was acquired by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins from the See of Exe ter in 1805, under the act of Parliament for redeeming land tax, and since his decease Mr. Collins has purchased the freehold of Truthen, and resides there. The manor of Killigrew, purchased by Mr. John Ste phens, of St. Ives, descended to his only surviving son, Mr. Samuel Stephens, Member for St. Ives, about the year 1750, who built the house at Tregenna ; and it has passed from him, by will, to his second son, the late Samuel Stephens, Esq. who also represented St. Ives, and who re sided in the house at Tregenna, which his father built.

In this town they had their domestic chapel and burying place, now totally gone to decay, since those Arundels re moved from hence to Lanherne. This manor was anciently held of the manor of Payton, by the tenure of knight's ser vice. And here John de Arundel held a knight's fee (Morton, 3d Henry IV.) as I am informed. In digging up the grounds of this old chapel and burial-place not long since, was found an urn, wherein were contained certain pieces of bones, ashes, and coals.

But, when all that is said or done in this matter, St. Tne may be a corruption of St. Hugh, the tutelar guardian and patron of this church's name ; who, in all probability, was either St. Hugh, the twenty-sixth Bishop of Lincoln, 1186, who died 1203, or St. Hugh who was also born and lived at Lincoln, as Copgrave out of Matthew Paris in- forms us ; who was stolen from his parents at nine years old by the barbarous and bloody Jews (first brought and tolerated in England by William the Conqueror), who, in derision of Christ and Christianity, in a private place, was by them inhumanly crucified, the 7th of July, 1255. Nevertheless, this fact was not so secretly performed but that at length it came to the magistrates' ears, who there- upon apprehended the malefactors, and so ordered their indictment that severe justice was done upon all those offenders, that could be discovered to have had a hand in shedding the blood of this innocent youth. But, alas ! this punishment of part of them did neither fully content or satisfy the prince or people at that time ; for soon after King Henry the Third, by proclamation, set out all Jews in his dominions at a certain rent to such as would poll and rifle them, and amongst others to his brother Richard King of the Romans; who, after he had plundered their estates, committed their bodies as his slaves, to labour in his tin-mines of Cornwall ; the memory of whose workings is still preserved in the names of several tin-works, called Towle Sarasin, and corruptly Attall Saracen, i. e. the refuse or outcast of the Saracens; that is to say, of those Jews descended from Sarah and Abraham. Other works were called Whele Etherson, the Jews' Works, or Unbe lievers' Works, in Cornish.

Lastly, Copgrave further assures us, who lived tempore Edward the Fourth, that at the shrine of this St. Hugh at Lincoln, divers supernatural facts or miracles were done; for which reason he was put into the Catalogue of Roman Saints.

In this parish is the barton and manor of Lan-hadarn, alias Lanhaddarne, alias Lanhadden, alias Lansladarne, the thieves' or robbers' place.

Member of Parliament for St. Mawes, that married Jones, of Wales, as I take it, but died without issue by a fall from his coachbox ; and also two daughters, the eldest married to John Nicholls, of Tre wane, Esq. the other to Francis Scobell, Esq. Member of Parliament for Mitchell, now in possession of this lordship, and all other Sir Joseph's lands, greatly encumbered with debts. Hal-liggon, in this parish, is the dwelling of Sir John Tremayne, Knight, serjeant-at-law, who married, but died without issue. His father, Colonel Lewis Tremayne, mar ried Carew, of Penwarne, by whom also he had issue Tremayne, Clerk, Vicar of St. Austell, whose son by Jagoe, Tremayne, Esq. is now in possession of this barton and manor, who married Clotworthy's heir. Origi nally this family was descended from the Tremaynes of Collacomb, in Devon (for which see Mabe). Tre-vethick, alias Trevithick, in this parish, i. e. the farmer, rustic, or husbandman's town, is the dwelling of John Hickes, Esq. Commissioner for the Peace and Taxes, and sometime Member of Parliament for Fowey, who married ; his father an attorney-at-law. This gentleman's father came to an untimely death by means of an unskilful nurse that attended him in his sick ness, who being prescribed a medicine by the physician, wherein was to be compounded, amongst others, (the herb) mercury, which the woman not understanding, bought of the apothecary the poisonous drug mercury, or crocus me"], [459, "417 ST.

In like manner a son of his, named Stephen Hickes, a youth of about eighteen years of age, at school with Mr. Halsey at Merther, carrying about a birding-gun chargea with powder and shot in his hand, the gun accidentally went off at such time as the mouth thereof was opposite to his body, which shot him dead through the breast and heart, to the grief of all that knew him. Tre-luick, alias Tre-luige, in this parish, signifies the lake or river of water town, or the town whose lands are situate upon some river or bosom of waters, is the dwelling of John Archer, Gent, that married Addis ; his father Archer, Clerk, Vicar of Manaccan, married Sweet. This I take to be that place taxed in the Domesday Book, 1087, as the voke lands of some manor, by the name of Treluwe, or else Treluick, in St. Allen parish. TONKIN. This parish is dedicated to St. Eva or Ewe, not from our grandmother Eve. It is a rectory, and in the gift of Sir John St. Aubyn and Dr. John Hawkins, from the Tredinhams. Various manors are situated in this parish. Pelrew, i. e. the black park, includes two bartons, distinguished by the names of Trevelisick Wartha and Trevalisick Wallas, that is, the higher and lower, and belong to William Seccombe, Gent, who gives for his arms, Argent, a fess Gules between three lions rampant Sable. Adjoining to these lands is Trelisick ; for the meaning of which see St. Erth, a part of the said manor, but the property of Mr. Tremayne. The manor of Precays. This being part of the posses sions of Sir Henry Bodrigan, was on his attainder inter alia given by Henry the Seventh to Sir Richard Edge cumbe, Comptroller of his household, in whose posterity it vol. i. 2 e"], [460, "418 ST. EWE. now continues; the Hon. Richard Edgecumbe being the present lord of this manor. To speak now of the most noted places, the first we come to, and which joins with Trelisick in Tregonan, that is, the town on the downs, formerly the property ofthe Tredenhams; but on the death of John Tredenham, Esq. at Westminster, December the 25th, 1710, a gentle man of very bright parts and of great loyalty, which he often shewed in Parliament, this barton came to his second sister, Mary, the wife of Francis Scobell, esq. who makes this place his residence. Next the manor of Treworick, that is, the town on the river, called in Domesday Book Treworoc, was one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton. This was also a part of the property forfeited by Sir Henry Bodrigan, and given to Sir Richard Edge cumbe. The manor of St. Ewe or Eva, so called from the name of the parish. The church and glebe being taken out of it, and the advowson being still appurtenant, was anciently the inheritance ofthe family of Coleshul. Sir John Coles hill, slain at the battle of Agincourt, left a son of the same name, Sir John Coleshul, Sheriff of Cornwall the 17th Henry VI. and the 7th Edward IV. who dying without issue his sister Joan, married to Sir Remfry Arundel, be came his heir. Sir John St. Aubyn possesses one fifth and one six tieth;, or thirteen sixtieths of this property ; the remaining parts came through different hands at last to Sir John Tre denham of Tregoran, and were sold, with the greatest part of the Tredenham estates, to Francis Scobell, Esq. in 1727 ; so that John Hawkins, of Pennem**, D. D. and Sir John St. Aubyn, are the actual proprietors. Not far from the church, as the name signifies, a tene ment called Lanewa, lately the seat, under the said lords, of George Slade, Gent, till he removed to Trevisick, in St. Austell."], [461, "419 ST. EWE. The manor of Heligon was anciently the inheritance of the Whitleighs, of Efford, in Devonshire. Richard Whit leigh, Esq. had two daughters and heirs, Joanna, married to Richard Hals, of Kenedon, in Devonshire, Esq. and Margaret to Roger Granville, Esq. of Stow, between whom this and many more manors were divided. Roger and Margaret Granville gave their part of this manor to their third son, Degorie Granville, of Penheale, Esq. and in the 28th year of Henry the Eighth John Hals, of Efford, and his son Richard Hals, sold their half of the manor to Sampson Tremayne, senior, of St. Ewe : and, on the 8th of May, in the 10th year of Queen Elizabeth, Richard Granville, of Penhele, sold the other half to the said Samp son Tremayne, and the whole is now enjoyed by his de scendant John Tremayne, who married in 1735 Grace, the youngest daughter, and in a manner sole heiress, of Henry Hawkins, of St. Austel, attorney-at-law. Sir John Tremayne, serjeant-at-law, built the present house, in addition to some rooms of an old house in the same place. Those places, called Kestell, that is, castle, belong to the manor. Kestell Wartha, the Middle Castle, and Kestel Wallas, but why so named I cannot learn, there not being the least remains of any fortification. Kes tell Wartha, or the higher castle, was for a time the resi dence of Lewis Tremayne, Esq. during the life of his father. This gentleman, great-grandfather of Mr. John Tremayne, the present possessor, was then a lieutenant colonel under King Charles the First, and a very stout honest man. The manor of Coran is now become a part of the manor of Pentnar, in Mevassary, the lord of which is the Hon- John Roberts. Lanhedrar, the seat of thieves, belonged to Robert Earl of Morton. Serlo de Lanhedrar, of this place, had sum mons as a Baron, and also to attend the King beyond the seas, 2.5th Edward the First. Lower Lanhedrar was the seat by lease under the Arun-"], [462, "420 ST. EWE. dels, of Thomas Maunder, Gent, who left three daughters his coheirs : Mary married to Henwood, Priscilla to John Wolridge, of Gorminick, the third to John Williams, who lived at Tregenna. To the northward of Lanhedrar, is Trelean, memorable, or rather infamous, for having been the birthplace of that trumpeter of rebellion Hugh Peters, as the late Mr. Lewis Tremayne has often assured me. Next to this is Rosecorla, that is, the valley of the sheep fold, lately the seat, in lease too from the Arundels, of Edward Maunder, Gent. Next is Trelewick. This seems to have been anciently a manor of itself, although long since disfranchised. It is now the seat of William Archer, a minor. His father, John Archer, Esq. married Adis, of Plymouth. The arms of Archer are, Sable, a chevron engrailed between three sheens (i. e. spear-heads) Or. The manor of Tregian gave name to the noted family of Tregian, and was their chief seat till they removed to Gol den in Probus, when the ancient seat fell into decay, so that no traces are now left. This, with the rest of Mr. Tregian's great estate, was forfeited, as will be stated under Probus. Pensiquillis, the head ofthe dry copes, or the dry hill of wood, was the last seat of the Penkevills, in this county ; where they retired after they had sold off the greatest of their considerable estates therein. The last heir-male of this ancient family, Benjamin Penkivill, Esq. died here un married, of the smallpox, the 21st of November, 1699, leaving his six sisters co-heirs. To the north of this place is Lithony, commonly Luny, and is the modern seat of the Mohuns. Wrarwick Mohun, Esq. on his marriage with , daughter of Adis, Esq. built a house here in his father's lifetime, where he resided till his death, which happened on the road to Lon don in October 1736. To the south is Borew, the bleak dwelling, but why so"], [463, "421 ST. EWE called I cannot guess. This was formerly the seat of Cruffs, on lease from the Arundels. And next to that is Tregenno, the town of the mouth or entrance, as I believe from the situation of its chief place just by the downs. This manor was for several generations the seat, on lease under the Arundels, of the family of Robins ; the last of which, Stephen Robins, resided for the most part in St. Winnow. It has since been the dwelling of Richard Randyl, Gent, whose arms are, Gules, on a cross Argent, three mullets pierced Sable. Further south lies Levalra, where lived Hugh Henwood, Gent.; but, on his decease in 1733, the place was sold. To the north of Tregenno is the manor of Penstruan, that is, the head of the springs. This was a part of Sir Henry Rodrigan's forfeited estate, and came by grant to the Edgecumbes. I now come to the church of St. Ewe, which consists cf a nave, a south aile, a vestry to the north, and a cross aile, At the western end is a square tower, with a steeple on the top, in which are three bells. Some of the windows have painted glass; in one, an angel holds in his hands an escutcheon, charged, Azure, on a fess Sable, three chevro nels sideways of the Field. The church plate is very hand some. On the flaggon is inscribed : Jacobus Robins, de Tregennoe, Arm. nuper expirans ex voto legavit. On the cover : St Ewe. On the cup : Eis 'Etvy^apiaTav. In the north-west corner of the churchyard is a rough altar tomb, without an inscription visible at present, but tradition says it had formerly the following : Here lies Parson Hugh, The famous Atwell, Rector of St. Ewe. The church is built low, and at one end of the parish."], [464, "422 ST. EWE It had formerly but a low wooden cover for two bells ; but the parishioners have taken that down, and are this present year, 1732, erecting a handsome square tower, at their own sole charge, wherein they design to have a ring of three bells. In the nave, against the wall, is a small monument with this inscription : M'\u00e6 S\". Roberti Quarme, Genosi, ob. ximo Ap. anno Dom' m.dccviii. \u00e6tatis su\u00e6 l.'.xii.

St. Ewe has to lament the loss of all the gentlemen's families, with the exception of one, [which are stated to have resided there in former times ; but that one may well compensate for the absence of all the others. Mr. John Tremayne, who married Grace, the youngest * Acts of the Apostles, eh. xviii. v. 21."], [465, "ST. EWE. 423 daughter of Mr. Henry Hawkins, of St. Austell, had two sons, and a daughter married to Mr. Charles Rash leigh, of Desporth, as has been noticed under St. Austel. The eldest son, Lewis, died in the prime of life, when the second son, who had taken orders, became the heir of his family. The Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne married Harriet, daughter and coheir of John Hearle, Esq. of Penryn, and of her mother heiress of the Paynters of St. Erth. They have left an only son, John Hearle Tremayne, married to Caroline, daughter of the late Sir William Lemon. It is impossible to say too much in praise of the late Mr. Henry Hawkins Tremayne : possessed of good abilities, of a sound understanding, of practical knowledge of busi ness, and of the utmost kindness of heart, he became the father of his neighbourhood, reconciling all disputes, ad justing all differences, and tempering the administration of justice with lenity and forbearance. So high and so exten sive was the reputation of Mr. Tremayne throughout the whole county, that his son, buoyant on the father's virtues, and before opportunities were afforded for displaying his own, passed by an unanimous election into the high station of representative for Cornwall ; but experience soon proved that Mr. John Hearle Tremayne wanted no assist ance from hereditary claims to make him worthy of that, or of any other distinction. And the Editor takes this oppor tunity of repeating what he had the honour of addressing to a county meeting, previously to Mr. Tremayne's decla ration of not allowing himself to be elected for the sixth time, to avoid the embroilment of a contest : \" I have had the happiness of witnessing Mr. Tremayne's conduct in Parliament for twenty years ; and knowing the high estimation in which he is held by all parties, and by all sides of the House of Commons, I venture to assert that Cornwall would fall in public opinion if Mr. Tremayne were not again returned, let his successor be who he may.\" The parish of St. Ewe measures 5,085 statute acres."], [466, "424 ST.

Dr. Boase observes on tbe geology of this parish, that it has the same geological structure as the contiguous parishes of Creed and Cornelly. On the parish of Cornelly Dr. Boase states that the prevailing rock is a fissile blue slate ; that it probably con tains beds of massive lamellar rocks ; and that all belong to the calcareous series. P. S. It should have, been noticed that the late Mr. Tremayne greatly improved the house built at Heligon by Serjeant Tremayne ; that his son has carried the im provements still further, and rendered the whole place one of the finest in Cornwall.

Is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the north Budock ; east, the haven or harbour of Falmouth ; south, the Black Rock and Pendennis Castle; west, Bud ock, and the British Channel. For the name, it is taken from the Vale river's mouth, which here empties itself into the British Ocean. And the river itself takes its name from its original fountain in Roach, under Haynes-burrow, called Pen-ta-Vale, Fenton, or Venton ; that is to say, the head or chief, good or consecrated, spring or well of water, or river Valley, from thence called the Vale river. This place, in Cornish, is called Val-genow, or Fal-genne; in Saxon, Val-mune ; in English, Vale-mouth, synonymous therewith. This harbour of Falmouth, as mariners tell us, is in all respects the largest and safest haven for ships that this Island of Britain affordeth. Its mouth or entrance from the British Ocean, between the Castles of St. Mawes and Pendennis, situate in St. Anthony and Falmouth parishes, is about a mile and a half distant, the centre or middle thereof above a league, from the said mouth or entrance up the Vale river, by the Rock Island aforesaid, to Car ike Road, King's Road, and Turner's Wear, south-east about two leagues from thence, still on the Vale river, a VOL.

[See Cuby.] And it is overlooked on the south-east side, by St. Anthony, St. Just, Philley, Ruan Langhorne, and Cuby parishes. Within the said parishes of St. Just and St. Anthony are also two navigable creeks or channels. Near the castle and incorporate town of St. Mawes, (where formerly stood a monastery of Black Canons Augustine, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, called St. Mary de Vale, for that it was situ- ated on the Vale harbour or river, as its superior monas- tery is from the Plym river, in Devon, called St. Mary de Plym, whereon it is situate,) from the north-west part of this harbour of Falmouth, between the parishes of Budock, Gluvias, and Milor, another navigable channel extendeth itself up the country to the incorporate town of Penryn. And towards the north another channel or arm thereof, higher up, extendeth itself through the country from the centre about a league, and is navigable to Peran Well and Carnan Bridge. Further up, north-east, another arm or channel of Falmouth Harbour extends itself to the incor- porate and coinage town of Truro, and the manor of Moris, and is navigable there about nine miles dis- tance from the Black Rock, or island aforesaid. Lastly, another branch of this harbour extendeth itself to Tresilian Bridge, where it is navigable between the parishes of St. Erme, Probus, and Merther, about ten miles from the mouth of the haven, all which members or branches of the harbour of Falmouth are overlooked with lofty and plea- sant hills and vales of land, and within the memory of man abounding with flourishing woods and groves of timber; and before that time Leland the antiquary, in his Itinerary, tells us that this river Vale in his days was encompassed about with the loftiest woods, oaks, and timber-trees that this kingdom afforded temp. Henry VII. and therefore was by the Britons called Cassi-ter, or Casse-ter, viz. wood land,"], [473, "3 FALMOUTH. from which place and haven the Greeks fetching tin, called it in in their language Kaumrepos, cassiteros, stanum, and the island aforesaid the Cassiteridan Island. But, alas ! now this commodity tin hath made such havock of woods and timber-trees, in searching for and melting the same, that scarcely any of them are to be seen in those places ; for, the woods and trees being eradicated, the hills and vales afore said have submitted to agriculture, and are made arable lands, which abound with cattle, sheep, corn, and pastures. . From the premises 1 suppose it is evident what Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, saith of this harbour of Falmouth, that 100 sail of ships may lie at anchor within the same, and none of them see the others main tops, by reason of the steep hills and long windings of the. several channels thereof. In further praise whereof take these rhymes : la the calme south Valubia Harbour stands, Where Vale with Sea doth joyne its pure hands, 'Twixt whome to shipps commodious port is shevme, That makes the riches of the world its owne ; Ike-ta and Vale, the Britons' chiefest pride, Glory of them, and all the world beside, In sendinge round the riches of its tide; Greeks and Pheniciens here of old have been, Fetchinge from thence furs, hides, pure corne, and tynn, Before greate C\u00e6sar fought Cassibelynn. The parish of Falmouth is a dismembered part of the old parish of Budock, taxed in the Domesday Roll 1087, and separated from it by virtue of an Act of Parliament made 15th Charles II. whereby that church is deprived of its rectory, the great and small tithes, as far as the boun daries of this new parish extends, on the humble petition of Sir Peter Killigrew, of Arwinike, Knt. who by his own bounty, and the charitable benevolence he had begged of others (by leave of the King and Bishop of Exeter), had built on his own land a church and cemetery, at the south end of Falmouth town, whereof he was lord and high lord, for convenience of himself, his servants, and tenants, that were far off from Budock church.

Thus, it is evident by what ways and means men became patrons of churches, viz. patronum faciunt dos, \u00e6dificatio, fundus; the patrons of churches were either founders, builders, or benefactors thereof.

[according to] Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 44. Of this family further speaks Mr. Carew, p. 150. The stock is ancient, and divers of the branches have grown to great advancement in calling and livelihood by their greater deserts. Sir John Killigrew, knight, 1571, built the greatest part of the old house now standing here. He married Wolver ston of Wolverston, and had by her issue John Killigrew, Esq.; that married Monk, who had issue by her William Killigrew, Esq. created the 585th Baronet of England, patent 22d December, 12th Charles II. 1660, with limita tion to Peter Killigrew, Esq. son of Sir Peter Killigrew aforesaid, Knt. This Sir William Killigrew, Bart, by ill conduct wasted his whole paternal estate, which was valued at about 3,000^. per annum ; and lastly, sold this manor and barton of Arwinick to his younger brother, Sir Peter Killigrew, Knt. aforesaid, who had issue Sir Peter Killigrew, Bart, aforesaid, who married one of the coheirs of Judge Twysden, and had issue by her George Killigrew, Esq. that married Ann, daughter of Sir John Seyntaubyn, Bart, and had issue by her one daughter. This Mr. George Killigrew was afterwards, in a drunken humour, at a tavern in Penryn, slain in the chamber, in a duel, by Walter Vincent, Esq. barrister-at-law, who was tried for his life at Launceston for the fact, and ac quitted by the petty jury, through bribery and indirect acts and practices, as was generally said; yet this Mr. Vin cent, through anguish and horror at this accident, (as it was said,) within two years after wasted of an extreme atrophy of his flesh and spirits, that at length at the table"], [476, "6 FALMOUTH. whereby he was sitting, in the Bishop of Exeter's palace, in presence of divers gentlemen, he instantly fell back against the wall and died. Sir Peter Killigrew had issue also two daughters, the one married to Richard Erisey, Esq. and another married to Martin Lister, Esq. of Liston, in Staffordshire, a cap tain or lieutenant in Pendenis Castle, under John Earl of Bath ; upon whose issue by her Sir Peter settled much of his lands, on condition he should assume the name of Kil ligrew, and is now in possession of this lordship. The country people here about will tell you, (as such are superstitious enough to do,) that this murder or manslaugh ter of Mr. Killigrew by Mr. Vincent, whereby the male line of that family is extinct, was a just judgment of God ; for that Jane Killigrew, widow of Sir John Killigrew, Knt. aforesaid, his great-grandmother, in the Spanish wars in the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, went on board two Dutch ships of the Hans Towns, (always free traders in times of war,) driven into Falmouth Har bour by cross winds, laden with merchandize, on account (as was said) of Spaniards, and with a numerous party of ruffians, murdered the two Spanish merchants or factors on board those ships, and took from them two barrels or hogsheads of Spanish pieces of eight, and converted them to her own use. Now, though Fleta, Liber i. chap. iii. temp. Edward II. tells us that it is no murder except it be proved that the party slain was English, and no stranger, yet afterwards, by the Statute 4 Edward III. his son, chap. 4, the killing any foreigner under the King's protection, out of evil design or malice, is made murder, upon which Statute those of- fenders were tried and found guilty at Launceston of wilful murder, both by the grand and petty juries, and had sen- tence of death passed accordingly upon them, and were all executed, except the said Lady Killigrew, the principal agent and contriver of the barbarous fact, who, by the in- terest and favour of Sir John Arundell, of Tolverne, Knt. and his son-in-law, Sir Nicholas Hals, of Pengersick, Knt."], [477, "FALMOUTH. 7 obtained of Queen Elizabeth a pardon or reprieve for the said lady, which was seasonably put into the Sheriff of Cornwall's hands.

In like manner, about that time John Coldwell, Lord Bishop of Salisbury, passed the ma nor of Sherburne to the Crown, by whom it was given to Sir Walter Ralegh, Knt. which is also long since gone out of his name and family. The arms of Killigrew are, within a field Argent, an imperial eagle with two necks, within a bordure Bezante"], [478, "8 FALMOUTH. Sable. Which arms and bordure seem to inform us that this family was indirectly descended from Richard Earl of Cornwall. King of the Romans, by that concubine Jane de Valletorta, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston [see St. Stephen's by Saltash]. For that, as this bordure Bezante Sable was the proper arms of Richard Earl of Cornwall, viz. 5, 4, 3,2, 1, the imperial eagle was the cognizance of the said Earl of Cornwall as King of the Romans. Within this parish also now stands the borough town of Falmouth, which compound word is etymologized before. It was incorporated 14th Charles II. by the name of the Mayor and Aldermen and Magistrates of the Borough of Falmouth, with the jurisdiction of a Court-leet, wherein plea of debt and damage is tried within its precincts. But, alas ! notwithstanding its present grandeur, neither this town nor its modern name is of any great antiquity, neither being extant 500 years past; for long since that time it was known by no other appellation than that of Smith-ike, that is, the Smith's creek, leat, or bosom of waters, from a smith that lived at the creek, or cove, now in the centre thereof. And verily, I have been told by some aged per sons lately living, that they remembered not above five houses standing in this place ; though now, I suppose, they are increased to five or six hundred. And for its name Falmouth, it was not recorded till, at the request of Sir Peter Killigrew, it was inserted in its charter of incorpora tion as aforesaid. Which thing I do not mention to dis parage this really good name, but to let the inhabitants of this place, and many other families now flourishing in Cornwall, know that many of them are mistaken in their antiquity and former appellations, if truly examined. Moreover, concerning the first buildings of this town by John Killigrew, Esq. In 1613, happened a notable contro versy between him and the Corporations of Penryn, Truro, and Helston, which suggested, by a petition to James the First, promoted and backed by the interest of the Bur-"], [479, "FALMOUTH. 9 gesses thereof, viz. Sir Richard Robartes, Bart, and John Arundell, Esq. for Truro ; Sir Francis Godolphin, Knt. for Helston; Richard Penwarne, Esq. for Penryn; and others, \" that the erecting of a town at Smith-ike would tend to the ruin and impoverishing of the ancient coinage towns and market-towns aforesaid, not far distant from thence; and therefore humbly prayed the King's Majesty that the buildings and undertakings of Mr. Killigrew might be inhibited for the future.\" Who, upon receipt and hearing of this petition in Council, ordered the Lords thereof, Egerton, Buckhurst, Hume, Marre, Sir Robert Cecil, Principal Secretary of State, and others, to write to Sh Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollon, Knt. then Gover nor of Pendennis Castle, to be better informed of the true merits of this case, and to know his own particular senti ments about it. Which gentleman, as soon as he received this letter, made answer, that he well approved of Mr. Killigrew's project for building a town and custom-house at Smith-ike, as being near the mouth of the harbour of Falmouth ; and briefly, amongst many others, for these reasons especially : I. For the quick and necessary supply of such ships whose occasions, or contrary winds, brought them in there, without being obliged (as then they were) to go up two miles the river to Penryn, or nine miles to Truro, in order thereto, or to take in and out their cargoes or lading, and make entries at the. cus'tom-houses at such distance, by rea son of which delays of time they many times lost the oppor tunity of a fair wind to prosecute their intended voyages, longer than was for their advantage. 2. For the speedy supplying or reinforcing the Castle of Pendennis, contiguous therewith, with men, ammunition, and provisions, in case of any enemy's sudden invasion, or endeavouring to take the same by storm or surprise, before the country militia could be raised, or recruits brought in for that purpose. 3. For that other castles for the same reasons were"], [480, "10 FALMOUTH. built near towns, or towns erected near them, as Dover, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Newcastle, Gravesend, and many more.\" As appears more at large from the letters and reasons of Sir Nicholas Hals to the Lords of the Council aforesaid, whereof, by fees to the Clerk of the Council, or Secretary of State, copies were privately taken forth, at the special instance and request of the said Richard Penwarne, and other Members of Parliament then in London, who trans mitted them, by the hands of Mr. Anthony Mundye, to the Corporation aforesaid, where the writer of these lines hath had a full view of them, amongst the papers and records of the borough of Penryn, then lodged in the chest of its town-hall. Whereupon King James, upon a full hearing of this controverted matter between the parties aforesaid, and what could be alleged on either part, gave his opinion (with which all the Council agreed) that the erecting a town at Smith-ike by Mr. Killigrew, could in no sense be prejudicial to the coinage and incorporate towns aforesaid, they standing at such considerable dis tances from it ; but especially for that every man might lawfully do what he would for the utility and advantage of his own proper goods or lands, without the licence or ap probation even of the King, or any contiguous neighbour, who had no public or private nuisance thereby done him : how much more reasonable was it, therefore, when the owners of such lands converted them to such uses as tended not only to his own, but the public good and advantage of the king and country together. Whereupon Mr. Killigrew proceeded with his intended buildings, and his tenants, the inhabitants thereof, quickly grew rich by trade and merchandize both at home and abroad : so that in about twenty years' time the town be came notably famous in respect thereof, and is now, for wealth, trade, and buddings, scarcely inferior to any town in Cornwall. It is privileged also with a weekly market on Thursdays, and with fairs upon July 27 and October 30."], [481, "FALMOUTH. 11 The chief inhabitants of this town are Mr. Russell, Mr. Tresahar, Mr. Corker, Mr. Hill, Mr. Gwyn.

This town also was the honorary title of Charles Lord Berkeley, Viscount Fitzhardinge, created Lord Bottetourt and Earl of Falmouth, 17th March, 16th Charles II. 1664. He was slain in the Dutch wars 1665, without legitimate issue, and gave for his arms, Gules, a chevron Ermine, between ten crosses patee, 6 and 4, Argent. Afterwards it became the honorary title of George Fitz- Roy, third son of Barbara Duchess of Cleveland by King Charles the Second, by whom he was created Earl of Northumberland, Viscount Falmouth, and Baron Ponte fract in Yorkshire ; and giveth for his arms, the imperial shield of England, with a baton sinister, gobonee, Ermine and Azure. This Barbara Villiers was one of the daughters of the Lord Viscount Grandison, of the Kingdom of Ire land, and was married to Roger Palmer, Esq. created Earl of Castlemaine, in Ireland ; but afterwards, when Charles the Second took a liking to this Countess, he sent the Earl her husband, with his own good liking, Governor of a Castle and Colony of the English at Surat, in the East Indies. His lady King Charles further created Countess of Southampton and Duchess of Cleveland, during life. After the death of George Fitz-Roy, in the year 1722, Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan, Esq. Lord Warden of the Stannaries, was created tjy King George, Lord Bos cawen of Tregothnan, Baron Boscawen of Boscawen Bos, in Burian, and Viscount Falmouth. In this parish, on the lands of the manor of Arwynick (the Icta and Island of Diodorus Siculus aforesaid), upon"], [482, "12 FALMOUTH. a lofty peninsula or promontory of land, stands the famous and impregnable Castle of Pendennis, for which the Crown pays annually to the lord of the manor aforesaid, out of the Exchequer, about 13/. 6s. 8d. rent, as I take it. For the compound name Pen-deh-is Castle, it is British, and signi- fies that it is the head or chief man's castle, viz. the King or Earl of Cornwall. Otherwise, if the true name thereof be Pen-dun-es Castle, it signifies that it is the head or chief fort or fortress castle. This castle of old consisted only of a treble intrenchment of turf, earth, and stones, after the British and Roman manner, upon the top of the highest hill in those parts, abutting upon the west side of the mouth or entrance of the harbour of Falmouth, and containeth about twenty statute acres of ground within the lines. Repaired and indifferently fortified by Henry the Eighth, in the latter end of his reign, in the French war, with allowance of a petty garrison, whose daughter, Queen Elizabeth, in her Spanish wars, raised the new fort, and bettered the old fortification, as they are now extant; so that it is looked upon as one of the most invincible castles in this kingdom, having had in it above one hundred pieces of cannon mounted, and some thousands of foot arms. After Queen Elizabeth had thus fortified and munified the Castle of Pendennis, she placed therein a band of 100 soldiers, and over them placed as her Governor Sir Nicho- las Parker, Knt. (a Devonshire gentleman, as some say, though his arms, a fess fretty or chequey,* differs from the arms of Parker of Burrington,) of whom thus speaks Mr. Carew in his Cornish Survey, p. 150 : \" He now demean eth himself no less kindly and frankly towards his neigh bours for the present, than he did resolutely and valiantly against his enemies when he followed the wars, where through he commandeth not only their bodies by his autho- * The arms of Parker of Rathon, in Sussex, were, Azure, fretty Or, over all a fess of the Second.

His successor in the government of this castle was Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fen tongollan, Knt. (a domestic servant to Prince Henry, eldest son of James the First,) son of John Hals, of Efford, Esq. in Devon, who died Governor thereof in 1637; and was succeeded in that dominion by Sir Nicholas Slanning, of Marstow, in Devon, Knt. who was slain on the part of his master Charles the First against the Parliament army at the battle of Bristol, 6th July, 1643. After his death his widow (daughter of Sir James Baggs, of Plymouth, Knt.) was married to Richard Arundell, of Trerice, Esq. son of John Arundell, of that place, Esq. commonly called John of Tilbury, for that he was an officer under Queen Eliza beth when she was encamped there with her army, in ex pectation ofthe Spaniards landing, 1588. Which gentleman, (John Arundell,) was by Charles the First made Governor of Pendennis Castle; during whose command there happened a tragical siege thereof by the Parliament army under Colonel Fortescue; wherein the besiegers and the besieged showed unparalleled valour and conduct for about six months' space, when at length it was surrendered upon honourable conditions, the soldiers going forth with their arms mounted and colours flying, more consumed with sickness and famine within the walls than destroyed by their enemies from withont, having been driven to that extremity that the governor, soldiers, and many other gentlemen and ladies therein, were forced for some time to eat horseflesh, for want of other victuals ; as being hemmed in by the Parliament frigates at sea on the one side, and surrounded with their army at land on the other, so that no relief of men or provisions could be brought into the garrison, whereby it was forced to capitu late and surrender as aforesaid 1647, (before which time all other castles in England, except Ragland in Wales,"], [484, "14 FALMOUTH. were yielded up to the Parliament,) and the hunger-starved soldiers of Pendennis, that came out thence, feeding too freely on victuals and drink, brought themselves into in curable diseases, whereof many died; so that here, as in many other places, it was observed that more men and women died by two frequently putting their hands to their mouths, than by clapping their hands to their swords; as the Jews did on surrender of Jerusalem to the Romans, after the siege and famine there. After the surrender of this castle, as aforesaid, by Colo nel John Arundell, he was succeeded in that dignity by Colonel Fortescue, and he was succeeded by Captain Fox ; as after the restoration of Charles the Second, Fox was succeeded by Richard Lord Arundell, and he by the Earl of Bath. One Mr. Thomas Killigrew, of this Arwinick family, was Jester or Master of the Revels to Charles the Second, who, (to give but a single instance of his wit and humour,) having been at Paris on business, went to Versailles to see the French Court for diversion; where, being well known to many French courtiers who had been in England, he was by them introduced into Louis the Fourteenth the King of France's presence, who had a long time had a desire to see him whom fame reported the wittiest man in England. But at that time Killigrew was politically out of humour, and spoke very little, out of a desire he had to hear the wisdom of the French Court, and what little dis course he had it was trivial and of no consequence ; where upon King Louis told the noblemen that gave him such encomiums of his wit, that he looked upon him as a very dull fellow. Whereupon the courtiers told him, notwith standing what his Majesty's opinion was, assuredly he was a most ingenious and witty man. Whereupon, soon after, the King resolved to make a further trial of him, and therefore led him into a long gallery, where were many fine pictures, and asked Killigrew what they were ? And amongst the rest of those draughts showed the picture of"], [485, "15 FALMOUTH. our Saviour upon the Cross; and then again asked Killi grew if he knew what it was? To which, as to the for mer demands, he pleaded ignorance, and answered, \" No.\" \" Why, then,\" said King Louis, \" Monsieur Killigrew, \" I will tell you what they are. The picture in the centre is the draught of our Saviour on the Cross, and that on the right hand of him is the Pope's picture, and that on the left hand of him is my own \" To which Killigrew replied, \" I humbly thank your Majesty for the information you have given me, for though I have often heard that our Saviour was crucified between two thieves, yet I never knew who they were till now.\" Which sharp repartee convinced that King of his wrong opinion of Killigrew's wit in satire and ridicule, especially it being at the time when the Pope and French King grievously persecuted the French Protestants, and either dragooned them to mass or drove them out of France. Mr. Thomas Killigrew is further said to have put under the candlestick where Charles the Second supped, five small papers, on which he had written the word all. The King, on sight thereof, asked him what he meant by these five words of one signification. \" Your Majesty's pardon granted, I will tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Killigrew; which being promised, he said, \" The first All signified that the Country had sent all ; the second, the City had lent all ; the third, that the Court had spent all ; the fourth, if we did not mend all ; the fifth, that it will be worse for us all.\" This was reflected on the royal family of William the Third, \" That he was William Think-all ; his Queen Mary, Mary Take-all ; Prince George of Denmark, George Drink-all ; and the Princess Ann, Ann Eat-all, which ill habit diminished her health and hastened her death.\" TONKIN. Sir Henry Killigrew, Knt. married Katherine, the second daughter and coheir of Sir Anthony Cooke, of Giddy Hall,"], [486, "16 FALMOUTH. in Essex. Her other sisters married Sir William Cecil, Lord Treasurer, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Hobby, and Sir Ralph Howlet, Knts. Which ladies were all accounted of the most learned in the king dom, eminently skilled in the Latin and Greek tongues. To give an instance for the whole : Sir Henry Killigrew being appointed by Queen Eliza beth, ambassador to Henry the Fourth of France, lately turned Papist, was not very fond of that employment, and would have excused himself, but knew not how: where upon his lady wrote a letter to her sister Mildred, wife to Sir William Cecil, to try her interest with his lordship to get the Queen to excuse him, and that some other person might be appointed for that employment. The letter was these words : Si mihi quern cupio cures, Mildreda ! remitti, Tu mihi, tu melior, tu mihi sola sororj Sin male cunctando retines, vel trans mare mittes, Tu mala, tu pejor, tu mihi nulla soror : It si Cornubiam, tibi pax sit, et omnia l\u00e6ta, Sin mare \u2014 C\u0153cile ! uuncio bella. \u2014 Vale !

Whether this letter did procure Sir Henry Killigrew's stay, and dismission from the intended service, I am unable to resolve, although well assured I am that his daughter by this Catherine Cooke was married to Sir Jonathan Tre lawney, of Poole, Knt. Sheriff of Cornwall 36th Eliz. As for the harbour itself, it is agreed by all mariners to be one of the best for safe anchorage, large circumference, and good riding for ships, that this kingdom affords. The"], [487, "17 FALMOUTH. mouth or entrance, between the castles of Pendennis and St. Mawes, is about two miles over. The body ofthe har bour, from St. Mawes to Falmouth town, is about a league. From Falmouth to Turner's Weare, upon the river Vale, two leagues ; from whence an arm of it goes up towards Tregony, another towards Tresilian Bridge, a third to wards Truro ; all which places the salt water visits every tide. Beneath Turner's Weare, on the north, another channel goes by Restrongar Passage to Carnen, and St. Perron Arworthal. From Falmouth town goeth up an other creek to Penryn. Lastly, on the south there go into the country two creeks towards St. Mawes and St. An thony. All these members or branches of the harbour are overlooked by lofty and pleasant hills, and are supplied with deep water, so that boats, ships, barges, and lighters every day, one where or another, carry and recarry goods and mer chandizes to the remotest parts thereof. Hence it is that Mr. Carew says, \" a hundred sail of ships may lie at anchor within the harbour of Falmouth, and none of them see the other's topmast,\" because of the steep hills and windings of the river. The Killigrews are also lords of the land whereon the Castle of Pendennis stands, and receive yearly out of the Exchequer for the same 13/. 6s. 8d.

THE EDITOR. Falmouth Harbour, situated within thirty miles of the Land's End, is without all comparison the most advantage ous station for packets, maintaining a regular communica tion with Lisbon, the West Indies, and the Mediterranean. It has also been found admirably adapted for receiving smaller ships of war; a squadron of frigates, under the command of Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, of Admiral Pellew, &c. cruised from hence against the French during a part of the great contest following the Revolution ; but, although the largest ship may enter the port, and anchor there in safety, yet it is very inferior for their accommoda tion either to Plymouth or to Portsmouth. Falmouth is also a great resort of vessels coming from foreign countries, to receive orders as to their ultimate des tination ; and this is not only owing to the western situa tion of the harbour, but, in a very considerable degree, to the residence of a family which has maintained the highest reputation through a long series of years, as merchants, as men of integrity and of talent. They are said to be lineal or collateral relatives of the patriarch George Fox. On their first arrival in Cornwall, this family settled them selves at Par, near St. Austell ; but afterwards removing to Falmouth, they have mainly contributed towards the pros perity of the whole county, as merchants, as manufac turers, as spirited and enlightened adventurers in mines, and in the fisheries. Among many so eminent, it would be absolute injustice not to mention particularly Mr. Ro bert Ware Fox, who has most successfully employed his"], [489, "19 FALMOUTH. leisure in the philosophical investigation of geology and of chemistry, in connexion with mechanics, not only by his own exertions, but as the judicious and liberal encourager of similar pursuits in others. Many individuals have acquired wealth in Falmouth by a very peculiar species of commerce, carried on with Lis bon by means of the packets. The interchange of various commodities was legally prohibited, but at the same time practically allowed, by both Governments; and to such an extent did this half-contraband trade arise, that a Mr. Nowell, who kept a retail shop at Falmouth, is said to have made a fortune, by which his son became Sheriff of the county in 1787, chiefly as a carrier of these goods to and from London on packhorses; and a fortune still larger has been made by Mr. Russell, of Exeter, by conveying in creased quantities in waggons over improved roads, through Devonshire and Cornwall. It is quite impossible for such an harbour as Falmouth to have escaped the knowledge of the Ph\u0153nicians, when they came to Cornwall for tin, and strangely mistook it for a cluster of islands. The Greeks must also have known this port ; and the Romans not merely encamped in vari ous parts of the county, but having fixed stations within it, and on the very banks of the Fall, cannot have failed of noticing the longest and best roadsted and navigable river within the limits of Cornwall : but so vague and uncertain are all the descriptions transmitted to us either by geogra phers or by the writers of itineraries, that we are utterly unable to discriminate most places within certain limits of each other except by conjecture. It is truly a matter of astonishment that nations having made such ample progress in abstract geometry, and in astronomy itself, should have altogether disregarded latitudes which were within their reach ; and even approximations towards longitudes, which might have been obtained through the medium of lunar eclipses. c2"], [490, "20 FALMOUTH. Various names derived from ancient authors have been applied to Falmouth. Valuba is the one most commonly received. The Ocrinum promontory being taken for the Lizard, and Bolerium for the Land's End. The late Sir Christopher Hawkins seems to have esta blished, with the full degree of certainty applicable to such subjects, that the Ictis of Diodorus Siculus must have been St. Michael's Mount, and not the hill occupied by Pendennis Castle. The British name of Falmouth was Smithick. The last syllable, ick, has doubtlessly some reference to water. The few houses standing at Smithick before Mr. Killi grew built the new town, are said to have been called Pen ny-cum-quick; and an idle story is related of some old woman having brewed ale for a public meeting, and having apologized to the people when they assembled for all her stock being gone, by stating that foreign sailors coming to her house drunk the whole, and that \" Pennies came so quick\" she could not resist the temptation for parting with it. But the Right Hon. Charles Williams Wynn, M.P. for Denbighshire, has informed me that Pen-y-cwm-cuick is, in good Welch, the head of the contracted valley or dingle. Cuch signifies contracted, or knit together, as knitting the brows. This corresponds with the valley going up from the strand by the new market-house. Sir George Clark's seat, near Edinburgh, situated in a similar manner in respect to a narrow vale, is written Pen-y-cuick, and pronounced Penny-quick, the Celtic pen-y being always corrupted by Saxon lips into penny ; as Pen-y-darran, on the Taff. The church at Falmouth is dedicated to King Charles the First, with the proud additions of Saint and Martyr. It evidently suited with the views and with the interest of those in power after 1660, to identify Charles the First with the Established Church, and to inculcate that he died in its defence. The new church at Plymouth is dedicated in a similar manner to St. Charles ; and in this instance"], [491, "FALMOUTH. 21 the pleasure of outraging the feelings of their adversaries may have acted in aid of political expediency. Mr. Hals does not seem to have treated the very distin guished family of Killigrew in a manner that might have been expected, from his attachment to aristocracy in gene ral, or from his prejudices as a Cavalier. The horrible story of Jane Killigrew cannot possibly be true, in the manner or to the extent in which it is related, and the whole should have been omitted, were there not reasons for believing that it rests on some foundation. If the lady is exonerated from the most atrocious part of the tale, representing her as actually boarding the vessels and participating in the destruction of foreign merchants, and for which mere popular tradition at the interval of two centuries cannot form an adequate proof, we must not too rigidly apply the manners and feelings of our own times to a period so dissimilar. Many exploits performed by the great Sir Francis Drake, would now create very different impressions from those stamped on men's minds at the time ; and the more gentle and courteous, though not less brave, Sir Walter Raleigh, would now hardly escape with out blame. No one seems to have suffered greater degradation, from common report, than Mr. Thomas Killigrew. He is usu ally represented as the Jester, or even licensed, fool, of Charles the Second ; and the anecdotes given by Mr. Hals contain much more of rudeness than of wit. His history is thus related in the Biographical Dic tionary of 1784: \" Thomas Killigrew, descended from the ancient Cor nish family of that name, was a younger son of Sir Robert Killigrew, and born in 1611. He was distinguished by uncommon abilities. He was page of honour to King Charles the First, and groom of the bedchamber to King Charles the Second, with whom he had suffered many years of exile. During his abode beyond the sea, he took a view of France, Italy, and Spain, and was honoured by his Ma-"], [492, "22 FALMOUTH. jesty with the employment of Resident at the State of Venice. In his absence from this country he applied his leisure hours to poetry, and to the composition of several plays, of which Sir John Denham takes notice in his poem on our author's return from his embassy. Though Den ham mentions but six, our author wrote nine plays in his travels, and two at London ; all which were printed, with his picture before them, in 1664. There is, besides, \" A Letter concerning some Nuns in the Nunnery of Tours,\" dated from Orleans in 1635, and printed in three folio sheets. Mr. Killigrew died in 1682, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He had been twice married. \" He was a man of a very droll and uncommon vein of humour, with which he used to divert that merry monarch Charles the Second ; who on that account was fonder of him than his best Ministers, and would give him access to his person when he denied it to them. It was usually said of him, that when he attempted to write he was nothing near so smart as he was in conversation : which was just the reverse of Cowley, who shone but little in conversation, although he excelled so much with his pen. Hence Den ham, who knew them both, has taken occasion thus to cha racterize their respective excellences and defects : Had Cowley ne'er spoke, Killigrew ne'er writ, Combio'd in one, they'd make a matchless wit. Another brother, Henry Killigrew, is mentioned in the the same work, Chaplain to James the Second while he was Duke of York, and a Prebendary of Westminster. He is there stated to have written a tragedy at the age of seven teen, called \" The Conspiracy,\" which obtained the high approbation of Ben Jonson. He had a daughter, Ann Killigrew, recorded as A Grace for beauty, and a Muse for wit. This young lady was maid of honour to the Duchess of York, but died of the smallpox at the early age of twenty five."], [493, "FALMOUTH. 23 The elder brother, William, was also a poet and an author. The representative of the Killigrew family is Lord Wodehouse, in right of his late wife, Sophia Berkeley, niece of Lord Berkeley of Stratton. Falmouth has now outgrown the property of those who originally built the town, and is extended northward, at Green Bank, into the land of Lord de Dunstanville, where the houses have all the convenience and decoration suited to modern times. The older part of Falmouth, although it dates no further back than about two centuries, is un fortunately distinguished by its narrow, crooked streets, and by every defect usually found in the smallest fishing towns. It is, however, surrounded by beautiful villas. Falmouth has been associated, in 1832, with Penryn, in the privilege of sending two Members to Parliament.

Charles II. was the dwel ling, by lease, of Captain Thomas Penrose, whose father married Verman; originally descended from the Penroses of Penrose in Sythney. This gentleman having in his youth, temp. Charles I. been bred at sea, in the study and practice of the art of navigation, it appears from his jour nal that, in the year 1650, he was by the Admiral of the States of England made Captain or Commander of the Bristol frigate or man-of-war, in which he fought, together with the English fleet under command of General Blake, near Dover, against the Dutch fleet, under their General Van Tromp, who was shrewdly worsted by Blake. He was also in the engagement against the Dutch fleet under Sir George Ayscough, 1652, before Plymouth, where the victory inclined to neither side, but great losses on both. He also, 28th of October, the same year, fought in General Blake's squadron against the General of the States De Witt, who was then worsted, on one side of the North Foreland, in the Downs. Captain Penrose was also in that engagement between General Blake and Van Tromp wherein the English Fleet was worsted, and came off with great loss, so that Van Tromp sailed into the Downs in great triumph, with a broom on his main-topmast. But, maugre his success, pride, and insolence, the States of England fitted forth their shattered ships sooner than was expected, to the number of eighty sail of men-of-war, when Captain Penrose was removed from the Bristol to the command of the Maidstone frigate. Then also were Penn and Burne discharged from command of particular"], [496, "26 ST. FEOCK. squadrons, and the supreme command of the fleet was put into the hands of General Blake, General Monk, and General Dean ; when soon after happened that bloody and tremendous sea-fight betwixt the English and the Dutch fleets, before Weymouth and Dungeness, wherein General Monk declared (upon the sudden death of General Dean, killed at breakfast on the deck of their ship by Monk's side, with a defiance gun-bullet shot at random by the Dutch to his destruction) that this fifth battle should put an end to the war one way or other, and gave forth strict order and command to the officers of the English fleet upon penalty of death, that they should neither take from nor give quarter to the enemy ; which commands in the engage- ment being for a considerable time kept and observed by the English, the terror thereof so amazed the Dutch, that, after great losses of men and ships by them sustained, they declined to fight, and bore or ran away with their fleet, leaving the victory and British Channel wholly to the English fleet. In this fight, as appears from Penrose's Journal, he lost above fifty men out of the Maidstone, besides had many more wounded. Afterwards the English fleet, coasting westwards in pursuit of the vanquished Dutch fleet, were by cross winds forced into Falmouth harbour, where also for some days, as appears from Pen- rose's Journal aforesaid, he entertained at his house in this place of Le- Feock (opposite the harbour aforesaid) Gene- ral Monk, General Blake, Sir George Ayscough, and many other officers and gentlemen of the fleet, to good content and satisfaction. Afterwards they sent him many letters concerning the war, fleet, and ship he sailed in, and the course he should take; and in particular, amongst others, thanked him for his great valour and conduct in the several engagements aforesaid. From some of which it appears General Blake was a better soldier than scholar, as being very badly able to write the letters of his name to the letters his secretary had formed, as yet may be seen ; which is not to be won-"], [497, "27 ST. FEOCK. dered at, as I am credibly informed he was at first but a man of no higher education than that of a petty mechanic, viz. a ribbon and galloon weaver in Taunton ; whereof, at last, for his valour in the siege, in opposition to Charles the First, he was made governor thereof by the Parlia ment. Captain Penrose fought also in the Maidstone frigate under General Monk, in the sixth and last engagement of the English at sea against the Dutch fleet, wherein Van Tromp their general was slain, and his fleet extremely shattered, sunk, and disabled, to the great terror of the United Provinces. Then also the Maidstone frigate un derwent the loss of many seamen ; and the Captain con tinued his post till the restoration of Charles the Second, when he was dismissed from his command, and another commander placed in his room ; after which he retired to his country-house of Le- Feock aforesaid. It also appears from Penrose's Journal whilst he com manded the Maidstone, that she was one of the five ships under Sir George Ayscough that was ordered by the then Parliament of England to sail into the Sound, or German Sea, to assist the King of Sweden against the Danes. But a peace being concluded betwixt those nations, soon after the arrival of those ships, nothing of action was performed by them. Nevertheless, the King of Sweden rewarded the five captains of those ships in this expedition, with so many medals and neck-chains of gold, with the King of Sweden's face on one side of the medal, and the several arms of those gentlemen on the other, weighing about eighteen ounces each together with the chain. Penrose's medal is yet to be seen with his daughter. In the year 1664, when another Dutch and French war broke out between them and Charles the Second, and able sea-officers were wanted for the fleet, Penrose (who as aforesaid for several years had been displaced) had divers letters sent to him from James Duke of York, and the Duke of Albemarle (formerly General Monk), by order of"], [498, "28 ST. FEOCK. Charles the Second, requesting in this time of need that he would come up to London, accept of the command, and take the charge of the Monk frigate, in the Dutch war ; which at length with some reluctance he accepted. In which post he discharged the place with such care and faithfulness as before he had done in the Parliament ser- vice. And, moreover, in the three sea-fights which the Duke of York and the Duke of Albemarle had with the Dutch fleets, (in all which he was commanded, though but a third-rate ship, to follow the admiral or general's ships,) he behaved himself with such prudent valour and conduct (though with the loss of several hundreds of his men) that he preserved his ship, to the admiration of all that saw her, from destruction, though often boarded and surrounded with enemies. In brief, those matters are so abundantly set forth in the several letters of thanks, after those engagements, from the said Dukes and their Secretaries to Penrose, that if I should take the pains to transcribe them, they would only be thought a romance, as containing in them almost unpa rallelled adventures and dangers, which he most valiantly and successfully passed through, in the midst of seas, slaughter, fire, and bullets, were not the originals yet ex tant, and to be seen. Lastly, it appears from letters, and his Journal, which he kept daily for eighteen years' space, which he spent at sea in the public service of his country, that in the year 1667 he was by Charles the Second made Admiral of a squadron of ships of sixteen men-of-war, which were or- dered to cruise between Harwich and Newcastle towards the coasts of Holland, to watch the motion of the enemy. Where he received many letters by King Charles's order from the Secretaries of State, War, and Admiralty, as also from the Dukes aforesaid (yet to be seen), containing thanks for his good service, and further desiring the con tinuance of his care, conduct, and watchfulness against the enemy, whensoever they should put out to sea again : in"], [499, "ST. FEOCK. 29 the mean time to observe such further orders as should be sent him. In this kind of post he remained till his death, 1669, King Charles then owing him for his salary or pay above 1,500/. of which neither he nor his heir or executor ever received a farthing. His death was thought to be hastened through grief and vexation (being scarcely fifty-six years old when he died), and the occasion thus : \u2014 His ship, the Monk, being all manned with Cornish men in those three last engagements with the Dutch, who for the love and respect they bore him, their countryman, were all volun teers without being impressed for the public service ; now it happened that, in the year 1668, peace being concluded betwixt King Charles and the States of Holland, the greatest part of our English fleet were hauled up, the offi cers, seamen, and soldiers disbanded, without satisfaction, wages, or pay for their service ; and amongst them Captain Penrose's ship and squadron underwent the same fate. So that soon after, he happening to be at London upon some occasions, his disbanded company of Cornish men from the Monk, being far from home, were very troublesome and tumultuous with him about their pay, and so clamorous as to tell him that he, by his fair promises, had cajoled them into the public service, and that now they could get nothing for their labour and the hazard of their lives. The Captain answered for himself, as well- as he could, that it was his own case, as well as many other officers' and theirs, at this exigence to want his money, and therefore desired their patience till the King was better provided with cash for their satisfaction. But the Cornish men being more and more dissatisfied with him by those delays, and their wants and necessities pressing hard upon them, they formed a petition, setting forth the premises, to his Majesty, and with the same came to the Captain's cham ber, and endeavoured (after words would not prevail) to constrain or compel him in person to present it to the King's Majesty, which he refusing to undertake, a scuffle"], [500, "30 ST. FEOCK. happened at the top of the stairs between him and the peti tioners; in which conflict one Lampeer, of Truro, by thrust of Penrose's hands, his feet and hands failing, was thrown over the stairs, and so much bruised with the fall that soon after he died. Whereupon Penrose was apprehended, held upon bail, and afterwards indicted before the grand jury of Middle sex or Westminster, and found guilty of murder or man slaughter, and afterwards was tried for his life, and by the grand and petty jury found guilty of manslaughter : that is to say, the unlawful killing of a man without premeditated malice, (which is felony, because wilful \u2014 but admits of the benefit of clergy for the first crime,) whereupon Pen rose was condemned to death, and put into Newgate, where forthwith he received a reprieve or pardon of this offence from Charles the Second, under the broad seal of England, yet to be seen. Nevertheless, for the drawing, sealing, or procuring this pardon, the clerks and officers through whose hands it passed extorted from the Captain 200/. be fore he could get out of their hands to show it to the She riff of Middlesex. This unhappy accident so troubled Penrose, that, to put off the thoughts thereof, he kept company more than ordi nary with gentlemen and officers of the fleet and others; so that at length, by excess of drinking healths, and otherwise, he fell into a malignant fever, whereof he died, leaving issue one only daughter, his heir, named Martha, married to James Hals, of Merther, Gent.

In which assay-master's office he thrived so well, that at length he became a tin-factor himself, grew rich, and bought this place, and other lands near, as also the manor of Truro, of Sir Bevill Grenvill, Knt. But he and his security failing in paying the consideration money, he was cast into prison, where he died without further satis fation to his said creditor; notwithstanding which, those lands descended to his heir, now in possession thereof, ex cept the manor of Truro, sold to Samuel Enys, Esq. The Cornish tongue was retained in this parish by the old inhabitants thereof, till about the year 1640. Mr. William Jackman, then Vicar thereof, Chaplain of Penden nis Castle, at the siege thereof by the Parliament Army, was forced for divers years to administer the Sacrament to the communicants in the Cornish tongue, because the aged people did not well understand the English, as himself often told me. Now because it may not be unacceptable to the curious to know the Cornish words then used in administering the bread and wine to the communicants, I will here set them down, for their satisfaction : The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given An Gorse ay agan Arluth Jesus Chrest toan fe ry for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto eternal life ; rag thy, gwetha tha gorse hag eneff, warthe Ragnaveffera; take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died kemera hag dybbery henna en predery may Chrest marnans for thee, and be thankful. rag thy, hag be grassylen.

Master of Arts, who kept a school at St. Michael Penkivell Church, became afterwards a steward to Trefusis, St. Aubyn, Cory ton, and lastly came into the service of Brook Lord Chan dos, and having by these services accumulated considerable riches, he gave lands, and built and endowed an almshouse for poor people. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin does not make any addition to the history of this parish, except by stating that James Hals, who married Martha Penrose, the only child of Captain Thomas Penrose, was \" an elder brother of the author ; and that their eldest son, then about fourteen years of age, was engaged in the pursuit of his grandfather'^ profession, by serving as one of the King's scholars, or gentlemen volun teers, on board the Sunderland, Captain Tudor Trevor commander,receiving about 30/. per annum of his Majesty.\" THE EDITOR. Trelisick is now the most splendid feature of this parish. The situation, beautiful in all other respects, commands a view of the whole inland sea constituting Falmouth Har bour. The House was built about the middle of the last century, by Mr. John Laurence, a captain in the county militia, during the Seven Years' War, still remembered for his good-nature, convivial habits, and wild eccentricities. It is perhaps deserving of notice that the architect was Mr. Davy, grandfather ofthe celebrated chemist."], [503, "33 ST. FEOCK. The property became divided on Mr. Laurence's de cease; and it was purchased, about the year 1800, by the late Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell ; other lands were added to the domain, and the whole became a handsome seat suited to the natural advantages of the place. Still further additions and decorations have been made by his son, Mr. Thomas Daniell ; but this gentleman choosing to quit Cornwall, has sold the whole to Lord Fal mouth, the proprietor of Tregothnan, a still more magnifi cent seat, and removed from Trelisick only a few miles further up on the Truro river. Mr. Thomas Daniell, the grandfather, was chief clerk to Mr. Lemon, and having married Miss Elliott, niece of Mr. Allen, of Bath, he found himself enabled to take the whole of Mr. Lemon's great concerns off the hands of his executors in 1760; and soon after to build the house in Truro, remarkable not only on account of its being the largest and most decorated mansion in that very splendid town, but as being constructed of Bath Oolite, the gift of Mr. Allen, from Prior Park. Mr. Daniell continued throughout his whole life to con duct most extensive concerns as a general merchant, as a tin smelter, and, above all, as a spirited adventurer in mines on the largest scale. He left one son and one daughter. The daughter married the Rev. John Napleton, a dig nitary in the church of Hereford, and previously tutor at Brasenose college, Oxford ; where he is well known as the author of a work (\"Elementa Logic\u00e6, subjicitur Appendix de Usu Logic\u00e6 et Conspectus Organi Aristotelis\") which has been adopted into the lectures of every college through out the University. The son, Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell, continued most of his father's concerns, adding to them a large smelting-work for copper in Glamorganshire ; and so successful were his mining speculations, that he is said to have gained, in the course of a very few years, above a hun dred and fifty thousand pounds from Wheal Tower alone. VOL. II. D"], [504, "34 ST. FEOCK. Mr. Daniell was twice Member for West Looe. He married the only daughter of the Rev. Mr. Pooley, Rector of Ladock, and has left a numerous family. His eldest son has married Miss Osbaldeston, and they have several children. Killiganoon, probably the grove by the downs, is next to be noticed in Feock. The place was entirely created by Mr. Richard Hussey. This gentleman was the son of an attorney at Truro, who died insolvent, leaving a widow with one son, and three or four daughters. The son is represented to have exerted himself with efforts proportional to the embarrassments in which he found the affairs of his family, and he became in consequence one of the most distinguished lawyers of the time. He had the honour of being appointed Attorney General to the Queen ; and he was Counsel to the East India Company, and Member of Parliament, I believe, for Michael. Mr. Hussey died in the year 1770, under sixty, and divided his fortune among his sisters. One had mar ried the Rev. Mr. Vivian, and her grandson is the distin guished officer, General Sir Hussey Vivian. Another sister married Mr. Walker, of Lanlivery, and left an only son, the Rev. Robert Walker, Vicar of St. Winnow. A third sister married Mr. Ustick, of Penzance. Mrs. Mary Hussey, widow of Mr. Hussey of Truro, married, secondly, Mr. William Davies of St. Earth, a half-brother of the Editor's grandfather, where she con tinued to reside ; and her funeral appears on the parish register September 18th, 1750. Killiganeen was sold after Mr. Hussey's decease, and passed into the hands of Mr. Dagge. Two brothers of that name went to London from Bodmin to seek their fortunes. One became the manager of Covent Garden Theatre; the other pursued the law, to which both were probably edu cated, and ultimately retired to this place. It has since become the property of Admiral Spry, who improved and enlarged the house and the plantations ; and it belongs at"], [505, "ST. FEOCK. 35 this time to his son, Samuel Thomas Spry, Esq. M.P. for Bodmin. A coarse part of this parish remained uninclosed till within a few years, and was known by the name of Feock Downs. The surface appeared to be more smooth and even than any other piece of open ground in the west of Cornwall ; consequently, when local political dissensions were at a great height, about sixty years ago, this place was selected by one party for establishing races, in rivalship of others conducted by their opponents at Bodmin. These races fell, however, with the temporary feeling which gave them birth, and the ground is now inclosed. A small village in this parish is distinguished by the name of \" Come-to-Good ;\" a name probably given to it at first in ridicule, because there was established the earliest Quakers' meeting in that part of Cornwall. And, for some reason now quite forgotten, the first Sunday in August became designated all over that populous mining district as \" Come-to-Good Sunday,\" when several thousand persons continued to assemble, till the very prudent Society to whom the house belongs, adopted the expedient of discon tinuing their meeting on that particular day.

[Mr. Hals's history of St. Catherine is lost. It may, therefore, be sufficient to give the following short statement of her legend. In the 'MyvoKoywv, the Menology, (the Monthly Register, synonymous with Martyrology,) ofthe Emperor Basil, said to be composed by himself, but certainly written under his own inspection, St. Catherine is stated to have sprung from one of the families which in those times obtained a transient possession of the imperial throne."], [507, "37 FOWEY She was probably born at Alexandria, and suffered martyrdom there under the reign of Maximus the Second, about the year 310. Her learning, abilities, and zeal were so great, that, hav ing been ordered to dispute with several of the most able philosophers, she confuted them all, and even converted some among them to the Christian faith. These new pro selytes are said to have been instantly hurried to the flames, but that the Saint herself was reserved for a still more cruel fate, the persecutors of religion having contrived a wheel set round with hooks and spikes, for the purpose of tearing and lacerating its victim. The legends, however, go on to say that this horrible engine was dashed in pieces by angels, just as the tormentors were about to use it against the Saint, whom they nevertheless decapitated, unawed by the recent miracle, and no longer interrupted by any superna tural interference. The body of St. Catherine was found five hundred years afterwards, when the Saracens had possession of Egypt, although it is not recorded by whom the discovery was made, nor how the identity was proved. A subsequent great event, however, placed that most important circum stance beyond all doubt; for it having been resolved to translate the body from the immediate power of the Maho metans to a monastery built on Mount Sinai by St. He lena, and augmented by Justinian, a company of angels, probably the very same who destroyed the wheel, con veyed the relics to Mount Sinai through the air. Some recent martyrologists have endeavoured to explain away the latter miracle, by asserting that angels meant monks, who on account of the purity of their morals, the sanctity of their divine duties, and the eminent utility of their lives, are frequently confounded with the inhabitants of heaven. \u2014 It is almost needless to add that St. Catherine's Wheel has uniformly reference to the intended instrument of her martyrdom, and never to a spinning-wheel, of which the Saint is sometimes supposed in England to have bgpi the inventor.

It was incorporated by Charles the Second, by the name of the Mayor, Recorder, Portreeve, eight Aldermen, and a Town Clerk.

As also the writ for removing any action at law de pending in Foy court-leet to a superior court, must be directed to the Portreeve and Town Clerk or Steward. The arms of this town are, a ship in full course, with sails expansed, on the waves of the ocean. It is further privileged with a weekly market on Saturdays, and fairs annually, on Shrove Tuesday, Maylst, and September 10th. This town hath also added to its privileges some of the liber ties and freedoms of the Cinque Ports, which other towns or harbours have not : what they are, the inhabitants there best know. Those privileges were first granted only to the ports of Hastings, Hythe, Dover, Romney, and Sandwich, in Kent, by Edward the Confessor; afterwards much increased in the days of the three Edwards, the First, Second, and Third : which in this place are too long for me to recite. Mr. Carew tells us, that in Edward the Third's days sixty tall ships did belong to this harbour; and that the town of"], [509, "39 FOWEY Foys did assist that King with forty-seven sail of men-of war and transport-ships, anno Dom. 1347, in order to the siege of Calais ; whereupon that King granted commissions to the chief commanders of those Foy ships to take French prizes, during his wars with those people, or French nation ; so that in few years those Foy men were grown so rich and formidable, by taking French prizes, that by force and arms they would enter many ports of that kingdom, and carry with them all ships they could conquer, and what they could not, would use means to set them on fire in the places where they lay. In fine, when French prizes grew scarce, (I speak upon the authority of Mr. Carew,) they scrupled not to turn sea-robbers, or pirates, taking, plun dering, and destroying all ships they could master, of what country soever, not sparing the sailors' lives. By which means the townsmen grew unspeakably rich and proud and mischievous, which occasioned the Lord Po nder, and other Normans, to petition John, King of France, to grant them a private commission of marque and arms, to be revenged on the pirates and thieves of Foy town, which accordingly they obtained, and carried their design so secretly that a small squadron of ships, and many bands of marine soldiers, were prepared and shipped with out the Foymen's knowledge or notice, who accordingly put to sea out of the river Seine, in the month of July 1457, in 35th Henry VI. and with a fair wind sailed thence across the British Channel, and got sight of Foy harbour, where they lay off at sea till night, when they drew towards the shore and dropped anchor, and in the night landed their marine soldiers and seamen, and at midnight ap proached the south-west end of Foy-town, where they killed all persons they met with, set fire to the houses, and burned one half thereof to the ground, to the consumption of a great part of the inhabitants' riches and treasures, a vast deal of which was gotten by their piratical practices ; in which massacre and conflagration, the women, children,"], [510, "40 FOWEY and weakest sort of people, forsook the place, and fled for safety into the hill country. But others of the stoutest men, under conduct of John Treffrye, Esq. fortified themselves as well as they could in his then new-built house of Plase, yet extant, where they stoutly opposed the assaults of their enemies: whilst the French soldiers plundered that part of the town which was unburned, without opposition, in the dark. The news of this French invasion in the morning flew far into the coun try, and the people of the contiguous parts as quickly put themselves in arms, and in great multitudes gathered toge ther, in order to raise the siege of Foy ; which the French men observing, and fearing the consequence of their longer stay, having got sufficient treasures to defray the charge of their expedition, as hastily ran to their ships as they had deliberately entered the town, and as privately returned into France as they had clandestinely come into England, with small profit and less honour. The town of Foy being thus consumed by sire, and plun dered by the French soldiers and seamen, the inhabitants' former wealth and glory reduced to poverty and contempt, they politically cast themselves at the feet of Richard Nevill, Earl of Warwick (aforesaid), who, pitying their distressed condition, and being Lord High Admiral of England, granted some of them new commissions for privateering and taking French ships, on promise of their just and righteous proceedings, and renouncing the trade of piracy (for which reason their former commissions were revoked) ; whereupon in few years they plied their sea-business so effectually, that they increased their riches to such degree that they began to repair and rebuild their damnified houses, and in the stones of many of them, in memory of the Earl of Warwick's favour and bounty towards them, there is cut his arms, badge, and cognizance, as aforesaid.

But, instead of obeying the King's command and officer, in contempt of his autho rity they barbarously cut off his ears, and so dismembered sent him back to his master King Edward ; at which affront the King was so distasted, that soon after he sent down Commissioners to Lostwithiel, under pretence of raising able seamen to go in war against the French, and that such amongst them as appeared most fit and able should have command of some of the King's best ships. At this news a great part of the freemen and seamen of Foy were drawn to Lostwithiel; where they no sooner came, but immediately they were apprehended and taken into custody for the crimes aforesaid, their ill-gotten goods and chattels seized by the Sheriff and King's officers, and one Harrington, a most notorious pirate, executed; and the chain of their harbour was removed to Dartmouth.

At the mouth or entrance of this harbour, are two petty bulwarks, or blockhouses, the Polman, or Porth-Eran on the Lanteglos side, the other at St. Catherine's, under Foy town, most famous for a fight they had with a Dutch man of-war of seventy guns, doubly manned, that was sent from their main fleet of ships of eighty sail, that lay at anchor"], [512, "42 FOWEY and cruised before this haven, 16th July, 1666, then in pursuit of our Virginia fleet of eighty sail, which, escaping their cognizance, safely got some hours before them into this harbour, and, on notice given of the war, sailed up the branches thereof as far as they could, and grounded them selves on the mud lands thereof. Notwithstanding which, this Dutch frigate resolved to force the two forts or fortresses aforesaid, and to take or burn our said Virginia fleet. Accordingly, it happened on that day, a pretty gale of wind blowing, this ship entered the haven, and as soon as she came within cannon-shot of those forts, fired her guns upon the two blockhouses with great rage and violence ; and these made them a quick re turn of the like compliment or salutation. In fine, the fight continued for about two hours' time, in which were spent some thousands of cannon-shot on both sides, to the great hurt of the Dutch ship, in plank, rigging, sails, and men, chiefly because the wind slacked, or turned so adverse, that she could not pass quick enough between the two forts up the river, so as to escape their bullets, but lay a long time a mark for them to shoot at, till she had opportunity of wind to tack round, turn back, and bear off at sea to their fleet, to give them an account of her unsuccessful attempt and great damage as aforesaid, to the no small credit and reputation of Foy's little castles, manned out with gunners and seamen from the ships of the Virginia fleet for that purpose, who all, by reason of the walls and intrenchments thereof, were preserved from death, notwith standing the continual firing of the cannons of the Dutch man-of-war upon them ; whereby the contiguous lands by the bullets were ploughed up, to the terror and astonish ment of all beholders. After this engagement, the cargo of the whole Virginia fleet was landed at Foy, (its owners at London fearing the hazard of the sea in time of the Dutch war, to transport it there by water,) and gave opportunity to the townsmen to buy much tobacco at a very cheap rate, which instantly, upon"], [513, "43 FOWEY. the conclusion of the peace between England, France, and Holland, was sold in this kingdom, France, Spain, and Holland, at a dear rate, and much enriched the townsmen thereby, as Mr. Major, one of those merchants, informed me. The chief place in this town is Plase, in British a palace, which is the dwelling of John Treffrye, Esq. so called from some of the many local places passing under that denomi nation in Cornwall, and compounded of treu or tref fi-ye, synonymous words, signifying the free or manumitted town. He was the son of John Treffrye, of Rooke, Esq. that married Vivian of Truan ; the which John Treffrye succeeded to the patrimony or lands of the Treffrys of this place, more for similitude of name than consanguinity or affinity of blood, by the will, devise, or entail of the last gentleman that died without issue in this house. The pre sent possessor, as aforesaid, is John Treffrye, Esq. my very kind friend and kinsman, Member of Parliament for the town of Foy, whereof comparatively he is lord and high lord. He married Stephens. His predecessors in this place were gentlemen of great fame and estates, and have served their country in the several capacities of Parliament men for this town, justices of the peace, and sheriffs of Cornwall ; particularly John Treffrye, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 1st Richard III. 1482. He was a great benefac tor towards building the present church of Foy, as appears from his arms being cut in divers places of the stones and tower thereof. Sir John Treffrye, Knt. (probably his son), was Sheriff of Cornwall 5th and 15th Henry VII.; William Treffrye, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 16th Hen. VII. 1501, when Richard Whiteleigh, of Efford, was Sheriff of De von. The arms of those gentlemen are, Sable, a chevron between three hawthorns Argent (i. e. summer thorn, hau, haw, in British is summer). The chief inhabitants of this town, besides Mr. Treffrye, are Mr. Pomeroy, Mr. Goodall, Mr. Major, Mr. Toller, Mr. Tyncombe, and others. In this town Philip Rashleigh, Esq, temp. Charles I. built and endowed a hospital with the garb or tithe sheaf"], [514, "44 FOWEY of the parish of St. Wen for ever, towards the relief of six poor widow women, two of the said parish and four from from another parish, who receive weekly \\5d. in money, and suits of apparel yearly, with other privileges, but are prohibited from begging the country, or any parish stipend. [See Tvwardreth.] This gentleman got great riches by trade and merchan dize, and sea adventures ; more particularly by a small ship or frigate, of about eighty tons, bearing about sixteen can nons or demi-culverins, besides small arms, and 60 men, for defence thereof; the commander of which ship had a com mission from Queen Elizabeth as a privateer, in her wars with the Spaniards, to take all Spanish ships it sliould meet with at sea, and make them prizes for him, his adventurers, and the Queen's advantage, which said privateer, or man of-war, was so successful and fortunate in its adventures at sea for some years, and in traffic, and merchandizes, and prizes, that those gentlemen accumulated and laid up great riches thereby ; and in remembrance and memory of this ship, caused the figure in memory of it to be to be perpe tuated in a small ship, about five feet long, made and formed by a ship carpenter, of timber, with masts, sails, ropes, guns, and anchors, and figures of men thereon ; which is hanged up to the roof, or planking, with an iron chain, in their old house in this town, of which ship those gentlemen have often given me ocular observation, as well as told me the above history of the premises, in the time of Charles the Second. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least importance but what is copied from Mr. Hals. the editor. I have retained the whole of what is stated by Mr. Hals respecting the proceedings at Fowey, in the periods of its"], [515, "45 FOWEY greatest prosperity and of its subsequent fall, given partly on the authority of Mr. Carew, (p. 313, &c. of Lord Dun stanville's edition,) and in part from what he himself had heard. It must, however, be remembered that tradition always exaggerates facts, more especially such as bear un favourably either on individuals or on communities, and that the times of Edward the Third were essentially dif ferent from those of order, protection, and impartial admi nistration of justice, in which we have the happiness to live; nor can the license or excesses imputed to some adven turers at Fowey, be more abhorrent to our feelings than the mean artifice of a feeble government, practised to entice men from Fowey to Lostwithiel, under a pretence of enabling them to assist their country in the prosecution of a war, but really with the view of arresting them as criminals. The fact of this port having sent forty-seven ships, with seven hundred and seventy mariners, to the siege of Calais in 1346-7, would exceed all belief, were it not esta blished by national records; and Mr. Carew relates their vanquishing, in a private feud, the naval armaments of Win chelsea and Rye, two members of the Cinque Ports (p. 315). But these two ancient towns, and the Five Ports themselves, exhibit a contrast scarcely less remarkable than Fowey, between their actual appearances and the relative importance they must have once attained ; except that Hast ings is enlarged for the temporary residence of strangers, and Dover from the like cause, in addition to its being the well-known station for packets. It is quite certain that the Priory of Tywardreth exer cised considerable feudal authority over Fowey, which, however, not only fell into disuse after the general dissolu tion of monasteries, but, in all probability, was greatly diminished by the subsequent incorporation ofthe town. The right of voting for Members of Parliament, up to the period when it discontinued to send any, in 1832, was vested jointly in resident payers of scot and lot, and in"], [516, "46 FOWEY. copyhold tenants of the manor taken from Tywardreth by Henry the Eighth, and annexed by him to the Duchy of Cornwall. This manor was purchased by the late Mr. Philip Rash leigh, about the year 1800, under the powers created by the Land Tax Redemption Act. This gendemen and his ancestors had long represented Fowey, and he was suc ceeded by his nephew, Mr. William Rashleigh, who sub sequently sold the manor, and the whole borough property, to Mr. George Lucy, of Charlecot, near Stratford-upon- Avon. Mr. Lucy, in consequence, represented Fowey, and retained what he had purchased till in 1832 it became quite useless for all election purposes. Mr. Joseph Thomas Austen is the present representa tive of the ancient and distinguished family of Treffry, one of the most spirited adventurers in mines, and of the most judicious and enlightened managers, that Cornwall has wit nessed for many years. Mr. Austen has diverted a river for the use of machinery ; and he has sat the first example of bringing a canal to mines, for the purpose of conveying coal and other heavy articles, from the sea-coast, and of taking down the ores, which are then exported from a har bour of his own construction. Mr. Lysons gives an account somewhat different from that of Mr. Hals, respecting the final repulse of the French from Fowey. He attributes the achievement to one of Mr. Austen's female ancestors; and, quoting from Leland, adds that after this event \" Thomas Treffry builded a right fair and strong embattled tower in his house, and embat tling the walls of the house, in a manner made it a castle, and even to this day it is the glory of the town buildings in Fowey.\" The present possessor has, however, added con siderably to the beauty of this \" right fair \" mansion, by completely restoring whatever might be defective in the existing parts, and by completing, or perhaps by improving, the original plan. The late Mr. Philip Rashleigh, who represented Fowey"], [517, "FOWEY 47 during the greater part of a long life, added to his charac ter of a most respectable country gentleman, the well deserved reputation of a skilful and zealous naturalist, more especially in the department of minerals, to which, as a Cornish man, his attention would be more particularly directed. Mr. Rashleigh led the way in Cornwall as a collector, on a large scale, of the interesting and curious products of the mines, and left at his decease perhaps the most valuable collection of minerals belonging to any indi vidual throughout England. Geology had not acquired the semblance of a regular science when Mr. Rashleigh directed his attention to the metallic ores, and to the chrys tallography, not of Cornwall alone, but of all parts of the known world. He has given to the public two volumes of coloured engravings from his choicest specimens. Mr. Rashleigh attained a good old age, with the satisfac tion of witnessing the progress through life, in various lines, of the younger branches of his family, with the highest credit to themselves, and of leaving his ample property to a nephew in all respects worthy of receiving it. For various further details respecting Fowey, the Editor must refer to the recent Histories of Cornwall. Mr. Lysons gives an ample account of the descents or alienations of manors ; and a very curious letter from Lord Thomas Cromwell to the Prior of Trewardreth, dated on the 21st of May, but without the insertion of any year, probably, however, not long before the dissolution. See p. 109 of Lysons's Magna Britannia, vol. iii. Cornwall. A considerable property was accumulated about the middle of the last century by two brothers, natives of this town, of the name of Lamb. One filled the office of Col lector of the Customs at Fowey, the other practised medi cine at St. Austell ; both left their fortunes to an only sister, who after their deaths, and late in life, married Mr. Gra ham, a gentleman from London ; through whom the pro perty has passed to his nephew, Thomas Graham, Esq.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. This little parish is formed by a belt of high and pre cipitous hills, and is principally composed of a very in teresting rock. It is of a dark colour, does not alter in the streak, and abounds in iron pyrites; it is a kind of shale, and in the cliff, not far from the church, contains a layer of some carbonaceous mineral, to the intimate diffusion of which the colour of this rock appears to be owing. The section of the hill by the road side, from the church to Valancey Bridge, exhibits the layers of this rock convoluted and contorted in a most extraordinary manner; and the same appearance is beautifully illustrated in the cliffs at the entrance of Boscastle harbour.

Tregeare, in this parish, was the voke lands of the Bishop of Bodmin, now the Bishop of Exeter's great lordship, so called. In the Domesday Book for Cornwall, 20th Wil liam I. 1087, it is named Tregara-an, id est, the town of the friend, or lover, of God. Concerning the possession of this manor, by virtue of the Bishop of Exeter's lease, there happened a costly and troublesome suit, both in law and equity, between Edward Nosworthy, Esq. then in possession thereof, and Hugh Trevanion, of Treligan, Esq. in the latter end of the reign of Charles the Second, James the Second, and part of the reign of Wrilliam the Third (as I was informed). The case being thus : The tenure of those lands being copy of Court Roll, or freehold for life, the Bishop of Exeter, the lessor, grants to the lessee a fee-farm lease of the said manor, for three lives absolute : and so, by custom and law, each of these lives named in the said lease are entitled to the land suc cessively after each other's death, and have power succes sively in like manner to grant copies of court roll to the under-tenants of those lands absolute for three lives, to succeed each other. Now it happened that Trevanion bought the remainder of one of those lives, in reversion, of E 2"], [522, "52 GEKANS. Nosworthy or some other first life named in the Bishop's lease; after the death of whom, Trevanion's right by cus tom commenced ; who accordingly delivered ejectments up on the lands and tenements of the said manor, by consent and approbation of the Bishop of Exeter for the time be ing, and brought down a trial at Launceston on the same, where the issue passed for Trevanion. Thereupon Nosworthy filed his bill in chancery, prays a writ of injunction to stop further proceedings at common law, and to be relieved in the premises ; where, after many commissions for examination of witnesses, and hearing of the merits of the cause in favour of Nosworthy's title, it passed for him. The plaintiff Trevanion thereon prays that an other issue at law might be directed out of Chancery to try this matter; which accordingly being granted, upon the issue it again passed for the plaintiff, and afterwards, as before, upon all hearings in Chancery it passed against him, by the universal opinion and judgment of the Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers for the time being : \" That it was contrary to equity and good conscience that any person, who was only named a life on the bishop's lease, to the farmer cf the manor, or the lives named on the farmer's lease, or copy of court roll, to under-tenants, without ever paying a farthing consideration of money, should sell or carry away the original lessee's estate, who pays a valuable consideration for it, or from his heirs or assigns after his death.\" So that, in fine, Nosworthy's title was confirmed by a decree in Chancery. But, as I said before, the cost of this controversy pro and con lasted so long, and proved so chargeable, as was very conducing to the ruin of both those gentlemen's estates, (vide Cargoll in Newland,) Nosworthy absconding into Holland, and Trevanion pro curing himself to be made one of the Poor Knights of Windsor. It was the happiness of Cornwall, in the latter end of the reign of Charles the Second, to behold Mr. Justice Dolben, appointed for two or three Assizes one of the Judges Itine-"], [523, "53 GERANS. rant for this county, who so discouraged the injustice, delay, and frivolousness of many Cornish law-suits, and so up rightly and succinctly, upon proof of matters of fact and law, directed the jury as to their verdict, that there was little or no occasion for the wrangling and jangling argu ments of counsel at the bar. He further told the people in general, that he admired how they should be so weak in judgment, as to be persuaded into so many lawsuits in this province, wherein was nothing but pride, heat, mistakes, or malice, by the advice and direction of lawyers and attor nies, whose trade and occupation was only to get money, without regard had to the merit or success of their causes longer than their client could dispense with cash. Upon those and the like arguments of this upright and conscien tious judge, the number of our Cornish trials was much abated, and fell from a hundred and sixty venire facias brought to about seventy; so that it was generally hoped by this means we should have had as few lawsuits depend ing in this as in other countries, or that all controversies would be ended by references amongst ourselves, and that it would be said of the Court of Common Pleas by com mission transmitted to Launceston, as was said of the Court of Chancery when Sir Thomas More was Lord Chancellor thereof, tempore Henry VIIL, who by his upright judg ment, and discouragement of trivial Chancery suits, had ended all causes depending therein, so that the clerks and counsel had no more business there to do ; whereupon one made this rhyme : When More some time had Chancellor been, No more suits did remain: The like will never more be seen, Till More comes back again. But, alas ! this good Judge Dolben soon after, by the attornies and lawyers of the Western Circuit all in confe deracy together, as the shrine-makers of Diana at Ephesus against St. Paul, prompted a petition to Charles the Second against him, suggesting that the overhasty proceedings of"], [524, "54 GERANS. this judge, and his discouraging lawsuits, tended not only to the damage of his Majesty's revenues proceeding from lawsuits in those parts, but to their great prejudice, hurt, and damage, in point of their support and livelihood, as having little else besides their profession and practice of law to subsist by ; which petition Charles the Second taking into further consideration, against the next assizes he or dered the clerk to leave Judge Dolben's name out of the commission of oyer and terminer, and then he was never more seen in those parts. Since which time the judges that come this circuit are content to hear with great pa tience the loud, reflective, perplexed arguments of counsel upon trials of small moment and concern, if not to suffer themselves to be at some times imposed upon in point of law and evidence therein, by the importunate arguments of topping serjeants-at-law, according to the magnitude ofthe fees they receive from their clients ; so that it is become a proverb among those men in this province, it matters not what the case be so the client hath store of money. Tre-ligan, or Tre-ligon, in this parish, (i. e. the legate, nuncio, or ambassador's town, perhaps the rector's,) is the dwelling of the said Hugh Trevanion, Gent, a branch of Caryhaye's family. He married Crossman, the relict of Courtney of Penkivell, and had issue by her Tre vanion, Gent, his son and heir, whose estate being greatly depressed by his father's debts and lawsuits aforesaid, hath sold his patrimony, and is by Hugh Boscawen, Esq. Privy Councillor to WTilliam the Third, promoted to be one of the Poor Knights of Windsor as aforesaid.

Most of the lands in this parish, if not the whole, are either part of the manor of Tregear, or are held from it. This hath been, ever since the first erection of the see, in the Bishop of Cornwall, and in the united bishopric seated at Exeter. It has for many ages been held by different gentlemen under the Bishops, on leases for lives. The family of Nosworthy held it for some time; the last of which family, Edward Nosworthy, Esq. assigned it, a few years before his death, to Henry Vincent, of Trele van, Esq. but Mr. Nosworthy, who was the last life, dying suddenly at Dunkirk in 1701, it fell into the Bishop's hands, then Sir Jonathan Trelawny, who granted a new lease of it in trust for his own family, with whom it now resteth. But the barton was separated from the manor and granted apart, as it was in the time when Nosworthy held the ma nor, to the Trevanions of Trelegar, between whom and the Nosworthys arose a great lawsuit, as is related by Mr. Hals. Near to this barton is Trewithian, that is, the town of peace. In this village Mr. Edward Cregoe hath lately built a good house. He married Sarah, the daughter of John Foot, of Treleyassick, Gent, and is lately dead, leaving a young widow and three sons, of which the eldest is chris tened Friend. To the south of this is Trelegar, the downy town. This is likewise a large village, at one end of which stood the seat of a younger branch of the Trevanions of Carhays. Hugh Trevanion, who was engaged in the expensive law suit with Mr. Nosworthy, had a son, Hugh Trevanion. This gentleman was so reduced as to become Governor of the Poor Knights of Windsor. The father sold Trelegar. in the latter end of Charles the Second's reign, to Stephe n Johns, Esq. i"], [526, "56 GERANS, Between Trelegar and Trewithian is a double round Danish intrenchment, which being very high, the middle serves for a beacon, by which name of Beacon it is called. To the westward of Trewithian is Tregalravean, that is the small miry dwelling ; and such it really is. This place has recently been leased by copy of court roll from the manor of Tregear, to Edward Hobbs, Gent. Roseteage. This is rightly interpreted by Mr. Hals, the fair or beautiful valley ; and its delightful situation doth fairly entitle it to this appellation. This place, in the reign of Elizabeth, and of James the First, was the seat of Reginald Mohun, Esq. a younger brother to Sir William Mohun, of Hall, and a captain un der Sir Walter Raleigh. This gentleman never marrying, sold the barton (which is held from the manor of East Greenwich, in Kent, by the payment of three peppercorns yearly when demanded,) with the royalty of wreek, and in November 1619, the 19th year of James the First, to Nicholas Kempe, Gent, who was the younger brother of Humphrey Kempe, of Lavethan, in Blisland, Esq. who is the chief of that name in Cornwall. THE EDITOR. Since the splendour of the Bishop's residence has disap peared, if it ever existed, Roseteague has been, without all comparison, the leading place in this parish, and indeed few more beautiful situations can any where be found. It continued in the family of Mr. Kempe from the year 1619 till about 1780, when Roseteague was purchased by Mr. Harris, of Rosewarne, in Camborne, aad given by him to Mr. Richard Harris, one of his younger sons; but this gentleman having remained single, the estate has reverted to the only daughter and heiress ofthe eldest son, William Harris, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall in 1773, married to Henry WTinchcombe Hartley, Esq. of Berkshire."], [527, "GERANS. 57 Trewince, situated on a hill northward of Roseteague, and separated from it by a deep valley, is also a place well deserving of notice. An extremely good house was built here about the year 1750, by the grandson or great-grand son of the gentleman who made the purchase of Trelegar from Mr. Trevanion, and it is now inhabited by his grand son. The church commands an extensive prospect from an elevated piece of ground, and contains a splendid monu ment to the family of Hobbs ; and near the church still exists a public bowling-green. Bowling appears to have been the favourite amusement of gentlemen residing in the county up to a later period than the middle of the last century. A weekly meeting used to be here numerously attended during the summer, but as most landed proprie tors then occupied a portion of their own estates, it was an invariable rule to discontinue their pastime when the ap pearance of a single Arrish Mow, indicated the more im portant avocations connected with harvest. Mr. Hals has noticed that a Bishop of Exeter endowed this church, the one half as a rectory, the other as a vi carage. This division was effected in a very unusual man ner, although in one not quite without example. Instead of apportioning the tithe of corn to the rector, and all other portions, as small tithes, to the vicar, the whole has here been divided into equal shares; so that Mr. Johns, of Trewince, the lay impropriator, is entitled to one-twentieth of every thing titheable, and the incumbent to another twentieth. On the coast eastward of the church town is a village called Polskatho, or Porthskatho, the boat-harbour ; and here an extensive fishery is carried on, more especially for mackarel. This place, with the manors of Pettigrew and Nanquitty, belongs to J. S. Enys, of Enys, Esq. and they have been long possessed by this very ancient and respect able family. The barton of Tregeare was purchased in 1712 of the Hoblyns of Bradridge, by Samuel Kempe, Esq. of Car-"], [528, "58 GERANS. clew. In 1765 it was leased by Frederick Bishop of Exeter, on lives, to Nicholas Kempe, Esq. of Rosteague, of whom it was purchased in 1767 by his cousin Nicholas Kempe, Esq. of Chelsea, and it remained in 1823 in the possession of John Kempe, Esq. of Newington, Surrey. The Kempes sold Rosteague to John Harris, Esq. in 1780. Trewithian is now vested in Matthew Garland Cregoe, Esq. who married Anna Coryton Kempe, eldest daughter of the late Arthur Kempe, Esq.

King Athelstan, being in full possession of all England, gaue to God one mansion, tarrying, or abiding place, for laying the foundation of a monastery of monks, and for St. German's canonical bro thers and servants in Cornwall. He also enriched with jewels, money, or lands, every considerable abbey in this land. Baker's Chron. p. 10. This Abbey of St. German's was afterwards endowed with larger revenues by King Canute, anno Dom. 1020, who turned it, after ninety years continuance in monkery, to a collegiate church of secular canons, which might marry wives, converse in the world, as not tied to a monastic life, first introduced by St. Berinus, Bishop of Dorchester, anno Dom. 635 ; that is to say, a society or corporation of reli gious men, under the government of a dean, warden, pro vost, and master, to whom belonged clerks, chaplains, sing ing men, or choristers. Of those men, the gloss upon the Canons Clementine tells us, that secular priests have no certain order or fashion of apparel appointed them, foras much as there is no express mention made in any canon, neither of the colour or form thereof, by which two dif ferences the other several orders of religious men and wo men are distinguished or discerned. In this Abbey of St. German's, anno Dom. 986, Bishop Stidio placed the see or seat of his Cathedral Church, (for Bodman was before burnt by the Danes,) which he and his successors enjoyed till the year 1032, at which time Livig nus, first a monk of Winchester, afterwards Abbat of Ta vistock, then made Bishop of Kirton, by King Canutus, who after the death of Berwoldus, the thirteenth Bishop of Cornwall, prevailed with that King to annex the bishopric"], [531, "st. German's. 61 of St. German's, thus translated there, to his bishopric of Kirton, and turned this college of secular priests into a priory of Black Canons Augustine, from whence afterwards Leofrick, chaplain to King Edward the Confessor, 1049, by licence, consent, and approbation of that King, removed both those bishoprics to Exeter. And this fact of Kirton is more manifest from the missal or mass book of the said Leofrick, given to the church of Exeter. This Monastery or Abbey of St. German's, founded by King Athelstan, was as aforesaid by King Canute turned into a collegiate church of secular canons, over which a prior was governor or ruler, who, after he had endowed the same with lands and revenues, King Ethelred the Second having before given Bishop Stidio, to recompense his loss by the Danes, the great lordship of Cunan Boake, still per taining to the Bishop of Exeter (see Prince's Worthies of Devon, p. 9) he ordained many good laws which sound thus in English: \" We will and command that God's Ministers, the Bi shops, Abbats, Priors, &c. do in especial manner take a right course and live according to rule, that they call to Christ night and day much and oft, and that they do it ear nestly : and we further command that they hearken to God, and love chastity ; full truly they wit that it is against the right to meddle with women.\" Canute's Laws, No. 6. The word abbat is derived from the Hebrew abba, pater, for that he is the father or governor of his monks, who to gether make up a spiritual society or corporation. Some abbats were elective by the convent, others presentative, and under this title also was comprehended other corpora tions spiritual, as a prior and his convent, friars, canons, and such like ; and as there were lord abbats so there were lord priors, who had exempt jurisdiction, and were lords of par liament, and what consecration is to a bishop, the same is benediction to an abbot or prior, but in different respects, for a bishop is not such before consecrated, but an abbat or"], [532, "62 st. German's. prior, being elected or confirmed, is properly such before be nediction. Some abbats were mitred from the pope, and so exempt from the bishop's jurisdiction, as having granted them from him episcopal authority; and if either abbats or priors were called by the King's writ as barons to parliament, they were called abbats and priors sovereign ; see statute 9th Richard II. chap. 4. But, alas ! neither this Abbat of St. German's, nor the Prior of Bodmin, nor any other in this province, was either a baron of Parliament or a mitred man, but were all subject to the visitation and spiritual government of the Bishop of Exeter, till 23d Henry VIII. when all those orders of religious men were dissolved. In this abbey of St. German's, anno Dom. 1040, in the time of Lurginus Bishop of Kirton, lived Hucarius, com monly called the Levite, as Bale and Pits, in their writ ings of Britain, tell us ; either for that he assisted the priest at the altar as the Levites of old did, and was more excel lent, or did excel all others in that particular ; otherwise, by the appellation Levite we must understand him a priest, and that he was universally famous in performing his func tion of preaching and divine service. Certain it is, he was a holy and learned man, (according to the laws of King Ca nutus aforesaid,) as the 110 homilies or sermons, and many other books which he wrote, declare ; but whether he was a native of this province or not, I know not. This Priory of Canons Augustine was dissolved 26th Henry VIII. and its revenues valued per annum 243/. 8s. ac cording to Speed and Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum. This borough town of St. German's, as Mr. Carew saith, mustereth many inhabitants, and sundry ruins, but little wealth; occasioned either by abandoning their fishing trade, as some conceive, or their being abandoned of their religious people, as others imagine. It appears to have been the voke lands of a manor before the Norman Con quest; since it is rated in Domesday Roll, 20th William I. 1087, by the name of Abbytone, i. e. abbey-town, (for that"], [533, "st. German's. 63 before that time it was a monastery or abbey of monks,) and consists of a Portreeve and forty Censors; and the Portreeve yearly chosen, in the manor court, by the major part of the Censors. And the Members of Parliament are in like manner elected by the major part of them, and the precept from the Sheriff for their election, (as also to re move any action at law depending in this to a superior court,) must be thus directed: \" Pr\u00e6posito et Seneschallo Burgi nostri de St. German0, in Comitatu Cornub. salu tem,\" Sec.

It is further privileged with a weekly market on Friday, and a fair yearly, August 1. The history of St. German. He was a native of Gaul, about the year of our Lord 380, born of wealthy, rich, and Christian parents, by whom he was bred up and baptized into the Christian religion. After which he followed the study of the liberal arts and sciences, and so profited there in that he was generally noted for a very learned man. But that which made him most famous was his piety and virtue ; wherein he so far excelled most other men of his time, that he could not be at rest, or have peace in himself, till he made known his propensions to a religious course of life. Whereupon he was admitted into deacon's orders, then into priest's, and lastly advanced to the dignity of Bishop of Antiscidorum, or Auxerre, in France, anno Dom. 425. After he took upon him the office of a bishop, he dis charged the same with great justice and piety, admitting none into orders within his jurisdiction, but such as were men of great learning and sound faith, but especially such as were neither Arians nor Pelagians. For about that time the Christian church was grievously pestered with two heretics ; the one Arius, born and bred at Constanti nople; the other an inhabitant of Britain, viz. Pelagius."], [534, "64 ST. GERMAN S. But the doctrines of Pelagius manifesting themselves throughout this land, to the great disturbance of the ortho dox faith and churches thereof, after great heats and ani mosities between Catholics and heretics about those doc trines, it was at last agreed upon between those parties that a General Council of the Clergy in Britain should be con vened at St. Alban's, in Hertfordshire, and those tenets further examined and discussed. But the British Catholics, knowing the interest, skill, and subtlety of the heretics to be great, thought it not safe for religion, and the orthodox faith, in this convention to trust alone to their own skill and learning, therefore concluded on this expedient, viz. against the day of meeting to send for some foreign divines for their coadjutors or helpers in this controversy; and ac cordingly applied to St. German, Bishop of Antiscidorum aforesaid, or Auxerre, in Gallia, now France, a city situate upon the river Auxona, now called Le Disne, and Lupus, Bishop of Troyes, in that country, for their counsel and assistance, who gladly granted their request : and accord ingly against the day, and at the place appointed, met the British Clergy on both sides; where the tenets and doc trines being heard, and particularly examined, chiefly by the skill and learning of St. German, were all refuted and condemned, according to the sense ofthe General Councils, as impious and heretical, to the great satisfaction of the orthodox clergy. After this dispute and council ended, St. German, as a good bishop, resolved, though out of his country and dio cese, whilst he stayed here, to preach the Gospel publicly, and to that end caused a pulpit to be set up in an open place at St. Alban's, (so called from St. Alban, the Briton, martyred there under Dioclesian, anno Dom. 303,) an ciently Verulam; where on set days he preached to the multitude there assembled, and first began to handle the doctrine of Pelagius against original sin, taking for his text the words of St. John the Evangelist : \" If we say that we"], [535, "st. German's. 65 have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" Upon which subject he shewed that the doctrine of Pelagius was contrary to the writings and doctrines of Moses and the Prophets. These and the like words and preachings of St. German seemed so angelical and full of power to the Britons, that generally they were convinced of Pelagius's errors, and abandoned their former opinions ; and in testimony of their unfeigned respect and remembrance of him, in the very place where he preached at St. Alban's, they erected a cha- pel, and dedicated it to the honour of God, in the name of St. German ; which chapel was extant (and still bears his name) tempore James I. though misapplied to profane uses. (See Camden, in Hertfordshire.) After St. German had thus preached down Pelagianism at St. Alban's, he travelled through Britain, Wales, and Scotland, on the same account, as our chronologers tell us ; and that, in the place where Oxford stands, he preached six months against the heresies aforesaid. That he was in Cornwall upon the same account I doubt not, since there is still extant in this parish whereof I treat, a large church bearing his name. He was in Wales, for Camden, in Flintshire, informs us a field bearing his name, called Mars Garman, i. e. German's field, in memory of a battle there obtained by the Welch over the Picts, on the prayers of St. German, and by crying Flalle- lujah ! To him also is ascribed the building or augment ing Landaff cathedral there, and dedicating it to St. Delyan, if there be not a mistake in the chronology thereof, St. German, as appears to me, being dead before Delyan. That he preached in Scotland, is evident from his meet ing and converse with Patrick, born at Bluisdale, in that country, who became his disciple, and afterwards the apostle of Ireland. This priory-house, before its dissolution, was called Porth-Prior, or Port-Prior, synonymous words, signifying either the prior's creek, cove, or haven.

These gentlemen I take to be of Scots original, and so denominated from the local place of Eliot, near Dundee, in Scotland, and their descent of later time from the Eliots of Devonshire, Berkshire, or Cambridgeshire, of which last county one Sir Thomas Eliot, Knt. was Sheriff 24th Henry VIII. also in 36th. This gentleman wrote a book called Defensorium bonarum Mulierum, The Defence of good or virtuous Women. But that which made him most famous was, (to the disgrace of the critics and clergy that get their livings by the liberal arts and sciences, he being only a layman,) he wrote and composed the first Latin and English Dictionary that ever was seen in England, about the year 1540. Upon whose stock and foundation Bishop Cooper and others built and grafted all the Latin and English dictionaries now extant in Britain. He died in Suffolk, 1546; and upon the foundation, rules, and obser vation of this my Parochial History of Cornwall, it will be very easy for any other person to make a better and more perfect History thereof. Those gentlemen settled here about the middle of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and there ever since flourished in this place in genteel and worshipful degree, serving their king and country in the several capacities of Justices of the Peace and Members of Parliament for their Borough of St. German's; and amongst them, in particular, it were great injustice to forget the memory of that worthy patriot Sir John Eliot, Knt. for his bold asserting the prerogative and privilege of Parliament, the freedom and liberty of the subject, in the House of Commons, against the arbitrary and despotic power of the British Monarch, then exerted and setting up by the Attorney-general Noye and others, temp.

The town of St. German's lieth to the southward of Port Eliot, but adjoining with it, and between that and Cudden beck: but as Browne Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, has given a particular description of this town and parish, of which he was the most capable, having married his lady out of it, I shall here insert what he has said thereof: \" Its first return of M embers to serve in Parliament, was in the session held by proclamation in the 5th year of Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1562, at which time their having Representatives was questioned; however, Mr. Speaker declared in the House that the Lord Steward agreed that they (i. e. the two Members) should resort there with all"], [539, "st. German's. 69 convenient speed to show their letters patent, whereby they be returned. In this indenture the returning officer is called the Mayor, but in the next, and in all other records, the Portreeve; which magistrate is yearly nominated and chosen at the lord's court-leet, held about Michaelmas by his steward, who impannels a jury for that purpose. As to the choice of Members of Parliament, all the inhabitant householders have votes, that have lived a year within the borough, the bounds of which do not extend very far, and only comprehend about fifty or sixty houses lving near the church, and not the whole vill of St. German's, great part of which is without the borough, as is the rest of the parish. It is styled in some writings Cuddenbeck Bo- rough ; a privilege which it might perhaps have obtained from Walter Bishop of Exeter, temp. Henry III. when Penryn seems to have been made a borough ; and from this example the Prior, with the assistance of the Bishop, might also have dignified in like manner the vill of St. German's, though neither of them, anno 30th Eliz. when they certified respecting their liberties, and claims of privilege, as of markets, fairs, &c. styled this place otherwise than the ma- nor of St. German's; nor have I met with it under any other denomination than till Queen Elizabeth's time, or seen any record mentioning its incorporation, nor any other charter of privileges granted thereunto; though the inha- bitants have a tradition that they had an ancient charter, which was unfortunately stolen from them by a person im- prisoned by the Portreeve, who is by prescription bailiff of the town, and may make what house he pleases within the borough, his prison. As to a description of this borough, called by Carew ' a church town,' it mustereth, as that au thor tells us, sundry ruins, but little wealth.\" Browne Willis gives the following account of the Priory : \" After the removal of the bishoprics from Crediton and from this place to Exeter, A. D. 1050, Leofric, the first Bishop of Exeter, changed the seculars of this colle giate church, founded by King Athelstan, and endowed by"], [540, "70 st. German's. King Canute, into Black Canons, between whom, and his new-erected episcopal see, the manor of this town was divided ; and it stood upon that establishment at the time of the Norman invasion, as appears from Domesday Book, which informs us, that the manor or parish of St. German's consisted of twenty-four hides, whereof the Bishop of Exe ter had twelve, and the Canons of that place twelve also. What belonged to the Bishop was valued at 81s. per an num, and what belonged to the Canons at 100s. Domes day also shews us, that in this manor there was then a mar ket on the Lord's Day ; but it became reduced to nothing, by reason of that of the Earl of Morton's being very near, which I conceive might have heen kept at Trematon, that Earl having privilege of a market at his castle there. That such was the state of this town and parish at the time of the Conquest, is plain from the above-stated record ; and the division into two manors continues to the present day, the Bishop's moiety being held by lease for three lives by Edward Eliot, Esq. proprietor of the other manor ; whose predecessors have probably ever since the dissolution of the monasteries been farmers, or lessee tenants, to the See of Ex eter, by virtue of which lease, as this manor is vested in them, so the other, belonging to the Priory, has thus descended since the surrender thereof, dated March the 2d, anno 30th Henry VIII. when Robert Swimmer, the last Prior, with seven Monks, yielded up the same into the King's hands, who not long after, by letters patent dated March the 10th, anno regni 33, A.D. 1542, granted to John Champernoun, John Ridgeway, and Walter Smith. Among other lands, the site, 8cc. of this priory, upon partition, came to John Champernoun's share, whose heir sold it, about thirty or forty years afterwards, to Richard Eliot, Esq. my wife's ancestor, in which family both those manors yet continue : which place, soon after Mr. Eliot had made the purchase, was named Port Eliot, since when this appellation has so far prevailed that Port Eliot has been inserted in maps, as if it was a particular vill. This family flourished for eight"], [541, "st. German's. 71 or ten generations in Devonshire, before their transplanting themselves hither, and had matched into several consider able families in that county, as the Sigdons, Cotlands, Bon villes, Sumasters, Fitzes, Careswells, &c. Walter Eliot was returned among the gentlemen of Devonshire anno 1433, temp. Henry VI. And to this family, as it should seem by the arms, was allied Sir Richard Eliot, made by King Henry the Eighth one of the Justices of the King's Bench, who was, as I take it, father to the famous Sir Tho mas Eliot. Richard Eliot seated himself here, where he lived (as Carew tells us) in great hospitality. He left issue John Eliot, born and baptized here April 20, 1592. This John, A. D. 1607, became a gentleman commoner of Exe ter College, Oxford, which place leaving about two or three years after, he went to the Inns of Court, and May the 10th, 1618, received the honour of knighthood, and was all his lifetime after a member of the succeeding Par liaments, in one of which, 3d Charles I. he was chosen knight of the shire for Cornwall. He was a very plausible speaker in the House of Commons, as his speeches pub lished testify, but, being a virulent enemy to the Court, often suffered confinement, and died in custody in the Tower of London ; and, as appears by the inquisition on the 27th of November, 8th Charles I. A. D. 1632, leaving issue John, his son and heir, then twenty years old. This John was born at Port Eliot, and baptized October 18th, 1612, where he died and was buried March the 25th, 1685, leaving an only son, Daniel Eliot, my father-in-law^ who departed this life about the sixtieth year of his age, and was buried among his ancestors October 28th, 1702. This gentleman, in regard that he had only one daughter, named Katherine, bequeathed his estate, in order to keep up the name of his family, to Edward Eliot, grandson to Nicholas Eliot, fourth son to Sir John Eliot, Knight, aforesaid.\" Mr. Browne Willis then goes on to state respecting the remains of the monastery. \"The Priory fronts the river, now called, as above"], [542, "72 st. German's. noted, Port Eliot. It is a handsome large building, con taining several spacious rooms, and has a court before it> adorned with a strong pier by the present proprietor, Edward Eliot, Esq. who has much beautified the whole building.\" Since Mr. Willis wrote the above, almost the whole of the ancient building has been taken down, so that except the refectory, now called the gallery, very little remains. In the 26th year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, this place had an honour bestowed on it (little taken notice of, if not altogether forgotten), by being established by Act of Parliament the see of a suffragan bishop for the county of Cornwall, in the diocese of Exeter. The advowson of this church, together with the impro priate rectory, late the possessions of the priory, valued at 61/. 13s. 4c?. per annum, were granted by King Edward the Sixth to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, in whose hands they now continue. the editor. St. Germanus is among the most celebrated saints of the fourth and fifth centuries, having gained his reputation by furiously opposing the unpopular doctrines of Pelagius ; at the same time that he adopted all the brutalizing auste rities, which in those days conveyed power, influence, and reputation to all who practised them. Pelagius maintained that Almighty God has been pleased to bestow on mankind, from their births, power and incli nation to execute his will, and to render themselves ac ceptable in his sight; while the orthodox supported, on the contrary, a doctrine more analogous to the practices of earthly despots and tyrants, by declaring that such powers were capriciously given, by little and little and from time to time, branding their opponents with an accusation, well suited to the understanding of those from whom distinction could then be obtained, namely, that Pelagius set up man"], [543, "st. German's. 73 as independent and in opposition to God; forgetting or concealing that the free gift was and must have been the same in both cases, differing only in the manner after which it is bestowed. Perhaps the arbitrary disposition of fiefs, com mencing about that period, afforded an additional analogy for assimilating the practices in heaven to those on earth, while appeals to the capricious exercise of arbitrary power afforded evidently the most ample field for vehement de clamation. The saint is stated in his legend to have sprung from an illustrious family, and, while the appellation im plied a real office, to have been made Duke of a Roman province, and in that capacity to have been leader of the troops, with whom he obtained repeated victories, and ac quired the just reputation of an able warrior. He also excelled in the chace, but neither his skill in military stra tagems nor in the devices of the field, could protect him against falling into an ambuscade laid by St. Amator, Bi shop of Auxerre, who, having learnt from a dream, that the young Duke should succeed to the bishopric, enticed him into the church, and then, securing the doors and passages, imposed on him the tonsure, with the order of a deacon. Germanus appears to have submitted with perfect resigna tion to this important change in the whole tenor of his life, and adopting the line afterwards pursued by Sir Thomas of Canterbury in regard to spiritual matters, and that in re spect to his wife, which enrolled King Edward the Confes sor in the list of saints, he soon obtained a reputation so high as to point him out as the most proper person, first to suc ceed St. Amator, as Bishop of Auxerre, in fulfilment of the dream, and then to go on a spiritual crusade against the Pe lagians of Britain. He accordingly embarked, accompa nied by St. Lupus, in the midst of winter, and soon encoun- tered a violent storm, raised, it would seem, on purpose to evince the divine mission of these two saints, for, on their throwing some holy water into the sea, it immediately sub- sided. Saint Germanus and St. Lupus not only preached with"], [544, "74 ST. GERMAN'S. such power as to astonish and to convince whole congrega tions, too large for any building to contain, but they gave sight to the blind, cast out devils, and raised the dead. St. Germanus was even induced to assist the faithful in the way of his original profession ; for a Pagan army of Northmen and Picts invading the Christian provinces, the saint took the command of such persons as he found willing to defend their country, and having selected a place suited to his pur pose, either by naturally possessing an echo, or by receiv ing it miraculously from his prayers, he there awaited the enemy, and on their approach shouting three times Alle luiah, and the whole army joining with their utmost might, the divine sounds, repeated and enforced by the reverbera tion on all sides, so terrified the assailants as to drive them into immediate flight, with the casting away of their arms, who were, in consequence, readily and safely pursued with great slaughter, through the whole space separating them from their fleet, none being spared but such as had the grace instantly to acquiesce in a method of conversion so clear, so powerful, and so coercive. St. Germanus and St. Lupus soon afterwards left Bri tain, in the full confidence of having suppressed the heresy ; but so obstinate and perverse were the people, that it broke out with increased violence, the circumstance of Pelagius being their countryman having probably more weight with the inhabitants than the arguments on either side, as in modern times all German Protestants are followers of Lu ther, as those of France are invariably of Calvin. On receiving this intelligence, St. Germanus made a second voyage to Britain, armed with a small box of relics, suspended round his neck by a leathern string, which act ing in aid of his own inherent sanctity, produced a train of miracles more wonderful even than those of the first expe dition. Success of course attended him; and when the work of conversion was complete, he deposited the box of relics in the shrine of St. Alban, to be preserved for future use, if the seeds of heresy should again vegetate, taking in"], [545, "st. German's. 75 exchange some ashes of the British protomartyr. He then finally left Britain, returning to his diocese of Auxerre, on the confines of Burgundy ; but on the way he encoun tered a second Pagan army, employed by the Christian Emperor of Rome to ravage the saint's province, in re venge for some popular insurrection. The saint succeeded, however, in converting the general, with all his forces, and then proceeded to Ravenna, in Italy, to obtain a pardon for the offenders. In this he was also successful ; but hav ing now filled the measure of his earthly services, and, as was usual in such cases, having predicted the hour of his own dissolution, he expired at Ravenna, in the odour of sanctity, on the last day of July, A. D. 448. His remains were brought back to France, with all the honours due to the successful leader of any party, spiritual or temporal, and they were finely enshrined in the oratory of St. Mo rice, which he had founded at Auxerre, and where an abbey has since been built. Various places in Britain were dedicated to him as to their tutelar saint. Of these the abbey of Selby was on the largest scale, and the priory in Cornwall distinguished by his own name, held the next place; although a chapel near the church of St. Alban, where he had triumphed in a general disputation with the heretics, became most celebrated, multitudes flocking there, as to St. Mary of Walsingham, for remission of their sins. The ancient Priory of St. German's has again assumed a new form since the time of Mr. Tonkin, in consequence of Mr. Richard Eliot having greatly increased his fortune by marrying Harriet, daughter of James Craggs, Secretary of State in the time of King George the First. This gentle man, and still more his son, Mr. Edward Craggs Eliot, who obtained an hereditary seat in Parliament, after represent ing Cornwall in the House of Commons, added so much to the place, by enlarging the house, by embanking against the sea, and by laying out the grounds, as to make it one ofthe first among gentlemen's seats in the West of England. The"], [546, "76 st. German's. statute referred to by Mr. Tonkin, for conferring the ho nour of a suffragan see on this town, in the 26th Henry VIII. c. 14, passed in the year 1534, by which it is de clared that Thetford, Ipswich, Colchester, Dover, Guil ford, Southampton, Taunton, Shaftesbury, Molton, Marl borough, Bedford, Leicester, Gloucester, Shrewsbury, Bristow, Penrith, Bridgewater, Nottingham, Grantham, Hull, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Pereth, Berwick, St. Ger main's, and the Isle of Wight, shall be taken and accepted for sees of Bishops Suffragans, to be made in this Realm. This statute appears to have been very little if at all acted on; but two of the towns, Gloucester and Bristol, as is well known, became the seats of independent bishoprics. At Bake lived Mr. Walter Moyle, of whom Cornwall has reason to be proud. He represented Saltash in the reign of King William ; but, notwithstanding several suc cessful efforts in the House of Commons, Mr. Moyle re tired to his family seat, and past the remainder of his time in learned leisure, where he died in 1721, not having com pleted his fiftieth year. Most of his works were published separately, but in 1727 came out in London, \" Works of W. Moyle that were published by himself; with some ac count of his life and writings, by Anthony Hammond, Esq. 8vo.\" His works were principally : An Argument, showing that a Standing Army is incon sistent with a free Government. Translations from Xenophon. The Miracle of the Thundering Legion explained. A Charge to the Grand Jury at a Sessions in Liskeard. Letters to Dr. W. Musgrave, of Exeter, on subjects of Criticism and Antiquity. A Dissertation upon the Age of Philopatris, a Dialogue commonly attributed to Lucian. Letters to and from Mr. Moyle on various subjects.

Bake now belongs to Sir Joseph Copley, whose grand father, a brother's son of Mr. Walter Moyle, having mar ried the heiress of Copley, of Sprotborough, in Yorkshire, assumed her name. Aldwinnick is the property of Mr. Charles Trelawny, son of Mr. Edward Trelawny, who acquired it under the will of Mr. Charles Trelawny, who died in 1764, the last male descendant of their branch of the family. Mr. Ed ward Trelawny's original name was Stephens. Catchfrench was till lately the residence of Mr. Francis Glanville, Member some time for Plymouth. This gen tleman's ancestors purchased Catchfrench from the Fortes cues more than a century ago. Mr. Glanville has given it up to his son, and on quitting the county he has carried with him the regret of every one in it. Much obloquy having been cast upon Sir John Eliot, by a misrepresentation on the part of his political adversaries, of an affair in which sudden passion very probably caused him to act in a manner different from what would have been his conduct under other circumstances, I will add a nar rative of the occurrence, taken from Lord Nugent's Life of Hampden. \" In a letter in the possession of Miss Aikin, written by an ancestor of one of the most respectable families in De vonshire, the cause and course of the quarrel are given, as described by the daughter of Mr. Moyle himself, a witness not likely to be unjustly partial to Sir John Eliot. \" Mr. Moyle having acquainted Sir John Eliot's father with some extravagancies in his son's expenses, and this being reported with some aggravating circumstances, young Eliot went hastily to Mr. Moyle's house, and re monstrated. \" What words passed she knew not ; but Eliot drew his sword, and wounded Mr. Moyle in his side.

Mr. Moyle was so intirely recon ciled to him, that no person in his time held him in higher esteem.\" The editor cannot induce himself to believe that an English gentleman, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr in the cause of national freedom, could have formed and en deavoured to execute a plan for deliberate assassination; he is, moreover, unwilling perhaps to believe it of one who married the heiress of his own paternal family. It would be unfair, however, not to state that Mr. D'lsraeli,* one of the most intelligent and candid of modern writers, and of the highest authority, has found in the course of his miscellaneous researches, various documents placing this transaction in a point of view much less favourable to Sir John Eliot, than would be inferred from Lord Nugent's account of it. The editor, however, continues to hope that these documents are coloured, at least, by the party spirit of times immediately preceding civil war, when all oc currences, private as well as public, receive their tincture from contending factions.

TONKIN. In this parish stands Godolphin, or Godolphin-Ball, from whence the lands thereof were denominated de Go dolphin ; who for many ages have had a considerable aug mentation of their paternal estate by the casualties of tin from thence issuing. The same is a barren mountain, of pretty large extent and great height; and, although wrought for tin at the least during three hundred years, seems still, like the widow's cruise of oil and barrel of meal, to increase in the using, for, notwithstanding the incredible quantities of tin that have been taken thence in former ages, it still affords employment, and pays the wages, with"], [551, "GERMOE. 81 some overplus, of at least three hundred men throughout the year. The name of diis parish is derived from its patron St. Germow, or Germach, said to be an Irish king, who came over with St. Breage. St. Germow is there buried, and his tomb or chair is still to be seen in the churchyard. the editor. Mr. Hals has given the history of St. Gordian at very great length, to whom, without the slighest authority, he assumes this church and parish to have been dedicated. I have omitted the whole, as entirely unconnected with Corn wall, and because the very existence of such a saint is at the least doubtful. The writers of legends now content themselves with stating that some one of that name was beheaded at Rome in the year 362, as appears from the ancient Martyrologies ; that his body lay many centuries in a cave, together with the remains of St. Epimachus, brought there from Alexandria, and that both relics are preserved in the Benedictine Abbey of Kempton, in the diocese of Ansbury. The tradition of St. Germoe having been a king in his native country, is cherished by the inhabitants up to the present time, and they point to his tomb or shrine in the churchyard, with an evident feeling of their being elevated by his dignity. But, on whatever grounds the ancient claims of this parish may rest to a canonized or to a royal patron, the village of Bojil has in modern times bestowed more real honour on the whole district, than could be derived from regal missionaries or from legendary saints. In the parish register of Breage may be seen the follow ing entry : \" William, the son of William Lemon, of Germo, was baptized the 15th day of November, 1696.\" I have endeavoured, but without much success, to collect VOL. II. G"], [552, "82 GERMOE. information respecting this very extraordinary man. It appears that his father and mother, whose maiden name was Rodda, were in a situation of life raised above the common level, and that they bestowed on their son the best education easily attainable, who on his part became emi nently distinguished among his companions. If young Lemon ever, therefore, employed himself in executing the inferior labours usually performed by mining boys, as some have alleged with the view of increasing the wonder of his subsequent progress, and others impelled by less laudable motives, it is clear that they must have been under taken from a desire of making himself practically acquainted with all the details of perhaps the most delicate operations in metallurgy. His bodily strength and firmness of mind seem to have been commensurate with those abilities, which displayed themselves most conspicuously in after life. Within my recollection, the people of Breage and Germoe were fond of relating that Squire Lemon in his youth made the fore most link of a living chain, which, connected only by the grasp of their hands, extended itself into a tremendous surf, and rescued various human beings from a watery grave. At a very early age, Mr. Lemon became one of the ma nagers of a tin-smelting house at Chiandower, near Pen zance; and the career which he pursued with so much ability and success, was traced for him at this place. The ancient mining of Cornwall, like that of Banka in the present day, had been confined for a long succession of ages to merely collecting diluvial deposits of tin ore, which, from its great specific gravity, is always found beneath every other debrit, and immediately incumbent on the solid rock, or unmoved strata, provincially called \" the Fast.\" As the first operation invariably consists in washing away the lighter ingredients, by agitating the whole in streams, which never fail of gliding through the vallies where alone these deposits are found, the name \"stream-work\" has"], [553, "83 GERMOE. been adopted, to distinguish these sources of tin from mines which descend on the lodes themselves. Mines invariably grew out of the stream-works, but with a progress so very slow as scarcely to be imagined by per sons conversant only with the rapid improvements of mo dern times. Pits were at first sunk on the backs of lodes, till the presence of water impeded the work. Shallow adits, or drains, were obviously used in favourable situations, and the windlass, with its bucket and rope, must be of great antiquity. To this succeeded the rack and chain pump, identical with those still used in large ships ; but the span beam and cage, moving on a perpendicular axis, by which the labour of horses became applicable to whatrhad previ ously been done by the human arm, are so very modern, that the Editor remembers a carpenter who used to boast that he assisted in making the first whim ever seen westward Hayle. A new era had, however, now commenced. The steam engine, which consists essentially in a piston alternately sliding through a cylindrical vessel, invented by Mr. New comen, of Dartmouth, had been used at least on one mine, called the Great Work, in Breage, when Mr. Lemon came forward, gifted with the ability and the energy which en abled him to anticipate, by nearly half a century, everything that could add to the wealth and to the prosperity of his native county. Mr. Lemon first associating himself with Mr. George Blewett, of Marasion, and with Mr. Dewen, commenced working a mine on a farm called Trowel, in the parish of Luddvan, the property of Lord Godolphin, and named Whele Fortune, where the second steam-engine was used. Capital was of course requisite for the undertaking, and that is said to have been supplied to Mr. Lemon by his marriage. It appears, from the register of Gulval, that \" William Lemon and Isabel Vibert were married April the 22d, 1724.\" The Viberts were among what are termed the good linef-in Gulval parish, and Mrs. Lemon had re- 2 G"], [554, "84 GERMOW. cently succeeded by will to the property of Mrs. Elizabeth Noles her godmother, and probably relation, who had acquired a fortune by some business at Chiandower. But fortune, except perhaps for its timely supply of capital, was the least of Mrs. Lemon's recommendations ; uniform report has represented her as entirely worthy of the very extraordinary person to whom she was united. Mr. Lemon is said to have gained from Whele Fortune ten thousand pounds; and, thus enabled to execute more extensive plans, he removed to Truro, and commenced working the great Gwennap mines, on a scale never wit nessed before, and perhaps never contemplated, in Corn wall. Ca\u00c6on Adit was either actually commenced, or at the least was effectually prosecuted, by Mr. Lemon; a work unrivalled for extent or for utility in the mines of England, and his exertions increasing as his means en larged, Mr. Lemon soon became the principal merchant and tin-smelter of Cornwall. But the energies of his mind were not limited to these undertakings, great as they were ; he cultivated a taste for literature, and, what is extremely unusual, acquired, amidst business, and at a middle age, the power of reading the Classic authors in their original language. In the year 1742, we find his name in the hst of Sheriffs. He became one of the magistrates of Truro, and might have represented the borough in Parliament. He obtained from Government a drawback of the duty on coal used in mines, when Sir Robert Walpole, then at the head of public affairs, complimented him on the clear and able manner in which he had made every statement ; and a present of silver plate from Frederick Prince of Wales, as Duke of Cornwall, is preserved in his family. About the same time he was mainly distinguished as \" the great Mr. Lemon ;\" but, above all, so strongly were the impressions received of his abilities, his exertions, and general merit, that a progress so rapid and unexampled does not appear to have excited envy, or any of those bad passions which usually alloy the enjoyments of prosperity."], [555, "85 GERMOW. Mr. and Mrs. Lemon had but one son, and no daugh ters. Mr. William Lemon, Jun. married Ann, only daughter of Mr. John Willyams, of CawJwlon, near St. Colomb, and sister of the late Mr. John Oliver Willyams, many years Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. He died at an early period of life, and several years before his father, who lived to the 25th of March 1760, and is buried in Truro church, where he had built by far the largest and most decorated house in the town. He had also purchased and improved Carclew, since become the family seat. The younger Mr. William Lemon left two sons and a daughter. The elder of the sons, Sir William, represented the County of Cornwall in Parliament during fifty years, and commanded the regiment of militia. The second son, John, became a Colonel in the Guards, represented Truro, and commanded the Miners' Militia. The daughter mar ried Mr. John Buller, of Morval, near Looe. As instances of the respect paid to the commanding genius of Mr. Lemon, the people of Truro are said to have drawn back from their doors or windows as he passed through the street. And the Rev. Samuel Walker, a re spectable although a fanatical clergyman, exhorting the children to be circumspect in the presence of Almighty God, incautiously added, \" Only think, my dear children, how careful you would be if Mr. Lemon were looking upon you.\" The parish of Germow measures 1,062 statute acres.

His festival is kept on the third of June, and he is said to have died in the year 662. Such were the heroes of those days, and therefore he may possibly have been selected as patron of this church. Mr. Lysons states that Treveeg, formerly a seat of the Yeos, is now the property of Lord Eliot, and that the"], [557, "87 ST.

The Yeos were persons of consequence in the north of Cornwall and of Devonshire ; they bore arms, Argent, a chevron Gules, between three birds. Mr. Lysons further states that the manor of St. Gennis was for some time the property of Treise, from whom it passed by marriage to Morshead. It must since have been sold in the general wreck of that family. Lord Rolle has also a manor in this parish. And an other manor, called Treworgy, (a name common in Corn wall, and meaning a house or village on a stream,) be longed to the Priory of Canons of the Order of St. Augus tine, founded at Launceston by William Warlewast, Bishop of Exeter from 1150 to 1159, in the time of King Stephen and of Henry the 2d. Treworgy appears among the lands of this priory in the roll of 31 Henry VIII. preserved in the Augmentation Office ; where it is stated as then paying the following sums, \u00a3A. 13s. Id., \u00a33. 17s., and 6s. 8d.

He is buried in the chancel of this church, where some verses to his memory begin with these lines : In war and peace I bore command, Both gown and sword I wore. Henry Braddon, his son, or grandson, has the following verses : ' In peace I lived, and in peace did die, And now translated am to peace on high ; Where I in peace perpetual shall remain, Until the Prince of Peace return again.

The whole of this parish is situated on the massive and schistose varieties of Dunstone, which are so prevalent in the northern parts of Cornwall and Devon. The Dun stone is in general very silicious, and it thus constitutes high and barren hills. A very curious variety of this rock occurs at Tresparret Down. It is in a state of decomposi tion, but when it is broken numerous hard rounded nodules fall out, having uniformly small crystals of pyrites in their centres. The same rock, in an unaltered state, forms the cliff on the left side of Crackington Cave, near the church, where it is inclined at an angle of 40\u00b0, having the entire surface covered with projecting nodules, which give it a blistered appearance not unlike that of h\u00e6matites.

How these names of Giant or Golant prevailed over that of St. Sampson I am not able to determine, unless perhaps it was the primitive name thereof before the parish church was erected, consecrated, and endowed to God under the name of St. Sampson. For in Cardinal Wolsey's Inqui sition, and in Carew's Survey, it is called St. Sampson. The name Golant is obviously compounded of Gol, holy, and of Ian, a church. (Mr. Whitaker remarks that Y-Gol, by the Holy One, is still an oath in Cornwall.) THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has given a very long and uninteresting ac count of St. Sampson, the patron saint of Golant, involving a dissertation on the antiquity of archbishops. He is reported to have commenced his ecclesiastical ca reer by the practice of ascetic observances, in due time he became the chief of a monastic institution, from whence he was taken to be Archbishop of York ; but the north of England being at that time ravaged by the northern pirates, he was driven from thence, and going over into Brittany he founded a monastery at Dal, and became the first Bishop of that place, where a see was created at his request by Pope Pelegius the First, who honoured him moreover personally with the pallium or pale. He was present at the Second Council of Paris, held in 557, and died about the year 564. His remains were enshrined at Dal, but when the Normans began in the tenth century to invade and pillage Neustria, these barbarians, equally hos-"], [561, "GLANT 91 tile to the saint alive or dead, obliged his brethren to re move the relics to Paris, where they are supposed to have been preserved up to the period ofthe great revolution. Penquite was acquired by purchase about the beginning or towards the middle of last century from the Prestwoods, by Mr. Rashleigh, of Menwhilly, by whom a perpetual lease was soon after granted in favour of a relation, which has since passed through various hands. Mr. Lysons says that the manor of Lentyon in this parish, belonged to the Montacutes Earls of Salisbury. It appears- from Dugdale's Baronage that this property was seized by king Henry VIIL, on his judicial murder of the last Plantagenet, Margaret Countess of Salisbury. It now belongs to Mr. William Rashleigh, who is impropriator of the great and small tithes, and appoints the perpetual curate, in right of the monastery of Tywardreth. A castle is said to have belonged to this manor, but no traces of it remain; the appellation seems indeed to have been very loosely applied in the latter part of our feudal times, so as frequently to indicate no more than the resi dence of a chief. The village round the church, or, according to the ex pression used in Cornwall, \" the church town,\" is always called Golant. The houses are situated in a romantic cross valley, nearly where it terminates in Fowey River. The inhabitants boast that in this village was established the first boarding-school for young ladies that appeared in Cornwall, and they call the attention of visitors to these peculiarities connected with this church : \u2014 \" That it has a fire-place within it ; that a well of water flows over in the porch; and that a tree in the churchyard o'ertops the tower.\" This parish measures 1340 statute acres.

Those gentlemen, from living at Carveth, or Carverth, in Mabe, were transnominated from Thorns to Carverth; as another family of those Thomses, from living at Carnsew, in the said parish, were transnominated to Carnsew ; and there are some deeds yet extant dated tempore Henry VIII. which will evidence the truth of this fact, as Mr. Carverth told me. Between the parishes of Budock and Gluvias, on a pro montory of land shooting into the sea creek of Falmouth harbour, between two vales and hills, where the tide daily makes its flux and reflux, stands the ancient borough of Penrin, or Penryn, a name given and taken from the natural circumstances of the place; and by the name of Penrin it was taxed as the voke lands of a considerable manor in Domesday Roll, 20 William I. 1087. (See Brin, Bryn, in Withell.) This place I take to be the Oitpivvfi (Ocrinum) of Pto lemy. The town was a privileged manor, with a court leet, before the Norman Conquest; and in the year 1230"], [565, "GLUVIAS. 95 King Henry III. granted a charter to William Brewer, Bishop of Exeter, then lord thereof, as his successors still are, in right of the bishopric of Bodman, or Cornwall, long before annexed to Exeter. (See more in Lanwhitton.) It was also incorporated by King James I. by another charter, consisting of a Mayor, Recorder, and Portreeve, eleven Magistrates, and twelve Assistants ; with liberty to send two of its members to sit in the Commons' House of Parliament, to be elected by the majority of those that are freemen, and pay rates and taxes. It is also, amongst many other things, appurtenanced with markets weekly, upon Wednesdays and Saturdays; fairs on May 1, July 7, December 21 ; and of old had free warren in all the King's lands. The arms of this town are a Saracen's head couped at the shoulder, and crowned, or environed, with a laurel. The precept from the Sheriff on the Parliament writ, as also to remove an action at law depending in this leet to a superior court, must be thus directed: \" Majori et Burgensibus Burgi sui de Penrin in Comitatu Cornubi\u00e6 salutem,\" otherwise, \" Proposito, Ballivis, et Burgensibus Burgi sui de Penryn ;\" and to remove an action from the court leet of Penryn foreign : \" Senescallo et Ballivis manerij de Penrin forreigne salutem.\" But, alas ! notwithstanding all its privileges, our Cornish historian, Mr. Carew, in his time, tells us that on the top fo a creek Penrin town hath taken up its seat; rather passable than notable for wealth, buildings, or inhabitants. Though now, tempore Charles II. I take it to be much altered for the better in these particulars, and to be parallel with, or equal therein, with any other town in Cornwall. And, moreover, I look upon it as the most commodious, pleasantly situated, and healthful borough within that pro vince, it being situated upon a hill, and having continually passing through its streets a useful river of water, and through the gardens and orchards of the town, behind the street-houses on each side, pass two considerable mill-leats, or rivers of water, met daily by the flux and reflux of the sea."], [566, "96 GLUVIAS. Where, on the south of this town, on one of those rivers, Walter Brounscomb, Bishop of Exeter, 1260, at a place called Glasnith, or green-ford, so named from the estuaries, or ebbing and flowing of the sea under it, founded and endowed a collegiate church of Black Canons, or Canons Augustine, that could not marry wives, consisting of twelve prebends and a dean ; \" Clerici tresdecem, person\u00e6 dis cret\u00e6,\" are the very words of the leger book of its foun dation ; and then endowed and confirmed all by a charter in these words, as translated from Bishop Brounscomb's ori ginal Latin. \" To give to God, the blessed Virgin Mary, and St. Thomas of Canterbury, in Budock, Penryn, and Glasnith College, and his thirteen canonical brothers and their o t successors, all lands, woods, meadows, waters, pastures, mills, laws, rents, and courts, and all things to the same pertaining, to possess, have, hold, and enjoy for ever. This agrees with the register, Robert Michell, Register, 1611.\" Afterwards this collegiate church, thus founded and en- dowed, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, received a greater augmentation of wealth, lands, aud revenues from John Grandison, Bishop of Exeter, 1358, who had persuaded all rich priests of his diocese to make him his heir and exe- cutor, in order to build and endow churches with their riches; which trust, in a great measure, he performed to his lasting credit and renown ; so that at length, amongst others, this collegiate church's yearly revenues, at the sup- pression, 26 Henry VIII. was valued at 205/. 10s. Qd. according to Speed and Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum, now worth 1200/. This collegiate church is now entirely demolished.

The chief inhabitants of this town of Penrin are Mr. Hallamore, Mr. Worth, Mr. Hearle, Mr. Kempe, Mr. Bloyse, Mr. Melhuish, Mr. Vellhuish. The Lady Jane Killigrew, of Arwinick (see Falmouth), for some protection and favour shewn her in her troubles by the Mayor of this town, gave a silver cup and cover to the Mayor of this town and his successors for ever, con taining about three quarts, and about 12/. value, whereon is this inscription : \" From Mayor to M ayor, to the town of Penryn, when they received me in great misery.

After transcribing, with little variation, what has been stated from Mr. Hals, Mr. Tonkins adds, Enis, in this parish, gave name to an old family of gentlemen from thence, denominated de Enis; that is to say, of this island ; for innis, ennis, enys, signify in Cor nish, an island, and also a tongue of land where two rivers meet. John Enys, Esq. acquired a great flow of wealth by his^ marriage with Ann, only daughter of Mr. Henry Grey*. of Truro. His son, Samuel Enys, is the present possessor of the estate ; he married Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Willis, of London, merchant, and has lately succeeded to a considerable fortune by the decease of her two brothers, Sir Thomas and Sir William Willis, of Fen Ditton, in Cam- bridgeshire, Baronets, the last in the year 1733. This gentleman is in the commission of the Peace, and was Sheriff of Cornwall, 8 Anne, A.D. 1709. He has ex- pended large sums of money in the improvement of his seat, as well by enlarging the house as by making beautiful gardens. VOL. II. H"], [568, "98 GLUVIAS.

The arms of Pendarves are, Sab. a falcon rising Arg. between three mullets, Or. I cannot refrain from making some remarks on Alexander Pendarves, Esq. the last of this family. He was Surveyor-general of the Crown and Duchy lands in Cornwall to Queen Anne, and a Member of Parliament the greatest part of his life. He married Mary, eldest daughter of the Honourable Bernard Grenville, brother of Lord Lansdowne, a beautiful young lady, but she did not bring him any children. He died in 1726, very suddenly, at his house in London, being then a burgess for the town of Launceston. His death was a great surprise to all his friends, and especially to me, with whom I had taken a hearty breakfast that very morning at my aunt Vincent's, at Chelsea. I must add, that on the Sun day before he and I bore up the pall to John Goodall, of Fowey, Esq. buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster; and that on the Sunday fortnight after, I had the misfortune to bear up his in St. Mary's, Savoy. He was the last male of the family of Pendarves in this place, which, with the rest of his property, has devolved to his niece, Mary, the only daughter and heiress of his brother, John Pendarves, clerk, Rector of Drews Teignton, in Devonshire, and relict of Francis Basset, of Tehidy, Esq. ; and this lady is now the possessor, paying an annuity of \u00a3.400 a-year to her uncle's widow. But before I leave this place I must not forget to give diis just character of my deceased friend, with whom I had the honour to serve as burgess for Helston, in Queen Anne's last Parliament; that for good humour, good sense, for a true and sincere adherence to the interests of his country, and for a harmless merry dis-"], [569, "GLUVIAS.

Mr. Hals gives a very improbable etymology for the name of this parish, deriving it from the Cornish verb, glewas, to hear, which he quotes from the 12th stanza of Mount Calvary. An ger a Du maga del wrei neb vynno tro glewas. Lavar Du maga del wrei neb a vynno y glewas. The word (of) God feed so will do (he) who is willing to hear, The first line is transcribed from Mr. Hals, the second is the line as it stands in the MS. from which the editor of this work has printed Mount Calvary. The Editor has not been able to find any traces of St. Ghivias, but these may have easily disappeared amidst the throng of our provincial hierarchy. The borough of Penryn, with enlarged limits, has been united with Falmouth in sending two Members to Parlia- ment under the constitution of 1832. Of the principal inhabitants noticed by Mr. Hals, the Hearles had risen into most importance. They were the younger branch of a family said to have migrated into Cornwall, and to have settled at Prideaux, in Luxuliin, and afterwards at Trelawn, in Pelynt, usually written Trelawny, since it was purchased by a gentleman of that name. The last Mr. Hearle, of Penryn, married the heiress of Paynter, of Trelisick, in St. Erth ; and having lost an only son, his daughters became coheiresses, who married Mr. llodd, of Trebartha, the Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne, and Captain Wallis ofthe R. N.

Samuel Enys represented Penryn in the first Parliament of Charles II. and they appear in every page of our list of Sheriffs. Mr. Enys has built an excellent new house on the foundation of the old ; and very recently (1834) he has married Catherine Gilbert, the Editor's eldest daughter. The manor of Cosawis, or Gosose, was a part of the large possessions taken from the Bodrugons by Henry VII. and given by him to Sir Richard Edgecumbe, whose de scendant, Lord Mount Edgecumbe, parted with it to the late Sir William Lemon. But a farm called Bohelland has for two centuries con tinued to excite great curiosity and attention on account, of its having been the place where events occurred in real life more horrible than the most heated and gloomy ima gination could well invent. Mr. Lysons refers to a small pamphlet of eight leaves, printed in black letter, and ac companied with several wood-cuts, entitled, \" News from Perin, in Cornwall, of a most bloody and unexampled Murder, &c.\" but not having given any clue for finding it, the Editor has examined several public libraries without success. The following narrative has, however, been ex tracted from a work entitled \" The Reign and Death of King James, of Great Britain :\" \" He had been blessed with ample possessions and fruitful issue, unhappy only in a younger son, who taking liberty from his father's bounty, and with a crew of like condition, that wearied on land, they went roving to sea, and in a small vessel southward, took boot from all they could ma- ster, and so increasing force and wealth, ventured on a Turk's man in the Streights; but by mischance their own powder fired themselves, and our gallant, trusting to his skil- ful swimming, got on shore upon Rhodes, with the best of his jewels about him ; where offering some to sale to a Jew, who knew them to be the Governor's of Algier, he was appre- hended, and, as a pirate, sentenced to the gallies among other Christians, whose miserable slavery made them all"], [571, "101 GLUVIAS. studious of freedom, and with wit and valour took oppor tunity and means to murther some officers, got on board of an English ship, and came safe to London ; where his misery, and some skill, made him servant to a surgeon, and sudden preferment to the East Indies. There, by this means he got money ; with which returning back, he de signed himself for his native county, Cornwall. And in a small ship from London, sailing to the west, was cast away upon that coast. But his excellent skill in swimming, and former fate to boot, brought him safe to shore ; where, since his fifteen years' absence, his father's former fortunes much decayed, now retired him not far off to a country habitation, in debt and danger. \" His sister he finds married to a mercer, a meaner match than her birth promised. To her, at first, he appears a poor stranger, but in private reveals himself, and withall what jewels and gold he had concealed in a bow-case about him ; and concluded that the next day he intended to appear to his parents, and to keep his disguise till she and her husband should meet, and make their common joy complete. \" Being come to his parents, his humble behaviour, suit- able to his suit of clothes, melted the old couple to so much compassion as to give him covering from the cold season under their outward roof, and by degrees his tra- velling tales, told with passion to the aged people, made him their guest so long by the kitchen fire, that the hus- band took leave and went to bed. And soon after his true stories working compassion in the weaker vessel, she wept, and so did he ; but compassionate of her tears, he com- forted her with a piece of gold, which gave assurance that he deserved a lodging, to which she brought him; and being in bed, shewed her his girdled wealth, which he said was sufficient to relieve her husband's wants, and to spare for himself, and being very weary fell fast asleep. \" The wife, tempted with the golden bait of what she had, and eager of enjoying all, awakened her husband with"], [572, "102 GLUVIAS. this news, and her contrivance what to do; and though with horrid apprehension he oft refused, yet her puling fondness (Eve's enchantments) moved him to consent, and rise to be master of all, and both of them to murder the man, which instantly they did ; covering the corpse under the clothes till opportunity to convey it out of the way. \" The early morning hastens the sister to her father's house, where she, with signs of joy, enquires for a sailor that should lodge there the last night; the parents slightly denied to have seen any such, until she told them that he was her brother, her lost brother ; by that assured scar upon his arm, cut with a sword in his youth she knew him; and were all resolved this morning to meet there and be merry. \" The father hastily runs up, finds the mark, and with horrid regret of this monstrous murther of his own son, with the same knife cuts his own throat. \" The wife went up to consult with him, where in a most strange manner beholding them both in blood, wild and o o t aghast, with the instrument at hand, readily rips herself up, and perishes on the same spot. \" The daughter, doubting the delay of their absence, searches for them all, whom she found out too soon ; with the sad sight of this scene, and being overcome with horror O t o and amaze of this deluge of destruction, she sank down and died; the fatal end of that family. \" The truth of which was frequently known, and flew to court in this guise ; but the imprinted relation conceals their names, in favour to some neighbour of repute and kin to that family. The same sense makes me therein silent also.\" These dreadful events have been wrought into a drama by Lillo, the author of George Barnwell; and if terror and pity form the essential bases of tragedy, the \" Fatal Curiosity\" is built on a most ample foundation ; the sister, of course, changes her character to heighten the effect, but in other"], [573, "GLUVIAS. 103 respects the play scarcely differs from the actual course of events. The celebrated Mr. Harris of Salisbury, has given the following account of this drama in his last work, entitled, \" Philological Inquiries.\" \"A long lost son, returning home unexpectedly, finds his parents alive, but perishing with indigence. \"The young man, whom from his long absence his parents never expected, discovers himself to an amiable friend, his long-loved Charlotte, and with her concerts the manner how to discover himself to his parents. \" It is agreed that he should go to their house, and there remain unknown till Charlotte should arrive and make the happy discovery. \" He goes thither accordingly, and having by a letter of Charlotte's been admitted, converses, though unknown, both with father and mother, and beholds their misery with filial affection ; complains, at length, he was fatigued (which, in fact, he really was), and begs he may be ad mitted for a while to repose. Retiring he delivers a casket to his mother, and tells her it is a deposit she must guard till he awake. \" Curiosity tempts her to open the casket, when she is dazzled with the splendour of innumerable jewels. Objects so alluring suggest bad ideas; and poverty soon gives to those ideas a sanction. Black as they are, she commu nicates them to her hushand ; who, at first reluctant, is at length persuaded, and for the sake of the jewels stabs the stranger while he sleeps. \" The fatal murder is perpetrating, or at least but barely perpetrated, when Charlotte arrives, full of joy, to inform them that the stranger within their walls was their long-lost son. \" What a discovery ? What a revolution ? How irre sistibly are the tragic passions of terror and pity excited i \" It is no small praise to this affecting fable that it so much resembles the \u0152dipus Tyrannus of Sophocles.

It is a very curious circumstance that the name of these wretched people, having been kept back at first from com passion towards their relatives, it is now actually unknown. This parish has been peculiarly fortunate in its succession of clergymen. The Rev. John Penrose, who died in 1776, after being thirty-five years Vicar, has left the reputation of learning, of piety, and of all the virtues which adorn a clergyman. Mr. Temple bore a very high reputation as a man of letters; Mr. Howell was universally esteemed; and the present vicar, Mr. Sheepshanks, ranked in the first lists of science and of literature at Cambridge, and became a distinguished tutor in a college, which continues to support the rank bestowed upon it by the greatest of philosophers. The town, lying on the back of a sharp ridge of land dividing two deep vallies, has great beauty of situation, and deserves in other respects the praises bestowed by Mr. Tonkin. To travellers, however, all the circumstances are quite different ; the main street descending with the ridge is scarcely safe for carriages ; and the great road from London through Truro to Falmouth, passing directly across the ridge, has to go up and then down through streets so steep and narrow, and in parts so turned, as to make the safe-passage of the mail-coach a matter of wonder; these defects have been, however, completely remedied by a road carried round the point and accommodated with a draw bridge ; thus reducing the road to a level, and preserving the communication by water ; this improvement was made about the year 1830."], [575, "GORAN 105 This parish measures 2,271 statute acres.

He was knighted by King Edward IV. or King Richard III. by the name of Sir Henry Bodrigham ; who siding with King Richard III. at the battle of Bosworth Field (where he, the said King Richard, was slain by the Earl of Richmond's sol- diers), he was therefore, with many others, attainted of treason against King Henry VII. ; and in order to shun justice he made his escape after the battle aforesaid, and secretly repaired to this place, where he was kept close for a season, but not so private but King Henry's officers got notice thereof, and at an appointed time beset the same in quest of him; which he understanding, by a back- door fled from thence, and ran down the hills to the sea cliff near the same, the officers pursuing so quick after him that he could not possibly make his escape. As soon therefore as he came to the cliffs about a hundred feet high, he leaped down into the sea, upon the little grassy island there, without much hurt or damage; where in- stantly a boat which he had prepared in the cove, attended him there, which transported him to a ship that carried him into France. Which astonishing fact, and place, is to this day well known and remembered by the name of Harry Bodrigan's leap, or jump.

Tradition tells us that there was great discord and vari ance between the families of Bodrigan and the knightly family of the Haleps of Lammoran, either upon account of private affronts or grudges, or upon the different interests or factions, and wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, wherein they were associated and engaged against each other, so that as often as they met between them selves and servants some combat or battle ensued, whereby blood was shed and the peace broken ; and they often came to each other's gates armed in defiance on horseback. At Tre-garden lived John de Tregarthyn, temp. Ed ward I. how long before I know not ; after which his posterity in this place married with the great inheritrixes of Pever,- Chamberlayne, and Hendower, of Court, in Branell, by which last, by the Cornwalls of that place, they were lineally descended from Richard Earl of Corn wall, King of the Romans, by his concubine, Joan de Valletort, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston. (Vide St. Stephen's.) Certainly this was an ancient, rich, and famous family in those parts, for it appears by their seats, or pews, in Goran church, they had the precedence or right hand of the seats pertaining to the great family of Bodrigan, as is yet to be seen. Thomas Tregarthyn, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall, 7 Henry VII. 1492, who married Hendower aforesaid, and removed to Court, in St. Stephen's, in Branell. He had issue by her, John Tregarthyn, Esq. and two daughters ; Margaret, the eldest, married to Richard Whiteleigh, of Efford, in Devon, Esq. Sheriff of that county 16th Henry VII. ; from whose two daughters and heirs the Grenvilles of Stowe, and the Halses late of Efford aforesaid, and Fentongallan, in Corn wall, are lineally descended. Catherine, the second daughter of Thomas Tregarthyn, was married to John Carmenow, of Fentongollan, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall 5th Henry VIII. whose posterity are extinct."], [580, "110 GORAN John Tregarthyn, Esq. aforesaid, son of Thomas, married Jane, daughter of Thomas Trethyrfe, Esq. and had issue by her four daughters that became his heirs ; Mary married to Degory Grenvill, cf Penheale, Esq. ; Jane to Trip cony, who passed those lands to Richard Trevanion, Esq. (ancestor to Richard Trevanion, now in possession of this place) ; Margaret, married to George Tanner, of Cullumb ton, Esq. to whose share and partage the manor of Court and Branell, in St. Stephen's, fell; Joan married to John Kellaway, of Egge, in Devon, Esq.; after his death to Wadham of Merryfield, in Somerset, as appears from her tombstone in Branscombe church, Devonshire, where is to be read and seen those words : \" Here lyeth the body of a virtuous and ancient gentle woman, descended of the ancient house of the Plantagenets, some time of Cornwall, namely, Joan, one of the daughters and coheirs of JohnTregarthin, of Tregarthyn, Esq.; she was first married to John Kellaway, Esq. who had by her much issue. After his death she was married to John Wadham, of Meryfield, in the county cf Somerset, Esq. by whom she had children. She lived a virtuous and godly life, and died in an honourable age, in the year of our Lord 1581.\" Now because this dark phrase, \" descended of the house of the Plantagenets,\" needs a clavis to unlock it, let the reader view the history of St. Stephen's in Branell, and St. Stephen's by Saltash, and he shall find one that will do it effectually. The arms of Tregarthin, whose name and whole family is now extinct, were, Argent, a chevron be tween three escallops Sable. The present possessor of this barton is Richard Treva nion, Esq. that married Bond, of Earth ; who had issue by her one only daughter, married to Peter Major, of Foye, merchant, now in possession thereof, whose names are the same as the Trevanions of Caryhayes. Trewoola, Tre-wolla, or Tre-wole, gave name and origin to an old family of gentlemen surnamed de Trewolla; who, in allusion to their names, gave for their arms, Sable, three owls. This estate, in the latter end of the reign of"], [581, "GORAN. 111 Charles II. was sold to Charles Trevanion, of Cary- Hayes, Esq. for 900/. by John Trewolla, gentleman, attorney-at law, which was the last parcel of land Trewolla had to sell of a considerable estate elsewhere, formerly sold by his ancestors; and this place was so depressed with mortgages, statutes, and judgments, that the whole consideration money fell much short of paying his creditors, and the incumbrances that were upon it ; so that, in order to make a clear title to the purchaser, several of Trewolla's creditors came to a loss, and in particular, James Hals, of Merthyr, Gent, and Martha his wife, who had a statute staple for 700/. on those lands, who, to comply with Trewolla's bad circum stances, on Mr. Trevanion's paying them 250/. he ami his wife levied a fine thereon, and executed a deed, then de claring the uses thereof to be for the only use of the said Charles Trevanion, Esq. his heirs and assigns for ever. In this parish, at , was the dwelling of my very kind friend Dr. James Gibbs, third son of James Gibbs, Vicar of this parish, who had his education in Exeter Col lege, as a servitor to his kinsman Mr. Davis, son to Dr. Davis late of Plymouth ; where, after he had taken his Bachelor's degree, he declared for the study of physic in Oxford; and soon after, to better his study and experience, went with the said Mr. Davis into France, and fixed at Montpelier, where he practised physic (and also surgery in an hospital, as himself informed me) for several years ; afterwards in the College of Physicians there took his de gree of Doctor of that science ; and, lastly, returned to this place, where he practised physic with admirable care, skill, and success, and through multitudes of patients and moderate fees, hath purchased a considerable estate. Since the writing hereof this gentleman, to the great grief and loss of his country, departed this life of the hemorrhoides sickness; and before his death (who for many years had been his patient, to the great benefit of my health, by God's blessing, after the endeavours of all other physicians proved ineffectual,) left me this legacy, \u2014 that if I myself or friends"], [582, "112 GORAN were sick, and had occasion to make use of physic, that we should in all distempers make use only of the common, plain, and natural remedies. Anthony Wills, of this parish, Gent, farmer of the sheaf thereof, having by misfortune much incumbered his estate with debts, quitted the same at such time as the Prince of Orange landed with his forces at Torbay, and presented himself and his six or seven sons to that Prince, for soldiers of war in his army ; which proposal was gra- ciously accepted ; and they were all posted as officers of command in his bands, or troops. And after the Coro- nation of this Prince, King William III. they followed him in all his Flanders and Irish wars against King James II. and King Lewis XIV. and discharged their trusts with such great care, faithfulness, valour, and conduct, that (as I am informed,) before their deaths they all arrived to the dignities of Captains, and some of them to the authority or commands of Majors, Colonels, and one of them to become a standing Major-General of the field. Who afterwards, about the year A.D. 1714, being made principal com- mander of the army and troops of horse of King George the First, against the Pretender's (James Henry Edward Stewart,) army at Preston, in Lancashire, where, after a furious, violent, and bloody battle with them, he obtained the victory over that pretended Prince's forces ; for which fact, and other noble deeds, he was created a Baronet of England, and is since made General of all the land forces in England next the King, his salary amounting to 7000/. per annum, as reported. TONKIN. For the name, I take it to be a contraction of St. Gor dian, pronounced in Cornwall St. Gorian, who having been, like St. Paul, a violent prosecutor of the Christians, became a proportionably zealous convert, and was beheaded at Rome in the year 341."], [583, "GORAN 113 A tradition in the parish, nevertheless, assigns the guardianship of this church to St. Gorien, or Coren, one of the missionaries from Ireland who accompanied St. Perran. The name of Trevennen, or Tremenen, probably the town of birth, in reference to its fertility, belonged to the Priory of Tywardrith, and formed a part of the lands given by Henry VIII. to the Duchy in exchange for the manor of Wallingford. Adjoining to Trevennen, and within the manor, is Tre vasens, which was long the seat of a family of the same name, but passed to the Hoblyns of Nanswydan, in St. Columb, through an heiress. Polgorror was heretofore a country residence of the Provost of Glasnith College, at Penryn, to which the great tithes were impropriated. This place, with the great tithes and the advowson of the vicarage, now belong to the bishopric of Exeter. Adjoining to this is Treveor, the great town, or dwelling, formerly the seat of Treveors; and the parishioners still talk of Sir Henry Treveor, who lived here ; and a part of his house is yet standing. Pennore, or Penarth. I take nore to signify the same as in Saxon, a promontory ; and that it is here applied to a point jutting out into the sea, namely, to the Dead-man, which is separated from the village by a double intrench- ment, yet pretty entire, running from cliff to cliff, and cutting off about an hundred acres of coarse ground. The intrenchment is about twenty feet broad and twenty-four feet high in most places; but the outer wall is the least high. The people call it Thica Vosa, which is the Vallum, and the Hack and Cast, fabling it to be the work of a giant, who performed the whole in one night. Theyshow also a hole in the cliff which opens into a hollow below, formed by the sea ; and the people relate that this giant growing unwell, applied to a physician, who, that he might rid the world of such a monster, bled him near this spot, and recommended VOL. II. I"], [584, "114 GORAN him to let the blood flow into this hole till it became full. The giant did so, and bled himself to death, when his body fell over on a rock, still called the giant's house. The hole thus attempted to be filled with blood is deno minated from the immense quantity of ivy growing round it. The church is placed very conveniently in the middle of the parish. It is well built, with a handsome square tower of hewn moor stone, with four tunable bells ; and by reason of its high situation this church is seen from a great distance. It consists of a large lofty nave, one south aile of the same length, and two cross ailes to the north, of which one is but small. In the chancel, near the north wall, before the communion table, is a plain marble stone, on which are seen the hollows where the figure of a woman kneeling, with arms, inscription, &c. must have been in laid. Tradition calls it the tomb of Lady Brannell, but who this Lady Brannell was is unknown, although some conjectures are formed of her belonging to the family of Tregarthen. Against the eastern wall, by the window, is a comely monument of black marble, to Richard Edgecombe, of Bodrigan, Esq. son of Sir Richard Edgecombe, of Mount Edgecombe, Knight, who died Nov. 5, 1755. THE EDITOR. The manor of Trevascus belongs by purchase to Mr. Slade Gulby, who resides on the barton of Trevenion, which has been in his family since the time of the Tudors. Treveor belonged to the late Rev. Dr. Wynne, and was given by him to Mr. Pendarves. On this barton may be seen one of those round entrenchments usually denomi nated castles in the West of England. It is at least doubt ful in most cases whether any permanent dwelling was ever connected with them. The barton of Bodrigan has descended in the family of Edgecombe since the time of Henry VI I."], [585, "GORAN 115 It is generally apprehended that Sir Henry Bodrigan was present at the battle of Bosworth Field ; and that, having escaped from thence to Cornwall, he endeavoured to defend his property in a private house against Edge combe and Trevenion, who, in despoiling and endeavouring to take his life, did no more than he would have done, had the fortune of arms inclined the other way ; or than what he actually did against Sir Richard Edgecombe a few years be fore at Cotehele.

The etymologies offered by Mr. Hals appear so very improbable that they are omitted.

The portion of this parish around the church, and the various insulated portions, are situated on magnesian rocks ; the most abundant variety of which is serpentine. This rock is generally of a red colour, but this is evidently in some cases derived from a partial chemical change. In its perfect state this serpentine is generally of a dark-green, with shining scales of diallage, which are commonly of a bronze colour, and at other times of a fine green. The serpentine at Cadgwith may be seen to pass gradually into a schistose rock of a dark bottle-green, and very glassy and spangled on the surface of its lamellae. This slate is ge nerally called greenstone, but it differs therefrom, and consequently requires a distinct appellation. At Cagar there is a quarry in the serpentine ; and at Kennick Cove adjoining, many varieties of these rocks may be obtained."], [588, "118 GULVAL. HALS.

By virtue whereof the Prior of St. German's and his successors were possessed of this manor from that time till the 26th Henry VIIL 1536, when that Priory was dis- solved, and the lands thereof vested in the crown. At which time King Henry VIII. gave the lands thereof to Champernown, Beaumont, Barry, and others ; and to Beaumont's and Barry's share fell this manor of Laneseley ; who parted with it either by purchase or in marriage with his daughter, to John Tripcony, about the year 1565 ; whose son, John Tripcony, having by riot and excess com- paratively wasted his paternal estate, mortgaged this manor of Laneseley to Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollan, knight, about the year 1620, who was lineally descended from Simon de Als, aforesaid, and died seised thereof about the year 1637. After his decease his unthrifty son and heir, John Hals, became possessed thereof, who assigned the mortgage thereof for 500/. to one Mr. Downes, A.D."], [590, "120 GULVAL. 1655; and soon after, having spent his whole paternal estate elsewhere, went beyond the seas, and was never since heard of to this day ; leaving issue, by Jane Arundel his wife, Major Thomas Hals, of Hals's Savana, in Claren don parish and province, in Jamaica, who had issue Thomas Hals, Esq. his son and heir. After the departure of the said John Hals beyond the seas, the said Mr. Downes assigned over the mortgage of the premises to one Mr. Coll well, a scrivener of London; who dying soon after, his son, Thomas Collwell, became seised thereof; and after his death his widow, who by her last will and testament (as executrix of her said husband,) conveyed the said manor to Charles Bonython, Esq. \u2014 Spur, Longeville, and others, in trust, now in possession thereof, 1700; before which time, between the said Downes and Collwell, on pretence of the equity of redemption reserved in Downes, John Hals being beyond the seas, and that the mortgage money to Collwell was satisfied out of the profits of these lands; and a cross bill of Collwell's against Downes, alleging the contrary, and to foreclose him ; hap pened so many tedious and costly Chancery suits as com paratively undid them both. But, maugre all their en deavours, the old titles of Tripcony and Hals were fore closed by a decree in Chancery, betwixt Downes and Coll well, in Hillary term 1689, yet extant and to be seen. This manor of Laneseley, for goodness of land, juris diction, court leet, fishing craft, and royalties over all that part ofthe sea of the Mount's Bay, between Longbridge and Chiandower, near Penzance, may equal, if not surpass, any other manor in those parts of its value, which is now scarcely worth 300/. per annum, though in former ages it was of far larger extent; for in the survey of Cornish acres, tempore Edward II. (Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 46, p. 131, of Lord Dunstanville's edition), it was numbered in the Ex chequer to contain twenty-eight acres, that is, about six thousand statute acres; * every ancient Cornish acre being * Surely sixteen or seventeen hundred. Ed."], [591, "121 GULVAL. sixty statute acres of land ; the contents of the whole now not exceeding a thousand statute acres, which lies in Gul val and Ludgvan. In Fosses Moor, part of this manor of Lanesely, in this parish, is that well-known fountain called Gulval Well. To which place great numbers of people, time out of mind, have resorted for pleasure and profit of their health, as the credulous country people do in these days, not only to drink the waters thereof, but to inquire after the life or death of their absent friends ; where, being arrived, they demanded the question at the well, whether such a person, by name, be Jiving, in health, sick, or dead ; if the party be living, and in health, the still quiet water of the well pit, as soon as the question is demanded, will instantly bubble or boil up as a pot, clear christaline water ; if sick, foul and puddle waters ; if the party be dead, it will neither bubble, boil up, or alter its colour or still motion. How ever, I can speak nothing of the truth of those supernatural facts from my own sight or experience, but write from the mouths of those who told me they had seen and proved the veracity thereof. Finally, it is a strong and courageous fountain of water, kept neat and clean by an old woman of the vicinity, to accommodate strangers for her own advant age, by blazing the virtues and divine qualities of those waters. TONKIN. After copying from Hals, Mr. Tonkin adds of Lanistley manor: \u2014 It extendeth throughout the parish of Gulval from the Moreps to the Gundrons; that is to say, from above the sea to the Down Hills ; it extendeth also through a part of the parish of Ludgvan. At Kenneggy is the dwelling, by lease (the fee being in his elder brother, William Harris, of Hayne, Esq.), of Christopher Harris, Gentleman, an attorney-at-law, who married a daughter of John Foote, of Truro, Esq. His"], [592, "122 GULVAL. elder brother, who married the daughter of John St. Aubyn, Esq. of Clowance, in the parish of Crowan, is now in possession of Hayne, near Lifton, in Devonshire, having succeeded to it on the decease of Sir Arthur Harris, jun. the last heir male of the elder branch. On removing to Hayne he leased Kenneggy to his younger brother aforesaid ; who, by reason of the elder brother's yet want of issue, is likely to become his heir. The arms of Harris are, Sable, within a bordure three crescents Argent. Mr. Edward Llwyd, in his letter to me, would have this parish to take its name from the inscription on the stone in Maddern parish, \" Riolabran : Cunoval : Fil : \" and that Cunoval is turned by corruption into Guloval, for that he found many such instances in Wales. I should be glad to agree with so great a critic, but since there is a saint, or bishop, whose name comes very near to this \u2014 St. Gunwall, whose memory the church celebrates on the 6th of June, I cannot forbear fancying, especially the humour of the country being considered, that he is the patron and the namer of this parish. THE EDITOR. There cannot be any reasonable doubt of St. Gunwall having bestowed his name on this parish, more especially when the prophetic well is taken into account, since saints scarcely ever failed of imparting some supernatural quality to their favourite streams. St. Gunwall was, moreover, a Briton, and is stated to have been in Cornwall. Saint Gudwall, or Gunwall, was born in Wales about the year 500. Being entirely devoted to God, he collected eighty-eight monks in a little island called Plecit, being no more than a rock surrounded by water. For some reason, however, he abandoned this establishment, and passed by sea into Cornwall ; and from thence he went into De-"], [593, "123 GULVAL. vonshire, where he betook himself to the most holy, perfect, and useful state of a solitary anchorite ; at length, however, again emerging, he sailed into Britany, and there succeeded St. Malo, as Bishop of that see, although he is said even then to have dwelt in a solitary cell, and to have died there at a very advanced age. His relics have been widely dis tributed, and various places in France have been called by his name. Mr. Whitaker explains the ancient name of this parish, Lanisley, by Lan and Ishei, low, or lower, the low church, which appears to agree very well with the situation. The great tithes certainly belonged to the Priory at St. German's, for in the returns made to Henry VIII. of the property belonging to them, appears \u2014 Gulval, decim\u00e6 Garbarum, 6s. 8d. These tithes, since the law-suits mentioned by Mr. Hals, have passed by purchase into the possession of the Beau champs of Gwenap, and now belong to the two daughters and coheiresses of the late Mr. John Beauchamp. The vicarage, although it has risen into one of the most valuable to be found in that district, in consequence of modern improvements, and of its being situated near Pen zance, is yet rated under twenty pounds a-year in the King's Books, and therefore passes by the presentation of the Lord Chancellor. Two Mr. Pennerks, father and son, held this living in succession. It was then given, in 1789, to Mr. John Cole, afterwards Doctor in divinity and Rec tor of Exeter College, and his successor is the present Vicar, the Rev. Robert Dillon. Kenegie passed from Mr. William Harris, of Hayne, accordingly as Mr. Tonkin had conjectured, to the family of his brother, Mr. Christopher Harris; and the family becoming extinct in the male line by the death of this gentleman's grandson in 1775, by much the largest part of the estate went, under the provisions of a will, to Mr. William Arundell, then resident at Crane, in Camborne, who assumed the name of Harris; but his grandson"], [594, "124 GULVAL. choosing to fix his permanent residence at a very hand some seat of his own creating near Lifton, parted with all his Cornish property ; and Kenegie now belongs, in fee, to the farmer, who had occupied it at an annual rent. This place having formerly belonged to the family of Tripcony, who bore for their arms, Argent, three rabbits passant Sable, and kynin and kyninger being the Cornish names for a rabbit, I cannot but suspect that kynneggy, or kenegie, must have some relation to the name of Tri- peney. Trevailer is the place next of importance in this parish. It has been long the residence of a very respectable family, the Veales. They are said to have come from Gloucestershire, their ancestor having been the first Protestant Vicar of Gulval. The Reverend William Veale, the present possessor, has rebuilt the house ; the second brother of his grandfather, Mr. George Veale, made a large fortune at Penzance, by the practice of the law and by success in mines, which became divided between three daughters who married Hichens, Baines, and Jenkins. Mr. William Veale has married the only daughter of the Rev. Richard Gerveys Grylls, of Helston. But the most beautiful place in this parish, and one of the greatest ornaments to the whole neighbourhood, is Rosemorron, the Vale of Blackberries, formed by Mr. George John. This gentleman having married Jane, the eldest daughter of Mr. Arundall, who assumed the name of Harris on succeeding to the large fortune of that family, and having been for many years at the head of his profes sion in Penzance, has at length retired to this delightful spot in the summer months. Nor have his decorations of the country been confined to one situation ; he has shewn, by extensive plantations at Try, that the most elevated and barren tracts, even on a granite soil, may be rendered use ful and decorative by the growth of trees. The lower part of the parish, adjoining to the sea, is fertile in the highest degree, from the village of Chian-"], [595, "GULVAL. 125 dower (the house by the water), through Pendrea to the Church Town. And the vallies, abounding in trees, rival those of any country. Chiandower is also become a place worthy of the adjacent scenery, through the taste and the exertions of Messrs. Bolitho, who, in making ample fortunes, have benefited the country still more than themselves by promoting every species of productive industry. The parish feast does not certainly corroborate the supposition of the patron saint ; it is held on the nearest Sunday to the 12th of November, the day of St. Martin, the first Pope of that name, a native of Todi, in Tuscany, and elected Pope in the year 649. He assembled in the same year the sixth council of Lateran, where the heresy of the Monothelites was condemned ; but the schismatic Emperor, Constans, sent Olympius, his chamberlain, to Rome, to support the obnoxious sect, who arrived there while the council were deliberating ; and failing in his attempts to divert them from supporting the orthodox faith, he suborned a person to murder the Pope, but in attempting to execute the atro cious deed the assassin was miraculously struck blind. Yet, nevertheless, Constans persevered in his speculative errors and in his wicked conduct, by causing St. Martin to be seized, and after suffering many casualties, to be banished to the Tauric Chersonesus, where he died in 655. His relics were afterwards brought to Rome, and depo sited in the church of St. Martin of Tours, on the 12th of November, which, from thenceforward, was observed as a festival to his honour. The day of St. Martin of Tours, the popular patron of beggars, happens to be on the day before, and several parishes give their feasts on the nearest Sunday to Novem ber the 11th, but Gulval alone honours the Pope and Saint.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The northern part of this parish rests on granite, which is for the most part a coarse crystalline rock, containing very large porphyritic crystals of felspar. The granite is, however, in some places very fine-grained, and near its juncture with the slate abounds in shorl. The schistose rocks composing the southern part of the parish, have a basis of compact felspar, assuming various appearances ac cording as it is more or less siliceous ; those rocks are often beautifully marked with crystalline patches and veins of actynolite, as may be seen in the rocks on the sea shore, and they are traversed here and there by beds of felspar porphyry, into which they gradually pass.

TONKIN. In this parish stands a circle of rude unwrought stones in the shape of a wall heaped together, and called Earth. THE EDITOR. Mr. Whitaker remarks in a note on Hal's MS. that the name of this parish is clearly derived from its patron saint, Winn wallo. I find that Winwallo was the son of a petty Prince in Wales ; who, flying with his family from the Saxons, went into Britany, where he acquired the habit of undergoing monastic austerities under the guidance of St. Budock. He ultimately founded a monastery called Landevenech, about three miles from Brest. He became the first Abbat, and died on the 3d of March about the year 529. His body was buried at Landevenech ; but in after ages, when the northmen extended their ravages to this part of the Conti nent, his relics were removed to places of greater safety ; and as an effectual security against an entire loss, portions were preserved at St. Peter's, at Blandinberg, at Ghent, at Montreuil, and at other places. The Celtic name has given origin to various pronuncia tions, and to as many corresponding orthographies ; the G and W at the beginning of words are well known to take"], [598, "128 GUNWALLO. each the place of the other almost without discrimination. In Picardy, where he is esteemed the patron, Winwallo is changed into Vignevaley and Walovay; in Britany into Guignole and Vennole; in other parts of France into Guingalois. It is the more probable that St. Winwallo may be the patron saint of this parish, and that he may have given it his name, since a parish in the neighbourhood stands in that relation towards his teacher St. Budock. The parish feast, however, is held on the last Sunday in April, although St. Winwallo is honoured in the Roman calendar on the third of March. Mr. Lysons says that the manor of Wynyaton, or Wining ton, called by Mr. Hals Gonwallowinton, was given about the year 1235, by Roger Earl of Cornwall, in exchange for Bossineyr, to Gervase de Harnington ; from whom it passed by an heiress to the family of Trevanthians, and again in the same way to Roskymers. It ultimately belonged to the Arundells till the general sale of all Lord Arundell's pro perty in Cornwall, when this manor was purchased by Mr. John Rogers, of Penrose, near Helston. The church is situated among sandbanks, and very near the sea. In those banks Captain Avery, the celebrated buccaneer, is reported to have buried several chests of treasure previously to his leaving England on the voyage from which he never returned. So strongly has this opinion prevailed, that Mr. John Knill, collector of the customs at St. Ives, procured, about the year 1770, a grant of treasure trove, and expended some money in a fruitless search. This gentleman is still remembered on account of his singularities, and his having erected a pyramid on a hill near the town where he had long resided.

The shore, where the land lies low, is covered with banks of siliceous sand, which near the church form an extensive down. At the Cove the rocks consist of a blue glassy slate, and of a compost rock ofthe same colour which decomposes into a white clay. Nearly the whole of the cliff is a diluvial mass ; the lower part of which, just above high-water mark, is consolidated into a conglomerate sandstone, apparently through the cementing medium of a solution of carbonate of iron, derived from the percolation of rain-water through the bed of ferru ginous clay that forms the upper part of this deposit- GWENAP.

The first progenitor of the tribe and name of Beauchamp came into England a soldier under William the Conqueror, and probably some of his posterity were planted in this province, from whence those gentlemen are descended ; especially if the name, Stephen de Bellocampo, 40th Henry III. who held in Cornwall by tenure of knight's service 15/. per annum land and rents, may be interpreted the same as Beauchamp (Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 40), for otherwise verily I know not from what family of gentlemen those Beau champs are descended ; since none other of that name give the same arms as these do ; for Guy de Beauchamp, Sheriff of Devon, 12th King John, gave for his arms, Gules, a fess between three crosses bottony Or ; from whom are de scended the Beauchamps of Bletsho and Hatch, in Wilt- shire.

Query, whether the arms of those gentlemen living in this place be not the"], [601, "131 GWENAP. arms of Bochym, as I have been informed they are, which is Vaire Argent and Azure. Notwithstanding this place of Trefyns was heretofore denominated from springs of water abounding there in winter season, yet I assure you now in summer time, by reason of the tin-mines and subterranean adits near it that carry those springs of water invisibly under ground, water is very scarce and much wanting in those lands. It is also called Trevense, and Trewince. St. Dye chapel in this parish was heretofore a chapel of ease to Gwenap ; the tutelar guardian whereof is St. Dye, of Gaul, very famous in that country for his piety and holy Christian living about the fifth century, who held the faith in opposition to Arianism and Pelagianism, then raging in the church. And there is a church in the pro vince of Lorraine still bearing his name. If it were as easy for the Vicar to attend and perform divine service in this remote quarter of the parish where this chapel is, as it is convenient to his parishioners in the town of St. Dye, it had been doubtless still applied to the end and use for which it was erected. Not far from this place is that unparalleled and inex haustible tin-work called Paldys ; i. e. the top or head of St. Dye's Town, which for above forty years' space hath employed yearly from eight hundred to a thousand men and boys, labouring for and searching after tin in that place, where they have produced and raised up for that time yearly, at least twenty thousand pounds worth of that commodity, to the great enriching of the lords of the soil, the bound owners, and adventurers in those lands. Of those miners, or searchers for metals, hath Ovid written elegantly in Latin verse, which sounds thus in English, tempore Augusti : \u2014 Men deep descend into the earth With mattock, shoul, and spade, And wicked wealth is digged up, Which mischiefs all hath made ; K 2"], [602, "132 GWENAP.

TONKINS. In this parish, on the top of a lofty mountain called Carne-mark, are two or three stone tumuli, under which are doubtless interred the bodies of some distinguished persons. The right name of this parish is St. Wenep, a female saint, to whom the parish is dedicated. THE EDITOR. Saint Wenep is, I believe, only remembered by the dedication of this parish; but St. Dye is a personage o'"], [603, "GWENAP. 133 more consequence. He was a native of France, and in the year 655 became Bishop of Nevres ; but St. Dye hap pened to live at a period when the prevalent fanaticism induced persons to believe that the Author of all good was most gratified by beholding the misery of his rational creatures, accompanied by their voluntary debasements through ignorance and solitude below the level ofthe brute creation. With this persuasion, St. Dye resigned his bishopric, and founded a house for monks at a place called Jointures, but retired himself to an anchorite cell. He is said to have died on the 19th of June, 680. The chapel, dedicated to St. Dye, in Gwenap, had long been in ruins ; but since the eager contest has grown up between the Establishment and Dissenters for retaining or acquiring power through the media of extensive education and proselytism, and Chapels, Meeting Houses, and Schools have arisen all over England, St. Dye has seen a new and spacious building displace the ruins that remained from former times. The Beauchamps had removed from Trewince to Pen greap; where the family became extinct in the male line about the year 1818, by the decease of Mr. Joseph Beauchamp, who had lost his only son a few years before, and the estate is now divided between the two daughters of his elder brother, Mr. John Beauchamp. Cornmarth has been already mentioned. Mr. WThitaker says that the true name is Cornmarke, and that it means the Knight's barrow. On the southern declivity of Cornmarth is a large exca vation, supposed by some to have been made long ago for the exhibition of games, but by others to owe its general form to the accidental running together of an old mine. It is, at all events, admirably adapted to the purpose of enabling a speaker to address an extremely large assembly; and the late Mr. John Wesley has been distinctly heard by many thousands at a time in Gwenap pit."], [604, "134 GWENAP. Sconaier, which a few years since exhibited the appear ance of a small village, has now become perhaps the chief place in this parish. Mr. John Williams, one ofthe most extensive and most successful managers and adventurous miners of the present time, built here an excellent house, and adorned it with the finest collection of Cornish minerals ever brought together. Mr. Williams, after making a large fortune, has retired at an advanced age, leaving several sons engaged in the same pursuits with equal ad vantage to themselves and to the public ; one of whom has added a second splendid house to the village. It is quite impossible for me to enter fully into a description of the mines, which have continued in work on the most extensive scale from the period when Mr. Leman commenced the modern system up to the present time. It is said that no district of the same extent in any part of the world ever produced so much riches. Poldice was worked for tin about the commencement of the last century by Mr. Hearle, of Penryn. The mine happened to have very little water, and this was exhausted by rflck and chain pumps moved by human labour. Copper seldom appears near the surface, as is the case with tin ; but tin lodes out of granite frequently produce copper in depth. All the lodes in Gwenap have done so, and in some places the mines have gone to the depth of two hundred and thirty or forty fathoms from the sur face, more than two hundred fathoms under the level of the sea, assisted by steam engines having working-cylinders ninety inches in diameter and ten feet long. The freehold of the land containing those mines is pos sessed in undivided shares between several persons ; Mr. Hearle had one-third, that is now divided again into thirds between the descendants of three daughters, Mr. Tremayne, Mr. Rodd, and Mr. Stephens. The church in Gwenap is large in every dimension, but, what is very unusual, the tower stands apart. One of our"], [605, "135 GWENAP. late historians very justly complains of what he terms the \" mangling of modern Vandalism,\" in alterations of the church; Venetian frames have been substituted for stone mullions ; windows of painted glass bearing the figures of saints have been removed; and the screen, or rood-loft, of beautiful workmanship has disappeared; modern deal seats have been introduced throughout the church, and a glare of light on the white-washed walls has completed the overthrow of very thing venerable. The interior is divided into a nave, a chancel, and two side ailes, supported on each side by seven handsome columns. The burial-ground contains a monument of fine marble in memory of the Beauchamps. There is a tradition in the parish of monks having been established in the church tower, and that a house now con- verted to an inn, was a part of the building. No notice whatever is taken of such a monastery in any authentic work. If therefore this tradition rests on any fact, the house cannot have been more than an hostelry for friars.

It appears that the vicarage of Wendron, and perhaps the endowed portion of the great tithes, belonged to Rew ley Abbey, near Oxford, founded by Edmund Earl of Cornwall, in compliance with an injunction of his father Richard Earl of Cornwall ; although Richard himself seems to have commenced the foundation, for a manuscript history in the Cotton Library says, \" Frater enim hujus regis (Henrici tertii) Ricardus pri mus Comes Cornubi\u00e6, post Rex Alemani\u00e6 et Semper Au gustus, fundavit Abbatias monachorum Cisterciensis ordinis de Royal alias Rewley Oxoni\u00e6, et de Hayles in Comitatu Gloucestri\u00e6, ubi honorifice est sepultus.

This advowson had passed through various hands till it was assigned by Mr. Matthew Wills, of Helston, on whose decease, in 1782, it came to his son, Mr. Thomas Wills. This gentleman, although not intended for the church, had received his education at Winchester and Oxford, and the living happening to become vacant just at the period of his father's death, Mr. Wills was induced to take holy orders, and he is now (1834) the Incumbent; but the advowson has been transferred to Queen's College, Oxford, for its Michell or new foundation ; thus returning almost to the very spot where it was bestowed almost six hundred years before. The barton of Trenethick is traced back to the family of Seneschalls, from whom it came by a marriage to the Hills ; the last of whom, Mr. John Hill, gave it by will, about seventy years since, to a family long seated in Con stantine, of the same name, but, from their bearing different arms, probably not related. Nansloe, the vale leading to the lake, is beautifully situated in a valley near the Loo. It has been for some time the seat of the Robinsons, since they removed there from Bochim in Cury. The last representative of this family in the male line was the late Reverend William Robinson, Vicar of Crowan. Trelil belonged to Mr. Rowe, steward to Lord Godolphin. his only daughter and eventual heiress married Mr. William Harris, of Rosewarne, in Camburne, Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1773 ; and their only daughter, married to Winchcornbe Hartley, Esq. of Berkshire, is its present possessor. This parish has for ages been one of the most productive"], [610, "140 GWENDRON. of tin in the whole county; and before the improved operations of smelting had placed all ores nearly on the same level as to the quality of their products, the neigh bourhood of Porkellis boasted of producing the best tin in Cornwall. The church is situated nearly at one extremity of this immense parish, and has nothing to distinguish it but a monument to the memory of Warin Penhallinyk, a pre bendary of the monastery at Penryn, Rector of St. Just, in Roseland, Vicar of Wendron and of the adjoining parish, Stithyans. The Vicarage-house is a mere hovel. she parish feast is on the nearest Sunday to October the 28th, St. Simon and St. Jude. Mr. Jago, Vicar of Wendron, was perhaps the last clergyman in the west of Cornwall supposed to exercise supernatural powers ; various anecdotes were current about him sixty years ago, and then generally believed ; all I apprehend to his credit, being such as laying spirits, dis- covering thieves, &c. mixed up, however, with frivolities, as seems ever to have happened in those popular legends. Whenever parson Jago got off from his horse he struck the ground with his whip, and a demon immediately ap- peared to hold or take care of his horse till he wanted it again. The Rev. Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell is descended either from this gentleman or from his father. This parish measures (including Helston) 12,317 statute acres.

About two-thirds of this extensive parish is situated on granite, which is the same as that of Camborne, Crowan, and Sithney adjoining; the other third, which forms the southern part of the parish, is composed of slate rocks, which near the granite are felspathic, and clearly referrible to the porphyritic series ; but as the sea is approached, the character of these slates becomes obscure, such as they generally are whenever the porphyritic and calcareous series pass into each other.

The parish of Gwiner has been extremely productive in copper. Herland Mine, usually called the manor, pro duced so large a return to Mr. Hobbin, only part proprie tor of the land, as paid for the building of Nansewidden in St. Columb, about the middle of the last century. It has been since wrought on a most extensive scale, and to a great depth. Whele Alfred, Whele Trelistion, and others, have been very productive ; but at present they are all discontinued. The family of most consequence connected with this parish is that of Lanyon. The first syllable certainly implies an inclosed place, from which it has become specifically applied to a church, to a castle, and even to a town. Mr. Hals' conjectures as to the termination of the name, appear to be so utterly groundless that they are omitted. Mr. Whitaker believes that Lanyon in Normandy bears only a castle for its cognisance, and that the falcon has been added on account of the similarity in sound of Lanyer to Lanner, the favourite bird in falconry. It must be observed however that Lanyon is always in Cornwall pronounced La-nine. The Gwinear and Madern branches of the Laryon family were together possessed of extensive property in the adja cent parishes ; combinations of unfortunate circumstances have diminished their possessions, but hopes may be en tertained that the Lanyons of Gwinear, who have never"], [614, "144 GWINEAR. lost the sense of what is due to the memory of their an cestors, may again resume the former station of their family.

This parish, like those adjoining, Camborne and Crowan, has been long celebrated for its mines, but it does not re semble them by reposing in part on granite, being confined entirely to rocks of the slate series. The porphyritic courses are not so common here as in Gwennap ; but they often assume a very interesting form, occurring as insulated masses, which in some cases are per- fectly granitic, and at the same time afford every indication of their having been formed contemporaneously with the slate. The most curious geological phenomenon of this parish is to be met with in Relistion Mine, where one of the lodes, (metalliferous veins) at a considerable depth, is composed of rounded pedules, cemented together in a hard solid mass ; at first sight it would be pronounced to be a decided conglomerate of derivative origin ; but on a more close examination it is found to have the spheroidal struc ture, which is common to many rocks, and which in regard to this mineral was probably coeval with its original forma tion."], [615, "145 GWITHIAN. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath upon the north the Irish Sea, or St. George's Channel, and that creek or cove called Gwithian Bay, east Uligan, west Phelack, south Gwyniar. The entry occurs, Rex tenet Canardi-tone, in the Domes day tax 20 William I. 1087. For in this parish is the voke lands of the great and privileged manor of Coner, or Conner-ton, which claims by prescription not only the royalties and jurisdiction within its limits, but also over the whole hundred of Penwith (id est, the head tree). Hence it is that this manor of Connerton is privileged not only with the jurisdic tion of a Court Leet or Baron for the whole hundred of Penwith, within which two courts are tried all matters of debt and damage between party and party within the same, (life, land, and limb excepted,) wherein heretofore infinite number of causes have been depending, by reason of its being the most remote part of the kingdom from the Courts of Westminster; the steward or judge of which courts, (which offices commonly are vested in one person,) takes his deputation from the now lord of the manor, viz. Sir John Arundell, of Lanherne, Knight, and not from the King or Duke of Cornwall's stewards, as other bailiwicks do. For in the time of King Henry III. this manor was the King of England's or Earl of Cornwall's lands, who, by letters patent, yet to be seen at Lanherne, passed it over, together with the bailiwick of the said hundred, to Simon Pincerna, or Butler, lord of Lanherne, in consideration that he the said Simon had enfeoffed the said King Henry, vol. n. l"], [616, "146 GWITHIAN. his heirs and successors, with the lordship and manor of St. James at Westminster, in the county of Middlesex. After which exchange or settlement, Pincerna and his heirs enjoyed this manor for several descents, till Edward Ill's days. At which time one ofthe two daughters and heirs of Pincerna was married to Arundell of Trenibleth, the direct ancestor of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, Knight, now in possession of both those lordships. The other daughter to Umphravill. To remove an action at law depending in those Courts, the writ must be thus directed : \" Senescallo et Ballivo hundredi et libertatis su\u00e6 de Penwith in Comitatu Cornu bi\u00e6 salutem.\" In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Win chester into the value of Cornish benefices, 1294, \" Eccle sia de Sancto Gwyth-ran, in decanatu de Penwidh,\" is valued cxiiis. iiiie?. It seems at the time of this inquisition this church was not consolidated into Phillack ; but before Wolsey's Inquisition, 1521, it past in consolidation and value together with it, at 45/. 10s. 8d. The patronage was formerly in the King of England, who endowed it ; now Arundell of Lanherne. And the parish is rated to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1 696, 58/. 2s. by the name Gwith-ran. TONKIN. This church is a rectory, daughter to Phillack, together with which it is rated in the King's Books, and passeth in the presentation. The patronage is in Arundell of Lan herne, the incumbent Mr. Jasper Phillips. This gentle man is since deceased, and has left the next presentation, held by lease under the Arundells, to his nephew Mr. Gregory, who has presented his brother-in-law, Mr. Ed ward Collins, son of Mr. Collins, of Treworgy in St. Erm (great-grandfather to the Editor). This parish takes its name, like many others, from the"], [617, "GWITIIIAN. 147 Saint to whom the church is dedicated, called by Mr. Carew, St. Gothian. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals's derivation is again so utterly improbable as to be omitted. The Arundells, being Catholics, leased the advowson of Phillack and Gwithian on lives, to prevent its lapsing to the University of Oxford, under an Act of Parliament. On the death of Mr. Edward Collins it did so lapse, and the University presented Mr. William Glover, of Worces- tershire, first of Balliol College and then a chaplain of All Souls. A lease was then granted to Mr. Hojikin, of Gwi- thian, and his son the Rev. Richard Ho^kin succeeded Mr. Glover, who on the general sale of all the Arundell pro perty in Cornwall, purchased the freehold, so that his son is now patron and incumbent of the united parishes. Mr. Lysons says that the advowson of these united pa rishes belonged to the Priory of St. James in Bristol, and I find a charter of King Henrv II. O r \" Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angli\u00e6, et Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6, et Comes Andegavi\u00e6, Archiepiscopis, &c. sa- lutem.

It is understood that the manor of Conorton had in some way been connected with the honour of Gloucester before the Conquest. William certainly gave it with that honour to Alan Earl of Britanny. Rufus had it again to bestow, l 2"], [618, "148 GWITHIAN. and under his grant it descended to the Earls of Gloucester, originating in an illegitimate son of King Henry I. Wil liam, the second of these earls, endowed the Priory of St. James. Mr. Lysons says that Robert Earl of Gloucester, son of this Robert, gave Conorton to Richard Pincerna in 1 154, but he is clearly mistaken, for the date proves it to be done by the same William. Pincerna is a word used by writers medi\u00e6 et infim\u00e6 Latinitatis for butler. Qui vinum con vivis miscet, a Gr\u00e6co -mveiv Kipva. Ducange. Mihi sapit dulcius vinum in taherna, Quam quod aqua miscuit Pr\u00e6sulis Pincerna. Walter de Mapes. The son of this Pincerna took the name of Conorton, as was usual in those Himes, and settled at Lanherne; from this family it passed with Lanherne to the Arundells, by marriage, in whom it continued till the general wreck above referred to, when being reduced to a mere royalty it was bought by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, and since his decease in 1829 the royalty has been purchased by an attorney, for the purpose in all probability of holding the courts. There is a tradition, supported by the authority of Le land, that a town so large as to contain two churches stood on this manor, which has been destroyed by sand ; but the tale must at the least be a very great exaggeration. The account given by Mr. Hals of the exchange of the manor of Conorton for St. James' in Westminster, can scarcely be made to quadrate with the above account, which appears to be authentic, and it is still further op posed by the history of St. James's Hospital, as given by Tanner and Dugdale, they say : \" At a distance from the city, in the fields near West minster, some well disposed citizens of London, beyond the memory of man, and (as some think) long before the Conquest, founded a hospital for the reception of fourteen"], [619, "149 GWITHIAN. leprous women, to whom were afterwards added brethren, to minister divine service. This house was dedicated to St. James, and rebuilt in the time of King Henry III. It was under the government of a master (although the Abbat of Westminster claimed a jurisdiction over it) till King Henry VI. granted the perpetual custody of it to Eton College, who surrendered it to King Henry VIII. anno Regni 23, (A. D. 1531) when it was valued at 100/. per annum, in exchange for Chattisham in Suffolk. On or near the place where this hospital stood has been since built the present Royal Palace of St James. Mr. Lysons has been so fortunate as to obtain from the late rector some information respecting the inundation of sand, which has devastated a large portion of these two parishes, extending its ravages wherever the coast, is low, throughout the whole northern space of Cornwall, from the Land's End to Devonshire. There has always existed a traditional account of this inundation, corroborated by the ecclesiastical valuations, which are far too high for the actual extent of land, and also said to be confirmed by do cuments preserved in the Arundell family, carrying back the commencement of the evil nearly to the period of their acquiring the property. With respect to more recent inundations, Mr. Hqjskin stated to Mr. Lysons, that the barton of Upton, one of the principal farms, was suddenly overwhelmed ; that his great-grandfather remembered the occupier residing in the farmhouse, which was nearly buried in one night, the fa mily being obliged to make their escape through the cham ber windows ; and that in consequence of the wind pro ducing a shifting ofthe sand, in the winter of 1808-9, the house, after having disappeared for more than a century, came again to view. The rector further stated that he himself remembered two fields lost at Gwithian, and that they are now covered with sand to the depth of ten or twelve feet, and that the church-town would have been also lost, if the parish"], [620, "150 G WITH IAN. officers had not promptly resorted to an expedient, which, simple as it may seem, has every where proved to be the most efficacious in arresting this gigantic evil, that of plant ing rushes ; these stop completely the progress of sand, and greatly facilitate the growth of other vegetation on the surface, so as to create a thin turf. The hillocks of sand exhibit a model in miniature of the Alps. This sand is entirely calcareous, being a mass of commi nuted shells, and immense quantities are carried away for. manure, more especially in the cultivation of strong clay lands ; but no method sufficiently cheap for practice has yet been invented for burning this shell sand into lime, as the fine powder chokes the fuel in any kiln, and a reverbe ratory furnace is much too expensive. On the opposite coast of Cornwall the sand is siliceous. Godrery belongs to Lord De Dunstanville, a bold pro montory distinguished by an island beyond it, and by a dangerous reef extending far into St. Ive's Bay. Other lands are much divided. Mr. Hojjkin the present rector, and his relations, are considerable proprietors, and several resident farmers live on their own freeholds, Mr. Veal, Mr. Phillips, and others. Notice has been taken of a very large fig tree growing in the churchyard ; the wonder is much diminished by know ing that this tree was planted by the late rector; but as chalk is of all soils the most favourable to figs, it is not im probable that calcareous sand may participate in the same quality.

BOASE. The rocks of this parish are well exhibited at Godrery Point, they consist of a fine blue and fissile slate, and of a thick lamellar and somewhat compact rock. They are not metalliferous, and resemble those of Trevaunance in St. Agnes. The greater part of the parish is covered with hil locks of calcareous sand, as is common on many parts of the north coast.

Note further, that whosoever is possessed in fee of the bar ton of Helland, (for Bara-ton, i. e. the Bread Town lands in this parish,) is legal patron of the same, paying only 40s. to the Rector Incumbent for the time being, in full satis faction for all the great and small tithes of the said barton, according to an ancient pact or composition made between the first Rector thereof and the Prior of Bodmin, who en dowed it. Which sum of 40s. per annum at the time of the Inquisition aforesaid, was the value of the tithes of the whole parish. Note further, wherever the word barton occurs in this history, it being Cornish British, it must be interpreted either as the barred, bolted, or fenced towne, or as a con traction of the word Bara-ton aforesaid, for as bara is bread in British, so ton or tone is a town or village, a manor, parish, tenement, or part thereof; the place where commonly the lord of the land had a well bolted or barred house to dwell in ; or else a town or house which was notable for keeping or dispensing freely of bread for support of man's life. TONKIN. The words Hel or Hale are at least the Cornish pronun ciation of the English hall, atrium, and this word was ap plied to churches as well as to gentlemen's houses in various parts of England, as Helldon Rectory in Norfolk Hailing, Kent, &c, and see the 140th stanza of Mount Calvary.

In this parish lived the old family of the Giffords, who married one of the inheritrixes of the Esses, or Vanstorts, in the time of Henry VI. as Gifford's heiress was mar ried to Nicholls of Penrose. THE EDITOR. Mr. Whitaker has observed, in a note on what Mr. Hals says on the word barton, a term now almost indiscri minately applied to all large farms, although in former times it was probably restricted to what Mr. Hals denomi nates the yoke land of a manor. Barton in English is Bere-ton, as Berwick, and signifies primarily a farm-house distinguished by the corn generally raised, once bere, or barley ; and from the house the term has been transferred to the estate annexed. Baraton here means the same as bara, bread or corn, bara pill the corn harbour, bara-Llan, barton (Cornish) a cornfield, and barn (as in English) a corn-house. Mr. Lysons mentions several manors in this parish, but they do not appear ever to have possessed any importance or curiosity, except that the manor of Penhargard belonged to the unfortunate Chief Justice Trevilian, and that the barton of Brades or Broads was for some time the seat of a younger branch of the Glynns. Robert Glynn, Esq. residing there, married in 1711 Lucy Clobery, and their only son was Doctor Glynn, a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, well known and dis tinguished for his abilities, learning, and philanthropy, and in some degree also for occasional eccentricities. He obtained not merely one of the University prizes, but great reputation by a Latin Poem on the Day of Judgment, in the year 1757 ; and in illustration of other parts of his character, having attended as a physician on the family of some agricultural labourer near Cambridge, and restored"], [624, "154 HELLAND. them to health, the man's wife lamented their poverty, but begged of the Doctor to take a tame bird in their posses sion, as the only thing in their power to bestow. Doctor Glynn accepted the present, but declared that he could not keep his bird in a college room, and that therefore they must keep it for him, at an allowance of half a crown a week. To be invited by Doctor Glynn to drink tea at his room was always considered as an honour by the younger mem bers of the University, and the Editor remembers to have heard that Mr. Pitt, then at the head of the government, and just elected into a seat more flattering than any office the crown could confer, expressed himself pleased by the repetition of these invitations from Doctor Glynn.

It is however worthy of remark that in the road from Bodmin to Camelford several beds of granitic elvan are exposed to view. The first at the top of the hill near Smith's, resembles a coarse granitic sandstone, and at its junction with the slate both rocks are perfectly distinct, not having any appearance of transition, which circumstance is in favour of its being a derivative rock.

The other elvans are more compact and porphyritic, and contain hornblende, resembling those of Carraton Hill, near Lis keard, situated within the granite."], [625, "155 HELSTON. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the east Gwendron, west Sythney and the Loopoole, south Maugan and Gunwallo. That this was a privileged place, and the voke lands of a manor, with court leet, before the Norman Conquest, I make no doubt, since the whole hundred of Kerryer, in King Alfred's days, was in chief denominated from it. Besides this testimony, in Domesday Roll 20 William I. 1087, we read that by the name of Henliston, it was then taxed. Moreover, Brooke, York Herald, tells us temp. James I. in the Catalogue of Cornish Earls, that the privi leges of this town or manor were concerted into a charter, and incorporated by Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Corn wall, 3d son of King Henry II. surnamed Cur-lyon, from his lion-like heart, in the name of Helleston, as appeared from the charter, which he had then in his custody, to the seal whereof was affixed a lion rampant. It was also made one of the four coinage towns by King Edward I. in his charter to the Tinners, by the same name ( See the charter under Luxilian). As also incorporated into the Duchy of Cornwall, by the same name 1336, when King Edward III. to his son the Black Prince promoted or translated the Earldom of Cornwall into a Duchy or Dukedom. Wherebv this town is also confirmed to be the voke lands of the manors or stanneries of Helston and Kerryer, (id est, Hall, Broad Town, and Lover,) and privileged with a Court Leet, wherein all pleas of debt and damage, be tween party and party, concerning tin matters, are tried by a jury of six men, before the Vice Warden and Steward of the Stanneries, (under the Lord Warden thereof,) life, land, and limb excepted. It is also privileged with a Court"], [626, "156 HELSTON. Leet before the tribunal of the Mayor and Aldermen, and Quarterly Sessions of the Peace, and sending two members to Parliament; markets weekly on Saturday; fairs on Au gust 29, October 28, Saturday before Midlent Sunday, Saturday before Palm Sunday, Whitsun Monday, and two fairs before St. Thomas a Becket's day. Moreover, these privileges were confirmed and enlarged by charters temp. Queen Elizabeth and King Charles I. by the name of the Mayor and Burgesses, who consist of a Mayor (who is a Justice of the Peace for the Borough, the year succeeding his Mayoralty), and four Aldermen, who elect as many Common Councilmen as make their number twelve. Their Members of Parliament are elected by the majority of the freemen, and returned by the Mayor, to whom the precept on the writ for election must be thus directed, as well as that for removing an action depending in the Leet of Hel ston to a superior Court : \" Majori et Burgensibus Burgi nostri de Helleston in Comitatu Cornubi\u00e6, salutem.\" Not far from this town stands the ruins of an old camp, or intrenchment, called Castle Werre, or Wera, an old fort or citadel to defend it from its enemies' invasion. The arms of which town are Argent, a castle, or house, garreted on the top thereof, between two watch-towers, the Archangel St. Michael fighting with a dragon, or the devil. That King Edward I. frequented this place for delight or pleasure, or designed so to do, upon the death of his uncle Richard Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, when the Earldom of Cornwall reverted to himself, in right of his Crown of England, Anno Dom. 1272, is evident from his granting lands by the tenure of grand sergeantry to William de Treville, on condition of bringing a fish hook and a boat and net, at his own proper costs and charges, for the king's fishing in the lake of Helston, when soever the King should come to Helston, and as long as he should tarry there.

TONKIN. This church is a Vicarage, endowed, and passeth in the presentation with Gwendron. Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us that within this town was an hospital, But gives no further ac count of it : so that it is unknown to me whether it were a spital erected for the relief of pilgrims from abroad, or for the use of sick impoverished people within the town. Most assured I am that near this place there was a priory erected to the name of St. John the Baptist. THE EDITOR. I have omitted some paragraphs from Hals and from Tonkin respecting several derivations of the name \" Hel-"], [628, "158 HELSTON. stone,\" as all the circumstances of the place seem to point at one so decidedly as to exclude all consideration of the others. No doubt this one transgresses an arbitrary rule confining the themes of all derivations to a single lan guage; but the instances in contradiction are so numerous throughout all England, as to render this circumstance of no importance. The spot long used as a bowling-green is acknowledged on all hands to have been the site of an ancient castle. It must therefore have been the nucleus of the town ; and the marsh extending from the Loo Pool along the valley, passes under the scarped rampart of the castle. Hellas is well known to signify a marsh in the Celtic dialect used in Cornwall, and tbe termination Ton, the origin of our general word town, signified, in the Saxon, \u2014 more especially a walled town, or fortress; Helleston is therefore the fortress on the marsh. The first charter of incorporation given to Helston, at least from the supreme feudal chief, is said to have been by King John. It is, however, highly probable that privileges of guild may have been bestowed long before by the Princes of Cornwall, vassals from the time of Athelstan. Various other charters w-ere granted, till, in the early part of the reign of George III. the number of corporators became so reduced thai the remainder were incapable of performing any corpM ct ; a new charter was in con- sequence obtained, and the- ngxt general election the individuals nailed in it returned two members ; but six persons remaining of the fetfttj&kparty did the same : aud so strong at that period was flie feeling for chartered rights, in consequence ofthe conduct pursued by King Charles II. and his successor, that a committee of the House of Com mons determined the right to remain in this fragment, in capable of performing any other civil act.

When Edward set down before Calais, Replete with rage and with malice, Not the six famous burghers More courage displayed Than the six men of Helston. One, if not two more returns were made in the same manner, till the number being fallen down to two very old men, they were induced to wave their privilege, partly, it is said, from an apprehension entertained that the maxim of Roman law, tres faciunt collegiam, might be effectually urged against them. A custom had grown up at Helston, from early times, and by no means peculiar to that place, in compliance with which the patron, a well known and definite appellation, paid all the parochial rates ; but an opinion may be formed of their small amount at no distant period, from the following statement. The Editor being on a Committee of the House of Commons, to consider and report on the poor laws soon after the conclusion of the late war, laid be fore the Committee a copy of a poor rate made for a parish in the west of England in the year 1704 : it amounted to four pounds and some few shillings, while in the current year it exceeded six hundred pounds.

It appears never to have been thoroughly repaired ; and in 1763, Lord Godol phin, the patron, built a large church and a lofty tower, nearly on the site of the former. The church is without pillars, and capable of containing a numerous congrega tion ; but the whole is strongly characteristic of the bad taste prevalent at the period when it was erected. Just over the bridge leading to the westward stood the hospital dedicated to St. John, and founded by a member of the Killegrews. The spot is still marked by a large upright stone near the bridge, bearing the sword with its cros letted hilt, the cognizance ofthe military order of St. John. Little, however, is known about it. Dugdale states that at the dissolution in the 26th of Henry VIII. the total annual revenue of the house amounted to 14/. 7s. 4e?. and the actual receipts to 12/. 16s. Ad.

The Editor at that time repre sented Helston, and had the good fortune to assist mate rially in promoting the negociation with the Duchy officers, in consequence of his acquaintance with Mr. Sheridan, and with others whose consent was necessary to be obtained. The Market-house is a venerable monument of former times; yet, if this also could be removed, the improvement would equal that effected by the former. Helston, in great measure unconnected with trade or with a sea port, little of a thoroughfare before the turnpike road was made, surrounded by the residences of ancient, respectable, and wealthy families, and inhabited by gentle men of a similar description, has ever been celebrated for the superior quality of its social manners, and at the same time for an easy and familiar intercourse between all the people in their various stations ; the inferior experiencing the truth of what all the histories of all nations have con- firmed from the earliest periods of Greece to the recent events of our own time, Pip\\awit-\\ovTtov beiTTroritiy \u2014oWrj %apts' 'Oi o ov-kot eXmoavres, rj^rfnav koKios, Q,fioi re bovXois, irarra Kai Trapa arafyi?;*. And the reverse of A7raj de rpa^vs, oorts as veov Kparsn, These circumstances account for the continuance of old manners and of old customs longer here than in other places. All towns appear to have adopted, on one day at least in the year, practices similar to the Roman Saturnalia; in most places, the lines of society having become broad and strongly impressed, their observances descended to the more vulgar, or rather perhaps to the vicious ; and changing their character from harmless amusements to practices of"], [635, "165 HELSTON. outrage and violence, they have been discontinued or suppressed : but in Helston an ancient observance of this kind, refining with the refinement of the age, still continues in activity. The origins of all these customs are obscured or totally lost in their remote antiquity. That of Helston corres ponded, however, precisely with its name \u2014 \" a foray,\" locally corrupted into furray ; the young people rushed out of the town into the country early on the eighth of May, when, entering all houses without leave or ceremony, they ap peared to seize whatever they wanted, and from the real nature of the transactions, whatever they wanted was sure of being found ; and ultimately they returned to the town in triumph, dancing and decorated with flowers, where the scenes of the morning were, in some degree, repeated. All these practices, however, are less and less persevered in from year to' year, so that the whole is rapidly tending towards the single entertainment of a ball ; and if the ladies had succeeded in a classical fancy, which, some how or other, got possession of their minds, the very memory of this festival would have been lost. Not intimately acquainted, one may presume, with the true history of the patroness they had selected to sanction their gaieties, the goddess Flora was made to preside over a foray, instituted, as some assert, before the Norman con quest, and in commemoration of a victory obtained over the Saxons, who had landed at a cove still called Perth sasnac; but the utter absurdity of the substitution, and the popularity given to the word foray by Sir Walter Scott's Poems, have restored the ancient and true appel lation. Causes similar to those which have retained the foray, have also kept up the practice of bowling; so that in Helston alone can one now see the principal gentlemen of the town assembled on the bowling-green, enjoying at once exercise, fresh air, and agreeable intercourse, free from any"], [636, "166 HELSTON. spirit of gambling and from the slightest indulgence of a habit more common and less excusable. The word faddy is used to express the dance, the air, or both, used in celebrating the foray ; the origin of this term is quite unknown. The air is preserved by Edward Jones in his Musical and Poetical Relics of the Welsh Bards. He has also printed some lines which were sung by the dancers ; they are, however, so entirely devoid of sense, or even of anti quity, that I shall not transcribe them. The air is supposed to be a remnant of British music; one very like it, if not identically the same, has been found in Ireland, and according to report in Scotland. It may therefore be justly esteemed a curiosity. The measurement of Helston is included in Gwendron ; and the value of Real Property is not distinguished in the returns to Parliament from the parish.

HILARY. Mr. Hals begins his account of this parish with a long history ofthe patron saint, including all the controversies or disputed points of doctrine in which he was engaged ; all this, extending through many pages, is omitted. St. Hilary was born at Poictiers, in France, about the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century. He was descended from an illustrious family, and re ceived an education suited to his station in life, by which he was initiated into all the secular learning of those times ; but finding the Pagan mythology utterly absurd, and the prevalent system of philosophy quite unsatisfactory, he ex amined the Christian writings, and became a convert. He seems never to have adopted the brutalizing austerities so prevalent in those ages, but to have employed his talents, his acquired eloquence, and his learning, against the Arians and in defence of the Nicene creed. Several of his works are extant, and have gone through many editions. The whole were printed by the Benedictine Monks of Paris, \" St. Hilarii Opera omnia per Monachos Benedictinos edita; Gr. et Lat. Parisiis, 1693, Foi.\" Erasmus published the works of St. Hilary in 1544, and says in his Preface, \" Quicquid ingenio, quicquid eloquentia, quicquid sacra rum literarum cognitione posset ; \" and his contemporary, St. Jerome, says of him, \" Hilarius, meorum Confessor temporum, et Episcopus, duodecim Quintiliani libros et titulo imitatus est et numero;\" referring to his twelve books on the Trinity. In the judgment of modern critics his style at least is not thought worthy of all the praise bestowed on it by St. Jerome ; for, although it is stated to be lofty and noble, and moreover beautified with rhetorical ornaments and figures, yet it is too much studied and lengthened in many periods, so as to be obscure and even unintelligible."], [638, "168 ST. HILARY. The following passage on singleness of heart, has been cited by various authors. \" Christ teaches that only those who become again, as it were, little children, and by the simplicity of that age cut off the inordinate affections of vice, can enter into the kingdom of heaven. Those follow and obey their father, love their mother, are strangers to covetousness, ill-will, hatred, arrogance, lying, and are inclined easily to believe what they hear. This disposition of affection opens the way to heaven. We must therefore return to the sim plicity of little children, in which we shall bear some re semblance to our Lord's humility.\" From his commen tary on the Gospel of St. Matthew. St. Hilary, previous to his conversion, had married, and his family consisted of one daughter; he immediately separated himself from them ; his wife retired into a reli gious society. And after the saint had been consecrated Bishop of Poictiers in the year 355, he learned with the utmost horror and affright that his daughter was about to take on herself the unholy bonds of matrimony. His prompt and impassioned remonstrances conveyed in a letter which is printed among his works, conjuring her by the God of heaven not to act so unworthy a part, were suc cessful ; the marriage was broken off, and he had the gra tification of seeing his daughter, a spouse of Christ, expire not long after at his feet. St. Hilary composed a treatise which might in ordinary times have conciliated him to every sect then in existence. He there maintained that errors on speculative points of abstruse doctrine, were more sinful in the sight of God than any conduct the most atrocious; but controversy ran so high, and St. Hilary had taken a part so violent against the Arians, that even this merit could not save him from banishment, when that equally poised division of the church obtained some temporary preponderance in a synod, or succeeded in acquiring to their party the tem poral chief; who, without using the form of words, prac-"], [639, "ST. HILARY. 169 tically evinced that he was \" over all persons and over all causes, ecclesiastical as well as civil, within those his domi nions supreme.\" The saint, however, died at Poictiers in the year 368. St. Augustine relates many miracles wrought at his tomb; but the relics are said to have been removed to the Abbey of St. Denis, near Paris ; and his festival is kept on the 14th of January, although it is not certain either that he died, or that his relics were translated on that particular day. HALS. Hilary is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath upon the north St. Earth, west Gulval, [Ludgvan Editor,] east Germow, south and west the Mounts Bay and Peran uthno. As for the name Hilary, it is derived from the tutelar guardian and patron of this church, viz. St. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers in Gaul, the maul and hammer against the Arians, whose fame is eternized in the Roman agonals and festivals, though his memory and day is not celebrated as a martyr, but as one of the principal confessors of the Roman church ; that is to say, one of those that suffered great per secution for the name and Gospel of Christ Jesus.

Treveneage, in this parish, was formerly the lands of Sir Thomas Arundell, of Tolverne, Knight, who sold this barton and manor to Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongallan, knight, whose son and heir, John Hals, sold it to Walker of Exeter; from whose heirs it came by purchase to Sir Joseph Tredinham, Knight, now in possession thereof. On the confines of this parish is situate the ancient ma nor and borough of Marazion.(o) In Domesday Roll, 20 th William I. 1087, this place was taxed by the name of Tremarastoll ; that is to say, the cell, chapel, or hole market-town ; situate in a remote corner, vallum, or pit, upon the seashore of St. Michael's Mount. At which time, no doubt, the Abbat or Prior of St. Michael's Mount (as they were afterwards till 26th Henry VIII. when that Abbey was dissolved), were lords and high lords thereof; when it was privileged with the jurisdiction of a court leet; as afterwards, temp. Henry II. with sending two of its members to sit in the Commons' House of Parliament. But, as appears from the Parliament Rolls in the Tower of London, after the dissolution of the Abbey or Priory aforesaid, this town neglected to send its Members, \" for that it could not conveniently pay its bur gesses their daily wages, propter paupertatem, which are the words of the record.

And as a further mark of its ancient grandeur, I take it still to be an incorporate mayor or portreeve town; but more sure I am, that, as some other petty corporations' names in Cornwall are adjectives merged or fallen in or upon the parishes wherein they are situate, as Camel ford, Mitchell, &c. this town is a noun substantive, and stands charged by itself in the Exchequer to the 4s. per pound Land Tax, 1696, by the name of the borough of Maraszeyan, 76/. 12s. 6c?. In the beginning of the reign of King Henry VIII. (1514) when war had been proclaimed against the French King, a fleet of French men of war, consisting of thirty sail, with some marine regiments of soldiers therein, coasting in our British Channel, at length came into this Mount's Bay, and there dropped anchor ; when soon after they landed a con siderable number, or quantity, of seamen and soldiers, and marched in hostile manner towards this town. Which the inhabitants observing, they forsook their houses, and fled to the hill country ; whereby the Frenchmen became peaceably possessed thereof, and plundered the same for some days, till they understood that John Carminow, of Fentongollan, Esq. was coming or marching towards them, with his posse comitatus, to give them battle ; when instantly they set the town on fire, and the houses on the contiguous part of the country, and burnt the same totally to the ground, to the great loss and damage of the inhabitants, and forthwith fled to their ships for safety and protection ; and thereupon their ships hoisted anchors and put forth to sea again. Where they had not long been till Sir Anthony Oughthred, King Henry VIII.'s Admiral at sea, with a squadron of thirty men of war, met and gave them battle, to their great loss of men and some ships of war, whilst the rest of their fleet ran away, and fled into the haven of Brest for safety and protection."], [642, "172 ST. HILARY. THE HISTORY' OF ST. MICHAEL'S MOUNT. PART I. So called, for that our ancestors, the Britons, appre hended the appearance of the Archangel St. Michael, about the year of our Lord 495, was in this place, though the Italians say it was upon Mount Garganus, in their country, and the Frenchmen tell us that it was upon their Mount St. Michael, in Normandy; such difference amongst writers is about it ; and verily this matter of fact is worth contending for, since the etymology of Michael is \" sicut Deus,\" i. e. as God, as I have shewn elsewhere under other churches to him dedicated. It appears from the history of the church of Landaflj as Mr. Camden hath observed, that this mount was called Dinsill, and Dinsull, but what those words should signify he could not tell.(c) Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 154, tells us, that beside those religious appellations that were given to it, it was called in British, Cara cowz in clouz, which he interprets as the Grey rock in the flood, a corruption of Carra cio gris en an coos; i. e. rock-clo-grey in the wood.(c?) Of this place Mr. Carew, and Mr. Camden that trode in his steps, tells us, that it was the Ocrinum, OKpivvft, or Ocrinium of Ptolomy and Atticus, the Greek geogra phers; and yet Camden, in another place, fixes that name on the Lizard Point. This Mount is comparatively a pyramidal crag, con taining about seven acres of land in compass ; at the foot whereof, towards the land, is a level piece of ground covered with grass, where there is a wharf, or key, for landing goods and merchandize from the sea ; also some dwelling houses and fish-cellars, and a cemetery for burying the dead. To this Mount the sea daily makes its flux and re flux, and affords safe riding and anchorage to boats, barks, and barges, with some winds. And that which tends more tc the convenience and security of this place, that at low water it is all part of the insular continent of Britain, and"], [643, "st. Michael's mount. 173 at full sea an island of itself. To which purpose thus speaks Mr. Carew out of the Cornish Wonder Gatherer : Who knows not Migell's Mount and chair, 'Ihe pilgrim's holy vaunt; Both land and island twice a day, Both fort and port of haunt. For to this Mount and chapel of St. Michael devout Christians in former ages came as pilgrims from the furthest part of this land, with rich offerings and oblations to St. Michael's altar, Abbat, or Prior; also tradition tells us that in former ages this mount was parcel of the solid lands of this parish of St, Hilary, and severed or disjointed from it by some earthquake, terrestrial concussion, or inun dation of the sea ; and to prove this, it is alleged that in the Mount's Bay, after some great tempests, the bodies and roots of oak-trees have been discovered in the sand, broken up by the surges of the sea ; the like observation is made by Camden and Lhuyd on the sea shores of Pembrokeshire, and I myself, and many others, in the moors of Calestock Veor, Calestock Rule, Rheese, and Polgoda in Peransand, have seen and found, deep under ground, far from the sea, in the fens and turf lands, the bodies and roots of several oak trees, the hearts whereof were firm and solid. But whether those seas Were formerly dry land, and the fens aforesaid the places where these trees grew (none in those parts being now to be seen there), let others resolve; or rather whether they are not subterraneous trees, that grew or are generated there, as some philosophers hold and teach, under the earth. From the foot of Mount St. Michael you ascend the hill or rock through a narrow, crooked, craggy path to the outer portal or gate ; a considerable height on the one side, by the way in the rock, is a small spring of water, that falls into pits made in the stones to lodge the same, for the lower or bottom inhabitants' use ; which water never in termits its currrent. Above the second gate there is an-"], [644, "174 ST. HILARY. other spring of water issuing out of the rocks, that makes a pretty confluence for six or seven winter months, and then intermits, which renders the portage of it upwards much the easier for the inhabitants' use in that season. After you pass through this second gate, betwixt a winding and crooked path, artificially cut in the rocks on the north side thereof, and follow the same, you arrive to the top of this Mount, where towards the north-west is a kind of level plain, about four or six land-yards, which gives a full pros- pect of the Mount's Bay, the British Ocean, Penzance town, Newlyn, Moushole, Gulvall, Maddarn, Paul, and other parishes, over a downright precipice of rocks towards the sea, at least twenty fathoms high. From this little square or plain, there is an artificial kind of ascent also going towards the east, which offers you a full sight of the outer walls of the castle, and brings you to Porth-Horne, (i. e. the Iron Gate) part of which is yet to be seen. This little fortress comprehendeth sufficient rooms and lodgings for the captain or governor and his soldiers to' reside in, to which adjoining are several other houses or cells, hereto- fore pertaining to the monks that dwelt here; all admir- able for their strength, buildings, and contrivance, on the top of a rock naturally fortified : so that a small number of soldiers, having provision and ammunition, might defend themselves against the greatest armies in former ages, though I confess now, since the art of war is grown to greater perfection in mischief and destruction, a few cannon or bombs from the opposite hills would soon shatter it to pieces. On this Mount, King Edward the Confessor, anno Dom. 1044, founded and endowed an Abbey or Priory of Bene dictine Monks, that is to say Augustines reformed, with a little chapel yet standing, and dedicated the same to the Archangel St. Michael, part whereof is now converted to a dwelling house, in w7hich there is yet to be seen cut in stone three or four coats of arms, one of which was, as I remember, a Chevron between three fleurs-de-lis."], [645, "st. Michael's mount. 175 That it had at that time considerable revenues belong ing to it I make no question, since in the Domesday Book, 20 William I. 1087, Lan-migell was then taxed, that is to say Michael's church or Temple, as aforesaid. But that which renders this place most famous is the pre sent church or chapel and tower, cemetery, and cells cut in the rocks for hermetical monks of the order aforesaid ; built and further endowed by William Earl of Morton and Cornwall, yet extant and kept in good repair, with pews; to whose father, Robert Earl of Morton, King William the Conqueror had given the lands of many rebels in those parts, and in particular this Mount, with its appurtenances, (dedicated as aforesaid) and created him Earl of Cornwall, whose successors held the same by tenure of Knight Service till temp. Charles II. Of which sort of tenures there were lately extant, in the hundred of Penwith, thirteen knight's sees. \u2014 Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 39. And in other hundreds three hundred more in Cornwall. Upon the tower of this church or chapel, for it is bigger than many other Cornish parish churches, is that celebrated place called Kader Migell, i. e. Michael's Chair, viz. a kind of seat artificially made or cut in the stones on the top of its tower, very dangerous in the access and tre mendous to behold. Contrary to this description, Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 154, tells us that St. Michael's Chair is a bad seat, in a craggy place without the castle, dangerous for the access and therefore holy for the adventure ; so that I conceive he had this report by hearsay, not ocular de monstration. In this chapel are yet to be seen the tomb stones of several persons there interred, in the rocks, (with a small quantity of earth, though without the chapel there is a bank of earth, brought there by art for burying the dead,) but the inscriptions on those tombstones are so obliterated with dust and time, that I had not leisure much to examine them. The roof and timber of this temple is yet so firm and uniformly kept in repair, that no decay,"], [646, "176 ST. HILARY. moth, or spider's web are to be seen in the roof thereof, which gives occasion to a conjecture that the same was all built of Irish oak, which drives that poisonous creature the spider from it. Certes, this fabrick is not only an evi dent proof of the great skill which former ages, in William the Conqueror's days, had in the art of architecture, but that many other such of much later erection can hardly equal the same, though it has stood firm above six hundred years. This abbey or priory of Benedictine Monks of St. Mi chael, after the donation thereof by the Conqueror to his nephew Robert Earl of Morton aforesaid, was by him an nexed and made subject for religious matters to the Abbey of Mount St. Michael in Normandy, under which circum stance it stood till the French wars, temp. Henry V. 1414, when the Statute, made 1380, in the reign of King Richard II. was put in force, for suppressing alien priories (who secretly communicated the state affairs to foreigners). King Henry V. or VI. then gave this Alien Priory of St. Michael to Sion Abbey in Middlesex, under which rule and jurisdiction it remained till 26 Henry VIII., 1533, when it was dissolved ; when, I take it, it passed in value with Sion, since the Monasticon Anglicanum does not mention it separate. The Mount is now in possession of Sir John Saintaubyn, (formerly Bassett) who for melancholy retirement dwelleth here. It is still privileged with royalties over the Mount's Bay, as far north as Long Bridge in the manor of Lane- sely, with wrecks, anchorage of ships, quayage or wharfage of goods, and with keeping annual fairs on the sea shore near it, September 29, Monday after Midlent Sunday. Round this Mount, for two leagues space, is an indifferent safe road for anchorage of ships, when the wind is proper for it; and here, as Froissart saith, landed Sir Robert Knollys, a valiant commander of the Black Prince's in the French wars temp.

This Mount, from the time of King Edward the Con- fessor to the middle of the reign of King Richard I. for the space of 150 years, was a sacred nursery of religion ; but then, notwithstanding the sanctity thereof, and the guardianship of St. Michael, it was seized by one Henry de la Pomeray, Lord of Berry- Pomeray in Devon, and Tregony Pomeray in this county, being distasted at the go- vernment of King Richard I. as many others were, by reason of the Pope's request he engaged in the Holy War, and forsook his kingdom, leaving for his vicegerent Wil- liam Longchamp, a Norman Bishop of Ely ; who had ex- torted great sums of money from the people in his absence, without a Parliament ; and moreover so insulted over the nobility and gentry of this kingdom in his office, that he discontented the greatest part of them; and to countenance his grandeur he seldom rode abroad with less than a thousand attendants. Those and others his exorbitances gave occasion to John Earl of Cornwall and others to fall into treasonable practices, and of this number it seems this Sir Pomeray was one, who not only informed the King beyond the seas of these topping, magisterial, and illegal practices of Long- champ at home, but that by reason thereof King Philip of France, in those distractions, took occasion with a great army of soldiers to invade Normandy, and had taken the town of Guisors and many other places by force and arms, and would reduce the whole province in short while (if not resisted) to his dominion. Whereupon the King, in an swer, by his letters patent, deposed Longchamp from his VOL. II. N"], [648, "178 ST. HILARY'. authority, and placed the Archbishop of Rouen in his place, when soon after Longchamp, in women's apparel, made his escape into his own country, but was detected and shrewdly beaten with rods before his departure out of England, bv the women there. D t r Longchamp, as tradition saith, having notice that de la Pomeray was in confederacy with Earl John, who under pretence of opposing his vice-government, designed the usurpation of King Richard's Crown, (though he had told him that in case his brother should die, before he returned into his kingdom, without issue, that the right of succes sion was in Arthur Duke of Britany, his elder brother's son, not him,) sent a sergeant at arms to the castle of Berry Pomeray in Devon, where he then resided, in order to ar rest and take him into custody, which he no sooner did but Pomeray stabbed him to the heart, of which wound he instantly died. Upon which tragical accident the mur derer fled into Cornwall, where he had great possessions in lands, and besides twelve lordships held by the tenure of knight service. And there cast himself upon his amicus, John Earl of that province, who as tradition saith secretly supplied him with divers men at arms to secure his person against his enemy the Viceroy, which accordingly they did till Longchamp was displaced. Afterwards, notice being given that King Richard was taken prisoner coming from the Holy War, 1194, by Leo pold, Archduke of Austria in Germany, and cast into his prison called Trivalis, in which no man before was known to be put that escaped with life, this news prompted Pome ray from the sin of murder to that of rebellion ; resoiving to reduce this Mount of St. Michael to Earl John's domi nion, and to place himself therein for better safety. In order to which he found out this expedient, to go with his guard of armed men that daily attended him in disguise to that place, under pretence of visiting a sister that he had amongst the religious people there ;(e) who upon discovering who he was, and the occasion of his coming, had the gates"], [649, "st. Michael's mount. 179 opened, where he entered with his followers, who soon after discovered under their clothes their weapons of war, and declared their design was for reducing the Mount to the dominion and use of John Earl of Cornwall, and that if any person opposed them therein, they would revenge it upon him to the loss of their lives; whereupon, he com manded the Prior and his monks to deliver him the keys of the gates, and possession of the houses thereof for com mon uses, though therein they much discommoded the monks with their soldiers. Nevertheless, for fear of greater damage, they patiently submitted to his pleasure; who thereupon with his soldiers fortified the place, and so made it comparatively impregnable, and so there lived in great pomp and triumph for some time, not expecting ever to hear that King Richard was in the land of the living, or delivered from prison, it being for some time reported he was dead. But, alas ! many times common fame is a com mon liar, and all men are apt to believe such matters and things as they would willingly have come to pass, or stand well affected to. But contrary to the expectation of Pomeray and his confederates, King Richard, after fifteen months' durance in prison, was ransomed for one hundred thousand pounds, and returned safe to London ; when he sound his brother John formidable, and making way to his crown, having got possession of the castles of Lancaster, Marlborough, Nottingham, St. Michael's Mount, and other fortresses, into which he had placed governors and soldiers. Where upon, in order to reduce those places, King Richard raised a considerable army ; at the news whereof Earl John fled into France, and was by his brother deprived of all his possessions in England : notwithstanding which, the garri sons aforesaid stood firm to Earl John's interest, till at the siege of Vernoil in Normandy, he fled from the French army to that of his brother, threw down his arms and sub mitted to his mercy; whereupon he was restored to all his lands and dignities, both in Normandy and England. n 2"], [650, "180 ST. HILARY. But notwithstanding this concord and agreement between King Richard and his brother John, the castles aforesaid stood out, and would not surrender for some time after, es pecially this Mount, which Pomeray commanded. Where upon King Richard commanded Richard Revel], then sheriff of Cornwall, with his posse comitatus, to assist Hu bert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor of England, whom he had sent as his general into Cornwall to besiege St. Michael's Mount, and reduce Pomeray to his duty and allegiance ; which army of men, and bands of soldiers, no sooner approached the same (as Hoveden saith) and gave him summons, but the sight of the numerous army he was to contend with so affrighted Pomeray and his confederates, that forthwith, without resistance, he surrendered the garrison on mercy to the said Walter, for the use of King Richard, 1194, at the consideration of which and his other facts, through trouble of mind he soon after died, as despairing of pardon. Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us, by re port of some of his posterity, that he made his will and bequeathed part of his lands to the monks of St. Michael's Mount, others to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, to pray for his soul ; the remainder descended to his heir (which we have no reason to doubt of, since Henry de la Pomeray, one of his posterity, 3 Henry IV. at Tregony, held twelve knights' fees of land in Cornwall, id. Mr. Carew) ; having so done, he caused himself to be blooded to death, to make his bequests good and valid in law; after his death King Richard restored the prior and his monks to the full possession of their cells, revenues, and chapel; and in de la Pomeray's fort, he placed a small garrison of soldiers, to defend the same against sudden invasion of ene mies; and in this condition St. Michael's Mount remained from the year 1196 to the year 1471, 275 years, manned but with carnal and spiritual soldiers.

Richard de Vere, the eleventh Earl of Oxford, married Alice, one of the daughters and coheirs of Sir Richard Sergeaulx, knight, Lord of Collquite and Killygarth, widow of Guy Seyntaubyn, Sheriff of Cornwall 22 Richard II. 1399; but she passed her lands from her son by her first husband, to her second husband the Earl of Oxford, who had issue by her John de Vere, the 12th Earl of Oxford, who married Elizabeth,\" daughter of Sir John Howard Knight; the which John, the 12th Earl, was the chief of those barons that opposed the prece dence in parliament ofthe Lords Spiritual, temp. Henry VI. the which Parliament roll in the Tower of London, is thus endorsed : Memorandum. \u2014 The Lords Spiritual alleged that, for asmuch as they were spiritual Barons, they ought to have the right of precedence of the Lords Temporal, for it was well known how far things spiritual exceeded carnal or temporal. To which this Earl of Oxford replied on behalf of the Lords Temporal, that whatsoever right or privilege they had or could challenge, [see Brooke on Oxford, Earl,] it came from them and their ancestors, and their alms deeds, who had been the worthy founders and benefactors of the Lords Spiritual ; and further said it was an unseemly thing for masters to be inferior to their servants, who were descended of regal, honourable, and noble families, which most of the Spiritual Barons were not ; which matter being fully understood, and indifferently heard, the Lords Tem poral, by means of the logic and rhetoric of this Earl, had then the precedence of place in Parliament given them. But, alas! this bold demand, question, and argument of his, at that time, was a project rather pitied than admired by his best friends, for though it succeeded well in one Par liament, it got him many enemies in another. So that in the Parliament, held 2d November, 1462, tempore Edward"], [652, "182 8T. HILARY. IV., this Earl, and his son Aubrey, were attainted of treason against that King, on the behalf of Henry VL, and both beheaded without trial or answer.\u2014 (Baker's Chronicle, page 204.) Whereupon John, his second son, succeeded, and was the 13th Earl of Oxford, who married Margaret daughter of Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, who, as his father had done before, adhered to the interest of King Henry VI. , against Edward IV., and was at the battle of Barnet Heath 1471, and had, with the Marquess Montacute, the command of the right wing of King Henry's horse, under Richard Earl of Warwick, general of his army ; and when in the battle, it appeared the van ward of King Henry's horse had somewhat worsted King Edward's party, by the valour of the Earl of Oxford, the news presently fled to London that Warwick had obtained the victory ; but, alas ! Fama est mendax; for immediately after a strange misfor tune befel the Earl of Oxford and his men in the latter part of this encounter. They having a star with streams on their liveries, as King Edward's soldiers had the sun, the General Warwick's men, by reason of a great mist, (raised as was thought by the magic art of Friar Bungey) mis taking the badges, shot at the Earl of Oxford's men, which were of their own party, to their great hurt and destruc tion ; whereupon the Earl, seeing how matters went, cried out treason, and forthwith fled with j|)0 men, whose de parture gave King Edward opportuBfcy to obtain a total victory over his enemies. \u2122 Whereupon the Duke of Somerset and this Earl of Ox- ford fled to Jasper Earl of Pembroke, in Wales, for safety and protection ; from whence Oxford, and a convenient number of men of arms, shipped themselves from Milford haven, and with a fair wind sailed down St. George's Channel, turned the Land's End, and came safely at an chor in this Mount's Bay. Where, as soon as the Earl and his men had disguised themselves in pilgrims' and friars' apparel, under which all had lodged a small sword"], [653, "st. Michael's mount. 183 and a dagger, they went on shore, pretending that they were pilgrims that had come a long pilgrimage from the remotest part of this kingdom, to perform the penance im posed upon them by their father confessors, and to perform their vows, make orisons and oblations to the altar of St. Michael, who presided there ; upon which pious pre text the monks and inhabitants opened their gates and let them into the castle, where they were no sooner entered, but, as de la Pomeray had done before, they shewed their weapons, discovered their impious fraud, and made known who they were, and their designs to kill all persons that made resistance or opposed King Henry VI. for whom the Earl of Oxford was come to take possession of this Mount, and would keep it to his use ; whereupon, the monks and the small garrison were necessitated to comply with their demands, and yield them a quiet possession thereof; which forthwith the Earl put in better repair, and by the interest of King Henry and the Earl's friends and relations in those parts, his grandmother as aforesaid being Sir Guy St. Aubyn's widow and Sergeaulx's coheir, he soon got ammu nition, provision, and soldiers sufficient for their defence. As soon as King Edward IV. heard of the surprise of St. Michael's Mount by the Earl of Oxford, he issued forth his proclamation, proclaiming him and all his ad- herents traitors, and then consulted how to regain both to his obedience ; and in order thereto he forthwith sent to Sir John Arundell of Trerice, Knight, then Sheriff of Cornwall, to reduce and besiege the same by his posse comitatus ; which gentleman, pursuant to his orders, and by virtue of his office, soon rose a considerable army of men and soldiers within his bailiwick, and marched with them towards St. Michael's Mount, where being arrived he sent a trumpeter to the Earl with a summons of surrender of that garrison to him for King Edward upon mercy; espe cially for that in so doing, in all probability, he would pre vent the effusion of much Christian blood. To this summons of the trumpeter the Earl sent a flat"], [654, "184 ST. HILARY. denial ; saying further, that rather than he would yield the sort on those terms, himself and those with him were all resolved to lose their lives in defence thereof. Whereupon the Sheriff commanded his soldiers, being very numerous on all parts, to storm the Mount, and reduce it by force ; but, alas ! maugre all their attempts (of this kind) the besieged so well defended every part of this rocky mountain that in all places the Sheriffs men were repulsed with some loss ; and the besieged issued forth from the outer gate and pursued them with such violence, that the said Sir John Arundell and some others were slain upon the sands at the foot of the Mount, to the great discouragement of the new raised soldiers, who quickly departed thence, having lost their leader ; leaving the besieged in better heart than they found them, as much elevated at their good success as themselves were dismayed at their bad fortune. This Sir John Arundel], as Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us, p. 119, had long before been told by some fortune teller that he should be slain in the sands ; wherefore, to avoid that destiny, he removed from Efford, near Stratton on the sands, where he dwelt, to Trerice, far off from the sea-sands, yet by this misfortune fulfilled the prediction in another place. King Edward, upon news of this tragical accident, forth with ordered letters patent to be drawn for making John Fortescue, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall, in the place of Sir John Arundel], slain as aforesaid ; who being accordingly sworn in that office, received the same commands, and took the same measures for reducing the Mount as the former Sheriff had done, by summons and assault, but was always, and in all places, repulsed with dishonour and loss, the same being as stoutly defended within as it was assaulted without; the fort thus appearing invincible. All which cir cumstances being transmitted to King Edward by Mr. Fortescue, the Sheriff, the King, for prevention of further bloodshed, ordered him to have a parley with the said Earl of Oxford, and know what his designs and expectations"], [655, "st. Michael's mount. 185 were ; who thereupon sent a messenger to him for that purpose; from whom he received this resolute and des perate answer, \u2014 that, if the King would pardon the offences of him and his adherents, and grant them their lives, liber ties, and estates, that then he would yield up the fort to his use ; otherwise they would fight it out to the last man. Which answer being sent up to the King, he granted their request ; and forthwith ordered a proclamation of free pardon to be made unto them, under the broad seal of England ; which, with all convenient speed was sent down, and by Mr. Sheriff Fortescue delivered to the Earl, to the great quiet and content of all parties. Whereupon the fort was yielded to him for the King's use ; and the Earl of Oxford was soon after sent prisoner to the castle of Hamms, in Normandy, where he was continued a prisoner till the first year of King Henry VII. 1485, with whom he came into England, and led the vanward of his army at Bos worth Field against King Richard III. where he was slain. After the death of this Earl's first wife, he married Eliza beth, daughter of Sir Richard Scrope, Knight, widow of William Lord Beaumont, by whom he had no issue; so that, he dying the 4th Henry VIII. left John, the son of George Vere his brother, his heir and successor, and the fourteenth Earl of Oxford, who gave for his arms, Gules, escartelle de Or, le premier brise d'un molette de Argent. King Edward attributed this ineffectual long siege of St. Michael's Mount either to the cowardice or disloyalty of the Sheriffs and country people of Cornwall ; but there was no just cause for this conjecture, since Sir John Arun dell and several of his men lost their lives about it: at other times, he would say the inhabitants were more affected to the house of Lancaster than that of York ; whereupon, when the said Mr. Fortescue went out of his office after four years' service, he made his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester Sheriff of Cornwall during life ; for that he was often heard to say he looked upon Cornwall only as the"], [656, "186 ST. HILARY. back-door of rebellion; so that those several persons set down in the catalogue of Sheriffs of Cornwall after For tescue, were not absolute Sheriffs, but Deputies under the said Duke, viz.

King cf Scotland, upon a truce with King Henry VII. of England, had expulsed from Scotland that counterfeit sham Prince, Perkin Warbeck (the pretended Richard of Shrewsbury, youngest son of King Edward IV. who had before been murdered in the Tower), to whom he had given in marriage his near kinswoman the Lady Katherine Gordon ; he, together with his wife and family, sailed from thence over into Ireland, to seek friendship there of the rebels and all others well affected to the House of York ; where being arrived, and fortune favouring him according to his expectation, news was brought him there that the Cornish rebels were ready to renew their former hostility, and venture their lives in battle upon the title of the house of York against that of Lancaster, had they a valiant and able General to lead them, notwithstanding Flammock and his confederates under the same engagement were defeated and executed in 1495. These tidings were very acceptable to Perkin ; who thereupon consulted his privy councillors, Hearn, Astley, and Skelton, a mercer, a tailor, and a scrivener, all bank rupts ; these all agree, nemine contradicente, that his four ships of war should forthwith be rigged and manned for an expedition into Cornwall; which accordingly being pre pared, himself with his lady, and 120 soldiers, embarked thereon, and being favoured with a fair wind, took his leave of his Irish friends, and in the month of September, 1499, 15th Henry VII. (Carew's Survey of Cornwall,"], [657, "st. Michael's mount. 187 p. 98,) came safely to anchor in St. Michael's Mount's Bay; where soon after he landed, and went up to the Mount, and made himself known to the monks and other inhabitants, publishing himself to be the true and real Richard of Shrewsbury aforesaid, the true heir of the House of York; which the monks, greatly affected to that title, were so very ready to believe, that they yielded the Mount and garrison without resistance into his hands ; who pre sently renewed the old fortifications, and put the same into a better posture of defence. Which having done, himself with a band of soldiers marched from thence to Bodmin (where the rendezvous of Flammock's rebels in those parts formerly was,) in which place, by false words and promises, he so prevailed with the discontented rebels of that town and contiguous country, that he soon got together, without money or reward, at least three thousand men that could bear arms ; these he divided into companies, and bands, and regiments, under Captains, Majors, and Colonels expert in war to instruct them in military discipline, till at length his army grew to six thousand well-armed soldiers. Whereupon King Henry VII. having notice of Perkin's landing and formidable ness in these parts, ordered Sir Peter Edgecombe, Knight, then Sheriff of Cornwall (whose father, Sir Richard Edge combe, Knight, was one of that King's Privy Councillors, and had comparatively been raised to his great estate by his boon and favour), that he should forthwith, by virtue of his office, raise the country, and give battle to this coun terfeit Richard of Shrewsbury and his confederate rebels. Whereupon, the Sheriff did as he was commanded, and raised an army of twenty thousand men, as tradition saith, and led them towards Bodmin ; but when they approached near, and saw Perkin entrenched at Castle Keynock, on the east hill of Bodmin Downs, with the body of his army, and divers troops of horse and bands of foot placed to- wards Lanhydrock and the roads from Cardenham, in order to resist and oppose the Sheriff, his men resolved to"], [658, "188 ST. HILARY. march no further, but to return from whence they came without giving battle. Which accordingly they did (not withstanding the Sheriff's threats and commands to the contrary), in great terror aud confusion and astonishment; but whether this fear proceeded from the cowardice of the Sheriff and his men, or their disaffection to the Lancastrian dominion of King Henry, is uncertain, for the like fact was committed two years before by the posse comitatus of John Basset, of Tehidy, then Sheriff, which he had raised to suppress Flammock's rebellion. Upon news of this flight and disbanding of the Sheriff's men, Perkin was saluted by his soldiers and confederates as King of England : and soon after, not only in his camp, but in divers places of Bodmin town, was proclaimed by a trumpeter and others, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, with great shouts and acclamations of the people, and bonefires, by the name of Richard IV. And it is reported he assumed majesty with such a boon grace and affable deportment, that immediately he won the af fections and admiration of all who made addresses unto him ; in which art of kingship he had long before been educated and instructed by his pretended aunt, Margaret Duchess of Burgundy, sister to King Edward IV. which he had also acted to the good liking of all that saw him in Burgundian, Irish, Scots, and French courts. And, more over, besides his magisterial port and mien, being an in comparable counterfeit, natural crafty, liar and dissembler, \" Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare,\" as the old pro verb saith ; so that in short time he grew to be so popular and formidable about Bodmin that no power durst oppose him there. But, alas! this Cornish regniculum gave him not content, for his pride and ambition put him upon fur ther expedients, viz. to get possession of the whole king dom of England, and reduce it also to his obedience ; in order to which, with a well-prepared army of four thousand men and two thousand of other sorts, he marched out of Cornwall into Devon, where met him also great numbers"], [659, "st. Michael's mount. 189 of volunteers of that county and Somerset, that joined with his forces; the dread whereof so terrified James Chud leigh, Esq. then Sheriff of Devon, and the power of his bailiwick raised to stop his march to Exeter, that they durst not give him battle or obstruct his passage till he came before that city, pitched his camp, and laid siege thereto. Upon whose approaches the citizens shut their gates and prepared to defend themselves ; when soon after he sent a message or summons to them in the name of Richard IV. King of England, commanding them to surrender the same to him upon their allegiance: but the citizens so ridiculed his pretended title, and slighted his summons, that by his own messenger they gave him defiance ; at which time Dr. Richard Redman was Lord Bishop of Exeter ; William Burgoigne, Esq. Recorder; William Frost, Mayor; Francis Gilbert, Sword-bearer; John Bucknam, William Wilkin son, John Doncaster, and Richard Howse, were Stewards, or Bailiffs ; John Clodworthy, John Bonifant, Philip Bul lock, John Wilkin, Nicholas Auburne, John Atwell, Wil liam York, Thomas Lanwordaby, Philip Binks, John Slugg, Thomas Andrews, Thomas Oliver, and others, Aldermen. See Isaack's Memorials of Exeter, 1499. Soon after this defiance given, Perkin and his soldiers surrounded the city walls, and attempted to scale the same in several places daily for some time, but always were re pulsed with considerable loss by the valour of the citizens. During which siege they sent to King Henry for his aid and assistance in this great distress ; whereupon the Lord Daubeny was ordered to raise forces and march towards Exeter therewith, in order to remove the siege thereof; but before he came, Edward Courtenay, sixteenth Earl of Devon, and the Lord William his son, accompanied with Sir Edmund Carew, Sir Thomas Fulford, Sir William Courtenay, Sir John Hal well, Sir John Croker, Walter Courtenay, Peter Edgecombe, William St. Maur, Richard Whiteleigh of Efford (Sheriff of Devon the year after),"], [660, "190 ST. HILARY. Richard Hals of Kenedon, John Fortescue of Vallapit, James Chudleigh aforesaid, and other gentlemen of those parts, had raised a considerable army of soldiers, with which they marched towards the rebels. At the sight of whose approach Perkin and his host were as much dispirited then as they were elevated before ; whereupon he called a council of war, in which it was unanimously agreed upon, that it was not advisable to give them battle, being at least ten thousand fighting men, but to dislodge from their trenches, and leave the siege of that place, and forthwith to march into Somersetshire, a country better affected to King Perkin, where he might raise more soldiers. Accordingly, this order of council was observed and put in practice, so that the night after Perkin and all his army marched to wards Taunton ; where he mustered his men as if he in tended to give battle ; but when, by the muster-roll, he saw what numbers of men had deserted him in his nightly march from Exeter, falling then much short of six thousand, and further, notice being brought him that King Henry was in pursuit of him with a much greater army, he foresaw the worst, and doubted that fortune would favour him no longer in his military and regal practices ; and therefore contrived, for the preservation of himself, with sixty horse troopers, to forsake his army by night, and fly to the Abbey of Beauley, in Southampton, as resting upon the name and privilege of the place, where he took sanctuary. As soon as King Henry understood Perkin had deserted his soldiers and had taken sanctuary at Beauley, he forthwith ordered a band of soldiers to guard and surround that Abbey to prevent his escape beyond the seas (from whence it ap pears that at that time the privilege of sanctuary was allowed to traitors). So that Perkin, despairing of getting thence, submitted to the King's mercy, and was committed prisoner to the Tower of London ; from whence he made an escape, and fled to the Priory of Sheen, at Richmond ; where, on condition of making a true confession who he was, in a pair of stocks set before Westminster Hall door, and true an-"], [661, "st. Michael's mount. 191 swer make to such questions as should be demanded of him, the Prior got the King's pardon for him. And ac cordingly, he sat in the stocks a whole day before West minster Hall door, afterwards on a scaffold in Cheapside, openly reading, declaring, and giving manuscripts under his own hand, wherein he told his parentage, the place of his birth, the passages of his life; that he was a cheat, an impostor, and by what ways and means he was drawn into those treasonable and bloody attempts and practices, Sec. After which he was again committed to the Tower of Lon don, where endeavouring to make an escape, he was after wards, with others, executed at Tyburn. After Perkin took sanctuary at Beauley, his soldiers from about Taunton and elsewhere, were all brought to Exeter ; where King Henry, in St. Peter's church-yard, pardoned them all, on their promise of being good subjects afterwards. But some of them were not so good as their word. King Henry also then sent the Lord Daubeny to St. Michael's Mount for Perkin 's wife, the Lady Katherine Gordon, whom he brought to King Henry ; who commiserating her youth, birth, and beauty, bestowed a competent mainte nance upon her, which she enjoyed during that King's life and long after, to her dying day. part v. This Priory, or Abbey, being dissolved by act of Par liament, and given to the King, 33d Henry VIII. 1542, he gave the revenues and government of the place to Humphry Arundell, Esq. of the Lanherne family, who en joyed the same till the first year of King Edward VI. 1549; at which time that King set forth several injunctions about religion : amongst others, this was one, viz. that all images found in churches, for divine worship or otherwise, should be pulled down and cast forth out of those churches; and that all preachers should perswade the people from praying to \u00b0aints or for the dead ; and from the use of beads, ashes."], [662, "192 ST. HILARY. processions, masses, dirges, and praying to God publicly in an unknown tongue ; and least there should be a defect of preachers as to those points, homilies were made and ordered to be read in all churches. Pursuant to this in junction one Mr. Body, a commissioner for pulling down images in the churches of Cornwall, going to do his duty in Helston church, a priest, in company with Killtor of Kevorne and others, at unawares stabbed him in the body with a knife ; of which wound he instantly fell dead in that place. And though the murderer was taken and sent up to London, tried, found guilty of wilful murder in West minster Hall, and executed in Smithfield, yet the Cornish people flocked together in a tumultuous and rebellious manner by the instigation of their priests in diverse parts of the shire or county, and committed many barbarities and outrages in the same; and though the justices of the peace apprehended several of them, and sent them to jail, yet they could not with all their power suppress the growth of their insurrection ; for soon after Humphry Arundell aforesaid, Governor of this Mount, sided with those mu tineers, and broke out into actual rebellion against his and their Prince. The mutineers chose him for the General of their army, and for inferior officers as Captains, Majors, and Colonels, \u2014 John Rosogan, James Rosogan, Will. Winslade of Tregarrick or St. Agnes at M ithian, John Payne of St. Ives, Robert Bochym of Bochym, and his brother, Thomas Underhill, John Salmon, William Segar; together with several priests, rectors, vicars, and curates of churches, as John Thompson, Roger Barret, John Woolcock, WUliam Asa, James Mourton, John Barrow, Richard Bennet, and others, who mustered their soldiers according to the rules of military discipline at Bodmin, where the general ren dezvous was appointed. But no sooner was the General Arundell departed from St. Michael's Mount to exert his power in the camp and field aforesaid, but diverse gentle men, with their wives and families, in his absence possessed themselves thereof; whereupon he dispatched a party of"], [663, "st. Michael's mount. 193 horse and soot to reduce his old garrison ; which quickly they effected, by reason the besieged wanted provision and ammunition, and were distracted with the women and chil dren's fears and cries, and so they yielded the possession to their enemies on condition of free liberty of departing forth with from thence with life, though not without being plundered. The retaking of St. Michael's Mount by the general Arundell proved much to the content and satisfaction of his army at Bodmin, consisting of about six thousand men, which they looked upon as a good omen of their future success, and the first-fruits of the valour and conduct of their general. Whereupon the confederates daily in- creased his army with great numbers of men from all parts, who listed themselves under his banner, which was not only pourtrayed, but by a cart brought into the field for their encouragement, viz. the pyx under its canopy, that is to say, the vessel containing the Roman host, or sacra- mental sacrifice, or body of Christ, together with crosses, banners, candlesticks, holy bread and water, to defend them from devils and the adverse power; (see Fox's Mar- tyrology, p. 669,) which was carried wheresoever the camp removed ; which camp grew so tremendously for- midable at Bodmin, that Job Militon, Esq. then Sheriff of Cornwall, with all the power of his bailiwick, durst not encounter with it during the time of the general's stay in that place, which gave him and his rebels opportunity to consult together for the good of their public interest, and to make out a declaration, or manifesto, of the justice of their cause, and grounds of taking up arms ; but the army, in general, consisting of a mixed multitude of men of diverse professions, trades, and employments, could not easily afrce upon the subject matter and form thereof. Some would have no justice ofthe peace, for that generally they were ignorant of the laws, and could not construe or Eng lish a Latin bill of indictment without the clerk of the peace's assistance, who imposed upon them, with other vol. n. o"], [664, "194 ST. HILARY. attornies, for gain, wrong sense, and judgment; besides, in themselves, they were corrupt and partial in determining cases ; others would have no lawyers nor attornies, for that the one cheated the people in wrong advice or counsel, and the other of their money by extravagant bills of costs ; others would have no court leets, or court barons, for that the cost and expense in prosecuting an action at law therein was many times greater than the debt or profit. But generally it was agreed upon amongst them, that no inclosure should be left standing, but that all lands sjt should be held in common ; yet what expedients should b found out and placed in the room of those several order and degrees of men and officers, none could prescribe. However, the priests, rectors, vicars, and curates, the priors, monks, friars, and other dissolved collegiates, ham mered out seven articles of address for the King's majesty ; upon grant of which they declared their bodies, arms, and goods should all be at his disposal, viz. 1. That curates should administer baptism at all times of need, as well week days as holy days. 2. That their children might be confirmed by the Bishop. 3. That mass might be celebrated, no man communi cating with the priest. 4. That they might have reservation of the Lord's body in churches. 5. That they might have holy bread and water in re membrance of Christ's body and blood. 6. That priests might not be married. 7. That the six articles set forth by King Henry VIII. might be continued at least till the King came of age. Now those six articles were invented by Stephen Gar diner, Bishop of Winchester (who was the bastard son of Lionel Woodvill, Bishop of Salisbury, by his concubine, Elizabeth Gardiner; the which Lionel was fifth son of Richard Woodvill, Earl Rivers, 1470), and therefore called his creed, viz."], [665, "st. Michael's mount. 195 1 . That the body of Christ is really present in the sacra ment after consecration. 2. That the sacrament cannot truly be administered un der both kinds. 3. That priests entered into holy orders might not marry. 4. That vows of chastity entered into upon mature deli beration, were to be kept. 5. That private masses were not to be omitted. 6. That auricular confession was necessary in the church of God. To those demands of die Cornish rebels the King so far condescended as to send an answer in writing to every article, and also a general pardon to every one of them if they would lay down arms. (See Fox's Acts and Monu ments, Book ix. j). 668.) But, alas ! those overtures of the King were not only rejected by the rebels, but made them the more bold and desperate ; especially finding themselves unable longer to subsist upon their own estates and money, or the bounty ofthe country, which hitherto they had done. The general therefore resolved, as the fox who seldom chucks at home, to prey upon other men's goods and estates further off, for his army's better subsistence. Whereupon he dislodged from Bodmin, and marched with his soldiers into Devon, where Sir Peter Carew, Knight, was ready to obstruct their passage with his posse comitatus. But when they saw the order and discipline of the rebels, and that their army consisted of above six thousand fighting men, desperate, well-armed, and prepared for battle, the Sheriff and his troops permitted them quietly to pass through the heart of that country to Exeter ; where the citizens, upon notice of their approaches (as formerly done), shut the gates, and put themselves in a posture of defence. At which time Dr. John Voysey was Bishop of Exeter, viz. 10th July, 1549, John Blacaler was Mayor, William Tothill was Sheriff, Lewis Pol lard, Recorder, William Beaumont, Sword-bearer; John Drake, Geffery Arundell, Henry Maunder, and John o2"], [666, "196 ST.

Things being in this posture, the general Arundell sum moned the citizens to deliver their town and castle to his dominion ; but they sent him a flat denial. Whereupon, forthwith he ordered his men to fire the gates of the city, which accordingly they did; but the citizens on the inside supplied those fires with such quantities of combustible matter, so long till they had cast up a half-moon on the inside thereof, upon which, when the rebels attempted to enter, they were shot to death or cut in pieces. Their entrance being thus obstructed at the gates, they put in practice other expedients, viz. either to undermine the walls or blow them up with barrels of gunpowder, which they had placed in the same ; but the citizens also pre vented this their design, by countermining their mines and casting so much water on the places where their powder barrels were lodged, that the powder would not take fire. Thus stratagems of war were daily practised between the besieged and besiegers, to the great hurt and damage of each other. King Edward being informed by his council of this siege, and that there was little or no dependance upon the valour and conduct of the Sheriff of Devon, and his bailiwick, to suppress this rebellion or raise the siege of Exeter, granted his commission to John Lord Russell, created Baron Russell of Tavistock by King Henry, and Lord High Admiral and Lord Privy Seal, an old experienced soldier who had lost an eye at the siege of Montrueil in Fiance, to be his general for raising soldiers to fight those"], [667, "st. Michael's mount. 197 rebels ; who forthwith, pursuant thereto, raised a consider- able army and marched with them to Honiton ; but when he came there he was informed that the enemy consisted of ten thousand able fighting men armed ; which occasioned his halting there longer than he intended, expecting greater supplies of men, that were coming to his aid under con- duct of the Lord Grey ; which at length arrived and joined his forces, whereupon he dislodged from thence and marched towards Exeter ; where on the way he had several sharp conflicts with the rebels with various success, sometimes the better and sometimes the worse; though at length, after much fatigue of war, maugre all opposition and resistance of the rebels, he forced them to raise their siege, and en- tered the city of Exeter with relief, 6th August, 1549, after thirty-two days' siege; wherein the inhabitants had valiantly defended themselves, though in that extremity they were necessitated by famine to eat horses, moulded cloth, and bread made of bran ; in reward of whose loyalty King Edward gave to the city for ever the manor of Evyland, since sold by the city for making the river Exe navigable. After raising the siege as aforesaid, the general Arundell rallied his routed forces of rebels, and gave battle to the Lord Russell and the King's army, with that inveterate courage, animosity, and resolution, that the greatest part of his men were slain upon the spot, others threw down their arms on mercy, the remainder fled, and were after- wards many of them taken and executed. Sir Anthony Kingston, Knight, a Gloucestershire man, after this rebel- lion was made Provost Marshal for executing such western rebels as could be taken, or were made prisoners in Corn- wall and Devon, together with all such who had been aiders or assisters of them in that rebellion ; upon whom, according to his power and office, he executed martial law with sport and justice (as Mr. Carew and other historians tell us) ; and the principal persons that have come to my knowledge, over whose misery he triumphed, was Boyer"], [668, "198 ST. HILARY. the Mayor of Bodmin ; Mayow of Clevyan, in St. Co lomb Major, whom he hanged at the tavern sign-post in that town, of whom tradition saith his crime was not capital ; and therefore his wife was advised by her friends to hasten to the town after the Marshal and his men, who had him in custody, and beg his life. Which accordingly she prepared to do, and to render herself the more amiable petitioner before the Marshal's eyes, this dame spent so much time in attiring herself and putting on her French hood then in fashion, that her husband was put to death before her arrival. In like manner the Marshal hanged one John Payne, the Mayor, or Portreeve of St. Ives, on a gallows erected in the middle of that town, whose arms are still to be seen in one of the fore-seats in that church, viz. in a plain field three pine apples. Besides those he executed many more in other places in Cornwall, that had been actors, assisters, or promoters of this rebellion. Lastly, it is further memorable of this Sir Anthony King ston, that in Sir John Heywood's Chronicle he is taxed of extreme cruelty in doing his Marshal's office aforesaid. Of whom Fuller, in Gloucestershire, gives us this further account of him : that afterwards, in the reign of Queen Mary, being detected, with several others, of a design to rob her exchequer, though he made his escape and fled into his own country, yet there he was apprehended and taken into custody by a messenger, who was bringing him up to London in order to have justice done upon him for his crime, but he being conscious of his guilt, and de- spairing of pardon, so effectually poisoned himself that he died on the way, without having the due reward of his desert. After the death of Humphrey Arundell, Governor of St. Michael's Mount, executed for treason as aforesaid, King Edward VI. sold or gave the government and revenues thereof to Job Militon, Esq. aforesaid, then Sheriff of Corn wall, during his life ; but his son dying without issue male, the government, by what title I know not, devolved upon"], [669, "st.

In the month of July, 1676, at St. Michael's Mount, about four of the clock in the afternoon, came from the British ocean, or sea, a ball of fire, seen by the inhabitants and fishermen at sea, which struck against the south moor stone wall of this Mount's church or chapel ; where, meet ing resistance from the wall, it glanced through the stones thereof with some rebounds, making a path, or strake, through the same, in some places about four inches broad and two inches deep, from one end of the long side wall almost to the other ; and from thence, by another rebound, it struck the strong oak durns of the dwelling-house entry, and broke the same in two or three pieces, and so flew into the hall, where it fell to the ground, having spent its force and strength as aforesaid, and then brake asunder in pieces, by the side of Mrs. Catherine St. Aubyn, with out doing her any manner of hurt, leaving a sulphurous smoke behind it in the room ; which ball of fire then appeared to consist of a black-blue metally matter, con gealed or melted by fire like as coal and cinders may be, as Sir John St. Aubyn, the elder, and other spectators told me. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing in addition to Mr. Hals, except an uninteresting dissertation to prove that St. Michael's Mount is not the Ocrinum of Ptolemy. WHITAKER. Mr. Whitaker has given several notes and comments on the narrative of Mr. Flals, which will here be placed, together with references to the passages to which they relate. P. 170. (a) The name is Mara-zion, or zien, on the sea, I"], [670, "200 jjjW) ST. HILARY. believe, and Market-Jew is merely a similar appellation in English. A Jew, in Cornish language, is Ethow, and Edheuon, Ethchan, are Jews. P. 170. (b) This corrects Mr. Willis, in ii. 3, who there says ofthe Market-Jew, and other towns expressly, \" none of them ever sent Members to Parliament, or were ever summoned so to do.\" Yet it coincides exactly with what Dr. Brady remarks in his very valuable treatise on Bo roughs, p. 57, 59, and adds one more to his few returns, and instances of very many more which might have been produced \" if needful,\" p. 59. P. 172. (c) Sel, sil, or sul is merely a view, or prospect, from the Welsh sylly, to look or behold, and the Armorick sell, a look or sight; and din-sil, or din-sul, means only the hill of prospect. (e?) The real name of St. Michael's Mount in Cornish is this, Carreg luz en kuz, a hoary rock in a wood. Bor lase's Scilly Isles, p. 94. P. 178. (e) This notice, unobserved by the noticer himself, lets us into a part of the history of this Mount, which has never been unfolded yet. There was plainly a nunnery here, as well as a monastery. Accordingly we find before what this circumstance alone explains, that there were two chapels upon the Mount. One is described before as \" a little chapel yet standing, and dedicated to the Archangel St. Michael, part whereof is now converted to a dwelling house.\" The other is thus, as \" that which renders this place most fa mous, the present church or chapel, yet extant, and kept in good repair with pews ; upon the tower of this church or chapel, for it is bigger than many other Cornish parish churches, is that celebrated place called Kader- Migell, i. e. Michael's chair.\" So distinct are these chapels ! The monastery I apprehend to have been, \" where, towards the north-west, is a kind of level plain about four or six landyards,\" with \" a downright precipice of rocks towards the sea, at least twenty fathoms high.\" And where, about the greater chapel, are \" cells cut in the V"], [671, "ST. MICHAELS MOUNT. 201 rocks for hermitical monks of the aforesaid order.\" And the nunnery I suppose to have been where, \"from this little square, or plain, there is an artificial kind of ascent going towards the east, which offers you a full sight of the outer walls of the castle, and brings you to Porth Home (Hourn), part of which is yet to be seen.\" Thus do we get a glimpse of a nunnery that is invisible from every other point. Tanner, that witness for all other authors upon monastic notices, gives us no intimation from any of them concerning this nunnery. Yet Leland con firms what I have observed in Mr. Hals before, the exist ence of two churches, or chapels, upon the summit of the Mount. \" The way to the church,\" he says, concerning the ascent to the top, \" entereth at the north side from half ebb to half flood, to the foot ofthe Mount, and so ascend eth by steps and grices westward, and thence returneth eastward to the utterward of the church,\" or Mount. Within the said ward is a court strongly walled, \" wherein on the south side is the Chapel of St. Michael, and in the east side a chapel of our Lady. The Captain and priest's lodgings be in the south side of St. Michael's Chapel.\" (Itin. VII. 118.) When this Captain was fixed there with a garrison, as we shall soon see when he was, the nuns were obliged to relinquish their cells to him and them. For this reason we have not a hint in all the ages after wards of a nunnery here. Only the chapel was continued for the use of the garrison, while the church itself was still left to the monks. Such an union as this, of a monastery and a nunnery upon the summit of a pyramidal hill, and amid the sequestrations of solitude, carries a strange ap pearance with it to our Protestant suspiciousness ; yet it was not very uncommon in the reign of popery. It seems to have been peculiarly calculated for that purpose for which both monastery and nunnery were generally calcu lated, to shew the triumph of faith over the impulses of sense, and to shew that triumph more conspicuously, by \u2666he association of monks and nuns in monastic vicinity"], [672, "202 ST. HILARY. to each other. \" This little fortress,\" as Mr. Hals has told us before, \" comprehendeth sufficient rooms and lodgings for the Captain, or Governor, and his soldiers to reside in,\" which I have supposed above \" to have been the original habitations of the nuns and their Abbess ; to which adjoining are several other houses, or cells, hereto fore pertaining to the monks that dwell here, all admirable for their strength, buildings, and contrivance,\" and all probably therefore contemporary or nearly so. P. 180. (/) This account of St. Michael's Mount is in a strain of intelligence and judiciousness much superior to the general tenor of Mr. Hals's writings. To it I wish to add some useful notices, in accompaniment of some that I have given before. Upon the very crown and summit of this pyramidal hill, stands proudly eminent the church, stretching from east to west, and having a tower in the middle. It was built by Edward the Confessor, who was the first to consecrate the Mount to religion, and erected the church on the little plain at the top of it. Having done this, and erected habitations for the clergy attending it, he gave them, by charter still existing in recital, the whole of the Mount, and many lands beside. \" Ego Edwardus, Dei gracia Anglorum Rex, dare volans pretium redemptionis anim\u00e6 me\u00e6 vel parentum meorum, sub consensu et testimonio bonorum virorum, tradidi Sancto Michaeli Archangelo, in usum fratrum Deo servientium in eodem loco, Sanctum Michaelem,\" the church, \"qui est juxta mare.\" He also gives them \" totam terram de Venefire ; \" and proceeds \" portum addere qui vocatur Ruminella.'' Romney, in Kent. Then came Ro bert Earl of M ortaigne, the falsely reputed founder, merely to associate this church with another of the same appella tion in Normandy, and to enlarge its endowments. In a new charter, equally as the old without a date, he, \" habens in bello Sancti Michaelis vexillum,\" says, \" do et concedo Montem Sancti Michaelis de Cornubia Deo et monachis ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Michaelis de Periculo"], [673, "st. Michael's mount. 203 Maris servientibus, cum dimidia terr\u00e6 hida.\" But, as he adds, \" postea autem ut certissime eomperi, Beati Mi chaelis meritis monachorumque suffragiis michi a Deo ex propria conjuge mea filio concesso, auxi donum ipsi beato militi\u00e6 celestis principi, dedi et dono in Amaneth (Quere, where?) tres acras terr\u00e6, Travalaboth videlicet, Lis manoch, Trequaners, Carmailoc,\" &c. 2. And, finally, comes the Bishop of Exeter, in a charter dated expressly 1085, to free \" ecclesiam Beati Michaelis Archan^eli de Cornubia,\" from all episcopal jurisdiction. 3. Thus erected and thus privileged, the church remained till the day of William of Worcester, and he thus notes the dimensions of it: \" Memorandum, longitudo ecclesi\u00e6 Montis Sancti Michaelis continet 30 steppys, latitudo continet 12 steppys.\" 4. Carew also speaks of it as \" a chapel for devotion, builded by William Earl of Morion,\" (Carew so speaking with the multitude, when he ought to have given the building to the Confessor,) \"and greatly haunted while folk endured (endeared) their merits by farre tra vailing.\" 5. Carew thus refers obscurely, perhaps uncon sciously, to a particular privilege annexed to the church, which was given by one decree from Pope Gregory, and confirmed by another from Bishop Leofric. \" Universis Sanct\u00e6 Matris ecclesi\u00e6 presentes literas inspecturis vel auditmis salutem,\" cries the former, \" noverit universitas vestra quod sanctissimus Papa Giegorius, anno ab incar natione Domini millesimo septuagesimo,\" the very year, therefore, in which Earl Montaign gave this church to the other in Normandy, \" ad ecclesiam Montis Sancti Mi chaelis, in comitatu Cornubi\u00e6, gerens eximi\u00e6 devocionis siffectum, pie concessit ecclesi\u00e6 predict\u00e6, [et] omnibus fi delibus, qui illam cum suis beneficiis et elemosinis,\" (with alms and oblations, so that \" folke endeared their merits,\" not merely \" by farre travailing,\" but by a tax upon their purse,) \" exepecierint seu visitaverint, tertiam partem pene- tenciarum suarum eis condonari,\" a third of all those acts"], [674, "204 ST. HILARY. being remitted, which penitents were enjoined to perform, in order to prove the sincerity of their penitence to God, and to themselves. The same privilege is repeated by the Bishop of Exeter in 1085, thus : \" omnibus illis, qui ilium ecclesiam suis cum beneficiis et elemosinis expetierint et visitaverint, tertiam partem penitentiarum condonamus.\" Yet, what is surprising, the privilege became nearly as much unknown afterwards as it is at present, and was therefore promulgated by the clergy of the church at the beginning of the fifteenth century : \" Tota verba,\" adds the reciter, \" in antiquis registris de novo,\" a little before William's visit, \" in hae ecclesia repertis, inventa,\" being then unknown to the very clergy themselves, and only dis covered by the discovery of some registers equally unknown, \" prout hie in valvis ecclesi\u00e6 publice ponuntur,'' were exhibited to public view by being posted upon the folding doors of the church. \" Et quia pluribus istud est incog nitum, ideo nos, in Christo Dei famuli et ministri hujus ec clesi\u00e6, universitatem vestram qui regimen animarum possi detis,\" all the rectors and vicars of the kingdom, \" ob mutu\u00e6 vicissitudinis obtentum requirimus et rogamus, qua tenus ista publicetis in ecclesiis vestris, ut vestri subditi et subjecti ad majorem exoracionem devocionis attentius ani mentur, et locum istum gloriosius peregrinando frequentent ad dona et indulgencias predicta graciose consequenda.\" From this republication of the privilege, undoubtedly, did the numerous resort of pilgrims to the church begin. Then too was formed assuredly that seat on the tower, which is so ridiculously described by Carew, as \" a little without the castle \u2014 a bad seat in a craggy place \u2014 somewhat dangerous for access ; \" when it is only a chair, composed of stones, projecting from the two sides of the tower battlements, and uniting into a seat without the south-western angle, but elevated above the battlements on each side. It thus ap pears somewhat dangerous from the elevation or projection only, is an evident addition to the tower, and was assuredly"], [675, "st. Michael's mount. 205 made at this period for the pilgrims, that they might com plete their devotions at the Mount by sitting in this St. Michael's Chair, as denominated, and by showing them selves as pilgrims to the country round. Hence, in an author * who alludes to customs without feeling the force of his allusion, we read this intimation : Who knowes not Michael's Mount and Chaire, The pilgrim's holy vaunt ? We thus find a reason for the construction of such a chair, that comports with all the purposes of the church on the tower of which it is constructed, and that shows it minis tered equally with this to the uses of religion then predo minant ; making it not, as Carew most extravagantly makes it, \" somewhat dangerous for access, and therefore holy for the adventure,\" but holy in itself, as on the church-tower, holy in its purposes, as the seat of the pilgrims, and doubly holy as the seat of accomplishment to all their vows, as the seat of invitation to all the country. And the whole church remains to this day, beaten by the rains and buffeted by the winds, yet a venerable monument of Saxon archi tecture. This Mount appears decisively, from the charter of the Confessor, to have been in his time not surrounded with the sea during all the flood tide, and not accessible by land only during some hours of the ebb-tide, as it is at present. It was then not surrounded at all. It was only near the sea then. Thus the Confessor describes it expressly, as \" Sanctum Michaelem qui est juxta mare.\" But as Wor- cestre adds, with a range back into the past that is very striking, yet is in general confirmed by the charter above, \" the space of ground upon Mount St. Michael is two hundred cubits, surrounded with the ocean,\" at flood tide ; \" the place aforesaid was originally inclosed with a very thick wood, distant from the ocean six miles, affording the finest shelter for wild beasts.\" * William of Worcester o 7 VOL. 11."], [676, "206 ST. HILARY. THE EDITOR. Nothing is known with any certainty respecting the ancient state of St. Michael's Mount. It may have been the seat of a Celtic superstition some what similar to that imagined and described by Dr. William Borlase. Sir Christopher Hawkins has adduced many arguments for proving this semi-island to have been the Ictis of Diodorus Siculus; and its situation, united to its sea-port, may well have recommended such a place for a factory to the merchants of any civilized nation engaged in commercial transactions with people so rude as were the Britons of those remote times. The universal practice in our days, is to establish fortified stations under similar cir cumstances, since neither person or property can be effec tually protected in any other way. The earliest definite tradition of a Christian establish ment dates with the pilgrimage of St. Kenna, in conse quence of the appearance of the Arch-angel at that place. No particular circumstances are ever related of this extra ordinary vision, neither as to the occasion nor as to the per sons so eminently favoured as to behold the celestial glory, nor as to the time, nor of the exact spot, since it could not have taken place on the top of the tower, that building having been constructed in honour of the vision itself. It may be remarked that lofty and elevated situations throughout Europe are dedicated to St. Michael, probably on account ofthe Archangel being uniformly painted with wings, and therefore tacitly imagined to have habits similar to birds ; and perhaps the dedication of the largest of our domestic fowls to the celebration of his festival, may owe its origin to a similar analogy. Saint Kenna is believed to have imparted the same iden tical virtue to the chair which overhangs the tower, as she"], [677, "st. Michael's mount. 207 bestowed on the celebrated well near Liskeard, and since no one obtains a seat in this chair without much resolution and steadiness of head, one may be inclined to anticipate the supposed effect with greater certainty from the achieve ment of sitting in St. Michael's chair, than from drinking water from St. Kenna's well. The time of St. Kenna's visitation is not accurately known. She is supposed to be the same St. Keyna, daughter of a prince of Brecknock shire, who lived a recluse life for many years near a town situated midway between Bristol and Bath, since called Cainsbarn, after her name, where she founded a monas tery in the beginning of the sixth century, and cleaned the neighbourhood from snakes and vipers by converting them all into Cornua Ammonis, which have abounded there ever since, in testimony of her sanctity and of the fervour of her prayers. The supposed ancient site of St. Michael's Mount, its being the hoarv monk in a wood surrounded by forests, is deduced from arguments very similar to those which prove the miraculous power of St. Kenna in converting serpents into stones. Trees have been found buried under the sand and silt in the Mount's Bay, as they are frequently found in every similar inlet of the sea on the southern coast of England. And the tradition, if a term so respectable may be applied to such vague conjectures, applies equally to Mount St. Michael ; or they may have been derived from a common origin.

William Lambert, Oct. 1, 1410. As the alien priories were suppressed by Henry V. who began his reign in 1413, William Lambert was probably the last Prior. Bishop Tanner says, in his Notitia Monastica : \u2014 After the suppression of the alien priories, this was first given by King Henry VI. to King's College, Cambridge, and after- wards by King Edward IV. to the nunnery of Sion, in Middlesex. At the first seizure by King Edward III. the farm was rated but at 10/. per annum, but at the general dissolution by Henry VIII. the lands belonging to tliis house, as parcel of Sion Abbey, were valued at 110/. 12s. per annum. The charter'of Saint Edward may be thus translated : \" In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity. I Edward, by the grace of God King of the English, willing to give the price of the redemption of my own soul, or of the souls of my parents, with the consent and attestation of good men, have delivered to St. Michael the Archangel, for the use of the brethren serving God in that place, Saint Michael, which is near the sea, with all its appendages, that is to say, with its towns, castles, lands, and other ap purtenances.

And he also grants a release from a third part of their penances to all such persons as may visit this church of St. Michael with oblations and alms. The Mount appears never to have received a reli gious society after its suppression as an alien priory in the reign of King Henry the Fifth. At the period of the ge neral dissolution it must have been let at an anuual rent, for in the abstract roll preserved in the Augmentation Office this entry occurs under Syon Abbey : \" Cornub. \u2014 S. Michael, ad Montem, Firma 26/. 13s. Ad.\" The history of St. Michael's Mount since its dissolution, as a parcel of Sion Abbey, is very far from being clear. It appears to have been granted at first for terms of years to different gentlemen of the neighbourhood. To Mil lington, supposed of Pengersick, in Breage ; to Harris, of Kenegie, in Gulval; and perhaps jointly with Milling ton to a Billett or Bennett. A person of that name, half deranged, who died about the middle of the last century, continued during the whole of his. life to shoot rabbits on the Mount one day in the year by way of maintaining a supposed right, which, being utterly groundless, was humanely allowed to pass unobserved."], [683, "st. Michael's mount. 213 Queen Elizabeth, or King James I. appears to have granted the whole in fee to Robert Cecil, created Earl of Salisbury May 4, 1605. But the Mount was seised into his own hands by King Charles I. just at the breaking out of the civil war, probably on account of the great military importance of this hold, when William Cecil, son of the former, having subscribed the Declaration made at York, on the 13th of June, 1642, left the party of which the King was at the head, and joined the opposite party in London. An order was soon after given to Sir Francis Basset, then Sheriff of Cornwall, to place the Mount in a state of defence, and to supply it with ammunition and provisions ; and it is not improbable that a grant was made of the castle and Mount to Sir Francis Basset al once, in witness of his zeal displayed in the cause, and as some indemnity for the expenses he had incurred, the royalist party never having had any considerable sum of money at\" their com mand. The Bassets having suffered extremely in their property by efforts made during the war, and by compositions after wards, it was found convenient to sell St. Michael's Mount about the year 1660 ; when it was most fortunately pur chased by Sir John St. Aubyn, in whose opulent family, and through five John St. Aubyns, it has descended to the present possessor of that name. Every individual of this family has proved himself de sirous of supporting, of maintaining, and of beautifying one of the most extrordinary spots in the whole world. Including Dartmoor and the Scilly Islands, granite breaks out into six large but unequal masses, which, like the Appeninnes of Italy, extend a narrow promontory into the sea. St. Michael's Mount presents a ridge of granite equally distinct with any of these great masses, and rises into a lofty cone, the base being surrounded by the killas, a peculiar schist, the chief metalliferous rock of Cornwall."], [684, "214 ST. HILARY. And here most of the curious phenomena are found which occur at the junction of these two rocks. The buildings on the summit are grand and appropriate to the scenery, and venerable from their antiquity. The church, with its tower, completing the pyramidal figure of the whole, are supposed to date so far back as the reign of St. Edward. And a modern addition of two rooms on the eastern part of the building, made by the late Sir John Aubyn about the year 1750, is in complete har mony with the other parts, and adds to the general effect. The inside of the castle, or priory, has been much de corated within a few years, and florid gothic ornaments have been added to the exterior ; but opinions are much divided as to the accordance of these new parts with build ings to which Sir Walter Scott's line may be applied, In Saxon strength the Abbey frown'd. At the foot of the Mount a small pier existed from a time probably anterior to the Monastery itself, but in the early part of the last century a lease on lives was granted to Mr. George Blewett, the early associate and in some de gree rival of the great Mr. Lemon. This gentleman rebuilt the pier on a very enlarged scale, and concentrated here almost the whole commerce of Penwith hundred, which has since his time gone to Penzance and Hayle. St. Michael's Mount is said to be selected as the scene of many strange adventures, in Italian romances ; while Cornwall is supposed to abound with enchanters, goblins, and other supernatural beings. An English romance, once popular with the old and with the young, but now banished even from our nurseries, be gins thus : \" In the days of King Arthur the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a monstrous giant.\" ma Tasca Argo i Mini, e tascia Artu qui' suoi Erronti, che di sogni empion le carte. Marazion has certainly to boast of very great antiquity."], [685, "215 MARAZION. It may have existed in the earliest times, if the Mount really afforded protection to the Eastern merchants, who sought the shores of Cornwall for its tin. And the names Marazion and Marketjew cannot but ex- cite an inclination to believe that in the Middle Ages this place may have been the resort of the most extraordinary people, who at all times have manifested a peculiar incli- nation for dealing in metals ; it is moreover worthy of re mark that all remains of places where tin has heretofore been smelted in the most simple manner, are invariably denominated Jew's Houses. Marazion must also have af forded shelter and entertainment to the crowds of pilgrims assembling at particular periods to adore the Shrine of St. Michael, and to participate in the indulgence granted by Liuricus Bishop of Exeter, on the exhortation of his Lord the Pope. Marazion received a charter of incorporation from Queen Elizabeth, but the town, although beautifully situated, has not kept pace in the career of improvement with many others, and especially not with Penzance. About the middle of the last century, which was the great epoch for the establishment of turnpike roads, as the besinnins of this century will be considered for their im- provement on principles of science and of general accom- modation, a turnpike road was laid out from Falmouth, through Penryn and Helston, to the western of Marazion, by which a new entrance was opened from Penzance ; and about the year 1775 a large castellated house was built at the western extremity of the town, by Mr. John Blewett, son of Mr. George Blewett, the very considerable mer- chant noticed above, in imitation of the house at Tregenna, near St. Ive's, built by Mr. Samuel Stephens a few years before, under the direction of Mr. Wood, an architect from Bath, who had constructed most of the splendid works in that city. Mr. George Blewett, rising from the lowest origin, is said to have accumulated a hundred thousand pounds. On"], [686, "216 ST. HILARY. the death of his only son the property went to a nephew, and the whole has been dissipated. The house was some time afterwards purchased by an other Mr. Blewett, wholly unconnected with the former, who acquired a considerable fortune in the war : that has also entirely disappeared, and the house has passed into other hands. Mr. Pascoe Grenfell, Commissary to the States of Hol land, resided here during a long life, although he was ori ginally of Penzance : and here was born his son Mr. Pascoe Grenfell, junior, well known throughout England as an active Member of Parliament, as a man of talent and of great liberality, commensurate to his almost unexampled success in commerce. From Marazion also have sprung the family of Cole. Captain Francis Cole would have risen to the most ele vated station in the Navy if he had not been cut off by an early death. Captain Christopher Cole most justly acquired the highest military reputation by his capture of Banda in the East Indies, with a force several times less numerous than the garrison which he overcame; and, having taken the place with such an union of courage, determined resolu tion, aud of prudence, as would rival the exploits of chivalry, he acquired still greater glory by extending a truly heroic courtesy to the vanquished, protecting them in their per sons, in their properties, and in the exercise of their reli gious and of their civil rights. Having settled, in conse quence of his marriage, in Glamorganshire, he has had the honour of representing that county in Parliament. The Reverend John Cole, D.D. attained the high situa tion of Rector of Exeter College, Oxford. And the younger brother, Dr. Samuel Cole, is now Chaplain-general to the Navy. The principal inhabitant at present is Mr. William Cor nish, a very respectable merchant and a magistrate for the"], [687, "ST. HILARY. 217 county ; he married a daughter of the elder Captain Cole, and has a numerous family. Treveneage seems to have been the principal seat in this parish. A branch of the Godolphins resided here, having acquired the property by a marriage with the heiress of an ancient family denominated Goverigon or Gavrigan, whose principal residence was in St. Colomb. Katherine Godolphin, daughter and heiress of Francis Godolphin, Esq. of Treveneage, married John St. Aubyn, of Clowance, Esq. and was buried at St. Hilary, on the 13th of March 1662, as appears from an inscription on a monument to her memory in the church. The barton of Treveneage was however sold, and after passing through Robinson, it was purchased, about the year 1665, by the family of Tredenham, of Tredenham, or Tre dinham, in Probus. Mr. Joseph Tredinham was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1665, and was knighted. One of his daughters, and eventually his coheiress, married Scobell of Menigwins, in St. Austell ; and from a coheiress of Scobell this barton, together with an extensive manor, descended to the Hawkins's of Pen nance, and from them to the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, of Trewithan in Probus, and of Trewinnard in St. Erth. Tregembo, or Tregember, bears an appearance of con siderable antiquity. Mr. Lysons says that it belonged to the family of Grosse, and that it passed by sales, through Kine to Penneck, in the vear 1684. o t . The Pennecks were originally of Trescow in Breage, and advanced themselves in the world by the stewardship and patronage of the Godolphins. One of this family, the Reverend John Penneck, who died in 1724, was Chan cellor of Exeter, and would probably have been advanced much higher in the church if the Marlborough and Go dolphin administration had remained longer in the posses sion of power. On this gentleman's decease, without children, his pro-"], [688, "218 ST. HILARY. perty devolved on the Reverend John Penneck, vicar of Gulval, who married Wroughton, and left two sons and two daughters ; John, who succeeded him in the living of Gulval, and Charles, bred to the law, but who quitted that profession for the militia during the American War. Mr. John Penneck died in 1789, and his brother in 1801 ; they were succeeded by their two sisters, who were, Catherine, married to the Reverend William Borlase, son and eventually sole heir of the Reverend Walter Bor lase, LL.D. of Castlehorneck ; and Ann, married to John Bingham Borlase, M.D. who had the honour of bestowing his early medical education on Sir Humphrey Davy. Each of these sisters left an only daughter. Ann, daughter of the eldest, married to the Reverend Mr. Peters; and Ann, daughter of the second, married to Captain Pascoe. The manor of Tregurtha also belonged to the Pennecks, having been purchased in the early part ofthe last century; but this manor, together with a large portion of their other possessions, were sold by the two last brothers. This manor was bought jointly by Mr. Carne, of Penzance, and the late Mr. Thomas Grylls, of Helston. Tregembo still belongs to the two ladies. Ennis, usually called Ninnis, was for some time a gen tleman's seat, although it is now become a mere farm. Mr. Humphrey Millett, the last resident gentleman, had been a member of Exeter College. He married Mary, dau^h ter of Mr. Sandys, of Helston, and dying early in life left two daughters his coheiresses. The eldest daughter, Mary, married Thomas Grylls, Esq. and the second daughter, Grace, married Charles Short, Esq. of Devonshire, Clerk of the Rules in the Court of King's Bench, and both have families. The widow married secondly George Trework Esq. of Penzance. Trevarthen has the appearance of a place respectable in former times. The freehold belongs to the Duke of Leeds, as heir of the Godolphins ; but it was held for a long"], [689, "219 ST. HILARY. period of years on a lease for lives by one of the numerous branches of the family of Davies, now all extinct. This parish has abounded in mines, especially in the manors of Treveneage and Tregurtha; but the most re markable in its consequences was a mine called Whele Fortune, on Trowall or Truthwell, belonging to Lord Go dolphin, as it enabled Mr. Lemon to move on the great scale which afterwards so eminently distinguished him ; as it laid the foundation of Mr. Blewett's large fortune ; and brought forward Captain Dewen, whose fortune descended on two daughters, one married to the Rev. George Borlase, Fellow of All Souls, and son of the historian ; the other married to Mr. Keir, a gentleman in the profession of medicine. The church is situated on a commanding elevation, and would be an imposing object throughout the whole neigh bourhood, if it were not disfigured by an insignificant spire. The church and churchyard contain several monuments to the Godolphins, Pennecks, Milletts, Blewetts, &c. On a stone, now made the floor of a seat in the south east corner of St. Hilary church, is the following curious inscription to one of the Godolphins. Aquila qu\u00e6 volucres c\u0153li supereminet omnes, Et Caper e summis qui carpit montibus herbam, Quique tuum referens Godolphin nomen in undis Delphinus, piscesque regit, cursuque fatigat ; H\u00e6c bene te natum proavis insignia monstrant Per ccelum, et terras, et vasta per \u00e6quora claris, Et tua te virtus cunctis majoribus \u00e6quat.

Et qu\u00e6 modo florida vigent Per am\u0153nos Lilia campos, Citius quam dicere possis, Aspectu Solis eoi Marcescunt ; sic violentis Fatorum legibus omnes Cedunt, juvenesque senesque,"], [690, "220 ST.

Sic qui modo floruit inter Primos, generosus, et inter \u2022 Claros ; quos vexit honoris Summi ad fastigia virtus ; Nulli pietate secundus, Godolphin morte peremptus, Fatis succumbit iniquis. Humana hinc discite quam Vita incerta et brevis ! Sic transit Gloria Mundi ! In connection with the church, one of those casual coin cidences may be noticed, which continued to be remem bered and cited for more than a century in this parish, and to obtain belief or discredit, as an interposition of Provi dence, according to the religious or the political opinions of those who heard or related it. It seems that a Mr. Palmer held this living previously to the Restoration of King Charles II. and that he was one among the two thousand, who in obedience to the dictates of their consciences, from the fear of disgrace, or from po- litical motives, refused, \" In the church, chapel, or place of public worship belonging to their benefices or promo tions, upon some Lord's Day before the Feast of St. Bar- tholomew, which should be in the year of our Lord God one thousand six hundred and sixty-two, openly, publickly, and solemnly to read the morning and evening prayer, ap pointed to be read by and according to the Book of Com mon Prayer, at the times thereby appointed, and after such reading thereof, and openly and publickly before the con gregation there assembled, to declare their unfeigned as sent to the use of all things in the said book contained and prescribed.\" See the Act of Uniformity, anno decimo tertio et quarto Caroli II. ch. 4. In consequence of this refusal the two thousand incum bents were ejected without any provision or allowance whatever, so that many of them perished from actual want. Several thus ejected without doubt continued the exercise"], [691, "221 ST. HILARY. of their sacred functions among such as were desirous or willing to assist at them ; and for this offence Mr. Palmer was called before magistrates appointed by the new govern ment, who ordered his commitment to prison, when the ejected vicar is said to have addressed Mr Robinson, of Treveneage, one of the magistrates, in the words of Mi caiah, \" If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me.\" Within a short time after this vaticination Mr. Robin son met his death by the goring of his own bull. It would be inexcusable in me if I were to leave this parish without noticing the late Vicar, from whose kindness I received information whenever it was asked, in those sci ences which have afforded me uninterrupted entertainment and delight throughout the whole continuance of a pro tracted life. The Reverend Malachy Hitchins was born in the parish of Gwenap, about the year 1740 ; possessed of hereditary claims to mathematical attainments as the nephew of Mr. Thomas Martyn, well known by his excellent map of Cornwall published about that time; a map then equal ling if not surpassing the best county maps of England, and still almost unrivalled for minute and accurate topo graphy, including the boundaries of parishes \u2014 the work of fifteen years labour. I have not succeeded in acquiring any information re specting Mr. Hitchins in his early years, with the exception of a general report of his being then distinguished by the ability, accuracy, and diligence conspicuous in his future years. These qualities, and probably his near connection with Mr. Martyn, recommended Mr. Hitchins as an assistant to Mr. Benjamin Donne in constructing a map of Devonshire, an occupation decisive of his future life, for at Bideford he became acquainted with Miss Hockin, whom he married, and acquiring with her an acces sion of fortune, he proceeded to Oxford, and became a member of Exeter College, with the view of obtaining"], [692, "222 ST. HILARY. orders. But Mr. Hitchins possessed talents and acquire ments that could not admit of his remaining undistinguished at a place of learning. He was soon noticed by the mathe maticians, and recommended to the Reverend Nevil Mas kelyne, Astronomer Royal, to assist him at the Royal Ob servatory ; and when Doctor Maskelyne went to St. He lena, in the year 1761, to observe the transit of Venus, and to ascertain, if it were possible, the parallax of Sirius, Mr. Hitchins had the whole care of the Observatory entrusted to his hands. Another object of Doctor Maskelyne's voyage, and one eventually of by far the greatest importance, was to prove from actual experience that Longitudes at sea might be derived from observations on the moon. Tables founded on the theory of gravitation and of inertia, as laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, had then been constructed by Tobias Mayer, of Gottingen, and communicated to Dr. Maskelyne in manuscript, representing the moon's place at all times in the heavens, within narrow limits ; and the admirable instrument invented by Mr. John Hadley, by rendering the apparent contact of two objects, independent of all agitations of the instrument itself, enabled observers to ascertain the distance of the moon from the sun, or from a star, almost as accurately on board a ship as on the solid land. With these assistances the determination of a ship's longitude became an easy problem. The moon is con verted into the hand of a clock, indicating by its distance from a particular star, the time at Greenwich Observatory made the first meridian. This distance is ascertained by Hadley 's sextant, and after applying certain corrections for parallax and refraction, the time at Greenwich be comes known. The actual time at the place of observa tion is then determined from the altitude of some celestial body, and thus differences in the longitude required. Doctor Maskelyne having fully verified the complete practicability of this method, procured throguh the Board of Longitude the publication of Mayer's tables, accompa-"], [693, "223 ST. HILARY. nied by a reward or premium, under an Act of Parliament, to his widow, of three thousand pounds ; and soon after wards the same eminent and patriotic astronomer devised and executed a work absolutely necessary for enabling or dinary persons to avail themselves of this important dis covery, namely the Nautical Almanac, in which the sun's place is accurately given for the noon of each day, the place of the moon for noon and midnight of each day, and the true angular distance of the moon from the sun, and from certain stars for every third hour of the day and of the night throughout the year, together with the equation of time, the places of the planets, &c. : thus saving to ob servers perhaps ninety-nine parts out of a hundred of the calculations that were previously indispensible. The labour of such a work must obviously require many hands, especially as without great care in constructing the original calculation, and in correcting the press, it would prove worse than useless. To ensure this accuracy, the most important parts were performed in duplicate by dif ferent persons, and the whole carefully collated and veri fied by the superior officer, called the Comparer, under the ultimate superintendence of the Astronomer Royal himself. In constructing the first Nautical Almanac that ap peared, for 1767, Mr. Hitchins performed the office of a computer ; but for all the others, up to the period of his decease in 1809, he most advantageously, not only for this country but for the whole world, executed the office of comparer. The Lunar tables are now carried to a degree of per fection far exceeding those of Mayer, and the Nautical Almanac has been enlarged and improved ; but the glory of devising the work remains with Doctor Maskelyne, and perhaps scarcely a less degree of glory with Mr. Hitchins, for having conducted it with unrivalled accuracy for a period extending through so great a number of years. Durinn. his residence at Greenwich Mr. Hitchins had received holy orders ; and, as the office of comparer did"], [694, "224 ST. HILARY. not confine him to any particular place, he removed to Exeter, and soon obtained the vicarage of Hennock, to hold for a minor. He did not fail however of attracting attention from the clergy of the Cathedral, and about the year 1774 Bishop Keppell collated him to St. Hilary, which had lapsed in consequence of a dispute between two of the numerous patrons claiming unsettled turns to the pre sentation. Here Mr. Hitchins resided respected and ad mired till the close of his life, on the 28th of March 1809 ; having been distinguished by the succeeding Bishop of Exeter, Dr. John Ross, who conferred on him the adjoin ing vicarage of Gwinear. Mr. Hitchins had four sons and one daughter. The eldest, Richard, was a Fellow of Exeter College, and died unmarried on a college living. The second, Thomas, also a clergyman, married Miss Emma Grenfell, of Marazion ; he served for many years a church near Plymouth, and has left several children. The third, Malachy, inherited his father's genius with his name. He filled the office for some time that his father had occupied in the Royal Observatory ; but ultimately preferring the law, he settled at Marazion, where he died at an early age in December 1802. The fourth son, Fortescue, was also in the law, and settled at St. Ive's. He distinguished himself as a poet and as a writer, having taken a considerable share in compiling a History of Cornwall ; but his life was also restricted to a narrow space. The only daughter, Josepha, married William Millett, Esq. originally of Gurlin in St. Erth, and is now a widow with several sons. Mr. Hitchins had his time too much occupied to allow of his composing any considerable work. He made one communication however to the Royal Society, and another to the Society of Antiquaries ; besides these there are various minor publications, some bearing his name, and others the signature of Vatum Ultimus, alluding to his"], [695, "ST.

THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. This parish is similarly constituted to the adjacent pa rishes of St. Erth and Gwinear, being all situated on a line running north-east and south-west, between the large masses of granite of the Land's End and of Cambrea. St. Michael's Mount, adjoining the shore of this parish, is an object of great attention to the geologist as well as to the tourist. It is composed almost entirely of granite, having only two small patches of slate, one on the western and the other on the eastern side ; at these two places, and more particularly at the latter, the junction of the granite and of the slate may be seen, the slate being intersected with numerous granite veins. The granite of the Mount is not so large-grained as that of the Land's End ; but the structure of the rock is no where better displayed than at VOL. II. Q"], [696, "226 ST. HILARY. this place on the southern side ; where the whole mass is distinctly divided into large quadrangular blocks, and is traversed in a direction parallel to the divisions, by quartz veins, which contain crystals of mica, of apatite, and of topaz, and also the ores of tin, copper, and wolfram, the latter of which is the most abundant. One most important geological fact is here beautifully exhibited. That the mineral composition of granite is altered in the vicinity of quartz veins, whether they are metalliferous or otherwise ; approaching these veins the granite becomes more and more siliceous, until at length it gradually passes into the quartz, which forms the body (or matrix as it is called) of the veins. A fact difficult to reconcile with the generally received opinion, which as sumes all veins to have been originally fissures, subse quently filled up from above or beneath. HILL, NORTH. HALS.

The late possessor, John Vincent, Gent, sometime Fellow of All Souls College in Oxford, originally descended, as I am informed, from the Vincents of Stoke Dabernon in Surrey, and giveth the same arms, viz. Azure, three quatre- foils Argent. His younger brother, Mr. Matthias Vincent, was bound or bred an apprentice with a merchant at London, and having but a small fortune to begin trade with, yet for his care and industry was so taken notice of in London that he was sent by the East India Company as one of their factors to Surat in the Mogul's country, where by his skill in factorage and merchandize, but chiefly by marriage with a Portugal merchant's daughter and heir, he obtained a great quantity of riches, goods, and chattels ; whereupon he left his servile trade of a factor to others, and returned with his family and riches safely into England, temp. James II. by whom he was knighted, and in one of his Parliaments was chosen a burgess for the town of Lest withell, and served in that capacity for some time, till an unlucky accident happened between him and his wife, or lady, who upon some real or feigned grounds grew jealous o 2"], [698, "228 HIL'L, NORTH. of his familiarity with another, privately eloped from him, carrying with her great quantities of his gold and jewels.

THE EDITOR. By far the principal place in this parish is Trebartha, now for three descents the residence of the very respectable family of Rodd. Mrs, Grylls bequeathed her property to Mr. Francis Rodd, of Herefordshire, a Captain in the Guards, not as her relation but as her intended third husband. This gen tleman was succeeded by his son Francis Rodd, for many years Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. He married one of the three coheiresses of Heale and Paynten, and left three sons, Francis Heale Rodd, Esq. the present possessor of Trebartha; the Rev. Edward Rodd, D.D. and Rector of St. Just in Roseland, heretofore Fellow of Exeter College, and Proctor of the University of Oxford in the year 1802 ; and Sir John Tremayne Rodd, an Admiral. Also two daughters, Jane and Harriet, the latter married to Mr. Fursdon, of Devonshire. Trebartha is in many respects worthy of being reckoned among the first places in Cornwall. The scenery, grand in other respects, is rendered still more so by the addition of a mountain torrent; and the house has been greatly im proved by the late proprietor and the present, who has chiefly resided there, highly respected as a magistrate, as a gentleman, and as the benefactor of his neighbourhood. Mr. Rodd was a Fellow of All Souls, and during the war he served, as his father had done before him, in the defence of his country."], [699, "229 HILL, SOUTH. Mr. Lysons says that the Lord of the Manor of Tre- veniel, which was passed from the Carews to the Spours, and from them to Rodd, claims by immemorial custom of the Mayor of Launceston the service of holding his stirrup whenever he shall mount his horse in that town in presence of the Duke of Cornwall ; a claim, however, difficult to prove by any exercise of it, even within legal memory, and now rendered obsolete by disusage if that effect is ever produced. The presentation to the living is in Mr. Rodd. The church is large, consisting of three entire ailes with a lofty tower, and placed on a commanding eminence. The in- terior is adorned with several splendid monuments of the . present and former families resident at Trebartha. The present rector is the Rev. E. Trelawny, instituted in 1828.

THE EDITOR. Mr. Whitaker, in a note, suggests Manach Don, or Ton, the Monk's House, as the derivation for Manaton. Mr. Lysons says that two thirds of the great manor of Calliland or Kalliland, passed from the baronial family of Stafford, by a coheiress, to WiUoughby Lord Brook, and are now vested in Lord Clinton ; the other third was in the Crown, and was granted by King Richard the Third to John Coryton, Esq. of Newton; that it belonged in 1620 to the Glanvilles, and is now vested in Richard Strode, Esq. and that Manaton is become the property of Sir William Call. Lord Clinton is patron of the rectory ; which was called St. Sampson's de Southill, in honour no doubt of St. Sampson already mentioned, a native of Monmouth shire, and afterwards a Bishop in France. The church is large, and placed on an elevated situation, and contains memorials of the Manaton family. The Rev. John Trefusis, instituted in 1802, is the present rector.

TONKIN. I take St. Jacob to be the patron Saint of this parish, and not the patriarch Jacob, as some have imagined. The termination Stowe comes from the Saxon, and means a home or a dwelling. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons mentions some few particulars respecting this parish. He says that Sawacott, or Southcot, is the"], [703, "JACOBSTOW. 233 sole village in the parish ; and that a manor called Penhal lam, having belonged to a Sir John Stowell in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, ha\u00bb passed through various hands, and that it had been finally purchased about the year 1802 by the Rev. Charles Dayman. The barton of Berry Court has its mansion surrounded by a moat, indicative of ancient importance, but nothing seems to be known of its history. In Wood's Athen\u00e6 Oxonienses may be found the fol lowing account of a native of this parish : Degorie Wheare was born at Jacobstow in Cornwall ; retired to the habitation of the Muses called Broadgate Hall (Pembroke College) in the beginning of the year 1592, aged 19; took the degrees in Arts, that of Master being completed in 1600; elected probationer fellow of Exeter College; and six years afterwards leaving that house, travelled into several countries beyond the seas, by which he obtained as well learning as experience. At his return he was entertained by the Lord Chandois, and by him respected and exhibited to. After his death our author with his wife retired to Gloucester Hall, where Doctor Hawley, the Principal, demised to him lodgings ; and there he became so well acquainted with Mr. Thomas Allen, that by his endeavours the learned Cambden made him his First Reader of his History Lecture which he founded in the University. Soon after he was made Principal of the Hall, the which with his Lecture he kept to his dying day; and was esteemed by some a learned and genteel man, and by others a Calvinist. Having entered at Oxford in the year 1592, aged, as his friend states, nineteen years, the date of his birth must be 1573 ; and it appears from the Fasti of Gloucester Hall, now Worcester College, that he died in 1647, aged there fore 74. His chief works are, Pr\u00e6lectiones Hiemales de Ratione et Methodo Legendi Historias Civiles et Ecclesiasticas ; this work has gone through several editions, and been translated into English."], [704, "234 ILLOGAN.

The pre sent possessor, Francis Basset, Esq. that married the relict of Sir William Gerrard, Knight, and after her decease Pendarves, of Roscrowe family ; his father Lucy, the inhe ritrix of Heale, of Bradinge ; his grandfather, Sir Francis Basset, Anna, daughter of Sir Jonathan Trelawney, Knight. Sir Francis Basset's two younger brothers were bred sol diers; and in the unhappy wars between King Charles I. and his Parliament, were, for their valour and good conduct in his service, knighted, but by the unfortunate end and success of that Prince and his wars, afterwards lived and died under the pressure of misfortune. And here I take it worth remembrance that Sir Fran cis Basset, Knight, aforesaid, in the beginning of the reign of King Charles II. in the morning about ten o'clock on Ty-hyddy downs, himself or his falconer let fly a gos hawk or tassell to a heathpolt or heathcock, which they had there sprung or started on the wing, which birds of game and prey in a short while flew eastwards, over St. Agnes parish, and quite out of sight, so that they despaired of ever finding them again; but, the next day, before"], [706, "236 ILLOGAN. twelve o'clock, to their wonder and amazement, a person sent from the Mayor of Camelford, brought both to Ty hyddy to Sir Francis ; the hawk well and alive, with his varvells on his legs, whereon his owner's name aforesaid was inscribed, but the heathpolt was dead ; which messen ger gave this further account of this rare accident, that the day before, as near as could be computed, about a quar tes or half an hour after ten o'clock in the morning, the said hawk, in the midst of Camelford town, struck down his game dead upon the spot; so that by computation their flight straight forward, only in half an hour's space, was at least thirty-two Cornish miles. For what reason Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, gives such a slighting relation of this famous family, I know not; his words be these: p. 154, Beyond Nants Mr. Basset possesseth Ty-hyddy, who married Godolphin, his father Coffyn, and giveth for his arms as aforesaid. In this parish, at , liveth Reginald An-gove, Gent. i. e. Reginald the Smith, a sirname assumed in memory of his first ancestor, who was by trade and occupation a smith. And of this sort of sirname in England, thus speaks Verstegan, From whence came smith, all be it Knight or 'Squire ? But from the smith that forgeth in the 6re. This Reginald Angove is that subtle crafty tinner, whom common fame reports to have gotten a considerable estate by labouring, adventuring, and dealing in tin, both in the mines below and blowing houses above ground, by indirect arts and practices ; for which, about the 8th of William and Mary, he was indicted before the jury of tinners (whereof the writer of these lines was summoned for one) amongst other things, for putting hard heads of false metal and lead in the midst of slabs of tin, melted and cast in his blowing-house, in testimony whereof some pieces or slabs thereof was cut in pieces, and the fallacy detected ; whereupon the Grand Jury returned the bill of indict-"], [707, "ILLOGAN. 237 ment, indorsed, Billa Vera. But on his trial there was given a verdict of acquittal. Came Bray. Upon the top of a very high rocky moun tain in this parish, which takes a large view over the land from the north to the south sea, that is to say, from St. George's channel to the British ocean, and also towards the Land's End and Scilly islands, stands Castle Carne Bray, erected long before the art of guns was invented. It is situate upon the summit of a large, lofty, and tremendous rock, built four-square of lime and stone, about forty feet high and twenty feet square ; wherein, as appears from the beam holes, windows, and chimneys, were two planchins, besides the leads of the top thereof, though now there are not to be seen either leads or beams, only the walls, windows, chimneys, and garrets thereof are still extant and uniform, which, maugre all the force of wind and weather, are likely to stand firm till the final consummation of all things. It hath but one way of access or entrance into it, through a little hole artificially cut in the rock, under the foundation of its wall, about four feet high; the other parts thereof being surrounded with inaccessible rocks, carnes, and down falls. Some such castle or fortification C\u00e6sar mentions in his Commentary at Uxelodunum, for Uchell-dun-en, i. e. the lofty fort or fortress [in Gallia]. I take this castle to be the Watch Tower mentioned by Orosius, opposite to such another in Gallicia ; which Mr. Carew and Mr. Cam den conjecture stood near St. Ive's. Near this castle, on the top of this mountain, are divers circular walls or forti fications, made of rocks and unwrought stones, after the British manner (see Gonwallo); and a never intermitting spring, or fountain of water, for the use of the inhabitants thereof. Probably this castle was built by some of the Brays of Cornwall, or those that came into England with William the Conqueror of that name, otherwise so called from the natural circumstances of the place, Carne. In this parish also I take it stands another mountain, though of less magnitude, called Carne- Kye ; but this place"], [708, "238 ILLOGAN. is much more famous and notable for the great quantities of tin that have been for many ages, and are still found and brought to land from the bottoms thereof, than for its appellation, to the great enriching its lords of the soil and adventurers. There is no tradition or memory of the person who built this costly and tremendous castle aforesaid, or tower ; or for what use it was made other than to dwell in it, compa ratively above the middle region of the air in those parts, more than what is expressed in the name thereof, Bray's Castle. Undoubtedly whatever human creature it was that dwelt in it and possessed the same, he was a person that had unparalleled confidence in the strength thereof, for his safety and protection, such as never any person after his quitting ever attempted to enjoy for the pleasure of his five senses. TONKIN. Tehidy; this lordship of Tehidy has been for many ages in the possession of the ancient, famous, and knightly family of Bassets, whose ancestors came out of France with William the Conqueror, and were posted among the stand ing troops in this county under Robert Earl of Morton. Most certainly they were possessed of this lordship some short while after the Conquest; and from hence have sprung many noble and famous men in their generation. Then, after copying Mr. Hals, Mr. Tonkin goes on to say, At Carnekye is a considerable tin-work, chiefly pertain ing to the Bassets, out of which has been raised above a hundred thousand pounds worth of tin, to the no small profit of the adventurers and of that family. At Nants or Nance (the valley) was the dwelling of an old and well-regarded family of gentlemen, the Trengoves of Warlegan, the name from Gove, a smith. These gendemen have returned to their ancient habita-"], [709, "ILLOGAN. 239 tion of Trengoff, in the parish of Warlegan ; and the pre sent possessors are denominated Nance from the place, giving for their arms, Argent, a cross Sable. Mr. Tonkin then adds, Tehidy. The first owner that I meet with of this noble lordship was Dunstanville ; and then Basset, who was his grandson or nephew. Reginald de Dunstanville was a Baron of the Realm in the time of King Henry the First, and I take him to be the person meant in Testa de Neville ; ever since which this lordship has been in this ancient and noted family. I shall only add, that the family now resid ing here, are descended from George Basset, the third son of Sir John Basset, of Umberly in Devonshire, and of Tehidy, who had Tehidy for his portion. Leland saith, \" Basset hath a right goodly lordship called Tehidy by the Cornish. There was some time a park, now defaced.\" And well he might call it a right goodly lordship, since it hath the advowsons of three large parishes, this parish, Camborne, and Redruth, with the royalties of wrecks, &c. thereto belonging. The present lord of the manor is John Pendarves Bas sett, Esq. a minor, and at present a Gentleman Commoner of Queen's College, Oxford, who is heir in expectance to his mother of all the estate of Pendarves of Roscrow, and is likely to come into the estate of the greatest of his an cestors in this county, by means of this accession, and of a rich copper mine called the Pool, within this manor, which has been and is still productive of tin and copper very rich in the ore. The arms of Basset are, Or, three bars wavy Gules ; but sometimes these bars are Dancette and the field Argent, as they are painted in the church windows of Camborne and Redruth. The castle and park wall are still standing ; and I have been informed by several old men, particularly by the late Mr. Udy West, of Redruth, that all the rocky grounds under Carnbray Castle, and from thence to Porth-Treth,"], [710, "240 ILLOGAN. were covered with stout trees in their remembrance; so that squirrels (of which there were many) could leap from one tree to the other all the way. These were mostly de stroyed in the Civil Wars, and the rest were cut down by the old Lady Basset, who had it in jointure, so that now there is not the least sign of any trees ever having grown there. THE EDITOR. All the attempts at etymology in relation to this parish have been omitted, on the ground of their not bearing even the slightest resemblance to probability. It has been conjectured that Il-luggan may have some reference to St. Luke, as the parish feast takes place on the nearest Sunday to St. Luke's day, October the 18th. But Luggan, indicating an uncultivated or uninclosed tract of ground, would seem to bear a near relation to the state of this district at no remote period. Mr. Whitaker adheres to Saint Illuggan on account of the parish being designated as Ecclesia Sancti Illogani by the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester in 1294; and by Cardinal Wolsey. It has been already remarked that many of the missionaries from the learned and zealous Convents of Ireland, have left no other trace of their ex istence than the names of parishes where they are usually honoured as Saints ; in the sense probably of Holy, and without implying the technical deification of the Church of Rome, borrowed from ancient Mythology. Saint Il luggan may have been one of those who converted the Celts of Cornwall ; but in the total absence even of tradi tion, this must be a mere conjecture, and the name does not seem to bear any analogy to others established by un questionable authority. Every attempt to decipher Tehidy has utterly failed. Mr. Angowe, who has been brought forward by Mr. Hals in a manner not likely to acquire for him much respect"], [711, "ILLOGAN. 241 trom posterity, resided at Trevenson, and left a son, Mr. Abel Angowe. This gentleman was for some time a student at Oxford, but ultimately preferred the law as an attorney. He married Jane, daughter of Mr. Henry Phil lips, of Carnequidden in Gulval, who lived but a very short time; and Mr. Angowe died in consequence of a fall from his horse about the year 1767. His large pro perty became divided among a great many distant relations, and has almost entirely disappeared. The Angowes held Trevenson on lease for lives; the freehold being in the families of Basset and Praed. Mr. Thomas Kivell, steward to Lord Dunstanville, built a very excellent house there about the year 1800, which has been still further improved by his successor in the stewardship, Mr. Reynolds. Menwinnion existed for centuries as a second house and appendage to Tehidy ; but it is now reduced in size, and converted to a farm. Few parishes in Cornwall have flourished in an equal degree with Illogan. It has abounded in the most produc tive mines of copper ; the dense population consequent to these great sources of employment has covered the tracts formerly waste, with houses, with gardens, and with culti vated fields ; and a safe harbour has been constructed at Portreath, for the reception of vessels engaged in the reci procal trade of exporting annually more than a hundred thousand tons of copper ore to Swansea, and of bringing to Cornwall a still larger quantity of coal. And lastly, on the 25th of October 1809, when a jubilee was held all over England, on the epoch of King George the Third commencing the fiftieth year of his reign, Lord Dunstanville laid the first bar of an iron tram road, for extending far into the country the facilities afforded by this harbour and port, which has since been done; notwith standing a most illiberal attempt by persons interested in the trade on the opposite coast, to convert a local Act of Parliament for improving turnpike roads, the sole object of which must be to render the conveyance of individuals and vol. n. e"], [712, "242 ILLOGAN. of property less expensive and more commodious, into the means of obstructing this great improvement. See the Journals of the House of Commons for the year 1817, and particularly on the 16th of May. But these, and all other improvements in Illogan, and its general prosperity, are mainly owing to the con tinued residence, during six centuries, of one of the most distinguished among those families, which, having entered England in hostile array, assimilated themselves to its laws, its customs, and its institutions ; and have been found, in all succeeding ages, the foremost defenders of its liberties and of its independence. she family of Basset appears to have taken root in various parts of its adopted country. Some branches were probably Barons from the earliest times, some attained that dignity hi subsequent periods; others were distin guished in the law, and all in arms; and what must not be omitted, the signature of Basset is found in the great charters of our liberties, at the ratification of Magna Charta more than six hundred years ago. Mr. Hals brings down the family of Tehidy to Mr. John Pendarves Basset, whom he leaves a Gentleman Com moner of Queen's College, Oxford. This gentleman mar ried Ann, the only daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Prideaux, of Netherton in Devonshire, by Ann Hawkins, daughter of Mr. Philip^ Hawkins, of Pennance, and died of the small-pox in 17$9, at the premature age of twenty five. His brother, Mr. Francis Basset, then took posses sion of the estate; but, unexpectedly to all parties, the widow proved to be with child, and a son was born, who lived to be sixteen, when the uncle came a second time into possession. During this interval, the guardians of young Mr. Basset finished the splendid house at Tehidy, commenced by his father; but, notwithstanding this large expenditure, so great was the product of the mines, and so considerable were the rents of the estate, that Mrs. Basset is said to have acquired above a hundred thousand pounds from her son's"], [713, "ILLOGAN. 243 personal effects ; all of which was naturally left by her among her own relations. Mr. Francis Basset then settled principally at Tehidy ; married Margaret, daughter of Sir John St. Aubyn, and re presented Penryn in Parliament. Mr. Basset had three sisters; one married to the Rev. John Collins, afterwards presented to the rectory of Redruth; Lucy, the second daughter, married Mr. John Enys, of Enys, where his great grandson John Samuel Enys, is now the representative of that ancient family ; the third married Nicholas Sweet Archer, of Trelaske and of Truro. Mr. Basset died in 1769, having only completed his fifty fourth year, leaving two sons, the eldest called after his own name ; and John, who became a clergyman, held the family living of Illogan, married Miss Wingfield, and has left one son. There were also sour daughters ; one married Mr. John Rogers, of Penrose, the other three remained single. Having now arrived at the period when Sir Francis Bas- set, jun. came into possession of the family estate, the Editor would have found it his most pleasing task to trace an outline, however slight, of this distinguished person, in his splendid career through public and through private life. If the topics for his commendation had been in the least degree doubtful, the Editor would, indeed, have dis- trusted his own power of discrimination in reference to one, whom he is proud to claim, as the most liberal, generous, warm-hearted, and disinterested friend that it has been his fortune to obtain in the whole course of a pilgrimage through life, now exceeding sixty-seven years ; but recent events have made recollections painful, which used to be associated with every thing most agreeable to the human mind. Mr. Basset received the earlier part of his education at Harrow; but about the period of his father's decease, he removed to Eton, where, in addition to useful and orna mental learning, these principles of honour and liberality r 2"], [714, "244 ILLOGAN. identified with the character of a true English gentleman, are imbibed, practised, and wrought into habit at the early age when sincerum est vas. After which, one can truly say You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will, But the scent of the roses will hang round it still. After a residence of five years, from twelve to seventeen, at Eton, Mr. Basset became a member of King's College, Cambridge ; and after taking a degree, proceeded on the usual tour through France and Italy, accompanied by the Rev. William Sandys, who, being the son of a former Steward, had received his education for the express pur pose of becoming tutor to Mr. John Pendarves Basset, who is stated above to have died at sixteen. On his return to England, Mr. Basset found himself in possession of abilities, joined to energy of mind; of a large estate, accompanied by great accumulations from the mines; and in addition, of a local influence assuring his introduc tion to Parliament. Thus circumstanced, it was natural for him to take an active share in the politics of his country, especially at a time when party spirit had acquired a height never to be attained but in the midst of civil commotions. The two first Princes of the German line had remained firmly united with the Whig aristocracy, to whom they mainly owed what was then denominated their legitimate or lawful crown, as distinguished from others acquired by conquest or usurpation, or derived from a succession founded on no other title than a mere continuance of pos session ; but the victory of Culloden having finally ex tinguished all hopes in those maintaining, or rather, one may suppose, professing to maintain, indefeasible heredi tary right, and having apparently established the Whigs and the legitimate crown, proved nevertheless to be the cause of their separation, and of the removal of the Whig aristocracy from power at the next accession. A mutual feeling naturally grew up, that time must transfer rights, popularly termed indefeasible, from one"], [715, "ILLOGAN. 245 race to another, when no prospect of restoration remained ; and the advisers of a young monarch might easily per suade him, that new friends, holding such tenets, would prove more acceptable supporters of their adopted crown than those who originally bestowed it on principles of limi tation. Hence the parts imputed to Lord Bute and others, the re-action led by Mr. Wilkes, the letters of Junius, and the final separation of America. From combinations of these and of other causes, Mr. Basset found Lord North first Minister of a Tory admi nistration, and engaged in war with America, and with France, Spain, and Holland; he eagerly joined that party, and was subsequently hurried with it into the most fatal measure that had occurred up to that period, the well known and well remembered coalition. But previously to this time, an event had taken place locally connected with Cornwall, equally honourable to him who conducted a large of body of miners to the relief of Plymouth, and to the miners themselves who volun teered their services. In the latter part of August 1779, the combined fleets of France and Spain most unexpectedly steered into Ply mouth Sound, and anchored nearer to the shore than the base of the present Breakwater. After the splendid successes of the Seven Years' War, marine fortifications had been wholly neglected as utterly useless, as never to be wanted in future times ; but in the sixteenth year after the peace of 1763, the course of events demonstrated, that a naval force may be re-established with much less effeet, and in a shorter space of time, than had been fondly imagined ; and perhaps it also proved, that military navies are not necessarily based on those used for mercantile purposes. A well-founded alarm spread immediately throughout the whole country, that Plymouth was incompetent to sus tain an attack ; when instantly the Cornish miners, worthy of the reputation long enjoyed by their predecessors,"], [716, "246 ILLOGAN. rushed from all directions, and offered themselves as volun teers to assist in defending Plymouth, and to exert their skill and labour in perfecting the works ; and Mr. Basset, acting as his ancestors had done before, immediately placed himself at their head. Thus a large and efficient force was, in the course of a few days, added to our most important western arsenal. On this occasion a patent was conferred on Mr. Basset, creating him a Baronet ; a gift rendered honourable by the cause for which it was bestowed. Since the nautical events of this period have attracted but little attention from general historians, as they failed of producing any decisive result, it may be well to state the most prominent facts. The English fleet had been detained at home by various causes, and especially by the court martial which honour ably acquitted Admiral Keppel. It sailed, however, at last to prevent a junction ofthe French and Spanish fleets, but that junction had been effected; and the combined fleet appeared in Plymouth Sound, while the fleet of Eng land was cruizing near Ushant, or in the Bay of Biscay. Plymouth was undoubtedly open to their attack; and the individual having the civil government ofthe dock-yard, is said to have actually deliberated about taking the last des perate measure, for depriving the enemy of every advantage to be derived from acquiring such stores as might be con sumed by fire. The Ardent, a sixty-four gun ship of the line, arrived from Portsmouth ; and not suspecting that a hostile fleet could appear upon cur coast, and still less occupy our har bours, continued its course into the midst of the ships, and became a prize ; but not without making a brave resistance, and endeavouring to escape by running ashore. The combined fleet, instead of attacking Plymouth, sailed in quest of the adverse fleet, having manifestly taken flieir original course with the view of giving battle ; and what must be mentioned to their honour, not a single act"], [717, "247 ILLOGAN. of wanton hostility was committed on any part of the coast. Every thing remained in suspense ; watch and ward was established at all points. The gentlemen in every parish assembled, such as had arms, to take hasty instructions in military evolutions, while no one ventured to whisper the extent of his apprehensions to others, or even to avow them in his own mind ; when, on the last day of August, both fleets appeared between the Land's End and the Lizard. In the night, or in a fog, the fleets had passed each other ; and the Editor remembers seeing the English fleet collected together in a close mass, making its way up the channel, to the amount of about forty sail of the line, pursued by. the combined fleet of nearly double that number, in what is termed, line of battle a-head. An action now seemed to be inevitable ; but for some unknown cause, the combined fleet discontinued the pur suit and returned to Brest, while the English fleet anchored in Tor Bay. On the dissolution of Parliament in 1784, Sir Francis Basset exerted himself to the utmost, and made large sacri fices of money in support of the unpopular coalition minis try, and he remained stedfast with that defeated party till the whole political hemisphere became changed in every aspect, by an event manifested in one country alone, but originat ing from causes long in action, and imperceptively working throughout an entire change of ancient institutions, with the very form and shape perhaps of civilized society as it previously stood. The conflict of opinion which gave rise to the French Revolution, has but one parallel in the history of mankind ; in the mental agitation, almost amounting to phrensy, which accompanied and urged forward the great change of religion three centuries before. That agitation and con flict still divides Europe, although with diminished vio lence ; and possibly, therefore, an equal period may elapse before the questions, relative to civil government and social"], [718, "248 ILLOGAN. order, shall have received their final settlement, if, indeed, the period is ever to arrive. Most of those in the dawn of youth possessed of eager minds and liberal sentiments, were borne along by the tor rent of passions, excited by new systems, promising universal happiness, with increased wisdom and virtue ; founded on plans for reconstructing human society, derived, it was said, from philosophical investigation, to be substituted in the place of patched and mended institutions, originating with savages in the forests of Scandinavia. But Sir Francis Basset had the advantage of several years passed in active experience with the world. He had learnt that the human faculties are unequal to the formation of systems a priori, but must submit to follow the more humble course of adaptation, tentative experiment, and induction ; and it was manifest that the new political rea soners had entirely omitted to consider the real nature of the vX?j afieraxeipurTT) forming the wide basis of society ; or that they were devising plans not suited to the actual state of things, but to one which they fondly imagined was about to be. Every page of history, moreover, might prove to those willing or desirous of obtaining information from what has actually past, that the crisis of change is invariably bad ; and that objects, attained by the sacrifice of an exist ing generation, have very frequently proved of less value than those for which they had been substituted. Parties, from their very natures, are known to run into extremes; it is probable, therefore, that the leaders opposed to Mr. Pitt professed much greater admiration of the new principles than they really felt; such professions were, however, made ; and Sir Francis Basset concurring in opinion with many of the wisest, the best informed, and of those most deeply interested in the welfare of the country, that the safety of the state wasat issue, addedhis weight to what would now be termed the Conservative scale. Sir Francis Basset, so distinguished by personal quali-"], [719, "249 ILLOGAN. ties and attainments, by the antiquity of his family, by the achievements of his ancestors, and by fortune, had long been designated in public opinion as a person proper to be placed in the House of Peers; and accordingly, on the 17th of July 1796, an hereditary seat in Parliament was be stowed on him by the King, together with the nominal Barony of Dunstanville, so called after Barons of that name, in the time of Henry the First, Henry the Second, Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, John, and Henry the Third, who were equally connected with his family and with the reign ing family of Plantagenet. A second creation took place on the 7th of November in the following year, of Baron Basset, with a special remainder to his daughter in failure of male issue. Lord Dunstanville has from this period continued to support the genuine character of a dignified English gen tleman; discharging his parliamentary duties in the manner deemed most useful to the interests of his country ; exe cuting the office of a magistrate to the benefit, and to the entire satisfaction, of his neighbourhood ; setting an exam ple most worthy of general imitation, as the possessor of an extensive landed estate, and as a most liberal proprietor of mines. Kind and benevolent to every one, esteemed in the highest degree by his private friends and relations, and certainly placed by general acclamation, in regard to all these qualities and circumstances taken together, as by far the first man in the county which he has benefited and adorned. The Editor has written this and inadequate sketch of Lord Dunstanville with a heavy heart ; for although his countenance brightens at the presence of a friend, and memory still presents some images of things past by, and reason continues to discriminate the ideas brought into view, yet such are the ways of Providence, leading, as we hope, believe, and trust to universal good, that a wreck only remains of what used to excite our admi ration, our respect, and our esteem.

Its southern portion rests on granite, which at Carnarthen abounds in shorl; and at Carnkie it contains a bed of porphyry, with crystals of felspar and of shorl ; and at the same place another bed, the basis of which more resembles compact shorl rock than it does com pact felspar. Near Portreath, and from thence to Perth Towan, the slate appears to differ from that of Camborne ; and at Perth Towan it contains short irregular veins of calcareous spar, as at Porthalla in St. Kevern, and at other places on the borders of the calcareous series.

Mr. Tonkin then adds, this estate (as lam better informed) being in the parish of Maker, I shall there treat more fully of it. Sir Richard Champernon, of Madberie in Devon, Knt. had by Catherine his wife, daughter of Ralph Daubeney, Knt. two sons, Richard and John. He died in 1418, and gave this place to the said John, who lived here, and left only one son, a Richard Champernon, who by his wife, the daughter and heir of Sir John Hamley, Knt. left three daughters, one of whom married Humphrey Monck, of Potheridge in Devon, Esq. The said Sir John Champernon was Sheriff of Cornwall 24 Henry VI. 1445, as his son Richard in the first year of Edward IV. 1461. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has not gone into any particulars respecting this parish; but he has occupied several pages with the"], [722, "252 st. John's. real and with the legendary histories of the Evangelist, to whom the Church is dedicated ; these are omitted as un suited to a local history. Mr. Lysons says, that the manor of Tregenhawke, situated partly in this parish and partly in Rume, and feudatory to the manor of East Anthony, did belong to the family of Eliot, by whom it was alienated in 1635 to Richard Treville, merchant; and that from the Trevilles it passed by coheiresses to the families of Cross and Trelawny. The whole now belongs to Lord Graves, who has also the manor of Withroe, called in this parish Winnow. The right of presentation is appendant to the honour of East Anthony. An excavation in the cliff at Whitsand Bay is noticed as having been made by Mr. Luggan, the proprietor of a farm called Freathy, by way of exercise and amusement. The church is, perhaps, of less dimensions than any other in Cornwall, being no more than fifty-six feet long by eighteen in breadth ; it bears the appearance of antiquity, and is decorated by some monuments, one to the family of Beel, with their arms, Azure, three griffins' heads erased Argent.

There hath been for many ages in Cornwall, a certain sort of unlearned men called attornies, who have taken upon them to solve all questions, debts, damages, and dif ficulties whatsoever, by exciting or increasing them, under pretence of friendship and good council, who are often called upon to the assistance of men of lazy or weak under standing to their undoing. For instance thereof, I well remember in this parish of St. Issey there had lived two brethren of the surname of Warne, who having some small disputes or controversies one with the other, not determined, concerning a tenement of land in fee, containing about fifty acres, at a place called ; they appealed to two attornies, viz. Joseph Hawkey, of St. Colomb, and Degory King, of St. Breock in Pider, who run this their controversy so far in law and equity, that they were not able to pay the cost thereof as punctually as those attornies expected; thereupon they"], [724, "254 ST. ISSEY. brought actions at law against their clients for the same, and at length obliged the two brothers of the Warnes afore said, to sell the inheritance of their lands aforesaid to their attornies, the one half thereof to Hawkey and the other moiety thereof to King, now in quiet possession thereof. The inhabitants of this parish will tell you by tradition, that the tutelar guardian of this church is one St. Giggy, who in a place so called in this parish, hath yet extant a walled consecrated well, or spring of water, where hereto fore he heard and judged cases of conscience for the cure of souls; but all further history of him is wanting, save that they tell me St. Issey is only a corruption of Giggy.

This lordship was from Ed ward the Fourth's days one of the dwellings of the Champernons, of Intsworth, near Saltash; and in this place they had a great and magnificent house, as ap pears from the walls and ruinous rubbish and downfalls thereof yet to be seen, as also their domestic chapel and burying place ; in the glass windows of which chapel was lately to be seen this inscription : \" Orate pro anima Do mini Ricardi de Campo Arnulphi; \" and beneath the same his paternal coat armour, viz. Gules, a saltire Varry, be tween twelve cross-crosslets Or; which shews that he de rived his blood and bones from the Champernownes, of Clyst Cbampernowne in Devon. For the Champernownes of Umberleigh and North Taunton, near Modbury, gave for their armes, the one Gules, a saltire Varry ; the other, Gules, a saltire Varry between twelve billets Argent.

He married North, a relation to the Lord Keeper North aforesaid ; his father, Baker, of Lanteglos, by Fowey ; his grandfather Lawry ; and giveth for his arms, Argent, a chevron Azure, between three ducks Proper.

TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing in addition to what is transcribed from Mr. Hals. THE EDITOR. The church of this parish is called in some ancient writings, Eglos-Crock and Nansant. The Dean and Chapter of Exeter are impropriators of the great tithes, and patrons of the vicarage. The church is very old, but deco rated with a lofty tower; there are monuments to Mr. Thomas Carthew, and to some of the vicars. The church town is the largest village in this parish, and lies nearly midway between Padstow and Wade Bridge. Mr. Ly sons says that the manor of St. Ide, extending from this parish into the adjacent parishes of Little Petherick, St. Ervan, Breock, Padstow, and Mawgan, belonged succes sively to the families of Hiwis, Coleshill, and Arundell, and at a later period to the Morices.

This town, as Mr. Camden saith, was formerly called Peiidenis or Pendunes, the head fort, fortress, or fortified place; probably from the little island here, containing about six acres of ground, on which there stands the ruins of a little old fortification and a chapel, betwixt which island and the bending shore, or sea cliff, stands an indifferent safe road for ships to lie at anchor with some winds, which gives opportunity of trade and merchandize to the towns men (whose town is situate thereon) and also for fishing, whereby they have much enriched themselves of late years. The manor of Ludduham, formerly comprehending the parishes of Ludduham, Lelant, Tywednick, and St. Ives, now so many districts, is a lordship of great antiquity, and was privileged with the jurisdiction of a court leet before the Norman Conquest, for under that name it was then taxed (as aforesaid) though its now transnominated to Luggyan Lese ; in which stands the borough of St. Ives, which claims the privileges thereof by prescription and tenure, all which are confirmed by a charter cf incorpora tion from King Charles I. afterwards by another from King James II. by the name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Bur gesses, which consists of a Mayor, ten Aldermen, and eleven Common Councilmen ; the Members of Parliament elected by freemen, alias scot and lot men free there, who sign the indenture ; the arms of which borough is a cluster and branch of grapes or pomegranates; and the precept on the writs for electing Members of Parliament from the Sheriff, or removing any action at law depending in the court leet of St. Ives, the writ must be thus directed : Pre-"], [729, "ST.

Trenwith in this parish, was the voke lands of a con siderable manor, privileged with a court leet before the Norman conquest, that heretofore extended itself over divers parishes ; for by that name it was taxed in Domesday book, 20 William I. 1087, from which place was transno minated an ancient family of gentlemen, now in possession thereof, from that of Bayliff now to Trenwith, who have flourished here in good fame and reputation beyond the memory of man, since Henry VIII. The present posses sor is Thomas Trenwith, Gent, that married Lanyon ; and giveth for his arms, Argent, on a bend cotised Sable, three roses of the Field. Those lands of Trenwith were of old pertaining to the Earls or Kings of Cornwall, afterwards to the Kings of England; and were held by the tenure of knight service by such as possessed them, if not from King Arthur's days, (see Dundagall) yet from WTilliam the Conqueror's, who, in imitation of him, gave bartons, manors, fields, large terri tories of land to his favourites, under the tenures of vil leinage and knight service in capite, by means of which knight service those tenants were obliged to do him any necessary service, either in wars or to his royal person, for the performing whereof he took their oaths in public courts, both of homage and fealty ; and by reason of this s 2"], [730, "260 ST.

Those lands of Trenwith, tempore Henry IV. were held by that tenure in capite by Edmund Plantagenet, alias Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset, grand child to John Duke of Lancaster, 21 Henry VI. 1442, con sisting of four knights' fees, 3 Henry IV. (See Carew's Survey of Cornwall, p. 39). He was slain at the battle of St. Alban's 1450, on the part of Henry VI. against Richard Duke of York ; as also was his son Henry on the same part after the battle of Hexham, and his brother Ed mund after Tewkesbury 1471, beheaded by King Edward IV. and his whole estate confiscated to the Crown ; from whence Bayliff, now Trenwith, purchased part of those lands, which still pays high rent to the Kings of England. In like manner Humphrey Plantagenet, fourth son of King Henry IV. held by the same tenure in Conerton, Biner ton, Drineck, and Ludgian, four knight's fees of land in those places. He was impeached of treason at the Parlia ment held at St. Edmund's Bury in Suffolk ; afterwards murdered ; and those and all other his lands confiscated. TONKIN.

This town is particularly famous for the art of catching fish ; in which trade or occupation of late they have been attended with good success, to the great advancement of their wealth and reputation.

In this port his Majesty hath his Custom House collector, surveyor, comptroller, and waiters, both for sea and land. Trenwith, in this parish, is the seat of an old family of gentlemen, from thence denominated de Trenwith. THE EDITOR. St. Ives has grown, since the time of Mr. Carew, into a place of considerable importance, participating in the gene ral prosperity of the whole country ; and deriving great local advantages from the extension of its fisheries, from the construction of a pier, and from the extraordinary increase of trade at the adjacent port of Hayle. Fish of almost every kind, frequenting the coast of Corn wall, are taken at St. Ives ; but the fishery absorbing all the others in its magnitude is the taking of pilchards. Pilchards are taken in two different ways quite distinct from each other. The first, most ancient, most certain, and therefore of greatest importance to the inhabitants of the neighbour hood, is called drifting. Boats sail in the open sea, drawing after them a great number of nets appended to each other, provided with small leads and corks at the opposite sides, and extending in all to a very great length. The meshes of these nets are made of such a size as to admit the head of a pilchard"], [732, "262 ST. IVES. to pass through them, but not the body ; in consequence such fish as strike against the net are retained suspended by their gills, acting in the nature of a barb. The second method is on a much more extensive scale, uncertain as to success ; but occasionally giving fortunes to those concerned in carrying it on, by the gain of one pros- perous year. This method is sounded entirely on the habit common to all the clupea genus of congregating in large shoals, and coming occasionally near the shore into shallow water, and into places where the ground is free from rocks ; this latter circumstance is peculiarly favourable in the St. Ives Bay, and the ground is moreover covered to the depth of seve ral feet by a fine sand, composed entirely of shells, re duced almost to a state of powder. All the most favourable stations are occupied during the proper season of the year by large boats, having nets on board measuring four hundred and forty yards in length by twenty-seven yards in breadth, capable therefore of covering nearly two and an half statute acres. These nets are provided with very heavy weights at one of their sides, so as to sink them firmly on the ground, and with large corks to make them buoyant on the other. Two large boats and one smaller, as an attendant, are appropriated to each net ; and when a shoal is discovered approaching, by a well-known change of colour and a ripple on the water, these boats, sometimes directed also by signals from the shore, move in opposite directions, extending the immense net to intercept the fish, and then to close it behind them. In this way a quantity suf ficient to fill a thousand casks, after being pressed, have been frequently secured at one time, and on some occasions much more. The casks are hogsheads of fitty-four gallons, and contain about two thousand five hundred pilchards, so that the thousand hogsheads make two millions and a half secured by one net The fish are taken out of the sea by raising them to the surface of the water in smaller nets, used within the great"], [733, "ST. IVES. 263 net forming an artificial pond ; and finally they are dipped up in baskets. The first net, called a seyne, frequently remaining in its original position for several days, or per haps gently slided towards the shore. Pilchards are preserved for exportation in the following manner : they are laid in regular heaps along the sides of walls sheltered by roofs to a height easily reached, and to a depth suited to the ordinary length of the arm, where they are almost concealed by the great quantity of salt strewed with them: three hundred and thirty-six pounds, or three great hundred weight of salt, being allowed for each pressed hogshead. In this state they remain thirty six days, while oil continually oozing from them is received in pits ; they are then rinced in water, and laid with great care in casks made purposely with open joints, where they receive a strong pressure through the medium of a long beam and weights ; more oil is then collected, and the casks, closed up, are fitted for sale. Nine of these packages, in dependent of the wood, are said to weigh two tons ; so that in their final state, the quantity of a thousand hogsheads, not unfrequently caught at one time, must weigh above two hundred and twenty tons. The quantity of oil is very considerable, varying from two to five gallons from each hogshead, but of inferior quality. Pilchards thus cured are called fumados, which seems to imply their having been originally smoked like red herrings ; their chief consumption takes place in Spain and Italy. The pilchards used for home consumption are invariably picked; these are opened and washed, and then rubbed with salt, about seven pounds to the hundred, and pre served in jars or troughs. The herring, pilchard, sprat, anchovy, and several other species, are arranged by icthyologists under the genus clupea ; the herring and pilchard being adjacent to each other. The pilchard is rather less in size than the herring, has larger and firmer scales, and contains much more oil."], [734, "264 ST. IVES. There is one discriminating circumstance quite obvious ; the pilchard, suspended by its dorsal fin, remains in equi librio, while the herring, under similar circumstances, dips towards its head. The pier was built under the authority of an Act of Par liament passed in the year 1767, after a personal survey and a report from the celebrated Mr. Smeaton, which is printed in his works. This shelter from every wind has equally tended to improve the fishery, to increase the general trade of the place, and to protect vessels bound for Hayle ; but the fishery is indebted in a still greater degree to another Act of Parliament, carried through the legisla ture by the late Mr. Humphry Mackworth Praed, who had the honour first of representing this place, and then the county. \u2014 A caution had existed time of mind, by which any boat provided with a seyne net, having taken possession of one of the favourable stations or stems, might retain it till the net had been used to inclose a shoal, or, according to the technical expression, had been shot; and this right ex tended from one season to another : persons in possession of a stem were therefore unwilling to lose it, except for a considerable prize, and small shoals were generally allowed to escape. By Mr. Praed's Act, so great and so beneficial a change was made, that, arranging the succession in an equitable manner, it allowed each boat to hold its stem but for twenty-four hours, and consequently every shoal, how ever small, was eagerly secured. The nets are preserved for a long succession of years by steeping them in a decoction of oak bark as frequently as they are used; and, what would scarcely have been ex pected, the fish oil without this preservative, would destroy the twine in a very short time. It seems that these nets must have been originally intro duced from Dungarvon in Ireland, since they are still said to be braided according to the Dungarvon mesh, but no similar fishery is remembered at that place. Fish, how-"], [735, "ST. IVES. 265 ever, of all kinds not only migrate through distant seas, but without any known cause, frequently leave one part of a coast and resort to another, returning after uncertain intervals to their former haunts. There is one custom at St. Ives, of which the origin and specific meaning are entirely lost. So soon as shoals of pilchards are discovered in the bay, all the people, and more especially the children, run round the town shouting, Heva ! Heva ! with all their might. St. Ives was distinguished in the last century by the birth and residence for some years of a very eminent scho lar, the Rev. Jonathan Toup. His father, who died in 1721, was lecturer of that Town, as the church being a daughter church to Lelant, is entitled to service from the vicar only once in three weeks ; his mother was the heiress of the family of Busvargus, long settled at Busvar gus in St. Just. He was born in 1713; and it is apprehended received the rudiments of classical learning from his father. He became a Commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, and having taken the usual degree of Bachelor of Arts, obtained Holy Orders in 1736. He was Curate of Philleigh in that year, and of Burian in 1738. He continued to pursue, with extraordinary diligence, the study of Greek. He became Rector of St. Martin's, near Looe in 1750, through some private interest; but the Vicarage of St. Merran and a Prebend in the Cathedral of Exeter in 1774, were procured from the Bishop of Exeter by his literary friend Doctor William Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester. Mr. Toup took his Master of Arts degree at Cambridge in 1756, when he had advanced towards the middle of life, and apparently as a qualification for his second living. His chief work is, perhaps, \" Emendationes in Suidam; in quibus plurima loca Veterum Gr\u00e6corum, Sophoclis et Aristophanis in primis, turn explicuntur turn emaculantur.\" These were printed in three parts, which came out in three volumes in the years 1760, 1764, and 1766; and"], [736, "266 ST. IVES. were followed in 1775 by \" Appendiculum Notarumin Sui dam.\" All these have since been reprinted at Leipsic in four volumes octavo; and the whole has been recently in corporated into a most splendid and learned edition of Kusterus' Suidas, by the very Reverend Thomas Gaisford, D.D., Dean of Christ Church, and Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Oxford. Mr. Toup gave also to the world by far the best edition that has appeared of Longinus. He also assisted the cele brated Mr. Thomas Warton in his edition of Theocritus ; and added, \" Cur\u00e6 posteriores, sive Appendicula Notarum atque Emendationum in Theocritum, Oxonii nuperrime publicatum.\" He also published a letter to Bishop Warbur ton under the title of, \" Epistola Critica ad Virum cele berrimum Gulielmum (Warburton) Episcopum Gloces triensem.\" Nothing in particular is remembered of Mr. Toup's private life. He died unmarried at the Rectory of St. Martin's in 1785 ; and the delegates of the Oxford press, in regard for so eminent a scholar, and in return for a pre sent of MSS. made by his niece and executrix, have erected a monument to his memory in St. Martin's Church. Another gentleman, although not a native of the town, may be noticed here. Mr. John Knill was born in the eastern part of Corn wall, and served his clerkship as an attorney in Penzance, from thence he removed to the office of a London attorney, where having distinguished himself by application and intel ligence, he was recommended to the Earl of Buckingham shire, who at that time held the political interest of St. Ives, to be his local agent. After residing for some time at St. Ives, Mr. Knill was sent on a mission to the West Indies, highly honourable to his abilities and to his character, with an authority for in specting all the custom-houses and their establishments ; and, if sufficient cause should appear, with power to sus pend any one, however high, from his office."], [737, "ST. IVES. 267 Having executed the functions thus delegated with inte grity and moderation, he returned to the collectorship at St. Ives, and engaged in a very anomalous undertaking, at that time sanctioned and encouraged by the government, which consisted in equipping small vessels to act as pri viateers against smugglers. In this species of warfare he is said to have been very successful ; and on the breaking out of the Dutch war in the war with America, these vessels were ready to act their part in a practice most disgraceful to a civilized nation, and which every good, honourable, and humane man must hope will never again be repeated. In this way vessels laden with private property, wholly un prepared for resistance, utterly unacquainted with the nations being at war, were plundered and robbed of what ever they contained, and unoffending passengers were ex posed to insult and violence. Mr. Knill was hurried by the force of circumstances, contrary to his inclination and habits, and to his deep sub sequent regret, into doing what others did, and participat ing in these unhallowed gains. The Editor understands, however, that he showed every kindness in his power to some objects of compassion who were made prisoners ; and that he restored several articles of their more valued pro perty at his own individual loss. Soon after this time Mr. Knill took up the singular fancy of erecting a triangular pyramid on a hill overlook in\"- St. Ives, with the intention of his being buried in a proper receptacle hollowed in the base ; and he invested a sum of money in trust for the support of some half ludi crous and half serious dances and processions, to be re- peated every fifth year. He however, removed, to London, resided in Gray's Inn, was called to the bar, and became a bencher ; and having de parted this life on the 29th of March 1811, was buried, by the direction of his last will, in St. Andrew's church, Holborn. The monument is ornamental to the country : on one side ofthe pyramid are inscribed the words, \" John Knill ; \" on a VOL. n. s 6"], [738, "268 ST. IVES. second, \" I know that my Redeemer liveth ; \" and on the third the word \" Resurgam.\" The monument stands on the Editor's land, and pays him sixpence a-year, secured on a farm of some value, with a power of distress. Mr. Knill was undoubtedly a man of considerable talent. When the Earl of Buckinghamshire took the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he selected Mr. Knill for his private secretary ; but not liking the bustle, nor perhaps the responsibility of this situation, he returned to St. Ives. His philanthropy and general kindness were known to all ; but a variety of idle fancies and singularities, unworthy of his talents and experience in the world, are remembered, while the estimable qualities of his heart are perhaps for gotten. An extraordinary event took place at St. Ives on the 17th of Feb. 1780. Some time in the month of December preceding, a large body of troops had been embarked at New York for ihe attack on Charlestown in South Carolina ; and in a public dispatch from Gen. Sir Henry Clinton, dated March the 9th, he says, \" only one ship is missing, having on board a detachment of Hessians ; and supposed to have borne away for the West Indies.\" The Editor has ascertained by par ticular inquiries, that the vessel alluded to in this dispatch nearly reached Charlestown, the place of its destination, hav ing about two hundred and fifty German soldiers on board with provision suited to so short a voyage, when being run soul of by a ship of war in a gale of wind, and injured in the masts and bowsprit, the vessel could sail no other way than before the westerly wind, then blowing with violence; most fortunately the direction of the wind continued steadily in the same direction, and the passengers arrived safe, but nearly famished, at St. Ives on the day above-mentioned. St. Ives and the neighbourhood contended with each other in efforts, not merely to relieve the distress of these unfortu nate persons, but to make them comfortable and happy ;"], [739, "ST. IVES. 269 the best attainable lodgings were provided for the private men, and the officers were daily invited to gentlemen's houses. Their sufferings as foreigners on behalf of Eng land, had excited general compassion, heightened by the reflection that they were not engaged in maintaining any cause in which their country had an interest, that they were not volunteers, but had been purchased by this nation from an . individual entrusted with unlimited power, for the good of a portion of mankind, which he had most basely abused for the sake of private gain, in a manner that must commit his name and memory to infamy, and to the execration of mankind ; nor can the administration be freed from blame that hired these human beings at so much a-day, and agreed to give the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel a certain sum for every one killed, or missing, or lamed. Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin have enumerated several names of families at St. Ives. In recent times, that of Ste phens has acquired an undisputed superiority. That family, although merchants up to the decease of Mr. John Stephens in 1764, bad been long in possession of landed property in St. Ives ; and the Editor has seen the original of the following receipt given at the accession of King James the First. xxii0 die Octobris, An0 Dom1 1603. Received of John Stephens of the Burrough of St. Ives in the Hundred of Penwith, within the county of Corn wall, Gen', for his composition with his Maies Commissioners for his not appearing at the Coronation of our said Souv raigne Lord the King, for to receive the Order of Knight hood, according to his Highness' proclaymasion in that be halfe, the sum of sixteen pounds. I saye received - - - - xvi ' Fra. Godolphin, Coll. Mr. John Stephens married Mary, one of the three daughters of Mr. Samuel Phillips, of Pendrea in Gulval. This gentleman appears to have been very successful in his various concerns of merchandise and fisheries, as he"], [740, "270 ST. IVES. added largely to his landed property by purchases in the immediate neighbourhood of St. Ives, and also in the parishes of Newlyn and St. Enoder. He acted for many years as agent to the Earl of Buckinghamshire in managing the political concerns of the town ; but at last broke off the connection by getting his son, Mr. Samuel Stephens, returned on a vacancy. Mr. John Stephens had a numerous family; his eldest son went to Holland, according to the practice of those times, with the view of continuing his father's mercantile concerns; and the next son, Samuel, became a member of the University of Cambridge to prepare himself for the church, and probably with the expectation of obtaining Lelant and St. Ives, but the death of his elder brother caused this to be relinquished. He married Anne, daugh ter of Mr. Seaborn, of Bristol ; and on his father's de cease about the year 1764, he disposed of every thing con nected with the trade and fishery of this place, and hav ing abandoned the sect of Presbyterians, to which all his family and relations had been strongly attached, he went so far as to pull down the meeting-house, and to withdraw his support from its minister ; proceedings well remembered to his disadvantage on subsequent, occasions. About the year 1774, Mr. Stephens commenced build ing his new house at Tregonna ; and in that and in a subse quent year proved unsuccessful at a poll, and on a petition, for the representation of St. Ives. He died in March 1794, leaving three sons, John Stephens, Rector of Ludg van; Samuel, to whom he devised a large portion of his estate; and Augustus, all of whom have died in the pre sent year (1834) ; also three daughters, Anne, Maria, and Harriet. Mr. Samuel Stephens, the second son, mar ried Betty, sole daughter of Capt. Wallis, the discoverer of Otaheite, and coheiress of the families of Hearle and Payn ter. He represented St. Ives in two Parliaments, and died February the 25th, 1834, leaving five sons, and one daugh ter, married to the Rev. Charles William Davy."], [741, "ST. IVES. 271 Previously to the Act of Parliament of 1832, St. Ives sent two Members to Parliament ; and the right of voting rested in persons paying scot and lot throughout the parish. It now sends one member in conjunction with Lelant and Towednack. The present representative is Mr. James Halse, probably related to the historian : this gentleman is among the most enterprising and successful adventurers in mines of the present day. The situation of the town would seem to be most salu brious, and perhaps it is so in ordinary times ; but few places have suffered more from occasional epidemics. The Editor remembers to have heard dreadful tradi tionary accounts of the plague in 1647. No market was kept in the town for a considerable space of time; but instead of it, supplies were brought to the edge of two streams of water at Polmanter and at Longstone Downs, where provisions were deposited with their prices affixed, which the inhabitants took away, leaving their money in the streams. It it said, however, that the Stephens family having retired to a farm called Aire, which they possessed just out ofthe town, and having there cut off all communi cation with others, entirely escaped, although 535 died in the course of one summer, out of a population which could not at that period have exceeded treble the amount. In the spring of 1786, a sever raged with great violence, to which the reverend Mr. Lane, then lecturer, and Mrs. Lane fell victims within a few days of each other. The whole inscription on the cup given by Sir Francis Basset is as follows : If any discord 'twixt my friends arise Within the borough of beloved St. Ives, It is desired this my cup of love, To everie one a peace-maker may prove ; Then am I blest to have given a legacie, So like my harte unto posteritie.

The church is unusually large and handsome, with a fourth aile at the eastern end, and a lofty tower ; and few prospects are equally beautiful with that of the town and bay from the hill near Tregenna. The parish feast is celebrated at the same time as that of Lelant the mother church ; and Lelant, Redruth, and Crowan, are said to honour St. Eury by holding their feasts on the nearest Sunday to her day, February 1st, but no trace of any such saint can be found.

Mr. Whitaker agrees in assigning to St. Juliet the honour of giving her name to this parish. There seems to be some confusion in Mr. Hals' narrative VOL. n. t"], [744, "274 ST. JULYOT. between the appropriations of the Rectory and of the Vicarage, which Mr. Whitaker endeavours to explain in the following note. \" Mr. Hals has confounded himself by the identity of names. The Rectory of St. Julyot is placed by the first Valor in the Deanery of Trig Minor, and the Chapel of St. Julyot is placed by it; and by the second in that of Trig Major. The former too is rated so high as 12/., while the latter is only 26s. 8d. even at a period so much later. The former therefore is the only large living of Trig Minor that is unnoticed in the first Valor, Lanteglos, correspon dently valued in the second at 34/. 11s. 3d. And the latter is the present St. Julyot, not a Rectory, but a mere Chapel in the first Valor, a mere Curacy Parochial in the second, once appropriated to the Abbey of Tavistock, and therefore having only 15s. certified value at present, the old allocation settled upon it by the Abbey.\" Mr. Hals has given a very long history of Julius, Pope or Bishop of Rome, from the year 343 to 358, which is omitted. Nor is there anything worth relating in the history or legend of St. Julyot. She is said to have suffered death, having been accused by a violent and wicked person who had previously taken from her by force some ample pos sessions. There is extant a sermon of St. Basil in praise of this saint, who is commemorated in the Rituale Ro manum on the 30th of July. The family of Rawle, settled for some time at Leskeard, are said to have originated from Hennot, in this parish.

There was a great controversy in Parliament, 4 James I., between Cotterell and Legrice, about Legrice's lands. See the Memoirs of Parliament, page 68, and modus tenendi Parliamentum. During the interregnumof Cromwell, Sir Richard Vyvyan, as a person dissaffected to his government, was displaced from the gubernation of this Castle, and one Captain Rouse put in his place, which gentleman, as I have been informed, before the war broke out between King Charles I. and his Parliament, was of such low fortune in the world that he lived in a barn at Landrake, and lodged on straw, till he got a commission to be a Captain in the Parliament Army under the Earl of Essex, which brought him into money and credit ; so that at length he was posted the Commander or Governor of this Castle, who behaved himself so very proud, grand, severe, and magisterial towards the neigh-"], [748, "278 ST.

When he lived in a house With an owl and a mouse, Oh ! they say he was wondrous poor Oh! they say. Part of this barn aforesaid, tempore William III., as I am informed, was converted to a dwelling-house, the other part was made a Presbyterian meeting-house, by Mr. Robert Rouse of Wootton, son of the gentleman before mentioned, who with his family commonly on Sundays met there with great numbers of people of that profession, to hear the predicaments of their Priest. This Mr. Robert Rouse married Harrington of Somersetshire, and resided there during his father, the Governor, Rouse's life, with his wife, during which stay there he had by her one or two sons ; and after his father's death, he came down to Wootton in this county.

Mr. Hals has given a long history of St. Just, the com panion of St. Austin, and his successor in the See of Can terbury, all of which is omitted. The parish is supposed to be under the patronage of St. Just, or Justus Archbishop of Lyons, about the year 350. This Saint, already a Bishop, began his career towards beatitude, by assisting St. Ambrose in his furious hostility against the Arians, and completed it by retiring into the deserts of Egypt, to pre pare himself for the society of superior beings, through the favour of Him who is the author of all wisdom, of all knowledge, and of all benevolence, to be obtained by discarding or stupefying in solitude every kind affection, and every faculty of intelligence bestowed on him by the Almighty. He is commemorated in the Roman Calendar on the second of September. St. Mawes and its castle are by far the objects of greatest curiosity in this parish."], [750, "280 ST. JUST, IN ROSELAND. The shelter afforded for boats must at all times have rendered this place a resort of fishermen, but it acquired more importance and a name by the residence of St. Mawes, who seems to have come from Ireland with the other missionaries. Accounts respecting him are extremely various. Some assimilate his history to that of St. Just, stating that he attained the episcopal dignity, and then, in compliance with the taste of that age, retired to an ascetic solitude ; other legends represent him as a schoolmaster, and in early paintings he may be seen with the well-known emblem of scholastic authority in his hand. The castle at St. Mawes was undoubtedly built by King Henry VIII. but a tradition universally believed in Corn wall is much less certain. It is said that the King came to view the situation of his two projected castles of St. Mawes and Pendennis; that he passed two nights at Tolvorn, then a seat of the Arun dells ; and that he crossed the river from thence to Feock, at a passage that has ever since gone by his name. There is not, however, any trace of this journey to be found in histories of the times, nor in any public document. The privilege of sending Members to Parliament was given to this village by Queen Elizabeth, in pursuance, probably, of the Tudor policy noticed under Michell ; and if the creation of a close borough were the object really intended, it proved invariably successful up to the general disfranchisement of 1832. This right of sending Members to Parliament, accom panied by the pageantry of maces and sergeants-at-arms, and combined with various personal advantages, could not fail of exciting feelings of envy and ridicule. In this instance the village of St. Mawes, extending in a single line of houses in the direction of the beach, has readily presented a topic, which was, to inquire whether the new mayor lived on the same side of the street as his prede cessor."], [751, "281 ST. JUST, IN ROSELAND. Corrack Road, the best anchorage for large vessels in all Falmouth harbour, lies off this parish, called by Mr. Hals King Road, but the popular appellation is St. Just, or Sainteast, Pool. Mr. Lysons gives the following inscriptions, said to have been written by Leland, and cut in the castle walls. \" Henricus, Octavus Rex Angli\u00e6, Franci\u00e6, et Hiberni\u00e6 invictissimus, me posuit pr\u00e6sidium reipublic\u00e6, terrorem hostibus.

The advowson of this parish has passed by succession from Tredinham, through Schobells, to Hawkins.

For the modern name, it is taken from the tutelar guardian to whom this church is dedi cated, viz. St. Just the Roman, first Bishop of Rochester, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. At the time of the Norman Conquest this district passed in tax, either under the jurisdiction of Buryan or Alverton. In the taxation of benefices made by the Bishops of Lin coln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, ecclesia Sancti Justi in decanatu de Penwith is rated viii/.; in Wolsey's Inquisition, 1521, 11/. 11s.

JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. 283 On the south side of this parish, upon a lofty hill, stands Chapel Carne Bray, that is to say Bray's spar-stone Chapel, and suitable to its name it is situate upon the top of the most astonishing burrow or tumulus of Carnes, or spar stones, that ever my eyes beheld ; artificially laid together perhaps upon the bodies of human creatures, interred upon the mountain before the fifth century ; on the top of which burrow of stones, which is about fifteen feet high from the ground, stands the chapel itself; which riseth about ten feet higher, well built with moor-stone and lime, with a window in the east, and a durns, or door, on the south of the same stones ; the roof all well covered or arched over with large flat moor-stones, wrought with the hammer and strongly fastened together. The chapel being about ten feet broad and about fourteen feet long (as that on Roach Rock) on the outside; and round this chapel may be seen, the downfalls of many sparstone-stairs and walks, by which heretofore the people ascended to this chapel, and diverted themselves with a full prospect of the contiguous country by sea and land \u2014 St. George's Channel, the British Ocean, and the Atlantic Sea towards the Scilly Islands, of which from hence in fair weather you may have a full view ; which lands of Scilly seem to stand in equal height with this chapel, though the ground towards the Land's End, in St. Leucan and St. Lennan, on the sea-shore towards it, are at least eighty fathoms lower, or under it, as is the sea itself, betwixt that and the Scilly Islands. Such another chapel as this, though not built upon a burrow of stones, is to be seen on Mountague Hill, in Somersetshire, and dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, for half a mile ascended up the hill upon stone stairs, embowed or arched over head right artificially. (See also Camden in Somerset.) Thus it appears that this tribe of Bray were heretofore men of great wealth, fame, and renown in those parts ; since their name adheres not only to two local places in this parish, but divers others, as Castle Carne Bray in Luggan, Bray in Morvall, and many other places."], [754, "284 ST. JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. In this parish also was formerly St. Ewny's Chapel, now dilapidated ; see Redruth and Lelant for more of this St. Ewny. Those spar-stone monuments of Carne Bray Castle, and Chapel Carne Bray aforesaid, will I suppose perpetuate the name and memory of those Brays till the final con summation of all things, as aforesaid. Bray, in Battle Abbey Roll, is recorded to have come into England with William the Conqueror ; but by the names of those local places and the fabrics aforesaid, it is probable they were here long before. In this parish is a large flat stone, on which, as tra dition says, seven Saxon Kings at one time and day, dined thereon, at such time as they came into Cornwall to see the Land's End thereof, and of Great Britain ; which Kings are said to have been : 1. Ethelbert, 5th King of Kent ; 2. Cissa, 2nd King of the South Saxons ; 3. Kingills, 6th King of the West Saxons; 4. Sebert, 3d King of the East Saxons; 5. Ethelfred, 7th King ofthe Northumbers; 6. Penda, 5th King ofthe Mercians; and 7. Sigebert, 5th King of the East Angles ; who all flourished about the year 600, and were all crowned heads, as Samuel Daniell in his Chronicle tells us. * TONKIN Has not any thing in addition to what is stated by Mr. Hals, except a description of Mayne Scriffer, or the \"in scribed stone,\" which he ends by saying is really not in this parish, but in Madders, where he purposes to give a more full account of it.

Here were born his two sons the Rev. Walter Borlase, LL.D. Vice Warden of the Stannaries ; and the Rev. William Borlase, LL.D. by diploma from the university of Oxford, the justly cele brated writer of the Antiquities and of the Natural History of Cornwall. Pendeen exhibits an excellent specimen of the large but comfortless houses, inhabited by gentlemen two centuries ago. Near the house may be seen one of those very ancient excavations called vaus or faus. See Borlase's Antiquities, p. 293, 2d edit. 1769. They are conjectured to have been made for places of refuge in times when predatory descents on the coast were of frequent occurrence, and always causes of alarm. Yet the entrance could not be concealed, and the five kings of the Amorites had left an example, con firmed at no remote period by the cruel fate of a northern clan, proving the utter insecurity of such a retreat. On the sea-shore below the house is a small cove, where boats and nets are kept for fishing; but so small is the shelter on this iron-bound coast, that the boats are drawn up by ropes or chains, and kept suspended during the winter, on the sloping surface of a steep cliff. Some miles westward of Pendeen, and near the sea, is Botallock, the seat of the Usticks ; one among the many families that resided for centuries in this remote peninsula, moderately endowed with gifts of fortune, but possessed of the honour and feelings of gentlemen. This parish has been productive of tin from the most early periods ; and Botallock would have elevated its pro prietors in the scale of wealth, but times and manners had changed, so that the last Mr. Ustick of that place having spent his estate, and then got it redeemed by a productive mine, sold it at last to Admiral Boscawen, to whose grand son the property now belongs. The veins or lodes of tin"], [756, "286 ST. JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. having been wrought within the last fifty years to depths unattainable before the introduction of improved steam engines, copper has, in very many instances, been found under the tin; and this has occurred at Botallock, where situated on the edge of a cliff, the workings with the steam engines, whims, &c. present a spectacle more unique and more imposing than any other in Cornwall. Further from the shore is Busvargus, the seat of an ancient family of the same name, the heiress of which was the mother of the Rev. Jonathan Toup, whose eminence as a scholar has been noticed under St. Ives. He died with out issue in 1785; and the estate of Busvargus, having been settled on the children of his half-sister, is now the property of his niece, Mrs. Nicholas of Looe, the present representative of the Busvargus family. The families of most distinction in latter times, inhabit ants of St. Just, were Allan and Moddern, but both names are now extinct. The great tithes appertained to the monastery of Glaseney, in Penryn. They now belong lo Borlase. The vicarage is in the presentation of the crown, and was held for many years by Doctor William Borlase, the his torian. And here perhaps the Editor may be allowed to mention the name of one whom he esteemed and admired, although his connection with Cornwall was so little permanent as to consist only of his serving the curacy of this parish. The Reverend John Smyth, Fellow of Pembroke Col lege, Oxford, received his title for deacon's orders from Doctor William Borlase, as vicar of St. Just, where he re mained about six or seven years, till Cornwall lost one of its greatest ornaments. Leaving St. Just, after Doctor Borlase's decease, he be came the friend and assistant of the Reverend Sir Richard Kaye, Dean of Lincoln, and through his recommendation made the tour of Europe with Mr. Langley, a gentleman of Yorkshire. He then went back to College, and on a vacancy"], [757, "ST. JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. 287 became tutor, and succeeded to the Headship; return ing from a visit to Penzance, in I8O9, he died in conse quence of some local complaint at Exeter, where a monu ment has been placed to his memory in the Cathedral Church, with the following inscription: Juxta conditur Joannes Smyth, S. T. P. Magister Collegii Pembrochi\u00e6 apud Oxonienses, Qui Academiam remeans, hae in Urbe, vi morbi grassantis, cito abreptus est, die 19 Octobris, A.D. 1809, \u00e6tatis su\u00e6 66.

There is also a cenotaph in the Cathedral at Gloucester, a prebend of which church is annexed to the mastership of Pembroke College, by the liberality of Queen Anne. Few men were ever more universally esteemed, or were more deserving of being so. His abilities and learning commanded respect; kindness, generosity, and benevolence endeared him to every friend ; whilst good nature and con vivial manners made him the favorite of each casual ac quaintance. To him the Editor is indebted for his good fortune in being himself a member of Pembroke College. The parish feast is celebrated on the Sunday nearest to All Saints, November the first ; but the church is known to claim for its patron St. Just, the companion of St. Aus tin, Bishop of Rochester, and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. Little is handed down to posterity of St. Just, but that little is entirely to his praise ; at the com mand of Pope Gregory the Great, he undertook the perilous but successful service of converting the Eng lish Saxons ; he attained the highest ecclesiastical dignity from the suffrages of those who had been brought by the"], [758, "288 ST. JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. labours of St. Austin and of his followers, within the pale of the church ; and he obtained deserved commendation from Pope Boniface, either the third or fourth, who with one intermediate Pope, were the successors of St. Gregory, when the apostolic confirmation of his appointment to the metropolitan see was given, and himself honoured by the investure of a pall. He is stated in the Rubrics to have died on the 10th of November in the year 627. Nothing seems to be more obvious, or to be more con genial to the human mind, than an annual celebration of particular events. Nature has completed in twelve months the most distinctly marked of her cycles. The seasons are renewed in the same order ; and, if experience did not soon convince us of the contrary, we might be induced to think that our own existence in this world was destined to tread the same perpetual round. Birth-days appear to have been celebrated in honour of living persons from times the most remote, either by nations, provinces, or private families, in proportion as their claims to attention were more or less wide. After the decease of those who have been supposed to confer benefits on man kind, \" Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo,\" and more especially of those to whom nations owed their spi ritual light and hopes, the days of such persons leaving this scene of trial, of sorrow, of anxiety, and of disappoint ment, to obtain their reward in Heaven, became epochs for uniting religious observance with joy and gladness. Churches were, therefore, dedicated to their memories and festivals instituted ; but in England at least this instinctive propensity received the aid of a policy similar to that which, in still earlier periods, had fixed the Christian festivals on the very days previously occupied by the celebration of ancient superstition. Bede has preserved the following letter from Pope Gregory to St. Mellitus, who led a second band of missionaries into England, after the successful preaching of St. Austin, and became the first Bishop of London, where he is said to have founded the two Cathedrals, and finally to have attained the Archbishopric of Canterbury."], [759, "ST.

It has been long cele- brated lor its mines, which generally are placed on or near"], [761, "ST. JUST, NEAR PENZANCE. 291 to the junction of the granite and the slate; and in conse quence of the narrow limits of the latter rock, their work ings often extend under the sea. Botallack mine is a noted instance of this description ; and its steam engine and ma chinery, perched on the side of a steep rocky cliff, present one of the most picturesque objects in the country. St. Just has afforded specimens of by far the greater number of British minerals. Its slate has a basis of compact fel spar, and exhibits many interesting varieties of this rock ; but the most rare is that which abounds with disseminated garnets at Botallack. The principal lodes of this parish exhibit some peculiarities in their direction, and the little coves are generally covered with beds of diluvium, some of which are composed of large granitic pebbles and boulders, which appear to have once formed a beach, although at present they are elevated above high-water mark. St. Just abounds with so many interesting objects as to make it im possible to enumerate them in these short notices. Ample details may be found of all these productions in the Trans actions of the Geological Society of Cornwall. ST. KEYNE. HALS.

The presidual guardian of this church is one of those two holy women mentioned by writers as famous for their piety and supernatural facts ; the one of the British blood, the other of Saxon race. That of the British is St. Kayne, daughter of Braghan, king and builder of the town of Brecknock in Wales, who flourished about the year 500 ; the which King Braghan had issue also twenty-three other daughters, all for the like reasons aforesaid entered into the catalogue or calendar of saints ; and also two sons, St. Ca nock and St. Caddock, to whose honour and memory a chapel in Padstow parish was erected; and still, though disused from divine service, bearing his name. The other St. Kayne was born about the seventh century, upon the river Avon in Somersetshire, at a place which after her decease sprung up a town, still flourishing in fame and wealth, from her denominated Kainsham, i. e. Kain's house, home, habitation, or dwelling. She is famous amongst agonal writers for miracle working, particularly for turn ing serpents into stones wheresoever she saw them, so that they had not power either to hurt man or beast ; a woman very much wanted now in Cornwall, where adders or ser pents abound to the great hurt of man and beast. She is also highly praised by John Capgrave in his book of the English Saints, for her purity, piety, and chastity. To one of these two women is also dedicated the vicar age church of Cainham, in Holderness hundred in York ; as also Caynham vicarage church in Ludlow hundred in Salop. In this parish at lived some of the Coplestons of Colbrook in Devon, as I take it; which place descended to them by some of the heirs of Flemmen, Berkley, Tur vey, Courtney, Bonvill, Pawlet, Chichester, Bridges, Graas, Hawley, Huish, Wiedbury, Fitzwalter, or some others, which they married with successively ; and thereby obtained"], [763, "ST. KEYNE. 293 such a mighty estate in Cornwall and Devon that they were generally distinguished by the name of the \" great Cople- stons.\" But, alas! maugre all their great riches and wealth, the last John Great Coplestone, tempore Elizabeth, for kil- ling his natural son and godson in discontent, was indicted at the assizes at Exeter, tried and found guilty of wilful mur- der, and sentenced to death for the same ; and lay in gaol till he sold thirteen manors of land in Cornwall to obtain a reprieve or pardon ; and left of legal issue only one son, named John, who had issue only two daughters that became his heirs ; married to Bamphield and Elford, in whom the estate, name, and blood of those Coplestons is terminated, who gave for their arms, Argent, a chevron Gules, be- tween three leopards' faces Azure. These gentlemen were hereditary esquires of the white spur, who, together with the Champernowns and the Carmenows, possessed and en joyed the profits of their private estates in Devon and Corn- wall, to that great degree, in former ages, that the like great riches was not then to be found in any other family for value in those counties, though now I know not of any lands in Cornwall remaining in those tribes, or any of those names now extant there. TONKIN. Camden, in Somersetshire, mentions Keine as a devout British Virgin, whom many of the last age, through an over credulous temper, believed to have changed serpents into stones, because they find sometimes in quarries some such little miracles of sporting nature. She is said to have been born on the banks of the river Avon in that county, at the place where after her decease sprung up a town, from her denominated Keynesham. She is famous among the agonal writers for her purity, piety, and charity, as also for many miracles, particularly for turning serpents into stones. There was one other St. Keyne famous among the Bri tains of Wales, daughter to Brechanus, King, and namer"], [764, "294 ST. KEYNE. of Brecknock Town. He had twenty-four daughters and two sons, all Saints. It is possible, however, that both these St. Keynes may be one and the samt. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons says, that the ancient name of this parish was Lametton, and that the manor still exists. This manor he further states was the property of Sir Robert Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, attainted in the reign of King Richard the Second, by whom this portion of his property was bestowed on John Hawley, of Dartmouth, supposed to have married a daugh ter of the Chief Justice. His daughter and heiress brought it to the Coplestones. Jn the reign of James the First it belonged to the Har risons of Mount Radford in Devonshire, and from them it passed by marriage to the Rashleighs. Mr. William Rashleigh, of Menabilly, is now the pro prietor of the whole or nearly the whole of this parish, and in it of the celebrated well, which Mr. Carew notices in the following manner, p. 305, Lord Dunstanville's edit. \" Next I will relate to you another of the Cornish na tural wonders, viz. Saint Keyne's Well ; but lest you make wonder, first at the Saint before you notice the well, you must understand that this was not Kayne the Manqueller, but one of a gentler spirit and milder sex, to wit, a woman.

Mr. Tonkin quotes this passage from Carew, and adds : \" Did it retain this wondrous quality, as it does to this day the shape, I believe there would be to it a greater resort of both sexes than either to Bath or Tunbridge ; for who would not be fond of attaining this longed-for sove reignty?\" And Mr. Tonkin adds further, \"since the writing of this the trees were blown down by a violent storm ; and in their place Mr. Rashleigh, in whose land it is, has planted two oaks, an ash, and an elm, which thrive very well ; but the wonderful arch is destroyed.\" For a most interesting account of St. Keyne's Well, and of all that portion of Cornwall, the reader is referred to Mr. Bond's \" Topographical and Historical Sketches of East and West Looe, and of the Neighbourhood,\" 1 vol. 8vo. 1823, printed by John Nichols and Son, No. 25, Par liament Street, Westminster. Mr. Bond says that the trees were blown down by the great storm of November 1703, and that Mr. Philip Rash leigh, who succeeded his father in the property about that time, planted soon afterwards the^fees which have now acquired their full growth, and probably equalled those which stood there before them. Mr. Bond has also printed the beautiful as well as hu morous lines composed by Mr. Southey, and referred to other verses on the same subject in the Gentleman's Ma gazine for June 1822, vol. xcii. i. p. 526.

An oak and an elm tree stand behind, And beside does an ash-tree grow ; And a willow, from the bank above, Droops to the water below. A trav'ller came to the Well of St. Keyne ; Pleasant it was to his eye, For from cock-crowing he had travelling been, And there was not a cloud in the sky. He drank of the water so cool and clear, For thirsty and hot was he ; And he sat down upon a bank All under the willow tree. There came a man from the neighbouring town, At the Well to fill his pail ; So on the well side he rested it, And bade the stranger hail. \" Now art thou a bachelor, stranger ? \" quoth he, \" For if thou hast a wife, The happiest draught thou hast drank to-day That ever thou didst in thy life. \" Or has your good woman, if one you have, In Cornwall ever been ? For, and if she have, I '11 venture my life She has drank of the Well of St. Keyne.\""], [767, "297 ST. KEYNE. \" I left a good woman who never was here,\" The stranger he made reply, \" But that my draught should be better for that, I pray you answer me why.\" \" St. Keyne,\" quoth the countryman, \" many a time Drank of this crystal Well ; And before the angel summon'd her hence, She laid on the water a spell : \u2014 \" If the husband of this gifted Well Shall drink before his wife A happy man thenceforth is he, For he shall be master for life. \" But if the wife should drink of it first, God help the husband then ! \" The stranger stoopt to the Well ofSt Keyne, And he drank ofthe water again ! ! \" You drank of the Well, I warrant, betime ? \" He to the countryman said: But the countryman smiled, as the stranger spoke, And sheepishly shook his head. \" I hasten'd, as soon as the wedding was done, And left my wife in the porch ; But i' faith ! she had been wiser than me, \u2014 For she took a bottle to church.\" It is almost unnecessary to observe, that the stones said to originate from serpents petrified at the intercession of St. Keyne or St. Kenna, and supposed by Mr. Tonkin, ac cording to the philosophy of his day, to be Lusus Natur\u0153, are the shells of extinct Nautili, called Cornua Ammonis, from their resemblance to the horns sculptured on the statues of Jupiter Ammon, found in abundance throughout the neighbourhood of Kainsham, and in most of the for mations intermediate between the iron sand and red marie. Transforming serpents into stone, seems to have been an achievement as appropriate to Saints as was the encounter-"], [768, "298 ST. KEYNE. ing of dragons to knights errant. St. Hilda cleared her favourite Island from these venomous reptiles ; and St. Patrick, more powerfully gifted, swept them from the whole of Ireland at once. It was at last observed, with no small degree of wonder, that those metamorphosed snakes invariably wanted a head, and the times of fabricating legends having passed by, this phenomenon never received a solution from the cloister. St. Brechan, the British Saint and King, the happy father of twenty-six children, all sainted like himself, is represented in the second plate of St. Neot's Church, in what is called the Young Women's Window, displaying these twenty-six Saints, small in stature, within a fold of his kingly robe.

It was taxed in the Domes day Book, 20 William I., 1087, by the name of Landegey, (and from thence the manor of Lan -digge in this parish, contiguous therewith, and surrounding the same, is deno minated ; now corrupted to Lansagey, alias Keye.) From whence it is plainly evident that before the Norman Con quest here was an endowed rectory church that received tithes or tenths, of the profits of the earth, predial or otherwise, towards the maintenance of the worship and service of God, and doubtless invested with that benefit by the Bishop of Bodmin or Cornwall, before that was united to Kirton and Exeter.

I take this place either to be part of or the voke lands of the manor of Blanchland, i. e. white land, formerly the lands of Albalanda, now Boscawen's of Tregothnan, the waste lands of which lordship is not only abounding in tin and tin mines, but for about twenty years last past hath yielded its owner about twenty thousand pounds out of its coppermines, though the waste or down lands in which it is found, is in many places scarce worth eighteen pence per acre. Guddarne in this parish, part of Blanchland manor, by lease is the dwelling of Reginald Bauden, Gent, that mar ried Pendarves, his father Paynter, his grandfather Tre woolla. In this place of Guddarne, in my youth, I was showed by Mr. Bauden a brass or iron crock, containing about eight gallons ; wherein, as he said, his father sound by virtue of a dream of one Hendra, under Key Cross, in a tempestuous night of wind, thunder, lightning, and rain, so vast a quantity of gold and silver as not only advanced him from the rank of rack-renter to that of a freeholder, but from the distinction of a plebeian to that of a gentle man. Kelleho, Kellyow, Killeyow, synonymous words in this parish, id est Hazell Copps, a place it seems heretofore notable for those sort of nut trees called hazells, one of the sweetest and best sorts of nuts this island affordeth, if left to grow full ripe and well saved.

Trelogas, in this parish, is the dwelling of Robert White, Gent, that married Philips, of Poughill. From this family was descended Mr. John White, linen draper in London, who having got much money by trad ing in tin, settled lands of ten pounds per annum beyond reprizes for ever, to be divided into four equal parts, be-"], [771, "KEA 301 tween the poor inhabitants of the four ancient coinage towns in Cornwall, viz. Leskeard, Lestwithell, Truro, and Helston ; to be distributed by the ministers and church wardens of those churches on St. John's day yearly ; the remainder, being forty shillings, to be divided into four equal parts between the four ministers of those churches, who on that day in their respective churches annually are to preach an anniversary sermon in remembrance of him for ever, of which elsewhere (see Truro.) In this parish of Kea on the open downs, by the high way or street, are situate the four burrows, i. e. the four sepul chres, tumuli, or graves, after the British-Roman manner, to put those travellers that passed by in mind of mortality and death ; one of them is called Burrow Bel-les, i. e. the far off, remote, broad or large burrow or sepulchre, (viz. on the confines of this parish) and suitable to its other names it is one of the broadest or largest burrows in those parts ; into which some tinners, temp. William III. in hopes of finding money, pierced a hole or adit into the centre thereof, where, though they missed their expectations they found in the same two of the broadest and flat moor-stones as a cover, supported by three perpendicular stones of suitable strength or bigness, that they had seen in the ad jacent country. In the vacant space, vault, or arch under those stones, they found decayed or broken pieces of the urn or ossilegium, and about a gallon of black matter and ashes, which doubtless was the gleanings or remains of that once famous human creature, before the fifth century interred here, with many thousands others, doubtless of less degree in the contiguous lands thereof, who had not money to raise such troublesome, laborious, and costly fu neral monuments as those four burrows were, and still are.

I take the name to be a corruption of Caius; and that St. Caius, Pope and kinsman to the Emperor Dioclesian, who suffered martyrdom under the said Emperor in 296, is the tutelar patron of this church, which is a daughter to Ken wyn, and passes in the same presentation, being valued with it in the King's Books at 16/. The patronage in the Bishop of Exeter. The incumbent Mr. Mitchell, the oldest clergyman now living in this county ; who though aged, and his churches three miles apart from each other, regularly serves them both every Sunday ; he is since dead, in 1731, and has been succeeded by the Reverend Walter Borlase, LL.D. and vicar of Maddern. In this parish lies the extensive manor of Blanchland, latinized into Albalonda. This manor gave name to a considerable family, in which it continued for many de scents. The last of them, Otho de Albalonda, had only one daughter and heir, Johanna, married in his lifetime to John Boscawen, of Tregothnon, in the 31st year of Ed ward III. and carried this rich inheritance into that family; in which it hath ever since continued, to their very great advantage, having within these fifty years brought them more money for copper than almost all the other mines in the county together, if the last twenty years are excepted, during which time great discoveries have been made in various other places. Neither are the wastrels of this manor destitute of good mines of tin ; one of which, called the White Works, occasioned a law-suit between Mr. John Mayo, of Truro, owner of the tin bounds thereon, and Mr. Hugh Boscawen, lord of the soil, towards the latter end of the reign of Charles the Second. Mr. Mayo claimed the farm or toll of the copper-ore,"], [773, "303 KEA as well as of the tin, in right of his bounds; but the suit was very justly determined in favour of Mr. Boscawen, as Lord ofthe Soil, for that the right ofthe tin as bounder was only by the custom ofthe Stannaries, and that no such custom could be pleaded for copper ore. This one suit put an end to all disputes between the lords of the soil and the bounders, which otherwise would have been endless, and very much to the discou ragement of copper mines ; and there have not been wanting some designing people of late, who made applica tion to King George II. then Prince of Wales, falsely re presenting that much tin ore was carried into Wales with the copper ore, and there separated from the copper, to his great loss of duties. Guddern. This place hath been for several generations the seat, on lease from the family of Boscawen, of the Bow dens ; perhaps ever since the Albalonda's time, although they were possessed of fair estates in fee elsewhere. Reginald Bowden, Esq. is the present possessor. Nansavallan. Avallan is an apple-tree, and the name signifies the valley of apple-trees. This I take to have been the chief seat of the Albalondas, as it hath been since of some of the Boscawens ; and particularly of late years that of Charles Boscawen, Esq. a younger son to Hugh Boscawen, Esq. and sometime Member of Parliament for Tregony, and a Justice of the Peace. The arms of Alba londa were, Gules, three bends Argent; Mr. Bowden's, Azure, a chevron between seven griffins' heads couped Or, each head transfixed by a dagger, the pommel Or, the blade Proper. Adjoining to Nansavallan is Kelliou, the groves, this name being the plural of Kelli, a grove. It was once the seat of a family of the same name, but whether they were of the same stock with the Kellios of Lanleke and Rosi line I am yet to learn. By a daughter and heir, this place, if I am not mistaken, came to Edward Vivian, Esq, a younger son to Vivian of Trenoweth, by whom he had only"], [774, "304 KEA one daughter and heir Jane, married to John Howeis, of Redruth, whose great-grandson Reginald Howeis, Esq. is the present owner of it. He was Sheriff of Cornwall in the tenth year of George I. 1724, and hath married Su sanna, the eldest daughter and coheir of Edward Harris, Esq. ; and his brother Edward Howeis, Jane her younger sister, and both have issue. The family of Howeis, give for their arms, Azure, a fess wavy between three lions pas sant Or, armed and langued Gules. Trevoster. This place is very pleasantly situated on Truro river, facing the town, from which it is but two miles distant by water. This was a seat of a younger branch of the Trevanion family, for here lived John Trevanion, youngest son of John Trevanion, of Carhays, Esq. which John Trevanion had by his wife, the daugh ter of Holland, Esq. of Devonshire, a son of the same name, who married Marianne, the daughter of John Somaster, of Painsford, in Devon, Esq. by whom he had three daughters and coheiresses. Mary, married to Richard Trefusis, of Trefusis, Esq. ; Joan, to William Bligh, of Botathon, Esq.; and Alice to Nicholas Bos cawen, of Tregothnan, Esq. Since that, Trevoster has been held on lease by one of the family of Davies, and now Mr. Howeis, of Killion, has a lease of it on lives. All these estates before mentioned, I take to be within the manor of Blanchland, and I have passed by one place in it to the north-west of the Great Works, called Kelly freth : this was for several generations the seat, in lease from the Boscawens, of the Winters, a younger branch of that eminent family in Gloucestershire, and the family remained here till very lately, giving for their arms, Sable, a fess Ermine. I don't know whether it be worth while to take notice of a place to the south of it, called Chase Water, which being on the great road between Truro and Redruth, and very near the Great Works, hath now several nouses built in it."], [775, "305 KEA The manor of Key, alias Landegay. I take this to be the same with that called by Mr. Carew Landegy. I find this parish called Ecclesia de Landigay. This manor was forfeited by Francis Tregion, Esq. with the rest of his estate, as may be seen in Probus. About the 8th or 9th Charles I. this manor was given or sold for a small sum by the King to William Coryton, of Newton, Esq. in whose family it hath remained ever since. On the commons belonging to Guddern is a large barrow called Guddern Barrow, near which are several large moorstones ; and also at no great distance is another bar row, called Craig Vrause, or the large barrowr, remarkable for giving name to some good mines of tin and copper near it. THE EDITOR. All the legends of this parish concur in claiming for their patron Saint Kea, one of the great company of missionaries, and as the ludicrous, almost from a species of fatality, ap- pears to have blended itself with these ancient tales, a large block of granite, hollow on one side, which happened to lie near the bank ofthe river, was for centuries pointed out as the boat used by St. Kea to waft himself from Ireland to the Cornish shore ; and so currently was this story re peated, that, if persons went to sea in a vessel not adequate to the service, it was observed they might as well have made a voyage with St. Kea in his moorstone trough. Mr. Hals having used a strange orthography for Nansa- vallan, and given as fanciful a derivation of the word ; both are omitted, since Nans or Nance is known to be a vale ; and Avallan may be proved to be the Celtic name of an apple, by referring to the History of Glastonbury. This seat of the Albalandas presented within fifty years one of the most venerable specimens in all that neighbourhood of the dwell ings used by gentlemen of consideration in former times. It was entirely surrounded and sheltered by large trees, VOL. II. x"], [776, "306 KEA and at some little distance stood a wood more extensive than any one west of it ; and both were conspicuous and pleasing objects from the whole district round Truro; but the auri sacri fames has swept away the whole, and the place is now become very little preferable to an open down. The Editor expresses himself with some feeling on this subject, having passed at Nanceavallan many happy weeks of his childhood ; and fancied the wood an exact counterpart of that in which the favourite objects of infantine compassion perished from want of food, and were painfully covered over with leaves by the little bird, doubly consecrated by this effort of his kindness. In the hands of the proprietor, the farm of Nanceavallan is however now improving, by extensive drainages, and by a system of husbandry, that cannot fail of extending the benefit derived from example to all the neighbourhood. Killiow is now the seat of Mr. Robert Lovell Gwatkin, where he has built an almost entirely new house with ex tensive gardens and plantations, improved the land, and made the whole into a handsome modern residence. To this gentleman the parish is also mainly indebted for a removal of the church. Either cultivation began on the banks of the river, or a strong feeling of veneration was entertained for the spot where St. Kea landed from his granite trough, but so it happened that the church stood at one extremity of the parish, and that by far the least populous. Mr. Gwatkin led the way, and contributed largely towards constructing a new church much nearer to the great mass of the inha bitants ; in this he was followed by other proprietors, and a spacious church is now in use for divine service between Killiow and Nanceavallan. Prayers, with a sermon suited to the occasion, were first given, after reading the Bishop's license, on the 3d of October 1802, being the feasten Sun day, to a congregation so large as almost to fill the church yard as well as the church itself, which is decorated by Mrs. Gwatkin, niece of Sir Joshua Reynolds, with paint ings which that great artist could not have failed to admire."], [777, "KEA. 307 The tower alone remains to point out the site of the for mer church. Mr. Reginald Haweis, mentioned as the possessor of Killiow by Hals, received his education as a Gentleman Commoner of Exeter College ; but he spent the whole of the remainder of his life in retirement. One Oxford anecdote he used to relate with peculiar pleasure. It seems that he was selected to recite some Latin verses in the theatre, commemorating the victory of Blenheim, an event without parallel in the modern history of Europe till the year 1815. In the verses occurred this apostrophe, Quo, Tallarde ! ruis ? and as Mr. Haweis was actually pronouncing these words, the Duke of Marlborough with Marshal Tallard entered the theatre, amidst thunders of applause. But possibly the entrance of Marshal Tallard may be a mistake. Mr. Reginald Haweis and his brother Edward, both stated to have families, died childless ; and the estate de volved on Mr. David Haweis, the grandson of an uncle. That uncle had been a beneficed clergyman, but was deprived with the two thousand turned out to poverty and to suffer persecution (see St. Hilary parish) on St. Bartho lomew's day 1662 ; a day ill chosen by those who might recollect what happened on the same festival ninety years before. This gentleman having a family, and being without sup port, found himself obliged to dispose of them in any way to procure their own maintenance, and his eldest son sub mitted to become a barber. His son was apprenticed to the same trade; and on him the estate devolved. He mar ried a gentlewoman, Miss Kempe, of Roseland ; but per severing in low habits of intemperance, the peculiar vice of that time, he died at an early age, leaving the property to his widow for her life, with the remainder to his sisters. They were married, and in stations not more elevated than his own ; their husbands were ready to pursue a line of conduct similar to that which had cut short the 'squire's life ; and in consequence, the whole reversionary interests x 2"], [778, "308 KEA were soon dissipated, with the exception of one subdivided portion, transmitted by a sister's daughter, who died early in life, to her only daughter, Mary Ann Jenkins, of whom it may be sufficient to say, that if the whole estate had de volved on her, it would have been in hands worthy of her best ancestors. On the banks of the river, directly opposite to Tregoth nan, the magnificent seat of Lord Falmouth, is a farm called Trelease, belonging to the Editor ; for beauty of natural situation and for command of prospect, scarcely in ferior to Tregothnan itself. But if ancient romances could be relied on as authori ties, the place most deserving of regard in this parish, or in the whole county, after Tintagell Castle, would be Carlian, since Thomas of Erceldowne, the celebrated northern poet of the twelfth century, universally known by the appellation of Thomas the Rhymer, describes Carlian as the birth-place of the renowned Sir Tristrem, Knight of the Round Table, companion of Arthur and the chief hero of chivalry, where all exceed not merely the prowess, but whatever the imagination can create in these degene rate times. Yet perhaps the armies and fleets of England may say, Taccia Argo i Mini, e taccio Artu che suoi Enanci, the di sogni empion le carte. Chase Water is now grown almost into a town.

The southern part of Kea is formed of the same rock as the adjoining parish of Feock ; the northern part runs towards the granite, and is similar to the corresponding part of Gwennap ; and, like it, has been much explored by mines.

The Bray's arms were, in a field Argent, a chevron between three eagles' legs erased at the knees Sable. He gave also in a field Varry Purple and Argent, three bend lets Gules. Sir Reginald Bray, Knight Banneret and of the Gar ter, Privy Councillor to King Henry VII. and Speaker of the House of Commons in his eleventh year, is noted to have made the usual protestation for himself to that King, without any petition for the liberty of the Commons, as is to be seen in modus tenendi Parliamentum : he was a brother of the Lord Bray, or descended from the same family. (See Camden in Hampshire.) Others will not allow those Brays to be of British, but of French de scent, from the province of Bray in that country, and that they came into England with the Conqueror, and that the many places in Cornwall distinguished by the name of Bray were denominated from them after their coming into Eng land : but of this query. A Knight Banneret was made in the field or camp of war, under the King's standard, who was per sonally present, by cutting off the point of his standard, and making it a banner ; after which they might display their particular arms in a banner in the King's army, and take place of Knights Bachelors. TONKIN. As for the name of this parish, which is a daughter church to South Hill, and has for its patron saint St. Ni cholas, Bishop of Myra in Lycia, I take it to be Killy- Ton, the town in a grove of trees. Then follows a long conjectural account of the lords of this manor, which is wholly uninteresting, and there fore omitted."], [782, "312 KELLINGTON, OR CALLINGTON. THE EDITOR. Mr. Tonkin does not state on what authority he has assigned the town and parish to the care of St. Nicholas. The popularity of this saint is now, and always has been, so great as to render the fact of his being the patron very probable. He is held in the highest veneration throughout Russia. St. Nicholas ran through the ordinary course of those days. He became a monk, succeeded to the abbacy of his convent ; and when the clergy of Myra assembled to elect a Bishop, and almost agreed in their choice, they were divinely instructed to wait till the next day, and then to choose the person who first offered himself to their notice, on their opening the church-door. They obeyed ; and in the morning St. Nicholas was led to the spot by an irre sistible impulse. He assisted in overthowing the Arians, under the direction of Constantine, at the Council of Nice. All these, however, were matters of frequent occurrence. The fame of St. Nicholas rests on something more unusual; and if the tale is of a date sufficiently early, it may have been the cause of his subsequent advancement, and of his having obtained an influence so great as to effect the change of his simple bishoprick into a metropolitan see, with thirty-six suffragans. So very early was the pr\u0153cox ingenium of this saint di rected towards observances, then deemed most acceptable to the Divinity, that when an infant in arms he rigidly ab stained, every Wednesday and Friday, and on all other days kept as fasts by the church, from touching his nurse's breast; for this truly wonderful ascetic achievement he has been deservedly accounted the peculiar patron of children, and more especially the preserver of their health. He died in 342, and was buried in the Cathedral at Myra; but in the year 1087 his relics were forcibly taken from a country no longer Christian, and were enshrined"], [783, "KELLINGTON, OR CALLINGTON. 313 in the Cathedral of St. Stephen at Bavi in Italy, where pilgrims have ever since resorted in great numbers to wit ness or to experience miraculous cures effected by his in tercession with Almighty God. His festival is kept on the 6th of December, and on this day the ludicrous or profane ceremony of the Boy Bishop used to be exhibited in most Cathedrals. At Salisbury a boy is represented on a monument, dressed in the habit of a bishop including the mitre; and this is said to have been occasioned by the lad dying in his mock pontificate. Mr. Lysons states, that the manor of Callington has passed through various families, Ferrers, Champernowne, WiUoughby, Dennis, and Rolle. The heiress of Samuel Rolle brought it to Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, son of Sir Robert Walpole ; and on the death of his son George Walpole in 1791, sine prole, this property passed to Mr. Robert George William Trefusis, of Trefusis in Cornwall, together with the barony of Clinton, created by writ of summons to Par liament in the reign of Edward the First. George Walpole, Earl of Orford, executed a deed by which, after reserving a life interest to himself, and a power of revocation never acted on, he settled the re mainder in fee of all such property as came to him from his maternal relations, on the right heir of Samuel Rolle, son of Robert Rolle and Arabella Clinton, his ancestor, from whom the Barony had descended ; but his legal ad viser forgot a most important distinction between deeds and wills; a will not coming into action till after the tes tator's death, when Mr. Trefusis would have been the undoubted heir of Samuel Bolle ; but the deed, being effective from the instant of its execution, vested the remainder in Mr. George Walpole himself, the then heir of Samuel Rolle; and on his decease carried the property which had vested in him by act of law, although in direct opposition to his wishes and intention, from the"], [784, "314 KELLINGTON, OR CALLINGTON. maternal line to that of his father. Fortunately, however, in this instance, the whole was under mortgage, which brought the cognizance of the affair into Chancery. Mr. Trefusis took possession unopposed ; and proceedings to obtain the property in consequence of the mistake, were not commenced till after twenty years, when a solemn decision of the House of Lords declared that the inter- ference came too late for disturbing matters in equity. It is obvious that Mr. George Walpole should have set- tled the remainder in fee on such person as would be the heir of Samuel Rolle after his own decease, or perhaps in trustees for such person. Mr. Trefusis (Lord Clinton) has since disposed of the Callington property to Air. Alex- ander Baring. This town or village received a Tudor charter in the 27th vear of Queen Elizabeth, and continued to fulfil the duties, for which the corporation was instituted, till 1832, when the privilege of sending Members to Parlia- ment ceased to exist.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The north-eastern part of this parish extends to the foot of Kitt Hill, the most elevated point in Hingston Down, which is composed of granite. The slate adjoining thereto resembles that which occurs in similar situations in the parishes of St. Austell and St. Blazey ; and it has also been the scene of mining speculations. As the town of Callington is approached, the slate becomes of a darker"], [785, "KENWYN. 315 blue, and passes into hornblende rock, which prevails in the other parts of this parish ; but where quartz predomi nates, the land is barren. This rock, however, does not possess here a very marked character, nor is it frequently exposed to view ; near St. Eve it appears to graduate into the calcareous series. KENWYN. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Powdre, and hath upon the north Peran Sabulo, and St. Allen, east St. Clement's, south Truro, west Kea. In the Domesday tax 20 William I. 1087, this district was rated under the jurisdiction of Edles. In the Inquisi tion of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish benefices, 1294, there is no such church as Kenwen named then in the hundred of Powdre ; if it were then extant, at that time it had no endowment; however, I find in the 15th granted by the Clergy, the 24th Henry VI. 1447, the parish of Kenwen in Powdre was rated 21. 19s.; in Wolsey's Inquisition, 1521, Landegge or Keyewis con solidated into Kenwen (the elder church into the younger) and rated as aforesaid 16/.

Near Edles, or Ideless, i. e. narrow breadth (formerly the voke lands of a considerable manor, taxed in Domes day Book as aforesaid, privileged then with the jurisdic tion of a Court Leet) is yet to be seen the ruins and down falls of St. Clare's consecrated and walled well ; chapelwise built, by the Nuns of the nunnery-house of Poor Clares in Trurow, called An-hell, i. e. the hall ; but yet, alas ! as tra-"], [786, "316 KENWYN. dition saith, they were not so poor as their rule obligeth them to be, for in the walls of this well they had deposited or hid away considerable sums of money, which, by tradi tion or some dream, was discovered tempore James II. to some of the inhabitants of this parish, who one night pulled down the walls and totally defaced this chapel-well in quest thereof, and probably succeeded in their design and under taking, for soon after some poor labourers in agriculture became rich farmers and landed men, and others. From this place was denominated a family of gentlemen, surnamed de Idless, whose heir was married to Hamley, tempore Edward III. Trega-veth-an, in this parish, the grave town or dwell ing, so called from the cemetery and free chapel yet extant here, of public use before the church of Kenwen was erected; which barton and manor for several descents was the lands of a Welch family of gentlemen surnamed de Langhairons; i. e. holy or sacred laws; till the latter end of the reign of King Charles II. when Mr. Langhairne sold this barton to Walter Vincent, Esq., barrister at law, and the manor to Mr. Bawden and others. The arms of Langhairne were Azure, a chevron between three escallops Or. Chyn-coos in this parish, i. e. the wood-house, formerly surrounded with woods, is the dwelling of Thomas Hawes, Gent., that married Hawes of Kea, and Paynter; and giveth the same arms as the Hawses of Kea. TONKIN. The manor of Tregavethan. This signifies the dwelling in the meadows, vethen being the same with hither, a meadow; and whoever sees the place will be soon convinced of the truth of this etymology. Tregedick was lord of the manor and sometimes dwelt here, but having only one daughter and heir, the barton passed with her to \u2014 Langhairne, Esq., but the father having"], [787, "317 KENWYN. reserved the manor, he in consequence of some difference sold it. The Langhairnes, however, continued to reside on the barton in much esteem till the great Civil Wars, in which this family suffered so much as to be compelled to sell it; and it came at last into the possession of Henry Vincent, Gent., of Tresinsple, who let out the barton in leases to several tenants, so that it is now become a village, and little of the mansion or house left standing. To the west of Tregavethan, or the high town, on the confines between this parish and those of St. Agnes and Perran in the Sands, are three great barrows, called the Three Barrows; and about a mile to the westward of these on very high ground are four barrows, one belonging to this manor and the other three to Lambourn in Perran. These barrows give name to the downs, and the great road from London to the Land's End passes between them. They were doubtless the burying places of some principal com manders, and probably Danes. To the left of Tregavethan and within the manor, is Roseworth, the Green Valley. This was once a seat of the family of Cosens ; and here lived Nicholas Cosens, Esq. who was Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1660. He dying without issue left it to his widow, and after his death it became the property of Samuel Enys, Esq. by purchase. THE EDITOR. Kenwyn may be said to include the old part of Truro, which occupies the mere extremity of a point or tongue of land stretching from this parish and enclosed between two rivers. The land immediately round the town is fertile, in a high state of cultivation, and decorated by trees and vil las ; but towards the Four Barrow Down and Chasewater, nothino- can be more desolate than the barren commons studded with heaps of rubbish from deserted mines. In this parish are situate two of the earliest establish ments for smelting tin by means of coal, and on the largest scale of any in the county, Calenick and Cavedras ; but"], [788, "318 KENWYN. of late years this business has taken an entirely new cha racter ; tin ores are sold, like those of copper, by public tender or ticketings, and smelting houses are constructed in some cases for the use of particular mines. The manor of Newham formed part of the Bodregan property, and after the despoiling of Sir Henry Bodregan by King Henry VII. it was given to Trevanion, of whom it was purchased by the late Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell, sometime member for West Looe, by whom a handsome house has been built on the side of the river, half a mile below Truro ; Bosvigo is also a gentleman's seat. And at Comprigney, near Bosvigo, the Editor appre hends that several ancestors in succession of General Sir Hussey Vivian resided. Kenwyn church and tower, with an excellent glebe house adjacent, built about the year 1780, are very conspicuous objects, and command themselves a fine view of the town and river. The church is provided with a set of bells said to surpass all others in the country; and to have been placed there when ringing was a favourite amusement with the neighbouring gentlemen.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. This large parish does not appear to offer anything peculiar in its geology, as Doctor Boase merely remarks that Kenwyn lies entirely on slate, which is of the same nature as that of St. Allen and St. Clement's."], [789, "319 ST. KEVERNE. ST. KEVERNE. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the north St. Martin's, east St. Anthony, west Ruan Minor, south the British Channel.

Note further, that as ker, kerr, kyr, kir, signifies dear, beloved, choicely affectioned, in British, Cornish, and the Armorick languages, answerable to dilectus in Latin ; so from thence proceeds Kerryer, a lover, or one dearly affectioned. See Floyd upon dilectus. Tre-land in this parish (either the temple town, or a town notable for land) was another district or manor, taxed in Domesday Roll ; and I take it, there are yet extant two tenements here called Tre-land Vear, and Tre-land Vean ; i. e. the greater and less Tre-lands. One of those places, as I am informed, is the dwelling of John Hayme, Gent. (Saxon, i. e. a house, home, or covering; see also Verstegan upon this word) that married Tregose; his father Boggans. In this parish is situate Condura and Tregarne, manors formerly pertaining to Condura, Earl of Cornwall. Lanareh, also Lan-arth, in this parish is the dwelling of Sampson Sanns, Gent., that married Cood, which tene ment or barton was formerly the lands of Kensham, who sold it to the present possessors. This Mr. Sanns died without legal issue about the year 1696, and left his estate to his brother's son, John Sanns, that married Hamley of St. Neot, now in possession thereof, who in the month of January, in the afternoon, in the year 1702, with seven other persons, men and women of this parish, coming by sea from Falmouth town and harbour towards their own homes in a fishing boat of about five tons burden, without deck or covering, on a fair day ; and having got off at sea about a league beyond the said harbour, and within two leagues of their dwelling to the west ; sud-"], [791, "ST. KEVERNE. 321 denly there happened to arise a high and mighty storm of wind against them, which rose the rapid waves of the sea to that degree, that the boatmen or oarmen, with all their skill or strength, were not able to put the boat further forward without its being filled with water or swallowed up with the raging sea. Whereupon, despairing of getting home to St. Keverne, they all resolved if possible to return back to Falmouth harbour before this tempestuous storm of wind that blew that way, or to run on shore on any other part of the country as they could. But, alas ! they no sooner at tempted those expedients, and turned their boat, but instantly the wind turned and thwarted their design. In this extremity they knew not what to do ; both wind and water being thus outrageous against them : and that which added more to their calamity was, that, through their long toiling at sea, the light of the sun was past and night approached. Then every person present being at their wit's end, called upon his God for pardon of their sins, and mercy upon their souls, as despairing of the preservation of their bodies from the merciless element of the seas; when at length, after much fervent prayers, tears, and cries, the watermen proposed, all other their endeavours failing, that the boat must be left to drive before the wind and sea, to such port or place as God in his infinite mercy and pro vidence should guide it. This course was taken, and the boat forthwith, by letting loose its helm, in a dark long night and most tremendous storm or hurricane, followed the current of the wind and waves all night ; the passengers every minute casting out of the boat such water as the outrageous seas cast in upon her, least she might thereby be overwhelmed or filled therewith. At length the glimpse of daylight appeared, when they beheld themselves environed with the billows of the great ocean, without sight of either sun, moon, stars, or land. The storm still continuing all that day and the night after, VOL. II. Y"], [792, "322 ST. KEVERNE. also the third day and the night after, the boat and mariners in the same condition as aforesaid, when afterwards the fourth day in the morning, the wind and seas being some what abated of their fury and violence, about ten of the clock they discovered land, and forthwith rowed and steered the boat to the sea-shore thereof, where they arrived with the boat safely ; which happened to be, as I was informed, on the coast of Normandy in France, about a hundred leagues distance from the place the boat first was driven off at sea. Which happened to be at such time as Queen Anne had wars with the French King. As soon as Mr. Sanns and his companions stept on land, they were met by three or four men with fusees, demanding what they were (as they judged, for they understood not French), to which they replied they were English; which one of them that understood the English tongue hearing, demanded the occasion of their coming there, and by what expedient they came over ; the particulars of which hearing, as aforesaid, they were all astonished to hear of their hazardous passage, miraculous preservation, and to behold the boat, the instrument thereof next Providence. Upon which discourse, a gentleman of the company asked Mr. Sanns what part of England he was born in, to which he replied Cornwall ; and further interrogated him whether his name were not Sanns, to which he replied that it was ; ' Why then,' said the gentleman, ' I know your per son, and well remember the kindness you shewed me in my distressmany years since at your house, when the ship in which I was, was cast away and lost on the coast of St. Kevern ; ' understanding which, after they embraced each other. Then, he demanded their arms and money, if any ; whereupon Mr. Sanns having with him forty guineas that he had received at Falmouth for pilchards, the day before his boat was driven off at sea, he forthwith delivered it to his friend, who told him he and his companions must yield themselves prisoners of war; which accordingly they did, and Mr. Sanns was taken home to the gentleman's house. After"], [793, "ST. KEVERNE. 323 which they were all examined concerning the premises before a justice ofthe peace, who finding matters as afore said, ordered that they should not be kept in custody as prisoners of war, but be all permitted to go at liberty and beg the alms of the people ; whereupon they found extra ordinary charity and favour amongst them, since they were not enemies, but persons by fate or Providence, brought there after an especial manner, and preserved from the violence of the seas by the great Maker and Protector of all things. The news whereof forthwith not only flew over the country, but was transmitted to the cognizance of King Lewis XIV., who thereupon ordered that by the first transport ship for prisoners of war, they should all be sent home freely into England ; which happening soon after, Mr. Sanns took his leave of his kind landlord, in whose house he had been dieted and entertained, and was content to leave the forty guineas aforesaid with him, as his recompence; but contrary to his expectation the gentleman gave the same to him again, saying he would take nothing of that kind at his hands, since God in such a wonderful manner had preserved him and his companions from tbe great danger of the seas. Whereupon, he presented five or six guineas to his wife, who after some reluctancy ac- cepted thereof, and so they parted and went on board a transport ship, and safelyr landed at Portsmouth ; and in about eight weeks after their departure from England, returned safe to St. Keverne, to the great joy and astonish- ment of their friends and relations, who concluded them all drowned long before. And that the reader may not think those people's sub sistance three nights and four days in their dangerous sea voyage, was as supernatural as their preservation, it must be remembered, that one of Mr. Sanns' companions being a woman that was an inn- keeper, had bought at Falmouth town before they departed thence, for to sell to her customers, twelve pennyworth of white bread and three y2"], [794, "324 ST.

Matthew of Westminster, our Chrono loger, tells us that about the year 900, Dusblan, Machreu and one Maxlium, in a boat made of one ox skin and a half, with seven days provisions, in two days and a night arrived miraculously into Cornwall from Ireland, at the Mount's Bay. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin does not add any thing to Mr. Hals's nar rative, except the single observation, It takes its name from the famous St. Keven THE EDITOR. St. Keverne's fame does not extend out of Cornwall. He must have been one of the Irish missionaries who crossed the seas in granite troughs, or in skiffs made of bullocks' hides. Tales were in circulation about mutual visits from St. Perran and St. Kevern, but they contain only vulgar incidents of modern fabrication. The extraordinary escape of the passengers from Fal mouth, is retained at the full length in which Mr. Hals relates it, as the narrative bears evident marks of authen ticity, and tbe incidents are creditable to all the parties introduced. This parish is amply provided with small harbours or coves affording shelter to boats, and the shore admits of using seine nets for taking pilchards. The principal of these harbours, Coverack, has been long noted for an extensive trade, still more lucrative than fishing ; the other two are Porthoustock (Proustock) and Porthalla (Praia). About seventy years since a large shoal of pilchards came into the cove at Porthoustock, while the seine boats were on the outside. One of these extended its net across the entrance and shut in the whole ; but salt in sufficient quan-"], [795, "325 ST. KEVERNE. tity could not be procured for saving them, when the fishermen resolved on the hazardous expedient of sailing to France for a supply; the weather continued fine till their return, and they are reported to have prepared for exportation above a thousand hogsheads. The Church is situated on the highest ground in this whole district, having the addition of a spire instead of the lofty tower usual in Cornwall. The existing spire is of recent date, although probably on the model of that which was destroyed by lightning on the 28th of February 1770. For a very accurate and able account of this thunder storm, which occurred during divine service, and seems to have been one of the most violent on record, see a paper in the 61st vol. of the Philosophical Transactions, p. 71, art. 8, 1771; (and vol. 13, p. 98, of the Abridgment,) by the Rev. Anthony Williams, then Vicar. The spire was rent in pieces. The roof of the church almost entirely destroyed ; large stones scattered over the floor, and small stones on the outside carried to a distance little short of a quarter of a mile. Mr. Williams himself was rendered insensible, the whole congregation, with very few exceptions, fell on the ground deprived of all recol lection ; but no life was lost, nor did any sustain a serious injury; about ten were slightly hurt. In the church are several monuments ; and in the church yard stands a large sarcophagus, having sculptured on it the representation of a shipwreck, and military emblems, with the following inscription. To the memory of Major-General H. G. C Cavendish, Capt. S. C. Duckenfield, Lieut, the Hon. E. Waldegrave, Sixty-one non-commissioned officers and privates of the regiment, who in returning from Spain in the Despatch transport unhappily perished in Coverack Cove, the 22nd of December 1809."], [796, "326 ST. KEVERNE. The ship was known to be very old and in bad repair ; but, although the wind blew with some violence, it would have been a matter of no difficulty whatever to clear the Mein Egles, or Manacles Rocks. Seamen have therefore O t conjectured that the Captain kept near the shore for the purpose of stranding his vessel, to obtain the exaggerated value contracted for with the Government; and that in attempting this fraud, he fell on the rocks which caused the loss of every one on board. Mr. Cavendish was a son of Lord George Cavendish, of East Bourn, Sussex, afterwards created Earl of Burlington. The great tithes of this parish have been sold to the va rious proprietors of the land. The tithes of fish belonged, however, to Mr. Matthew Wills of Helston, in right of his marriage with the only daughter of Mr. Tonkin of Trenance near Porthoustock. For some years they were of considerable value, but as all tithe of fish is allowed to be in this country the mere creature of custom, the custom then acted on was attacked at law, and after a trial, on which the celebrated Mr. Dun ning attended by a special retainer, it was overturned. Trenance and the other property in St. Kevern are now pos sessed by his son, the Rev. Thomas Wills, Vicar of Wen dron, for about fifty years. Kilter, in this parish, was the birthplace and probably belonged to the individual of that name, who with Humphry Arundell and others, excited the common people to take arms against the government of King Edward VI. in 1549, by holding out those unattainable objects which have misled ihe ignorant to their own destruction in all a^es and nations, in union with others certainly of a different description ; one of which was the re-establishment of the Bloody Statute, or the Six Articles, by which every person refusing to acknowledge the King's supremacy over the church was adjudged to be hanged; and every one con scientiously disbelieving the real presence of Christ's body in consecrated bread and wine, was condemned to be burnt alive."], [797, "ST. KEVERNE. 327 Lanarth has been for a considerable time the residence of the Sandys family. The Rev. Sampson Sandys lived there to a very advanced age. He was probably grandson to the gentleman whose wonderful escape to the coast of France is detailed by Mr. Hals under the name of Sanns, which the editor remembers to have heard was the orioinal appellation of their family, till they adopted the name and cross-crosslets of the Sandys of Ombersley. Mr. Sampson Sandys was succeeded at Lanarth by his nephew, Mr. William Sandys, a colonel in the army of the East India Company, who rebuilt the house, and greatly improved the place. The rectory was, before the Reformation, appropriated to the Abbey of Beaulieu in Hampshire, founded by King John.

KEVERNE. 329 pressed them through the medium of his officers, the Abbats of the said order came to a Parliament which the King held at Lincoln, to try if they might be able by some means to obtain a small share of the King's grace and favour. But when the King saw them, he became so cruelly disposed towards them, as to order that the said Abbats should, in the most disgustful manner, be trodden under the horses' feet; but his people being unwilling to execute a command so unjust, so atrocious, and hitherto unheard of from any Christian prince, those Lord Abbats, now despairing of any kindness on the part of the King, hastily retired to their hostels. But in the following night, as the said King John lay sleeping on his bed, it seemed to him that he was brought before some judge, these Abbats stand ing by, whom the judge ordered to scourge him on the back with whips and rods ; and when the King awoke in the morning, he declared that he actually felt the scourging. Having related his dream to a certain ecclesiastic of his court, this person assured him that God had been merciful to him beyond measure, by deigning thus kindly and pater nally to correct him in this present life, and by revealing to him his mysteries ,\u2022 and he advised the King to send imme diately for the Abbats of this order, and humbly to implore from them the pardon of his offence. \" The King consenting, a message was sent to them that they should come to the King ; which hearing from the messenger, thought that they should be banished from England : but God, who never deserts his servants, dis posed things otherwise ; so that when they came into the King's presence, he put away the anger which he had en tertained against them.\" There is not any trace of the advowson of the vicarage having belonged to this splendid abbey, which afforded sanctuary to Queen Margaret and Perkin Warbeck.

There are few spots that have excited greater geological interest than the serpentine tract of the Lizard, and no part of it will be found more instructive than this parish. By far the greater part of St. Kevern rests on magnesian rocks ; but north of a line drawn from Porthalla, nearly due west to Goonhilly Downs, the rocks belong to the calca reous series. The latter rocks may be seen on the coast from Porthalla to the Nare Point, and will be found to resemble the series between Gorran and the Dodman Point. On the left side of Porthalla Cove the blue slate abounds in veins and in irregular nodules of calcspar; and at low- water-mark a more compact variety is exposed, which evidently forms the passage into the black limestone, loose fragments of which are sometimes found on the shore. In a small creek within the Nare near Bostowda, is a large patch of conglomerate, the pebbles and fragments of which have been derived from the rocks which \u2022 line the banks of the river Hellas as high up as Gweek; but which bear no resemblance to the rock of the immediate vicinity. This is the most decided instance of a fragmentary rock in Corn wall. The hollow occupied by the little stream which dis charges itself at Porthalla divides the calcareous shale from a rock of totally different nature, videlicet serpentine,"], [801, "331 ST. KEVERNE. several varieties of which form the neck of land stretching thence to Dranna Point. At Porthoustock a glossy lamellar rock, already noticed as joining the serpentine at Cadgwith, forms each side of the cove ; but here, on proceeding to the Manacles Point it may be seen passing into diallage rock : the latter extends so far as Coverack, and also inland to the foot of Goonhilly Downs. At Coverack the diallage rock appears to pass into serpentine ; but here again, as at Porthalla, the junc tion is a concrete. The varieties of serpentine near Coverack Pier are numerous, and several of them may be seen passing into each other, which in other parts of the Lizard district form large and apparently independent masses. From Coverack to Kennick Cove the cliffs are very bold, and display different kinds of serpentine and diallage rocks, and at Blockhead a large stratum of indu rated steatite, beautifully marked with brown arborescent figures on a yellow ground. At Kennick Cove, red and olive green serpentine, abounding in scales of diallage, and traversed by numerous veins of asbestos, talc, and calcare ous spar, are exposed to view on a grand scale ; and at Gwinter, a little north of the cove, diallage rock is accom panied by layers of beautiful violet-coloured jade, or com pact felspar, containing large plates of diallage as metalloide as at Coverack. It may be noticed here, that all the uncultivated land extending over serpentine formation, is clothed with the most beautiful of European heaths ; the Erica Vagans of Linn\u00e6us, so named on account of its being found in various parts of the world on particular spots. Hudson named it \" Multiflora \" from its splendid inflorescense ; and Dr. Wi thering, with some others, didyma, with reference to double anther\u00e6 on each flower. This heath bounds itself almost within a yard to the limits of the magnesian earths."], [802, "332 ST. KEW. ST. KEW. HALS.

Now it happened, tempore Charles I., that Sir Bevill Grenvill, being much encumbered with the debts of his ances tors, in order to free the same, sold for a valuable considera tion this manor of Lanow and barton of Bryn to William"], [803, "333 ST. KEW Noye, Esq. Attorney-general to King Charles I. the which William Noyeandhisheirsquietly enjoyed the same for about thirty years' space, till King Charles II. returned from his exile beyond the seas, and was restored to his dominions 1660; at which time Sir John Grenvill, Knt. afterwards created Earl of Bath, (son of the said Sir Bevill Grenvill) then also in exile with the said King beyond the seas, came back to his native country with the said King ; and some time after delivered leases of ejectment, on writs of ejec tion, firme formedon, or right, to the tenants of Hum phrey Noye, Esq. then in possession thereof, son of the said Attorney-general Noye, and brought down a venire facias and trial for the same, at Lanceston assizes, where, on the issue, the verdict passed for the said Earl of Bath ; and after judgment was entered up and recorded thereupon, writs for possession were sued forth, and his lordship be came seised of those lands, and forced the tenants thereof to double their accustomed rent, on condition of holding their leases. Afterwards Noye's son aforesaid, files his bill in chancery, suggesting the wrong he had received by this verdict at law, whereby he lost his lands and purchase money, which matter coming to a hearing on bill and an swer, an issue was directed out of Chancery to try once more this title at common law, on which Noye proved Sir Beavill Grenvill to be tenant in tail for those lands, and that he levying a fine thereon, come ceo qui il eit de son done, according to due form of law, with deeds declaring the same to be for the use of the said William Noye, his heirs and assigns for ever, that was a sufficient dock of the entail, and bar to the son and heir of the said Sir Beavill Grenvill, whereupon the sense and judgment of the Court then was, that according to law the verdict must be for Noye: as accordingly it then passed. Notwithstanding which, a cross bill was filed by the Earl of Bath against Noye, about the premises, praying a writ of injunction for stopping further proceedings at common law ; whereupon his lordship still kept possession, and Noye grew weary of"], [804, "334 ST. KEW this controversy, who, otherwise, was a man much depressed with debt, and therefore an unequal contester with the then great Earl of Bath ; wherefore he sold his title to those lands in dispute to Mr. Christopher Davies, of Burnewall in Buryan, who revived Noye's drooping case and title to the premises, and delivered ejectments to the Earl of Bath's tenants, then in possession thereof, and accordingly brought down a trial at Lanceston upon that plea and de- mise, tempore James II., when it was manifest his lordship relied more on his privilege as a Peer or Baron of this Realm than the right or justice of the merits of his case, for he served all the council, officers, and attornies of the court at that assizes with writs of privilege ; so that no per- son was permitted to speak or act publicly on the part or title of Noye or Davies ; but the case or trial was immerged or was swallowed up without due course or form of law, so that Mr. Davies was only permitted to plead his case him self, which he did with so much judgment, sense, law, and equity, as the Court admired at it, being no lawyer. But, alas ! he wanted instruction in the grand point in such cases, to have cried out a merger or emerger, and the verdict must have been for him or Noye the second time. After which bad success, and for that Mr. Davies was threatened to be sued on the statute of scandalum magna tum, for words said to be spoken by him reflective on his lordship's honour and reputation, he was terrified into a composition or agreement with the said Earl, by the end of Hilary term then next ensuing, for the consideration of 500/. to levy a fine sur cognizance de droit, with proclama tion on those lands, with deeds declaring the uses thereof to be only to the proper use and behoof of the said Earl of Bath, his heirs and assigns for ever, as accordingly was performed, and so this controversy ended.

Bo-Kelly in this parish was the dwelling of the genteel family surnamed Carn-sew, i. e. dry, sterile, or barren spar stone, or rock ; perhaps so called from the local place of Carnsew in Mabe, altogether under such circumstances; otherwise Mr. Carew tells us the name of those gentlemen was Carn-deaw, i. e. black spar-stone or rock. William Carnsew of this house was sheriff of Cornwall 18 Ed ward IV.; William Carnsew was Sheriff of Cornwall 3 Henry VIII. Richard Carnsew, Esq. afterwards knighted, was Sheriff of Cornwall 17 Charles I. 1642, whose heir George Carn sew, as I am told, sold it to Tregagle, and is now by lease in possession of John Nicholls, of Trewane, Esq.

Tre-havar-ike, alias Tre-ar-ike, gave name and origi nal to an old family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed de Trehauarike, whose sole inheritrix was married to Cavall, tempore Henry VII. who, out of a supposed allu sion to this name, as appears from the glass windows of this house, gave a calf for their arms, viz. Argent, a calf passant Gules; whereas Leugh is a calf in British-Cornish, and Cavall is a bee-hive, cradle, or flasket. They gave also, Azure, three sails of a ship Argent ; for that, as tradi tion saith, one of this family was admiral of a squadron of ships at sea, under King Henry VI. against the French ; finally, about the year 1612, the two sole daughters and heirs of those Cavalls were married to Vivian, of Trenowth in St. Colomb, and Hore of Trenowth in St. Ewan. Upon the division of Cavall's lands, this barton and manor fell to Vivian's share, whose grandson Thomas Vivian, Esq."], [806, "336 ST.

By the inquisition 12 Edward III. it was rated for twenty-one Cornish acres, before the judges Solomon de Ross and others, at Lanceston, that is to say, 1260 statute acres. I take the tenure of this manor to be either customary or copyhold lands ; near which is still ex tant Chappell Amble, or Ambhull, i. e. the dull, blockish, or ignorant chapel or chaplain, a free chapel, where the Bishop never visited.

If Saint Kebius is really the patron of this parish, and has given it his name somewhat disguised in the sound of St. Kew, he has the unusual felicity of being honoured in his own country. Doctor Borlase states, on the authority of Archbishop Usher, (Antiquities of Cornwall, 2d ed. p. 369.) \" About the middle of the fourth century, Solomon Duke of Cornwall seems to have been a Christian ; for his son Kebius was ordained a Bishop by Hilarius, Bishop of Poic tiers, in France; and afterwards returned into his own country to exercise that high function.\" Saint Kebius, however, stands in the Roman Calendar on the 26th of April ; but the parish feast is kept (I be lieve) on the nearest Sunday to the 25th of July, the day of Saint James the Apostle.

Sir Richard Gurnard or Gurney was then parish priest of Bideford, who it seems was admonished in his sleep to undertake this work, as Bishop Bronscomb was to build Glasney College in Cornwall ; the Goldneys, Octanetts, and most other families of note in Cornwall and Devon (as Risdon's Manu script informs us) were benefactors to this work, which bridge was finished tempore Richard II., assisted by a bull of indulgencies from Rome.

Of his father, Sir Richard Grenvill, the elder, thus speaks Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, \" he interlaced his home magistracy with martial employments abroad, whereof the King testified his good liking by his liberality.\" Again, his son, the second Sir Richard, after his travel and following the wars under the Emperor Maximilian against the Turks, for which his name is recorded by sundry foreign writers, and his undertaking to people Virginia and Ireland, made so glorious a conclusion in her Majesty's ship the Revenge, of which he had charge as Captain, and of the whole fleet as Vice-Admiral, that it seemed thereby, when he found none other to compare withal in his life, he strived through a virtuous envy to exceed it in his death ; a victorious loss for the realm, and of which the Spaniard may say, with Pyrrhus, that many such conquests would beget his utter overthrow.

Richard de Grenville, who came over with William the Conqueror, is said in the pedigrees of tlJ^family to have been a younger brother of Robert Fit\u00c6iamon, Earl of Carbill, Lord of Thurigny and Gren ville, in France and Normandy, and to have been lineally descended from Rollo, Duke of Normandy. It is on re cord that Richard de Grenville held certain knights' fees at Bideford, in Devonshire, in the reign of Henry II. We have not found any record of the Grenville possessions at Kilkhampton of an earlier date than the quo warranto roll before mentioned ; but it appears that it had at that time been long in the family : they continued to reside at Stowe, in this parish, for many generations, and frequently served the office of sheriff for the county. William Grenville, or Grenfield (as the name was at that early period generally written), son of Sir Theobald, became archbishop of York, and distinguished himself as an able statesman : he died in 1315. Sir Richard Grenville, son of Roger, (who was himself a captain in the navy, and lost his life, as Carew tells us, in the unfortunate Mary-Rose) was a celebrated military and naval commander in the reign of Queen Eli zabeth. He first distinguished himself in the wars under the Emperor Maximilian against the Turks, for which his name is recorded by several foreign writers. In the year 1591, being then Vice-Admiral of England, he was sent in the Revenge, with a squadron of seven ships, to intercept the Spanish galleons ; when, falling in with the enemy's fleet, consisting of fifty-two sail, near the Terceira Islands, he repulsed them fifteen times in- a continued fight, till his powder was all spent ; his ship, which sunk before it arrived in port, was reduced to a hulk, and himself covered with wounds, of which he died two days afterwards, on board the vessel of the Spanish commander. Sir Richard's \u00b0rand son was the brave aqd loyal Sir Beville Grenville. This distinguished officer was one of king Charles's generals in V to"], [815, "KILKHAMPTON. 345 the West, and shared the glories of the successful compaign in Cornwall, in the autumn of 1642; in the summer ofthe following year he lost his life at the battle of Lansdowne, near Bath. Sir Richard Grenville, who had been created a Baronet in 1631, was, after his brother's death, made General of all the King's forces in the WTest. He was an active and zealous officer, and so particularly obnoxious to the Parliamentary party, that he was perpetually the sub- ject of abuse to their journalists, who seldom spoke of him but by the appellation of Shellum Grenville. During the dissensions between the civil power and the military in 1645, Sir Richard Grenville was superseded and impri- soned by the advice of Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon. That noble author gives a very unamiable character of Sir Richard, who is represented as having been in the highest degree oppressive, tyrannical, and un- principled ; but other writers attribute much of this to the personal enmity which subsisted between them. Sir Rich- ard Grenville died, in reduced circumstances, at Ghent, in the year 1658, leaving no male issue ; the title became ex- tinct. Sir John Grenville, son of the brave Sir Beville, succeeded to the Kilkhampton estates : at a very early age he had a command in his father's regiment, and was left for dead in the field at Tewkesbury. He was appointed Go- vernor of Scilly Islands when they revolted from the Par- liament, and was one of the chief instruments in effecting the restoration of King Charles II. He gave the living of Kilkhampton to Nicholas Monk, and employed him to in- fluence his brother (the General) in favour of the exiled Monarch ; having succeeded in his negociations, he had the satisfaction of being the bearer of the King's letters to General Monk and to the Parliament. In April 1661 Sir John Grenville was created Lord Grenville of Kilk hampton and Bideford, Viscount Lansdowne, and Earl of Bath. On the death of his grandson, under age,. in 1711, these titles became extinct ; and the Kdkhampton estates"], [816, "346 KILKHAMPTON. passed to his aunt and coheiress Grace Grenville, who married George Lord Carteret, and was afterwards (being then a widow) by King George the First created Countess of Granville, with remainder to her son John, who inhe rited that title and the Kilkhampton estate. On the death of Robert the second Earl of Granville, in 1776, that title became extinct, and the Kilkhampton estate passed, under his will, to his nephew Henry Frederick Thynne, second son of Lord Viscount Weymouth, who had married his sister Louisa. Mr. Thynne was created Lord Carteret in 1784, and is the present possessor of Kilkhampton ; the remainder of which, as well as the title of Carteret, is vested in Lord George Thynne, second son of the Marquis of Bath. John Grenville, Earl of Bath, in the reign of Charles II. built a magnificient mansion at Stowe in this parish, of which scarcely a vestige remains. It stood on an eminence, overlooking a well-wooded valley ; but not a tree near it, says Dr. Borlase, to shelter it from the north-west. That writer speaks of it as by far the noblest house in the west of England, and says that the kitchen-offices, fitted up for a dwelling-house, made no contemptible figure. It is a sin gular circumstance, that the cedar wainscot which had been brought out of a Spanish prize, and used by the Earl of Bath for fitting up the chapel in this mansion, was pur chased by Lord Cobham at the time of its demolition (the house being then sold piecemeal), and applied to the same purpose at Stowe, the magnificent seat of the noble family of Grenville in Buckinghamshire, where it still remains.

The last of the Westlakes died in very indigent circum stances about the year 1772, having been reduced to the situation of a parish pauper. It is a singular circum stance, that he was twice pricked for Sheriff after he was an inhabitant of the poor-house. In the parish church are monuments of the Grenville family, and memorials of the Orchards of Alderscombe, the Westlakes of Elmsworthy, and the Waddons of Tonacombe in Morwinstow. On the monument of Sir Beville Grenville, which is surrounded by military trophies, is the following inscription : \" Here lyes all that was mortal of the most noble and truly valiant Sir Beville Grenville, of Stowe in the county of Cornwall, Earl of Corbill and Lord of Thorigny and Granville in France and Normandy, descended in a direct line from Robert, second son of the warlike Rollo, first Duke of Normandy; who, after having obtained divers signal victories over the Rebels in the West, was at length slain with many wounds at the battle of Lansdowne July 5, 1643. He married the most virtuous lady, Grace, daughter of Sir George Smith, of the county of Devon, by whom he had many sons, eminent for their loyalty and firm adherence to the Crown and Church; and several daughters, remark able examples of true piety. He was indeed an excellent person, whose activity, interest, and reputation was the foundation of what had been done in Cornwall, and his temper and affection so public that no accident which hap pened could make any impressions on him, and his example kept others from taking any thing ill, or at least seeming to do so ; in a word, a brighter courage and a gentler dispo sition were never married together to make the most cheer ful and innocent conversation. Vide Lord Clarendon's History of the Rebellion."], [818, "348 KILKHAMPTON. \" To the immortal memory of his renowned grandfather this monument was erected by the Right Honorable George Lord Lansdowne, Treasurer of the Household to Queen Anne, and one of Her Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, &c. in the year 1714. \" Thus slain thy valiant ancestor did lye, When his one bark a navy did defy, When now encompass'd round the victor stood, And bath'd his pinnace in his conquering blood, 'Till, all his purple current dried and spent, He fell, and made the waves his monument.

Sir Beville Granville was forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, as appears by the following record of his birth in the parish register at Kilkhampton : \" Bevell, the sonne of the worshipful Bernarde Greyn ville, Esquire, was borne and baptized at Brinn in Corn wall, Ao.

In the registers of the see of Exeter, mention is made of a chapel at Brightley in this parish, dedicated to St. Ca tharine. \u2014 Thus far from Mr. Lysons. All the accounts and traditions of Sir Beville Granville represent him as a hero bordering on romance, as the rival of Sir Philip Sidney, and of Lord Herbert of Cherbury. He fell, however, into all the political errors of that age, by attaching himself to the existing form of Government, not"], [819, "KILKHAMPTON. 349 because it appeared, on the whole, to prove most conducive to human happiness, but from some fanciful, superstitious, or blasphemous analogy it was supposed to bear with the Divine administration of the universe. Then he concurred with those who thought it expedient and right to destroy the resemblance, by limiting that which, on the supposition, should exist without restraint or control ; and entertaining that opinion, he nevertheless endeavoured to prove by argu ments, and still more powerfully by his arms at Stratton and at Bath, that no resistance could in any case be lawfully exercised against the individual who happened to hold the chief magistracy from the accident of his birth. Such glar ing inconsistencies were, however, almost obscured by the splendour of undaunted courage, of disinterested generosity, and, by adherence to principles honestly entertained, how ever erroneous or contradictory. It would be unfair to the memory of Sir Beville Gran ville not to insert his letter to Sir John Trelawny, recently printed in the Memorials of John Hampden, 2 vols. 8vo., by George Grenville Nugent Temple, Lord Nugent, vol. 2, p. 195. Most Honourable Sir, I have in many kinds had trial of your nobleness, but in none more than in this singular expression of your kind care and love. I give also your excellent Lady humble thanks for respect unto my poor Woman, who hath been lono- a faithful much obliged servant of your Ladyes. But Sir ! for my journey, it is fixed. I cannot contain myself within my doors, when the King of England's standard waves in the field upon so just occasion. The cause being such as must make all those that die in it little inferior to martyrs. And for my own part, I desire to acquire an honest name, or an honourable grave. I never loved my life or ease so much as to shun such an oc casion ; which if I should, I were unworthy of the profes sion I have held, or to succeed those ancestors of mine, who have so many of them in several ages sacrificed their"], [820, "350 KILKHAMPTON. lives for their country. Sir, the barbarous and implacable enemy, notwithstanding His Majesty's gracious proceedings with them, do continue their insolences and rebellion in the highest degree, and are united in a body of great strength ; so as you may expect, if they be not prevented and mastered near their own homes, they will be troublesome in yours, and in the remotest places ere long. I am not without the consideration, as you lovingly ad vise, of my wife and family ; and as for her, I must ac knowledge, she hath ever drawn so evenly in the yoke with me, as she hath never prest before, or hung be hind me, nor ever opposed or resisted my will. And yet truly I have not, in this or any thing else, endeavoured to walk in the way of power with her, but of reason ; and though her love will submit to either, yet truly my respect will not suffer me to urge her with power, unless I can con vince with reason. So much for that, whereof I am willing to be accomptable unto so good a friend. I have no suit unto you in mine own behalf, but for your prayers and good wishes ; and that if I live to come home again, you would please to continue me in the number of your servants. I shall give a true relation unto my very noble friend Mr. Moyle, of your and his Aunt's loving respects to him, which he hath good reason to be thankful for. And so I beseech God to send you and your noble family all health and happiness, and while I Jive I am, Sir, Your unfeigned loving and faithful servant, Beville Granville. With the death of Sir Beville Granville, in the moment of victory at Lansdown, the splendour of this family seems to have fallen under a temporary eclipse. His brother is represented by Hyde, the partial histo rian of these civil wars, as unworthy of the character sup posed to distinguish Cavaliers. John Grenville, his eldest son, created Earl of Bath, appears to have been rapacious and oppressive."], [821, "KILKHAMPTON. 351 But all this was amply compensated by the subsequent conduct of his son and heir Charles Grenville, who served with honour in the continental wars, and participated with John Sobieski in the preservation of Christendom under the walls of Vienna in 1683. George Grenville, son of Barnard Grenville, brother to the first Earl of Bath, is known to every one by his lite rary attainments and by his talents for poetry. This gen lteman had the honour of being elected member for the county of Cornwall, with Mr. John Trevanion, after the great contest of 1710, amidst shouts of Grenville aDd Trevanion as sound as a Bell, For the Queen, the Church, and Sacheverel : In the following year an hereditary seat in Parliament was bestowed on him, with the appellation of Lord Lans down, and he was succeeded in the representation of Corn wall by Sir Richard Vyvyan. Lord Lansdown suffered imprisonment after the acces sion of George I. and retired from public life. His ge nuine works in prose and verse were collected in 2 vols. 4to., London 1732. He died, sine prole, in 1734. The old house at Stowe was taken down by John Gren ville the first Earl of Bath, and a superb mansion erected in its place, partly, as it is said, at the national expense ; having the internal decorations suited to the size and magnificence of the exterior ; but soon after the decease of his grandson in 1711, when the property passed into a female line, this house was taken down and the materials of all kinds sold. It used to be said that almost every gentleman's seat in Cornwall had received embellishments from Stowe. Mr. Prideaux' house at Padstow received an entire staircase, and some carved wainscot has, by a singular fate, found its way to Stowe, in Buckinghamshire. Alderscombe, in this parish, was for many years held on lease for lives by the family of Cottell. Mr. Alexander Cottell, about the year 1720, having"], [822, "352 KILKHAMPTON. served his clerkship in Penzance, as an attorney, married Sarah Phillips, one of the daughters of Mr. Samuel Phil lips, of Pendrea. There is a monument to her memory in the church, stating her decease on the 7th of August, 1727, in her thirtieth year, with the arms of Cottell, Or, a bend Gu. This gentleman married again and dissipated his whole property. The church is one ofthe finest in Cornwall, containing splendid monuments ; and under, is a most spacious vault belonging to the Glanville family. It is perhaps worth noticing that here, while he served the curacy, Mr. Hervey composed his Meditations among the Tombs.

Mr. Lysons says, that the very extensive manor of Tre theves, Lucies, and Rosswick, extends over a great part of this parish, and into Ruan Minor and Grade: it belonged to the Carminows, then to theReskymers, and to Robinson, by whom it was sold in 1768 to Mr. Thomas Fonnereau, after whose death it was purchased by the late Sh Chris topher Hawkins. Mr. Fonnereau came into Cornwall as an adventurer, and chiefly for the purpose of constructing Lighthouses on the Lizard Point, under one of the improvident grants which were frequently made in those times. A single lighthouse stands on St. Agnes Island at Scilly, and three, forming a triangle, on the rocks of Guernsey. Two towers were therefore built on the Lizard, that each Point might be distinct from the others, and experience has proved their utility to be very great. For many years after their construction the lights consisted of coal fires in"], [829, "LANDEWEDNACK. 359 each lantern, after the manner of a smith's forge, and urged in a similar way by bellows ; but the blowing could not be always maintained, and when that had been inter- mitted for a short time the lights nearly disappeared.

By far the greater part of this parish is composed of ser- pentine, which is generally of the red variety, with dark- coloured and shining scales of diallage. South of a line drawn east and west, a little north of the church, across the peninsula of the Lizard, the rocks are for the most part schistose, and are covered with a deep soil, which is exceedingly productive. The cliffs around this part of the parish are very inte resting, and if minutely scrutinized would probably throw some additional light on the nature and position of the"], [830, "360 LANDEWEDNACK. serpentine. To this end it would be necessary to make the survev from the sea, which could only be effected occa sionally, and under very favourable circumstances. At Perranbonse Cove, near the church, the slate is a variety of schistose diallage rock, such as has been already described at Cadgwith. Near the lighthouses the cliff is formed of a glossy de composing talcose slate, which has been called by some ge ologists Micaceous schist, but talc appears to be the cha racteristic mineral, as it is present in a distinct form throughout the veins, with nodules of quartz abounding in this slate. At Hensall Cove the blue slate is much intermixed with calcareous spar in various forms, resembling the slate ad joining the calc shists, and blue limestones at Veryan, Pad stow, and some other parts of Cornwall. The Editor would take the liberty of adding that in this parish veins of steatite run through the serpentine forma tion ; and that considerable quantities have been raised by the late Mr. Wedgwood from some veins larger than the others, and near the cliff. The soft and unctuous qualities of this substance gave it the popular name of soap rock. Thin veins of native copper traverse also the serpentine formation ; but never in sufficient quantities to bear the expense of mining. In some places specimens of semi transparent serpentine are found shot through by branches of native copper, forming what has been termed dendrites. At Kynans Cove the assemblage of rocks possesses such an extraordinary degree of beauty and magnificence as to render it one of the spots most worthy of attention on the whole coast. The interest excited by the general effect is heightened, on a more close inspection, by natural caverns, and the intervals between the rocks are perpetually varied in their appearance by the swell and by the subsidence of waves from the sea. This spot possesses further interest to a botanist by the production of some rare plants.

A manufactory has been recently established for produc ing ornamented trifles from the beautifully coloured and variegated serpentine of this district, and with so much suc cess that vases have been turned in lathes, exceeding a foot in height, and they hope to polish chimney-pieces on a large scale.

There seehis to be but little of importance connected with this parish. The extensive manor of Lanrake is said by Mr. Lysons to have belonged at an early period to the family of St. Margaret, and in the seventeenth century to have belonged to Sergeant Maynard, from whom it passed by marriage to the family of Hobart, and from that to Edgecumbe. This manor includes the advowson of the vicarage ; and the impropriation of the great tithes be longed also to Sergeant Maynard, having been a part of the endowments taken from the Priory of St. Germans. The church town is rather a large village, and the church and tower are of the form and size common throughout Cornwall. The church contains several mo numents. In this parish is another village, called WTotton Cross, and part of a third called Tidiford, where a small river, navigable for barges, and communicating with the Tamar at Hamoaze, divides Landrake from St. Germans. The facility of water communication has established some trade at Tidiford, but it is chiefly remarkable by the great quantities of Plymouth limestone burnt there for manure. The system of using lime in agriculture does not date further back in this district than the early part, or per haps than the middle, of the last century ; and it is sup posed at the least to have doubled the value of all the land, and in consequence to have increased the population, im proved the country, and largely added to all the sources of honest industry and employment. Wotton, as a seat of the Courtenays, must have been in former times a place of some consequence. It belonged to the family of Blake, the heiress of which family has mar ried Francis Dogherty, Esq."], [833, "363 ST. ERNEY. St. Erney. The little parish of St. Erney, being in fact a part of Landrake, except that its church still exists as a chapel supported by a local rate, is not noticed by Mr. Hals under the letter E, and his account of it is therefore lost, with this part of his manuscript. TONKIN. St. Erney, St. Erna, or St. Erne, stands in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north Landrake, upon the south St. Germans Creek, upon the west St. Germans, upon the east Botus- Fleming. San Erna in the Cernawish tongue signifies holy hour, with reference to, I apprehend, the time set apart for the celebration of divine service. In the Saxon and Kerna wish combined, San Erna is an holy or sacred eagle ; and if so, I take it, the name must be construed as relating to the person that officiates at divine service, who, as an eagle, ascends up to heaven for metaphysical or supernatural mys teries \u2014 as St. John the Evangelist, whose similitude is an eagle. In this sense we have Eagle vicarage in Graffo hundred, Lincolnshire. This is a daughter church to Landrake. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons notices the manor of Trelugan, of which Wotton in Landrake seems to be the barton ; and also the manor of Markwell, which he says belonged to Thomas Earl of Lancaster, attainted in the reign of Edward II. Then to the Bodrugans, and after the attaint of Henry de Bodrugan, in the reign of Henry VII. it was granted to Sir John Paulet, and descended to the late Duke of Bolton.

THE EDITOR. The church of Landulph is situated almost on the margin of the shore, and looks directly down the river. It contains monuments of the Lowers, but it has one monument of extraordinary interest, to the memory of Theodore Pa leologus, descended from the last Emperors of Greece, or as they styled themselves in the single city of Constanti nople, Emperors of Rome. A very ample account of all that can be collected with respect to this personage, has been given by the present learned and ingenious rector Mr. Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell, in a communication to the Society of Antiquaries, in 1815. \" In the parish church of Landulph, in the eastern ex tremity of Cornwall, is a small brass tablet fixed against the wall, with the following inscription : \u2014 ' Here lyeth the body of Theodore Paleologus, of Pe saro in Italye, descended from ye Imperyal lyne of ye last Christian emperors of Greece, being the sonne of Camilio, ye sonne of Prosper, the sonne of Theodoro, the sonne of John, ye sonne of Thomas, second brother of Constantine Paleologus, the 8th of that name, and last of yl lyne y' rayned in Constantinople until subdued by the Turks, who married wt Mary, ye daughter of William Balls, of Hadlye in Souffolke, Gent, and had issue 5 children, The odore, John, Ferdinando, Maria, and Dorothy ; and de parted this life at Clyfton, ye 21st 0f Jany, 1636.' \" Above the inscription are the imperial arms proper, of"], [836, "366 LANDULPH. the empire of Greece \u2014 an eagle displayed with two heads, the two legs resting upon two gates ; the imperial crown over the whole, and between the gates a crescent for dif ference as second son. \" The Paleologus dynasty were descended from the imperial race of the Comneni ; and the first of the family was Michael Paleologus about 1270 ; to whom succeeded Andronicus the First and Second, John I., and Emmanuel, who died 1425, leaving six sons. The eldest, John IL, who was associated with his father in the government during his lifetime, succeeded him. Andronicus, the se- cond son, had the principality of Thessalonica, and died of a leprosy soon after the sale of that city to the Venetians. Some fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or the Morea, to the empire ; and in his more prosperous days Emmanuel had fortified the narrow isthmus of six miles with a stone wall and 153 towers. The wall was over- thrown upon the first blast of the Ottomans ; the fertile peninsula might have been sufficient for the four younger brothers, Theodore and Constantine, Demetrius and Thomas, but they wasted in domestic contests the remains of their strength, and the least successful of the rivals were reduced to a life of dependance in the Byzantine palace. On the death of John IL, who survived four years the Hungarian crusade, the royal family by the death of An- dronicus, and the monastic profession of Isidore (or Theo- dore), was reduced to three princes, Constantine, Deme- trius, and Thomas. Of these, the first and last were far distant in the Morea ; but Demetrius, who possessed the domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs at the head of a party. His ambition was not chilled with the public dis tress, and his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics had already disturbed the peace of the country. He would have supplanted his brother, and ascended the throne, but for his mother and the great men, who prevented him. His younger brother, the despot Thomas, also accidentally"], [837, "367 LANDULPH. returning to the capital, asserted the cause of Constantine, who was crowned emperor. \" Demetrius and Thomas now divided the Morea be tween them ; but, though they had taken a solemn oath never to violate the agreement, differences soon arose, and Thomas took up arms to drive Demetrius out of his pos sessions ; Demetrius hereupon retired to Asan, his wife's brother, by whose means he obtained succours from Amu rat, and compelled Thomas to submit the matters in dis pute to the emperor's (Constantine's) arbitration. But that prince refusing to deliver to his brother the territories that fell to his share, Mohammed ordered Thuraken, his governor in the Morea, to assist Demetrius, and demolish the wall that shut up that country. Hereupon Thomas gave him the city of Kalamata, in lieu of the territory of the Skortians, which he detained. Immediately on this event, Mohammed besieged and took Constantinople, in defence of which Constantine was slain. \" The dissensions of the two brothers may be considered a principal cause of the fall of the Greek empire. \" After the capture of Constantinople, Mohammed makes war on Demetrius and Thomas, under pretence of recovering the tribute due to him from them as despots of the Morea ; but he is obliged to retire, and soon after comes to agreement with them. At this time the Alba nians, Thomas's subjects, revolt, and attack Pattras, a city of Achaia, where Thomas resided, but are repulsed ; they would have been, however, ultimately successful, had not Mohammed sent his general Thuraken to their assistance. \" The two brothers again falling out, and endeavouring to supplant each other, Mohammed takes advantage of it, and in 1458 sends an order to the despots of the Morea to pay three years' arrears of ten thousand ducats tribute, or quit the country. In spring following, he marched to attack the Morea, and reduced Corinth, without using force. At the first news of his appearance, Thomas, one of the des pots, retired to Italy with his wife and children ; and De-"], [838, "368 LANDULPH. metrius, the other, submitted of his own accord to the SoL tin, who carried him away to Constantinople. \" Such is the account given in the Universal History from Dukas. The relation of Khalcondylas in the same work is more particular, as well as more favourable to the charac ter of Thomas : ' Prince Thomas having retired from Pylos, repaired to the island of Korfu, where he left his family, and set sail for Italy; at the same time he sent an ambassador to know if Mohammed would give him a great extent of country along the sea coast in exchange for the city of Epidamnum. The Soltan, by way of answer, put the envoy in irons, but soon after sent him back. Thomas arriving at Rome 1461, was lodged in the Pope's palace, and had a pension of three thousand livres for his other expenses.' \" Rycaut, in his History, gives a still higher character of Thomas: ' Thomas getting into the castle of Salme nica, defended the same against the infidels a whole year, when, despairing of relief, he escaped into Italy, where the Pope allowed him a pension till the day of his death.'' Of him M ahomet gave this character : ' That he had found many slaves, but never a man in the Grecian province besides Prince Thomas.' \" But Gibbon has a very contemptible account of the ultimate fate of this unfortunate family. He says, that Demetrius died at Constantinople in a monastic habit, and abject slavery ; that the misery of Thomas was prolonged by a pension of six thousand ducats from the Pope and cardinals ; that he died leaving two sons, Andrew and Manuel, who were educated in Italy; that Manuel the younger returned to Constantinople, where he was main tained by the Soltan, and died, leaving a son, who was lost in the habit and religion of a Turkish slave. The elder brother, Andrew, contemptible to his enemies, and bur thensome to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of his life and marriage, and sold his title to the empires of Constantinople and Trebizond to Charles VIII. in 1494,"], [839, "LANDULPH. 369 who assumed the purple and title of Augustus. And in a note he says, from Du Cange, that the Pal\u00e6ologi of Mont ferrat were not extinct till the next century, but they had forgotten their Greek origin and kindred. \" So degrading is the account this historian gives us of the remains of this celebrated family. It is a grateful task to endeavour to prove his representation in some respects incorrect and undeserved ; as we shall then be authorised to hesitate upon what he tells us as to the rest, and to put a more liberal construction upon the whole. \" From the inscription at Landulph it is clear Thomas had three sons : the third, called John, whose family, though we have no particular mention of them, remained in Italy, at Rome probably, and Pesaro, till the time of Theodore. From the inscription it is also certain that this family was not extinct in 1636, and perhaps some of the descendants are still living in England at this moment. *' The imputation thrown on the Montferrat Paleologi certainly does not apply to this branch, that they had for gotten their Greek origin and kindred ; on the contrary, the inscription proves, from the accuracy of the pedigrees and the arms with the difference of second brother, that the family of Theodore Paleologus, had neither forgotten their Greek origin nor high descent, but still gloried in them, and were scrupulously exact in perpetuating the same. \" The names of Theodore and John occurring in this pe digree, and continued in the family of Theodore, are still stronger evidences. Camillo, Prosper, and Ferdinando, were probably acquired on their connection with Italian families. \"It would be absurd to make any conjectures as to the history of Theodore's predecessors, as we have no docu ments to warrant any conjecture. If we hazard any opinion at all, we may suppose, that when, in 1464, the Venetians under Vetorio Capelli warred against the Turks and attacked Pattras, Thomas's former residence, he pro bably joined them, perhaps fell there ; and in the frequent vol. 11. 2 B"], [840, "370 LANDULPH. wars which afterwards occurred between those powers, John, Theodore, Prosper, and Camillo, were probably not idle spectators, but joined against the common enemy, as well from a recollection of former wrongs, as a hope to regain some part of their ancient possessions. Indeed, their settle ment at Pesaro might have been whilst the duchy of Urbino belonged to the Venetians, and in consideration of the part they took in those wars. \" Theodore Paleologus was born, we may infer from the inscription, at Pesaro. Of his mother we know nothing ; his father was called Camillo. The time of his birth is also uncertain; though, from his marriage in 1615, then a widower, we may suppose him to be then about forty, which carries back his birth to 1575. \" Theodore's removal from Italy, and settlement in Eng land, must have been either compulsive or voluntary. If the former, it was probably either on account, \" 1. Of his religion; or, O st , \" 2. From other causes. \" As to the first, the Paleologus family, from the time of John IL, were reconciled to and in union with the Latin church ; and to this circumstance is probably to be attri buted the protection afterwards afforded to Thomas by the Pope, perhaps through the interest of Cardinal Isidore, the resident nuncio at Constantinople. But the Greek church still differed very materially in many points from the Latin; and though Gregory XIII. founded a college at Rome for the education of the Greek children in the sciences and religion, (and here perhaps Theodore was educated), yet we find him opposing what he called the errors of the Greeks ; and in particular, on his alteration of the calendar he is much incensed against them for refusins to receive it. And again, in the pontificate of Clement VIII. we find him particularly anxious to reform the Greek church, and much enraged at being imposed on by a pre tended embassy from the metropolitan of Russia, which proved to be a forgery. If Theodore, as is most probable,"], [841, "LANDULPH. 371 was still of the Greek Church, these circumstances might have induced the Pope to withdraw the protection and support hitherto afforded to the family. \u2014 But if, 2. To other causes, is to be attributed Theodore's de parture from Italy, it was perhaps from the rigid decree of Sixtus the Fifth, (about the year 1585), prohibiting foreigners from living at Rome, unless they brought a certificate that they were able by some trade or profession to maintain their families. If Theodore's family were then at Rome, and in dependance on the papacy, perhaps Sixtus might enforce this decree to rid himself of a family whose high descent he possibly regarded with a jealous eye, recollecting the meanness of his own origin. Or, the severe famine, which in 1590 afflicted all the ecclesiastical state, might oblige Theodore, among others, to emigrate to another country. \" If, on the other hand, Theodore's departure from Italy was voluntary, as is most probable, it might be from having formed some acquaintance, either with natives of this country, or with foreigners who were coming hither. \"Aboutthe same time that the Greek college was founded at Rome, (and where we may imagine Theodore to have had his education), another was founded called the Scotch college, for children of refugees from Scolland and England. Here we may suppose Theodore to have had some acquaint- ance; nor is it unlikely that when the jubilee in 1601 attracted a vast assemblage of persons from all countries to Rome, some one of these might have prevailed on Theodore to return to England with them. In the same year 1601, the Duke of Braciano, a neighbouring state to Pesaro, came to England, or rather Scotland, on a visit to the King of the Scots his relation. Did Theodore accompany him ? Again, we may suppose him to have volunteered in the war against the Turks under Rodolph II. in whose army were many Englishmen, and in particular Sir Thomas Arundel, whose namesake, and probably friend, Thomas Arundel, resided at Clifton, the subsequent residence of 2b 2"], [842, "372 LANDULPH. Theodore. Did he come over with him ? If not, we may lastly imagine he came here through Sir Henry Killigrew, ambassador about this time to the Venetians or Genoese. The connection between the Arundel, Killigrew, and Lower families, give the most plausibility to the two last conjectures. \" But whatever may be our conjectures as to Theodore's removal from Italy, we know that in 1615 he was actually in England, at Hadley in Suffolk, and (then a widower) married Mary, daughter of William Balls, of that town. No traces of the Balls family remain at present, either from tradition or otherwise, except the register of Theodore's marriage ; and even here, Mr. Wilkins, the minister, who has favoured me with a copy of this register, says that it is too mutilated and imperfect to decipher accurately the name of Paleologus. \" The issue of this marriage, as the monument tells us, were five children, Theodoro, John, Ferdinando, Maria, and Dorothy, all of whom must have been born before Theodore left the eastern part of the kingdom ; for the register of Landulph, perfect till the year 1629, makes no mention whatever of the name. He could not therefore have settled at Clifton in Landulph earlier than 1622 or 1623. \" Clifton, a sew years before this, in 1 600, was the mansion of the Arundels; but in 1630, Sir Nicholas Lower, a Cornish gentleman, who married Sir Henry Killigrew's daughter, was living at Clifton. Between these two dates Paleologus must have come here ; and what is more parti cular, he died at Clifton in 1636, at the very time that Clifton was the residence of Sir Nicholas Lower. \" I have made repeated inquiries of the old people of the parish, but not the slightest tradition remains respect ing him ; and here again conjecture must supply the place of fact. When Theodore came to Clifton, he came with his family, for by the register it appears one of his daughters married in the parish, and the other died here unmarried."], [843, "LANDULPH. 373 There must then have been some connection either be tween the Arundel or Lower families and himself. \" As to the first supposition, if it is probable he came into England with Sir Thomas Arundel from the battles in Hungary, we may suppose Sir Thomas recommended him to Landulph, as from its vicinity to the sea and warmth of climate, more nearly resembling the climate and situation of Pesaro than any other place in the kingdom. In this case we may suppose him to have taken Clifton for a term, and as the house appears to have been originally divided into two, the subsequent occupier, Sir Nicholas Lower and Paleologus, might be both living at Clifton at the same time, unconnected with each other. \" The more probable supposition, however, is, that he settled at Clifton from the connection that subsisted be tween Sir Henry Killigrew (who, I feel strongly inclined to believe, brought him to England) and Sir Nicholas Lower. Sir Nicholas Lower married Sir Henry's daugh ter, and as they were now advanced in life, without any family, the society of Paleologus and his children might be desirable to them ; particularly when we recollect that this was the time when the Greek language was so much in fashion in England, that even ladies studied it most zea lously ; that Lady Killigrew was one of the learned daugh ters of Sir Anthony Cooke, celebrated for her literary attainments, and particularly her knowledge of Greek ; and it is reasonable to suppose her daughter, Lady Lower, wife of Sir Nicholas, was brought up with the same fond ness for the classic languages ; and where could she ex pect to find so able an instructor as a descendant of the first family in the Greek empire ; or what place could be more suited to classical pursuits than the retirement of a country mansion, such as Clifton. \" On the 21st of January 1636, as appears by the monu ment, Theodore Paleologus died at Clifton, Sir Nicholas and Lady Lower being still alive ; of whom the latter died in 1638, and Sir Nicholas in 1655."], [844, "374 LANDULPH. \" The Landulph register, perfect from 1540 to 1628, has then a great chasm till the year 1649; and during this interval all the entries that would have been probably most interesting to our inquiries were made. \" Some little time since 1 examined the duplicates of parish registers, deposited in the room of archives in Exe ter cathedral ; and after a laborious search among the regis ters of two centuries, thrown promiscuously together with out arrangement as to either parishes or dates, and those for the most part obliterated by the damp, I had the good fortune to recover the Landulph register for the year 1636, which had the following entry : \" ' Theodore Palleologus was buryed the 20th daye of October.' \" By the monument Theodore is said to have died the 21st of January 1636 ; from the register it appears he was buried October 20, 1636. It can hardly be supposed the body was kept from January till October, and the difficulty is increased from the knowledge, that by the mode of cal culation in use at that time, the year commenced at Lady day; so that, if he died January 21, 1636, the 20th of October following must have been in 1637. \" The body, if it remained any considerable time unin terred, would have been inclosed in a lead coffin ; but this was not the case, for about twenty years ago, when the vault was accidentally opened, the coffin of Paleologus was seen, a single oak coffin ; and curiosity prompting to lift the lid, the body of Paleologus was discovered, and in so per fect a state as to ascertain him to have been in stature much above the common height, his countenance of an oval form, much lengthened, and strongly marked by an aque line nose, and a very white beard reaching low on the breast. \" Of the five children left by him, no traces remain of two sons, John and Ferdinando. Whether they joined the brothers of Sir Nicholas Lower, who were distinguished cavaliers on the king's side in the unhappy wars that dis-"], [845, "LANDULPH. 375 traded the country soon after the death of Theodore, and in which Major Lower gallantly fell ; or whether the miser able state of England induced them again to re-visit Italy, cannot be ascertained. \" Theodore was a sailor, and served on board the Charles II. Captain Gibson. He died at sea 1693, as appears by a will and power in the Commons, obligingly communicated to me by Francis Townsend, Esq. Windsor Herald. This is dated August 1, 1693, and solely in * favour of his wife Martha. If he had any children they are not named in it. The signature is Theodore Paleo logey; and though described simply as mariner, it should seem he was possessed of landed estate, as there are four witnesses, Charles Gibson, commander, J. Wright, John Cometh, Richard Roberts. \" Mary Paleologus died at Landulph unmarried in 1674 ; and her sister Dorothy was married in 1656 to William Arundel, the grandson probably of Alexander Arundel, of Clifton. This marriage is registered at Landulph and St. Mellion, as solemnised in both parishes ; the entry at the latter is, ' Dorothea Paleologus de stirpe Imperatorum/ Soon after their marriage they settled in St. Dominick, an adjoining parish, the registers of which having been acci dentally destroyed, it is impossible now to determine if they had any issue, though it seems highly probable. They were both buried at Landulph, Dorothy in 1681, and her husband in 1684 ; and as some years after, a Mary Arun del was married to Francis Lee, the imperial blood per haps still flows in the bargemen of Cargreen !\" The manor of Landulph is traced back to the family of D'Alneto, from whom it passed to the Courtenays, and fell to the Crown on the attainder of Henry Courtenay, Mar quis of Exeter, in 1539, soon after which it was annexed to the duchy of Cornwall. The manor of Glebridge has passed through various families, and is now the property of Mr. Bluett. But the principal place in this parish was Clifton. Sir John Arundell is said to have built the house about the"], [846, "376 LANDULPH, OR LAND1LIP. year 1500. It is believed to have afterwards belonged to the Killigrews, as it passed in succession to Sir Nicholas Lower and Sir Reginald Mahon, who married the daugh ters of Sir Henry Killigrew. The former died without issue ; and it was ultimately sold with the other property of the Mahons to Pitt. The Lowers had their principal seat at St. Winnow, and were eminent during several successions. Some of this family were distinguished by their proficiency in science, and by their friendships with scientific men. This has been very recently made prominent in a work that cannot re- ceive too much commendation, either for the accuracy, the ability, or for the industry displayed by its author.

THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The geology of this parish is precisely similar to that of the adjacent parish of St. Clether. The northern part is situated on that range of downs which extends from Launceston to the British Channel. These downs consist principally of varieties of dunstone, which are sometimes selspathic ; but in general they are very siliceous, and even quartzoze. They are interesting in an economical point of view, as containing extensive depo- sits of the ores of manganese. A mine of this substance has been long worked at Letcot in Laneast. The ores occur in a lode or cross course of capel, running north-east and south-west ; the lode is about twelve fathoms in width, and is composed of siliceous materials, or rather varieties of compact felspar, in which silex greatly predominates. The ore is arranged throughout the substances of the lode in veins and branches. In the latter form it was originally discovered, not many feet below the surface, and in such abundance that it was obtained at a very trifling cost, for the hardness and tenacity of the capel permitted the ore to be followed in all its ramifications without needing support: and the result of these operations has been to produce a large chasm, with curiously irregular and indented sides.

In the year sixteen hundred and .... John Lord Robarts, being disgusted on some occasion or other with the town of Truro, left his barony-house there, and new built a large one in this place, quadrangularwise, to which he added after wards a noble gate-house, and enclosed a very handsome park, well-wooded, and watered by the river Fowey. This noble lord was afterwards, in 1662, made Lord Privy Seal, in the place of William Lord Say, deceased. In Sept. 1669 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but continued there no longer than the May following ; and about this time he received the honour of being made Cus- tos Rotulorum of Cornwall. In 1679, July 20, he was created Earl of Falmouth and Viscount Bodmin, but he kept the title of Falmouth only six days, when he got it changed to that of Radnor.

He married, secondly, a daughter of John Smith, Esq. of Kent, a lady of great beauty, who, it is said, was to have married his eldest son the Lord Bodmin ; for which reason there was never a good understanding between the father and son. By her he had several children, the eldest of which was Francis Ro- barts, a very ingenious man, and a great mathematician, author of several small works.

THE EDITOR. Henry Robarts, the third Earl of Radnor, in possession ofthe property when Mr. Tonkin wrote, was succeeded by his cousin John Robarts, son of Francis Robarts, youngest son of John Robarts, the first Earl of Radnor ; and with him, who died in 1764, the family became extinct in the male line; and the estate reverted to a sister's son of Henry Robarts, who had married Thomas Hunt, Esq. of Mellington in Cheshire. Mr. George Hunt, the eldest son of this marriage, re sided occasionally at Lanhidrock, and represented Bodmin in several Parliaments. This gentleman never married, and he was succeeded by his brother's daughter, Anna Maria, now (1834) the widow of the Hon. Charles Bag nal Agar : left with an only son, who has assumed the name of Robarts. It is obvious that all families, to whatever degrees of ele vation they may afterwards ascend, must at some period or another have emerged from the ordinary fortunes of man kind. At the time of the Norman Conquest, hundreds started forth at once by successful warfare and confiscation ; others have risen or fallen by the chances of civil war, favouritism, marriages, adventures, or speculation in foreign countries, by professions, or commerce; these last have recently been more efficacious for ordinary indi viduals and families than force of arms. The family of Robarts, illustrious as it has since been, derives its origin entirely from trade, and that too con ducted in the town of Truro, now indeed, and for a century past, a place of opulence, and connected with a productive mining district, where several ample fortunes have been acquired ; but in the reign of the Tudors it could have been no more than an obscure place in a remote province. There is nothing known of any particularly fortunate oc currence which might have heaped wealth on this family;"], [852, "382 LANHIDROCK. they probably accumulated patiently through several gene- rations from father to son, when the rate of interest on all capital gave a facility to the increase of wealth unknown at the present day. That the family made their progress in the world after this manner, is evinced by the nature of the possessions transmitted to their heirs. Extensive on the whole, but instead of being made up of large masses, like those acquired in feudal times, it mainly consists of small pieces of land scattered over the country, on which the successful merchant or dealer lent his superfluous money on mortgage, and afterwards entered into possession or foreclosed. The first Lord Robarts, created a Baron through the influence of George Villiers Duke of Buckingham, with King James the First,* who emerged from Truro, and built or improved the house at Lanhidrock, and planted in all probability the magnificent avenues, must have been a man worthy of his high fortune. The editor remembers the house, a complete square, with a superb barbican in front, united to the house, or rather castle, by two lofty walls. These walls were first taken down, and then the front, by Mr. George Hunt, wbich he replaced by green palisades. This gentleman had the reputation of being a classical scholar, and he travelled into the south of Europe, where Taste once fixed her abode, and where she still lingers or loves often to return; but according to all the opinions now enter tained, he never met her in his walks, nor profited by the contemplation of her works. Perhaps in his youth the pre judice had not disappeared which confined all the elegance and beauty of architecture to upright pillars with horizon tal cornices, and esteemed the word Gothic as of the same import with barbarous, and inviting destruction wherever it was applied. This parish was heretofore a complete impropriation to the priory at Bodmin, in respect to small tithes as well as the great; and being situated so near the monastery, it was * See Nichols's Progresses, &c. of King James, iii, 230."], [853, "LANHIDROCK. 383 probably served from thence, and considered as exempt from the canon enjoining the residence of some spiritual person on all benefices, and it has continued a donative to the present time. Mr. Tonkin conjectures that the parish is dedicated to a Saint Hydrock, or Hidrock. No such name is to be found ; but it may belong to the list of mis sionaries. The Editor remembers to have heard as facts, from an old lady of Bodmin, who died many years before the words ' political economy,' were pronounced in England, that the last Lord Radnor kept house at Lanhidrock in the style of ancient baronial magnificence ; that a bullock was killed every week, and a sheep every day ; and that what- ever remained over-night of meat, of broken bread, or of certain allowed quantities of beer, were on the morning distributed at the gate ; and that in consequence the whole neighbourhood became idle, depraved, and vicious, to such a degree as to force itself on the notice of every one, and to produce a full conviction of the utter destruction that must ensue if it were possible that such mistaken liberality could be common. The manor of Lanhidrock belonged in former times to the Glynns, of Glynn. Mr. Lysons says that it passed from them as a marriage portion to the family of Lyttleton, and from them by a heiress to Trenance ; and that in the year 1620 Lyttleton Trenance, Esq. sold it to Sir Richard Ro- berts, afterwards created Lord Truro. Mr. Tonkin has stated that this gentleman built the house ; but the whole place has the appearance of much greater antiquity : that he improved and decorated the building, and perhaps added the barbican and the connecting walls, is very probable.

In treating of the estates of this parish, I shall begin with Tremere, the great town, called in Domesday book Tremer, being one of the numerous manors in this county given by William the Conqueror to his half brother, Robert Earl of Morton, with the Earldom of Cornwall. Mr. Carew calls it Tremore. It had formerly owners of the same name, who, I sup pose, held it in vassalage under the Earls of Cornwall ;"], [855, "385 LANIVET. they gave for their arms, Argent, three reap-hooks con joined in the blades Sable. The last of whom was John Tremere, Esq. of this place, who left two daughters and heirs ; Alice, married to Geoffrey St. Aubyn, of Clowance, Esq. which Alice, as appears by the inscription on her hus band's tomb-stone in Crowan church, died the 1st of May 1400. And This place hath been for several generations the seat of the Courtenays, whom I take to be a younger branch of those of Trethurse, to whom they have at length been heirs; for the present owner's grandfather, Humphry Courtenay, Esq. during many years, and up to his de cease, Representative in Parliament for the borough of Michell, married the daughter of Sir Peter Courtenay, of Trethurse, and eventually sole heiress to her brother Wil liam Courtenay. Their son, William Courtenay, married the daughter of Kelland, of Peynsford in Devonshire, and their son Kelland Courtenay, Esq. is the present possessor, 1734; Member of Parliament for Truro; he has two daughters, both as yet unmarried. THE EDITOR. On the decease of Mr. Charles Courtenay, son of the last-mentioned Kelland Courtenay in 1761, all the pro perty devolved on his two sisters ; one of whom married William Poyntz, Esq. of Berkshire, and the other Ed mund Boyle, Earl of Cork. Tremere, with much of the other property, has been sold ; and Mr. William Stephen Poyntz has acquired the Boyle share of what remains. This extensive parish contains several villages. The Church Town, Bodwanick, Bokiddick, Lamorick, St. In ganger, Trebell, Tregullan, Tremoore, and Woodly, with vol. n. 2 c"], [856, "386 LANIVET. a part of St. Lawrence, the locality of an ancient incor porated lazar-house. The church and tower may be considered as handsome models of western ecclesiastic architecture, where all are superior to the average of other districts. This tower, as well as the adjoining one of Roach, are without the usual ornament of pinnacles. In the church are some monuments; one to the me mory of Mr. Richard Courtenay and Thomasin his wife, dated in 1632, is remarkable for its simplicity and quaint ness of its inscription : They lived and died both in Tremere, God hath their souls, their bunes lie here ; Richard with Thomseo his loved wife, Lived sixty-one years \u2014 then ended life. The advowson of this parish was purchased about the middle of the last century by M r. Phillipps, a substantial yeoman of Roach ; and the Editor has heard for a thou sand pounds. It now belongs to his great-grandson, the Reverend William Phillipps, who is the Rector. This parish possesses the curious and interesting re mains of a convent or female monastery, dedicated to St. Bennet. Very little is known of its history. The remote, and in former times almost inaccessible, situation of Cornwall, and perhaps the frequent insurrections during the reign of Henry the Seventh and of Edward the Sixth, have in volved the history of its religious institution in a greater obscurity than what hangs over any other part of England. This nunnery is believed to have been a cell to some foreign convent ; and it is not certainly known whether it was entirely suppressed by Henry the Fifth, or whether, as some have conjectured, it became attached to the priory of Bodmin, and remained a parcel of that house till the gene ral dissolution. It belonged for a considerable period to the Courtenavs"], [857, "LANIVET. 387 of Tremere, and in a state of repair, for there is a tradi tion of its having made some defence in the great Civil War, till cannon were used against it. It was sold in the year 1710; and about ten years after wards became the property of Mr. Grose, a farmer of the parish. His son or grandson, about the year 1775, built a new house on the farm, when some remains of a beautiful cloister, which the Editor faintly remembers, afforded a ready supply of materials. It is said, that Mr. George Hunt, of Lanhidrock, more impressed by the elegance of these ruins than by the splendour of his own house, inter fered to the extent of remonstrance for their preservation ; but when the proprietor replied that he would willingly spare them, if the difference of expense for getting stone from a neighbouring quarry were paid him, nothing fur ther was done. The mere site of the building has been purchased within twenty years by the Rev. Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell, Rector of Landulph; and in the present year this sequestered spot \u2014 scarcely visible in any direction at the distance of half a mile, inclosed in a deep vale, and surrounded by trees more lofty than its half-ruined tower; the appropriate retreat of those who choose their lot \u2014 The world forgetting, by the world forgot, Where round some mould'ring tow'r pale ivy creeps, And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps; \u2014 is by the progress of recent improvement laid open to public view, and above all to the inspection of strangers. A hill so steep as to be dangerous for carriages, and ex tending to a mile in length, has been avoided, by conduct ing the London road through this valley, which, after an interval, perhaps, of a thousand years from the time when it was devoted to superstitious observances, directly op posed to the benevolence inseparable from the Author of all Good, and congenial only to the demon of evil, has at last become subservient to general utility. This parish is possessed of certain lands, some within its 2c 2"], [858, "388 LANIVET. own limits, but others at considerable distances in other parishes. These are held by twelve feoffees, called the twelve men of the parish, a species of select vestry, which existed in all large parishes in Cornwall down to the early part of the last century, till it was tacitly done away by those improvident or insane acts of the legislature, made no doubt in conformity with the existing prejudices of the times, which have generated a rapidly increasing tribe of lazzaroni, threatening, if their progress cannot now be checked, most infallibly to reduce this once flourishing country, the favoured seat of arts, of science, of morals, and of legitimate refinement, to a state of vice and of de gradation, worse than that of savages in their primeval con dition of wandering hunters. The rents are applied to the support of a school, and to some specific charities, and the surplus given in aid of the poor rate. Mr. Lysons says, that these lands belonged to Credys in Padstow, a cell to St. Bennet's. This does not, how ever, seem to be very probable, considering the nature of St. Bennet's foundation. It is more likely that the lands were the immediate possession of this convent ; and no such place as Credys is noticed by Tanner. The history of Lanivet would here close, but the Edi tor hopes that he may be allowed to bestow a few lines on the Reverend John Lake, Rector of this parish more than thirty years ; possessed of learning, piety, and benevolence, In wit a man, simplicity a child. He was educated in Truro, according to a custom evi dently derived from Catholic times, in the acquirementof some classical knowledge, and then placed in an inferior line of bu siness at Leskeard, where at that period resided Mr. Hey don as schoolmaster, an ornament to his country by every species of learning and of acquirement. Here Mr. Lake, forgetful 'ot his having married early in life, and of a growing family, devoted his time to assisting Mr. Heydon, and in obtaining knowledge from his conversation, till on"], [859, "LANIVET. 389 a sudden he found himself deprived of his wife, left with two daughters, and his business failed. Thus circumstanced, Mr. Lake placed the two daughters with his father; and having collected a hundred and thirty pounds, he proceeded to Oxford, became a member of Magdalen Hall, and contrived, on this scanty supply, to keep terms and to obtain orders. He then returned into Cornwall, served the curacy of Roach, and there married the daughter or sister of Mr. Phillipps, who had purchased the advowson of Lanivet ; and a vacancy occurring in the course of a few years, he obtained the rectory. Here he again became a widower, and married a third time Miss Bridget Hoblin, of Bodmin, by whom he had two sons. The eldest became a Fellow of Wadham, and the other of Exeter College. Both his daughters were dead; and in May 1805, Mr. Lake departed this life, hav ing completed his 76th year, in peace with all men, hav ing been pious without fanaticism, and to the utmost of his power, a practiser of the good doctrines which he taught. His widow was left with a competence; and his sons were advanced by their merits and their talents into situa- tions at once honourable and lucrative ; but permanent happiness in this world was not to be their lot. William went to sea, and was lost with Admiral Reynolds in a first rate ship of the line ; and the second, after struggling with a consumption, expired in his mother's arms.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The southern part of the parish reposes on granite ; and proceeding northward, the next portion is composed of"], [860, "390 LANIVET. rocks of the porphyritic series, which are again succeeded by those of the calcareous series. The middle portion is by far the most extensive, the other two occupying only a narrow part, on the extreme southern and northern parts of the parish. The middle, or porphyritic series, presents the most interesting phenomena. Lanivet Hill is covered with large boulders and pro jecting torrs of massive rock, which have the appearance of granite ; but on examination it proves to be a felspar rock. The greater part of this hill is composed of lamellar and slatey varieties of the same kind of rock, as may be seen in the rubbish of the numerous shafts that occur on the side of this hill. On the road to Bodmin, near the boundary of the parish, is a very interesting elvan course. The upper part of it is completely decomposed, resembling a mass of prepared China clay ; the perfect rock is a greenish yellow compact felspar, with disseminated grains of quartz ; it bears the same relation to the porcelainous granite of this and of the adjoining parishes, that the hard porphyritic elvans do to the common Cornish granite, near which they generally occur.

Since the writing of the above I have thought upon ano ther etymology, which I believe to be the true one ; that this name is no other than a softening of Lan-le-Vorch, St. Vorch's church-place, which is a very easy and natural alteration. THE EDITOR. The church and town of Llanlivery are very conspicu ous objects for miles round, and especially from the Ply mouth or great southern road. The church contains various monuments to the family of Kendall. This family were originally of Treworgy, in the parish of Dulo, but have long resided at Pelyn, in this parish. The house is beautifully situated in a small wooded valley, joining in a transverse course the river Fowey, about a mile below Lestwithiel. There appears to be a vague tradition of some religious establishment having existed here, dedicated to St. Chad, or Ceada, the patron of Lichfield, Worcester, and Shrewsbury. No trace, how- ever, can be found of any such establishment; and it is probable that these tales frequently rest on no more solid foundation that the casual residence of some monk or an chorite, or perhaps on the dedication of a domestic chapel. There still exists at Pelin a small summer house, consi dered asunder the protection of this saint; and an inscrip tion records the festivities and friendly meetings of four gen-"], [862, "392 LANLIVERY. tlemen annually on the 2d of March, to commemorate the day, when, according to the legend, this Saint expired amid a company of angels, singing hymns for the solace of his dying moments, and for joy of such an accession to the heavenly mansions. The inscription is as follows, under a portrait of the Saint : Friend, within these walls St. Chad you see, A place made sacred to his memory ; For here four friends did meet upon this day, And heads, and hands, and hearts together lay ; And never dying friendship's knot to tye, And call this place St. Chad's Society. March 2, 1694. The glory of this parish, however, is Restormel Castle, but these buildings have been so amply described by almost every writer on Cornish antiquities, that it would be idle to repeat what has been so often done. It presents one of the finest objects in the whole country. Richard, King of the Romans, is believed to have kept court here, and in his more commodious habitation at Lestwithiel, and he was the last who exercised even the semblance of independent authority. The earldom and dukedom of Cornwall have, since his time, done no more than afford a revenue and bestow a name, like the shadows of a shade, with which the private gentlemen, holding here ditary seats in Parliament at the present time, continue to decorate themselves, by assuming the verbal denominations of offices extinct above three centuries, and which habit alone enables us to pronounce, as applicable to them, with out a smile ; but which offices, like the ancient earldom of Cornwall, while they had any existence, conferred real feudal sovereignty, proportionate to their different degrees. The palace at Lestwithiel has degenerated into a prison for the stannary courts ; and that town no longer witness ing the county election, nor holding any of its own, may still boast of its being in some degree at the head of a duchy jurisdiction. There is a handsome seat almost at the foot of Restor-"], [863, "393 LANREATH. mel Hill now called Restormel, but formerly Trinity. It seems to have been built after leases of the park were granted by the Crown. It has passed through various hands, and finally into those of the Edgecumbe family, who have been supposed desirous, up to very recent times, of acquir ing all species of property, and, most of all, gentlemen's residences, situated near Lestwithiel. The late Mr. Francis Gregor lived here in 1790, when he was first elected member for the county, and it is at present held under Lord Mount Edgecumbe by Mr. Francis Hext, a gentleman of ancient family and ample fortune, and uni versally esteemed.

Richard de Cereseaux, I suppose father to the former, was one of those that had 20/. per annum of lands or rent, or more, 25 Edward I., and was summoned to attend the King, and to go into parts beyond sea. Richard Sargeaux, son, I believe, of the former, was Sheriff of this county the 12th of Richard II. A.D. 1389. This I take to be the same person with that Richard de Seriseaux who sold his estate in the 3d of Henry IV. He held lands also in Kelland and Kilkoid in the hundred of Trigg.

This Sir Richard Ceriseaux must have lived to a great age, since his great-grandson, Geffrey St. Aubin, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall but ten years after him, in 22d Richard II. A.D. 1399, or, 1 rather suppose, that this Sir Richard Ceriseaux may have left a son, who was the Sheriff, and that upon his death, without issue, Alice his sister became the heir. THE EDITOR. It appears from Mr. Lysons's researches, that the manor of Lanreath, with the barton of Court, passed from the Serjeaux to Pashleys, Chudleys, and diamonds, from which last they were carried by heiresses to Trevanion and Grylls. William Grylls, of Tavistock, is said in a pedigree of that family to have married the widow of Knight, and to have settled at Court in Lanreath ; perhaps this lady was the coheiress of Chamond. Their son, Charles Grylls, bred to the higher depart ment of the law, married Agnes, daughter of Charles Tubb, Esq. and by this marriage a very considerable pro perty was acquired in the parish of St. Neot, where one of the painted windows, the sixth, had been given by the Tubbs ; but where their descendant the Reverend Richard Gerveys Grylls has, with equal taste and munificence, raised the splendid decorations of this church to a degree of perfection exceeding that of their original state, although"], [866, "396 LANREATH. they are some of the most curious and beautiful specimens of the arts and of the piety of former times, that have escaped the fury of passions excited by great changes m religion and in civil government.

The church, which is a fine one with a lofty tower, yet almost obscured by trees, has a monument recording the decease of Charles Grylls, Esq. on the 2d of March 1612, and of Alice his wife on the 13th of June 1607. Their son, John Grylls, took a part in the Civil War, as indeed every Cornish gentleman was obliged to do, on one side or the other ; for in Cornwall, which might well have been conjectured likely to remain almost free from actual conflicts, two considerable armies were routed in pitched battles, and two still larger were forced to capi tulate. This gentleman was knighted by King Charles the First on the field of battle. He married Grace, daughter and coheiress of William Bear, Esq. A monument in Lanreath church testifies that he was buried there on the 30th day of September 1649. Their eldest son, Charles, resided on his estate in this parish, and married a lady of the family of Mahon. John, his son and heir, resided also at Court ; he mar ried Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress of Richard Ger veys, Esq. Charles, their eldest son, married Mary, daughter of Edmund Spoure, Esq. of Trebartha, but died without issue. This gentleman sold the manor of Lanreath, with the barton of Court and the advowson of the living ap pended, to Mr. Buller, of Morval.

The manor of Botelett is stated by Mr. Lysons to have belonged at an early period to the family of Botreaux, the last of whom, Lord Botreaux, died in the year 1462, leaving an only daughter, who married Robert Lord Hun gerford. It has in more recent times belonged to the families of Roberts and Treville. It became divided by coheiresses of the latter between Trelawny and Cross ; and the latter half has passed to the family of Lethbridge in Somerset shire. The manor of Treyer is also stated by Mr. Lysons to have been the joint property of Rashleigh and Glynn ; but in consequence of an exchange to be now Mr. Glynn 's solely ; and that Trewen, a seat of the Dandys, and Trecan, a seat of the Lowers, are now farm-houses.

Be sides the church town, this parish contains three villages, Tregavethick, Tregou, and Trenewan. The manor of Lansallas has been traced by Mr. Tonkin to Mr. Thomas Long, of Penheale. Mr. Long left three daughters, as has been noticed under Egloskerry. One of these ladies married Mr. Charles Phillipps, of Camelford, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Corn wall Militia, and Member for Camelford. Neither of the sisters had any family ; and on a division of the property, this manor came to Mr. Phillipps, who left it jointly to his two brothers, Jonathan Phillipps, a Captain in the Militia, and the Reverend William Phillipps, Rector of Lanteglos by Camelford. The former gave his share of this manor to his sister's daughter, married to her relation Mr. Wins loe, directing them to take the name of Phillipps ; the latter gave his portion to his sister's son, Mr. John Phil-"], [870, "400 LANSALLOS. lipps Carpenter, of Mount Tavy, from whom the shares have respectively descended to Thomas Phillipps, Esq. of Landue, and to John Carpenter, Esq. of Mount Tavy. Mr. Lysons mentions the manor of Raphel, formerly Rathwell, which belonged to the family of Hywis, and was sold to Speccot ; and has followed the great manor of Lan< sallas, to which the rectory is appended. The manor of Tregavithick belonged to the family of Avery, but has been purchased by the Rev. Joshua Howell. The manor of Polvethan belongs to Mr. Rashleigh, of Menabilly. The most remarkable place, situated partly in this parish, is Polperro, a small town lying on a cove, rendered secure for coasting vessels by a double pier, and affording an ad mirable staking for the fisheries. It was also distin guished for a precarious trade, occasionally heaping great wealth on individuals, but in general taking it away more rapidly than it accumulated. Hinc apicem rapax Fortuna, cum stridore acuto Sustulit, hie posuisse gaudet. Quem dies vidit veniens superbum, Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem. This is, however, at an end, or greatly diminished.

The rocks of this parish belong to the calcareous series. A little north-west of the church a copper mine ha.s been worked ; among the rubbish of which a fine blue slate is very abundant, but which appears to differ from the rocks _ at the surface, merely by those having acquired a red co lour from further oxidation of the iron. The strata near the coast dip landward at an angle of about 45\u00b0, being broken here and there by narrow gorges, through which the rivulets flow into the sea. At Polperro the scenery is very fine ; and the narrow entrance into the harbour, which seems to indicate some great catastrophe, is an object much interest to the speculative geologist.

This parish is now said to be in the hundred of Lesnewith ; yet formerly, when the three northern hundreds of Trigg, Lesnewith, and Stratton composed but two, Trigg Major and Trigg Minor, it was in the hundred of Trigg Minor, in which deanery it is still reckoned as to the ecclesiastical juris diction. The manor takes its name from its once chief place, though now but a village, about a mile to the west of Ca melford. Here, I suppose, the Duke had a castle ; for there were two parks, which, though now disparked, do still retain the name. They* are adjoining to this village ; the one called the Deer Park, and the other Hellesbury Park, the walls of which are still standing ; and the latter of the two is of large extent, formerly well wooded, and watered by the river Alan, being a place exceedingly well fitted for country sports ; and no doubt, when the Earls of Cornwall held their Court at Tintagel Castle, this place was in much repute, not being five miles distant from it. These two parks are now held by a lease of three lives from the Duke of Cornwall, by Mr. Nicholas Dennithorne of St. Agnes. I next come to the town of Camelford, so called from the ford here over the Alan; \"called also,\" saith Mr. Cam den, \" Comb Alan and Camel from its winding channel, for Cam with them implies as much.\" At the head of this river Alan is seated Camelford, other wise written Galleford, \u2014 a little village, formerly called Kambton, in the opinion of Leland, who tells us that Ar thur, the British Hector, was slain here. For, as he adds, pieces of armour, rings, and brass furniture for horses, are sometimes digged up here by- the countrymen ; and, after so many ages, the tradition of a bloody victory in this place is still preserved. There are also extant some verses of a middle age poet, about \" Camels\" running with blood after the battle of Arthur against Mordred."], [873, "LANTEGLOS, JUXTA CAMELFORD. 403 In the mean time, not to deny the truth of this story concerning Arthur, I have read in Marianus, mentioned also in the Saxon Chronicle, of a bloody battle here be tween the Britons and Saxons in the year 820, so that the place may seem to be sacred to Mars. And if it be true that Arthur was killed here, the same shore both gave him his first breath and deprived him of his last. Harrison also saith, that to this day men that do eare (till) the ground there, do oft plough up bones of a large size, and great store of armour; or else it may be (as I rather conjecture) that the Romans had some field or castra there about, for not long since (and in the remembrance of men) a brass pot full of Roman coins was found there, as I have often heard. To these Mr. Carew adds (p. 288, Lord de Dunstan ville's edition) \" Camelford, a market and fair, but not fair town, fetcheth his derivation from the river Camel, which runneth through it, and that from the Cornish word Cam, in English crooked, as Cam from the often winding stream. The same is incorporated with a mayoralty, and nameth burgesses to Parliament; yet steppeth little before the meanest sort of boroughs for store of inhabitants, or the inhabitants' store. Upon the river of Camel, near to Camelford, was that last dismal battle stricken between the noble King Arthur and his treacherous nephew Mordred, wherein the one took his death, and the other his death wound. For testimony whereof, the old folk thereabouts will shew you a stone, bearing Arthur's name, though now depraved to Atry.\" Then follows what is before quoted out of Mr. Camden. Mr. Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, says, Camel ford was created a borough by Richard Earl of Cornwall, who, when King of the Romans, by his charier made this place a free borough, and granted the burgesses a Friday market, and a fair on the eve, day, and morrow of St. Swithin, all which liberties were confirmed by his brother King Henry the Third, by his charter, dated at Westmin ster June the 12th, 1259, and in the 44th year of his reign, 2d2"], [874, "404 LANTEGLOS, JUXTA CAMELFORD. as appears from an inspeximus in Queen Mary's time, of confirmation of liberties to Camelford, in whose reign this poor borough was encouraged to send burgesses to Par- iament, which it had begun to do in the preceding reign of Edward the Sixth. The present charter of incorpora tion is said to be granted by King Charles the First; and the manor of the borough to be held by the corporation of the duchy of Cornwall to which it belongs. It is governed by a mayor and eight burgesses or aldermen, who with ten freemen, elect the members of Parliament. The corporation, which is doubtless ancient, enjoys the tolls of the markets and fairs, with an estate also of 15/. per annum, which helps to support the dignity of other wise a very mean magistracy. All these revenues are re puted worth about 80/. per annum. The seal of arms pre tended to by this town, seems to be in imitation of the device of Oxford, for as the arms of that city are an ox passant over a river, so this has a camel.* Here is only one street of ordinary building, of not above fifty or sixty houses, all of which are in the parish of Lan teglos ; to the church of which place, distant about a mile, the inhabitants repair to hear divine service. There was formerly a chapel, which is reported to have been con verted into a dwelling-house : it is not known to what saint this chapel was dedicated. Dodridge's History of the Duchy of Cornwall tells us, that the chief rent payable to the said Duchy by this borough, is 4/. 5s. Ad. THE EDITOR.

Besides the town of Camelford, this parish abounds in villages : Fenterwarson, Fooda, Helston, Tre frew, Treegoodwell, Tremagenna, Trevia, and Trewalder. At Fentonwoon in this parish was born Capt. Wallis, celebrated for his voyage round the world and the disco- very of Otaheite. The right of voting for members of Parliament having been declared by a Committee of the House of Commons, reported on the 10th of November 1796, \" to be in the free men, being inhabitants and paying scot and lot ; and that the capital burgessess as such, have not the right ;\" it became important to acquire as much as possible of the property within the borough to secure political influence; and after various sales and transfers, Lord Darlington at last suc ceeded in acquiring the whole. The civil corporation hold the manor, mentioned by Mr. Tonkin to have been given by Charles the First, in the capacity of lord of the manor ; but the freemen are per sons presented by the homage in the Lord's Court. It is almost needless to add that, when the whole property came into a single hand, and that residence with the payment of scot and lot were requisite to complete the power of voting in one presented by the homage, the Borough became what is well understood by the term \" quite close,\" and that it continued so till its extinction in 1832, since which the property has been sold in parcels. When Mr. Thomas Pitt, of Boconnock, received in 1784 the grant of an hereditary seat in Parliament, and it became necessary, according to the established custom, to create an imaginary office for the purpose of bestowing on him a new appellation, Camelford was feigned to be a barony. Mr. Macpherson, the author, editor, or paraphraser of Ossian, represented this borough in several Parliaments. This gentleman made a considerable figure in his day, and excited universal attention, chiefly from his publishing"], [876, "406 LANTKGLOS, JUXTA CAMELFORD. what are called the Poems of Ossian. He is now perhaps best remembered by his correspondence with Doctor Johnson, who argued with the force always exerted by his mighty genius, against the authenticity of this work ; and Mr. Macpherson, probably unable to meet the reasoning, at tempted to establish his case by recurring to a practice almost as obsolete as the achievements of his supposed heroes, which was by reviving the ordeal or wager of bat tle, as the best mode of ascertaining truth ; and with this view, according to the modern phrase, he wrote a chal lenge to Doctor Johnson, and obtained the following answer : \" Mr. James Macpherson, \" I have received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel ; and what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I never shall be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian. WThat would you have me retract ? I thought your book an imposture, and I think so still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the public, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer, are not so formidable ; and what I hear of your morals, inclines me to pay regard, not to what you shall say, but to what you shall prove. \" You may print this if you will. Sam. Johnson.\" The living was held for many years by the Rev. William Phillipps, whom the Editor recollects residing at Camelford, and universally respected for his placid manners and bene volent disposition. A handsome monument has been placed to his memory in the church, by John Phillipps Car penter, Esq. of Mount Tavy, his nephew and devisee, which records his decease on the 20th day of April 1794, aged 7!).

He received the early part of his education at the Merchant-Taylors' School in London, and proceeded from thence to St. John's College, Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship, and took his degree of Doctor in Divinity. But Lombard never assimilated him self to the manners nor the society of England. He spent much time abroad, and especially in Germany, where he became known either to King George the Second, or, what is more probable, as a scholar and a divine to Queen Caroline : from them he obtained this living. In Germany he most fortunately became acquainted also, with a Cornish gentleman, then serving with distinc tion in the army, but distinguished still more by his abilities, learning, and taste. This gentleman (Mr. Gregor) fre quently received Doctor Lombard at Trewarthenick, and carried on with him a correspondence on literary subjects, which is still preserved, and appears to have been his chief friend and main support in a situation of complete banish ment from all other associates of his studies or of his amuse ments; for it appears, from one of his letters, that in former times, he had been admitted a member of what would now be termed a club, with several branches of the reigning family at a German court. All accounts agree in representing Doctor Lombard as a man of profound ecclesiastical and school learning; but at the same time wholly unacquainted with the ways of the world in which he was destined to live, or with the disco veries of modern science. Innumerable anecdotes were current about him half a century ago ; of these two may serve as specimens. He proceeded from London to take possession of his parish, mounted on one horse himself and his servant on another, driving a third laden with such articles as appeared to be indisoensible ir. a country where he supposed nothing"], [878, "408 LANTEGLOS, JUXTA CAMELFORD, could be procured; thus attended, he followed the grea} road, theh'fjassing through Camelford, but inquiring in a foreign accent for Lan-te-glos juxta Camel-ford, he pro ceeded nearly to the Land's End without obtaining the least information as to where his parish lay. The other evinces that he had not condescended to pay any attention to the general classifications of Natural His tory, although Aristotle or Pliny might have communi- cated a sufficient store of knowledge in respect to animals, without his recurring to modern authors. Having observed a hen surrounded by a large brood of chickens, Doctor Lombard expressed his utter astonishment and surprise that so small an animal could possibly afford milk in sufficient quantity for the sustenance of such a numerous offspring. He died at Camelford Dec. 14, 1746 ; and left a valuable library for the use of his successors. This parish measures 3562 statute acres.

The first place of note in this parish is the manor of Hall. Hall signifies a moor, as Mr. Carew truly observes ; and so by its situation it seemeth formerly to have been. This place was for many generations the seat of the Fitz-Wil liams, a family of special note in this county. Gervasius filius Willielmi Fitz-William, held five knights' fees in the reign of Richard the First. Robertus, filius WTillielmi Fitz-William, impotens Miles, Coronator Domini Regis, (Carew, p. 139, Lord Dun stanville's edition, Edw. II. A.D. 1324), an office much regarded in those days.

Sir John Fitz-William, mentioned above, had only one daughter and heir, Elizabeth, married to Reginald de Mo hun, fourth son to John Lord Mohun, of Dunster Castle in Somersetshire, whereof some of his ancestors had been Lords, which John Lord Mohun died in the fourth year of Edward the Third, leaving his grandson John de Mohun his heir ; so that I take John de Mohun, named among the"], [880, "410 LANTEGLOS, JUXTA FOWEY. knio-hts 17 Edward the Second, to be the same with him married to Elizabeth Fitz-William, and the dates agree. They say that this Sir Reginald de Mohun, coming into Fowey harbour with a company of soldiers bound for Ire and, landign there, let fly a hawk at some game, which killed it in the garden of Hall, where Sir John Mohun going for his hawk, and being a very handsome personable young gentleman (qualities which his descendants retained to the lasl) the young lady fell in love with him ; and having a great fortune, the match was soon made up between them by the consent of their friends on both sides. I shall add no more of this place, than that it continued to be the chief seat of the Mohuns till the reign of King Charles the First, when they removed to Boconnock ; some time after which, Warwick Lord Mohun sold the barton only to Mr. Kekewich, whose seat it has been ever since. Peter Kekewich, Esq. his son, took to wife the daughter of Wil liam Williams, of Bodenick ; and dying soon after 1720, left a son, now residing at Hall. The arms of Kekewich are, Argent, two lions in bend passant Sable, cotised Gules. The arms of Fitz-William were, Or, three bends Azure. The manor of Hall continued in the family of Mohun till the general sale to Mr. Pitt; and Mr. Thomas Pitt is the present lord of this manor. Hall, from its pleasant situation, has been called View Hall ; but as this was an addition of latter years, so is it now lost, and the place has returned to its ancient plain name. Mr. Carew hath a long description of the walk here (P. 310), which is still in being, but much neglected; and also of a remarkable fagot, or rather a piece of wood, belonging to the Earls of Devon, and carefully kept here ; but this fagot is, I suppose, now lost. There is but little left of the old house, which I believe was destroyed in the Civil Wars, which may have inclined the Lord Mohun to part with it. Under Hall, and adjoining to it, is Bodenick ; that is,"], [881, "411 LANTEGLOS, JUXTA FOWEY. the house on the water, suitable to its situation. It is but an indifferent place, consisting of one long street on a very steep hill, through which is the highway, and at the bottom of it the passage over the river to Fowey. There is but one good house in the place, and in that the late Mr. William Williams lived, and got a good estate by mer chandizing. The manor of Lamellin, that is the Mill Place, from a mill there, lies on the side of a creek between Bodenick and Polruan. \" At the head of this little Pill,\" says Leland, is a chapel of St. Wilow, and by it is a place called Lamel lin, lately belonging to Lamelin, now to Trelawney by heir general.

There is a popular tradition, that in the year 1644, j ust before the surrender of the infantry commanded by Lord Essex, King Charles the First was walking on the ter race at Hall, described by Mr. Carew, when a shot was fired, which missed him, but killed a fisherman almost by his side. The tradition adds, of course, that the ball was aimed at the King by some one who knew him, but that must be uncertain. Polruan, a place in this parish, having some pretensions still to be called a town, has been wholly omitted by Mr. Tonkin, and probably was so by Mr. Hals, from whose"], [882, "412 LANTEGLOS, JUXTA FOWEY. work the greater part of Mr. Tonkin's manuscript is copied. This place is without doubt of great antiquity ; and seems in former times, when vessels required much less depth of water than they do at present, to have been the principal station in Fowey harbour. Pol means exactly the same as the English word pool, and may possibly be the original theme; Ruan has been ascertained in several in stances to signify Roman. Polruan is, therefore, in all probability, the Roman pool or haven. This place, with a small district round it, forming in some respects a hamlet within the parish of Lanteglos, shared in the elective fran chise of Fowey, where all residents paying scot and lot were entitled to vote till the act of 1832 swept it all away. Tales are related of Polruan having been an inde pendent corporate town, and of its having sent Members to Parliament, while Fowey was a mere village; but such traditions are prevalent in all places under simdar circum stances, and they have not here any sanction whatever from authentic sources.

Two thirds, having passed through different hands by purchase, became the property of Wrey J'Ans, Esq. and have descended to his daughters. The remaining third, with the barton and the advowson of the living, having been for many years in the family of Orchard, now belong to the Reverend F. H. Morrison, heir of the late Mr. Paul Orchard. Tre Yeo, said to have been the ancient seat of the Yeos, is now the property and residence of Robert Kingdon, Esq. The church stands in a vale, about a mile and a half from Stratton. It has a handsome marble altar-piece and several monuments; one of considerable size, and deco- rated, to the memory of John Chamond, who died in 1624. Scarcely any traces are to be seen of Lancells House, the splendid residence of the Chamonds. This parish measures 5610 statute acres.

This parish is situated entirely on the dunstone of the"], [887, "LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. 417 northern parts of Cornwall and Devon ; for a more parti cular account of which, reference has already been given under the head of Boyton. LANCESTON, or LAUNCESTON, ST. MARY MAGDALEN PARISH. HALS. The manuscript relating to Lanceston is lost. TONKIN. Lanceston is situated in the hundred of East, and is bounded to the south by South Pederwyn, as likewise to the west, to the north by St. Thomas, to the east by St. Stephan's and Lawhitton. It is well known that this town and parish took their name from an ancient priory and church here, now demo lished, dedicated to St. Stephan, being called by the Cor nish Lan Stephadon, the church of Stephan. The present church is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, and is not valued in the King's Book. As for what Mr. Carew says, that the Cornish men called it Lesteeven, that is no other than an abbreviation of Lan Stephan. But before I go on with the account of this town and parish, it will be necessary to observe, that, although Nor den (whose authority is indeed of no great weight, even in the description of those things which he had seen himself, and gives draughts of, which for the most part are very erroneous) with many others, call this town, or rather castle, here Dunhevet; yet it is most certain that the ancient town of Dunhevet stood at about half a mile distance to the south-south-west of the present town of Lanceston, in a moorish piece of ground facing the west, at the bottom of vol. n. 2 E"], [888, "418 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. the hill on which Mr. Samuel Line has built his pleasure house and inclosed a bowling-green, (from whence is a a very pretty prospect of the vale under it to the east, and the course of the river Tamar) being parcel of the com mons belonging to the freemen of Lanceston. I went on purpose to view the ruins of the said town this present year 1731, having before this been led aside by the vulgar opinion, of which every boy I found in the town could satisfy me to the contrary. On the place where the said ruins appear are three wells, which I suppose are from the same spring, being pretty close together ; and are, (as 1 take it) the head of that small river which runs by Tres- morrow, Lanleke, Landew, &c. below which it hath a handsome stone bridge, and soon after falls into the Tamar. So that the said town had, in this respect, the advantage of the new one, as being well supplied with water, which is much wanting in this last. By the ruins it doth not ap- pear to have been of very considerable bigness ; though indeed there be no judging well of it, by reason that all the stones of any value have been from time to time carried off to build the present town, and the rest employed to make small inclosures of meadows there. This place sell to decay, I suppose, on William Earl of Morton building a castle, or rather repairing the old one and putting it in the present form, in the beginning ofthe Norman times ; for, by tradition, this castle has been, from remote antiquity, a seat of the Princes of Cornwall. This William Earl of Morton being also Earl of Cornwall by descent from his father Robert, who was half-brother by his mother to William the Conqueror, drew over the in habitants of Dunhevet to this place, by granting great pri vileges to this his chief seat in this county. But before we go on with the history of this town, let us see what Leland, Camden, and Carew say of it. Leland. \u2014 \" After that I had passed over Aterey, I went up by the hill through the long suburbs until I came to the town wall and gate, and so passed through the town, as-"], [889, "LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. 419 cendmg the hill until I came to the very top of it, where be the market-place and the parish church of St. Stephan, lately re-edified. The large and ancient castle of Launceston standeth on the knappe of the hill by south, a little from the parish church. Much of this castle yet standeth ; and the moles that the keep standeth on are large, and of a terrible height ; and the arx of it having three several wards, is the strongest, but not the biggest, that ever I saw in any ancient work in England. There is a little pirle of water that serveth the high part of Launceston. The priory of Launceston standeth in the south-west part of the suburb of the town, under the root of the hill by a fair wood side ; and through this wood runneth a pirle of water coming out of a hill thereby, and serveth all the offices of the place. In the church I marked two notable tombs, one of Prior Horton and another of Prior Ste- phan ; one also told me that Mabilia, a countess, was buried there in the chapter house; one William War- wist, Bishop of Excester, erected this priory, and was afterwards buried at Plympton priory, that he also erected. Warwist, for the erection of Launceston priory, sup- pressed the collegiate church of St. Stephan, having Preben- daries ; and gave the best part of the lands to Launceston priory, and took the residue himself. There yet standeth a church of St. Stephan, about half a mile from Launces ton, on a hill, where the collegiate church was. Gawen Carew hath the custody of the priory. There is also a chapel by west-north-west, a little out of Launceston, de dicated to St. Catharine; it is now profaned.\" So far Leland. Mr. Carew is more particular (p. 274 Lord Dunstan ville's edition). \" Those buildings, commonly known by the name of Launston, and written Lanceston, are by the Cornish men called Lesteevan (Lez in Cornish signifieth broad, and these are scatteringly erected) and were an ciently termed Lanstaphadon, by interpretation Saint Ste phan's Church : they consist of two boroughs, Downe- 2 e 2"], [890, "420 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. vet and Newport; that, perhaps, so called, of down yielding, as having a steep hill ; this, of its newer erection. With these, join the parishes of St. Thomas and St. Ste phan. The parish church of Launceston itself fetches its title of dedication from Mary Magdalen, whose image is curiously hewed in a side wall, and the whole church fairly built. \" The town was first founded, saith Mr. Hooker, by Eadulphus, brother to Alpsius Duke of Devon and Corn wall ; and by its being girded with a wall, argueth in times past to have carried some value. \" A new increase of wealth expressed: itself in the inha bitants' late repaired and enlarged buildings. They are governed by a mayor and his scarlet-robed brethren ; and reap benefit by their fairs and markets, and the county as sizes. The statute of 32d Flenrv VIII. which took order touching sanctuaries, endowed this town with the privilege of one ; but I find it not turned to any use. \" To the town there is adjoinant in site, but sequestered in jurisdiction, an ancient castle, whose steep rocky-footed keep hath its top environed with a treble wall; and in re gard thereof, men say, was called Castle Terrible. The base court compriseth a decayed chapel, a large hall for holding the shire assizes, the constable's dwelling-house, and the common gaol. \" About sixty years past (i. e. about 1540) there were found certain leather coins in the castle wall, whose fair stamp and strong substance till then resisted the assault of time as they would now of covetousness. \u2022' A little without the town were founded a friary, and anno 1128 an abbey, furthered by Reginald Earl of Corn wall.\" Thus far Mr. Carew. Having now done with what former writers have said of this place, I come to give my account of it; and herein I shall begin with"], [891, "LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. 421 THE CASTLE. This is seated to the west-south-west of the town, so that you have a full prospect of it from the western road. Below the wall is a large and deep graff, which formerly sur rounded it, and is still very visible on the western side ; the rest being taken up partly by the highway, and partly by gardens and buildings, which on the eastern side come home along to the castle walls. The westgate is in a man ner all in ruins ; neither are there any remains of the chapel, the hall, or the constable's house, there being now no other building remaining therein but the house which now serveth for the common gaol ; whereas the old one, as the townsmen say, was over the north-east gate, which is still kept in good repair, though no one lives in it. At the north-east end stands the keep, on a high ta- pered mount, which I once thought was artificial, though I am now satisfied to the contrary, there being a quarry of stones almost at the very top of it ; though there has been some art used nevertheless to bring it to the form that it now has. A covered way formerly led you by steps of stone of an easy ascent, to the top of it, which steps are now carried off as well as the roof, and the whole in a ruinous condition ; and truly it moveth compassion to see the woful plight of this so pleasant a seat, accommodated with a fine park, formerly well wooded, with a small rivu- let of water running through it. The whole being now held for lease on lives by Hugh Piper, Esq. who by virtue thereof is likewise constable of the castle and keeper of the gaol, the which was granted to his grandfather Sir Hugh Piper, Knt. together with the lieutenant-governorship of Plymouth by King Charles the Second, as a reward for his sufferings and exemplary bravery in the Civil Wars, in one of the battles during which the said Sir Hugh Piper was left for dead in a field for a whole night; being found the next morning, he was put into a warm bed, and care fully looked to. He lived after this to a good old age, as"], [892, "422 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. may be seen by the inscription on his monument in the church. I had forgotten to say anything of Mr. W'illis's account of this borough, which I shall therefore now insert. Robert Earl of Morton, and his successors Iiarls of Cornwall, having their chief residence at this castle, the town increased much in buildings and riches, and had cer tain privileges and liberties conferred upon it. There were burgesses inhabiting or belonging to the castle of this town in the reign of King Henry the Second, and the reign of King Henry the Third. The town was by its then lord, Richard Earl of Poictiers and of Cornwall, the King's brother,* made a free borough, who granted to it by his char ter, without date, power to choose their own bailiffs, who were to answer the farm of the borough, which was to himself 100/.; to the prior of St. Stephan 65s. lOd. ; and to the lepers of St. Leonard, of Lanceston, 100s. of his alms. He granted them also to erect a guild of merchants in the said borough to hold of him and his heirs, which privi leges (as may be seen by divers charters and letters patent of the Kings of England, reciting by inspeximus) were frequently confirmed, and with additional liberties. And in the 10th year of Richard, the Second, upon the petition of these burgesses, complaining that the last assizes and ses sions had been detained from them and held at Lostwithiel, the King grants that these should be kept no where else in the county of ConrCvall but at Launceston. Thist Prince's father* had, on his being created Duke of Cornwall, inter alia, the castle, borough, and honor of Laun ceston, assigned to him and the heirs of his body, eldest sons of the Kings of England, in whom accordingly this manor has been vested ever since ; and is now held in fee farm by the heir-apparent to the Crown of England, being by birth Duke of Cornwall. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, and eight aldermen, who, with the free burgesses, being in number * King of the Romans. Eo. f The Black Prince. Eo."], [893, "LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. 423 about 130, elect the members of Parliament. Its present establishment of incorporation is owing to a charter of Queen Mary, A. D. 1555. At the last Visitation of the Heralds, held on the 27th of Sept. 1620, the entries were, Thomas Morton, mayor, Sir Anthony Rous, Knt. recor der ; John Genis, Richard Estcot, Arthur Pinard, Nicholas Baker, Hugh Vigures, Henry Cary, George Hext, Or wald Cooke, aldermen ; and Philip King, town clerk. Mr. Willis goes on to say, That this was an ancient market town, may be seen by the Pipe Rolls in King John's time, in whose reign the men of Launceston gave a fine of five marks to change the market from the Lord's Day, whereon it was formerly kept, to Thursday, although it hath since undergone a second alteration, and is now kept on Sa turdays. THE EDITOR. No one can approach Launceston, and more especially from the eastward, without being struck by the magnifi cent remains of the ancient castle. Mr. Edward King, in the third volume of his Muni menta Antiqua, treats much at large of the fortresses erected in remote times throughout Cornwall ; and he par ticularly dwells on this at Launceston, assigning to it the most remote antiquity on account of its not bearing any resemblance to castles built by the Romans, Saxons, Danes, or Normans, and from its agreement with various of the Ph\u0153nician, Syrian, and Median castles, and especially with those in Asia Minor. Mr. King says, the keep (unlike all Norman keeps) in stead of being of great diameter and spacious, is very small, although there was evidently space enough on the top of the rock to have made it as large as Norman magnificence could demand, had it been erected, as some have hastily conjec tured, by that people. It is only eighteen feet and a half"], [894, "424 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. in diameter within, and it is quite round. On the con trary, Trematon, in the same county, which may with good reason be concluded to have been built by Robert Earl of Morton, is a true Norman structure ; and there cannot be a greater contrast than there is between it and Launces ton. Like Tunbridge castle, it is placed, not on a high natural rock, but on an artificial mound, and is no les than sixty feet in diameter on the inside. See Dr. Borlase's Antiquities, 2d ed. p. 354. The wall of the keep at Launceston is exceedingly strong, being at least ten feet thick ; and within its thickness is a staircase, ascending up from one side of the passage of the doorway, without any winding, excepting that of the mere curvature ofthe wall itself. The present height is thirty-two feet, the upper part being somewhat broken down; and it contained, as its only apartments, a sort of dungeon on the ground, which had no light at all, and two rooms over it, one above the other. The lowermost of these, or the room immediately above the dungeon, was nearly as dismal and dark as the dungeon itself, and appears obviously, therefore, to have been intended merely to be used as a place for store, or a sort of treasury ; but in the uppermost apartment there appear to have been two large windows (now broken down) commanding a most extensive view, one to the east and another to the west; and also a fire-hearth, with a passage for the smoke carried up through the thickness of the wall towards the north, all which plainly indicate this room to have been intended as a sort of state apartment for the actual residence of the chieftain. Such is this tower ; and its close surrounding works are no less extraordinary, for we find it encompassed by a se cond munition still stronger than itself. About six feet, or a little more, from its outside, is an encircling wall twelve feet thick, and nearly equal in height with the floor of the uppermost apartment of all. Beyond this second wall is again a second surrounding"], [895, "LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. 425 area in like manner with the first, only six feet wide, and which was further inclosed by a third encircling wall, form ing a sort of parapet. Beyond all these was an external wall with a deep ditch. Mr. King then goes on to compare this castle with an cient descriptions of those in the east, and satisfies himself of their identity. Respecting the name, Dun or Doon, is unquestionably a hill, and thence derivatively a fortress ; but no plausible conjecture has been formed in regard to the second syl lable. A similar observation may be made respecting the name of the town. Lan occurs as a prefix, in the sense of indi cating a church, eleven times in Cornwall ; but it seems dif ficult to derive \" ceston\" from Stephan. Yet if the Cel tic pronunciation of Stephan was really Staveton, Lan staveton may have easily glided, through Saxon pronun ciation and misapprehension of the terminating syllable into Lanceston. The priory of Launceston appears to have been a foun dation of no small magnitude. The list of its possessions, in the Augmentation Office, exhibit a considerable revenue; and Leland describes its church with handsome, monu ments : not a trace remains. No one more sincerely rejoices at the downfall of superstition, originating in ages of darkness, than the Editor of this work, and above all at the approach ing annihilation throughout Europe of monastic institu tions, promised by the regular and steady current of events; but the sudden and indiscriminating devastations ofthe six teenth century, sweeping every thing before them like whirl winds, destroying for the mere sake of wanton destruction, or at the very best \u2014 from a desire of obliterating all former remembrances ; these stamp on the mind very different im pressions ; and when it is felt that the storm was urged for wards by the fury of an individual, by the avarice of those occupying the highest stations, and by the purposely inflamed passions of the multitude, it is impossible not"], [896, "426 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. to experience the forebodings of Scipio on the fall of Car thage ; and to exclaim with him TLarrerat iifJ-ap brav ttot oXwXjj IXioy ip-q, Kai npto/ios, Kai Xaos ev/ieXtw Xlpta/xow. The registers and cartularies of this monastery have dis appeared ; for these were systematically destroyed. Frag ments, however, exist in ancient transcripts; some, for merly in the possession of William Griffith, and referred to by Bishop Tanner, are now preserved in the Lansdowne Collection. Among these the following document may be found relative to the foundation of the priory by William Warlewast, Bishop of Exeter, from 1150 to 1159: \u2014 Noscat pr\u00e6sentis temporis \u00e6tas, quod Radulfus Ecclesi\u00e6 sanct1 Stephani de Launcestone decanus decanatum mihi Wil lielmo Episcopo reddidit.

Launceston, defended by its Acropolis, and important as a frontier town, probably remained in all respects the capital of Cornwall so long as that little state retained its separate existence. Lestwithiel afterwards became the residence of its nominal Earls, took from Launceston the sheriffs' court, and acquired the technical appellation of the county town. The assizes, however, continued at Launceston, and the quarter sessions were opened there ; and then, for the convenience of the western population, adjourned to Truro. Here also was the only county gaol ; till at last the incon venience and expense became so great, that about the year 1780, a new, extensive, and commodious gaol, with every recent improvement, was constructed at Bodmin, where the summer assizes had been removed under the authority of an act of Parliament 1st Geo. I. c. 45, ren dered necessary by the charter of King Richard II. But Launceston, only two miles from the boundary of Cornwall, and so remote from the mining districts, which comprehend the great masses of population and of litigible property, as to render a journey there in one day impos sible, has been long considered wholly unfitted for the hold ing of any court having jurisdiction thoughout the county ; while on the other hand judges and counsel feared to extend their winter's progress over the bad roads and hills of Cornwall. The roads are now improved, and the hills are avoided; and in this year (1834) an order has been made for holding both assizes in future at the town adja cent to the prison, nearly in the centre of the county, and where an increased inducement will be afforded for pro viding the accommodation requisite on such occasions. Launceston itself has received more improvement than almost any other place as a thoroughfare ; the great London road crossing it from east to west, and one of considerable importance from north to south. The exit from the east gate was about ten years ago made safe, and even convenient, from being dangerous in a very high degree; and in the present year (1834) a road from the north"], [902, "432 LANCESTON, OR LAUNCESTON. has been wound round the castle at a very easy ascent, and avoided altogether a hill so steep as almost to prohibit the use of wheeled carriages. Launceston not only sent two Members to Parliament; but the long street, or suburb extending from the foot of the hill at the north gate, sent two members more under the name of Newport. By the act of Parliament of 1832, they are both included in a district, returning one member. Launceston is so amply described by recent writers of the county history, that it would be useless to repeat what they have given. The general view of the place is mag nificent ; and especially from the new iron bridge, com pleted this year, across the Tamar at Polston.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. Doctor Boase observes on the geology, that clayslate, calcareous schist, limestone, andother rocks belonging to the calcareous series, constitute the substrature of this parish. It is quite obvious that the conical mound supporting the keep, as well as the whole extent of the bass court, are composed of eminences favourable for defence but im proved by art, being scarped in some places and elevated in others.
