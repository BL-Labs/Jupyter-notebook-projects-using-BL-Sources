This description of Hants is an independent work, intended to do equal justice to all the places, features, and interests in the county. For the accomplishment of this object, I have personally collated the documents, and visited the localities ; and I have done my best to make the work original, inviting, and useful ; though, from its nature it cannot be quite free, either from omissions or mistakes. The plates and maps, the former of which are unprecedented in number in any"], [14, "PREFACE. VI work of the kind, are all original, and executed expressly for the general benefit of the work, without reference to the pleasure of a single individual. Thus the work is especially \" the Book of Hampshire ;\" but from the fact that the En glish kingdom began in Hampshire, which was the metro politan county for three centuries, and that it is assuming a more national interest from the projected union of the Thames and the Southampton Water, by means of the Docks at the latter port, and the Railway, it must be interesting to the British public generally. In arranging the work into volumes, chapters, and sec tions, I have thought best to take those physical divisions which have been made by nature, and are obvious to every one's observation, rather than the artificial divisions which have no foundation in nature ; and which thus mean nothing and explain nothing, farther than can be found in the Map and its tabulary appendices. Some may think that I have been rather sparing in the minute details of particular places ancl objects. But these details are the province of the local guide-books ; and my object was not to make a servile compilation from these ; but to produce an original work, which should contain mat ters not to be found in any other; and which, while it gave the fullest and clearest account of its particular sub ject, should be a real addition to the library.

CHAP. I. GENERAL INTRODUCTION. Works illustrative of single counties are sometimes styled \" County Histories;\" but the name is objectionable, inasmuch as it leads the reader to expect what it cannot possibly con- tain. In order that there may be a history, there must be some leading subject, the progress of which can be traced through a series of successive events, following each other from the earliest period of which any information is recorded, down to that at which the history closes. Such a subject is furnished by an independent state, or city or town, or even a single human being ; but a county is not an historical sub ject, it is a part of the general country ; and, however important it may be in itself, and whatever may be the events of which it has been the scene, its history merges in the gene- ral history of the country, and cannot be treated separately. The common and more appropriate name, shire, that is scyre \u2014 a share or portion, of itself points out that such is VOL. I. B"], [18, "2 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. the case. It is true that, in times long gone by, many local districts of England were, both in the soil and in the inha bitants, under the domination of counts, earls, or other feudal lords ; and that, if these lords performed the stipulated ser vice to the monarch, they were allowed to exercise very plenary powers over the property, the liberties, and lives of their vassals. But, fortunately for England, those times and their customs have passed away, and all the more valuable parts of the constitution are under the general government of the country, and alike free, for protection and necessary restraint, to the inhabitants of every shire. Admitting there fore, that some districts of England may once have been feudal possessions, to an extent, nearly or altogether coincident with the modern shires or counties, and may have had local histories while this system lasted, there is none of them which has such a history reaching back to the earliest au thentic records, or which can be connected with the present state of the county, or be said to have had very much influ ence in bringing about its present condition. Hampshire especially, notwithstanding the very important place which it holds in the early history of England, and its modern beauty, agricultural richness, and salubrious cli mate, has no individual or detached history, even for a short period of time. Consequently, if we were to attempt to found our Description of Hampshire upon an historical basis, the attempt would be a failure ; and the result of our labours would be, like that of most works of similar title, a collection of scraps, without any connecting principle, or general lesson of instruction. But, though there be no subject of connected history in a county, by means of which unity can be given to a description of that country, either as it appears to present observation, or as it has been brought to the state in which we observe it, there is a much more permanent bond of connection than can be obtained in any history whatever \u2014 there is the county itself. Men, and races, and nations, pass away in the na tural course of events \u2014 as we find strikingly exemplified in"], [19, "3 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. every county, and in none more than in this ; but, though counties change in the lapse of years, both from natural causes and from human operations, the land itself is proof against the utmost extreme of surface-action, and yields only to those mightier movements of nature, whereby exhausted islands and continents are gathered to their tombs in the deep, and new lands are upheaved by the working of that giant power wherewith the Almighty has endowed matter, for the performance of those more sublime purposes of his will, of which the solid globe itself is the only record, and the principles of which lie far beyond the scope of human philosophy; while, compared to the periods of their single revolutions, the entire period of human history is but as a moment. Thus, the proper foundation upon which to rest a descrip tion of any part of the earth, is more stable as well as more sublime, than any upon which the history of man can be grounded ; and therefore, wherever there is an apparent want of connection between the individual subjects of description, we can always find in the physical existence of the land we describe, a means of uniting them together, and making them, in so far, mutual interpreters of each other. This, in a great measure, determines the object of a county description, as well as points out the means by which that description may be rendered both accurate and useful. The object naturally is, to point out the present state of the county, to notice the means by which it has been brought to this state, and to glance at the future changes, especially the changes for the better, of which it may be susceptible. The present state is a matter of simple observation ; but the causes of that state, and the future prospects, are subjects involving more difficulty, so that they require a nice and discriminating analysis ; and after all, they often involve so many indeterminate elements, that the results at which we arrive are little better than mere conjectures. Not only this ; but, if we take the most permanent portion of the whole subject, namely, the form of the surface, the soil, and b2"], [20, "4 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. the climate, these act so reciprocally upon each other, that we are, in many cases, unable to say which is the cause and which the effect. Farther, we are unable to begin at the beginning, as the country must be formed before it can be described, \u2014 and how long before we have no evidence. Still, this is a very important branch of the subject, and the only one by means of which the many details which a county presents can be so generalized as to be either plea sant for reading or useful for instruction. The first of these is desirable, because it recommends the second ; but the second is the grand point, inasmuch as the inhabitants of a county, or any district, town, or other place, cannot direct their efforts in the most profitable manner, without some knowledge of the natural advantages and disadvantages of their locality. The want of this knowledge is the cause of very frequent labour in vain, and consequent disappointment and disheartening; so that people neglect those improvements of which their locality is susceptible, in consequence of fail ing in attempted ones for which it is ill-suited. That mankind always work to more advantage, in propor tion as the natural circumstances in which they are placed work more in unison with them, is so plain a truth, that the mere statement of it is in itself a demonstration ; but, not withstanding this, we have abundant evidence in almost every locality, that this plain truth is overlooked. Hampshire may be adduced as an instance : there once were, in different parts of the county, considerable manufactories of goods for the general market ; but, though these flourished in the early times of manufacturing, they began to decline with a rapidity nearly proportional to that of the general improve ment of similar manufactories in other districts ; and they are now nearly extinct. It would, however, be absurd to argue from this, that the people of Hampshire are less capa ble of this sort of employment than those of other counties ; for, besides the general equality in point of talent of the in habitants of all parts of England, the record of history shows that this county, if not the very first, was yet among"], [21, "5 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. the first, within the four seas, in which many of those ma nufactures, which now flourish so much in other places, were originally established, either by introduction or by native invention. This single point furnishes us with one impor tant conclusion, namely, that it would be unwise to attempt the introduction into Hampshire of any extensive manufac ture for supplying the general commerce of the world ; and that, consequently, the inhabitants ought to employ their means and turn their attention to other subjects. This simple instance will serve to point out what ought to be the leading object of a county-description, in so far as the substantial well-being of the inhabitants of that county is concerned. This, however, must be done by inference rather than by argument, inasmuch as a disquisition on the means of bettering a county, with what abilities soever it might be written, would have few popular attractions, and indeed few readers of any description. But here, the de scriber of a county possesses some advantages over most other describers, which render his success easier, and his failure more reprehensible. In the first place, he has nature as a constant resource \u2014 in the fields, the floods, the skies, in the mineral strata, the rotation of the seasons, and the action and repose of the vegetable and the animal tribes. In the second place, he has all that man has done or is doing to produce the present aspect of things, whether in rural district or in town, for use or for ornament, for private ad vantage or public improvement. In the third place, he has the advantage of every thing which history records, from the barely perceptible barrow on the down, which contains the dust of a forgotten race, to the last event of which the coun ty he describes has been the scene ; and by what means, or in what manner soever, those historical events may be recorded. In respect of these three means of resource, and especially of the last of them \u2014 though the others are possessed in no stint ed degree, Hampshire is more advantageously circumstanc ed than most counties. As a portion of England, its records"], [22, "6 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. extend farther back than those of most other places ; for a long and interesting period it stood high-foremost indeed in national importance ; and the numbers and interest of its me morials correspond. Thus, there is the most ample scope for relieving the tediousness of the present by a reference to the past, and for enlivening the past by contrast with the present. Such are the objects of this work, and such, in general terms, are the subjects, by the treatment of which those ob jects are to be accomplished; and the next consideration is how these subjects are to be treated with the requisite mi nuteness of detail, and yet, in something like a natural con nexion \u2014 a connexion which the reader can generalize, and thus, either learn, or refresh his memory, according as the case may be. The first point to be considered is the locality of the county, because this determines many of its relative advantages as compared with other counties. The second point is the general aspect of the county, as resulting from its physical characters, and the improvements which have been made upon it. The third point is a general view of its physical characters ; and these admit of many sub-divisions, the whole of which cannot be named, far less described, in a general intro duction. The present state, and the future prospects, cannot be enlarged upon as general points distinctly referable to the whole county ; for they are local matters, and as such belong to the details. The fifth point, and the last which we shall state in the introduction, is the order in which the several parts of the county are to be considered. For this there is no absolute rule, though there is one course more desirable than any other. This course is the selection of such an order of succession as shall be grounded upon permanent characters, which may make transitions from place to place natural and easy, and which shall, in as far as possible, an swer the purpose of an artificial memory, and render one part of the work, in some degree, an index to the other parts. No order which can be adopted in this, can be free from objec-"], [23, "7 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. tions, as it is a matter of taste, upon which not only the au thor and the reader, but every two readers who think for themselves, are likely to differ. LOCALITY OF HAMPSHIRE. The situation of Hampshire gives it many natural advan- tages, of a kind which are peculiarly applicable to society in its simpler or early stages. This may have been one of the chief reasons why this county was so soon visited and colonized by foreigners ; and was cultivated, and carried on a foreign commerce, while many other parts of the Island were comparatively in a state of nature. It is nearly on the mid- dle of the south coast of England, being about 100 miles west from Dover, and 150 east of Land's End. It is thus equally protected from the strong winds both from the east and the west, the first of which \u2014 and they are the most injuri- ous to spring vegetation, seldom reach in even to the eastern boundary of this county. Its land boundaries are, Sussex and Surrey on the east, Berks on the north, and Wilts and Dor- set on the west ; but the boundaries are very irregular, there being patches of Hampshire in the adjoining counties, and patches of some of these mixed with the other where they join Hampshire. Though the general inclination of the surface is southward to the sea, the north and north eastern parts of the county incline in the other direction ; and thus give it a communication, both by the rivers, which have their sources in it, and by the heights which divide their valleys, with the valley of the Kennet and the Thames, and through them with all the rich country between and adjacent to the tide ways of the Thames estuary and the Bristol channel. Thus, by means of its situation, Hampshire has at once a maritime and a central position. Winchester, its capital city, is equally distant from Bristol on the western estuary and London on the eastern ; it is very nearly 60 miles from each, and only 12 from the tide-way of the port of Southampton, the best general harbour in the county as adapted to its lo cality. From Oxford, Winchester is only 38 miles distant,"], [24, "8 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. and Southampton of course, only 50. These measures are but approximations, taken on the straight line, and stated in round numbers, \u2014 as the object is not to show the measure ment of the lines of actual communication, but merely the position of the county and the advantages which it derives from this position. Winchester is nearly central ; for, though upon its own parallel it is 18 miles from the eastern border of the county, and about 14 from the western, it is nearly in the middle of the longest line, which crosses from the borders of Dorset on the sea-coast north-eastward, to where Berks and Surrey meet on the confines of Hampshire. This diagonal is about 65 miles in length, lies wholly across the land, and Winchester is 30 miles from its north-eastern extremity. These circumstances are of importance, as shewing how convenient and commanding the position of the county was at the time when England, south of the Thames, formed a grand division of the Island. This advantage is a natural one ; and as long as the principal wealth of the country con sisted in the productions of the soil, and in manufactures car ried on by manual labour, without the assistance of those means, of which fire, and of course fuel, form so essential a part, it maintained its ascendancy. If that ascendancy is now lost in these matters, it only shows that the natural re sources of Hampshire are not such as adapt it to the present character of the staple manufactures of the country ; and this ought naturally to direct the attention of its inhabitants to those pursuits which it is most advisable either to follow or to avoid. There is one other circumstance which is worthy of atten tion, as showing how well this county is adapted for a com munication by the sea, and that is the vast length of its sea coast. Taken on the straight line, from the border of Dorset on the west, to that of Sussex on the east, the coast of the mainland of Hampshire does not much exceed 40 miles ; but if we include the Isle of Wight, which, as an integrant part of the county, ought to be included, an estimate of the whole shore, including both banks of the navigable bays, estuaries,"], [25, "9 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. and creeks, the line of coast exceeds 200 miles in length, which is hardly exceeded by that of any county in England, \u2014 indeed we may say it is not equalled. It is farther worthy of remark, that the greater portion of this long extent of coast is embayed and sheltered, free from rocks, and quite safe for such vessels as can find depth of water. The banks, or tidal beaches, often extend to a great distance within high water mark ; but, the mid-channels, have sufficient depth for the largest vessels, the bottom is good anchorage in most places, and the banks are of the safest character. The ave rage rise of tide is about ten or eleven feet ; and the half tides, which give much facility to the arrival and departure of small vessels, vary from about four to about six feet, ac cording to circumstances. Indeed the greater part of the shores is approachable, with safety, by small craft, in most states of the weather, though the banks render it necessary to erect long piers for the accommodation of vessels of bur den, unless in the bays and estuaries. There is no reason to doubt that, in early times, the safe and inviting character of the waters attracted those foreign ers, who effected landings, and, in succession, claimed the country as their own. This is not the place for entering into the details, but still we may notice in passing, that there are two principal bays or estuaries, with many ramifications and smaller ones. The eastern one has an extent toward the sea of between six and seven miles, including islands, and the average extent inland is about five miles. The en trances are three : the eastern one, which leads to Chiches ter harbour, about a quarter of a mile; the middle one, and the western one at Portsmouth, both nearly the same. The first and second are separated by Hayling Island, and the second and third by the Island of Portsea. Ofthe channels formed by these two islands, the most commodious for shipping is the western one, at Portsmouth, upon which also was situated the Roman station of Portchester, which, as was the case with most of the marine stations of that people, had its situation far ther from the sea than the modern station for the British navy. VOL. I. *B"], [26, "10 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. The principal water for intercourse with the county, and the one to which both visiters and invaders appear to have resorted most frequently in ancient times, seems, however, to have been the Southampton Water, from which there are direct openings into the centre of the country, by the valleys of the Itchen and Test ; whereas Portsdown Hill extends like a barrier, at a short distance north of the bays and harbours in the south-east part of this county. It is highly probable that the name of the county has been derived from that of the Southampton estuary, and the principal stream which flows into it, which is indiscriminately called the Test and the Anton. In this matter, \" Southamp tonshire\" must not be confounded with \" Hampshire,\" or its contraction, \" Hants ;\" for, the former is the name of the small district forming the county or parliamentary liberty of the town of Southampton, and is of obvious etymology, and comparatively modern application ; whereas the former is li terally the shire, or \" share\" of land, lying upon, or approach able by, the Anton water ; and, in early times, was denominated Antonshire or Hantonshire, different in the spelling from the modern word, but having exactly the same signification. The position and extent of the Isle of Wight, which lies as a guard between the Hampshire waters and the swell and violence of the Channel, occasioned by the roll of the Atlan tic, render these waters peculiarly safe as compared with the other parts of the south coast, both to the east and to the west, more especially the former \u2014 the coast of Sussex being as much exposed as that of Hampshire is protected. A farther protection against the roll of the Channel, both from the east and the west, but more especially from the former, is afforded by the projections of the adjacent shores; and this protection is greatest on the west, whence the most violent winds, and consequently the most heavy swells, pro ceed. Any one who glances at the outline of the south coast of England on the map, will readily understand this. There are four principal projections, \u2014 the Lizard, in Corn wall ; Start Point, in Devon ; and the Bill of Portland, and"], [27, "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. 11 St. Aldham's Head, in Dorset; to the eastward of each of which a deep bay is formed. The general set of the tide is up the Channel, and in addition to the common friction of shore, which in all cases retards a tide flowing parallel to it, these projecting points lay hold of the tidal wave, and retain it so long as to produce the double tide, by a second high water partially returning before the first and principal one has ebbed away. The action of those tides may be seen, from the mud-banks which they have produced by throwing back the sediment of the rivers against the shores. Westward of the Isle of Wight, and on the southern side of that island, the banks are comparatively trifling ; but eastward of Hurst Castle, which is on the point of a natural causeway, opposite the western extremity of the Isle of Wight, there is an ex tensive deposit on the shore of the New Forest division of Hampshire ; and throughout the whole of the narrow waters, the general set of the tides, and the eddies which they form, may be judged of by the banks which have accumulated. Fully to understand the motion of the waters here, would however, require an induction of more particulars than can be admitted into an introductory sketch, and the subject is so important toward forming a correct knowledge of the natural causes of the early notice which Hampshire attracted, that we shall afterwards advert to it as a principal subject. PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF HAMPSHIRE. These characters, fully investigated, would form no incon siderable part of the description of the county ; but, as they will recur more in detail, when we come to treat of the several localities, we shall notice them very briefly, and blend that notice with a passing glance at the natural ap pearances. Next to its position, in latitude, and in reference to other lands and the sea, the geological structure of any tract of country is the most important of its physical charac ters ; because this determines the form of the surface, the nature of the soil, and the native plants and animals ; and has very considerable influence upon the cultivation of the ground, c2"], [28, "12 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. and the occupations, and partially also upon the character, of the people. Hampshire is wholly composed of aqueous formations, and this circumstance precludes the possibility of there being any thing either sublime or picturesque in its scenery; nor can we expect to find in it any of those spots of extreme fertility which are met with in countries where the composition of the strata is more varied, and their formation is the result of more violent causes. Swelling hills, alternating with val leys and hollows, occupy the greater part of the surface, and though the outlines are often beautiful, they are always tame. This tameness, however, is much more favourable to general cultivation, than if the outlines were of a more bold and striking character ; and it is matter of common observation, that a country which is generally susceptible of cultivation by man, is equally productive of timber-trees when in a state of nature. The modern appearance and the ancient account of Hampshire agree with each other in the etablishment of this. Much of the surface is at present under culture, and there is hardly a spot in it which might not be cultivated, and probably which has not been at some time under crop ; and the ancient accounts agree in stating, that the whole was once one continued forest, thickly set, even upon those parts which are now turfy downs with only here and there a stunted bush. This is, and this was probably the case, whatever the sub-strata may be, \u2014 whether chalk, or gravel, or clay, which, in one or other of their forms, may be said to make up the entire strata of the country without the least appearance of any volcanic action, or the possession of a single metallic vein. The nature of the principal elevations, or summit-levels, which divide the waters in the county, is such that the rain is either thrown entirely off the surface, or it finds its way so deep into the earth, and is so scattered by the looseness of the gravel, or the fissures ofthe chalk \u2014 where that formation is broken into angular fragments, that no spring of water can come out near the summits, nor are there any of those under-ground runs of water, which in countries"], [29, "13 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. having disturbed strata, often pour out a considerable stream by a single opening. Thus the greater part of the county is without any great appearance of water on the surface ; and there is no possibility of intersecting it by a navigable canal, as there is no supply of water at the summii>level, and, with out this, no such means of communication can be made available. The other physical circumstances of Hampshire are of course in accordance with its locality, and with those which have been hinted at. The chief action of the atmosphere is an alternation between the sea and the land ; and the minor action is between the valleys and the downs by which these are separated. There is less evaporation from the entire county than if that abounded more in streams, with lakes in the up- lands, or than if there naturally were a rank herbage upon the surface ; but the moisture which is upon the surface, or alternately there and in the atmosphere, is kept in a state of great activity ; and, by this means, it probably contributes more to vegetable action, and more especially to healthy ve- getable action, and is also more favourable to animal life, than if the supply were more abundant, even admitting that that supply did not stagnate upon the surface, or tend in any way to the production of noxious miasmata. The dry downs of Hampshire never become so cold as those marshy heights upon which water stagnates ; and therefore, both summer and winter, they are more obedient to the action of the sun. When the sun rises, evaporation is rapid ; and when the sun sets, the atmospheric moisture is speedily condensed into dew upon the surface. The consequence is, that, even in weather which is generally settled, the little local winds are incessantly at work, in a manner highly favourable to vegetation, although they are at the same time not only viewless, but almost imperceptible in their motions. The effects of these are far more beneficial than they who have not attended to the principles of surface and atmosphe ric action, and the reciprocal stimulation which they give to each other, would be apt to suppose. An observant stranger"], [30, "14 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. from a land of lakes and streams would be apt to look upon it as an especial marvel, and to doubt, if he did not actu ally observe it, that in Hampshire, there should be miles of alternating swell and hollow, in every direction covered with fine herbage or waving rich with crops of corn, without the slightest vestige of a rill of water, and in a climate which, though there are occasionally very heavy rains, is upon the whole dry rather than otherwise. But in this county, and in such other parts of the south of England as resemble it in position and in circumstances, there is a most harmonious tuning of the earth, the air, and the genial in fluence of the sun, which produces a species of fertility, far more healthy, both for animal and for vegetable life, than can exist where any of these three elements is in excess or deficient. The valleys of the rivers, where there are such, the rich woods of the parks and forests, which supply the place of the valleys where there are none, the bottoms be tween the swells or downs, and the fields under artificial crop, all preserve a considerable uniformity of temperature night and day, during the dry and warm weather. The more open and exposed places, on the other hand, are subject to considerable fluctuations of temperature, and the more so the greater the heat and drought. These little local winds play between dell and down morning and evening, something in the same manner, though not to the same extent, as the sea and land breezes upon tropical and other shores, where the sea and land work to each other. During the day, the local motion of the atmosphere is from the dell, the wood, the corn-field, or the other comparatively humid surface, to the dry and open place, at which time, the evaporation is so powerful, that, if the observer is in a favourable situation, it appears to play along the horizon like smoke ; and as the air which comes to such places, whether in a perceptible wind or not, brings moisture along with it, this evaporation continues until the day is pretty far spent. But as the sur face, especially the chalky downs, is reflective, when the sun begins to get low, its beams are thrown up into the atmos-"], [31, "15 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. phere, and the surface cools with considerable rapidity, so that dews begin to form at or immediately after sun-set, while the air, at a small elevation above the surface, still re tains the influence of the solar heat. This partially evapo rates the first formed dew, and the compound action of forming and dissolving increases the cold, condenses the atmosphere, diminishes its capacity for moisture, collects a heavy dew upon the surface, and leaves a cold air to descend into the lower humid places, much more dry than that which comes from such places during the day. This local action has no thing to do with the general winds or motions of the atmos phere, the law of which is nearly the same over the whole county ; but, unless the wind blows pretty strongly, the lo cal action is not suspended by it, and vegetation is kept up where, but for this local action, the surface would be parched, and vegetation destroyed during the rains. This result often happens in the turnip fields during the early growth of these plants ; but it is more rare on the corn and the grasses, es pecially the clovers, which are naturally favourites upon a soil and in situations, where a pasture natural gramine\u00e6, would be long in forming, and the surface would be worn and wasted, by the action of the winter following upon the result of the summer exposure. These are some of the physical circumstances of the County of Hants ; and from them the observant reader will readily be able to draw his own conclusions as to the general aspect of the county, both in a state of nature, and as improved by culture. Such a conclusion cannot however be exactly ap- plied to any one district ; but must be different, according as the soil is chalk, or clay, or gravel, \u2014 according to the form and elevation of its surface, \u2014 according to its distance from the sea, or the more lofty elevations, \u2014 and according as it is more or less covered with wood, or under crops of grain, legumes, or clovers, the last two of which especially attract and retain humidity, and tend in every way to the improve ment of the soil, during the summer months. Hence the full elucidation of the principles embodied in these remarks"], [32, "16 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. must, like that of most other matters, be left to the local notices ; but this preliminary enunciation of the general principles will save much repetition, which otherwise would be indispensable. The circumstances of which we have now endeavoured to give a brief outline, determine the general character of Hamp shire, and also the leading occupation of its people, if these people are to make the proper use of their local advantages, and not to struggle to obtain that which they cannot accom plish without a loss, which, in spite of all the benefits which nature has conferred on them, would place them in a lower condition than their fellow-countrymen. The grand inference, and that which involves all the rest as minor parts or local modifications, is, that the chief wealth, we may almost say the only wealth, of Hampshire, is in its soil ; that it is, properly and substantially, an agricultural county ; and that, in proportion as it should attempt to depart from this character, it would leave its vantage-ground, and maintain an ineffective and ruinous struggle with places better suited for manufacturing or for commerce. There is no doubt that agricultural implements, and many essentials for household purposes, may be more advantageously made within the county ; and that the materials for building are, in most places, readily to be obtained, and of good quality. It is also true that some manufactures, the raw materials of which are not produced within the county, may be carried on to a limited extent with advantage. But it does not appear that, \u2014 with the exception of ships framed of its native timber, of which the supply is equally abundant and excellent, and for the building of which many of its creeks are admirably fitted, and cordage and apparel for such ships, \u2014 any manu facture, with a view to extensive export, can ever be esta blished in the county, or extensively tried without occasioning the certain ruin of whoever may undertake it. Even this manufacture \u2014 the only one for which a heavy and expensive material is produced in the county, labours under a disad vantage. Extensive ship-building is part and parcel of an"], [33, "17 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. extensive commerce, so that upon the whole it is better to construct ships at ports where there is a great trade, even though not a single material used in the manufacture is pro duced in the neighbourhood, than it is to build them where there are materials but no trade. The reason is obvious : there is no cargo for the vessel on her first trip ; a ship must be able to carry a cargo nearly equal to its own weight ; a ship is more expensive in transporting than a cargo ; and, therefore, it is cheaper to carry the materials to a place where a ship shall be in demand the instant it is finished, than it is to conduct the finished ship in ballast. These remarks do not apply to government ships, because these are not in tended to make a profit by cargoes ; and thus the southern coasts of Hampshire are well adapted for the building of such ; but this is a war manufacture ; and, like all manufac tures of the kind, though profitable while the war lasts, it falls off, and is the cause of decline and suffering, when that peace comes, by means of which those parts of the country that are in a natural condition, and following those courses which are most permanently advantageous, are working to repair that general loss which a country always sustains, in a pecuniary way at least, very much in proportion to the extent, the duration, and even the glory of a modern inter national warfare. The consideration of this particular case is absolutely necessary to a right understanding of the pre sent condition* of the coast towns of Hampshire, which increased so much in size, in population, and in wealth, during the late war, but which are now in a state of suffer ing or decline. It may also be useful in the way of pre caution, by preventing the attempt to build a system of permanent prosperity, upon a foundation which is casual, unnatural, and not to be desired. We find the corroboration of this, in those parts of the county which did not participate in the temporary, and we may add, unnatural prosperity occasioned by the war. For tunately, for the general welfare of the county, the effect alluded to was local ; and though agricultural Hampshire c"], [34, "18 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. felt, in common with the rest of England, the effects of the transition from war to peace, and must, in part, feel every general calamity or reverse, commercial or otherwise, yet it has been, and now is, in a state of moderate but sure im provement, both in the number, and the wealth and comfort of its people. Hasty strides in this way are not to be expected; because an agricultural people, whatever may be their skill or their industry, must ever take nature along with them ; and \u2014 -as the seasons, and circumstances far more limited and local in their causes than the seasons, cannot be controlled by human skill, there is a certain slow and sure degree, be yond which, if the agriculturist attempts to force matters, he gets into an unnatural state, and falls backwards in prac tice, how much soever he may flatter himself that he is ad vancing in theory. Of this there are many instances in the case of speculative farmers, especially such as speculate without a practical knowledge of the art, and particularly of those natural agents which must co-operate with man in rendering that art successful ; and such instances will natu rally occur to any one who knows and takes an interest in the subject \u2014 a subject of much importance to England ge nerally, and to the county of Hants in particular. So far as modern circumstances \u2014 circumstances to the operation of which we can look in steady and pacific times, are considered, what has been above stated contains the prin ciples of the present state of Hampshire, and also of its general and most essential improvement in times to come. The operation of the several elements of this principle, as dependent upon nature and upon man, are so much diver sified in the different localities of the county, that they can not be generalized ; and therefore we must content ourselves with a very rapid glance at the aspect, or general appearance of the county. ASPECT OF HAMPSHIRE. Beauty and variety are the leading features of this part of England, though in many places the first of these is"], [35, "19 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. much diminished by the absence of water. In other respects, its landscapes are often of very pleasing character; and, leaving out of view the picturesque and the sublime, they are not excelled by any in England, or indeed in any other country. Many of the mansions are large, tastefully built, and judiciously placed ; and the grounds about them are dis posed and planted in a very appropriate manner ; but still quietness and repose are the leading characters of the whole of them, in consequence of which, the very finest mansions in Hampshire are rural \u2014 have the aspect of retreats from the bustle of the active world \u2014 they express enjoyment and happiness. The country-dwellings, indeed, form a regular and a very pleasant series, from the most stately abode to the humblest cottage. Throughout every class, the dwelling not only harmonizes well with the situation; but accords with and expresses the condition of its inhabitant. After we descend a little in the scale of magnitude, the houses, the farm buildings, the cottages, and most of the inland towns, are rural, and form the most picturesque subjects in their loca lities. There is a general indication, even here, from which an observant visitant of the county may derive a useful lesson. In places which are subject to the fluctuations of commerce, and where the wide distinctions of wealth and poverty are strongly expressive of the vicissitudes inseparable from the game of trade, how skilfully soever it may be played, the dwellings of the wealthy are often sadly out of keeping with the localities in which they are placed, and the palace and the hovel come to a most incongruous and unseemly juxta-position with each other. But, in Hampshire, one rarely, if ever, meets with a palace in the desert, or a wretch- ed hovel standing side-by-side with a mansion of high pre- tence. On the contrary, for what purpose soever the structure is intended \u2014 whether as a mansion for the man of influence, a place of repose for the man of labour, or a receptacle for the produce or stock of the farm, it invariably seems part c2"], [36, "20 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. and parcel of the ground upon which it stands, and by which it is surrounded, so that each would be imperfect without the other. The fine climate of the county does not consume timber and corrode bricks so fast as the miasmatic atmos phere of some other places ; and on this account, the rural buildings, and also many of those in the towns, are of an cient date ; but this only adds to their picturesque appear ance, and makes them harmonize better with the county, which, as a district, rich in all the best bounties of the earth, and yielding its ready obedience to the labours of the husbandman, is still more ancient than they. Thus, though the impress of time is upon much of what is artificial in Hampshire, the same impress is still more strong upon what is natural ; and in both, one can perceive more of hope \u2014 more to delight the mind in forecast, than in places which a few years ago were green fields, which are at present streets and squares of flaunting houses, and which, ere ano ther century or half-century shall have gone by, may become heaps of ruins, according to the set of that commercial tide which no human foresight can anticipate or direct. This character of the buildings in Hampshire extends to the labours of man, and even to the more characteristic pro ductions of the earth, whether growing or living. There is no part of the county so barren as not to afford occasional pasture for a few sheep, and nesting-cover and food for a few of those birds which love the open downs and enliven the solitude there. But there is a pretty close approxima tion ; for many of the summits, especially where the soil is sand or gravel, are thinly scattered with stunted hea ther, tufts of little wiry grasses, and wild-flowers few and far between. Of such places, however, the greater number are not without their beauties, \u2014 the heaths are gay with purple in the season ; the wild thyme and other aro matic herbs, upon the richer downs, are most fragrant in their perfume; and the one and the other are, in their appro priate seasons, rendered joyously vocal by countless multi tudes of bees and other winged sporters in the delightful"], [37, "21 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. air. These little creatures are not altogether sent into the world to labour \u2014 to gather honey and to die ; there is a moral instruction in every thing that God has made, and if mankind were wise, a few days upon the downs, with the wild bees, would sinew the frame, and spare them many a wearied limb and aching head. The strongest contrast to the upland and arid, places of Hampshire is to be found in the water-meadows ; for which the valleys of the rivers, though not numerous, or of great breadth, are well adapted. These do not of course admit of culture for grain-crops \u2014 as the climate of England is not warm enough for rice, or any other grain-plant, the growth of which requires irrigation. Accordingly, natural grasses are the crops upon these water-meadows ; and, generally speaking, they are abundant in quantity and excellent in quality. Not only this ; for they contribute greatly to the beauty of the country in the winter, and to its freshness and fertility in the summer. During the first, the weather is severe indeed if those meadows at any time lose their greenness ; during the second, the advantages are still greater: there is a wonderful refreshment in the streams which are thus led over the meadows in a countless num ber of mains and branches ; the water is filtered from every impurity by the sward ; the atmosphere is cooled ; vegeta tion is refreshed ; and that reciprocal action between surface and surface, to which we formerly alluded, is greatly in creased. From the water-meadow to the most elevated and bleak part of the down, there is the same gradation in the woods and the crops, which, as we have remarked, occurred in the habitations of the people. The water-meadow yields, in the course of the year, two or three crops and a grazing. The lands immediately adjacent may, by a judicious rotation of crops, be cultivated every year. At a little greater distance from the waters, and at a higher elevation, the crops must be less frequent ; and their frequency diminishes until one ar rives at those summits which, under the present state of"], [38, "22 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. things, it is not found profitable to cultivate. Even here, however, the fineness of the climate affords some of the more essential elements of fertility, and these, too, elements which are wanting, where the soil is richer but the situation less favourable. Indeed, there is scarcely a spot within the county, but which, if sufficient manure could be obtained, might be made to produce abundant crops ; so that, though the improvements of Hampshire must be chiefly directed to agriculture and subjects connected with agriculture, and though the county is at present in a highly cultivated state, as compared with some other counties ; yet it is not easy to assign a limit to improvement in this respect, beyond which it shall not some day be carried ; and it is one consolation, and that a strong one, for the proprietor and the cultivator of the soil, and the enjoy er of those beauties and bounties of nature \u2014 which in their full freshness and perfection are enjoyed in the country only ; to know and to feel assured, that the bounty of the great Disposer of all things is every jot as inexhaustible in agriculture and all kinds of rural oc cupation, as it is in any of those arts which are carried on in the dingy atmosphere, and with the dull and unwholesome routine of the manufactory. The woods of Hampshire, whether in the royal forests, in the parks of the more wealthy proprietors, or in any other situations, are exceedingly beautiful, and they participate in that gradation which we have noticed as being so character istic and so harmonious, in the dwellings, the herbage, and the artificial crops. Nothing can exceed the richness of some of the groups and combinations of trees in the valleys and dells, and the old ones are often picturesque as single objects ; but still, the prevailing character, even of the finest scenery, is beauty, and often beauty of a very high order. Indeed, there are within this county, and often within no great distance from each other, very strong contrasts in respect of beauty. To give an instance, the mansion of Lord Ashburton, at Grange, with its grounds and water, is an example of classical beauty,"], [39, "23 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. which in purity of taste, harmony of parts, and pleasing \u2014 we may almost say enchanting, effect as a whole, is not ex ceeded by any place in England, if indeed it is equalled. For the general effect we must refer to the delineation given in the plate ; but faithful as that is to its subject, there is a feeling inspired by an actual visit to the Grange, especially on a fine summer evening, which neither pen nor pencil can communicate. In various parts of the county there are man sions and parks, far exceeding in dimensions those of the Grange ; and indeed it would require many volumes to do justice to the splendid dwellings and ornamental grounds with which Hampshire is so abundantly and so appropriately studded. There are no prominent features in the county which ad mit of being generalized. It contains no mountains or plains of any extent. Rivers are comparatively few ; and they are placid in their courses, descending by a gentle and nearly uniform slope, so that there is no such thing as a waterfall within the whole limits of the shire. It partakes of the character of a summitrlevel county, and receives not even a brook from any other, except from the adjoining county of Wilts, and from that only a few tripling brooks, and the Avon, which passes a very short way through Hants, above Christchurch. The central lengths intersect the county in an irregular curve, having its convexity towards the south-east, and its general direction south-east and north-west ; but even this is not continuous, so that it can be made the basis of a sys tematic description of the aspect of the whole : hence in this, as in all other matters, we are thrown upon the details, \u2014 details, which are in general interesting in themselves, but which cannot be reduced to any thing like system. PROGRESSIVE HISTORY OF HAMPSHIRE. After having stated, and, as we hope, demonstrated, that the term \"County History\" is a misnomer, it may be thought that we are guilty of a similar misnomer in the title of this"], [40, "24 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. section. Such, however, is not absolutely the case ; for, though the county can have no distinct history of its own, any more than other counties, yet it was in early times the scene of many of the most important events in the general history of the country ; and these events, in their progress, have had very considerable influences upon it, some of the results of which remain to the present time, and are trace able in its monuments and institutions, and perhaps also, to a considerable extent, in the manners and the occupations of its inhabitants. Thus as the direct influence of Hampshire upon England generally is traceable to a more early period than that of almost any other county \u2014 at least in so far as the particulars are known, the historical events which have occurred in it, and by which it has also been influenced, are of corresponding importance. In this, as in all matters of time, it is very difficult to get at a satisfactory beginning ; for, as the early chroniclers upon whom we must chiefly depend, lived not only when people generally were ignorant and credulous, but when it was a matter of policy on the part of the better informed to preserve ignorance and to promote credulity, it is by no means easy to winnow the wheat of what they narrate from the chaff, so as to reject the blinding or the unprofitable, and retain only that which is wholesome and useful. Such being the case, that which the utmost caution can select from matters so suspicious, cannot be implicitly relied on. The tradition runs that Belgic tribes, from the opposite shores of the Channel, landed and established themselves on the coasts of Hampshire. It is highly probable that this progress of mankind westward, caused the settlement of tribes from the Continent upon many of the proximate shores of Britain, long before the traditional invasion of the Belg\u00e6 \u2014 which is reported to have taken place sometime in the third century before Christ ; and, as migratory nations always improve by migration, we may conclude that those continental colonies derived advantages from their settlement in Britain, and also conferred advantages upon such of the"], [41, "25 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. previous residents as remained there and mingled with them. Though we have no positive record upon the subject, yet we have physical reasons to conclude, that the people of the north-east of Europe were attracted to the west, and ulti mately to Britain, by the superiority of the climate. Cesar mentions, that, in his time, it was much better in Britain than in Gaul \u2014 the adjoining part of the continent ; and there are various reasons which lead us to conclude, that this in feriority of climate increased eastwards, to a much greater extent than it does now ; for the Roman historians mention that soldiers had to divide their wine with a hatchet, in dis tricts where the vine now grows freely and produces abun dantly ; and for the Tiber to be completely frozen over, was no very unusual occurrence during severe winters. The thick woods, the continuous marshes, the blending of land and water, and the extreme cold of the spring in consequence of the ice which remained to be thawed, were the natural causes of this. In Britain these causes did not so much exist. The current of air from the Atlantic, must have set directly upon it then as it does now, and kept the sea open upon its shores during the winter, as well as have tended to lessen the quantity of snow and the time of its remaining on the surface, even when that surface was most thickly clothed with forests. At the same time, the cold of the forests of northern Europe must have condensed the atmosphere upon them, rendered the east wind more constant and violent, and retarded the current from the Atlantic to a much greater extent than is the case now. In later times, the forests of northern Germany have given place to naked and nearly desert surfaces, which are heated when the action of the sun becomes strong, and thus the Atlantic gales make their way much farther to the eastward than they did formerly. This has been advantageous to Britain in respect to climate, but it is more so to middle Europe, though the contrast of the seasons there is still more violent than in England. Hampshire, from its situation, must have been in a great measure exempted from the influence of the cold north-east. vol. i. *c"], [42, "26 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. Its undulated surface, and its gravelly and chalky soil, must have prevented any very considerable stagnation of water, even when the greater part of it was clothed with forests. These forests, too, must have consisted wholly, or chiefly, of deciduous trees ; for the probability is, that the yew is im- ported, and the Pine family, \u2014 those properly so called, are rarely found native upon such soils, unless upon sandy spots, where they and the native heaths may thrive together. But, where deciduous trees predominate in the forests, they do not prolong or increase the winter cold so much as ever- greens. The casting of the leaves in autumn admits the winter wind, and the rain and sunshine in the spring ; and thus the snow does not continue so long as where evergreens shadow the surface. The expansion of leaves too is attend- ed with a certain degree of heat, higher in proportion as the expansion is more rapid \u2014 as all heat is more conspicuous in proportion as the action of which it is one of the displays is more vigorous. This last is one of the causes of the speedy setting in of the spring warmth in northern climates ; and there is every reason to believe that it must have obtained in such districts of England as Hampshire, at the time when these abounded so much in deciduous forests. In conse- quence of this, though the winter may have been colder while it lasted, and the quantity of snow greater, the spring may have been almost as early, and the summer warmer than at the present time. There are some historical notices of the success of vineyards in the south of England formerly, which corroborate this hypothesis, \u2014 indeed it is no hypothe- sis, but a general fact, borne out by the testimony of those who have been the closest observers of nature. This was, no doubt, the attraction which drew the continental tribes to the British shores ; ancl as it must have been conspicuous in Hampshire, on account both of its soil and situation, the inducement to resort to this part of the country must have been correspondingly great ; and it is probable that a long succession of arrivals had peopled this county with mixed races of the Belg\u00e6, long before the commencement of tra-"], [43, "27 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. dition. When rude tribes are invaded, we can draw no positive conclusion from the names which are imposed ; be cause the name of the leading conqueror is often assumed by the conquered people. This was the case with most of the Highland clans, especially those of the western coasts of the Highlands; where the chiefs are mostly descended from Scandinavian vikingr, while the great bulk of the clans are Celtic, and have assumed the name of the chief as their feudal and most honourable appellation ; and it is by no means unlikely that something similar may have taken place in other parts of the Island. These colonies appear to have introduced some of the arts of civilised life. They grew corn, bred domestic cattle, ma nufactured cloth, and did various other things above the capacity of mere savages ; but they appear to have been, upon the whole, very rude. Before they could grow corn and breed cattle, they must have cleared off the woods in some places ; but it does not appear that they were ac quainted with the art of masonry, even in the rudest form ; for their habitations differed from those of the more savage inhabitants of the interior only by being mud huts, with roofs of reeds or rushes, while those of the more aboriginal Britons appear to have been nothing but wattled nooks and shelters in the copses, in like manner as their fortified cities were the fastnesses of the more extended forests. The in formation given us of these shadowy towns, including that of Cesar and of the acute and discriminating Tacitus, can not be implicitly relied upon ; but still there is enough of concurrent testimony to warrant the conclusion, that Hamp shire has been, in some sense of the term, an agricultural county for more than ten thousand years \u2014 possibly for a much longer period than this. Being colonists themselves, and having their fields and their habitations, however rude or limited, continually ex posed to the destructive ravages of the inland people, it is natural to suppose, that they would receive any strangers with less hostility, and especially strangers so much more *c 2"], [44, "28 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. polished than themselves, as the Romans were. Hence, we have no accounts of severe battles with the Romans, on their taking possession of this part of England, \u2014 such possession as it was ; for the Roman sway here appears all along to have had as much the character of a protection, pur chased by tribute from the protected, as of any thing in the way of forcible and repugnant subjugation. This may be one of the principal reasons why the people of Hampshire, and Winchester as their chief city, profited more by the example \u2014 and most probably by the direct teaching of the Romans, than most other parts of Britain. These advantages they enjoyed for a long period of years ; and many revolutions took place before the metropolitan character, either of the county or of the city, was obliterated. There are traces still, though most of them have been mo dernised ; and, if properly understood and appreciated, they are calculated to give an impulse to the people, correspond ing to which there is nothing in a country which is compa ratively new, and without a history. But though, during the time of the Romans, Hampshire appears to have been safe from tbreign invasion, and free from warfare of any veiy serious kind, the fruits of its indus try and tranquillity appear to have been fertile causes of the misfortunes which successively overtook it, after the Romans had been forced to withdraw their troops. But the hordes of the North, which was then the father-land of conquerors, ancl which had caused the withdrawal of the Romans, soon gave a new turn to the state of things, by the landing of Hengist and Horsa in Kent, in the forty-ninth year of the fifth century. Hampshire had been a Christian country, and, with the exception of the intervals of persecution, Christian princes had swayed their protected sceptres in Winchester for more than three hundred years ; and they continued to do so in peace for about forty years after the Saxons, who had been invited to aid, remained without any invitation, to command. The Saxons were bent on conquest however, and though"], [45, "GENERAL INTRODUCTION. 29 there was no invasion of the court, hostilities approached the northern limits of the county. A party of invading Saxons, under Ella, landed on the confines of Sussex ; and, after much fighting and spoliation, farther to the eastward, levelled the city\" of Silchester so completely that it has never been re-built, though it has been in ruins more than thirteen hundred years. Ambrosius, who then reigned in Winchester, is said to have defeated the Saxon at Wells ; but this period is the hiatus between the evening of the Roman history and the dawn of the chroniclers ; and thus, very little reliance can be placed upon the details of its history. Ella esta blished himself as ruler of the South Saxons, and he is said to have had some controul over the other chiefs of these people. Winchester was, however, still the residence of a Romanised British prince. It was soon, however, to undergo a different fate : for Cerdic landed upon the coast of the south-western country, into which the Saxons had not yet penetrated, any farther than the destruction of Silchester by Ella, eighteen years before the landing of Cerdic. He landed in 485; but at what point is not said, further than that it was at \" Cerdic shore,\" which, as it means nothing more than it expresses, namely, Cerdic's shore \u2014 the beach where he landed, is a bonne bouche for the etymologists, who, before they fix on a place, however, would do well to reflect that if there had been any town of importance where Cerdic landed, the name would have been noticed in the account. The armament of Cerdic, and its means of transit \u2014 15,000 warriors in five ships, are in all probability greatly exaggerated. Still, his army was, no doubt, a formidable one. But formidable as it was, he did not obtain possession of the country upon so easy terms as some of the Saxons far ther to the east had done ; for it was not till after the lapse of at least twenty years, and after he had received reinforce ments from the continent, that he obtained possession of Winchester, and so became master of the country. As we have said, the night of uncertainty broods darkly"], [46, "30 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. upon this period of our history ; and accordingly, it is here that the romance of King Arthur is thrust in, with perhaps some truth, but certainly a great deal more of invention and fable. It is probable that Cerdic found the landing-places on the immediate coast of Hampshire too\" well guarded ; and therefore it is probable that he effected his landing on the coast of Dorset, and gradually took possession of the districts to the west. Portsmouth and the adjoining district are said to have been taken possession of by a separate body of Saxon marauders, about six years after the landing of Cerdic, and these maintained themselves there until he gained possession of the capital, upon which they became his vassals. But notwithstanding that these became auxi liaries, Cerdic did not find himself in a condition for giving battle to the main army of Hampshire until he was rein forced by the Saxons of Kent and Sussex, who, having se cured their own conquests, could spare him the assistance he needed. With this assistance Cerdic defeated the army of the Britons, somewhere in the New Forest or upon its northern confines ; but the battle was severe ; and though it was fought about twelve years after his landing in 495, it was not till after he had, in 514, received a fresh levy of Saxons from abroad, that he was able to approach Winches ter, the conquest of which was the only step which could insure his possession of the country. At length, in 515, or 516, he had so far mastered the country around as to be able to assail the city, which made a very determined resistance, and upon being taken met with a fate equally horrible, \u2014 so that, the sacking of Winchester by the Saxons, under Cerdic, was a miniature of that of Rome by the Barbarians. Winchester was, indeed, a sort of little Rome at this period, and it probably had a good deal of the refinement of Rome, without any of the counteracting circumstances which led to the downfall of a city, the wealth of which was forcibly drawn from many parts of the world. We are not to suppose that Hampshire could be, for more than six hundred years, upon friendly terms with the Romans, and"], [47, "31 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. not have profited much by the Roman example, in those arts which appear to have had some beginning in the district before the Romans came. The determination with which the Hampshire men defended their country and their city, appears to have been in propor tion to the value of that for which they were maintaining a gallant, but, in the end, an unsuccessful struggle ; and there is no doubt, that the cupidity of the invader was whetted by the same means. It is probable that, during this siege of the city, and after its capture, the greater part of the Roman monuments of art were destroyed; for they are fewer in number and less important in kind, than are to be found at other places where the Romans were neither so long nor so quietly in possession ; and whatever the Romans produced here, had been saved from the devastation which Boadicea, and some others of the turbulent natives had effected in other places. How it fared with the country generally, during the pro gress of the Saxon conquest, there are no data by which we can come to any satisfactory conclusion. The Saxons were heathens, no doubt ; and they were a ferocious race. Yet they were not quite savages ; but must have been men of some cultivation, as well as of much enterprise. Mere barbarians do not build ships capable of carrying 3000 men in each, or undertake voyages of 500 or 600 miles, neither do they carry on a regular war for at least twenty years. During these twenty years, too, there must have been some tendency to approximation of manners between the Roman Britons and the Saxons ; and this may have paved the way for the more ready re-establishment of the Christian religion among the Saxons of Hampshire. Altogether, this is a very important part of history, though neither the limits to which we are confined, nor the unsatis factory nature of the records, will allow us to enter upon it. The more ready reception of the Romans, a more civilised people, and the more vigorous resistance made to the Saxons, than in most other parts of the country, shew that the peo-"], [48, "32 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. pie of Hampshire must have been different from most of the rest of those in England, even in these early times ; and though the Chroniclers record chiefly the deeds of kings and churchmen, there must have been something in the people and in the country as improved by them ; and this has, most likely, had more effect than matters which occupy a far greater breadth of the record. Cerdic, who was unquestionably, in the usual language of history, a great man, became a leader among the Saxon princes, as soon as by the capture of the city he had made himself master of Hampshire. Fourteen years after this event, he conquered the Isle of Wight; and having spent about twenty years in forming a kingdom, and ten more in extending it, he died in the year 534. The successors of Cerdic inherited his ambition and his valour, to a very considerable extent ; and hence they were, for more than fifty years after his death, engaged in constant wars for accessions of territory. The Britons, under a dif ferent prince, however, and apparently as a less Romanised nation than they who had finally yielded to Cerdic, on the taking of the capital of Hampshire, \u2014 though they have sometimes been confounded with each other, \u2014 still held pos session of the upper valley of the Thames, and the country thence, over at least a great part of South Wales. The first great encounter took place in consequence of the Britons having come in force into the territory of Caenric, the son of Cerdic. He advanced to repel them ; and routed them with great slaughter, near Salisbury, about eighteen years after the death of his father. Then came his turn to invade ; and four years after (556,) a desperate battle was fought at Banbury ; and this, in which he was victorious, though vic tory was dearly bought, was his last great battle which he fought with the Britons. The extent of the kingdom of the West Saxons, which had now pushed its confines to the north and east, ancl was secure on the west and south, aroused the jealousy of the other Saxon kingdoms, with whom the first great battle"], [49, "33 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. was fought at Wimbledon, between Ceaulin the grandson of Cerdic, and Ethelbert of Kent. The victory here, afforded a second step toward the ascendency which appears to have been an early object with the Hampshire princes ; and another was obtained by his defeating the Britons in Buck inghamshire and also on the Severn, and gaining possession of some of the strongholds on the latter, by means of which the Britons appear to have been, in a great measure, re stricted to the country west of and upon the Severn, and their attacks upon the Saxons reduced to marauding inroads, more for plunder than for conquest. But the fortune of war was not constant to one side, in the latter part of the sixth century, any more than in the early part of the nineteenth ; for though he had acquired additional territory and strength by the forcible annexation of the South Saxon kingdom to his own, Ceaulin was de feated, and great part of his army killed, in a battle with the Britons, on the northern confines of his kingdom. During the years which closed the sixth century and began the seventh, the West Saxon princes were engaged in almost continual wars with most of the other Saxon princes in succession, and also with the Britons, who were always ready to strike in when an opportunity offered. The West Saxons did not embrace the Christian faith so early as those of the other branches of the Heptarchy except Mercia, nor was it till about 120 years after the conquest by Cerdic, that Kinegels was converted. This happened about the year 636 ; and after this time the kingdom proceeded with various successes for more than a century and a half, until the Heptarchy became one kingdom under Egbert, in 827 ; and after this the History of Hampshire merges in that of England ; for, though Winchester continued to be the capital till after the Norman Conquest, this is the proper ter mination of the history of the county. This history, as an independent state of some sort or other, though varying much in its limits at different times, may be regarded as pretty clearly ascertained for a period of a thousand years \u2014 or VOL. I. D"], [50, "34 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. for three centuries before the birth of Christ, and seven after. What influence the conversion of their king to Christianity had upon the character of the Saxons as a people, it would not be easy to say at this distance of time. It certainly did not make them less pugnacious than they had been before, nor were they, upon the whole, more successful in their wars. Some time of course elapsed before such a people began to feel the mild influence of the doctrines of the Cross ; and we accordingly find that at least some of the pious deeds of the early kings, which are so much lauded by the monkish historians, had to the full as much of idolatry in them as of Christianity, or religion of any kind. The recorded acts of devotion are mostly grants made to religious houses, which were certainly bestowed with no stinted hand ; but they often bore a good deal of the appearance of expiations in age for what had been perpetrated in youth ; and this was not wholly confined to monarchs, neither did it cease when the Norman conquest dethroned the Saxons, and they became Normanised on their return to power. But these are mat ters which do not necessarily come within our province. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT. Few points connected with the describing of a county are more perplexing to deal with, than the many and varied subjects upon which the describer has to touch, considering the narrow limits within which he is confined. In the case of every county, these difficulties are more or less felt, but they are peculiarly great in the case of Hampshire. In this county, the charms of the present, and the visions of the past, so crowd upon and overcome us almost at every step we can take, that a proper monograph upon many a single mile, would require as much breadth of writing as we can afford to half the county ; and many, indeed most of them, are so interesting, both topographically and historically, that it is difficult to bring one's-self to the resolution of quitting them in a manner so summary as that which is absolutely necessary."], [51, "35 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. Therefore, the only resource which is left, by means whereof something like justice can be done to the details, and yet the whole have an appearance of connection, is to make use of the great natural features of the county, in the twofold sense, of dividing it into portions and at the same time connecting those portions with each other ; and even here, those natural features go only a very little way in assist ing us, inasmuch as after two or three of the leading ones are disposed of, those which remain are so numerous, so slightly marked, and bear in general so much resemblance to each other, that no very obvious distinctions can be founded upon them. This, however, is attended with some countervailing advantages, inasmuch as the similarity of sur face and physical character which is equally applicable to large districts of the county, shortens the detail that other wise would be necessary. The artificial divisions, whether parliamentary or otherwise, are of very little use in the way even of simple topographical description; and accordingly they can be much more briefly, as well as far more usefully, given in a statistical table appended to the work, in which they will be found. In looking at the map, \u2014 and the map must be the general foundation of a county-description, as well as an index and artificial memory of the details, \u2014 in looking at the map, it will be at once perceived that there are three divisions ofthe county of Hants, very obviously distinguishable from each other by natural separations ; and these will, of course, be of some service in allocating certain portions of the descrip tion. First, and most completely separated, and thus distin guishable from the rest of the county, there is the Isle of Wight, which, notwithstanding some misapprehension by or of the ancient writers as to its being once accessible by land at low water, has obviously been always insular in every state of the tide, and insulated by deeper channels, that is, channels more free of banks, in the early ages, than it is now. In stating this, we do not of course refer to the"], [52, "36 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. positively aboriginal state of the Isle of Wight and the channels between it and the mainland \u2014 for of that state we know nothing, \u2014 we speak only of times posterior to any great geologic change, which may have occasioned a violent shifting of place in sea and land. Secondly, there is the portion of Hampshire, lying to the south-west of the Southampton Water, and abutting on Dorsetshire on the west, and on Wilts for the western half of its northern boundary. In respect of the rest of Hamp shire, this portion is almost completely insulated, the only place of it which joins other land of the county being from Redbridge at the head of the Southampton Water west ward across the hundred of Redbridge to Cadnam, on the borders of Wilts, and this is not above five miles and three quarters on the straight line. About half of this portion is occupied by the New Forest, including various manors and patches of land, which have been disafforested ; and for this reason, the New Forest is the most convenient general name for this peninsular division. Thirdly, there is the mainland of Hampshire strictly so called, and which is more than double both Island and Pe ninsula, in extent of surface. This is the portion with which it is most difficult to deal, inasmuch as it has two slopes, the one toward the Channel, and the other toward Berkshire on the north, and Surrey on the north-east ; and because the summit-level which separates those slopes is very difficult to trace, on account of its own irregularity, and also of the difficulty of fixing it in many places, on account of the ab sence of running waters. The irregularity arises from the highest grounds in the county consisting of portions of the two great chalk ridges, which cross this part of England from east to west. The most southerly of these is a con tinuation of the Sussex Downs, which enters the county to the south of Petersfield, near the sources of the western branches of the Arun, and this ridge becomes irregular, bending northward, in the summAlevel between the several sources of the Arun and the Wey, until near Basingstoke,"], [53, "37 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. a few miles to the north of which, the northern or Surrey ridge of chalky down, which is interrupted for about sixteen miles from Farnham, again makes its appearance, and con tinues westward in a very irregular line across the county, into Wilts. At Farnham, the Wey and the Blackwater ap proach within little more than a mile of each other, and the intermediate country is a continuation of the same valley ; but the former river runs eastward, to where it finds a pas sage through the ridge at Farnham, while the latter curves round in a north-westerly direction, and forms the boundary between Hants and Surrey, and then between Hants and Berks, and ultimately joins the Lodden, about a mile and a half to the north of Hampshire, in a small portion of Wilts, which is situated here. The remainder of north Hants con sists of a country sloping toward the valley of the Kennet, or rather of its affluent the Emborne. Thus, there is one portion of the mainland of Hampshire, which lies in a sort of horse-shoe form, embracing the re mainder in its concavity. This portion is exceedingly irre gular, though the rivers are every where directed from the centre of the county, and thus the general slope every where is outwards. In the south they flow directly to the Channel or its creeks ; in the south-east they flow toward the Arun, which reaches the Channel through Sussex ; on the middle of the east side, they flow toward the Wey ; and from the north-east ancl north, they are discharged into various branch es of the Thames. The mainland portion which remains, consists of the val leys of the Itchen and Test; and as this portion contains Winchester and Southampton, and is naturally a separate district, discharging the whole of its running water into its own estuary at Southampton, it is made the subject of the first volume. In absolute surface, it is much smaller than that which will require to be described in the second volume ; but Winchester, from the importance of its history, and the number of its ancient remains requires a breadth of descrip-"], [54, "38 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. tion which will not be called for in any other instance within the county. It is purposed to comprise the rest of the mainland of Hants in the second volume, arranging the districts in such order as may, to the greatest possible extent, ensure the re quisites of brevity and clearness. The Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands, are intended to form the subjects of the third volume."], [55, ""], [56, "Wfl.flSCMESTE.IR.

HISTORICAL NOTICE OF THE CITY OF WINCHESTER. Winchester, the metropolis of Hampshire, and the only city in the shire, is remarkably well situated, both in respect of being central to the whole county, and of proximity to the sea by the port of Southampton. The situation has many natural advantages, \u2014 a most salubrious atmosphere, an abundant supply of the purest water, a sheltered loca lity, with as much of slope as affords every facility to clean liness, a pleasant and plentiful country around, and excellent roads diverging from it in very many directions. The prin cipal part is in the hundred of Buddlesgate; but all the suburbs on the left or east bank of the Itchen are in the hundred of Fawley. The particulars will, however, be no ticed in a future chapter. The names \" Winchester\" and \" Winton,\" are indiscri minately given to this city, though the former is that com monly used. In as far as \" Win,\" anciently Vin, forms part of both names, it may be considered as a contraction of the old name Venta, of which name some notice will be taken afterwards. When the termination is \" Chester,\" anciently ceaster \u2014 probably the Anglo-Saxon from the Latin castrum a castle or stronghold, it has allusion to the former fortifica tions of the place ; and when \" ton,\" anciently tun, or dun, is used, it alludes more expressly to the town."], [58, "40 CITY OF WINCHESTER. The history of Winchester has been so thoroughly inves tigated by the Reverend Dr. Milner, and is so fully detailed in his great historical work, expressly on the subject, that to enter much into the particulars of it here would be as un necessary as inconsistent with the nature of the present pub lication, of which the object is, as far as possible, to do justice to all parts of the county. As long as Winchester continued to be the capital of a separate state, and indeed down to the time at which it ceased to be the metropolis of the country, its history merges in a more general history : first, of Hampshire and the sur rounding district, down to the union of the Heptarchy under Egbert ; and secondly, of England, from that union to the present time. Of the first of these, a very brief outline will be found in a preceding section of the introductory chapter; and the second lies wholly without our province. For these reasons, one or two points of a historical nature are all that we require to state. As is the case with most ancient towns and cities, not actually founded by people whose history is recorded, it is impossible for us to say at what time Winchester became a town in the modern acceptation of the word, and as opposed to castrum and dun, both of which appear to have been used more in reference to protection afforded by fortifications and the continued presence of armed troops, than to the faci lities of carrying on the arts of peace. The probability is that, during the greater part of the stay of the Romans in Britain, more attention was paid in Win chester to the accommodations of peace than to defences from attack \u2014 though most ancient towns and cities had forti fications of some kind or other ; as, during that period, the actual battles which were fought, were in general far from the gates of Winchester. From this we may suppose \u2014 and it is only supposition, that, during this period, the city, con sidered as such, was in a state of gradual improvement. When the withdrawal of the Romans, and the breach of promise on the part of the Saxons, had brought the more"], [59, "41 CITY OF WINCHESTER. easterly parts of England under the dominion of the latter as conquering invaders; and when they began to menace these western parts ; it is probable that the fortifications of Winchester were strengthened. The comparatively slow progress of Cerdic \u2014 taking, as has been said, about twenty years from his first landing to the taking of Winchester^ must have given a complete warning to make Winchester as impregnable as possible. The chroniclers indeed, if we did not carefully collate their particular statements with the general scope of the whole, would lead us to conclude that Winchester had been plundered by the Saxons, as early as 457. For, when Vorti- gern, who had been taken prisoner, after the murder ofthe 300 Britons, in the drunken brawl at Amesbury, purchased his liberty from Hengist, he is said to have \" given up\" the cities of London, Westminster, Lincoln, and Winchester, along with \" the three provinces.\" But the expression tribus pro- vinciis \u2014 of the \" three provinces,\" used by William of Malms- bury, points out the real nature of what was given by Vorti- gern. The \" three provinces\" is an expression for the whole of Britain, considered as a Roman territory ; and Vortigern could give up only the sovereignty which he held as repre- senting the Romans. But they had withdrawn, and Vorti- gern was a captive, so that whatever he might promise he had not much to give. Actual possession of Winchester by the Saxons under Hengist in 457, is not consistent with the avoidal of that city by Ella, during his march to Bath in 492 or 493. Ella himself did not attempt this expedition until he had been sixteen years in the country, and had formed a league with Esca the son of Hengist ; and this happened two years before the landing of Cerdic. Thus, any serious plundering of Winchester by the Saxons, previous to that in 515 or 516, by Cerdic, is not consistent with the general tenor of the history ; and we are accord ingly led to consider that as the first great check upon its prosperity after the Romans visited the country. As a city, it either did not suffer much then, or it speedily recovered; VOL. I. E"], [60, "42 CITV OF WINCHESTER. for Cerdic was formally crowned in it, only three or four years after he had taken possession, which seems to imply that he had got a sort of legal possession of a peopled country, and not merely established his followers in one which had been depopulated by war ; and Cerdic's original Saxons appear to have been exhausted during the long-pro tracted war, as the Jutes, who were the last that came, appear to have formed the principal part of his army, and they retained their original name, until, under Egbert, the Saxons and Jutes were lost in the general appellation of Engle, or English. From this date till the time it was plundered by the Danes, the prosperity of Winchester seems to have been progressive ; and, about thirty-eight years after the union of the heptarchy, its commerce was so considerable, that the merchants were formed into a guild, under the royal protec tion. But the troubles occasioned by the Danes caused many reverses, which did not cease till Canute was esta blished on the throne ; from which epoch a fresh period of prosperity may be dated. One of the most celebrated of the Saxon kings, not for getting the better of difficulties, but for keeping out of them, was Edgar ; and during his reign, Winchester made rapid advances. In his reign, the staple trade of wool was much improved, Winchester measure became the standard of the kingdom, and various other regulations were made, all of which added to the greatness of the city. Subsequently, it suffered much from the Danes ; but again recovered under Canute and his successors ; though after this the royal favour does not appear to have been so much concentrated upon Winchester as it had formerly been. Edward the Confessor bestowed various favours upon it ; but the foundation of the abbey of Westminster, the political ascendency of Canter bury, and some other circumstances, laid the foundation of its future decline, which various events, from time to time, helped to accelerate. The arrival of the notorious Emma from Normandy, and"], [61, "43 CITY OF WINCHESTER. her marriage with Ethelred at Winchester, in 1002, paved the way for the introduction of many Normans ; and, giving a Norman turn to the manners of the people, led the way to the conquest by William ; so that, though it caused an in crease of Winchester, and a strengthening of its fortifications then, it involved some of the principles which in the end oc casioned the decline of the city. In the second year of Henry I, (1102,) Winchester suf fered greatly by fire, and the records of its early history were by that means destroyed ; but the city was soon re built, and became more wealthy and splendid than ever; and an extensive commerce, as well as some manufactures for general supply, were carried on in it. It then averaged a mile in extent beyond its present limits, and contained, of course, a greater population, though how much greater there are no data for ascertaining. It became the theatre of civil war on the death of Henry ; and suffered so much, that it never after recovered. These desolating horrors raged with great violence, until within a year of the death of Stephen, in 1154; and though Henry II encouraged the re-building of the city, the expense of the Crusades began to drain the resources of Europe ; and about the same time, Winchester was again destroyed by fire. One cause of the suffering of Winchester during the reign of Stephen, was the warm part which Stephen's brother, Henry de Blois, then bishop of Winchester, took in the cause of Stephen ; and thus, though this bishop founded hospitals, and made various endowments, he was the means of bringing distress upon the city. During the reigns which followed that of Stephen, and the domestic troubles which then distracted the country, as well as the withdrawal of attention from matters at home by the importance attached to the crusade, the morals of the people declined greatly ; and the neighbourhood of Win chester was infested by banditti, among whom were in cluded some of the most influential inhabitants of the city and neighbourhood, ancl also some pf the courtiers attendant e2"], [62, "44 CITY OF WINCHESTER. upon the king. Henry III exerted himself with partial success, for the repression of these enormities ; but Win chester suffered greatly in his contentions with the barons ; and the evil was increased, by feuds and broils among the inhabitants themselves. Still, owing in part no doubt to Winchester's being Henry's native city, it met with as much attention from him as his own circumstances would admit ; and, accordingly, it soon recovered from its disasters. Circumstances became unpropitious, however, during the reign of Edward I ; and the disaster was perfected, and the magistrates imprisoned, in consequence of suspected colli sion in the escape of a hostage from the castle. This was re mitted at the instigation of the queen ; but the city again suf fered greatly in the disturbances during the reign of Edward II. Edward III made some efforts to encourage the wool trade ; but the trade suffered severely, \u2014 first by the French destroying its port of Southampton, and again by the com parative depopulation of that place, and of Winchester itself, by the pestilence in 1348. Subsequently, this monarch may be said to have completed the commercial ruin both of Southampton and of Winchester, by the removal of the \u2022wool-staple or mart to Calais. The wars with France, and those of the Roses, confirmed the ruin ; and though various efforts were made for that purpose, Winchester never re gained its former splendour, \u2014 though its religious establish ments continued, in some sort, a minor substitute for the court. This was much reduced by the suppression of these houses in the reign of Henry VIII ; for, though many in dividuals profited by that measure, much of the support of Winchester was withdrawn. In consequence of this suc cession of disastrous changes \u2014 not disastrous in the end for England, though very much so for Winchester at the time, by the middle of the reign of Elizabeth, the city had become poor and ruinous. In 1587, Elizabeth granted a charter of conformation and extension of privileges ; but this appears to have had no effect in restoring the city, or even in retard ing its further decline. \u201e"], [63, "45 CITY OF WINCHESTER. The Stuarts shewed some partialities to the city of Win chester ; but the civil war, and the subsequent abdication of James II, paralysed and put an end to them. Charles II began a palace in the vicinity of the old castle, which had been demolished by Cromwell ; but it is doubtful whether his occasional residence in or near Winchester was in any way beneficial to the city. With the revolution in 1688, all prospect of Winchester's ever again recovering any portion of that metropolitan wealth and splendour, which may be said to have gradually risen to its zenith \u2014 as compared with the rest of the country \u2014 during a period of about thirteen hundred years, of au thenticated or probable history, and fluctuated, during its decline, for about five hundred, may be said to have ended ; and, from this time, it began to revive in another way \u2014 as simply a provincial city. Then, however, it derived certain advantages from its cathedral and its college, which it could not enjoy from its mere situation, or its county and local business. These advantages it still continues to enjoy ; and, therefore, independently of the interest which it derives from what it has once been, it must always maintain a su perior degree of stability, which, while its institutions remain, cannot be taken from it by any of those fluctuations to which towns dependent upon manufactures are always liable. We have omitted to mention the last calamity which can be said to have fallen upon the city of Winchester \u2014 namely the great pestilence in 1666. This was not, as in London, accompanied by a fire, as destructive of the buildings of the city as the pestilence was of the inhabitants. But it left many of the dwellings tenantless at a time when there were few inducements to re-people them by an ingress of strangers. So severe- was the disease, that the country people who brought provisions to the city, would not come near the inhabitants, but left their commodities upon a great stone without the west gate, from which they were fetched by the people, and the prices left in their stead. The \" Na tives' Society\" was then formed for the relief of the sufferers ;"], [64, "46 CITY OF WINCHESTER. and this society erected an obelisk upon the stone, in com memoration of its own labours, and of the melancholy oc casion upon which they were first required. This Natives' Society was soon followed by the establishment of an Aliens' Society, the chief object of which was to apprentice deserving boys of poor parents to respectable trades, whether natives of Winchester or no, whereas the first-mentioned society was restricted to natives. Both societies still exist, are judici ously conducted, and do much good. There is another pro vision for young tradesmen, in Winchester, viz. a fund for such as have maintained a good character during their ap prenticeship, may get the use of twenty-five pounds for ten years, without interest to assist them in commencing business.

CITY OF WINCHESTER. \u2014 DETAILS. There are at least six principal approaches to the city of Winchester, all of which present it to the visitor in very dif- ferent aspects, and as none of them are very distant, the characters are at once made out. Decidedly the most favour- able approaches, in respect of landscape, are those from the opposite bank of the Itchen ; and of them the preferable one is on the hill road to Portsmouth, where the city ap- pears at a single point of the downs across the vale of Chil- comb and the Itchen, with its meadows. In this view, though there is nothing picturesque, there is much of land- scape beauty. The other view from the east is from the Al- resford road ; and from it also the city is distinctly seen, but it is too much of a bird's-eye view, and the buildings are huddled together. On tbe opposite side of the river the view from the Romsey side of the road is decidedly the best, though it partakes rather too much of the panoramic cha racter, and one's eye is tempted to wander both up and down the valley as the terminations in these directions are attrac tive. From the Andover road the view is inferior; and from both the Basingstoke and the Southampton roads, the aspect of the city is tame, and the Cathedral, of which the roof only is seen, and seen in the whole of its length, has a barn-like appearance. As all the great roads converging upon Winchester lead"], [68, "48 CITY OF WINCHESTER. to the High-street, that is the part of the city from which a visitor naturally begins his observations of what is to be seen in it. From the upper part of this street, the West Gate of the city is seen ; and this is the remain of its ancient condition, which is most likely first to attract the eye of a stranger. The principal part of this gate is Nor man, and was probably erected in the reign of the Con queror, or soon after ; but the external facing is of more recent date, though of what particular date is not known. This gate was, of course, built for defence, and not for ornament ; and thus it has no particular architectural beauty. The only other piece of ancient architecture which can be wholly seen from the High-street, is the City Cross, or market cross. It is said to have been erected about the middle ofthe fifteenth century ; but the date and purpose are alike inde finite, though most likely it simply pointed out the place of market, as was done by crosses in very many towns. It is an elegant structure, about forty-three feet high ; but the form of it can be better judged of from the annexed cut, than from any verbal description ; or indeed by actually seeing it, as it is huddled into a corner, and cannot be seen in effective relief from any proper distance. Turning to the right at the cross, one soon reaches the Square, in which there is no modern building of any note, excepting that which contains the butcher-market on the ground area, and the apartments of the Mechanics' Institution above. But this is a place of some vicissitudes. The butcher market was formerly there ; the portion above was once a school, and subsequently it was a theatre. In more early times the ground formed part of the precinct of the"], [69, "49 CITY OF WINCHESTER. old palace which was inhabited by William the Conqueror, previous to the founding ofthe castle; but demolished after the erection of that fortress, and the materials employed in building Wolvesey Castle, now in ruins. There is something whereupon to moralise in this spot, although it now contains no memorial of the days of old. It has been a place of many vicissitudes : once the abode of a haughty conqueror ; next supplying materials for the fortified palace of some of the most powerful bishops recorded in the annals of England; subsequently divided between the mansions of the living and the dead \u2014 about one-third of its area \u2014 originally a square of four hundred feet \u2014 being taken into the public burying-ground, and the rest covered by ordinary dwellings and a street. Nor have the vicissitudes stopped here : the butcher market and theatre, which occu pied the same building in this street, are giving place to a Mechanics' Institution, which, under the fostering care that the more influential classes are bestowing upon it, may be of great service to their humbler brethren, in an intellectual, and even a national point of view. Thus, we have a whole succession of changes in earthly matters, suggested to us as a fit preparation for the next subject, \u2014 the most important one which the county possesses, and which breathes an air of that immortality, whose glad sounds have so often been heard within its walls. This subject is WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL. There is scarcely a sacred edifice, or public structure of any kind, in the British Islands, better calculated to com mand the attention and gratify the contemplation, of the lover of architectural sublimity, the moralist in human na ture and history, and the man embued with the true spirit of our holy religion, than this mighty pile, which has been a temple of religion for the long period of about seventeen hundred years. From the public roads, seven in number, which converge upon 'Winchester, almost equally from all quarters of the VOL. I.

On those which lead from the east and the west, the view is finest ; because they lie across the elevated downs skirting the rich valley of water meadows which the Itchen em broiders with its chrystal streams. Approaching by these, ancl especially the London road through Alresford, the city opens upon the view at once, with the cathedral foreshorten ed, and all the other conspicuous buildings grouped, so as to set it off with the finest possible effect. From the north and south roads, which lie more in the valley, the appearance is tamer, in consequence of the cathedral being seen in its entire length ; but still, from them, its simple magnitude is by no means unimpressive. Those distant views are forgotten upon entering the city ; and as the cathedral is not seen from the parts which have been noticed, it comes at once upon the sight in issuing from the narrow passage at the north-west angle of the burial ground; and here the approach is unrivalled in solemn grandeur. Two rows of stately trees, with their branches overarched and interlacing, present the visitor with a fine example of that building of living nature, springing vigor ously from the earth, and rising proudly toward the heavens, which, whether it was or was not the origin of the most sublime style of our sacred architecture, is unquestionably one of the best emblems of it. The greater part of the building is curtained by the foliage of those trees, and by that of a number of others which extend eastward, shadow ing and ornamenting the place of sepulture, but not crowd ing so closely upon the building as to obstruct the near view of it, to exclude it from the free air of heaven, or to erode its walls by the cold dripping of their leaves. , The vista formed by this avenue is nearly five hundred feet in length ; and as the trees do not extend the whole way to the building, a clear light breaks in, throwing 'back,"], [71, "\"WEN CM IE 3 ffffi ffl SATTSIffiJIIlIRAIL . .v-/-: TV/ EAST VIEW sUK&Mis/ud for the Pra/trieler Ja?

Advancing some two-thirds along the avenue, and step ping a few paces to one's left, the cathedral is seen in its most favourable aspect, and finely projected against the sky. This is the point of view selected by our artist for the near prospect of the edifice ; and nothing could be more judi cious than the selection, or more faithful than the execution ; so that, whoever is in possession of this plate, can at once form as correct an idea of Winchester Cathedral, as the graver can suggest. For the details of this structure, as well as for those of every other subject which we notice in Winchester, we must refer to Dr. Milner's History and Description of the City, as the most complete that has been published ; ancl professed antiquaries and controversialists will naturally have recourse to the original documents. Such details are necessarily in compatible with the nature of the present work, which treats of the whole county, and ought therefore to address itself to readers of all descriptions, and not to antiquaries, historians, or any other particular class. But, while we make this reference, we cannot resist offer ing a few reflections, such as are likely to arise in the mind of every enlightened reader who beholds the cathedral from some such spot as that from which our view has been taken. There are feelings of more than mortal intensity connected with those solemn and stately temples in which religion has been maintained, amid the changes of churches and the rise and downfall of kingdoms. In this light, Winchester may be said to stand foremost. Fifty generations of men have been gathered to the dust since it was a place of Christian worship; and though, in the course of this long series of life and death, it has undergone many reverses, it has never"], [74, "52 CITY OF WINCHESTER. been long in abeyance ; and even now, there are ample por tions of the structure in existence, the builders of which have been in their graves for more than eight hundred years. Its history, as an edifice, in one or another of its parts, is thus a very long one ; and, in the aspect of the structure, there is an air of endurance nowhere else to be met with. When we examine it, we cannot definitely say that it is either old or new ; for it exhibits no symptom of decay, and as little of repair. Simple, massive, and without almost a single crumbling stone, it stands emblematical of that faith, which ought never to fail until it ushers in the full fruition of everlasting enjoyment; and we should pity the human being who could look upon such a structure, without having his mind purified and his hopes strengthened. This is no vain dream, neither is it any idle desire to round a period with sonorous words. There is a language above all words, breathed forth by a sacred edifice which has come down to us from the remotest antiquity, for which we may seek in vain in even the finest erection of modern date ; and, the ground which has been trodden by the feet of fifty generations of worshippers, and the walls and roof that have echoed half a million times to the praises of the Al mighty, independently of private devotions performed at the shrines and chantries during the Catholic times \u2014 as has been the case at this cathedral \u2014 inspire a solemnity of feeling which few can resist. During the lengthened period for which it has existed, and the successions of ruin and renovation to which it has been subjected, this cathedral has, of course, exhibited many styles of architecture. It is said to have been first erected in the second century of the Christian \u00e6ra, amid or upon the ruins of some heathen temples, dedicated to one or ano ther of the gods of Pagan Rome ; and probably it was in the Grecian style as altered by the Romans. The early writers say that this primitive church was much larger than the present cathedral ; but after one hundred and twenty years, this edifice was completely destroyed, and lay in ruins"], [75, "53 CITY OF WINCHESTER. for twenty years. Being re-built, it stood as a Christian church, till, in the early part of the sixth century, it was converted into a Saxon temple, by Cedric. About the middle of the seventh century, the Saxons embraced the Christian faith, and this church was again restored to the true religion. It is probable that \" the first edition,\" as it may be termed, of this memorial of many changes, was much more splendid than the second ; and that, not only the structure which the Saxons first converted into a temple for Woden and Thor, and then back again to a place of Christian worship, but also the first Saxon fabric, suggested by Birinus, were, in great part at least, formed of wood, the chief material which the early Saxons employed in all their buildings \u2014 and which, it appears, then grew in great abundance, upon those chalky downs which are now naked and swept by the winds. Here we may remark, in passing, that those woods upon the heights, must have contributed not a little to the then fertility of the country, and enabled Hampshire, and the sur rounding districts of similar character, to support a much more numerous population than they are capable of support ing at present, notwithstanding the modern improvements in agriculture. This is a point to which we shall afterwards have occasion to revert, as bearing directly upon the suscep tibility of the county in respect of increased beauty and fer tility ; but our present subject is the cathedral, to the con templation of which we shall therefore return. Though the Saxons were a rude people, the very fact of their being conquerors proved that they were energetic, and being energetic, they could not remain long after sheathing the sword without cultivating the arts of peace. It pleads strongly for the influence of the Christian Religion, in elevating the character and calling forth the more valuable energies of human beings, that conversion to that holy faith appears to have been the first step taken in civili sation by our Saxon ancestors, and that the re-building of the cathedral of Winchester, in a style more worthy of its sacred purpose than they found it on their arrival, was"], [76, "54 CITY OF WINCHESTER. projected within a year or two of the conversion of the Saxon Heptarch, and completed within about a dozen years subsequent to that event. Thus, this sacred edifice calls us back to very distant times, and opens wide to those who have understanding, the volume of the mental progress of man. But, though the light of those bye-gone days is delightful, it is dim, and we cannot trace the fabric reared at the instigation of Birinus in any other way than by mentally analysing the sublime structure now before us, backward to its more rude begin- nings, It is not unimportant, however, to bear in mind that, by means of Christianity, an intercourse was established be tween the Saxons and the inhabitants of the more cultivated parts of Europe, which led to the improvement of sacred architecture ; and, in this period of improvement, the cathe dral of Winchester was re-built in a superior style, toward the close of the tenth century. St. Ethelwold was both projector and architect; and the curious in such matters, may find some remains of the architecture of his time in the crypts, and portions of the aisles towards the eastern part of the present cathedral. These are of genuine Saxon character, strong and massive, but low and gloomy, indicat ing a people in whom the higher powers of the mind were not yet awakened. They are important, however: the records in stone and lime, are free from many means of vitiation to which written records are subject; and, there fore, they who desire \u2014 and who does not so desire? \u2014 to trace the progress of our nation, from the rudeness of an tiquity to the refinement of the present day, can find a marked epoch in those most ancient portions of this ca thedral. The invasion ancl ruin produced by the Danes, ancl the repairs which followed after they too had been converted \u2014 for the Scandinavian raven soon did homage to the dove of inspiration \u2014 require little notice farther than that, after they particularly settled in the country, this originally ferocious"], [77, "55 CITY OF WINCHESTER. people lost much of their ferocity ; ancl that, while they were gradually assimilated with the Saxons, they probably infused a certain portion of new spirit into the population. As a Norman record, this monumental structure is still more conspicuous ; for much of the pure architecture of that people remains to the present day, and may be seen in the great tower, both transepts, ancl a few detatched portions near the foundation of the body of the structure, not more marked by the ravages of time, than those parts which are of more modern date, though they have been exposed to the action of the weather for full seven centuries and a half. The antiquaries say, that the Norman structure, com- pleted by Walkelin, the first Norman bishop, in the year 1093, was of the same dimensions as the present one. Of this there are evidences apparent to the most ordinary ob- server, who knows that the early Norman buildings have arches of plain semicircles, whereas in the earlier Gothic, the arches are formed by segments of circles intersecting each other at a point, and the later or more ornate Gothic arch is formed by the intersection of curves, not circles but generally logarithmic spirals, which, when they spring from a column or a corbel in an interior, make the roof appear to float in the air as if it had no pressure upon its supports. Were it not that very many of the structures in which it was adopted, are frittered away by an excess of ornament, this is the ne plus ultra of scientific beauty in sacred edifices. It makes the canopy overhead, emblemati- cal of the airy canopy of heaven ; and it deserves to be known, that this is the very principle upon which the at- mosphere is self-suspended in a balance of perfect equili- brium, so as always to be ready to obey the slightest opera- tion of those causes, by the ultimate effects of which the earth is rendered fertile, and the life of every animated crea- ture preserved during its appointed time. None of the arches in Winchester cathedral are purely logarithmic ; but there are some approximations in the more modern parts of the building."], [78, "56 CITY OF WINCHESTER. One thing is worthy of remark, in the circumstance ot the early Norman portions of this cathedral, and even such of the Saxon remains as can be traced, not being more decayed, than even the most recent parts of it, which have had equal exposure to the weather. The tale which this tells is not a tale of simple antiquity, or of the structure or the splendour of churches or other buildings. It is addressed to the inhabitants generally, and addressed to them in every age. An atmosphere which, whether from being loaded with humidity, or with acrid exhalations, corrodes the walls of buildings, must be more severe both upon plants and upon animals, than an air which plays mildly even in its tempest-swell ; and hence, among the most important lessons of wisdom which the view of this cathedral affords us, not the least pleasing is the philosophical conclusion, that the air of Winchester and its vicinity, and the rest of Hampshire \u2014 in so far as that corresponds, is highly favour able to human life, human activity, and human enjoyment, and calculated to impart the greatest wholesomeness and flavour to every article of human food which it produces. To the influential inhabitants of a county whose chief dependence always has been, and from natural circumstances always must be, upon its agriculture, this single and ap parently trifling inference speaks volumes; and, if this is spoken to us by the stones of the cathedral's wall, we shall hear it with additional freshness and power, when we get abroad into the fields, and take a cursory glance of the swelling hills, the smiling valleys, and the glassy streams of this delightful county. The next epoch in the re-building of the cathedral, brings us to the structure as it now exists, and in which, excepting in a portion of the south wall to the eastward of the tran septs, which is not seen from the point of view to which we are alluding, there is no indication that any repair of con sequence will be required for ages to come. In this ex pression of confirmed durability, there is something Wnich accords far better with religious feeling, and breathes"], [79, ""], [80, "WDirt 1AL. \u25a0"], [81, "57 CITY OF WINCHESTER. holier confidence in immortality, than can be produced by what is fresh from the chisel, or what is crumbling through the influence of time ; and when to this we add the sublime massiveness of the building, the impression produced is, that the Christian Religion, and this \u2014 one of its most stately and appropriate of its temples, must endure to the end of time. During the early part of the thirteenth century, the por tion of the edifice to the eastward of the transepts was repaired, or rather re-built, by the prelate, De Lucy ; and, in some particulars, these portions have really a more mo dern character than the western part of the church, because the latter has been, in a great measure, confined to the ancient plan, there being spandrels springing from the buttresses, in those eastward parts, while there are none in the westward ; and indeed no pinnacles, excepting on the north side. The westerly, and by far the most imposing portion of the edifice, was built in the latter part of the fourteenth century, or, between four and five hundred years ago. The builders, that is, those who procured the building, were William of Edington, and William of Wykeham, consecutive bishops of the diocese ; and we need scarcely add, that the latter was the illustrious founder of the Col lege, from which so many eminent men have issued. Edington lived to see the erection of only a small portion toward the western part of the structure, and which is easily distinguishable by some differences in the architec ture. The rest, and by far the most important part, was erected under the auspices of Wykeham. Mass and simpli city are the most striking features of this part of the cathe dral ; and there is an air of duration in them which is not expressed by those more gaudy buildings in which the parts have the appearance of supporting each other. There is reason to believe that much of the massiveness, apparent in the external view, has been produced by casing the original Norman structure, and adapting to it the pointed windows and the clustered mouldings which are so expressive of the VOL. i. o"], [82, "58 CITY OF WINCHESTER. style of the fourteenth century, and which in apparent dura bility and strength are certainly superior to any other style of our sacred architecture. In this respect the west front is a model ; and the entrance doors in particular, which harmo nise very finely with the notion one forms of the comparative magnitude of the three longitudinal sections of a cathedral, are perfect patterns of this style. Having contemplated the exterior, and brought the view doAvn to those massive portals, the desire to enter is strong, and not easily restrained. And why should it\"? The ex- terior of a church or a cathedral, however imposing, or how- ever magnificent, is merely the portion of it which is turned to the world ; and, how far soever it may surpass them in the impression which it makes, it belongs to the common class of earthly things. But when we enter the gates, an emotion comes over us, such as can be produced by no mere percep- tion of the senses. We approach the altar of our God within his own temple. All architectural sublimity is forgot- ten for the moment, and the mind alone \u2014 for the instant disencumbered of the flesh \u2014 is rapt and raised on seraphs' wings, until the impression is that all around is *' Holiness to the Lord.\" But this foretaste of eternal joy is too much for us to dwell upon while encumbered by the clay ; and so, after silently breathing our thanksgiving that \" we also are His offspring,\" we return again to the material part of the subject. But thus returning, there is, in the long-drawn vista, the massive and thickly-serried columns, and the lofty and sublimely-simple roof of the Cathedral of Winchester, an expression of endurance \u2014 a bringing of the earth near to immortality, of which there are few parallels in any part of the world ; ancl in so far as sublimity of form can raise the human affections to this sublime height, they are raised by the simple ancl solitary view of this interior from the great west entrance. The central vista is long, the portion of the altar screen which is visible, is exquisite, and contrasts strongly with the partition which divides the choir from the body of the church ; and the distant window, with its varied"], [83, ""], [84, "Winchester Fueliflud for the Trcp rislcr: Ju.:' TLobbinj. College Strict. II E C-tlmoar. Tut c Library. JBigh . \""], [85, "59 CITY OF WINCHESTER. colours, too remote to be distinctly seen, all conspire to form a view of the most impressive description. If it is in the early morning, and the light of the sun breaking in rainbow beams through this distant window, while grey dawn yet lingers in the nave and aisles, the effect is greatly heighten ed. Then if, when all is still, and not a single footfall echoes through the vaulted expanse, the organ should \" breathe its distant thunder notes,\" then \" swell into a diapason full\" \u2014 \" Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will to the children of men,\" the solemn sound is worth a hundred homilies, to such as are prepared to hold communion of the heart with the God of nature and of grace within his own holy temple. Such feelings have nothing of superstition in them ; for this is a temple without an idol ; and though the senses are carried captive away from the earth, the mind springs up- wards and catches strong hold on Heaven. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the majesty and the antiquity of religious buildings do not conduce to religious feeling, just in the same manner as it is a mistake to suppose that there can be as much patriotic feeling in a colony of yesterday, as in a country whose every scene suggests some recollection of the ancestors of its present inhabitants. A land of stran- gers is proverbial for withering all the more kindly feelings of the human heart, and not merely for withering, but for actually pulling them up by the roots. It is. even so with places of religious worship. Those which are of the clay produce only feelings which pass away with the day, if in deed they produce even these. We are human beings, and before the more heavenward emotions of the mind can have scope to operate with full advantage, we must have some thing to restrain the wandering of the senses. This may, perhaps, be overdone, and the splendour of the altar may deprive us of the benefit of the sacrifice ; but there is no protestant church, or protestant form of worship, by which even an approximation to this is made. Our venerable fanes are resting places for the mind ; and if they were once de- g 2"], [86, "60 CITY OF WINCHESTER. stroyed, and the feelings with which they are associated at an end, the best and dearest of our bands as Englishmen would be broken, and we would be in spirit and in truth, cosmopolites at large, with nothing to restrain us, but the gratification of our bodily appetites, and the desire of worldly possessions, \u2014 the first of which leads directly to animal sensuality, and the second to heartless avarice, destructive of every charitable emotion, and dangerous to common honesty itself. That these are truths, and important truths, no one who reflects for a moment upon them can deny ; but there are many who do not so reflect, and therefore a few brief moralisings may readily be pardoned upon a subject so well calculated to excite such wholesome and kindly emotions, as the cathedral of Winchester. The most splendid view of the interior of this fabric \u2014 one of the most severely sublime that can well be imagined, is unquestionably that from the western extremity of the nave, all the way to the great eastern window, which is the longest cathedral vista in the Island. The closeness of the arches, the depth of their mouldings, the loftiness of the roof, and the simplicity of the whole, have a far more im pressive effect, than if the parts were lighter or more ornate. Externally, there is an air of stability about this structure which one rarely sees equalled ; but this is nothing to the air of stability within. All the arches are so lofty, so narrow, and thus press so directly downwards upon their abutments, that one has no impression of any lateral thrust or strain ; and the independent strength which this gives to every part, produces a feeling of security which is rarely to be met with in buildings of a similar class. Along with sublimity and this feeling of security, simpli city is the grand impression made by the interior of this cathedral. The view which our artist has given ofthe nave, and its pillars, arches, and aisles, as seen obliquely from near the west entrance, will furnish the reader with a very adequate idea of this place, and save us the necessity of"], [87, "61 CITY OF WINCHESTER. going into any minuteness of detail. The view of the south aisle, seen from the same extremity, appears longer than that of the nave, so long indeed as to out-represent the whole length of the cathedral ; but this is an optical decep tion, arising from the narrowness of the aisle. Such an interior harmonises well with perfect simplicity of ornament ; and thus the mural monuments are rather out of keeping with the ancient style of the^ building, only they are so minute, and the building itself is so attractive, that they cannot much offend the eye of any but a small critic who is incapable of feeling the sublimity of the cathedral itself. The tomb and chantry of Wykeham, occupying the space between the fourth and fifth pillars of the southern row, and those of Edington between the ninth and tenth of the same, are in better keeping with the more massy parts, and we feel a respect for them as the monuments of the two great builders of this part of the structure. The tombs and chantries of Bishops Beaufort and Waynflete, behind the capitular chapel, are also splendid monuments appropriately situated ; nor is it easy to pass without notice those of Fox to one's right, and Gardiner to one's left, of the capitular chapel. The tomb of William Rufus, placed as it is nearly in the centre of the choir, is perhaps a little in the way; but still it is an historical remain of some importance. To enumerate all the chantries, and mementoes of many centuries, which are to be seen within this pile, would be foreign to our purpose ; and therefore we must again refer to Dr. Milner, or rather to the cathedral itself, all who can enjoy the pleasure, and we may add the instruction, of visit ing it. But we must not omit to state that the massy cylin drical columns and strong semicircular arches, together with the comparative rudeness, of the Norman transepts, contrast finely with the more sublime character of the Gothic parts of the building. We have been enticed to linger and reflect upon this most interesting edifice, longer than we shall require to do upon any other single object within the county. But we"], [88, "62 CITY OF WINCHESTER. not only feel justified in so doing, but felt it impossible to do otherwise. This cathedral is the only monument of Winchester as the capital city of England, which has come down to us, not only entire, but improved since the court has been removed elsewhere. The castle is razed to its very foundation, and even its fosse is all but obliterated ; the stronghold of the once powerful prelates of Winchester, some of whom held paramount authority over both country and king, is now reduced to a few ivy-clad ruins ; and though some portions of the city walls remain, they are now no longer required, \u2014 the safety of the people, as of those of every other well-constituted district of the country, is in their own loyalty and devotedness to those national in stitutions, which have been tried and hallowed by the ex perience, and through the changes of more ages than those of almost any other people, who have been all the while in a state of progressive improvement. The precinct, or extra-parochial area in which the cathe dral of Winchester stands, contains more than thirty acres ; and it is bounded by parochial grounds on all sides, except ing about one hundred yards of the eastern part of the south side, and here it abuts upon the grounds of the college, which are also extra-parochial. In former times this space surrounding the cathedral, and properly connected with it, contained numerous buildings, few of which now remain ; and those buildings have been subjected to the same succession of vicissitudes, as many of the other buildings, whether royal or religious, which were so characteristic of this city during the Saxon period of our history. An allusion has already been made to the palace of William the Conqueror, as having occupied the space now called the Square, together with a considerable portion of the north-west of the present burying-ground. The only building now remaining within this precinct to the northward of the cathedral, is the small and unostentati ous one, known by the name ofthe Matron's College, founded and 'endowed by Bishop Morley, in 1672, for supporting ten"], [89, "63 CITY OF WINCHESTER. widows of clergymen. In former times, a small chapel stood near the north-west angle of the cathedral, containing the mortal remains of St. Swithun ; but after the bones of the saint were taken within the cathedral, this little chapel lost its sanctity, was in consequence neglected, fell into decay, and not a vestige of it now remains. The same may be said of a more stately edifice \u2014 namely, the New Minster, founded by Alfred, in 898, as a royal sepulchure and chan try, and also as a place of retirement for St. Grimbald. This New Minster was richly endowed, but it seems that two minsters, and two rival sets of monks, chanting with the full fervour of their voices, mutually disturbed each other's devotions ; and accordingly, in the reign of Henry I., in 1110, the monks of the New Minster were tranferred to new lodgings at Hyde, to the northward of the city, near the spot upon which the County Bridewell has been erected \u2014 no inappropriate succession, if we are to believe some of the tales which tradition has handed down, respecting certain portions of the conduct of the holy brotherhood. The south-eastern part of the precinct, which formerly contained the palace of the powerful bishops, fortified ex teriorly by the city wall, and interiorly, or toward the rest of the precinct, by a wall of its own, has been the scene of many changes. When Cromwell made himself master of the city, he treated this episcopal palace in the same manner as he did the castle ; that is, he not only destroyed the fortifica tions, but levelled the structure itself with the ground. It is worthy of remark, that palaces erected in the city, whether in more ancient or more modern times, have been subject to the same fluctuation and decay as monasteries and fortified castles. To the southward of the ivy-clad remains of Wolvesey Castle, and near the chapel, which is a struc ture of comparatively modern date, Bishop Morley began, in 1684, a splendid palace for an episcopal residence. The building proceeded slowly, and was completed by Bishop Trelawny, the successor of Morley ; and after his demise, in 1721, only thirty-seven years after the laying of the founda-"], [90, "64 CITY OF WINCHESTER. tion, and scarcely ten years after its completion it was partially in ruins. The bishops having preferred the Castle of Farnham as their principal country residence, Bishop Morley's palace has disappeared, with the exception of one of the wings, which is still used as an occasional residence of the prelate, when his duties require his presence in Win chester for a succession of days. The only other buildings now remaining within the pre cinct of the cathedral, are those forming the Deanry, some of which are of ancient date; but there is nothing very interesting in their appearance. In respect of every build ing seen from its area, the cathedral may thus be said to \" stand alone in its glory ;\" and this is the most favourable condition in which to view any solemn object, more especi ally if that object is of a sacred character. There is in Winchester another structure, and an institu tion connected with that structure, which stand second only to the cathedral in local importance ; and, making allowance for the difference of their objects, they are perhaps interesting to a wider range of the country. We need hardly say that we allude to WINCHESTER COLLEGE. This institution, for reasons which we shall mention by and by, claims to rank next after the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as a national seminary of education ; and, in respect of antiquity, it is perhaps superior to them both. According to the best authorities, whom there is no reason to doubt, there existed in or near the site of the present college, a temple dedicated to Apollo, which temple was certainly erected before the introduction of Christianity, and in all probability very soon after the Romans had esta blished themselves in this part of Britain. The great Roman annalist, who is himself one of the best of authorities, but who in this case is supported by the collateral testimony of all the others, mentions, that one principal object of the Romans was to abolish the savage worship of the natives, and to substitute their own less"], [91, ""], [92, "i/. 7\"JKE CZOZsi'EE.S Winchester- Published for tfie Proprietor JafRcbbuu College Szrv&t By \u00a3 \u00a3 Ozlmour Puhkc Library Eiyh, Street"], [93, "65 CITY OF WINCHESTER. offensive mythology in its stead. In accomplishing this they appear to have gone judiciously to work, \u2014 to have sought to win proselytes by persuasion, not by persecution, and to have erected their early temples to the milder and more amiable personifications of the pantheon \u2014 as, to Apollo, to Concord, and others of a similar description. There is also reason to believe, that the flamens or priests, who ministered in the temple of Apollo, gave instruction, especially in those more elegant and elevated portions of learning, of which their divinity was the immediate patron ; and thus it is probable, and indeed very likely, that a school of Roman refinement was among the earliest civil institu tions of that people on the banks of the Itchen. That the Romans had recourse to this mode of accelerating the civilisation of the native Britons, is a proof of how well they understood human nature. Poetry and music appear, in all ages and in all nations, to be among the first means by which a people are raised from the sensual grossness of barbarism to something of an in tellectual character. The many countries which the Ro mans overran, and the various people whom they subjected to their yoke, of course gave them much practical experi ence in such matters ; and we are bound to suppose, that it was from their acting upon this experience, that Winchester became thus early a seat of learning. The present college, both in its buildings and its endow ment, is of far more modern date ; but perhaps we should be doing injustice to the ancient conquerors of the world, were we not to consider them as the very first founders of a superior school in Winchester, \u2014 as the planters of a tree of knowledge, the roots whereof have never been wholly dead even in the worst of times, and which now increases in greenness, in beauty, and in fruitfulness, with every revolv ing year. Of course, during the two periods of revulsion to barba rism \u2014 the first invasion by the Saxons and the first by the Danes, the operations of this school, whatever may have VOL. I. H"], [94, "66 CITY OF WINCHESTER. been its nature in those early times, must have been sus pended ; but, as neither of those periods was of long dura tion, and as the national character appears to have been elevated after the conversion of each of those people to the Christian faith, it is highly probable that the quality of the education obtained at Winchester was elevated along with it. Of those primitive ages of a seminary of learning in Winchester, there are however no positive accounts, as our very early chronicles do not furnish us with the progressive history of education. It is certain, however, that natives of England did acquire learning in those days, without go ing out of the country to obtain it ; and, from the metro politan rank of Winchester, education is as likely to have been obtained there as at any other place. It is probable that, in the early times, the priors were the superintendents in matters of education, the ordinary labour of which devolved upon the more intelligent of the monks. Egbert, a monarch of great abilities, selected Helmstad and Swithun, priors of Winchester, to educate his son and suc cessor, Ethelwolph ; and the latter monarch made choice of Swithun as tutor to the celebrated Alfred. Thus, we have evidence that, in the eighth and ninth centuries, Winchester contained a school for kings ; and when we consider that Alfred was as renowned for learning as for valour and pa triotic devotedness to his people, we cannot help being con vinced that a Wykehamist of the present day, who is aware that he treads the same ground which was trodden by that eminent monarch, and receives instruction on perhaps the very same spot where he received it, must feel an interest in education \u2014 a desire not to shame the ancestry of his college, which cannot be inspired in any modern establishment, how richly soever it may be endowed, and whatever may be the talents of its masters. That excitement of the spirit which comes from many generations, and addresses itself to us in the memories of the illustrious dead through the lapse of a thousand years,"], [95, "67 CITY OK WINCHESTER. is a principle of far more power than the unthinking are apt to suppose ; and, in proportion as Winchester College, reckoned from its earliest beginnings, and through all its changes, partakes more of this noble stimulus of ancestry than almost any other in the land, it has an advantage, which they not only do not possess, but which they cannot possibly acquire. We mention this circumstance, because it is a very im portant one, and because it appears to have been very much, if not altogether, neglected by those who have, even with the greatest minuteness of detail, treated of Winchester College. Having done so, we shall not enter into any of the minuti\u00e6 of its history ; only we may mention, that pre vious to the foundation of the present college, this seminary appears to have taken the regular form of a free grammar school, at which Wykeham, the munificent founder of the present college, received at least the early part of his educa tion. This circumstance ought to endear the memory of this great man, not only to all Wykehamists, but to all who wish well to the cause of education, inasmuch as it shews that his splendid endowment of this college, partook much less of a mere ostentatious desire to be handed down as a patron of learning, than of gratitude for the benefits which he himself had received in the pre-existent school, and to which he was no doubt very greatly indebted for the splen dour of his subsequent career. Even now, this college \u2014 called also the college of St. Mary's, Winchester \u2014 is a preparatory and not a completing seminary for the learned. But, it deserves to be borne in mind, that it is in those higher preparatory seminaries, that the foundations of intellectual greatness are laid ; and that, though there may in some instances be a foundation without a superstructure, there can in no instance be a superstructure without a foundation. In this, there is embodied one of the superiorities which Winchester College possesses, namely, the one which arises from its nature, and there are some h 2"], [96, "68 CITY OF WINCHESTER. others resulting from its locality, to which we shall after wards advert. After six years of labour, the buildings of this establish ment were completed, in 1393 ; and, during the Catholic times, the establishment consisted of the warden and ten priests, the head and second masters, seventy scholars, then they have three inferior clerks, and sixteen choristers. The present establishment consists ofthe warden and sub-warden, a head master, a second master, four assistants, a mathema tical tutor, and a teacher of modern languages. The number of foundation, or free scholars, is seventy, the same as origi nally directed by the founder ; and the number of commoners is one hundred and thirty, at an expense of about one hun dred and twenty pounds each in the year. The foundation scholars cannot remain in the college after they are eighteen years old, unless they be descended from relations of the founder, in which case they may remain till they are five and twenty. As this institution was founded as a preparatory school for Wykeham's New College, Oxford, this still continues the main purpose of the foundation part of it. Previous to the summer vacation, the warden and fellows of New Col lege, or such of them as are appointed examiners, repair to Winchester, where, with the warden, sub-warden, and head master, they form a court for the purpose of ascertaining the state of the college, and the qualifications of the candidates for the University. These candidates consist of two of the kin of the founder, if there are any such qualified, and after them the other foundation scholars who are qualified, and who rank in the order of their respective merits, which are carefully ascertained\u2014 indeed they are, as matter of neces sity, known before the time of the formal examination. The candidates whose time is expired, quit the college whether they are or are not successful in their trial for Oxford. These examinations are understood to be both thorough and impartial, so that the prime Wykehamists are boulted"], [97, "69 CITY OF WINCHESTER. out for the University, much in the same manner that prime numbers are boulted out of the arithmetical series by the sieve of Eratosthenes. The classical course at Winchester has long been cele brated, and St. Mary of this city numbers many illustrious men among her sons. The mathematical department has been much increased of late years ; and the teacher of mo dern languages is a recent addition. That those who have the conducting of this venerable and important college, carry out the intent of the founder, both in the letter and the spirit, there is no reason whatever to doubt; and it is equally certain that Winchester has great local advantages for a school of a superior kind, in respect to the studies, the morals, and the health of the students. We need hardly say, that learning will not and cannot flourish if it is overshadowed either by pomp or by wealth. At Winchester there is really nothing to over shadow the college, unless we are to suppose the fact of its being an episcopal city could do this ; and then, that is wholly the other way \u2014 a fostering plant to the seminary, instead of a choking one, in the dark and damp shade of which it would be dwarfed and etiolated. The presence of the cathe dral and its service, with the dean and prebends, and the occasional visits of the prelate, set some of the highest re wards of the orderly and successful pursuit of letters be fore the eyes of the students ; and there is no doubt that hopes have been preserved and strengthened in this way, which, in a more worldly city, would have died down, and given place to others of very different character. In respect to morals, Winchester is not less advantageous for a school. There is not much to attract the minds of the students; and the inhabitants are comparatively so few, that errors can very readily be detected. Then, as to the superior healthiness of the spot, we need scarcely speak, for the simple aspect of the place is more eloquent than any words. The situation is beautiful, and the buildings of the college, have an air of retirement and repose equally power-"], [98, "70 CITY OF WINCHESTER. ful and pleasant. No sooner does one enter the gate, than a sort of literary feeling is excited by the character of the buildings, \u2014 the comparatively small dimensions and snug appearance of which produce an emotion, less sublime, but not less impressive, than that which arises when viewing the massive pillars, lofty arches, and high-suspended roof of the cathedral. In that edifice one feels a desire to be still and to worship : in the college the desire is to open a book and read. Many of the wainscotings and other internal decorations do not harmonise with the ancient architecture ; and the public school, which is comparatively modern, is not in keeping with the rest of the buildings. But architectural unity and congruity are of minor importance here, to what they are in an edifice wholly religious. The oneness, the immutability, and the eternity of religion, are best shadowed forth by a building which is perfect to one model, and which is not changed according to the fashion of the times. In a building, or group of buildings, devoted to education, or to human knowledge in any respect, the case is different. In order that learning may effect all the good which it is capable of effecting, it must in so far adapt itself to the varying tastes of successive ages ; and hence, in as far as buildings are indexes to their uses, that which would offend the eye in a cathedral or a church, may be not only inoffen sive but appropriate in a college or a school. The whole of the buildings belonging to this valuable institution are remarkable for their compactness ; but though in the view of the chapel and library as seen from the cloisters, our artist has grouped those which are visible with much taste, yet in order to be fully appreciated, they must be personally viewed, as well in the general mass as in the details. The buildings of the college, with the exception of the public school-room, are appropriated to the seventy founda tion scholars, who have their dormitories, their refectory, and their ordinary play-ground, exclusively to themselves; and"], [99, "71 CITY OF WINCHESTER. they mingle with the commoners only when they are in the school-room, or when they go enjoy their field-sports on St. Catherine's Hill. The commoners are indeed an addition to the establishment, permitted but not enforced by the institu tion ofthe illustrious founder, and except their education, they do not participate in any of the advantages of the establish ment. Wykeham gave permission \u2014 we believe without any specific limitation either as to numbers or to the subjects studied, for youths of rank and fortune to receive education in the college at their own expense. It is probable that there were such scholars in very early times ; but as they have all along been a private concern of the head-master, no accounts of them are mixed up with the proper records of the college. Whether they were ever accommodated in the dormitories of the establishment is not known, neither is it known at what time they began to lodge in the head master's house, or in the town, though there is great reason to believe, that some of them lodged in the latter, previous to the appropriation of the present buildings to their use. Those buildings were first allotted to them in 1742, by Dr. Burton, who was then head-master of the college ; and we believe it is intended to re-build them in a more commodious style ; but whether for the accommodation of a greater num ber we are not informed, neither are we certain whether the warden has or has not a veto as to the number of those com moners. The buildings which the commoners occupy, includ ing their play-ground, are in the parish of St. Swithun, and not a portion of the extra-parochial precinct of the college. This extra-parochial precinct, contains in all about eigh teen acres, of which the college buildings, with their courts or squares, occupy about four acres, and the rest consists of gardens, play-grounds, and other delightful spots toward the river Itchen. One of the artificial streams into which this river is divided, comes in from the north, passes to the east ward of the buildings, nearly bisects the grounds, turns the College Mill, and afterwards flows onward to the meadows on the south, as one of the principal feeders of the Barton"], [100, "72 CITY OF WINCHESTER. Mill course. Another branch proceeding westward from the top of the canal basin \u2014 the western wharfs of which are on the college grounds, separates the south-eastern quarter of these grounds from the remainder ; and the south side of this quarter is washed by the main stream of the river. These meadows, and especially the play-ground, though but little elevated above the river, are dry and pleasant, and the play-ground especially is very retired. The general ground for field amusement, where both foundation scholars and commoners repair together, on St. Catharine's Hill, is per haps unrivalled by that of any other school in England. It is ample, the turf upon it is peculiarly short and pleasant, the view which it commands is extensive, the air is delight ful, it is within a moderate distance, and there is little temp tation or danger by the way. We have pointed out these, a few of the advantages which Winchester College derives from its local situation, for two principal reasons : \u2014 First, because the country owes some gratitude to this institution for the good which it has already done, by the number of men who have risen to eminence and public value in consequence of an education begun, and a character formed, at this unrivalled school ; and secondly, because it really does appear that, without any departure from the intention of Wykeham, the value of this seminary to the public might be greatly increased. As the formation of the human character is of more importance than the management of it after it is formed, and as this school will at all times naturally receive only such as are to have some influence upon the taste and morals of society in after life, it were highly desirable that it should be rendered as invit ing as possible, and that the branches taught in it, especially to such as are not intended for the university, should be made to bear as much upon public life as possible, especially upon that more valuable department of public life which relates to directing the labours and opinions, and regulating the conduct of those who, from difference of station and cir cumstances, have not enjoyed the same equal advantages."], [101, "73 CITY OF WINCHESTER. Having noticed the two principal subjects of interest in Winchester, namely, the Cathedral within the ancient walls of the city, and the College, situated in the Soke, or free suburbs without, we shall now devote a very few sentences to the ASPECT OF THE CITY. The city of Winchester, of which the view from St. Giles' Hill will give a general notion, lies wholly on the right or western bank ofthe main channel of the Itchen, upon a space of ground level near the river, but rising consi derably toward the west. It is not extensive, \u2014 the High Street which extends very nearly in the direction of east and west, and may be said to bisect the area within the walls, is about half a mile in length, from the east gate to the west gate. The measure in the cross direction is rather less than this, not being much more than four-tenths of a mile. The portion on the south of the High Street is perhaps a little larger than that on the north, but the difference is trifling. The form of the whole has a considerable resemblance to that of a wool pack, girdled in the middle by the High Street ; and though it may be ridiculous to suppose that the two subjects have any relation whatever to each other, yet the form of the city may serve as an artificial memory of its once being the place of wool stapling, and principal mart of the wool trade, both for England and for some portions of the continent of Europe. The circuit of the walls, when these stood entire, was only a very little more than two miles ; and the surface con tained within them was about a hundred and thirty-eight acres, or rather more than one-fifth of a square mile. These are but rude approximations, and we have stated them in round numbers, so that they may be more easily remembered, in order that they may afford a means of comparison between the dimensions of the English capital in the days of the Saxons, and that in the present times. It is true that the suburbs extend to some distance beyond the walls at present, and it is probable that, in the days of the city's meridian VOL. I. I"], [102, "74 CITY OF WINCHESTER. splendour, they extended considerably farther in every direc tion, and especially in the direction across the Itchen, than they do at present ; but still, Winchester never could have been a large city as compared with those of modern date. There are, however, no accounts of its ancient population in which much faith can be placed ; because, in those early times there was a prejudice against numbering the people, lest they should be smitten with the plague, as recorded of the children of Israel when they were numbered by King David. The High Street is of reasonable width consider ing the extent of the city, but the other streets, the chief of which branch off nearly at right angles to the High Street and extend to the walls, are very narrow. Almost one half of the southern division of the city is occupied by the Ca thedral and its grounds, so that, making allowance for the other churches and public buildings and spaces attached to them, barely one hundred acres remain within the walls for the habitations of the citizens. In consequence of being thus limited in space, there are fewer gardens and other openings in Winchester than in most country towns ; but it does not appear that, in modern times at least, this is at tended with any serious injury to the health of the inha bitants. The buildings are no where splendid, (see view of the High Street), and they are snug rather than elegant. There is about them, however, the same expression of an atmos phere free from rotting damps and corrosive miasmata, which we have noticed in the case of the Cathedral, so that, in the very oldest houses, the bricks are not mouldering, neither is the mortar eaten away. In various places, courses of flints and hard mortar are introduced ; but it is doubtful whether such specimens of this kind of masonry are of the same durable character as those remains of ancient walls which are commonly understood to be Saxon. As the situation of the city is not so flat as to admit of water stagnating in the streets, these are moderately clean, though a little infested by the usual evils of towns in chalky"], [103, ""], [104, "Is,,,.,,,.:/., /;,//,.,\u25a0/,,/ fiirthe lro/,n,tr,t . I,, \u25a0 I;../,/,,,,, Colb"], [105, "75 CITY OF WINCHESTER. situations \u2014 dust when the weather is dry, and a little mortar when it is wet ; but in neither of these respects is it very disagreeable. From the peculiar character of the valley above the city, an excellent supply of water of the purest quality is obtained from the river, for all parts, except the more elevated ones toward the site of the ancient castle. The general features of the valley of the Itchen will be noticed afterwards, but we may in the mean time remark that, were it not for the artificial canals, and dams, and water-courses, which have been constructed for the joint purposes of irrigat- ing the meadows, and procuring sufficient falls for the se- veral mills, the river would flow with a rippling current, though a very gentle one, through the whole of this part of its course. Immediately to the northward ofthe suburbs, the western artificial channel which passes along by the Monks- walk and within a little of the Bridewell, is about four- tenths of a mile from the main stream of the Itchen, which is close by the eastern side of the valley. Between these there are various parallel and cross ditches, according as the irrigated meadows have been laid out, and some of those near the town in which the water is kept back from the mills, form small canals for pleasure boats. From the cross ditches, four streams enter the city, the one next the Itchen being larger than the others, and the other three running along three streets, termed respectively the Lower Brook, the Middle Brook, and the Upper Brook. These flow in open channels in some places, while in others they are co- vered; but we believe that generally speaking, the currents in them all are so rapid, that they exhibit no traces of im- purity ; and indeed there are few instances in which water so perfectly transparent is found flowing within the walls of a city. Neither the quantity of water, nor the height of fall obtainable by these water-courses, admits of the appli cation of powerful machinery ; but they answer very well for ordinary flour-mills, of which there are several, both to the east and the south of the city. The upper part, or \"west end\" of the city, as it may be"], [106, "76 CITY OF WINCHESTER. called, consisting of the parish of St. Thomas, and part of the other parishes immediately to the east, does not, at the present time, derive any advantage as to the supply of water, from the \" brooks,\" or otherwise from the Itchen. The case may have been different when the ditch of the city fortifica tion was kept filled with water, and when the part of it to the northward of the west gate was used as a fish-stew for the King, whose palace ancl its grounds then occupied the north-west part of the city immediately within the walls ; but at present the inhabitants are obliged to dig wells. These are about sixty feet deep at Southgate-street, and one hundred and fifty feet at the Barracks, or King's House, on the top of the hill where the castle formerly stood. The water obtained at these wells, is as pure, transparent, and free from earthy salts, as that of the river; and, in proportion as the wells require to be dug to a greater depth, the supply which they afford is more certain and copious in dry wea ther. This may be expected, as chalk-beds abound most in vertical fissures near the surface, and thus the water of a shallow well is obtained from a less extent, and more subject to surface contingencies, than that of a deep one. It has been proposed, and indeed it would be highly de sirable, that there should be a reservoir, at the most elevated part of the city, kept constantly full to be ready in case of fires, it being difficult to supply engines from the deep wells. It might perhaps have been desirable to have had the pumps for such a reservoir near either the Bridewell or the Work house of the Union ; because the working of the pipes would have afforded not an unwholesome exercise for the inmates of either of those places. But the Bridewell is on the low grounds near the meadows, and the Work-house is at a dis tance and cut off by the Southampton and London Railway, the excavation for which will in all probability affect the supply of water in its vicinity. The city of Winchester, once the capital of England and the seat of a pretty extensive trade, for neither of which it is well adapted from its situation, is now in much better"], [107, "ll'IXt 'III I IT I, I i , Hi.,/, XI,,, I"], [108, ""], [109, ""], [110, "DDL1 slTY MALL , WINCHESTER Winchester. h,i.l,,:\u201e,l ,.,. /!< flropruttn 7a?

Its Cathedral and its Col lege, and the fact of its being metropolitan to a rich agricul tural county, will always secure to it a certain degree of respectability, as well as a reasonable share of county trade ; and though it has no chance of those rapid movements in prosperity which give occasional impulses to manufacturing towns, and draw towards them a large population ; yet it is equally free from the reverses to which they are subject, and that misery and mischief of a loose population with which those reverses are attended. It is, in fact, a place for the enjoyment of human life, and not for its mere waste ; and there is a sweetness of repose about such places, for which the bustle and the anxiety even of rapid money-making can but ill compensate. The country around it, though not rank, so as to sicken the air with the excess of animal and vegetable decomposition, is yet rich, and all the products of the soil are of the choicest quality. Coal, the only first necessary of life which is not produced in the district, can be brought to the city by water carriage ; and considering the length of the transit, and the hazards of some parts of the navigation, the price is not extravagant. Winchester is in short not a place to make a fortune, but it is one in which time may be agreeably spent, and a family reared and to a considerable extent educated to great ad vantage. PARLIAMENTARY EXTENT.\u2014 WARDS AND PARISHES. The Parliamentary Boundaries of Winchester, as esta blished by the Municipal Corporation Act, probably exceed the limits of the suburbs even when the city contained the greatest number of inhabitants; at least it appears to be greater in the north and south direction, though it does not extend so far eastward as the buildings of the ancient Soke. The \"Liberty,\" as we may call it for the sake of shortness \u2014"], [112, "78 CITY OF WINCHESTER, though the inhabitants of the ancient city considered it as anything but a Liberty, inasmuch as it has saddled them with county rates from which they were formerly exempted \u2014 a casualty which has happened to this city and to the town of Portsmouth, and to no other place within the county of Hants ; \u2014 this Liberty is an irregular six-sided figure, with one of its more acute angles directed up the valley of the Itchen, and the other down that valley. The upper point is on the Basingstoke road, about half a mile from the city, and the under point on the Southampton road, about a mile and a quarter from the same; the length of this, the longest dimension of the Liberty, being about two miles and a quar ter, and the greatest breadth in the cross direction, being about one mile and a quarter. The Liberty thus includes Hyde on the north, and St Cross on the south, with ample room for the extension of both villages for centuries to come. The extent eastward is not above the fifth of a mile beyond the Soke bridge; but that on the westward is more exten sive. The ground here is more elevated than in any other part of the suburbs, and there are accordingly more houses of recent erection. The boundaries are easily known, the angles being in general at remarkable points, and the lines joining those points nearly straight. The north-west side, from the Basing stoke road to the Week road, is rather more than five fur longs; the west side about a mile and a half; and the south west, to the Southampton road, about three furlongs, The south-east side, to the Bishop's Waltham road, is rather more than a mile; the east to the village of Winnall, but with an angle at the Alresford road, about a mile ; and the north-east from Winnall to the Basingstoke road, about five furlongs, Thus taking a rude estimate, the circuit of the Liberty is between five and six miles, and includes within it about one square mile and a half. The Southampton Railway passes for about a mile and three quarters through the western part, approaching within 150 yards of the west gate, and half that distance ofthe King's House; and, at no great distance from"], [113, ""], [114, "Wuichesta: PiiHishe,? for the Jr-.rpnetftr J,i 'Sobbzns /'/ij/eae Stryrt. r"], [115, "79 CITY OF WINCHESTER. the Week road, the Railway \"crops out,\" thus affording a convenient spot for a terminus both ways. The whole population within the boundaries, as now briefly traced, may be estimated at about ten thousand, which is very small as compared with the number of parishes ; and numerous as these latter are, they are but a small frac tion of the sixty-four parishes, or at all events places of wor ship which are enumerated by Bishop Pontissera toward the close of the thirteenth century, and by Wykeham about a century after. In those days however, religion was in some respects a trade, while at present it is much more of a devo tional character. There are now four parishes wholly, and two partially within the circuit of the ancient walls, and nine others wholly or partially within the parliamentary boundary, exclusive of the extra-parochial grounds of the Cathedral, the College, and St. Cross. The parishes within the walls are as follows: \u2014 St. Mau rice in the north-east; St. Peter Colebrook between St. Maurice and the Wolvesey grounds ; St. Mary Kalendar to the west of St. Maurice; and St. Lawrence, a very small parish, to the south-west of St. Mary. Those partially within the walls are, the small parish of St. Swithun, lying along the southern boundary of the cathedral precinct; and St. Thomas, considerably the largest of the city parishes, occupying the whole western part of the city, the site of the King's House, and the country to a considerable distance beyond. Notwithstanding this apparent excess of parishes, there is no excess of church-room for the inhabitants. St. Peter and St. Mary, have no churches, the parishioners being attached to the church of St. Maurice, in which there is not comfortable accommodation for them, and thus they are dri ven to the Cathedral \u2014 or elsewhere. Besides the churches belonging to the establishment, there are various meeting houses for Dissenters, which in all probability profit by that want of church room to which we have alluded. The chief are, \u2014 a Catholic chapel in St. Peter's Street, an Indepen-"], [116, "80 CITY OF WINCHESTER. dent one in Parchment Street, a Baptist in Silver Hill, a Wes leyan in Parchment Street, and an Association Wesleyan in the parish of Hyde. It is perhaps worthy of remark with regard to the latter, that the same building was once a school of much celebrity, at which the illustrious George Canning received his early education ; and that, at the present time, (1838,) it is alternately a Mechanic's Lecture Room and a Methodist Chapel. The other parishes wholly or partially within the parli amentary boundary are, St. Michael on the south ; St. Peter Cheesehill on the south-east; and St. John on the east; all of which abut on the city, contain a good many inhabitants, and comprise the chief part of the Soke which is peopled at the present time. Winnall, with the very minimum of a church and church-yard, occupies a small portion on the north-east part. St. Bartholomew Hyde extends over the meadows from the city wall to the extreme north, and from the main stream of the Itchen to the Andover road. Then follows a portion of Week, containing some new streets and the Union work house. All the remainder of the Liberty, to the west and south, on the right of the Barton Mill stream, and that of the Itchen, is occupied by the parish of St. Faith; and the southern meadows on the left bank of the river are occupied by the Vill of Milland, and two patches of the parish of Chilcombe. These parishes and portions of parishes, whether within or without the walls, are (for parliamentary and burghal purposes, but not for any others,) arranged into three wards, the compositions and valued rentals of which are as follows : WARD OF ST.

In the whole Borough 530 POOR RATES.\u2014 NEW POOR LAW. As we have spoken of the rental of the different parishes and portions of parishes within the parliamentary boun daries of Winchester, it affords us the opportunity of offer ing one or two brief remarks upon this much disputed subject, and on the difference of its effect in towns of steady population such as Winchester, and the agricultural districts. We shall put aside all temporary expenses, such as the erec tion of buildings, and confine ourselves to the actual cost of supporting the establishment and the poor, whether the relief given to the latter be in-door or out-door. There are in all thirty-three parishes comprehended in the Winchester Union, which may be said to be exclusively country or agri cultural parishes, with the exception of those immediately connected with the city. There are no doubt villages in some of them, but those villages are in general so small, as not materially to change from their agricultural charac ter the parishes in which they are situated. Now, previous to the passing of the new Act, it appears by the published statements, that the average annual assessment for the poor of the whole thirty-three parishes was 10,074/. The ex penditure for the year ending March 23rd, 1838, was 7,118/. of which 5,254/. was for out-door relief of the poor, 837/. for subsistence and clothing within the house, and 1,027/. for the whole expenses of the establishment as regards the out door and the in-door relief, the apportionments to the diffe rent parishes, and every other item. If this year were to be taken as the average, it would show a reduction of 2,956/. VOL I, K"], [118, "82 CITY OF WINCHESTER. upon the annual rate of the thirty-three parishes, since the new law came into operation, or a reduction of 29 per cent. on the total expense of maintaining the poor. It does not appear that, notwithstanding this reduction of the cost, the poor have been subjected to any peculiar hardship. No reasonable complaint seems to have been made even among themselves ; and they certainly are not subjected to any very rigid imprisonment in the house of the Union, as the amount of out-door relief is more than five times the expense of maintenance in-doors, which latter amounts to 6/. a quarter for each parish on the average. The parishes vary much in size, and still more in population ; and though, except such as arise from differences of years and seasons the fluctu ations cannot be great, yet there must be some, \u2014 as the condition of human beings is every where liable to contin gencies, against which no human foresight can provide. The principal means by which to account for this seduc tion of rates in the Winchester Union must be, increased industry on the part of those agricultural labourers who for merly derived a considerable portion of their subsistence from the rates ; and there being, as we have said, little complaint of hardship, this is demonstrative evidence of a more wholesome state of this part of the population \u2014 a de cided progress in the elevation both of their minds and their morals ; for, if the one of these is elevated, the other is rais ed along with it, as is proved by the case of the more moral and enlightened ranks of society. To enter upon an analysis of all the thirty-three parishes composing the Union would be foreign to our purpose, though a veiy useful duty on the part of those who have the manage ment of the Union itself, or are personally interested in the local prosperity of the district. We may however mention in round numbers the change which has taken place in a parish or two. The assessment for the parish of St. Tho mas in Winchester was 955/. before the passing of the new law ; and the present charge to that parish for the poor and the expenses of the establishment, is 671/. This is an"], [119, "83 CITY OF WINCHESTER. instance of a parish partly burghal and partly agricultural. In the parish of St. Maurice the assessment under the old law was 563/., and the expense of the establishment and maintenance under the new law is 590/., which is an in crease of about 5 per cent. This is a parish wholly burghal, and one which perhaps contains a greater proportional num ber of poor than any other within the city of Winchester. Mitcheldever is a parish exclusively agricultural. Now the average assessment for it under the old law was 971/., while under the present system it is 535/., or not much more than 55 per cent, of what it was then. The country parishes vary a little ; and it should seem that the reduction of rate has been greatest in those parishes where the valued rental bears the highest proportion to the number of inhabitants, though, not in the same proportion as the rental exceeds the population. Thus in the parish of Mitcheldever, above sta ted, the valued rental is upwards of 9/. to each inhabitant, while that in Twyford is about 3/. 10s.; and the saving of rate in Mitcheldever is 4 per cent, more than the other, the proportion being about 45 in the case of the first named pa rish, and 41 in that of the second. It is to be understood that all these calculations are founded upon the official re turns of the sums actually expended on the poor and the establishment, for four consecutive quarters, the last ending March 1838 ; and not on the amounts which may have been collected under the name of \" poor' rates.\" The four parishes which we have selected in illustration of the effect of the alteration of the poor laws, form a regular series, and may be taken as a pretty fair average of the county. St. Maurice is wholly a burghal parish, containing numerous poor, and the actual cost of their maintenance is very nearly an eighth part of the whole valued rent. St. Thomas contains fewer poor in proportion, and a conside rable part of it is agricultural ; and the cost of the poor for it is about one-fourteenth part of the valued rent, or rather more than half that of St. Maurice. Twyford is a rural parish, but one in which there is an inhabitant to every three or k2"], [120, "84 CITY OF WINCHESTER. four pounds of the valued rent; and here the expense of the poor, which was formerly more than a sixth of the valued rent, is now little more than a tenth. In Mitcheldever, where the population is about two-thirds less in proportion to the rent than in Twyford, the old rate was more than one-ninth of the rental, whereas the total expense of the poor is not now much more than one-sixteenth. Thus, in a parish which is wholly burghal and contains many poor, there has been an increase of expense under the new law. In St. Mary Kalendar, which borders on St. Maurice, and is also wholly burghal, but does not contain so many poor, there has been a reduction of 12 per cent. In St. Thomas which is partly rural, and does not contain many poor in the burghal part, there has been a reduction of 29 per cent.; there has been 41 per cent, in Twyford, which is rural, and populous in proportion to the rental ; and 45 per cent, in Mitcheldever, where the population is small in proportion to the rent, and consequently the farms large. Thus, the chief reduction has been in the great farming districts ; and it has, in all probability, arisen from a change highly beneficial to the character of the labourer, namely that of paying him wholly in wages, instead of partly in wages and partly out of the rates. In all probability, the amount paid by the farmer to each labourer that he employs, is not less than it was when part of it was paid out of the parish rates, and it may be that it is more; but this is not the question. The able-bodied labourer is now an independent man and not a pauper; and the country will soon feel, if it does not already feel, the advantages of this change. While degraded as a pauper, his object \u2014 like that of beggars of all classes, must have been to get as much in charity, and do as little work, as possible. A system like this, could hold out no inducement to the workman to become expert, but rather the contrary, as the bad and lazy labourer always partook most largely of the public bounty \u2014 or alms. But, when the whole are supported by wages, the superior workman will, as h e ought to do, get the advantage; this will be seen by"], [121, "85 CITY OF WINCHESTER. the others; and they will be stimulated to improvement. In this way, the value and the wages of the labourer will be both gradually raised; and the productiveness of the country will increase in a still higher ratio. A skilful servant, whose heart is to his work, and who is appreciated and rewarded accordingly, can do much more to increase the productiveness of a farm, and lessen many of the expenses of its management, than they who are conversant with servants of an opposite character only can possibly be aware of. As there are no peculiar circumstances which can make the case of those agricultural parishes very different from that of the majority of the others within the county, it will not be necessary to revert to this subject, except in occasional hints. We shall, therefore, now proceed to matters which are more local in their character and application, with only one passing remark on the state of the churches of Winchester, at the close of the civil war, when the city and everything connected with it appear to have been reduced to the low est ebb. As it had been a regal and episcopal city from the begin ning, and as such, warmly attached to the interests both of the king and the church, the vials of republican indignation were poured out upon it in no stinted measure ; and, as Cromwell levelled the fortifications, so the troops left in the city appear to have been equally busy in defacing and de stroying the churches ; while it appears that the inhabitants, unable to repair those structures, degraded them to the most irreverend purposes. After the Restoration, there was a good deal of crimination and re-crimination upon this subject; and a pamphlet (now rarely to be met with), which was printed in London in 1660, the year in which the bishopric of Winchester was restored after having been ten years^in abeyance, mentions that the church of St. Peter's, in Macel lis, had been \" a very ruinous heap of rubbish,\" for a hun dred years, and \" a longer time ;\" that the Kalendar Church (St. Mary's) though in the High Street, in the very centre of the city, had not been a place of worship \" within the"], [122, "86 CITY OF WINCHESTER. memory of man,\" and that it was then a lay-stall for offal of the most offensive description ; that the \" little church\" of St. Clement's, having been much delapidated while the sol diers occupied it as a guard-house, was used as \" a place to lay faggots in, yea to keep hogs in, and wherein to receive oxen, horses, &c. at times of fairs ;\" and that St. Swithun's was ruinous, and \" let to one Robert Allen, his wife deliver ed of children at one end thereof, and a hog-stye made of the other.\" The St. Swithun here mentioned, is not the little church near the King's gate, but the one which stood in the Upper Brook \u2014 a third one in St. Peter's Street ap pears to have vanished before that time. It was soon after this that the great plague broke out in Winchester; and there is little reason to doubt that it was greatly aggravat ed, if not originally caused, by the filthy state of the city, of which the ruins of these churches were a specimen. It is to cleanliness, more than to anything else, that we, in modern times, are indebted for the comparative mildness of epidemics, and their freedom from that virulent putrid character, which once was so fatal in England, and is still so destructive in some parts of the world. CORPORATION, COURTS, &c. Since the change in the municipal law for corporations, the corporate officials of Winchester are, two Aldermen and six Councillors for each of the three wards, from and by whom the Mayor, the only magistrate in the council, is elected; and six other magistrates act along with him, or without him, as may happen, in matters of the city police, which is separate from that of the county or the district. The county magistrates hold their adjourned or petty ses sions in the city weekly, and quarter sessions at the usual times, for the decision of all matters to which their juris diction extends ; and the conduct of these appears to be ju dicious, lhe county assizes are also held in the city, during the spring and summer circuits. The calendars at these are not heavy, considering the extent of the county ; and, of the"], [123, "CITY OF WINCHESTER. 87 summary convictions at the petty sessions, a very conside rable proportion are for offences against the game laws, a species of crime which may be expected to decrease, as the labourers are more constantly employed at wages and less dependent upon the parishes. The city is entitled to have a Court of Record for the whole extent of its parliamentary liberties ; but owing to some cause or other, the inhabitants do not at present (1838) enjoy the benefit of this very useful local court. There is indeed, a local court, before which pleas to any amount may be brought, and which sits on every Thursday, unless that happens to be a \" red letter day\" in the Kalen- dar. This is the Cheyney Court, which sits in the \" Close,\" within the deanery, and near King's gate, and has jurisdic- tion over 201 parishes, tythings, and places, some of them close to Winchester, and others at the distance of thirty miles ; but none of them within the parliamentary limits of the borough, excepting St. Faith, Chilcombe, the parishes in the Soke and the parish of Week, so far as the boundaries include these. There is only one bailiff or judge to this court, usually a barrister, though that is not necessary. There is a clerk of court ; and there are twelve attorneys, in the name of which all proceedings in the court may be carried on ; but there is a rule of court enjoining them to \" make proper allowances,\" to such other attorneys as may bring business to the court. The bailiff's office is held for life by patent under the Bishop ; the clerk is appointed by the same ; and the attorneys are nominated by the bailiff, during life or lawyer-like behaviour. This court is rather tardy in its proceedings, owing to its being held only one day in the week, and the \" red letter saints\" coming in to make blanks in that ; but it is in contemplation to hold another meeting weekly, by which the velocity of justice will of course be doubled. An appeal lies from its decisions to the court of King's Bench, but such appeals are not more frequently made than from the other inferior courts. Pro cess before it is not expensive ; and thus, after the increase"], [124, "88 CITY OF WINCHESTER. of sittings takes place, it will be of increased value, by en abling those within its jurisdiction to obtain justice cheaply and judiciously, without going out of the county for it, or waiting the slow return and comparatively hurried proceed ing, of the assizes. Situated as Winchester is, in the centre of a rich agricul tural district, in which there are many substantial farmers, and a considerable number of the proprietors are resident, the local trade is considerable, and it is of the best kind, namely, that between permanent dealer and customer, whose interests are thus more intimately blended and more reci procal, than if there were a larger trade consisting of chance sales. The supply of country produce is abundant, excellent, and not extravagant in price. It is brought to the public mar ket every Wednesday and Saturday, directly by the original growers, and thus the articles are always fresh, and there is only one profit upon the sale of them. A small fee is, we believe, exacted from those who bring produce to this mar ket; but as this can yield only a trifle, it would be creditable to the city, advantageous to the inhabitants, and a great encouragement to cottagers and other small growers, if it were entirely abolished. A Corn-market is held every Saturday, in a handsome building, recently erected in a wide part of Jewry Street as a private speculation. It is both a pitch and a sample market ; and agricultural implements are regularly exposed for sale, so that the farmers can obtain such of these as they want with very little trouble, at the same time that they dispose of the produce of their farms. This market is well situated, inasmuch as carriages from the country can reach it without passing through any of the crowded streets ; and it is near that part of the town upon which the roads converge from the districts affording the largest supply. Still the corn trade is, like the other trades, only a local one, the chief purchasers being the millers along the line of the Itchen. The sheep fairs, though not very extensive are well atten-"], [125, ""], [126, "DHL , WOKIGOOESTEIR - Winchester. I),/,/,.,/,,,/ far rl,, /t.y.,,,,,,- ,., \u2022 I:.. ,,!.,\u201e.. rll/.,/.

They are held in the \" fair close,\" or \" Oram's Harbour,\" which occupies the most north-westerly part of St. Thomas parish, and used to be easily accessible from the Stockbridge road which enters the city by the west gate. The South ampton Railway has done serious injury to this close, and spoiled as a situation for villas, the proximate part of the Stockbridge road, which is perhaps the best natural situation for such erections in the vicinity of Winchester. The xailway cuts the road too obliquely to permit the erection of a sightly bridge ; and, instead of giving the road a contrary flexure so as to make it cross the railway at a manageable angle, the road has been fairly cut asunder, and the passage to the fair close and also to Stockbridge, rendered as circuitous and clumsy as bungling could well make them. This is the more to be regretted that, if the railroad is to give any im pulse to Winchester in the way of additional building and trade, it has mangled the chief spot, \u2014 we may say the only spot, immediately adjoining the city, the natural situation of which adapts it for profiting by this impulse. Of the social and intellectual state of Winchester, we are not called upon to express an opinion. The general cha racter is quiet respectability, and a remarkable absence of that squalid misery which is found in the streets of towns having a loose and fluctuating population. The schools are respectable, and well suited to the place ; and there are, a Public Library well supplied and used, and a Subscription Reading Room well attended. Public amusements are not numerous : there is a Theatre, but it is not often open ; and there is also a public Race-ground at some distance north of the city. There is no popular institution for literature, sci ence, or any other subject calculated for teaching \"the old idea how to shoot\" \u2014 or how to blossom and bear fruit after it has shot, except a Mechanics' Institution; and that pro bably follows the general law of these institutions, in giving exhibition lectures upon all subjects except such as would be really useful to those who attend. There are a few points more that might claim our atten- VOL. I. L"], [128, "90 CITY OF WINCHESTER. tion, were we treating only of Winchester ; but as we have the whole county before us we must husband our space. HYDE.\u2014 ST. CROSS. These are the only places within the parliamentary boun daries, and not absolutely connected with the city, which claim any particular notice ; and the first of them may be very briefly discussed, as being an immediate suburb of Winchester, rather than having any peculiar or marked cha racter of its own. St. Bartholomew Hyde is a parish containing a con siderable population, the chief part of which is comprised in the village, and extending along the Basingstoke road for about half a mile from the north-west corner ofthe city where it begins. The village is wholly within the borough, but the parish is not, though the portion within has a rental of 2400/. The poor rates before the alteration, averaged about 12 per cent, on this rental, and since then, they have fallen about 14 per cent, of their own amount. At present the village contains no object of any great in terest, though there are some tolerably good houses ; and the walk by the canal towards the meadows is very pleasant. In former times, Hyde was a place of much more note. When Bishop Henry of Blois, in 1110, removed the monks of the New Mynstre from the cathedral precinct, and along with them the bones of King Alfred and St. Grimbald, Hyde was chosen as the site of the new monastery, no doubt on ac count of the pleasantness of its situation. About 32 years after its erection, during the civil wars between King Ste phen and the Empress Maud, this abbey was burned down ; but it was soon afterwards re-built in a style more splendid than ever. The bones of Alfred, endeared as his memory justly is to the country, and the bones of the canonised Grimbald \u2014 still more precious in the eyes of the monks, could not, however, avert the fate of this building. It is now wholly gone ; and instead of the sacred bones of an cient saints, the lachrymose antiquary meets with the pe-"], [129, ""], [130, "sftr. tublukci r'or the 3vjtnetor JafSoiHaj? College Street. \u2022 i.~ (h.'mour.Hibltc Library High Street."], [131, "91 CITY OF WINCHESTER. nance-doomed flesh of modern sinners. A few small frag ments may yet be seen ; but they have no modern use, and their ancient use has become problematical. A considerable number of years ago, a stone having the name of Alfred was dug up among those ruins which have now disappeared, and at different periods, various other remains of the olden time have been met with. Toward the close of the eighteenth century, when the ground was cleared out for the present buildings, various stone coffins were found, some of them lined and also cased externally with lead ; but to whom they, or any of them, may have belonged, was not ascertained. The parish church is but a homely structure, apparently built, for the most part, of the fragments of some more splen did and ancient edifice ; and probably they are a portion of the materials of the Abbey, though the greater part of these are said to have been removed for the purpose of building Stratton House. As the village of Hyde depended chiefly upon its Abbey, the breaking up of that establishment was followed by the same decline which fell upon all the abbey villages throughout the kingdom ; but, probably from being on the line of a great thoroughfare, it does not appear to have been so long in reviving as those in more sequestered places. At present, it partakes of the same steady charac ter as the ancient city to which it is a suburb. St. Cross, though it never was the seat of monastic pomp and wealth, is now a place of more interest than Hyde. It is so far from Winchester, and so detached from it by meadows and grounds, which are open or only spotted with a house here and there, that it has a distinct character of its own. The buildings of the Hospital are entire, and in complete repair, or rather they have that appearance of durability to which we alluded when noticing the cathedral ; they do not appear to have been repaired, or to stand in need of any ; and the houses of the village, which are of a plain rustic character, are clustered on the Winchester side of the hospital, are by no means an inappropriate appendage. The hospital buildings themselves, as may be seen by the l2"], [132, "92 CITY OF WINCHESTER. view from the adjoining meadows, form a very interesting pictorial group ; and the interest does, not fall off upon a nearer approach. Indeed, to those who love to trace the progress of that sacred architecture, which is the only ar chitecture properly suited for solemn subjects in a climate like England, St. Cross presents advantages such as are not often to be met with. It is true that the hospital of St. Cross is not one of the oldest buildings in or about Winchester, the founder being Bishop Henry of Blois, who transported the monks of the New Mynstre to Hyde, and built the palace or castle of Wolvesey ; but this little retreat for the aged and the re duced, remains entire, while the pomp of the abbey and the strength of the palace have, for ages, been laid in the dust. The delightful spot upon which the hospital stands, had not, indeed, escaped the notice of ecclesiastics \u2014 who were peculiarly acute in finding out \" the pleasant places of the land\" for their habitations. But the first monastery was sacked and razed by the Danes, as early, probably, as the tenth century ; and it does not appear to have been re-built, or any public structure erected on its site, until De Blois instituted this hospital, about seven hundred years ago. The original institution was for thirteen poor men, who were to be resident, and to be well fed according to the fashion of the times ; also, in order that they might moisten their clay according to the copious measure then in use, each was al lowed \" a gallon and a half of good small beer per diem.\" In order to relish their \" gallon-and-half,\" they were allowed \" wastel-bvead/ or ale-cakes \u2014 which were in fashion till the time of Shakspeare. \" Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,\" says Sir Toby, \" that there shall be no more cakes and ale T We may remark, en passant, as the etymo logies are a little untoward, that this same \"wastell\" or \" wassail,\" is derived from the common wiss heel \u2014 \" wish health,\" which was used by our Saxon ancestors as a stimu lus to potation ; and it should seem that the very name of the beverage, \u0153l. \" ale,\" meant \" health,\" just as the com-"], [133, "93 CITY OF WINCHESTER. mon names of ardent spirits in most countries are syno nymes for water of life \u2014 aqua-vit\u0153, eau-de-vie, uisgh-na bhae, fye. , Besides the thirteen poor men unable to maintain them selves, who were kept permanently within the hospital, a hundred others, the most indigent, of good character, that could be found within the city of Winchester, were to have three quarts of small beer, a loaf, and \" two messes\" each, daily, in a hall provided for that purpose, and which was called \" hundred men's hall.\" Whatever portion of their daily allowance any of this hundred men could not consume in the hall, they were to carry with them to Winchester. But whether this part of the institution tended more to the promotion of charity or of indolence, the data are too scanty for ascertaining. Besides these pauper residents and visi tors, there were members of a higher caste, \u2014 a master, a steward, and four chaplains, thirteen clerks, and seven cho risters, with the requisite number of servants. The hospital, which was at the first under the superin tendance of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, was not very well conducted ; but Wykeham took it under his care, and he appears to have had both the skill and the means for ensuring success to all that he took in hand. Cardinal Beaufort was so much pleased with the state in which the management had been placed by Wykeham, that he so augmented the endowments as that forty additional persons were accommodated, namely, two additional priests, thirty-five more poor brethren, and \u2014 with a tenderness of consideration, which reflects great credit on his memory, and helps to take off the bitterness of Shakspeare's \" He dies and makes no sign,\" \u2014 three hospital nuns, for the bene fit of the sick brethren. Besides thus amply and kindly augmenting the establishment of the hospital, Beaufort greatly improved, and indeed in great part re-erected the buildings ; and this accounts for the Gothic architecture of the fourteenth century being, in many parts of this inter esting group, supraposed upon the heavy Norman of the"], [134, "94 CITY OF WINCHESTER. twelfth, as it had been erected by Henry of Blois. Beau fort was still more discriminating in his appropriation of this charity, The intimate knowledge, which great acute ness and long experience had given Beaufort, of all the ups and downs of the world, enabled him to discriminate who were the really helpless objects of charity ; and he accord ingly fixed upon broken-down gentlemen, as being those who have the smallest chance of regaining their status, and upon whom the reverses of life fall with the greatest bitter ness. This very considerate direction of Beaufort is, we believe, kept up at the present time ; and those who find a calm retreat in the evening of life within the hospitable gate of St. Cross, are chiefly such as have seen better days, but who have fallen into the world's neglect, by misfortune, or that indescribable decay against which no human fore sight can guard, and not by crime or profligate extrava gance. These are the men to whom the grief of decline is most gloomy. Such as sink from affluence to penury by dissipated courses have, in general, their feelings so much debased in their progress, that they are equally callous to suffering, and unworthy of relief. But those who keep up the tone of their minds, and struggle virtuously, are in a very different condition ; and if men of any description are, more than others, the object of genuine charity, these are they. In the earlier ages of English history, reverses of this kind were much more frequent than they are at present, and means of recovery, by the exertions of the individual himself, were comparatively few, \u2014 so that many elemo synary institutions, which in our days would pander to idle ness and favouritism, were at that time real charities. Whether the brethren of St. Cross are always all of the class of persons who ought to find an asylum within the hospital, is not a point for our decision ; we can only say that those who are there have the conduct of gentlemen, and that their habitations are snug and comfortable. We believe that, as is usual in analogous institutions \u2014 there are none similar to this in the kingdom \u2014 the Master"], [135, ""], [136, "Winchester aioltshed- fi>r '/if Bii/irtetor Ta? i>.i//lin\\ <.,/7,,j, Street \u25a0 \\ Gitmoui Mitt Library ffiyA"], [137, "95 CITY OF WINCHESTER. of the Hospital, who is at present the Reverend and Right Honourable the Earl of Guildsord, comes in for \" the lion's share\" of the annual revenues and the fines ; but still the thirteen resident brethren live at their ease, and in compa rative affluence. Each brother has three apartments, with a separate garden ; and they are allowed to have their families within the walls, and to carry on their trades or professions, of which they have the sole benefit, besides their hospital allowance, which averages about 100/. a year. We have already alluded to the delightful spot upon which St. Cross is built, and the symmetry, congruity, and beauty of the buildings, as a pictorial group, \u2014 of which our artist's view from the north-east gives a faithful repre sentation ; and, we may further remark, that the interest of the buildings becomes the greater, the more nearly and closely they are examined. These buildings are very different from those of charitable institutions of more modern date, where the exterior is splendid and inviting, and the interior mean and disappoint ing \u2014 if not absolutely repulsive. The principal entrance is by a large gateway in a plain wall on the north side \u25a0 and the kitchens on the left, and brew-house on the right of the first court, have nothing to recommend them but their an tiquity. The latter was once the \" hundred men's hall,\" in which that number of non-resident mendicants formerly re ceived their daily allowance ; but this has fallen into de suetude, and in lieu thereof, the portress at the inner gate now supplies such as call for that purpose with a horn of ale and slice of bread. The tower over the second gateway is of fine proportions, and still contains a figure of Cardinal Beaufort, in one of three niches, but the other two are empty. Within this gate is the second court, or square, whAh is finely turfed, and ornamented with flowers in the borders, and vines, fig trees, and other plants, on various parts of the walls. The refectory and apartments of the master, occupy the north side, westward, of the tower ; the chambers of the brethren"], [138, "96 CITY OF WINCHESTER. the west side ; the ambulatory or cloister, with rooms over, formerly occupied by the sick and the nursing nuns, the east side ; and the church the eastern part of the south, the western part of that side being open to the meadows. Ad ditional chambers once closed in this part ; but their removal has let in the sun and the south wind, and contributed not a little both to the beauty and healthiness of the place. The exterior of the church and chambers, the view of the meadows, and the general effect of the square, are faithfully represented in the plate. To the lover of architecture, and to him who wishes to trace the progress of English taste from remote times, in the memorials which the men of those times have left in their works, the church of St. Cross is the most interesting build ing in the group. It belongs wholly to the hospital ; but the inhabitants of the village use it by way of sufferance ; and indeed it is the only church which the people of St. Faith parish are permitted to attend, they having no church of their own. As a place of worship, this church has nothing to recom mend it. The part divided off for this purpose is small ; the pews and the screens, or rather partitions, are tasteless; there is no organ ; and the apparatus for ringing the bells, which is very conspicuous, puts one in mind of the ma chinery of a theatre. This portion consists of the choir, and part of the transepts; the nave, the aisles, and the re mainder of these being open, and free to the winds. So small a portion of a large edifice, occupied by but a thin and scanty congregation, would naturally be very cold ; and this is, of course, the reason why those partitions have been put up, which are such eye-sores in an architectural point of view. A structure of the cathedral form, with nave, choir, aisles, and transepts, how well soever it may accord with pomp and ceremony, is not adapted for a modern church, in which the assembled parishioners are to sit quietly and receive in struction in the doctrines and precepts of religion. We shall"], [139, "J VI A RIOJi II.... I.. .!,, II, r',1 ,.,/,,, I f\u201er ike /ro/trtctct J.J ' lloltlji,,.! LetUeqe Street , I'..

The worship of the cross, and the use of the cross as a sacred emblem, are abuses of Christianity, and were not admitted into its formulary until it had been debased by an unnatural union with the remain ing idolatry of the Heathens. Whatever may have been the origin of this form of a church, and how well soever it may have suited the gorgeous processions and solemn mummeries of monastic times, it is unquestionably far from the best adapted for a modern or Protestant church, in which an as sembled congregation are calmly and devoutly to approach their God in prayer and with praise, and sit to hear the still small voice of that true Gospel which is the Word of Life. Among the many lessons which the church of St. Cross is capable of affording to the observant visitor, the one now stated is far from being the least important ; and, while one regrets the mangling of its architectural symmetry by the wooden partitions, one cannot help feeling that, but for these partitions, it would be most uncomfortable in the win ter months. In consequence of these partitions, one is obliged to examine the nave and its aisles, the chancel, and the transepts, each in succession, and then put them to gether in imagination, for a general idea of this very fine and in some respects unique interior. The best actual view of it is from the south-west corner, as represented in the plate, though in any single view that can be taken many peculiarities of the architecture are necessarily left out.

In consequence of this, we only meet with little architecture which can posi tively be called Saxon, unless in crypts and other under ground buildings, or in some portion of a country church in a retired village. Even these latter are more frequently Norman ; and it is not unworthy of remark that in many of the country churches of Hampshire which have escaped the barbaric hands of modern improvement, there is generally a Norman doorway to the south, while the rest of the struc ture is of a modern architecture. It would far exceed our limits to enter into details of the various kinds of building which are to be met with at St. Cross ; and so we may mention generally that it is as useful as a study for architects, as it is delightful to ordinary vi sitors. Certain portions of the floor are paved with a peculiar kind of old tiles, which have some slight resemblance to tessellated pavement, and have on that account been called Roman. They are, however, of the middle ages, and are probably of Venetian manufacture, as that city was then the chief seat of European manufactures, as well as the em porium of European commerce. The tiles in question are of a square form, and small sized. Their principal sub stance is of a brick-red colour, which has been excavated to a small depth, to admit the white matter of which the de vices, inscriptions, and ornaments upon them are formed. Some of them bear English inscriptions in the church cha racter, which proves that they are not Roman ; but though the inscriptions on those at St. Cross are in the English language, it does not necessarily follow that the tiles are of English manufacture. Indeed, if the English had at that period been capable of making pottery of so durable a na* ture as these tiles, there certainly would have been remains of it in some of the buildings, and the expense of carrying stone for long distances over bad roads, would have been"], [143, "99 CITY OF WINCHESTER. dispensed with in those situations where excellent materials for bricks are found in the greatest abundance. The tiles in question are remarkable for their durability ; and they are among the only remains of some of the religious houses which were pulled down at an early period, \u2014 such as the priory of Selborne, in the eastern part of this county. As the character of St. Cross has all along been more of a charitable than a sacerdotal nature, few men of name have had their bones laid within its precinct, and its walls are not disfigured by inappropriate modern monuments to so un seemly an extent as those of many other \"sacred edifices. There is indeed one sepulchral niche in the wall of the north aisle, under the first window from the chancel, which, from the wall being taken down to admit of its erection, bespeaks a tenant of no ordinary grade. The canopy is a handsome cinquefoil arch, supported by short columns ; and under it there is an altar tomb, bearing, in modern charac ters, the words \"Petrusde Sancta Maria, ob : 1295.\" These are said to have replaced a similar inscription in the Saxon character, which time had corroded ; but the probability is that the character was the common old church letters, as the date is 159 years after the erection of the wall in which the niche is placed. Other than this, there is no account of the inhabitant of this tomb. The only, or at least the principal, mural monument is that of Wolfran Cornwall, who was Speaker of the House of Commons in 1780. It is of variegated marble and Gre cian architecture, which, with the Speaker's mace and its cushion, harmonise very badly with the solemn grandeur of a vaulted chapel, in the severest style of Norman architecture and consisting wholly of common stone. In various parts of the floor, there are flat monumen tal stones, level with the rest of the pavement, and therefore in proper keeping with the feeling which we have, that those whom they attempt to perpetuate are now mouldered into dust. The most remarkable of these is in the floor of the chancel. It contains a large brass with peculiar inscriptions, and he- m 2"], [144, "100 CITY OF WINCHESTER. raldic and other devices, ancl among the rest that passage from the book of Job, in which the Patriarch expresses his hope in the re-appearance of a Redeemer at the last day, and in the resurrection of the body after that shall have been consumed by the worms. This brass is of the latter part of the fourteenth century, and is the most remarkable one within the chapel, \u2014 some of those in the nave having been removed, but by what means is not known. There is some thing curious in this one, which might, in the days of superstition, have been regarded as a sort of miraculous afflatus. By some means or other, when the wind blows keenly, it gets below this brass ; and the brass accordingly is sonorous to the rising wind, \u2014 in the same manner, and pro bably from the same cause, as the ancient statue of Mem non is said to have been sonorous to the rising sun.

Connected with every city and town, there is always what may be called a home district of country, varying in its whole extent, and in its extent in different directions, accord ing to local circumstances, such as the nature and culture of the soil, and the proximity and size of other towns. The city or town and its home district of country have always a more intimate connexion, and a greater mutual influence upon each other than can subsist between either of them and any other place. This connexion between a town and its home district are always the greater, the less the town partakes in foreign trade or in manufactures ; and the ab sence of both has more influence in assimilating the town and its district, than those who have not reflected upon the subject would be apt to suppose. Winchester has its home district of country as well as other places ; and this district not only has a reciprocating influence with the city at the present time, but has partaken in all the fluctuations of which the city has been the sub ject. What may have been the character either of city or district previous to the Roman invasion, we have no certain means of knowing. In all probability both were rude enough, and the district, like most parts of the county, one general forest, abounding in deer and other wild animals."], [148, "102 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. While the land enjoyed the shelter of these aboriginal forests, it is probable that the cleared spots, in whatever manner they may have . been cultivated, were more fertile than the land is now ; and, according to the general law of wooded countries in northern latitudes, the seasons probably ran more into extremes, the climate was more humid, and the general temperature lower than it is at the present time. The Romans cut down some of the woods in order to reach the fortresses in which the natives took shelter; they cut down more for buildings, for fuel, and for other domestic purposes ; and there is little doubt that the Romanised Bri tons followed up the example that had been set them. Though this district is not particularly named, there can be little doubt that it supplied a portion of the grain which the Romans exported so largely from Britain ; and which was such as to lead one to conclude that this grain must have been raised upon virgin soil, recently cleared of timber. Trees are not now numerous in the home district of Win chester, neither does the climate appear to be very favourable to their growth. The few which are upon the elevated downs are stunted, and beaten by the winds, which sweep near the surface, with only a single tree, a thin row, or an ill-grown clump here and there, to break their fury. In the valley of the Itchen, again, there is a tell-tale lichen upon the bark, which indicates a damp, though certainly not one which is injurious to the human constitution. Lichens are mild though mysterious children of nature ; they are her elder born ; and while they collect the primary elements of organic matter from the air, and furnish soil for other plants, there does not appear to be one deleterious particle in the whole tribe. The appearance of lichens upon the trees shows that there is some element of vegetation floating in the air. This element is generally an excess of atmospheric moisture at some seasons of the year, and in certain states of the wea ther ; and this moisture requires a thicker and more porous surface soil to absorb it, and convert it more directly to the"], [149, "103 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. advantage of man and domestic animals. Winter is the season at which this element is most abundant and the lichens in most vigorous growth ; and therefore, broad belts of trees, and clumps of such magnitude and closeness as to arrest the current of the wind, and exclude the direct rays of the sun, are the primary means of amelioration. The ju dicious application of these would soon bring on new vege table action, and a new production and greater retention of vegetable mould, which would change both the winter damp and the summer drought from scourges to benefactors, and make that which, under present circumstances, works only for the evil of the district, work only for its good. These considerations very naturally suggest themselves to any one who examines the elevated chalky downs in the south of England, and compares the state of them during the extremes of winter or summer, with that of more porous soils in colder latitudes, and at greater elevations above the mean level of the sea. From their latitude, and the fact that the gales of the Atlantic, which upon the average fol low the tide-wave up the Channel and are the prevail ing winds, with little invasion or conflict of the cold north east, which \" burns frore,\" and causes blight in the east ern parts of England ; \u2014 from these circumstances, the win ter should be mild, and all the seasons kindly, even upon the most elevated chalk districts in the south. Such, how ever, is not the fact; for the winters are colder, and the snows fall deeper upon them than upon places of equal ele vation situated further to the north, and exposed to winds of far more unkindly nature than any which can come from the all-fertilising Atlantic, \u2014 the only ocean on the surface of our globe whose gales waft perennial verdure to every land which partakes of their bounty, and is in a condition to pro fit by it. Nature appears to have fitted such districts as that under consideration for deriving the full benefit of their local po sition ; for the primeval woods with which they were in great part covered retained that moisture which now flows"], [150, "104 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. off, or is evaporated as speedily as it falls. The porous and spongy gravel caps, such as we meet with between Alton and Alresford, and again toward the Southampton water, are the very antipodes of the chalky downs. They are even less kindly and fertile in the surface, because the rain which falls upon them sinks down into the earth, and carries the more richer part of the soil along with it. Thus, there remains nothing on the surface upon which the solar influence can act in any thing like an effective manner. Still these hungry gravels, and also sands, beds of which overlay the chalk in various places, are more easily clothed and sheltered by woods, especially woods of larch, than the chalk itself. Larch is, to a great extent, an atmospheric feeder, and thus if there is humidity in the atmosphere, it will thrive upon almost any soil where it can establish itself by striking its roots. Upon poor soils in exposed situations larches will grow feet while the common Scotch firs \u2014 even the bad wood, or abundantly-seeded variety, are growing inches ; and where the latter are literally good for no thing at the age of twenty or thirty years, the former are serviceable for most rustic purposes, except burning, which they stubbornly resist, so stubbornly indeed, that a beam of oak will be wholly reduced to charcoal and ashes before a similar one of larch is charred on the outside. On these thin gravelly soils, larches always thrive best when the sur face is removed or trenched down before they are planted ; and if it shall ever be attempted to shelter and improve these bleak downs with mould, perhaps pits formed in the chalk, and filled with small gravel, might be found useful, especially at the beginning. The gravel seems an indispensable adjunct of the chalk; and were it not for the loose beds which cap some of the principal heights, the chalk districts would be uninhabitable. The few springs and rivulets which are met with in districts of this character, usually break out between the gravel and the chalk, being fed by the rain which filters through the former ; and, were it not for those beds of gravel, there"], [151, "105 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. would be no Itchen in the Winchester district, either to ir rigate the meadows in the valley or to supply the city. In the map of the home district of Winchester, which we have given because it can be more readily consulted than a map of the whole county, we have taken a circle of seven miles radius, and circumscribed that in a square adjusted to the cardinal points. But as the southern part of this square overlays for at least three miles a similar square given in another map, of which Southampton is the centre, the de scriptive part of the present district will not reach more than about four miles down the Itchen from Winchester ; while in the north east it will be convenient to extend it to the remotest feeders of that river. The whole of this district may be looked upon as one vast historical monument, though a monument from which almost the whole of the ancient characters are obliterated, and the transcripts which have been recorded are not always to be depended upon. The numerous traces of encampments, the many lines of ancient roads, the smallness of the parishes, and various other circumstances, tend to show that this dis trict was far more populous in former times than it is now; and we have the joint authority of the chroniclers and other early writers, showing that all the named races of which the population of South Britain has been compounded have had a footing here. The memorials which have been left by these people, are, however, very different in importance; and if we subtract such as are Roman or Norman, the remainder is but small and not easily traced to its origin. There do not seem to be in this district, or indeed within the county, any monu ments which can be positively traced to the aboriginal Bri tons. What are called Druidical temples and altars, are so called upon doubtful authority. In Scotland there are none of these monuments in those parts of the country which were in exclusive possession of the Celts till a period compara tively recent, though there is no lack of materials upon the spot. But along the shores, which are known to have been VOL I. N"], [152, "106 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. very early visited by the Northmen, of Scandinavia, Jutland, or places farther to the south, they are not rare, and in some places they occur within less than a mile of each other. In such situations, there seems no doubt, that, as in Norway, these circles were dom-ringr, \"circles of doom or judgment,\" where questions proposed and argued by the chiefs were de cided by the men, in \" folkmote,\" as a jury, whose judgment was that of the majority, and final. But we enter not upon the controversy which this question involves, and which is really \"a bog without a bank.\" The conclusion at which we arrive is, that there are no monuments of the Celtic Britons. The same may be said of the Belg\u00e6, who are represented as being the inhabitants at the time of the Roman invasion, though the era at which the said Belg\u00e6 arrived is not ascer tainable in a satisfactory way. Gwent, the ancient name of the city, which really means \"wind,\" not \"white\" as is usually said, and may allude either to the \"winding\" of the river on which the city lies, to the sweeping of the wind over it both up and down the valley, or to both cir cumstances taken together, \u2014 this name, \" Gwent,\" may be Celtic, or Celtic a little Belgicised. Phin,Jin, vin as it is severally pronounced, is still a Celtic name for the wind, and the radical part of names for that over which the wind beats, or that which rides on the wind viewlessly as the wind it self \u2014 as for instance, the giants, the spirits of the mountains, and other personifications of the lingering remains of Celtic mythology. In composition, it forms part of the names of places which are situated at the bends or windings of rivers, and also much exposed to the atmospheric winds, \u2014 as for in stance, the castle of Phinhaven \u2014 Vinhaven \u2014 literally \"the wind on the river,\" or the winding of the river, is so situated near the summit-level of the great valley of Strathmore in Scotland, that whatever may be the state of the atmosphere in other places, there is always a breeze stirring there. The valley at Winchester is comparatively small, and the ground on which the city stands is much less exposed, but still if there is the least atmospheric motion, either up or down the"], [153, "107 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. valley, it is sure to tell as a breeze upon the more elevated part of Winchester. We mention this because the first part of the name of the city is almost the only Celtic monument remaining in the district; and also because the etymologists have, in general, mistaken the name, by supposing that Gwent, which is a cor ruption, means white. Gwynne is the modern Welch for white ; and Ban, Mhan, or Van, the root. Even at present, Winchester has no claims to be called the white city, the only parts where the chalk appears being a few pits and the embankments of the Railway ; and, as the downs were com pletely wooded in the olden time, and any clear spots must have been rich herbage, the green city would have been a much more appropriate name than the white one. The Roman Venta is a literal translation, and so is the Saxon Win. We need hardly add that ton is simply town, and Chester the Saxonised Latin for a castle ; so that Win ton is literally the town of the winds, and Winchester the castle of the winds ; though it does not appear that the Ro mans subjoined to Venta any word implying that there was either a castle or a fortified camp at Winchester during the period of their ascendancy in Britain, and this agrees with the known history of the place. Of the Belg\u00e6, who are said to have expelled the earlier Celts from this part of England, no vestige remains except the epithet Belgarum, which the Romans affixed to Venta ; and thus the first and second races of men who held pos sesion of this district may be said to be altogether monu mentless. With the Romans it is different ; for that people improved wherever they conquered, and the first of their improve ments were generally those which, even in the present state of the social arts, contribute most to the advancement of other improvements, \u2014 namely, good lines of communication between one place and another. Generally speaking those lines are along the heights, and the shortest distance rather than the most uniform level was chosen in the laying of them N 2"], [154, "108 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. down. But the first was probably matter of necessity, be cause the low grounds were then covered with tangled thick ets, quagmires, and marshes, and not only unwholsome but uninhabitable. The level was also a secondary considerar tion with the Romans, inasmuch as they employed beasts of burden and not carriages in transporting their appointments and stores from one place to another. The principal Roman roads which converged upon Win chester, or passed through it as a station, were the following: First, that from Clausentum, (now Bittern,) near the mouth of the Itchen, which is understood to have been their princi pal marine station for the valley ; secondly, the road from Nutshalling near the mouth of the Test, which after cross ing the high grounds, joined the former near Otterbourne ; thirdly, the road from old Sarum, which opened up a com munication with the west \u2014 Salisbury Plain being probably as luxuriant in its vegetation at that time as it is now bare in many places ; fourthly, the road from Portchester, stretch ing over the downs to the east, and communicating with what is understood to have been one of the chief maritime stations in these seas ; and fifthly, the road to Silchester \u2014 a very im portant station, as connecting the southern counties with the valley of the Kennet, and by that with the valley of the Thames. In many places, these roads have been obliterated ; but still portions of them have been traced from time to time, so as to leave no doubt that the five lines of communication which the Romans opened up between Winchester and other places, were skilfully planned according to the then state of the country, and were among the chief causes why the semi-barbarians who came after the Romans were so soon civilised, and also why they formed into larger nations, and possessed more national character, and more of the strength of union, than their brethren who remained at home in those parts of the continent from which they emanated. There is no doubt that, whether Saxons or Danes, those invaders brought a certain portion of energy with them ; but there is"], [155, "109 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. as little doubt that the turning of this energy to the general improvement of the national character was owing to what had been done by the Romans. Besides the roads that have already been mentioned, and numerous traces of forts said to be Roman, though many of them are on hill-tops and circular or oval, and, therefore, resemble the British camps in other parts of the county more than Roman ones, there have been many minor remains of Roman art found in the vicinity of Winchester, and along the lines of the roads alluded to. These have consisted of bricks, portions of tessellated pavement, urns, fragments of pottery, and other matters, with occasionally a small house hold statue. The ground near these roads has never indeed been turned over to any great extent without some memento of the Romans being met with. These are of course not embedded in the chalk, but merely covered by the accumu lation of rubbish. A few, though of no great importance have been found in digging for the Southampton Railway, and among others a little bronze Hercules, injured appa rently by fire. Of the Roman antiquities, unless such as are of a domes tic or funeral nature, and have been preserved in the soil near roads, stations, or the ruins of villas, the forts remain in the best preservation. They owe this principally to being situated on dry and barren summits of the downs where there is little temptation to disturb them by the plough. They are not so numerous in the Winchester district as further to the north, which would imply that the Romans held more peace able possession of this district, or that the Britons disputed less stubbornly with them, according as we attribute those hill camps or forts to the one people or to the other. In the district which we propose to consider, there are two principal ones, that on St. Catherine's hill already mentioned, and ano ther a little to the north of the Roman road from Sarum, and about five miles and a half west of Winchester. On the main heights of the county, which divides the country slop ing to the Kennet and other affluents of the Thames, these"], [156, "110 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. forts are much more numerous : but they are all upon ele vated spots, and have curved boundaries. The names are sometimes compounded of dun or don which means both a knoll and a hill camp, or more frequently of bury, that is, burg, or burgh \u2014 \"borough,\" which means a regular town, but is literally a stoppage, or situation where there is a defence to stop the further progress of an assailing enemy. Dun is more immediately Celtic, not unknown upon the continent ; and burg, or burgh may be regarded as more related to the Belgic, or at all events to a subsequent migration of the Celt\u00e6 from the opposite part of the continent. In Wales, and also in some parts of Scotland, caer, a camp or place of rendezvous, is the word made use of for the same description of encampment ; and any one who examines carefully the names of those ancient forts in the different districts of Bri tain, and notices where dun, or burgh, or caer, predominates, will be able to form at least some idea of the local distribu tion of the different races of the Celt\u00e6, in that very early pe riod of which there are no historical records worthy of be lief. It is not a little singular that some camps decidedly Roman, situate on the line where Agricola is understood to have fought successive battles with, and ultimately vanquish ed or least driven to the mountains, the ancient Caledonians, the diminutive for men is used, as the distinctive epithet, Caer buddo, that is, Caer bhodichan, \"the camp ofthe little men, or pigmies,\" being applied. This does not, we believe, occur anywhere in south Britain, neither does Caer form part of the name of any of the old forts in Hants. Saxon remains, especially those of the earlier period of their history, are comparatively few; and of the Danes there may be said to be none. Those of the later Saxons pass so gradually into the early Norman that it is not al ways easy to draw a line of distinction between them. They consist chiefly of the remains of edifices of the same descrip tion, namely, churches, or rather establishments for the se parate religious, and fortified castles, or dwellings of some kind for the nobles ; nor do we find, until times comparatively"], [157, "111 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. modern, any very marked traces of that improvement of the country and accommodation of the people generally, of which the example was set by the Romans, in what may be re garded as the first authentic age of British history, One Saxon relic, found a short time ago in digging through the rubbish a little to the westward of Winchester, is worthy of notice. This is the seal of Alfric, Earl of Mercia, a powerful man of his time, and equally remarkable for his treachery on some occasions, and the trust reposed in him upon others. He lived in the latter part of the tenth and beginning of the eleventh centuries; and the discovery of this seal shows that before the Norman conquest, and even before the reign of the Saxon Edward, who is under stood to have been the first to assimilate the manners of the Anglo-Saxons and the continental Normans, documents were authenticated by affixing to them the seals of laymen. It is but justice to state, that this Saxon relic, which is now in the British Museum, and the existence of which settles some facts, and unsettles some opinions among antiquaries, was rescued from neglect by Mr. Henry Barnes, of Winchester. This curious seal \u2014 of which we subjoin an engraving, is of a sort of brass \u2014 was considered an old half penny by the labourer who found it, and would have passed for a coin had it not been for the word \"sigil lum\" expressed upon it, along with the name of Alfric and the con traction for Earl or \u00c6ldeman. The rapid glance which we have now taken of the pro gressive history of the whole district of Winchester, is equal ly applicable to many other parts of the county of Hants, and indeed of the adjoining counties; and therefore the reader may, if he pleases, carry it along in his memory, as one portion of the description which we shall not need to repeat. Having stated this, we shall take a passing view of the present topography of this district of the county, mark-"], [158, "112 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. ing the prominent parts as graphically as our materials, our abilities, and our limits, will admit. In doing this, it will be desirable as far as possible to take the natural divisions of the district Of these there are three: First, the valley of the Itchen properly so called, including the slopes which lean decidedly toward that river ; secondly, the eastern downs on the left bank of the river ; and thirdly, the western and northern uplands, between the Itchen and the Test, and its eastern branch which rises near Stratton. THE ITCHEN AND ITS VALLEY. Though the Itchen contains a considerable quantity of beautifully transparent water, and is highly useful as well as ornamental to the district through which it flows, it is by no means a long river. In round numbers and without noticing the smaller flexures, which are partly natural and partly artificial, the total length may be estimated as follows: The middle branch, which is the principal one, rises about two miles to the eastward of Alresford pond ; and after a course of about two miles more it is joined by the southern branch which has a course of between four or five miles, by one branch from Kilmeston down, and by a shorter one from near Bramdean, and soon after by the northern branch which flows about five miles from near Preston Candover. The junc tion of these three branches forms the river, which receives little more accession of water from this point to the tide-way at Southampton. From this junction, the general course of the river is westward about five miles to King's Worthy, where it bends to the southward, and reaches Winchester after a course of about ten miles. Below Winchester the main course of the river is pretty straight, though generally toward the west or right bank of the valley, while the navi gable canal keeps on the left bank. Though of comparatively small dimensions, the Itchen is a river of considerable interest, not only on account of the beauty and fertility of its valley, the dense population which"], [159, "113 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. that valley must once have contained, the fertility of its meadows and sloping fields, and the number, beauty, and apparent comfort of its villages, but because it is a sort of index to the southern rivers of Hants and those of some other counties, and also to several important points in the Physical Geography of Hampshire. In order to understand this, we must bear in mind that the principal strata of the midland parts of the county are chalk, and red gravel of very loose texture. The gravel is chiefly found capping the upper downs, and the chalk in the lower slopes and the bottoms, except in so far as the latter consist of alluvial matters. The chalk immediately under the gravel frequently occurs in fragments, while on the lower grounds it lies more in solid beds. There are no springs or rivulets on the gravel caps, be cause these and the chalk immediately under them are porous and drink up the rain like sponges. The chalk, on the other hand, where it crops entirely to the surface, is in a great measure, impervious to the water ; and the small quantity which it does receive sinks by the vertical fissures to a consi derable depth, to which depth the inhabitants of the chalk downs must dig before they can obtain a supply of water for domestic purposes. Thus, both kinds of surface-soil are ill adapted for furnish ing a show or even a proper supply of water upon the sur face. But where they meet, the waters come out in copious springs, and of the purest quality ; and this is well exempli fied in the Itchen, which receives almost the whole of its sup ply of water in the first four or five miles from its source, and does not gain as much afterwards as it loses by evapora tion ; thus, like the Nile, it enters the sea a smaller river than it is in the upper country. The two kinds of soil to which we have alluded, though each of them taken singly, would form but a barren land, yet harmonize well together, \u2014 the chalk being a very appropri ate manure for the gravel, and the gravel a useful mixture for the chalk. Hence we find that the best lands in the vol. i. o"], [160, "114 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. county, \u2014 and they are equal to any in England for the qua lity if not for the absolute weight of their crops \u2014 are those which are intermediate between the gravel and the chalk and consist of a mixture of two. It is also in them that the springs come out, and all the elements of life and beauty are found in the greatest abundance. In consequence of this, the valley of the Itchen is the re verse of many and indeed of most valleys, for the upper part of it is the most rich and productive, and it gradually becomes worse and worse as it approaches the sea. The chief cause of this is, that the chalk wholly disappears in the vicinity of Southampton ; and though the gravelly soil can be rendered both productive and early by artificial culture, it is natu rally barren, and kept in a state of cultivation at great expense. The fact is, that the portion of soil which ought to fertilize this southern part of the valley, lies in the South ampton Water, where it is a nuisance both by interrupting the navigation and by tainting the atmosphere, \u2014 and if good and effective means could be devised for transferring this mud to its proper place, it would be one of the greatest local im provements. The current of the Itchen is nowhere violently rapid, and yet there is scarcely any spot at which it does not dance and sparkle onward with that peculiar ripple which gives such freshness to river scenery. In consequence of this, and of the quantity of water which it contains in the whole of its course, sufficient power is obtained for an ordinary mill at almost any part of it, with little expence of embankment. Mills are accordingly very numerous, and most of them are in picturesque situations and contribute not a little to the beauty of this delightful valley. The dry character of the adjoining hills and downs contri bute to the same effect, by bringing the great mass of the population near to the banks of the river. Hence, there are more villages and a closer succession of parish churches in the valley of the Itchen above Winchester than are to be met with in almost any other part of England. These would"], [161, "115 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. lead one to suppose that, in former times, when Winchester was the capital of England, this part of the vicinity was more populous than it is at the present time ; but even now, that population which a stranger misses, even in the highly cul tivated parts of the uplands, is found in the valley, in villages which are almost unrivalled in their beauty and the appa rent comfort and decorous behaviour of their inhabitants. We leave the economist to decide whether this distance of the labourer from the field which he cultivates, is or is not a pecuniary loss ; but of this we are certain, that bringing the people together in these rural villages tends greatly to promote all the enjoyments, the kindly feelings, and the cha rities of social life, \u2014 and we may add, rational information and temperate opinions upon all subjects whether public or private. If any philanthropist should desire to have occu lar demonstration of how good it is for men and families not to be al ones let him visit the valley of the Itchen, \u2014 and espe cially let him visit it on a summer Sunday, when no sound will meet his ear, save the songs of innumerable birds, and the voices of many congregrations worshiping their Maker in their own parish churches. If he loves those things, let him come hither and be delighted: if he loves them not, let him come hither and learn. We may further remark of this river, and it will apply to most of the other south-running rivers of the county, that, according as the bottom of the valley is sloping or on a level, the vegetation and accumulated soil of the meadows vary. Wherever there is a regular slope, the grass is kindly, there are no marsh plants, and no deposite of peat is formed under the surface ; but wherever the bottom lies for some distance on a level, so as to occasion a natural stagnation of water upon the surface, the grasses are coarse, marsh plants appear, and peat is formed in such quantities as to be in some places cut for fuel. This shows the advantage of a sloping surface in meadows which are fertilized by irriga tion; and it shows something more, namely, that the atmos phere of this part of England is dry and kindly, and by no o2"], [162, "116 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER means favourable to the growth of moss, inasmuch as the bog-mosses do not appear on the surface, even when there is a stratum of peat below, neither does the peat mingle with the water so as in the least to colour it, or to render it unfit for the most delicate purposes to which water can be applied. It is not a little remarkable, however, that those changes of soil in the valley tell upon the trout ; and yet such is the case ; for wherever the meadows are of kindly grass, the trout are yellow and beautifully spotted with crimson, while on the peaty grounds they are darker in colour and very inferior in flavour. The Itchen, throughout its whole course is cele brated for its trout ; and for this reason, those who are fond of etymologies might perhaps trace its name to a Celtic word, signifying the \"Fish River.\" It will now be necessary to take a rapid glance at the different subjects worthy of notice which are situated on the upper part of this river or its branches ; and for this purpose we shall begin with the middle branch, which is the principal one, and which also rises nearest the sources of those rivers and streams which flow towards the Thames. For about five miles along the gravel-capped heights to the south-west of Alton, there is no river or even rivulet but during the rains ; and we meet with the first and small branch of the Itchen at Bishop's Stoke, where there is a neat village and parish with a valued rent of 4700/. and a population of upwards of 1000. Water-meadows begin near this place ; and there are some artificial dammings of the brook before it reaches the great pond at Alresford. Ano ther branch rises to the north of this, in the small parish of Bighton containing only about 300 inhabitants, and this branch as well as the former runs into the Alresford pond. The pond is interesting, from being a sheet of about 200 acres in surface where water is otherwise very scanty. It is artificial, having been formed by a substantial embankment constructed by Godfrey de Lucy bishop of Winchester, about the close of the twelfth century. The bishop appears to have had two objects in view \u2014 the beautifying of the coun-"], [163, ""], [164, "Wtncliester. Published fbrthe. Proprietor. Jas Robbins .College Street. Printed it/ JiusseH By D.E.&ilrnour.tublu: library .Siyh Street"], [165, "117 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. try, and the obtaining of a summer supply of water for the navigation of the river, which, as a source of profit, he extended as far as this point. Alresford, or New Alresford, is a neat country town, situated on the London road, and immediately to the south west of the pond. It consists of one long and crooked street, along which the road passes, with a wide space at right angles to this and extending toward the pond. The land in the neighbourhood is fertile, and Alresford is in consequence a place of considerable local trade. It is a market town ; and both the weekly markets and the fairs are well attended. The population is about 1500. It is usually said that this town and parish were bestowed upon the church of Winches ter by Kenewalk the Saxon, in gratitude for his conversion to Christianity by Birinus. But it is not improbable that this, like many other gifts to the church in the olden time, was obtained by an appeal to the fears rather than to the gratitude of the monarch. Be this as it may, Alresford was long the property of the see of Winchester, and it was greatly improved by De Lucy, or rather the present town was found ed by him, as being on a more convenient spot than Old Alresford, which was not so easily accessible, especially when the river was flooded. It is sometimes said that the embankment which confines the Alresford pond is part of a Roman road ; but this is not probable, inasmuch as the name implies that there was water to he forded there in the time ofthe Saxons. Old Alresford lies about three quarters of a mile to the north ; and the parish contains only about 460 inhabitants. Between the pond and the straggling village of Old Alresford are situated the park and mansion of Lord Rodney. The park though not very extensive, is well laid out, the mansion is handsome, and seen across the pond from the London road, it has a pleasing appearance. The pond is, indeed, very ornamental to the town and to all the adjoining country ; and the eye of the traveller is quite refreshed by perceiving this expanse of water, after the arid and streamless character"], [166, "118 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. of the whole country from Alton to where the pond becomes visible. Below Old Alresford there are water-meadows along the small brook which flows southward from that village ; and those meadows continue till the junction of the branches which form the main stream of the Itchen, which, as soon as they have joined, makes a considerable flexure to the south. The southern branch of the river rises below the downs near Kilmeston, which is a little parish containing a village and about 250 inhabitants. Cheriton parish contains a pretty large village and about 700 people. On the afternoon of Sunday, June 30, 1833, four little boys playing in a field called the Old Litten, at Beauworth, in Cheriton parish, discovered in the rut of a waggon-wheel a leaden box containing a number of coins of William, sup posed by antiquaries to be partly of the Conqueror and partly of his son Rufus. The passing of the waggon had broken the box ; and the boys observing a piece of the lead, discovered the coins in attempting to pull it out of the ground. The children did not know the value of what they had dis covered ; but the villagers did, and soon ransacked the box. Mr. Dunn of Alresford, the owner of the land, claimed the tresor trouve and got more than 6000 of the pieces ; but not quite the whole. The owner of the land sold the coins ; and distributed the price in part among the finders, and in part in charity. The leaden box was thirteen inches long, eleven deep, and nine wide; but besides having been injured by the waggon-wheel, it was pulled to pieces by the rustics in their scramble for the contents. An account of the mat ter was sent to the Antiquarian Society by Edward Hawkins, Esq., and published in the 26th volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia. These coins were in excellent preservation, and appeared never to have been circulated, but by whom or for what purpose they were deposited cannot be known. They pro bably formed part of the royal treasure, as they all belong to one or at least to two reigns, and are quite recent. Among them there are coins struck in more than sixty different places; and there are a considerable number which have"], [167, "119 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. been struck by Winchester moneyers. They were all sil ver pennies, each weighing very nearly one pennyweight Troy ; and from the state in which they were found the letters can in general be easily made out, \u2014 only, by some blunder or other, the Anglo-Saxon W or V, has been ren dered by P in the Arch\u0153ologia. As there is some resem blance in the letters, and also some affinity in sound between V and P, this mode of printing may do well enough for anti quaries ; but it is apt to mislead common readers, when such take an interest in these matters. Beauworth, where these coins were found, is a separate tithing attached to the parish of Cheriton, valued at about 750/. rental, and containing 150 people. The village lies nearly 6 miles ESE. of Winchester, 2 south of Cheriton, and 1 west of Kilmeston. Hinton Ampner lies about a mile north of Kilmeston, and a mile and a half south-east of Cheriton ; the population of the parish is about 400, and the valued rental about 2400/. Bramdean is the next parish on the east, and contains a population of about 200. These may be considered as the most remote parishes on the southern branch of the Itchen ; but as there are no running waters on the upper downs, the lines of summit-level cannot easily be traced. Vegetation is not, however, so much parched as one might suppose ; for, owing to the surface being more of a reflective than an absorbent nature, there is a copious formation of dews after warm days. Farther down is the parish of Titchborne, which has acquired some historical celebrity from having long been the seat of the family of Titchborne or De Titchborne, one of the oldest in the county. In former times they took an active part in public affairs, were frequently Sheriffs of Hants, and Sir Richard Titchborne, from his zeal in antici pating instruction from head-quarters for proclaiming James I. on the death of Elizabeth, received warm commendations from that sapient monarch. The downs on this side of the Itchen are very dry, or at"], [168, "120 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER all events destitute of springs or streams ; and therefore the inhabitants are mostly found in the valleys, collected in villages as already stated. This branch of the river is called simply the Titchborne water ; and the etymologists have supposed that the first part of the name is formed of De Itchen. This is not very pro bable, because the branch is the smallest of the three which form the Itchen, because rivulets here are usually named after the places which they pass, and because borne is a current name for smaller running streams, wherever the Anglo-Saxon language has been in part preserved, either in the northern division of Britain or the southern. We may farther remark that a word very similar in sound, if allowance be made for the well-known interchange of b and p, is used in the Celtic language to express a similar meaning. The northern branch of the Itchen contains more water than this one, and the land on its banks is less exclusively chalk, and of superior quality. Some of the best corn land in the centre of Hampshire lies on the banks of this rivulet, and on the right bank of the Itchen where this rivulet joins. This branch rises below Farleigh downs, about midway between Alresford and Basingstoke ; it passes by. a number of villages, is used in irrigating meadows, and sometimes embanked up into ponds or small lakes. Near the source is situated Preston Candover, a parish and pretty large vil lage, though the parish is not upon the whole populous. Below this there are in succession the parishes of Chilton Candover containing only 130 inhabitants, and Brown Candover containing only 300. Still farther down there is the parish of Northington, which has also nearly 300 inha bitants, and below, that of Swarraton, which contains only 120. Thus, there are, within about four miles and a half along this rivulet, no fewer than five parishes, the whole population of which does not exceed 1300. The principal park and mansion on this branch of the Itchen are those of the Grange, the residence of Lord Ash burton, better known to the public as Mr. Alexander Baring,"], [169, "/ SEAT OF LORD ASHBURTON.)

The park is exten sive, and the house is built after the plan of Inigo Jones. We now come to the valley of the Itchen as formed of the combined waters of the three branches above enumerated, together with some smaller rills which come trickling in as long as the gravel caps on the high roads continue. This is the characteristic portion of the valley to which we have already alluded in general terms, and thus we shall not now require to do more than give a list of its most striking parti culars. We shall render this list more perspicuous by taking first the right bank and then the left. The first parish below the junction is the conjoined one of Itchen Stoke and Abbotson which has a population of about 260. It passes into downs on the upper part; but the lower parts have a fine appearance, and are very fertile and highly cultivated. The next parish is Itchen Abbots which contains a very beautiful village, but its beauty has been injured by the removal of the church from its old situar tion near the river, to an exposed one by the road side. Farther down, there are, in succession, the small parishes of Martyr Worthy, Abbots Worthy, Kings Worthy, and Head bourn Worthy, at each of which there is a pleasant village ; and the grounds, especially those near the river, are very beautiful. Here again, we find six parish churches within a distance of about five miles ; and these, with the five for merly mentioned, give a plenitude of such edifices almost unknown in any other rural district of England. Headbourn Worthy, which lies at the bend of the river, brings us to the parish of Hyde, and thus completes this bank of the Itchen above Winchester. Worthy Park, the beautiful residence of S. Wall, Esq. is situated northward of the Worthys, on the Basingstoke road ; and at King's Worthy is the unique Elizabethan mansion of the Rev. C. Baring. On the left bank of the Itchen there are three parish churches and villages, between the junction of the branches and the parish of Winnall already noticed. The uppermost of these is Ovington, near the most southerly bend of the VOL I, P"], [172, "122 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. river. The situation of the village is pleasant, on a sloping bank ; but some parts of the bottom immediately adjoining are cold. The number of inhabitants is about 180, chiefly resident in the village ; the parish is wholly agricultural, and the rent bears a high proportion to the population. A little to the westward of Ovington there is the small village of Lovington, at a little distance below which is Avington, a small village situated within the grounds of the same name belonging to the Duke of Buckingham, whose mansion Avington House is near the bank of the river. Adjoining the mansion there are several fine old trees; and the sloping grounds above are very tastefully and judiciously ornamented and sheltered by belts and clumps of planting, which occupy a considerable breadth of surface, and extend to the Alresford and Winchester road, which is here about two miles distant from the river. The superior appearance of the crops upon these sheltered fields over those on such of the adjoining heights as are left open to the wind, shows how judicious the duke has been in thus ornamenting the country, and increasing the value of the estate both to him self and to his farmers, and how wise it would be in others to follow his example. Many of the young trees are of the conifer\u00e6, especially larches, which are at once the most cer tain growers, the most valuable timber, and the greatest im provers of the soil ; not only of the cone-bearing family, but of all forest trees whatever. There are many hundreds of acres in Scotland, where larches have converted black heath into green pasture in the course of a few years ; and they have not the same tendency to bring moss and ultimately peat upon the surface of the ground, as Scotch firs and other species of the Pinus genus, which do not shed their leaves or spines in the autumn. This is a circumstance well worthy of attention by prac tical arboriculturists, especially those who wish to call in the aid of timber as an auxiliary against the bleakness of the winds in situations like the downs under notice. We need hardly mention that, whether in Britain or in Ireland,"], [173, "123 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. the ancient forests which have fallen through the decay of nature, and are buried in the earth, are invariably found in peakbogs, when they consist of pines \u2014 the most common trees in those accumulations. It must not be supposed that this peat or decayed moss results wholly from the death and fall of the trees, and the stagnation of humidity among their fallen trunks ; for, though these circumstances give rigour to the accumulation, which it never could acquire if the trees remained standing, yet it is begun while the trees are in growth, and this beginning arises partly from the continu ance of the spines during the winter, and partly from their firm texture and tendency to resist natural decomposition. It must be borne in mind that, though Scotch firs and other pines are green during the winter, they do not grow at that time of the year. Their period of growth is in the early summer ; it is rapid while it lasts, if the soil is favourable ; and it stops eariier than the growth of many deciduous trees which make no second shoot. The green leaves upon the fir in winter are in reality dead leaves, that is, all vegetable action in them has ceased, and thus they do not resist changes of temperature, as is done by living vegetables as far as their powers of endurance go, but change with its changes, much in the same way as if they were mineral substances. This tends still farther to harden their naturally firm con sistency ; and it also makes them accumulate a continual dripping of water during the rains ; and, as their thick shade excludes the light and the free circulation of the air, the ground below them is placed under those circumstances which are most favourable to the growth of the mosses \u2014 the spores, or minute seeds of which are to be found everywhere, nearly indestructible from their very smallness, and therefore ready to cover the surface with their myriads, whenever the state of things is favourable to them. When they have once formed a sod, they continue growing at top and decaying at bottom, and thus gradually choke and cover the heaths and other under shrubs, ancl ultimately invade the pines them selves and hasten their downfal. p 2"], [174, "124 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. The hardness of the pine leaves, and the turpentine which these contain, make them proof against that ordinary decom position which reduces the fallen leaves of autumn to soil favourable for the vegetation of the coming year. But when any subject in nature ceases to be useful, means for its decomposition are always provided; and the leaves of pines are no exception to this. The mosses and the water which these accumulate and retain, gradually consume the buried trunk, the resinous matter retreating toward the root as the disorganisation proceeds. In some of our native peat bogs, the fragments of pine roots which are left are so saturated with resin that they burn with the brilliancy of torches; and it is highly probable that the final stage of this decomposition, after all the ligneous fibres are decom posed, is amber. Those pines and their acccompaniments, form an interesting chapter in the local and progressive physiology of the globe; but one upon which for obvious reasons we cannot enter. The spines of the larch not being suited to bear the win ter, are of tender consistency, and easily reduced to a kindly soil. The naked sprays of their branches do not occasion the same dripping during the winter as the close foliage of pines, and as the winter is the grand season for the growth of the mosses, these have not the same encouragement. Thus, as there is not the same necessity for the action of mosses under larch trees that there is under firs, there are not the same means for their production. In this we see a striking in stance of that dependency which all the parts and produc tions of nature have upon each other ; and we may also learn how very efficient larches judiciously planted may be made in improving the soil upon places which are bleak and bare, and where the climate is naturally such as to second the efforts of the cultivator. Besides the lesson and the example afforded by its well adapted and thriving woods, the mansion of Avington has some name in history. Like many manors in the neigh bourhood, this one once belonged to the church, having been"], [175, "125 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. given to the monks of St. Swithun by King Edgar. From the days of Elizabeth it became the property of the family of Brydges, afterwards Dukes of Chandos, and passed by marriage into the hands of the Buckingham family. During the time that Charles II. was engaged about his projected palace in Winchester, Avington House was one of his harems ; Nell Gwynne and her sister beauties being frequently there, under the roof of the notorious Countess of Shrewsbury as mistress of the ceremonies. The present thriving condition and orderly quietude of the place, form a pleasing contrast with the unseemly revels of that maddening and mischievous period of our annals. Between Avington and Winnall, the only remaining parish on the left bank of the Itchen is that of Easton which con tains a very pleasant village and nearly 500 inhabitants, though its surface is not so extensive as that of some of the adjoining parishes. In the western part of the parish of Easton, and onward through Winnall, St. John's, Chilcombe, and so on to Twy ford, the slope on this bank of the Itchen is less wooded, more chalky and bare in its surface, and more exclusively under turf than the slopes farther up the valley. In its pre sent state of comparative nakedness, it is cold; but still it is cultivated in various places, and though the crops are light they are of good quality. Near Twyford, the downs on this bank of the river become lower, a few rivulets and occasional ponds make their appearance, there is more wood, and the character of the country is more diversified. Below Winchester, the valley of the Itchen is less regular than above ; and though the strata in no part of it bear any marks of having been disturbed by volcanic or other action of the earth itself, yet there are traces of aqueous distur bance as we approach the line where the chalk blends and is lost in the gravel sand and clay of the lower part of the valley. It is impossible to decide so clearly on the forma tion of the reaches of a river valley in such strata as it is in the case of rocks, the disrupted edges of which show where"], [176, "126 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. barriers have been broken down and lakes emptied. Proba bly, however, there may once have been a lake above Win chester, and others in the reaches or basins of the valley below the city. St. Giles' hill on the left, and the high downs behind the site of the castle on the right, narrow the valley just at the city. Below this, we have the basin of St. Cross, on the right, extending toward \" Oliver's Battery,\" about a mile and a half south-west of the castle, and closing in toward the bank of the river opposite the village of Twyford. On the left, there is a vale or amphitheatre, opening between St. Giles' and St. Catherine's hills, extending eastward about two miles toward Easton downs, consisting chiefly of the parish of Chilcombe, and in great part under tillage, but ill-supplied with water. This parish contains about 200 inhabitants. The Vill of Milland, which is extra*-parochial, lies partly in this amphitheatre and partly in the meadows by the Itchen. The parish of Twyford lies to the south of Chilcombe. The village is pleasant, aud the population greater than that of most of the rural parishes near Winchester, being about 1200. There is a picturesque old church at the village ; and at Shawford, a mansion house which belongs to the Mild may family, is pleasantly situated near the river, and em bosomed in woods. Twyford has a sort of classical celebrity from the fact of Pope having received part of his education at a Catholic school in the village. The church contains the monument of Bishop Shipley of St. Asaph, whose son (we believe) Dean of the same place, acquired considerable noto riety in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Beyond Twyford down, the left bank of the' river, is less elevated, but more varied, and gravel, sand, and clay, mingle with and in some instances replace the chalk. Some ponds and rivulets in consequence appear; but there is no nameable brook of running water. The right bank is of different character ; the downs ap proach the river, in a series of ridges, the first and second of which are almost wholly chalk, often very bleak and destitute"], [177, "II.IMI'XIII 1:1 ' i\u201e ,1, I;,.,.,,,/.., ,\u201e' i;\u201ei,i\u201e\u201e. fail,,, Si,,, I"], [178, ""], [179, "SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. 127 of water. The parish church and straggling village of Comp ton lie in a sheltered dell between these ridges, but there is no stream of water in the dell. This parish is hilly ; and, it contains a population of about 255. On the ridge between Compton and Otterbourne, the chalk begins to be mixed with sand and clay ; and on the southern slope, toward the latter village, the chalky appearance both of the fields and the highways ceases ; the soil becomes stronger in the bottoms and better adapted for timber in the heights, and a small perennial stream of water flows along the dell to the Itchen. Otterbourne is named from this rivu let ; but whether it ever abounded with otters it is not easy to say, though there is little scope for these animals at pre sent. The old parish church was near the Itchen ; but a new one of rather tasteful appearance has been erected on the slope south of the \"bourne,\" and near to the side of the Southampton road, along which the habitations of the vil lagers are spotted. The parish contains altogether about 600 inhabitants. The Roman roads, from Bitterne their port on the Itchen, and Nutshalling the situation of their port on the Test, met near Otterbourne, and proceeded jointly to Winchester. As these were roads of great traffic, various memorials of the Romans are, from time to time, found near their lines ; and there are many traces of ancient encamp ments on the elevated parts of the adjoining downs ; but as there were contests successively with the Romans, the Sax ons, and the Danes, in this neighbourhood \u2014 Winchester being an object of cupidity to each of the invading races, it is not easy to say with perfect certainty to whom these en campments belonged. Besides, as this is about the point on the Itchen, at which the character of the soil changes, and a few rivulets begin to make their appearance, it will be more natural to notice the lower valley of the river as part of the home district of Southampton, \u2014 inasmuch as both the ancient and the modern history of this district of the coun try, are referable to that port rather than to the inland city of Winchester."], [180, "128 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. THE EASTERN DOWNS. Our notice of these may be confined to a few words, inas much as they do not contain any subject of modern interest, and the remains of antiquity upon them are so faded, that they may be said to have become only their own monuments, and have hardly any tale to tell respecting the people by whom, and the purposes for which, they were originally constructed. The position of the Roman road connecting Winchester with the great Roman harbour of Porchester may still be traced upon these downs, as well as on various other parts of the line ; and, like the other Roman ways, it proceeded very much on the straight line, regardless of the inequalities of hill and dale. It is true that, on the chalky downs, those inequalities are not so great as to be serious impediments to the progress of men and domestic animals ; but still they diversify the surface ; and as, even where there are no rivulets, there is a sort of atmospherical reciprocation between the height and the hollow, the bottoms and valleys of those streamless downs are by no means destitute either of beauty or of fertility. The principal parishes and villages upon these downs are : Morestead about a mile and a half south of Chilcombe, Owslebury about the same distance south of Morestead, and Upham about two miles and a half south-east of Owslebury and about midway between that and Bishop's Waltham near the source of the river Hamble. Morestead is a small parish, chiefly on the downs, with a limited rental and not 100 inhabitants. Owslebury is much more valuable and populous, being rated at nearly five times the rental, and containing about 670 inhabitants. Upham though not so valuable in rent or so populous as Owslebury, is still a parish of considerable importance, the population being up wards of 500. The three parishes now mentioned, skirt the southern side of what may be considered as peculiarly the dry and chalky part of the down. The one first mentioned is most decidedly"], [181, "SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. 129 upon the chalk, and therefore the surface of it is more naked than that of the other. Owslebury and Upham approach nearer to the gravelly and clayey soil, and from near Upham one rivulet flows westward and joins the Itchen above Stoke, and another flows south-eastward and joins the Hamble about a mile below Bishop's Waltham. Seats are not very numerous in this district, especially in the elevated part of it. One of the principal is Longwood, belonging to the Earl of Northesk. The most bleak, the most elevated, and the least culti vated portion of those downs, is that which lies upon the line from Winchester to Warnford. This line passes from St. Giles' hill, over Magdalen hill, Easton down, Longwood warren, Gander down, Kilmeston down, and Beacon hill ; and making allowance for its flexures, may be regarded as the water-shed which divides the rain of heaven into opposite portions, and turns the rills and rivulets in opposite direc tions, at times and in places when there are any to be turned. THE WESTERN DOWNS. Taken in its length, the down or height upon the right bank of the Itchen is much more extensive than that on the left ; and it is also more easily defined, though the breadth from the river to the water-shed is less. From near the Grange, already alluded to, it may be traced northward about twelve miles to the northern sum mit-level, which parts the upper valleys of the Test and its branches from that portion of the county which inclines toward the vale of the Kennet, and from the source of the Loddon near Basingstoke. From the same point it may be traced westward, between the Itchen and the valley of the most southerly branch of the Test, and then southward, at no great distance from the Itchen, until one arrives at the lines of heights which come close to the bank of that river at Compton and Otterbourne. The termination of the northern division here, with regard both to the slope of VOL. I. Q"], [182, "130 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. the surface and the character of the soil, being the wooded hill to the south of Otterbourne, which extends by Cran bury Park in the direction of Hursley. The surface of the elevated grounds on this side of the Itchen is much diversfied ; and the line of water-shed parting the valleys of the Itchen and the Test is very irre gular, sometimes approaching nearest to the one river, and sometimes to the other ; but in general, it may be said to be nearer the Itchen, which one would expect from the Test being the longer river. It is not easy to average the breadth of the portion which belongs to the valley of the Itchen, though, two miles is not very far from it \u2014 the dis tance from King's Worthy on the Itchen to Stoke Charity on the branch of the Test, being about four miles, and the length of slope nearly equal both ways. The greatest extent, and also upon the whole the highest ground, is on the line north-westward from Winchester, in the direction of Chilbolton, near which the southern and main branches of the Test join ; and, as is the case on the other side of the Itchen, this north-west part of these downs, is the most bleak, dry, and destitute of timber. Even the most elevated parts are, however, covered with grass, and not with heath as is the case even upon lower grounds when the subsoil consists of a depth of sand. The swells and depressions of many parts of these downs are exceedingly beautiful, and remarkably well adapted for ornamental planting. The slopes are often steep, and the hills near to each other ; but the sections are always curves, and generally very graceful ones ; so that the ground is a basis for beauty, but not for sublimity. Yew-trees are particularly abundant, in hedge-rows, in copses, in clumps, and in single plants standing apart ; and as this county was, in the olden time, celebrated for its bow men, it is probable that these yews are remnants of the forests from which their bows were supplied. What they may have been in the days of archery, it is not easy to say ; but at present there are not very many yews in this district,"], [183, "131 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. except in situations peculiarly rich and sheltered, from which a long bow fit for \"an archer strong,\" could be made. In genera], the trunks are very short, gnarly, and clustered, or actually parted into fragments down to the surface of the ground. The topmost branches of the spreading heads sel dom rise higher than twenty or thirty feet ; and very often, upon the exposed slopes, the single trees are branched to the ground, and altogether not larger than sheep. Yet these little dwarfs have the same appearance, both of age and of endurance, as the tallest of the species ; and there is some thing to be learned, as well of the past history as of the pre sent management of the district, in the varied growth of these dusky children of the forest. If the yew is in a sheltered situation, the twigs of it grow long enough to send a bird bolt after a sparrow, if not to launch a broad arrow which could cleave the plaited mail of a \" baron bold ;\" but when the trees stand friendless in the blast they are pigmies. Thus, they show us how the productiveness of this part of Eng land has been gradually deteriorated by denuding the surface of its woods ; and they call on the present proprietor, in lan guage more eloquent and more incessantly repeated than that of man, to do his duty by his country, and at the same time enrich himself and his successors, by opposing a plan tation of sheltering timber to every gale which now sweeps the land with the \"besom of destruction.\" We believe that there are in many parts of the district under notice, obstacles to this kind of improvement, arising from the nature of the holdings. Much of the surface is copyhold, or leasehold renewable upon fines ; and as lands of this description are in general frittered down into small fragments so that there can be no harmony of general im provement, and the holders have quite enough to do to maintain themselves, the tenures of the land may be said to be leagued with the blasts of the atmosphere, in continuing the comparative nakedness and sterility of much of the sur face. These are points, however, the full investigation of Avhich would far exceed our limits ; but they are well worthy q 2"], [184, "132 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. of attention, and we may have occasion to revert to some of the peculiarities of tenure. The yew-trees to which we have alluded, are a sort of book of record upon this subject, and they are a remarkably durable one. It has often been said that yews, which are found more frequently, and of larger size, in church-yards than in almost any other places, are emblems of mortality ; but there is no greater mistake either as to the nature of the trees, or their emblematical character in places of sepul ture, if any such character was intended by planting them there. Of all forest trees, and especially of all coniferous ones, not excepting the junipers, and among them the arbor vit\u0153, whether oriental or occidental, the yew is by way of eminence \" the tree of life.\" It is difficult to say that there is a single point in the whole living surface of a yew-tree which is not capable of producing a bud, and which will not actually produce buds and stems and branches, and struggle against time in a manner which is equally impres sive and instructive. When a tree of any other description becomes hollow, all vegetable action within the hollow ceases ; for, though the external part may stand for many years, and it may redouble its productiveness of flowers and seeds, yet the internal wound never heals ; and the an nual decay is always greater than the annual production of new wood, so that the tree must at last yield to the power of destruction. A yew, on the other hand, will turn round its bark upon the rifted fragments of its bole, send up new stems within its hollow, and otherwise contend for prolonged existence, so as to exhibit the most pleasurable and at the same time the most picturesque results. In consequence of this, the old yews upon the slopes under notice are delightful studies, to the lover of nature, to the improver of the land, and to the moralist. They do not indeed, \" teach the rural moralist to the ;\" but there is a strong analogy between the struggling of a"], [185, "133 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. yew with the casualties of time, and the struggling of a man with the chance-medley of the world ; and farther, there is a breathing of immortality about those trees which are life all over and will not die. This is the true reason why yews have been planted in church-yards, and why their situation there is so appropriate. Men do not lay the bones of their fathers and their friends in consecrated ground, because they are dead; for if this were the reason, much more should they give their favourite domestic animals the same kind of sepulture, because these are much more dead than human kindred \u2014 utterly and finally dead \u2014 blended with the common mass of matter never thence to return. Men consecrate the ground, weep o'er the grave, and set up the monument, not in sorrow for death, but in evidence of the glorious hope of resurrection. It is for the same reason that the yew-tree is planted in the church-yard \u2014 where that all-vital and evergreen monitor stands as a perpetual homily, and as a most convincing emblematical proof of the most delightful truth which the Almighty ever revealed to his rational offspring. But we must leave the reader to follow out these moralis ings as he lists \u2014 they are delightful moralisings on a coun try walk, especially one of which health or pleasure is the object, \u2014 we must leave them and proceed to our humbler but more appropriate task of topographical outline. The point at which to begin is Stratton Park, the north ern extremity of which is about nine miles north-east of Winchester on the road to Basingstoke, and therefore beyond the distance to which we have limited the home district of that city. It is however within this district for social pur poses ; and it lies so exactly between the sources of the northern branch of the Itchen, and the southern branch of the Test, that it may with equal propriety be referred to the valley of either. This park and mansion at present (1838) belong to Sir Thomas Baring. We have already mentioned that the original mansion was constructed out of the materials"], [186, "134 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. of Hyde Abbey, when that was dissolved by Henry VIII, and many of its estates, especially the manors of Stratton and Mitcheldever, given to the Earl of Southampton. From that family it passed to the Russells of Bedford, by whom the mansion was in part taken down ; and from them it passed to the present owner, by whom the park and lands are kept in excellent order. The village and parish church of East Stratton lie partly within the park, and partly to the south-east of it. The parish contains nearly 400 in habitants. From this point the summit-level lies across the wood of Mitcheldever, and crosses the Basingstoke road about five miles from Winchester. Westward, along the heights here, there is nothing very remarkable except barrows, and other traces of ancient battle and death, until we come to the parish church and village of Crawley, in which parish there are about 500 inhabitants. Crawley is nearly at equal dis tances, from the main branch of the Test, from Winchester, and from the large village of Sutton on the south branch of the Test. The Winchester race-ground is on Worthy down, about two miles and a half to the eastward ; and be tween Crawley and Winchester there is situated the small village and parish of Littleton, the latter containing only about 120 inhabitants. From Crawley southward to the heights of Otterbourne, the western summit-level extends about eight miles on the straight line ; and this portion possesses considerable in terests both in a topographical and in an historical point of view. The great Roman road from Old Sarum to Win chester crossed it on the northern and most elevated part ; and here, as is usual in such cases, ancient encampments and other remains of antiquity are numerous. To the southward of the line of this road, there are also some places which are of peculiar interest to the antiquarian and historian, while the appearance of the country and the style of its cultivation are equally attractive to the agricul turist and the topographer."], [187, ""], [188, "HI UK 5 LIE Y PA'iKK.

The parish of Hursley occupies a large portion of this district ; and though great part of that parish lies to the west of the actual summit-level, and slopes upon the whole toward the Test ; yet it is so near to Winchester, and so closely connected with it, both historically and socially, that it may be considered as part of the home district of the city. Hursley is a large parish, and the most populous of all the rural parishes in the neighbourhood of Winchester, the number of inhabitants being upwards of 1400. It is also a very beautiful and very rich parish ; much varied in the surface, well wooded in many parts, containing a variety of soils, and well cultivated, though in dry seasons water is very deficient. Hursley Park, the seat of Sir William Heathcote, is the most remarkable object in the parish of Hursley, the more so that the park now contains the site of the old castle of Merdon, which is not a little connected with the history of Winchester in the days of its former splendour. The house itself, though now modernised, has also a tale to tell ; but the tales of both will require to be told at some length. Though Hursley is the name of the parish, the mansion and park, and the principal villages, yet Merdon is the name of the manor, and the castle of Merdon is the place within the manor which figures most conspicuously in an cient story. Hursley is usually said to mean \" wooded place ;\" but \" hill and dale,\" which is peculiarly expressive of the surface, appears to be fully as correct. Hurst, hirst, does not mean \" a wood,\" but rather \" a dry height,\" on which the soil is thin ; and ley, leigh, lea, does not mean a \" place\" generally, but a place favourable to the growth of grass, \u2014 a place which is lowen, or in the lee, or shelter, \u2014 hence the modern word \"lawn.\" Merdon may mean the hill fort by the pond or marsh ; and it is by no means im probable that when the country was much wooded there was a pond or marsh in the hollow. Be these matters as they may, the castle of Merdon was"], [190, "136 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. built by De Blois, bishop of Winchester, about the year 1 138 ; and, during the contest between Stephen and Maud the empress, it was strongly fortified by this bishop, who from the strongholds that he built appears to have been the most militant of all the Wintonian prelates \u2014 with the exception of Alwyn, who came into England as squire to Queen Emma, the fair maid of Normandy, and who, after gaining renown in the field as a soldier, exchanged the sword for the crosier, paying, somewhat simonaically, as is insinuated, the diffe rence in money. Emma is the same queen who, after being married, first to Ethelred the Saxon, and then to Canute the Dane, by the last of whom she had Hardicanute, and by the first Edward the Confessor, is said to have undergone the fiery ordeal in the nave of Winchester Cathedral, as the only means by which she could be cleared of the scandal of an illegal intercourse with Bishop Alwyn. The legend says, that she submitted to the ordeal in order to satisfy the scru ples of her son Edward ; and that, after due preparation, she was led harmlessly and triumphantly through the nine red hot ploughshares by two bishops, to her own glorious ac quittal, and the humiliating repentance of her pious son, who had unguardedly listened to insinuations against so pure a mother. So runs the tenor of the story \u2014 the truth or false hood of which we are not called upon to decide. This much however is certain, that, if there is truth in the tale of the trial, the necessity of acquittal, even admitting the frailty of the fair though then somewhat faded Emma, is involved in the very circumstances of the case. If Emma was guilty, the bishop who was the alleged paramour, and who had accompanied her from the court of her father Earl Robert of Normandy, when she came to give her virgin hand to Ethel red, could not be quite innocent. It is true that he had been a soldier, and that the frailty may have overtaken him when in that capacity ; and not only this, but that he may have taken first the cowl, and then the mitre, in order the more fully and fervently to repent him for the 'sins of his military youth. But still, Alwyn the bishop was the same"], [191, "137 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. identical man with Alwyn the cavalier ; and the queen could not have been convicted of a liaison with him in the one capacity, without some blame attaching to himself in the other. This would, even in those days, have brought some little scandal upon the church ; and on this account, the two bishops would naturally lead Emma as clear of the burning shares as possible. But, whether this be reality or romance, Bishop De Blois certainly built and fortified the castle of Merdon, about 66 years after the demise of Emma, and thus about the same time that he built the strong castle of Wolvesey, at Winches ter. It was for a considerable time one of the country resi dences of the bishop ; and though the fortifications fell into decay, a portion of the keep was habitable as late as the beginning of the seventeenth century. Since then it has been gradually mouldering away ; is now included and con cealed in the park of Hursley Lodge ; and even the well, which is said to have been 300 feet deep and 9 feet in dia meter, has been covered up. The manor belonged to the bishops of Winchester till the reign of Edward VI. ; but since that time it has been held by a succession of temporal lords. A considerable portion of it, if not the whole, appears to have become church property in the time of the Saxons, and to have been by them let in copyholds, as the copyhold tenure is \"Borough-English,\" which is peculiar to Saxon grants. By this holding the tenement descends to the youngest son \u2014 or daughter when there are no sons, and failing issue, to the youngest of the nearest in blood to the holder, however remote. The cus toms of this manor which are curious, as they relate to the copyholders, though too long for our insertion, were settled by the Court of Chancery at the end of the seventeenth century ; and they are not especially calculated to promote the improvement of those holdings to which they apply. There is one old decision, that these tenures, like the \" Gavel kind\" in Kent, are not subject to escheat for felony on the part of the holder, but we are not aware of any recent case upon which the point has been raised. VOL. I. R"], [192, "138 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. After its alienation from the bishops of Winchester, the manor of Merdon passed through several hands ; and at length came into those of Richard Cromwell, the son and heir of Oliver the Protector, by his marriage with Dorothy the daughter of Maijor, the then lord of the manor, who was one of Oliver's Privy Councillors. The chief historical interest of Merdon, or Hursley, arises from its having been the property and the residence of Richard Cromwell. It appears that Oliver, perceiving from the mild character of Richard that he was not adapted for the same sturdy and stormy life as himself; and, knowing the money-making propensities of Maijor, became match maker, and had Richard married to Dorothy, and the manor settled on her and her offspring, when Richard was in his 23rd year. In 1660 Richard became lord of the manor, in right of his wife. At the Restoration, Richard went abroad, and resided there for twenty years. On his return, he did not claim the manor, which was then in the possession of his son Oliver ; but on the death of the son he put in his claim, which was resisted by his daughters, who had taken possession. Richard brought his case to trial, and had to appear in court when he had passed his eightieth year. The Lord Chief Justice treated him with unusual respect, directing him to remain covered while in court ; for which his lordship is said to have been warmly commended by Queen Anne, in whose reign the occurrence took place. An order of court was made in his favour ; and it is reported that, upon leaving the court, he wandered carelessly into the House of Lords, and remained there till the House rose, when a stranger then asked him whether he had ever seen such a place, to which he replied, pointing to the throne, \"Never since I sat in that chair,\" \u2014 which was nearly half a century previous. This was in 1706, after which time Richard resided occasionally at Hursley, till his death, which happened at Cheshunt in 1712, after he had completed his 86th year ; and sixty-three years after his mar riage to Dorothy Maijor. Richard appears to have been a very amiable man in private life ; and his kindness to his"], [193, "139 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. tenants at Hursley was remembered long after his death. Richard's daughters came into possession of Hursley after his demise ; but they retained it only six years, having sold it to Sir William Heathcote in the year 1718. Though Sir William purchased the manor of the Cromwells, he had an aversion to the house which had been their dwelling, and in which even Oliver himself had been a guest. Accordingly he had it pulled down and re-built ; and in the course of the former operation, a piece of old rusty metal was found, which proved to be the seal of the Commonwealth of England ; but how it came to be hidden in a hole of the wall at Hurs ley does not appear. The old mansion was a long and low structure in the Elizabethan style, 'with a large oriel win dow over the arched entrance. The present mansion is more modern in its plan. The park is more than a mile in length, tastefully planted, and containing extensive pleasure grounds near the house. It has belonged to the Heathcote family ever since the purchase from the daughters of Richard Crom well : they have uniformly taken a warm interest in the wel fare of the county, and have often been its representatives in the Commons' House. The village of Hursley contains some good houses, but it is straggling. The situation is pleasant ; but in dry weather there is no water except what is drawn from wells. It is upon the road from Winchester to Romsey, and about four miles and a half distant from the former. The present parish church is a modern erection, with the exception of the tower, having been built about the middle of the eighteenth century. The old building which was then in a very ruinous state is said to have been remarkably low ; and there is some reason to believe that it remained as the model, if not wholly of the materials, at least of the time, of the Saxons. Within the church of Hursley there are no monuments of very ancient date, and the one of most interest is that of the Cromwell family, with whom the Maijors are intermixed, making in all about a dozen of names, of which, however r 2"], [194, "140 SEVEN 4MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. the only one of public interest is that of Richard. Hursley is only a vicarage enjoying the small tythes; but Otter bourne is conjoined with it to eke out the living. It is somewhat singular that so much of the Saxon cus tom should remain in the manor of Hursley, especially the Borough-English holding, while the common succession of primogeniture is established in most other places of the county. This cannot be owing to the fact of the manor being church property before the conquest; for there are many of the manors which were church property then, and not a few which are church property still, in which no such holding is known. It is understood that the \"men of Kent\" preserved their tenure of \" Gavel-kind,\" in consequence of the bravery with which they resisted the Conqueror ; but there could be nothing of this kind in so small a place as Hursley. It may have been owing to Bishop Henry de Blois, who was as powerful as he was pugnacious, but this is mere con jecture. On an elevated locality about two miles to the south of Hursley, Cranbury House is situated. This is a large man sion, commanding pleasant and extensive views ; and, upon the adjoining common are those traces of extensive encamp ments of the times of old, to which allusion has already been made, but of which the details are interesting to the speculative antiquaries only \u2014 as it is impossible to tell to what people they should be referred. Roman memorials have been found near them ; but as the Roman road from Nutshalling, or Nursling, to Winchester, passes at no great distance, it is impossible to say whether the memorials are connected with the road or the encampments, or whether the one or the other of them be the more ancient. From the very earliest records of history down to the latest period at which the sword was drawn for the unseemly purposes of civil war in England, the home district of Win chester was the scene of active hostility or of party intrigue. Indeed, it is highly probable that there were battles here, far more important than those internal squabbles between tribe"], [195, "141 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. and tribe, which have always been peculiarly characteristic of the Celts under all their denominations ; and of which there are but too many traces among the people of the more exclusively Celtic districts of Ireland, even at the present time, and without any relation to habitual or religious ani mosities or agitations. We may remark in passing, that these squabbles between sept and sept, by preventing that union among the Celts which would have enabled them to act as a nation, appears to have been the causes why, in all countries which they have been known to inhabit, and which have had value to tempt the cupidity of invaders, the Celts have invariably been a conquered people. It was certainly not on account of their pacific nature, or their want of physical courage that the Celtic races thus yielded to every invader ; for they are naturally more pugnacious than any of those other races by whom they were subdued, and when disciplined and led, their descendants still make good soldiers very much in proportion as they are of the pure blood. We have no certain information as to the cause, the time, or the manner, of the establishment of the Belg\u00e6 in the Winchester district, though there seems to be no good reason for doubting the fact of their having been there at the time when the Romans arrived. Now, it is impossible to suppose that the Celts, even granting that they were an earlier colony from the same quarter and of the same race, would have tame ly yielded up their woods and wigwams to the Belgic in vaders ; hence, it is probable that many of the ancient and almost obliterated entrenchments, with which this district abounds, are anterior to the Roman invasion, and the work of warriors of whom not a trace remains upon any other re cord. Some such caution as this is absolutely necessary for those who study a district like this, of which the early history lies far in the mist of days gone by, and where, though the frag ments of the monument have been spared, the inscriptions have been wholly obliterated, even before men had learned to"], [196, "142 SEVEN MILES ROUND WINCHESTER. read. This caution is the more necessary on account of the tempting nature of the district, and also because the antiqua rian scribes of modern times are just as prone to \" dream dreams,\" as the monastic chroniclers of old were to \"see visions.\" One cannot close even the most hasty sketch of this part of Hampshire without feelings of regret that, notwithstand ing the industry and zeal with which the early history, of Winchester in particular, has been investigated, so little is known of the state of the district, and the character, and even the relative numbers of its inhabitants, during the vicissi tudes of the many centuries during which it bore a promi nent part in the affairs of England. Even in the case of the princes and prelates that figured here, there are many dark and deceitful points ; but the history of \" life and measures \" is almost one continuous blank."], [197, ""], [198, "ENVIRONS OF SOUTHAMPTON.

This district, which occupies the lower or seaward portion of the valley of the Itchen, is different in its natural charac- ter from the upper valley, and far more limited in extent than that of which Winchester is the centre. Its history, as read in its own aspect, also forms a strong contrast, Here, there are no remains of regal pomp or episcopal magnificence ; nor is there any evidence that this part of the county was ever either more fertile or more populous than it is in the present day. It is not seen far or to advantage through the mist of time ; and therefore, \u2014 to him who loves to muse on the mutability of human affairs, and read the annals of men and of nations, in that earth which supported them while alive and received their bones, when the toils and the pleasures, the sorrows and the joys, the cruelties and the kindnesses of life were over, \u2014 the attractions which it has are compara- tively few. There are, no doubt, some remains of antiquity: a ruined abbey or priory, in some nook more sheltered and fertile in the abbey-building days than the average of the district around; a few old, but not very old churches; a gate; a ruined wall; a half-filled moat; the traces of a haven for gallies ; or the print of an old encampment on the moor. But, in so far as the strife of man with man, or of race with"], [200, "144 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. race \u2014 the longest and loudest tale which the monumental earth or the recording annalist has to tell \u2014 is concerned, these are the memorials of outworks, for the defence or the capture of some more enticing and valuable object, and not the immediate bulwarks of that object itself. It is not said, or meant to be implied in these remarks, that either the district or the town of Southampton is without at tractions, or to raise any question as to the merits of the one or the other. These will be noticed afterwards, briefly, but with every wish to be strictly impartial ; and all that is now alleged is, that, in the olden time, the lower valley of the Itchen was not so much an object of desire as the upper \u2014 the coast country of Hampshire generally as that which was more inland. Thus far, the evidence is complete and conclusive : without the circuit of the old walls, there is not a single old church in the whole three miles long and two miles broad, which formed the County of Southampton and now forms the parliamentary extent of the borough ; and, while, early churchmen and pious kings were continually adding manor after manor of the upper country to the then sacred endow ments in Winchester, it does not appear that there was, save Millbrook, a single acre of this district, worthy of a bishop or abbot to ask, or a monarch to bestow. This is the true index to the comparative value of diffe rent parts of the country in those days when the produce of the land was all its wealth, though it is too often overlooked by historians and topographers, who will not or cannot ana lyse the causes of the present state of a district, and assign to nature and to man their proper shares. The soil itself affords ample corroboration of this ; for large tracts are still productive of nothing but stunted heather, with only an inch or two of its own black ruins between it and the gravel ; and there is little doubt that most of the heights were once of this description, and that the shelving shores of the Southampton water were pebbly beaches, until they came in the course of years to be covered with mud from the upper and naturally richer country, whence the waters and"], [201, "145 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. the winds have been for ages conspiring to transfer it to this its final place of deposite, until some future revolution of the globe shall cover it with a new stratum, or raise it again above the mean level of the sea. Of the nature of any such revolution, not even a guess can be formed ; for, though there are various strata, they are all of that description which has been formed by gradual deposites, or by the long continued action of the water upon the land. There are successive formations of different consistencies in different places ; and there are traces of surface disturbance where these meet ; but there is not a trace of volcanic action. The chance of invasion in early days, and the danger of pirates in times less remote, may have operated upon the fears both of the people as cultivators, and of the holy fathers as enjoyers of the fat of the land; but the effect of these could have been but partial ; for, though they prevented that artificial improvement of much of the surface which has been effected in modern times, they could not occasion the natural sterility, which is original, and not a deterioration occasioned by human neglect. Therefore, we must look upon this as comparatively a modern district, both in its fertility and its population ; and consequently, its chief interest lies in its present state and its future prospects, much more than in its past history. No doubt, as containing the port to Winches ter, and to the whole of the rich country opened up by the valley of the Itchen, the Roman road, and whatever means of communication the more early inhabitants may have had with the sea, for that foreign trade in which they are said to have been engaged even then, the lower Itchen, especially the estuary or tidal part, must always have had an interest ; but its interest, at least till times comparatively recent, seems always to have been that of a mere place of transit, and not of consumption or production ; and we must bear this in mind when we come to notice the present state and future prospects of Southampton as a town and a port; but before doing this, it will be proper to take up the sketch of the county at the point where we left off in the preceding chap- VOL. i. s"], [202, "146 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. ter. Of this, there are two natural sections, \u2014 the river val ley from Otterbourne to the sea-lock on the barge river ; and the estuaral part, containing the old county, or present burghal liberty of Southampton, with some of the banks and downs on the east or left-hand side of the water. LOWER VALLEY OF THE ITCHEN. From the junction of the small brook at Otterbourne to the sea-lock at Wood Mill, South Stoneham, the distance on the straight line is exactly five miles ; but allowing for the windings, the course of the Itchen is about seven miles and a half, and the length of the barge navigation about seven miles. The bottom here is clay, or gravel, or a mixture of the two, all naturally impervious to water, and rendered more so, as far as the floods extend, by the chalky deposites left by these. Here, the meadows, where there is little slope, contain peat and yield a coarse herbage ; but in many places the grass is more kindly, and the meadows are of conside rable breadth. Peat earth is most abundant, and the herbage coarsest, between Otterbourne and Bishop's Stoke, \u2014 about a mile in length to the closings in of the banks below the first and nearly at the second ; while farther down, the hollow is more dry ; and, in some places, spotted with wood and laid out in grazing or sheep grounds. On both these basins of the valley, the soils on the slopes are gravel and plastic clay, the last predominating most on the eastern side ; but from Wood Mill where the water-meadows, and also the canal navigation end, gravel more or less mixed with clay, and occasionally with sand, predominates on both sides of the river. The slopes toward both sides of this part of the Itchen are wooded ; but, as the summits are approached, the trees become smaller in size, and the boles and larger branches of them are covered with lichen. They are generally of small height and very much branched ; but there are some very fine oaks on the richer grounds near the river; and"], [203, "147 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. the less valuable trees, such as elms, limes, sycamores, and horse chesnuts, thrive well. The same may be said of the cone-bearing family, particularly the larch, though the Scotch fir appears to have been the favourite when those woods were planted. Altogether, this part of the valley as seen from the bank of the river, appears richer than about and above Winchester ; but the heights have not the same kindly turf upon them ; and, owing to the admixture of clay and its retentive nature, the earth is colder and the air less salu brious. There is one good summer-indication of the change of climate which one meets in descending this valley ; and that is the diminished numbers of the swallow tribe. Shakspeare was right in stating that these birds resort most where the air \"smells wooingly,\" \u2014 though if he had visited Inverness he would not have found them very numerous there. Where there are many swallows, there are of course many day-flies, the chief food of the tribe; and the preyers are fewer in places where the prey is not so abundant. With the exception of a portion on the right bank to the south-west of Otterbourne, the water-sheds or natural boun daries of this part of the valley are not, on the average, above two miles from the river, though from the flatness of the summits, and the absence of running streams, the abso lute lines of these levels are not easily determined. There are, indeed, a few brooks, but they are nameless and insigni ficant, and in the drought of summer quite dry. Notwith standing this, the crops upon the fields are vigorous, owing in part no doubt to the watering of the meadows, which con stantly sends a cool and humid atmosphere toward the slopes, \u2014 not an atmosphere out of which rain is formed, but still one from which the leaves of living plants can extract moisture, and from which dew is condensed as the earth gains its nocturnal maximum of cold. Parish churches are by no means numerous upon either bank here. Between Otterbourne and Southampton, there are but three on the right bank which can be at all consi- s2"], [204, "148 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. dered as included in the valley of the Itchen, and on the left there is only one ; whereas, on the same length of valley above Winchester, there are one or two within sight of the river. The first that occurs below Otterbourne, on the right bank, two miles southward, and one mile from the meadows by the river, is North Stoneham. This is a parish of considerable extent, having a valued rental of 3,500/. and a population of about 760. The principal mansion in this parish, and indeed almost the only one, is Stoneham park, the seat of J. Fleming, Esq. one of the parliamentary mem bers for the southern division of the county, and long one of its representatives as a whole. He is the proprietor of the old salmon-leap near the seacock of the barge navigation \u2014 an obstacle which has long been fatal to the Itchen as a salmon river ; a purpose for which the purity of its waters and the abundance and excellence of its trout, show that it is naturally well adapted. No blame, we believe, attaches to the present lord of the manor of Stoneham, for the exclusion of this prince of fishes from the upper part of the Itchen \u2014 indeed from the whole river above the tideway. But the mere fact of any one being blameable or blameless does not affect the amount of the evil which ensues ; and, from the accounts, as well as from the natural analogies, the evil in this case is a serious one. It is so currently reported, as to show that there is truth in it, that in former times salmon were so plentiful in the Itchen that, as is said, a stipulation was made on binding a Winchester apprentice, that he should not be compelled to eat salmon from the river oftener than twice a week ; whereas now, there are not very many inhabitants of the city who can have Itchen salmon twice a month ; and north country salmon, brought via London, and thence to Win chester by the coaches, is not higher in price than salmon from the leap, or from the estuary below it. Now, there is no physical reason why salmon should not still be as plentiful in the Itchen as they were at any former period. There is nothing to contaminate the water of the"], [205, "149 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. river, and its quantity cannot have very much diminished within a pretty long period of years. But salmon do not deposite their spawn in the tidal beaches of estuaries ; and thus, though a few of them come into the estuary, and are caught at the barrier of the leap, the Itchen is not now, in any sense of the word, a salmon river ; and therefore the pro prietor of the impediment \u2014 how exclusive soever may be the advantage he derives from it \u2014 furnishes a practical instance of the fable of the \"boy and the goose.\" Not one salmon is now bred in any part of the river; and, as it is a well known instinct of all the migratory salmonidce, and indeed of all migrant animals, that the law of their nature brings them, all unknown to themselves, to rear their broods in the locality where they themselves were reared, not a single salmon can come to the estuary or the leap as to its native stream. All that make their appearance there are strays, which may or may not come, according to circumstances, of which man has no knowledge and consequently can have no controul. Let us put a parallel case: \u2014 Suppose any pro prietor were to lay out a portion of his land as a preserve for hares and pheasants, and furnish it with with all things dainty to the palates of these the daintiest of all terrestrial and aerial game; and further, when he had done so, sup pose him to inclose it with a net-work, hare and pheasant proof, and plant it around with traps and snares, to capture all that it attracted, \u2014 how high on the roll of wisdom would you inscribe the name of such a proprietor4? South Stoneham is the next parish to North Stoneham on the same bank of the river; and it is more valuable, having a higher rental and a more numerous population \u2014 the first being upwards of 5,500/. and the last consisting of more than 2,700 human beings. Thus the rental, though con siderably greater in amount than that of North Stoneham, bears a lower ratio to the number of inhabitants. The church of this parish is about a mile and a quarter south of that of the former, very near the river, and close by the sea lock and the salmon-leap already alluded to."], [206, "150 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. Chilworth, the remaining parish on this bank of the river, is comparatively small, having a valued rental of only 550/. and a population of 150. It lies on the top of the downs, the church being near the summit-level, and about a quarter of a mile to the right of the old Roman road from Winchester to Nutshalling, or Nursling, as it is pronounced, and written, according to the modern corruption. The high road from Winchester to Southampton passes nearly mid way between the churches of the two parishes last named, and about a mile and a quarter from each, the direction of the one from the other being north-west and south-east. The left bank of the Itchen, though narrower upon the whole from the margin of the river to the water-shed, is richer both in its fields and its woods, contains stronger lands, and has the river nearer to the bottom of its slopes. It is true that there is no rivulet on this bank of the river equal in length to one on the other, which has its source on the downs about a mile south of Hursley, has several branches near its source, runs for about six miles southward by the Stonehams, and empties its waters into the Itchen a little above the sea-lock of the navigation ; but still, though there is no brook equal to this on the eastern bank, that part of the valley is, upon the whole the more rich and beautiful, \u2014 the gravelly and clayey lands opposite this part of the Itchen, extending, with no great elevation, eastward to the^Hamble. Farther down the character of the high grounds is very different. Bishops Stoke is the only parish in this richly wooded part of the eastern bank. The church and village are beau tifully situated, the former close by the bank of the river, with which the barge-course forms an inosculation a little above, but they part again at this point. The church is mo dern, but built in imitation of the ancient structures, with stained glass in the windows ; and there are two shattered yew trees of great antiquity, one west of the church and the other east. The village is straggling, one part of it lying scattered along the road to Winchester, and the other along"], [207, ""], [208, "f.-w,/ /'/./\u25a0/ts/i... . bbins, CoUeoe Street.. FruiUl t>y Itusstil"], [209, "151 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. the bank of the water-course, or pond, of the \" Old Custom Mill.\" The cottages here form a crescent, with a broad road and fine canal of water before them ; and the opposite bank of the canal is richly wooded, showing neither bark nor stem, but one mass of foliage with the tops of the sprays playing in the transparent water. The other parts of the village are embowered in stately trees . Several good houses are scattered about ; the grounds are very rich ; the whole sheltered from every angry wind ; and altogether, it is diffi cult to find, or even imagine, a sweeter place. One plain modern box has thrust itself among the trees across the mill pond, not quite in keeping with the rural character of the place ; and between that and the church there is another, in the true pastry-cook style \u2014 which looks as much out of place, as if a city beau of the first water had been soused in the Itchen as a second watering, and then set on the bank of the river to dry. Still, the situation of the village is such, and the vigour of rural nature so much prevails over the inroads of art, that it can better afford to bear the infliction of a freak or two than most other villages. It is not unworthy of remark, that a little above this delightful village, the cha racter of the meadows changes from peat to a better soil, and the rank bog plants give place to a more kindly herbage, \u2014 the broad meadows below Bishop's Stoke furnishing most ex cellent hay, and still further down, lawn-like fields of very sweet pasturage. Bishop's Stoke is a rich and populous parish ; the valued rent is about 4,700/. and the population upwards of 1000. With the exception of South Stoneham and it is the most populous rural parish abutting on the Itchen, and the valued rent bears a much higher pro portion to the number of inhabitants than in either of these. With this finely situated and valuable parish, we must close our notice of the valley of the Itchen, considered as a fresh water river, \u2014 a valley which, though of limited extent, is of great beauty, and which derives much additional interest from once having stood in the same relation to a very consi derable portion of England as the valley of the Thames"], [210, "152 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. now does to the whole territories and dependencies of the British government; and perhaps the two valleys pretty correctly express the ratio of the former kingdom and the present empire. ESTUARY OF THE ITCHEN. Still regarding the river as its principal feature, we shall now take a rapid glance at the district which formed the ancient county, and which now forms the modern liberty of the town of Southampton, together with as much of the left bank of the country, without the county or borough, as shall approach the very indefinite water-shed between the Itchen and the Hamble. The river itself is the chief natural obj ect ; and when the tide is up it is a very fine one, but at low water there is an unseemly extent of mud. At high-water, the breadth in many parts is from three furlongs to half a mile, but at low water, the channel is nowhere more than one furlong across \u2014 even at Itchen Ferry which is within less than a mile of the middle deep of the Southampton water. The entire length of the tidal estuary, from the sea-lock at Wood Mill to this ferry, is about two miles and a half on the straight line ; but it is three miles and a half along the middle deep of the channel, and still more along the high-water line. The flexures which produce this additional length are, of course, considerable ; and they are graceful ; so that, with the richly wooded and diversified surfaces ofthe banks, the appearance of this little estuary is very beautiful. The first flexure is towards the west or right>hand, approaching the village of Portswood ; and then to the east, the length of each of the bends being about half a mile, and the average breadth at high-water about a furlong. The next turning is to the right, about half a mile in extreme breadth with an island dividing the channel. The ground on the left bank rises rather abruptly here, and continues on to Bitterne, the situ ation of the Roman port of Clausentum, which is opposite"], [211, "m ietW fn pi \u00ab\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'\u25a0"], [212, ""], [213, ""], [214, "HEAP. .\u2022:n \u25a0 n; \u201e,-/,,. ,1.1 I;,i.i,.i\u201e,i /,., Hi, I,../,,,./,,, .i\u201e-/t. /./.,\u201e.. ,:.//.."], [215, "153 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. to the island above alluded to. On the low meadow above Bitterne, and upon the opposite bank of the river, are the ruins of the Priory of St. Dionysius. The situation is a meadow, \u2014 one of the richest spots in the Southampton dis trict, and finely sheltered and secluded. Bitterne is on a narrow point, around which the river again winds to the left, with high grounds upon that bank, and on the opposite one the village of Northam, now united to Southampton ; and from this point to the main channel of the Southampton Water, the estuary of the Itchen may be considered as a tide harbour ; and one which, if there were sufficient inducement, might be rendered as commodious as it is safe. This is indeed one of the most beautiful little estuaries in Britain \u25a0 and one of the safest, because, the flexures, the high banks, and the woods shelter it from every wind; and, as the principal trade of the port of Southampton with the rest of the country \u2014 if it is ever to have such a trade to any extent, must be by the line of the Itchen, this estuary seems entitled to more consideration than it has hitherto met with from those who have taken a leading part in the projects for the accomplishment of this purpose. We shall afterwards have occasion to notice these pro jects, and perhaps to offer a few hints as to their probable results ; but we may now notice, as one of the natural fea tures of the district, that this estuary is by far the most improvable water at Southampton \u2014 more so than the broader estuary, which extends north-west from the town about four miles, to Redbridge, where it receives the waters of the Test. Above the town, the beach of this last-named es tuary is so shallow, that the water ebbs back three furlongs in some places ; and a perfume, not quite of the same ge nus with that of \" Araby the blest,\" is given out by the mud in hot weather. A stranger passing along the north bank of the Test estuary, marvels at seeing the print of an abortive canal along the beach ; \u2014 and a rail-road, not only along the estuary of the Itchen, but passing for nearly half a-mile within the tidal shore of that estuary, opposite Bit- VOL I. t"], [216, "154 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. terne, has the air of a project of the same kind, how much soever the ultimate advantage may be better than the present promise. Along the winding shores of the estuary, above the Itchen ferry, at which point there is no considerable deposite of mud, there are, in round numbers, about three hundred acres of tidal banks, all of which might be recovered by embankments of ten or twelve feet \u2014 the first of these num bers being the rise of the tide ; and about twenty acres are already embanked, where the rail-road crosses the basin op posite to Bitterne. The filling up of these, by dredging, might have prepared ample space for wet docks in the vici nity, at Northam ; and thus a mile, at least, of the rail-way might have been saved, the expense of which would have gone a considerable way in making the requisite excavation. It seems, however, that the works have been begun upon no general plan ; and thus, the attempted improvement of one place may be a bar to that of another. \u2014 But we must not anticipate. The left bank of the estuary, opposite Southampton, has received a pleasant and fertile appearance, by means of arti ficial planting, and culture, and the assistance of a fine cli mate ; but the soil is naturally bad ; and, at an average dis tance of about a mile from the river, it passes into one of the most sterile heaths in the south of England. This is the common, or heath, of Weston and Netley, stretching about two miles from north to south, and three from east to west ; but of irregular form, partially planted, and still more par tially cultivated, in some places. This occupies the summit level, and may be taken as the natural eastern boundary of the Southampton district, though the whole of it is beyond the parliamentary one as defining the limits of the borough. Along the coast there are cultivated grounds, and some choice spots, such as that at the ruins of Netley Abbey, (of which we shall speak by and by,) but these are fertile rather than rich, and owe much more to climate and culture than to the nature of the soil. The heath itself, notwith-"], [217, "155 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. standing the barrenness of its present aspect, has all the aerial elements of fertility ; and though there is little vege table soil upon it, the gravel of which it is composed is not, at so trifling an elevation as it has above the level of the sea, the very worst of sub-soils. It is generally speaking a firm gravel capable of retaining mould and manure, and not that loose and hungry sand, which drinks up every thing and is none the richer. Though cold in winter, from the freedom with which the winds sweep over it, and the consequently rapid evaporation of whatever moisture may have fallen upon it, this moor or heath is very healthy ; and the prospects from it are exten sive and delightful, both in the direction of the Southamp ton Water, the New Forest, and the Isle of Wight, and in that of the upper country, especially the valley of the Itchen, with its banks and adjunct downs. On the right, or Southampton side of the estuary, the natural district of the town, as defined by the water-shed, is more extensive, and it very nearly coincides with the parli amentary limits of the borough. The western boundary is nearly coincident with the stream of Millbrook, which rises in Chilworth common to the west of Stoneham park, and after a southerly course of about five miles, empties itself into the Southampton water, or estuary of the Test, at the village of the same name. It is not the brook, however, but the eastern edge of the grounds sloping towards the brook, which forms the boundary here, though, like most water-sheds in Hampshire, it cannot be .well expressed by any definite line. If we except the descent towards the Itchen, which is more abrupt, as the general elevation of the district be comes greater, the general surface has a gradual ascent from the sea northwards. From the old walled-town to Itchen ferry, and thence northward to the basin which the Itchen forms at Bitterne, the surface is but little elevated ; and, were it not for the embankments, part of it would be over flowed when there are high tides and freshes. The basin t 2"], [218, "156 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. of this portion is gravel, containing many water-rounded nodules of flint, and covered with a greater or less depth of chalky deposite, similar to that of which the present tidal shores are composed. Hence it is natural to conclude, that, at some early period of its history, the Itchen had a clear opening, with pebbly shores, as far up as Bitterne ; and the destruction of the woods, which once covered the downs in the upper country, no doubt occasioned the descent, by the river, of the mud which has accumulated here. The western part of the town stands higher above the level of the water, and beyond the town, the ascent of the bank is a little ab rupt, though by no means high. In the bight which the shore forms here, there is an extensive accumulation of mud, from which the tide ebbs back, in some places, to the extent of a furlong and a half. We shall have some remarks to offer on the formation of these mud-banks when we come to take a general view of the south coast of Hampshire, which we purpose to do in the second volume of this work ; so that, in the mean time, we shall mention merely, that these banks are a sad eye-sore when the water leaves them ; and, that the estuary itself appears a giant or a dwarf, according as it is high-water or low. This is, perhaps, some injury to Southampton as a watering place, for which it is in other respects admirably suited. In defence of the banks, it may be said, that although they are unsightly, they are not in any way injurious to health. The air from them has a marine smell no doubt ; but it is certainly in no high degree miasmatic. Where the sea comes and goes, there can be no stagnation, neither is there time for putrefaction between tide and tide \u2014 nor much of a putrescent nature upon a shore like this. Yet one desiderates the clean sand or the bright pebbles, and regrets the impracticability of a ready plunge at any hour into the ocean itself, which is incomparably better than the most splendid bath which art can form. Still, there are many circumstances connected with South ampton which entitle it to a preference over most watering places : the land journey to it is one of the most delightful"], [219, "157 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. in England, and it is accomplished with much ease in a sin gle day from the metropolis ; the air has all the freshness of that on the east coast and none of its fury ; the town, though well-furnished with every necessary of life, is yet so far provincial ; and the walks, drives, and water-trips, are almost unequalled for their beauty, their variety, and their safety, not only from real danger, but from all apprehension and annoyance. The downs and commons behind Southampton, though dry and elevated, are by no means insusceptible of cultiva tion, though they were for a long time much neglected. Of late years they have profited by the general spirit of improvement ; but of the extent to which they have profited, we can speak with more propriety, when we come to treat of the town as our principal subject. For the few extra burghal subjects which require to be named, we must return to the bank of the Itchen ; and there we find the situation of a Roman port, the ruins of a priory, one or two modern residences of some note, and the passage boat at Itchen Ferry, which is one of the most commodious in the kingdom. Clausentum, the Roman port and station, is now a subject for the antiquaries only ; but it is necessary that the gene ral reader, who takes an interest in the early history of the country, should know where the Romans effected their land ing, secured their galleys, and carried on their export trade, from the valley of the Itchen. Not merely this, but there is some reason to infer from the situation of the Roman port so far from the Southampton channel, that the river was not so much silted up in their days as it is now. The Roman remains which have been found at Bitterne, and nowhere else, clearly establish the fact of its having been the locality \u2014 not a camp or occasional residence, but a regular fort. Coins, urns, and pottery, occurring in a few specimens, would not have been sufficient to establish the fact, but these have been met with too abundantly for being a merely casual deposite; and accompanied by more conclusive memo rials of the nature of the station here. Fragments of walls"], [220, "158 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. have been found, nine feet in thickness, and similar to those of the Roman forts, or permanent stations, at Silchester and other places. The body of the walls appears, as at Silches ter, to have consisted of rubble flints, grouted with mortar, and faced with small stones, only the banding-courses were bricks at Clausentum, and flat stones at Silchester. Frag ments both of the finer and the coarser kind of pottery were met with, the last of which had evidently been thrown on the wheel, as plain ware is at the present time. Glass was also found, though much less abundantly ; and frag ments of sculpture ; but nothing, we believe, in a perfect state, except the coins. Amongst these coins it does not appear that any of those of the early emperors have been met with ; from which we may conclude that Clausentum did not become a permanent station till some time after the Romans had established themselves in England ; but there has been nothing found which tended to throw any light on the pre cise epoch of its foundation. As little is there any evidence of the time at which the station was razed. It is probable, however, that this station may have been dismantled by the Saxons during their piratical incursions on the coast, in the latter part of the fifth century, before they obtained a per manent footing and ascendancy in the country. There is no reason to suppose that there was any port or fortified station at Southampton in the time of the Romans ; but this is a point which may be more advantageously reserved for future consideration. The Priory of St. Dionysius, or Dennis, on the opposite bank of the reach of the estuary just above Clausentum, is the only monastic remain which we are called upon to notice in this district, without the town of Southampton. This, like all the houses of the monastic brethren, was situated in the choicest spot which the neighbourhood afforded ; and it was not established till the conclusion of all that may be called the great foreign invasions of the country. It is said that Henry I, the younger son of the Conqueror, who suc ceeded his brother Rufus, and in whom the pure race of our"], [221, "159 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. Norman monarchs terminated by his marriage with Matilda or Mold, daughter of Malcolm king of Scotland, and repre sentative of the ancient Saxon kings, founded this priory in 1124, five years before his death, This royal lady had resided as a nominal nun in the abbey of St. Mary at Win chester, probably in the hope of some such chance as this ; and we can readily understand why, from the influence that she had over her husband, Winchester should have flourished so much, and so much should have been bestowed upon the church, during this reign. Various succeeding monarchs and others bestowed lands and other gifts upon this priory, which remained until the general dissolution of those es tar blishments by Henry VIII. There are no important parti culars of its history recorded : only, one of the priors is said to have purchased a French bishopric of the pope, and to have suddenly thereafter died by the visitation of God, as a punishment for this simonaical proceeding \u2014 a proceeding which was not very rare in those days. Nor does it appear that this establishment ever obtained much distinction as a place of sepulture for the great; so that, when the stone coffins which were found in the ruins were used for hogs' troughs, and applied to other ignoble purposes, the last abodes of none ofthe \"mighty dead\" \u2014 if in the judgment of philo sophy there can be might in the place of sepulture \u2014 were desecrated. The reason why none but comparatively name less persons were laid in the dust at this priory, seems to have been the absence of sainted relics, which were, in those days of superstition, considered too precious for being left so near to invading enemies. Great personages, if they felt that they stood in need of great intercession \u2014 which was often the case in those turbu lent times, were solicitous of having their bones laid in an establishment containing other bones which were cano nized ; for, if such relics could do much for the living \u2014 as was sedulously inculcated, it followed, by parity of cre dence, that they could do more for their fellow moulderers ; and though, according to our modern notions, it seems bor-"], [222, "160 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. dering on absurdity to suppose that a proximity of bones after death could have any influence in the delivering of souls from suffering, it was the interest of those who minis tered in the chapel in days gone by, that this matter should be viewed in another light. There is little doubt that the monastic institutions acquired that very large share of the worldly possessions of the great, which they held in the day of their ascendency, upon the very same principle as they got the earthly remains of the donors. Those were sin-offer ings ; and, so far as authentic history is clear on the point \u2014 monastic histories are always cloudy \u2014 the gifts made to these institutions, by such as lived till time-subdued passions and weariness of the world brought them to repentance, were much in the ratio of their enormities in the day of their worldly ambition and enjoyment. Such a belief in pur chased forgiveness is natural to men whose minds have been disciplined to the practices of the world only ; and accordingly, traces of it are to be found at the present time. But they are waxing fewer and fainter every day ; and therefore, the site of an ancient priory or abbey, whose ruins tune the mind to the proper feeling, is the fittest place for moralising upon this solemn and not uninstructive subject. St. Dennis', however, is now no way a fitting place for meditation : \u2014 the rail-way has cleft through its seclusion, though not absolutely through its foundations. In the case of the priory, however, the hissing of the en gines, the volumed smoke, the trundling wheels, and the multitude of voices, which it is anticipated that the rail-way will bring, in quick succession, through this former solitude, will not in any way disturb the appropriate inhabitants. But upon the abodes of living men, some of which stand \u2014 or stood \u2014 sweetly in their embowering groves upon the high grounds overlooking the estuary, the effect will be different. Of these, we can afford to mention only two, Portswood Place and Bevis' Mount. The situations of both are plear sant, and considering their proximity to a town so large and bustling as Southampton, they used formerly to be retired."], [223, "161 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. Of Portswood House, not much can be said farther than that it is a handsome dwelling, and these are so abundant in the county that the remark is no more complimentary than it would be to tell a Hampshire farmer that his fields were kept in neat order. Bevis' Mount has some story to tell, both legendary and literary. It derives the first part of its name from that doughty offspring of romance, Sir Bevois of Hampton, who is fabled to have mauled the invading Danes, even to better purpose than Sir Guy of Warwick \u2014 who, as the story goes, smote the great Colebrand, somewhere in the vale of Chilcombe, while King Athelstan, sitting on a turret of the north wall of Winchester, beheld the progress and issue of the combat \u2014 which is as much a violation of the ordinary principles of optics, as setting the issue of a foray upon the result of a single combat was contrary to the practice of the Danes. But, if there were no \" Giants in the land,\" in those days, there were miracles, or credulity enough to believe so \u2014 which answered the same purpose. We are not so versed in romantic lore, as to be able to say whether Sir Bevois was ever in the same peril from \" horned cattle\" as Sir Guy ; and thus, we refer the curious in such matters to the ancient romances : which, if they have more of mummery, probably have also more of morality than some of the fashionable ones of modern times, \u2014 inasmuch as the exagge ration of imaginary virtues is less injurious than the tale of heartless vice, \" sicklied o'er\" by the malaria of puling sentiment. If Sir Bevois did not decide the fate of the Danes, by hewing down a giant in single combat, he gets the credit of rearing a gigantic mound of earth, to obstruct their passage of the Itchen ; and this is the origin of the name. The literary celebrity of Bevis' Mount arises from its having been the property, and often the residence, of Charles, earl of Peterborough, the friend of the grand triumvirate of the Scriblerus Club ; and it is by no means impossible that, from the bowers or alleys here, (which the earl is said to have laid out with much taste,) at full spring-tide, when the vol. i. u"], [224, "162 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. mud was hidden and the place was in in its glory, Pope may have snapped, Swift sneered, and the more gentle Scriblerus may have sported his wit \u2014 \" circum pr\u00e6cordia ludit,\" \u2014 but at the same time making the most deadly gashes on false philosophy, perverted taste, and hollow virtue, with the keen and often viewless edge of that most matchless instrument. Sotheby was afterwards a dweller here ; and though he may not have caught any of the spangles of the mantle of the trio, he was a sweet poet. With the feelings which are produced by the destruction of the solitude of St. Dennis', one would be in fitting mood to pass to the more stately remains of Netley, which still continue safe from long embankments and trundling wheels, nathless the sward is sorely trodden by pattering feet, the walls blackened by the marks of pic-nic fires, and the manes of the abstemious monks offended by a most unseemly strew ing of corks \u2014 objects which lay under a special anathema in holy halls. But meanwhile we must pause at the ferry. The Itchen Ferry is one of the neatest and most commo dious boat-passages in Europe, across which, carriages, coaches, teams, and all manner of wheeled vehicles, are conducted, without disturbing a buckle of their harness, or an article of their load; riders have no occasion to dismount; and foot-passengers may, if they choose, find shelter in saloons, while all may regale themselves, at the usual cost, with fruits, pastry, and the cooling confections and beve rages which are so grateful to amateur pedestrians, in that sunny season, when such places as Southampton tempt people to forget their cares, renovate their spirits, and turn their complexions to the hue of health, by the fresh zephyrs and delightful prospects of field and flood. Some notion of the general aspect of this ferry and its boat, may be formed by inspecting the plates, only the observer must step a little to his right of the highway, as approaching it in the direction to, not from, the town. In the latter direction there is no view of the boat till one passes the portico, under which the fares are paid, which fares \u2014 one penny per pedes-"], [225, "163 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. trian, and in proportion for those otherwise equipped \u2014 are moderate, considering the ease and safety of the transit and the short time one has to wait for a passage. So short is this time, that though the boat is at the opposite side, it has returned and one can step on board, just upon completing a glance at the conducting chains, and the relay of wheels and pullies. The boat is a broad punt, with the cabins and machinery in the centre, a carriage-way at each side, and a platform at each end, which can be lowered so that a person may walk, or a carriage drive, on board at any state of the tide. The motion is produced by steam. Two wheels, cogged to receive the links of the conducting chains, supply the place of paddles, so that the boat does not in the least agitate the water. The chains are the breadth of the boat apart from each other, firmly moored at the ends, and so adapted in their lengths that, when the boat is at either side, they lie close to the bottom of the mid-channel, and thus do not interfere with the navigation. The only way, indeed, in which they could interfere with that, would be by the fluke of an anchor catching upon them ; and of this there is no danger, as the mooring-ground of the Itchen estuary is too far above for the possibility of any vessel dragging an anchor to this place. The depth at which these chains lie, and the curves which they form \u2014 which cannot differ very greatly from the natural catenary, give great steadiness to the boat, which \" keeps course,\" in all states of wind, tide, and fresh. These chains pass under grooved pullies near the ends of the boat, and over the wheels against the mid-ships, so that the weight keeps the always \"in geer\" upon the wheels. The engine works the wheels with an uniformly steady and not too quick motion, and as the motion of the engine is reversible, the passage is made with equal ease both ways. In order that passengers may not have to wait the return of the boat, very substantial row-boats are always in readiness, belonging to the esta blishment, and unincumbered by any additional charge. Upon the whole, the accommodation which this \" steam bridge\" u 2"], [226, "164 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. affords, for all classes of travellers, pedestrian, equestrian, and vehicular, reflects great credit on the liberality which projected it, the sense which planned it, and the skill which put it in execution. In many respects the improvement of this boat-passage is an advantage ; it opens up a direct communication between Southampton and the country on the left of the river; it gives a direct passage for the coaches between the easterly part of the coast \u2014 Portsmouth and Gosport especially, with the west country, Bath and Bristol, the channel, the valley of the Severn, and the whole of that side of England ; and, even to the most timid visitor of Southampton during the sea-side months, it leads to drives and rambles, which are as delightful as they are new ; and which contrast finely with all that can be enjoyed on the opposite side of the Itchen, much as there is to be enjoyed there ; last, and not least, it affords a shorter and more pleasant passage than could be previously obtained, to Netley Arrey, the finest monastic ruin in the south of England. \"Wind and weather serving,\" the least fatiguing passage \u2014 at least to the limbs, is to take a boat from South ampton harbour to the Netley beach ; but this can be had only when the tide is in. Even then, there is apt to be a little tumbling water where the Itchen estuary meets the main channel ; and a party wishing to return by sea, are of ten in the predicament shown in the fore-ground of Mr. Sar gent's spirited representation of Southampton from the Netley path. The most pleasant walk from the Ferry to Netley is along the beach, which is about two miles in absolute length ; and, the freshness of the sea air and .the brightness of the view, with Calshot Castle appearing like a sea-girt rock, make some amends for the penance of the many loose pebbles upon which one has to plant the somewhat reluctant foot. But the anticipation of pleasure at the end, smoothens the roughest road, and softens the hardest. From Netley, to the village of Hythe on the other side, the Southampton Water is a mile and a half broad ; but this is"], [227, ""], [228, "LOOKING WEST rVmchcusterflttlieihidtbrthcFmpi-irUrJafJlabbms tULye Street iv D.E./sibnow Public Library \u00c6gh I"], [229, "165 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. in the breadth of its beauty only at full flood ; for, at the depth of the ebb, the water narrows to five furlongs, and leaves a dull mud-beach of the same breadth on the Netley shore. Thus, the beach-walk must be timed, in order to be properly enjoyed. Still, there is this comfort: the half-tides are felt even here ; and thus one has not so long to wait as where there are only two returns of tide in the course of the lunar day. In consequence of this, those who visit Netley, and take proper leisure to examine it, are sure to have the benefit of the searriew ; and if this is first seen through between the clumps of trees near the ruins, it appears to the very best advantage. In passing along the beach from Itchen Ferry to Netley, there is nothing very striking to attract attention. The trees are dwarfed by the thinness of the soil, or scathed by the sea air ; the grass upon the inclosures is not rich ; and, though the house which appears on the bank is neat, and in a commanding situation, it has too much the air of a subur ban villa of the middle grade. All this, however, may be well, as preparatory for the real object of the visit ; inasmuch as it gives the benefit of contrast, which is always of use when a sight has to be seen. The first object that shows itself is a modern tower, erected by the lord of the manor upon part of the small fort of Netley castle; but as the embattled walls of the fort itself do not appear till one is in the close vicinity, the modern tower does not attract any attention. In the north side of this little fort, there is a door of more modern and handsome workmanship than one would expect ; and a small sign-board over it intimates that the inhabitant is \" licensed to sell \u2014 tobacco !\" After a long walk by the beach, or on the heath or common, tobacco is but poor fare ; but still the visitant, if so inclined, may have an excellent breakfast upon moderate terms ; and as morning is the time for a contem plative view of the Abbey \u2014 being too early for those persons who come not to study the place \u2014 the accommodation which the fort can afford is a secret worth knowing ; and"], [230, "166 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. he who is weary had perhaps better rest and refresh himself here, \u2014 as a peaceful breakfast in a moated fortalice is not to be had every day. While here, it is as well to con over such notes of the history and description as may be thought necessary ; for Netley Abbey has neither tomb nor inscription, and is, in fact, monumental of nothing but itself \u2014 and even in this it is now faded and imperfect. The etymologists have, as is usual upon such occasions, given themselves no small trouble about the origin of the word Netley ,* and each has been successful in deriving it from his own favourite lan guage; just as Grant of Correimony seriously derived all languages from Gaelic, and Swift ironically did the same from English. Of all things, etymology is one of the most plastic ; for, as there is no material substance in words, they can, as is exemplified every day, be turned about as any one lists without the smallest effort. Unwilling to pass this gentle exercise without a trial, we would suggest \u2014 and any one who is familiar with the old language will feel the suggestion \u2014 that Netley is an altered spelling and pronunciation of a word signifying \" Cow pasture ;\" and the character of the soil, as well as the abbey being built on it, lead us to con clude that this may have been a spot of rich green sward, when most of the vicinity was black heath: it being quite unusual to found abbeys in the desert. As viewed from the beach, or from as near the beach as the ruins can be seen for the trees which are about the fort, or miniature castle, Netley appears to stand on a rising ground ; but it is really in a sort of shell, the ascent of which is very gradual, and the height of the limits not great ; the western parts lie on the slope, and the lowest part of the shell is near the east. Northwards, the level, or' the gradual ascent, is more extensive ; and toward the sea, there is a sort of dell, which contains a garden belonging to the tenant of the castle, and was probably a garden in the monastic times. The area of this dell is limited, and the soil, like most of that around, is fertile rather than rich ; but it is well"], [231, "THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. 167 sheltered from the winds, has a fine exposure to the sea without being open to the sea^winds ; and altogether, it is a spot which would admit of great improvement, and might, by a judicious and by no means expensive application of art, be rendered exceedingly beautiful. It may be, however, that the artificial improvement of which this little dell is susceptible, would spoil the keeping of the whole scene, and dissipate those thoughts which the ruins of an abbey are so well calculated to inspire. To invest such ruins with the garniture of modern art \u2014 entwine the crumbling stones with roses and passion flowers, and prank the area with amarynths and lilies \u2014 would be more out of congruity than converting the turf of the bone-moul dering grave into a bed of flowers. In the latter case, those flowers, in their autumnal decay and their spring revival, are finely emblematical of that resurrection from the dead, of which we have assurance in the word of \" Him who cannot lie ;\" and then, \" the eternal amarynth,\" blooming over the last abode of the mouldering body, glows emble matical of that portion of man which, sublimed above all earthly things, knows neither decay nor death, but shall live in the joy of its hope or the anguish of its despair, through an eternity of ages \u2014 ever new and ever beginning, while suns and systems are created, and wasted, and gather ed to the common mass of matter, the same as those limbs of material clay which sorrowing friends consign to the dust. In the case of human sepulture, we hope in a resurrec tion; and therefore we most appropriately place upon the grave, a flower which shall bloom again after the withering of the appointed season. But, in the case of an abbey, there is no such hope, nor would the hope be a pleasant one if it did exist. Those buildings were stately, no doubt, their cere monies were imposing, their larders were well replenished, and they gave alms to the beggar at the gate: but, what was then the state of the people ; and how did the lamp of science, which shines so clearly in these latter days, and brings to light all the capabilities of nature, and all the"], [232, "168 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. resources of art, \u2014 how dimly did it glimmer in the murky and tainted air of all those mummeries! \"The monks che rished and kept alive that lamp of learning, which otherwise would have been trodden in the dust by the haughty steps of the barons and the reckless hoofs of the boors.\" So they did ; but with them it was not a living light, it was a dark lan thorn, by the help of which they were enabled to come stealthily, and strangle independent thought at its birth, so that they might teach the mindless multitude \u2014 that the inter cession of a saintly tooth or toe-nail, was more acceptable and efficacious in the sight of the Almighty Creator and Governor of the Universe, than a life spent in the most assiduous and successful efforts for advancing the good of his rational creatures, \u2014 by enlarging their capacity of enjoy ment, and increasing the means of its gratification ! Among the more elevated members of the church, there were not wanting, even in the ages of the deepest national darknes, men who maintained the dignity of their nature, high above all baronial \u2014 all kingly pretence : and Wykeham the archi tect, and Beaufort the statesman \u2014 despite the calumny most unjustly thrown upon the latter, are amongst the noblest names of English history. But, whatever the formulary of these men may have been \u2014 and forms must ever follow the fashions of the times, in order that the accompanying sub stance may effect its purpose, \u2014 whatever the formulary of these men may have been, their minds were not monastic. To pass over other illustrious men, whose names adorn the list here and there, Edyngton, Wykeham, Beaufort, and Waynflete, who successively held the see of Winchester for upwards of a hundred and forty years, present a constellation than which there are few more glorious. On account of these reminiscences, as well as for higher and holier reasons, one would wish to see the Cathedral with out a crumbling or disjointed stone. It is not out of nature, and thus it may accord with the spirit of any age, however enlightened. Not so the Abbey.

Yet ought the ruin to be preserved, not as a subject of such puling lamentation as we are apt to hear and read, at and about such places, but as a wholesome me morial of the evil from which we have been delivered. One applauds not the motive or the means which instigated and accomplished the downfal of the monastic institutions ; but these institutions had long been an unseemly excrescence upon the commonweal of the country \u2014 a pernicious growth of \" proud flesh,\" which required the knife and the cautery to be used with no timid and sparing hand. Henry VIII may have been a little rough in his surgery, and he may have cared more for the fee than the patient ; but still, the cure has been wholesome, and we ought to be thankful. Netley Abbey, if not actually built, was certainly sug gested by Peter de Rupibus, La Roche, or Rock, who was made bishop of Winchester in 1204, and held that see till his death in 1233. He was a Frenchman, and a soldier of fortune in his early days ; and as, by his influence with King John, he was enabled to promote many of his country men to places of emolument ; and further, as he recommended that heavy tax upon the English barons which led to the signing of Magna Charta at Runnymede, he was generally hated by the English nation. He retained his influence over Henry III, whose instructor he had been ; but his intrigues led to his voluntary exile in 1227; and so he sought to redeem his popularity, or make amends for the mischief he had occasioned, by serving in the Holy Land. Returning in 1231, he became a zealous founder of monastic establishments, and, among the rest, he suggested the abbey at Netley ; but it is probable that Netley was endowed by Henry at the instigation of Rupibus, and built after the demise of that prelate. After this it received some augmentation from subjects ; but it does not appear to have obtained any farther share of the royal bounty. Indeed, from all that is recorded VOL. I. x"], [236, "170 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. of it, it appears to have attracted little attention, and not to have done much good or much harm. Another establishment projected by Rupibus, the Priory at Selborne, in this county, made a good deal of noise. Wykeham, who appears to have been as zealous for the moral purity as for the architectural grandeur of those religious houses of which he had the super intendence, endeavoured to correct the abuses of the Selborne monks ; but he was by no means successful, even though at one time he was so liberal to them as to pay their debts. Beaufort and Waynflete attempted the same kind of reforma tion in the same priory, but they were not very successful ; and, in the end, Waynflete procured its suppression, and had its revenues transferred to his college of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford. During these attempts at reform, there does not appear to have been any notice taken of Netley ; but whether this silence was more owing to the regularity or the insignificance of the brethren, it is not easy to say. The establishment lingered on till the general suppression by Henry VIII ; at which time the revenues were not very ample, and there was only one book in the library ; so that however quiet the brethren may have been, they were not much given to lite rature. This abbey lasted about three hundred years ; and it does not appear that, during the whole of this period, any one connected with it made the least noise in the public world ; and thus, it is probable that, in the days of its greatest wealth and prosperity, it did not attract so much attention as its ruins do at the present time. Thus, salu brity and beauty of situation, elegance of building, perfect seclusion from the bustling world, and all the other attri butes which are understood to confer so much advantage upon the monastic life, appear to have been most barren of advantage at Netley. With the exception of some six or eight priors whose mere names are mentioned, we are left to infer that the brethren here, who were only thirteen at the time of the dissolution, ate, drank, and died, closing an un profitable life by a death unlamented and unknown. Monu- ,"], [237, "THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. 171 ment or inscription there is none apparent, as the ruins now stand ; and nature has so far triumphed over the fallen roof and tumbled walls which load the floor of the chapel, that the symmetry of the place would be spoiled by clearing these away in order to learn what is beneath. These consi derations, which are peculiar to Netley, taken in conjunction with the more general truths already stated, go far to remove the regret which one might otherwise feel at seeing what has once been so stately a pile so completely in ruins. At the dissolution, Netley was bestowed upon the marquis of Winchester; and in 1560, Queen Elizabeth was enter- tained within its walls, by the then proprietor, the earl of Hertford, \u2014 and this was perhaps the first royal visitation with which it was honoured. It has passed through the hands of many proprietors, by whom its remains have been variously used; and though we know of no miracle being performed while the brethren were there, probably because, like them of St. Dennis', they were deficient in holy bones, yet a kind of one has been \" got up\" respecting the building itself. Taylor, a builder in Southampton, had purchased the materials from the then proprietor ; but he was in conse- quence \" scared by dreams, and terrified by visions.\" The father of Dr. Isaac Watts advised him not to expose himself personally during the demolition ; but he neglected the caution, and was killed by the fall of a stone. The stone must be acquitted of all malice prepense in the matter, and could have been guilty in nothing save its mere gravita- tion ; but, putting every thing like divination out of the question, the man who attempted to pull down these ruins certainly deserved to have his head broken, though not quite to the death, The present lord of the manor, Mr. Chamberlayne, acts more judiciously both by the ruins and the public. No dilapidation takes place ; and nature is left to wanton at will, in every spot where a plant can grow, or a shrub or tree find rooting. Then, there is no barrier to obstruct the public at any one point of all that they have occasion to see ; x 2"], [238, "172 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. neither is there any cicerone to disturb one's contemplations with his cuckoo tale, and hang upon one's rear for his guerdon. These annoyances are too common where sights are to be seen in England ; whence, instead of enjoying your own meditations in peace and quietness, you are obliged to pay for the pain of being annoyed by some senseless and ill-told tale. No doubt, the lord of the manor of Netley has put up notices that those visiting the ruins are not to trample down the crops, injure the woods, or farther delapidate the remains of the abbey ; but that such notices should be neces sary \u2014 and they are found to be in most parts of Britain, is the fault of the visitors, not of the proprietor of the grounds. At Netley there is no scope for trespass, except by such as are wantonly bent upon mischief, and the more smartly that they can be disciplined into orderly conduct the better. With some such preparation as has been faintly sketched, one is in a condition to visit the ruins of Netley, \u2014 ruins which, to be appreciated and enjoyed, must be seen, for they defy alike the pen and the pencil. Netley has been often both said and sung, no doubt ; but the sayings have all been tame. No \" tinkling lyret tuned in ladye bower,\" can come up to the natural air of the place ; and the triple efforts of Keate, Sotheby, and Bowles, have been made all in vain \u2014 they cannot awake the diapason of those moral chords, which sing mournfully to the viewless winds in the sweet desola tion of the place \u2014 when no simpered sentimentality or gig gling sound of unworthy visitor alike jars upon the ear and the feelings. Under such annoyances, the desire of the Bard comes freely and strongly to one's recollection : \u2014 \" Bear me, some god ! O quickly bear me hence.

Even Gray was so far at fault when he represented the hoary shade as performing his \" manual\" devotion for \" the souls of his benefactors interred in the venerable pile ;\" for of the donators to the abbey, Henry III, Edward earl of Corn wall, Robert de Vere, and Walter de Bourg, not a bone is to be found at Netley. No voice from the tomb can fall upon the most willing ear at this spot, \u2014 there is the monument of an abbey, and nothing more. Yet is Netley not the less worthy of a visit, either by the gatherer of scenes or the scatterer of sentiments, for thus standing \" alone in its glory \" \u2014 the greater glory of its ruin. With this feeling the visitor may approach it, and be highly gratified, provoking as it is both to the delineator and the describer. Physically, it stands alone, mantled up in its own grove of trees, and detached by airy little glades from the groves and copses and clumps around. These may claim kindred with the modern park and farm ; but the leafy mantle of Netley is its own : its trees have been arrested by its shelters, in their seeds, adapted to the spots most suited for their growth ; and, stimulated by a more congenial soil than is to be met with around, they have a more free growth, and earlier and greener foliage, than any of those adjacent. Around, within, on the ledge of the wall, on the fallen fragment, or that portion of the vaulted roof which still hangs suspended, \u2014 every where, there is a plant, a bush, or a tree ; and as each is in the situation which its habit chooses, the living mantle of nature is drawn over the ruins of art, and the moss and minute fern triumph over him who fretted the roof and modelled the pillar. The ivy plays its fantastic wreathings, and preaches its curious homily : now it crawls along the ground, a lowly thing to be trodden under foot ; anon, it creeps up the rising bole and the falling pillar, but still retains the crawling leaf, like the forky tongue of serpent \u2014 or sycophant ; but yet a little, and it reaches the summit, overtopping faded tree or ruined wall, and showing a stem of its own ; \u2014 then, the crawling leaf is"], [242, "174 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. seen no more \u2014 the erewhile creeping and dependant ivy stands up in the air of heaven, and in external form it is a laurel. But has it changed its nature % Not a jot : cast it down, and it will crawl as before ; bray it in a mortar, and it will serve as well as ever for depriving little birds of their liberty, and confining the free denizens of heaven's own azure to a brazen dungeon for life. Reader ! dost thou know the world \"? Then thou must have seen the ivy, and mayest spare us the tediousness of the moral : \u2014 The ivy exults over the rotting tree and the ruined wall ; but it mimics no laurel over the living and the tenanted. In the engravings you may see traces of the form of this delightful ruin ; but to feel the spirit you must go thither, and by so doing alone, a pleasure-journey to Southampton is well repaid. It is so mouldered, yet so perfect, \u2014 so secluded, yet so ac cessible, \u2014 so tomb-like, yet so surrounded with life, both of nature and of man, \u2014 that you may muse upon it the weary winter through, and yet find matter for fresh meditation. We shall pause for a moment, to take our look of remem brance alone, and then meet you at the living, and more lively side of the Itchen Ferry, to see what has been done, is doing, or should be done, in and at Southampton. LONDON AND SOUTHAMPTON RAILWAY. The expectations which have been formed of this railway are perhaps different in kind from the effects of which it will really be productive, and perhaps exceed these greatly in amount. But still, the undertaking is magnificent in itself, the execution proceeds rapidly, and the benefit ultimately derived from it by the country through which, and the towns near to which it passes, must be so considerable as to render our notice of the county imperfect without some account of it, unfinished though it be at the time when we write. It is not for us to enter into any inquiry as to how far this railway was at first a mere project, got up for the sake of the fees which are necessarily obtained for the projecting of a joint-stock undertaking, and the carrying through Par-"], [243, "175 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. liament of a bill to warrant its execution, or the profits obtainable by contracts, the salaries of the appointments, or any of the other advantages which individuals have reaped, or in any way may reap, from it. As little shall we enter into any speculation as to what returns the original subscri bers may receive from their shares. These are no doubt the most important questions to the parties interested ; but they are private questions, the solution of which, both in its advantages and its disadvantages, belongs to the individuals themselves, and not to the public, even the local public generally, to which public alone it is our province to address ourselves. If this undertaking, or any other undertaking, is to be a public advantage, it deserves the commendation of those who write for the public, how disastrous soever it may be to the parties by whom it is carried on, or to any portion of those parties ; and, on the other hand, if it is inju rious to the public, it calls for condemnation from those who address themselves to the public, even though it should be in the highest degree profitable to the parties engaged in it. Such are the principles by which we ought to be guided in the few remarks which we have to make on the London and Southampton Railway ; and we shall endeavour to make those remarks as much as possible in the spirit of these principles. The whole length of this railway from the terminus at Southampton to that at London, or in its vicinity, is, in round numbers, about seventy-six miles ; being thus about a mile shorter than the present line of road, passing through Guildsord, Farnham, Alton, and Alresford ; and a mile longer than that passing through Staines and Basingstoke. The remarkable coincidence in length of these three lines of com munication is not a little singular, inasmuch as it shows that, in this district, which is remarkable for its undulated surface, a line approximating very nearly to one very gentle ascent and descent, has been readily found, not much exceed ing in length the established roads, both of which are in some places very hilly, and the Guildsord one remarkably"], [244, "176 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. so, especially in the ascent of the \" Hog's-back,\" which stands up for about seven miles, like the roof of a house, with the road extending along the ridge. As there are three lines of road, leading from London to the principal ports in Hampshire, \u2014 namely, the two already mentioned as uniting at Winchester and leading to Southampton, and the Ports mouth road, which branches to the left at Guildsord, \u2014 it was not possible so to lay down the railroad as that it could be equally available to all the districts of the county. Nature has, however, so adjusted matters as that the line of this communication lying within the county, is rather more than forty-five miles in length, and it forms a diagonal, though, in consequence of its curvature toward the north-west in the middle of its length, it does not divide the surface into two equal parts. In the line of its passage, however, it approaches near the principal towns, and intersects some of the most fertile dis tricts. Its length from Southampton to Winchester is about twelve miles, along which part of its course it follows the line of the Itchen so closely that they are nowhere at any great distance from each other. As already mentioned, and as shown in the view from Bevis' Mount, it passes within the tideway opposite Bitterne for about three furlongs. Thence it keeps the right bank of the river till about three quarters of a mile above Bishop's Stoke, where it again crosses to the left bank for about three furlongs, after which it no more touches directly on the Itchen ; though until where it leaves the river to cross the downs between Head borne Worthy and Weston it is nowhere at any great dis tance from the bank. At Winchester, it approaches within about eight hundred yards of the Cross, in the nearest line with the streets ; and the most appropriate place for a termi nus is not above five hundred yards from the agricultural market in Jewry-Street, \u2014 for the formation of which terminus there are abundant materials, as deep cutting occurs in the chalk both to the north and south, affording enough for this purpose, and to spare."], [245, "FROM BEVOIS MOUNT Winchester. Puhltslted Russell By /' E Gibiwur Public Lthra^u. I g \u25a0\u25a0"], [246, ""], [247, "177 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. For twenty miles on the London side of Winchester, the railroad keeps on the downs, and so touches no place of any consequence ; but at the end of these twenty miles, it passes about half a mile to the northward of Basingstoke, and eight miles before it reaches Basingstoke it approaches within little more than four miles of the market-town of Whit church ; though at that point, or indeed in the greater part of this twenty miles of its length, it meets no road of any great traffic, except the road from Basingstoke to Whitchurch, Andover, and thence to Salisbury, which is the mail-coach road to Pool ; and this it crosses at the village of Worting, about two miles west of Basingstoke. From Basingstoke, the railroad lies in a straight line, east and by north, along the southern face of the heights, for about fifteen miles, unto where it leaves Hampshire, at Farnborough on the bank of the Blackwater. Its total course thus far is, as we have said, about forty five miles, and after this it extends for thirty or thirty-one miles across the county of Surrey, but does not pass through any place of consequence in that county. It cuts off a portion of the park at Oatlands, comes within a mile of the centre of the village of Walton upon Thames, and within half a mile of the centre of Thames Ditton, and of the bank of the Thames a little way to the eastward of that village. It passes Kingston at about a mile to the right in going towards London, and then to the right of Wimbledon Common, and crosses Wandsworth and Battersea-fields to Nine Elms, on the bank of the Thames. A considerable portion of its length is thus without the county of Hants ; but still it is necessary to advert to the nature of the country through which this portion passes before one can form even a correct guess at the probable uses and advantages of the railroad. The part lying in Surrey, and indeed the whole line from Basingstoke to the London extremity, stands very little chance of carrying much goods from the metropolis for the supply of that part of that country, or of carrying much of the produce of the country to the VOL. I. Y"], [248, "178 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. metropolis. In Surrey it passes at a distance from the market towns of Guildsord and Farnham, and in Hants it is equally unconnected with Alton and Alresford ; and even the small town of Odiham is two miles distant on the straight line. Thus, with the exception of the city of Winchester and the town of Basingstoke, this railroad does not, in the course of its whole seventy-six miles, touch closely upon any place where there can be even a local trade to speak of; and, as much of it passes over the downs, where there are few inhabitants, and the cutting is in general so deep as to render it inaccessi ble, except at a few points ; and further, as it generally crosses the valleys, where the people are collected in villages and the principal farm-steadings are chiefly to be met with, upon embankments so raised above the surface as to make the road inaccessible, until the level is gained at which the excavation and the embankment change places with each other, it appears, ex facie, that this railroad, with whatever ability it may be engineered, for shortness of line, easiness of level, and facility of execution, is by no means well adapted for promoting, in any way clearly perceptible to one who looks candidly at the circumstances without any preju dice either for or against the railroad, the general or local interests of that beautifully diversified portion of the country across which it extends. Independently of its distance from the principal towns of the midland part, and of its inaccessibility in those parts where there are no canals, it has to compete with excellent roads throughout the whole line, and with water-carriage, excepting for the twenty miles between Winchester and Basingstoke. The Itchen navigation, though longer in line, and much slower in communication, appears not to have nearly full employment, as the barges are more frequently empty than loaded when they descend the navigation of the Itchen. Thus, it is clear that no wagon-train on the rail way can expect to receive a load of any thing, save human beings, to carry from Winchester to Southampton ; and what else it may bring from Southampton to Winchester is equally"], [249, "179 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. puzzling to find. Granting that a good deal of farm produce is shipped at Southampton, the farmers will still prefer carry ing it thither in their own carts and wagons, as this kind of carriage occurs when both teams and men have the least of any other kind of work to do ; and the return teams can bring a supply of coals, and such other weighty articles of country consumption as are sea-borne, without any additional expense. This, together with the character of the heights across which the railroad passes, and the manner in which it crosses the valleys \u2014 by both of which it is cut off from the ordinary and natural lines of communication in the county, and looks an alien, and, for local purposes, a useless thing \u2014 must necessarily affect the line, in all that portion of its length which lies to the south-west of the summit-level \u2014 that is, which descends from near Basingstoke to the sea at Southampton. Thus it appears pretty evident that, of the produce of Hampshire south-west of the summit, as the county is at present cultivated, little or none will be carried toward Southampton ; and it would be ascribing too much to a mere line of conveyance, especially one which, as we have said, is detached from the ordinary roads of the country, and quite unfit for being used for common carriages or for horses, could to any extent alter the produce of the land, or change the occupations of the people. We have repeatedly had occasion to notice that, since Winchester ceased to have a metropolitan character, and especially since steam took the lead of all other powers used in manufacture, the manu factures of Hampshire have dwindled almost to nothing, and the county has assumed what may be called its natural state, that of a rich and beautiful agricultural district. This has been attended with, or followed by, a falling off in the population and wealth of such of the towns as were formerly in great part supported by the manufactures then established in them. But this must be regarded as a wholesome falling off \u2014 an exfoliation or sloughing of the diseased parts, and5 as such, an indication of general healing. It is the artificial y2"], [250, "180 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. power \u2014 or rather coal, the grand element in the obtaining of this power, together with the proximity of a general market, which can alone support manufactures ; and even with this, the manufacturing districts are subject to great fluctuations, and distresses of the operatives ; which circumstances, though inseparable from extensive manufacturing, are very painful to contemplate, both in respect of humanity and of morals. In Hampshire, owing to physical circumstances, which no human ingenuity or skill can change, such a state of things is not practicable, and though it were it would not be desirable. If, therefore, this has been one of the proposed results of the railroad, whether as believed by the projectors, or simply resorted to as a means of procuring purchasers of the shares, it is equally conclusive of their want of knowledge in the one respect, or of principle in the other. In this we allude to no individual : we praise or find fault with no party ; but as the describers of Hampshire we have a public duty to perform, \u2014 we wish fairly and to the best of our ability, to set forth the county as it actually is ; and from this duty we will not shrink, let whosoever stand in the way of the perform ance of it. It does not appear that the portion of the railway to the eastward of the summit-level will be more serviceable in the way of local accommodation \u2014 or that such accommodation is very urgently required. Surrey, like Hants, is equally famed for the number and the excellence of its roads ; and, then, the railroad will have to contend, in the conveyance of heavy goods, with the Basingstoke canal, and the navigations of the Thames, and its affluent, the Wey. These, as well as the roads, are adapted to the towns and more populous parts of the country as they now exist ; and as the people do not require to be supplied with weighty articles of consumption at post-haste, there is every probability that water-carriage will still be preferred for them ; and the farmers will, of course, continue to employ their own teams for short dis tances. Therefore, we must conclude that, whatever other purposes"], [251, "181 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. this railroad may answer, it is not adapted to the present state and localities of either of the two counties through which it passes, nor is it easy to anticipate any change which will render it locally more useful in time coming. The county is, in its very nature, agricultural, and agricultural only ; and this character it has been assuming more and more exclusively, during the very time when manufactures have been making their most rapid advances, and naturally set tling down in those places which are best suited for them, in materials, in power, in facilities for the market, and in every thing else. Such having been the case, without any special calamity falling upon the manufactures in this part of England, and its being still going on, until even the last lingering, manufacture \u2014 that of paper, for which the pure water of the south-running rivers of Hampshire is peculiarly fitted, and also affords sufficient power for paper-making machinery, \u2014 until even this has dwindled to a mere fragment. With such experience before us \u2014 a perfectly natural experi ence as we may truly call it, it would be absurd to hope that manufactures would again revive in the county from the mere circumstance of a railroad passing through it \u2014 more especially as this railroad passes close by very few of the places where manufactures were formerly established. In ad dition to this, it must be borne in mind that, throughout the whole west of England \u2014 as it is termed, the manufactures, especially the staple manufacture of woollen cloths, are in a state of gradual decay, which decay is increasing from year to year, without any probability of a revival. When we find manufactures or commerce declining in one place, and establishing themselves in another, at a time when upon the whole they are on the increase, we may be sure that the changes arise from adequate causes ; and that, how much soever the inhabitants of those places where the manufactures decline may regret that circumstance, the change is for the general good of the whole country, and that they will obtain their share of it in due time. The inhabitants of a place or district, do not always understand"], [252, "182 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. its physical circumstances, so as to be able to abandon those pursuits which are carried on at a disadvantage, and follow only the advantageous ones ; but, when matters are in a flourishing state, the people of one place teach this wisdom to those of another \u2014 and that to their cost, if they will not learn otherwise. The inhabitants of Hampshire have been taught this lesson, slowly but surely ; and they are too wise in this their purchased experience, for departing from that cultivation of the soil which is their natural and proper employment, and the only one in which they can advan tageously engage. Now, in an agricultural country, and for agricultural purposes, a railroad, so far from being wanted, is completely out of place. Even though the whole disposable produce of the Hampshire farms were concentrated to one great mart \u2014 say London for instance, the expense of carrying it to the stations on the railway would be as great to the farmer, as that which at present enables him to carry it to the market, the miller, or the maltster ; and he never could afford to pay for carriage on a railroad in addition to this. Say that five quarters of wheat average a ton ; this ton, according to the rates of wagonage, which competition has brought down to not more than a fair remunerating price, would cost about ten shillings a quarter for the transfer \u2014 an expense which the farmer neither would nor could pay. But the railroad could not afford to carry for less than this, and probably not for so little. There is no productive power in a railroad. It is a mechanical contrivance for saving time, and the time so saved must be paid for. Except as between manufactory or port on the one hand, and market on the other, and where the quantity is great and the trans fer constant, a railroad cannot be a cheaper means of transit than a common road. This railroad will not form an excep tion. Before it is finished, and the trains in working order, the cost will be found not much short of three millions, and the wear and tear, and expenses, will not be less than three hundred thousand a-year, if it is to afford the same frequency"], [253, "183 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. of transit, as the conveyances by the ordinary roads. Take the burdens carried, in quarters of wheat, or in passengers, at ten shillings each, and six hundred thousand in the year are required to cover the expenses and repairs. This is for the whole line ; but half the line is the fair estimate, and for this the annual number of persons, of quarters, or of other articles paying at the same rate, would need to be one million, two hundred thousand, \u2014 equal to a visit once a year by the whole inhabitants of London and its vicinity ! It is probable that, if the trains are once in full play, the people along the line of the road may send fruit, vegetables, and other articles of provision to the London market ; but it will require some time before they get into the habit of growing these ; nor will the number of sheep and cattle sent along the line be very great, at least until the markets change much from their present localities. Hampshire has no prominent article of export ; and it is not much of a grazing county ; for even Winchester is, in great part, supplied from the Salisbury market. It is, to perhaps a greater extent than any other county of England, what may be called a home-county, or self-supporting county. Scarcely any arti cles are brought into it, except necessaries for immediate consumption, and little else is sent out of it than serves to pay the price of these, on a fair and equitable system of reciprocity. Such being the case, and the chief occupations being agricultural, it is not practicable, neither would it be desirable though it were, that either the people or the busi ness should be concentrated into large masses \u2014 masses for which alone a railroad, or any other great and exclusive means of conveyance, could be rendered available to advan tage. In such a county, the whole surface may be regarded as the locus of its most profitable manufacture ; and there fore, its great thoroughfares require to be such as that their ramifications may be extended to every farm-yard, and indeed to every arable field ; and, with a railroad, this is out of the question. As regards the county therefore, the London and Southampton railway must be regarded as little"], [254, "184 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. else than \u2014 a certain kind of demonstration on the face of the earth. There is, however, one little consideration which is impor tant to landlords, to farmers, and to all who are interested in the local welfare and prosperity of the county : \u2014 It is the interest of all, that the high-roads should be kept in the best possible condition at the least possible local expense ; and, in as far as the railroad may obtain a share of what may be called the long carriage on these roads \u2014 the short carriage it never can obtain, in so far it will tend to make the high roads either worse, or locally more expensive. Now there is nothing so essential to the profitable working of an agri cultural country as good roads crossing it in all directions, with as few turnpike-gates and as light tolls as possible ; and, if the county were to suffer in this way from the rail road, it would sustain an injury for which that road could make no amends whatever. There is another consideration, closely connected with this one ; and that is the tendency which the railroad must, in proportion to the share of the present traffic which it draws, have to diminish the number of horses. Besides their value for draught or for the saddle, there is a special agricultural advantage in horses ; for, up to a certain amount, the number of them which is kept, increases instead of dimi nishes the production of human food. So much is this the case that, if the number of horses now employed was to be greatly reduced, the fertility of the soil would soon fall off \u2014 as has been the case in Poland and other places, which were drained of their horses and other agricultural live-stock during the wars. It is mainly from the number of horses kept in London, for the purpose of travelling, and trade, and pleasure, that London is so well supplied with culinary vege tables and garden fruits ; and if the whole carriage of goods were to be effected by means of steam-carriages upon rail ways, the metropolis would soon feel the consequences in quantity, quality, and price \u2014 and that to a much greater extent than those who have not studied the relative and reciprocal"], [255, "185 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. workings of the different parts of our domestic economy would be apt to suppose. The remarks now made, apply in part to all railways passing through extensive agricultural districts; and, as the whole line ofthe London and Southampton Railway may be said to lie along such a district, they are peculiarly applicable to it. The countervailing advantages remain to be stated \u2014 to be discovered indeed, for there is no railroad any way similar to this, in so forward a state as to make its advantages any thing but mere speculations, founded on hypotheses, and therefore deceptive or not, as the event may turn out. This may appear but a sorry ground upon which to have expended such vast sums of money as these projects have already cost; but there is a fashion in speculation, as well as in every thing else ; and the fashion is irresistible while it lasts, though it may appear ridiculous or absurd as soon as it has given place to a new one. The only portion of trade upon this railway, from which either public advantage, or a fraction of a return to the proprietors can be expected, is the bring ing of Southampton within half its present distance to London in the case of passengers ; and within much less in that of goods ; and as this is connected with Southampton as a town and port, rather than with Hampshire as a county, it can be adverted to with more advantage after we have given such brief notice of these as our space will admit. It is of course to be understood, that the remarks which we have made upon the railway in this section, are founded entirely upon the physical characters ofthe counties through which that railway passes ; upon the present occupation ofthe people of Hampshire and the inland or western part of Surrey, which like Hampshire is almost exclusively agricul tural ; and upon the present nature and extent of the trade of the Port of Southampton, which, with the exception of travellers and their luggage \u2014 the number whereof is both considerable and increasing, consists of little else than coal, timber, and such other necessaries for the consumption of vol. i. *Y"], [256, "186 THE SOUTHAMPTON DISTRICT. the surrounding district as are most advantageously brought by sea. We have taken a first view of this line of commu nication, upon these data only ; because they are the really existing ones, \u2014 the ones which are apparent to every ob server; and therefore many, both residents and strangers, will naturally form their own conclusions from them only. We are perfectly aware, however, that while we are doing this, we are only putting half the case ; and that this conclu sion is not perfectly correct as to the whole anticipated ad vantages of the railway. But still, what we have stated are the proper data, whereby to judge of the work itself, without reference to other matters. For the anticipation part, we must call in the assistance of other elements ; and as those elements will require an induction of various cir cumstances connected with the history of the trade of South ampton, and also with the physical characters of the South ampton water, and the nature of the navigation between London and the grand anchorage of Spithead; and, of these, in addition to the situation, and a few other circumstances connected with the Borough of Southampton, we shall take some notice in the next chapter."], [257, ""], [258, "Winchester.

Although Southampton cannot boast of the same antiquity, the same memory of regal, and the same continuance of episcopal splendour, as Winchester, yet it is a place of much interest, and much activity ; and, notwithstanding that the grand depot for the Royal Navy of Britain is at Portsmouth, Southampton is perhaps the most stirring town within the county, and the one in which both buildings and inhabitants are most upon the increase. It owes much to the beauty of its situation ; the safety of its road-stead and harbour ; and the circumstance of the whole sea-borne supply of the valleys of the Itchen and Test \u2014 the latter extending almost to the extreme north of the county and ramifying as far to the westward as Salisbury \u2014 being in a great measure concentrat ed upon it. The maritime jurisdiction of the Port of South ampton is very extensive \u2014 reaching from Southsea castle, on the east of the entrance of Portsmouth harbour, all round the shores of the Southampton water, and the Solent, to Hurst Castle, where the mainland approaches nearest to the Isle of Wight, and out to the mid-channel toward that island, \u2014 the mayor being admiral of the coast. This line is about fifty miles in length, exclusive of the smaller estuaries ancl creeks ; and these, taken at all their ramifications, * y2"], [260, "188 SOUTHAMPTON. amount to at least half as much more. Inland, the officers of the corporation have jurisdiction over the whole of the old county, or present parliamentary liberty, independently of the lord lieutenant and sheriff of Hampshire. This im- portance by sea and land, gives the local authorities of Southampton a certain degree of consequence ; and probably gives a tone to the character of the inhabitants \u2014 who have more speculation and enterprise than those of most other places in the county ; and this, though not of course attended with invariable success, has been productive of many im provements, and is the cause of speedy recovery from disas ters. This is no new feature in the character of the inhabi tants ; for we find traces of it even in the slightest sketch of the HISTORY OF SOUTHAMPTON. There is no record of any town existing, in the time of the Romans, where Southampton now stands, nor can we know, with any thing like certainty, the early condition of the ground which it occupies. The fortified or ancient portion, forming the western part of the peninsula, is a hard, or ele- vated bank of gravel, which probably was then barren. The eastern part, from the old walls to the Itchen Ferry, and so onward toward Northam, as far as the ground is level, was probably covered with water by every tide, as a portion retains the name of the Marsh, and is still partly below the high-water of spring tides. Under these circumstances there was very little inducement to form a settlement here ; and for this reason, the Romans had their harbour at Clausentum. It is, however, by no means improbable that a village, or station of some kind, was situated at Northam ; and it may be possible, and not unlikely, that, when a fortified post was established on the Hard, the epithet South might be applied to it, in contradistinction to the name of this more ancient village. The first account of it which occurs in the chronicles is a notice of its being pillaged by the Danes, in 873, or forty-"], [261, ""], [262, "FROM 2VETLEY BEACH. Winchester. Published tor the Proprietor. Ja.. 'Bobbins. tbUeye Street . mmm i, i -By 1>E Gibnour. Public library . High, Street ."], [263, "189 SOUTHAMPTON. six years after the union of the Heptarchy under Egbert ; and as the Danes landed on this part of the coast soon after his coronation at Winchester, and as no notice is taken of any attack upon Southampton previous to his death in 837, it is probable that Southampton was founded in the interval, and perhaps by Alfred,\u2014 as, in the early part of the reign of Ethelbald, the Danes landed at Southampton, and proceeded to Winchester, which they took and pillaged ; but no notice is taken of any pillage of Southampton, until 873 as above stated. The probability therefore is, that it was an out post, for which it is well situated, as commanding the whole Southampton water, and also the valley of the Itchen, which was the grand object of the plundering invaders, from the wealth both of the king and the church, then the chief wealth of the country, being kept at Winchester. What kind of fortification was then erected, or what particular spot of the area subsequently enclosed by the walls it occu pied, are however matters of mere antiquarian conjecture. After the first mention is made of it, it was pillaged again and again by the Danes, in the short period of ten years, which shows that the invaders looked upon it as a place of importance if not of wealth; and, from the speedy repair and probable strengthening of its fortifications, the Saxons themselves appeared to have viewed it in the same light. This state of things continued with various intermissions ; and, about the end of the tenth century, Southampton was the head-quarters of the Danes ; nor was it until the accession of Canute had put an end to the horrors of these invasions, that this scene of many early wars and pillages began to have a little respite. Canute appears to have been fond of South- ampton ; and it is here that the chroniclers fix the locality of his well known reproof to the courtiers by showing that the sea would not obey his royal command, \u2014 after which he suspended his crown over the altar in Winchester, as a votive acknowledgment of Him by whom kings reign. From this time, Southampton appears to have enjoyed comparative tranquillity and prosperity ; and it is probable"], [264, "190 SOUTHAMPTON. that several of the churches were founded and endowed by the kings of that period, though the particulars are not spe cially recorded. It is very likely that Northam and all the places without the fortifications were destroyed during the contest alluded to ; and therefore we find Hantune as the name in Domesday Book, which leads to the conclusion that there was then no other place deserving the name of a town, upon the shores of the Ant, Anton, or Southampton Water. The Norman conquest, though it was productive of much fighting and a good deal of oppression, was a conquest for possession, and not an inroad for plunder like those of the Danes ; and thus it does not appear to have retarded the increasing growth of Southampton. On the contrary, the monarchs paid particular attention to this town. Henry I is understood to have erected it into a borough; and Henry II to have confirmed its privileges both as a borough and a port. John was among its greatest kingly benefactors ; for he erected the liberty into a county, and extended the privileges of the port so as to include Portsmouth. From this time, to about the middle of the fourteenth century, it continued to extend and flourish ; but it then met with a sad reverse, being taken and pillaged, the greater part of the houses burned, and the people butch ered, by the French and their allies. But its importance caused it to be speedily re-built ; and it appears to have been strongly fortified, as the French failed in an attempt upon it in the early part of the reign of Richard II. Henry IV conferred some favours upon it; and it was from its port that Henry V sailed with the army which gained the battle of Agincourt ; and here also that the conspiracy against his life was detected, and the earl of Cambridge, Lord Scrope, and Sir Thomas Grey, executed for the same. The ancient progress of Southampton, from a gravelly point to a fortified station, and from that to a port of the first class \u2014 which it was in those days, was intimately con-"], [265, "191 SOUTHAMPTON. nected with the then state of Winchester. The prosperity of both, considered in a commercial point of view, was not indigenous, arising from those physical capabilities which cannot be changed in the course of time, but arose from the presence of the court, and the vast numbers and great wealth of the religious establishments. As these increased in extent and splendour, the resort of foreign merchants to the port of Southampton increased in the same ratio. Wines, silks, rich embroideries, and various other articles of luxury, were imported, chiefly from Genoa, and the other mercantile cities in Italy ; and the principal article of export in return was wool \u2014 the staple for which was at Winchester, and next to wool, tin from the Cornish mines. The great article of import appears, however, to have been wine, for which Win chester in the olden time is celebrated in the doggrel rhymes of the monkish chroniclers. For some time, Southampton had a monopoly of this article, and also of several others, by which merchant-vessels were prohibited from discharging or receiving certain cargoes at any British port, without having paid a previous duty at Southampton. It is said that, in the fourteenth century, a Genoese merchant brought forward a project for rendering Southampton one of the principal ports of Europe. What this project may have been has not been divulged, but the probability is, that it was of the restrictive kind. It was not carried into execu tion, and the merchants of London stand accused, we know not with what truth, of procuring the assassination of the projector ; but early in the fifteenth century, Henry IV broke down the monopoly, by allowing the produce and manufac tures of Italy to be imported at London. After this, the trade of Southampton declined rapidly ; and the prohibition of the export of wool may be said to have completed its decline ; though the fact of its being for so long a time the principal port to which this article was brought to be shipped, most likely led to the first establishment of the woollen manufactories in the west of England. The decline of the town and trade was gradual ; and"], [266, "192 SOUTHAMPTON. about the middle of the sixteenth century, a proposal was made, and approved of by Edward VI, for establishing Hull as a free port for the trade of the north of Europe, and Southampton as the same for the south ; but this was not carried into execution. About this time, there were upwards of two thousand tons of shipping belonging to the port ; though it had lost all the advantages of its monopoly ; and by the withdrawal of the court, and the suppression of the monastic institutions, Winchester was reduced to a small portion of what it had once been as a market for the goods landed at Southampton. The trade might have continued to fluctuate for a considerable time, as there were many rich merchants in the place. But the great plague in 1665 drove them from the town ; and as they never returned, the foreign trade was almost annihilated, and the imports confined to local supply, which it has, with little exception, been ever since: \u2014 and, the recent increase and improvement of the town, have chiefly resulted from the increasing demand of the district to which it is the natural port. Our limits forbid us entering more at large into particu lars ; but the slight outline which we have given will fur nish some data for the solution of a question much agitated at present, namely, whether Southampton shall again be made a place of extensive import and export, as the Channel out-port to the great metropolitan mart of London. This is closely connected with the point which we reserved in taking a glance at the railway, in the concluding section of the last chapter \u2014 the transit of goods both ways, the whole length of the line, without reference to the local supply of the country through which that line passes ; and on this we shall offer a few words, before taking our topographical glance at the town. PORT OF SOUTHAMPTON. We have already spoken of the extent, beauty, and safety of the Southampton water, and of the number and conve nience of several of its creeks, so that we may now confine"], [267, ""], [268, "\\ jVJ pis \u2022 \u2022 -.s.follcye Street .JfyH.i liic S.urun."], [269, "193 SOUTHAMPTON. ourselves to the harbour, and its accommodations, present or in project. It is at present wholly a tide-harbour, with its main line of quay convex toward the sea, and the pro jecting piers toward the middle of the curve. There are two of them : the old pier, near the termination of the High Street; and the Royal pier, about 180 yards farther west, and projecting rather more than a furlong from the quay. The extremity of this pier, which has an enlargement bend ing to the east, is allotted to the steam-craft ; and, from the ex tent to which it is carried, there is water to float such craft, at all times of the tide. This pier is chiefly constructed of timber. The old pier, and the Town quay between it and the wooden pier, are the principal places for the ship ment and landing of goods ; but there is an extension of the quay westward, with some angles and jetties, The tide ebbs back about a furlong from the town quay, and more from the quay and sea-wall to the eastward and westward. The harbour is thus completely exposed ; and as the rise of tide is only fifteen feet at spring flood, and ten or eleven on the average, no vessel of any great draught of water can come to the quay ; but though exposed, there is not much violence in this land-locked estuary ; the anchorage in the offing is good, with nearly four fathoms at spring-ebb ; and the tidal bottom by the quay is level, and not liable to break the back of a loaded vessel, or very greatly to strain the timbers. Thus, as a tide harbour for small craft, the port of South ampton is both commodious and safe ; neither are there any very serious hazards in the channel ; for the clear-way within the buoys is about three-quarters of a mile ; and the banks are of an adhesive nature, and not liable to shift. There is also not much silting up, except in particular eddies, as the waters of the principal rivers, filtered as they are by the irrigation of the water meadows in the valleys, bring down very little sediment ; and they meet the tide too gently for causing much disturbance of the bottom. Still, there are all the disadvantages of a tide harbour, in consequence of which VOL. I. aa"], [270, "194 SOUTHAMPTON. a very great trade cannot be carried on, without much incon venience and loss of time, as compared with places where there are docks, in which vessels ride afloat at all times, and are always accessible for loading or unloading. To remedy these defects, it is proposed, and an act of parliament has been obtained for the enclosing.of about 210 acres, seaward of the present sea-wall, beginning about 500 yards east of the Royal pier, extending about 600 yards to seaward in the direction of that pier ; at its eastern boun dary, stretching about 1200 yards south from the west land ing of the Itchen Ferry ; and the southern side, which is to be convex to the sea, measuring upwards of 1000 yards. In this 210 acres, it is proposed to form four docks, of about fourteen acres in surface each, and each with a birth age of about five furlongs clear of the gates, making in all about two miles and a half of birthage for a single tier of ships, which would afford ample accommodation for a very large trade, with upwards of 140 acres of the made ground for wharfs, warehouses, and all other requisites Three of the docks are intended to open from the channel of the Itchen, with eighteen feet water at spring-ebb, and thirty-three at spring-flood ; and one dock is to enter from the channel of the Southampton Harbour, where there is the same rise of tides, but only fourteen feet at spring-ebb. The entrance to this western dock is to be immediately from the tide-way, by a lock with double gates ; but the three eastern ones are to consist of a receiving dock and two inner docks, the former entering by double gates from the channel of the Itchen, and the other two from this one by the same means. That this is a most splendid project, no one can deny ; and if these docks, with the requisite graving-docks, ware houses, building-yards, and other appurtenances, were once finished, and in full play, there is no doubt that Southamp ton Would be one* of the finest ports in the empire. But the expense will be very great \u2014 greater than the projectors, or their engineer, seem to be aware of. The capital of the"], [271, "195 SOUTHAMPTON. Company is stated at 350,000/., of which 300,000/. is cal culated as the expense of inclosing the ground, and com pleting one of the docks. We are not in possession of all the data, which are not easily found in a work of this kind \u2014 as many of them are latent, and discoverable only by expe rience ; but we are inclined to conclude, from some practical knowledge of matters of a similar description that the cost of even this much of the* substantial execution will considerably exceed the estimate. Still, we shall suppose that the requi site funds, whatever these may be, can be raised upon the present seven thousand 50/. shares, or upon any number of new shares that may be necessary ; and farther, we shall suppose that all the works are completed ; and then there can be no question that Southampton will be in possession of a most splendid and inviting harbour. In addition to this, we shall suppose, that the railway is completed, and the trains thereupon in full operation, or ready for operation ; and then, but not till then, we are in a proper condition for entering upon the question as to whether Southampton shall be the outport of London for the southern trade, and save all the expense of the navigation from Spithead to London. That this would be attended with many advantages, is certain ; for the navigation round the coast of Kent and up the Thames, is the most uncertain, tedious, and dangerous, of any part of a southern voyage. The difficulties and dan gers of it are also of a nature which no art of man can remove or lessen ; so that there is no resource but to get intimately acquainted with them, and avoid them with the most watchful care. The peculiar action of the sea, and the results of that action, are the grand physical difficulties of this navigation. It is here that the North Sea tide and the Channel tide meet each other ; and both of them are peculiar tides. The tide from the North Sea sets along the British coast ; and, unless in strong winds from the north-west blowing the whole length from the Northern Ocean, it does not round the South Foreland, but is extinguished about Deal. The Channel aa 2"], [272, "196 SOUTHAMPTON. tide rolls eastward, as through a funnel, on account both of the shores and the bottom. The general width lessens east ward, but by very irregular lines, so that the tide-waves form very curious courses, all convex eastward ; but they are so laid hold of by the projecting head-lands, especially the Li zard, Start Point, and the Isle of Wight, that to the eastward of these, they set directly in-shore. A portion of what may be called the tails of these tide-waves, is dropped in the bays, so that a second high-water falls upon the ebb of every principal tide ; and produces double tides in the half day, \u2014 as in the harbours of Pool and Christchurch, and the South ampton Water. From an hour and a half to two hours, is the time of flow of the second tide ; and it begins about as long after the principal one has began to ebb. This is a great advantage in working into these harbours ; for if a vessel cannot make her port before the turn of the principal tide, she has only to wait a short time, and make it on the secondary or dropped tide. This advantage arises from the tide setting directly into the funnel-shaped tide-way ; and no other part of the coasts of Britain has the same advantage. It will be understood that this second tide is a follower, not an opponent, of the principal one ; and thus it has no ten dency to produce broken water, or a current, or any other danger to the mariner. The bottom, or bed of the Channel, also tends to retard the free motions of the tide-waves, and thus increase the agitation of the water, and consequently the danger of the navigation eastward. There are sixty fathoms water be tween the Scilly Isles and Ushant ; fifty off the Lizard ; forty off Start Point ; and the same onward to Beachy Head, a little to the west of which it shoals to thirty fathoms ; and between that and Dungeness, it shoals to twenty fathoms. If therefore, the length of the Channel is supposed to be di vided into three parts, the entrance part rises a third of its depth towards the east, the middle lies on a level, and the eastern part rises eastwards one half of the previous depth. There are thus a pool and two rapids, so to speak ; and"], [273, "197 SOUTHAMPTON. Southampton has the advantage of lying against the middle of the pool, as well as of the double tide, the shelter of the land, and the Spithead Channel and the Solent \u2014 as means of communication with the main Channel, by which an en trance may be gained in almost any state of the wind. Thus, there is perhaps no harbour in the world upon which more physical advantages are concentrated than the harbour of Southampton ; and although the causes of them were not known at the time, there is no doubt that they attracted the Belg\u00e6, and led to the comparative civilisation of the adjoin ing county, in very early times. The Southampton Water is thus the \" father\" harbour of England ; and as the sea has been, and continues to be, the main source of our great ness and wealth, we owe a debt of gratitude to this harbour, independently of all personal and pecuniary considerations. After the struggle which the tidal wave has to make in the entrance of the Channel, and its pause, comparative tranquillity, and double tides in the bays, when it gets with in the Bill of Portland, and Cape la Hogue, it has a still greater struggle to encounter as it enters Dover. The bottom is not only shallowed there to one-third of what it is at the entrance from the Atlantic, and the breadth contracted to about a fifth of that between the Land's End and the opposite point of France, but there is an enemy to meet \u2014 the oppo sing tide from the north. It is true that, at the point of meeting, the north tide is the weaker one, as being farther from the main tide of the Atlantic ; and thus the Channel tide has its main set along the continental shore, where it gradually weakens towards the coast of Jutland. But at first, it lets fall an eddy against the north tide, beginning about the South Foreland ; and the slack of this eddy has formed the banks there, while the strength of it renders the navigation dangerous and impracticable, in winds which are fair every where else. It is this which renders the passage, especially the outward passage \u2014 though the inward one is bad enough \u2014 so disagreeable, so uncertain, and so dangerous, to all sailing vessels, from the Thames to the Channel."], [274, "198 SOUTHAMPTON. Then, the navigation of the Thames itself is long, intricate, and expensive, and it is crowded with vessels ; so that, taking all things into consideration, the passage between the grand anchorage at Spithead and the port of London, is more trou blesome, more uncertain, and more expensive, both on account of the habitual wear and tear, and the frequent shipwrecks, than any other, of double or triple the length, that could be named. These are the general objections to London, as the general port for vessels navigating the Channel ; and they are physical objections, which skill may in part avoid ; but which no art and no labour can remove, or even diminish. Now, if we as before, take the anchorage at Spithead \u2014 the grand asylum for all vessels navigating the Channel, \u2014 if we take it as the starting point, and compare the passage thence to Southampton with the passage round the Forelands, we cannot fail to perceive the natural advantages of South ampton. It is not one-twelfth part of the distance, being rather less than twenty miles ; it is as straight as an arrow ; it is so sheltered as to be available in every wind \u2014 except ex treme cases, when no vessel can keep the sea, so near to land; and it has no disturbing current, no rock, no hazard of any kind ; and thus may be made without almost any ex pense of pilotage. If it could be made the general port of the whole south trade of England with all countries, the saving would be immense, in time, in expenses, in destruc tion of property, and in loss of life, \u2014 so great, indeed that it would remove from our commerce one of the heaviest dead weights by which it is pressed down; and save to the whole nation, in a very short time, as much in actual money value, to say nothing of the vexation, anxiety, and sorrow, as would pay the cost of the projected docks at Southampton, and the railway from thence to London, many times over. Therefore, in this view of their project, and it is the pro per and legitimate view, the projectors of the docks and rail way \u2014 they are both parts of one and the same project, the one of which would be of little avail without the other \u2014 deserve the highest commendations from the public. We"], [275, "199 SOUTHAMPTON. have already expressed our opinion of the inapplicability of the railway to the agricultural district through which it passes ; and had there been nothing save that, and the faci lity which it will afford to the great number of tourists and travellers, who pass through Southampton \u2014 and the number of whom the railway will no doubt very much increase \u2014 we should have no hesitation in saying that a mountain had been made to labour in order that a mouse might be born. But, when we look at the Compound project, and look at it in this light, we come to a conclusion very different indeed. As in all joint-stock projects, the projectors, no doubt, had regard to their own interest ; but their scheme involves a higher interest \u2014 higher even than any local improvement that can be named. Accomplish this project, \u2014 finish these works, and put them in full operation, and a benefit will thereby be conferred upon every commercial nation upon the face of the earth. Of the patriotic intention, as well as the splendid nature of this compound project of dock and railway, there cannot therefore be one question, or a single doubt. It is equally obvious that, if a considerable portion of the shipping, now passing round Kent to and from the Thames, were to stop at Southampton, deliver its cargoes there, send them up by the railway, and receive return cargoes by the same means, a great influx of population and wealth, and a general stimu lus to activity and industry of all kinds would be given '; and that the agricultural interest, both proprietors and farm ers, would soon feel the advantage. The vessels would, as a matter of course, be repaired at Southampton ; and many would be built there. .This would create a demand for timber, of which there is abundance, and much of it well adapted for ship-building, in size, in form, and in quality. Then the victualling of the ships, and the maintenance of all the parties necessary for carrying on the business of the harbour and the transit, would occasion a great and con stant demand for all descriptions of farm and garden produce, which would give a general rousing to the energy of the cui-"], [276, "200 SOUTHAMPTON. tivators, increase the productiveness of the county, and the wealth and comfort of all classes of the people, while in creased intelligence and elevation of character would be the necessary and certain results. In short, this is the only scheme, the execution and suc cess of which could be of great and general benefit to Hamp shire ; for it is the only one that could address itself imme diately to the grand natural resource of the county \u2014 the productiveness of the soil ; and, fully carried out, it would do this very largely and most beneficially. Therefore, all the inhabitants of Hants have a deep inte rest in the success of the docks and railway jointly ; and not Hants only, but the people of all the Channel counties, and as far inland as the great southern water-shed, which separates the Channel country from the valleys of the Thames and its affluents. If these works shall be completed, and the whole come into full operation, people will begin to wonder why there was not a general port upon the Channel coast many years ago. It is the most proximate coast, to all the south of Europe, to Africa, to Asia, to Australia, and to America \u2014 even the northern parts. There is sometimes a little difficulty in getting out of the Channel into the Atlan tic ; but this is nothing, either in frequency or in danger, to the passage from the Channel to the Thames. There are no rocks, banks, or other obstructions ; the mid-channel tide sets directly to the east ; and, the curvatures of the waves of tide toward the shores, together with the dropped or half tides, render a tidal approach to the land a very easy matter, and, generally speaking, most easy at those places where a landing is most desirable, either for temporary security or for trade. With such prospects of the capabilities of the place and the scheme, not drawn from speculation, but founded upon physical truths, which are well known to all who have re flected upon the subject, and which may be verified by any one at a first examination, there is no reason to doubt that funds will be obtained for the carrying on and completion of"], [277, "201 SOUTHAMPTON. the works ; and, though there is no disguising the fact that these works, properly executed, will be very costly ; yet there does not appear to be any of those unseen or indeter minate hazards about them, which cannot be calculated. On the coasts of Kent, and other places where the sea is, and has been for a number of years, invading and wearing away the land, the construction of so extensive a marine work as the sea-wall at the Southampton docks is proposed to be, would be a very serious matter. When, in consequence of changes which we can neither controul nor understand, old Neptune begins to thunder upon the cliffs, and batter them down with their own ruins, man cannot build against him with impunity ; and if half the money which has been ex pended near the entrance of the Thames, in building against the sea, had been laid out at such a place as Southampton, much would have been saved and gained, and both engineers and employers would have gone to their graves with more large and lasting fame, both for skill and economy. But, numerous and important as the advantages of this scheme would be, if it were once completed and brought into full operation and effect, there still remains one point to be considered : \u2014 Would the southward-trading shipping of the Thames, or any considerable portion of it, come to the Southampton harbour, in the event of the docks and railway being completed? This is the vital question ; because, without a satisfactory answer to this in the affirmative, all the rest is but labour in vain ; \u2014 without this, neither the harbour nor the overland line could be supported. It so happens, too, that there are no positive data, upon which this question can be answered or even argued in a satisfactory manner. There are many instances of harbours being constructed or improved for the purpose of accommodating an established trade ; and in most of these the improved harbour has been followed by a great increase of trade, and often by the establishment of new branches, and also by the transfer of branches from other places. There are also instances, in which the constructing of VOL. I. br"], [278, "202 SOUTHAMPTON. a harbour and of commodious approaches to it, have produced a shipping trade where there was none previously. But we are not aware of any case of importance, in which mere ac commodation of ships and facilities for the land carriage of their cargoes, transferred the trade of a place, when that trade was in full and vigorous operation, and the place of the general mart for the sale, purchase, and exchange of all commodities in the trade. It may be, and it is admitted that, in the judgment of reason there would be many ad vantages in the transfer of the shipping part of the trade from London to Southampton, \u2014 an uncertain and dangerous part of the voyage, heavy expenses, and a harbour crowded to absolute confusion would be avoided, and time saved. But matters of this kind are not always regulated by the judgment of reason ; and there are so many parties \u2014 wealthy and influential parties, interested in the shipping coming directly to London, that custom, and prejudice, and interest, are all against reason in the matter ; and though not abso lutely invincible \u2014 certainly, these are very powerful. That London, taken as a whole, would be the better without a con siderable portion ofthe shipping now frequenting the Thames, we admit ; and we also admit that the shipping itself would be the better. But whether those concerned can be convinced of this is a different matter. Much of the capital now em ployed about the port of London, is of such a nature that it cannot be either transferred to another place, or applied to another purpose ; and, independently of this and all single considerations, the mere fact of the trade being established at London will have a powerful influence in keeping it there still. But this part of the question has, as we have said, no positive and experimental data, upon which it can have even an analogical solution ; and therefore we shall not enter further upon it. That the people of Southampton have pro secuted the project with the vigour they have displayed, is highly creditable to their spirit of enterprise and adventure ; and it shews that if they had a wider field for speculation and activity, they would not fail to cultivate that field ; but"], [279, ""], [280, "FRO. 1/ THE. srw RO ID ItS hid t'..P tkt Pr../.ri,b,r P-t ' iu././.t,. . li-.i,,, /;.

Southampton has an airy and pleasant appearance, whether seen from the approaches, or by passing along its own High street ; and the two pyramidal towers of the churches of St. Michael's and the Holy Rood, or Holy Cross, are features which no one can mistake. The lateral views of it differ much, according as they are taken from the east or the west. From the descent to Bitterne, or the Itchen Ferry, or the walk along the beach to Netley, it appears wholly a modern town, consisting of houses of diminutive size. From the opposite side, on the way to Redbridge, it appears ancient and fortified, with a portion of the wall still remaining. When, again, one approaches it by the high road from Lon don, it has much of the aspect of a city of great magnitude. There are numerous villas at the outskirts ; and the street is continuously built \u2014 at least with only a few openings, for fully a mile, \u2014 the buildings in the upper part being large and shewy, and the street wide. Further down, the width continues ; and at rather less than half a mile from the ter mination, the Bar Gate makes its appearance, pointing out the boundary between the old walled town, and the modern suburbs. We cannot stop to describe the gate. It is cha racteristic on the north side ; but rather spoiled by modern ising on the south. There are a carriage-arch and two foot arches, which have been brought to their present state at different periods. This gate seems to have been repeatedly strengthened, by addiditional thickening; or at all events restored, and a different style of arch has been used every time. The upper part contains the hall of the corporation, the windows of which are toward the High-street, below-bar. This is even wider than the High-street above-bar and its continuation along the London road ; and taking the two together, they certainly form one of the finest streets in England. This is the principal part of the town for busi- RB 2"], [282, "204 SOUTHAMPTON. ness ; and many of the shops are large and handsome, and some of them even spacious and splendid. The street itself is well paved, with broad and excellent side pavements; and, as it is the only fine street of the town, and the grand thoroughfare between London and the harbour, as a shipping port to the Isle of Wight, the Channel Isles, the shores of Normandy, and the shipping in the Channel, the crowd and bustle in it give it very much the air of one of the great thoroughfares of the metropolis ; and indeed it is more spa cious, and we may add, more handsome through its whole length than any of the great thoroughfares in London. It also has the advantage of terminating at the shipping place, without the nuisance of such a place as Rosemary-lane or Wapping, which give London an air of pest and poverty, both to those who come and those who go from the princi pal shipping places on the Thames. Travellers who merely pass along this street from the London road to the shipping place, or thence to the London road, would naturally con clude that Southampton is a much more elegant town than it is in reality. There are various polygons, terraces, and rows of handsome modern buildings, out of the main street, in the new part of the town above-bar ; but, excepting the High-street, all the streets below-bar, and the greater part of those in the eastern suburb are but second-rate. We omitted to mention that, on the upper side, the bar gate has the semblance of very formidable defence, \u2014 namely, by two leaden lions segant gardant, each with a staff and banneret in his paw, end behind them two wooden panels, on which are portrayed very fierce and formidable effigies of the redoubted Sir P^vois of Hanton, on the right, and the doughty but vanquished Ascapart on the other, \u2014 of course, right and left here apply to the gate itself, and are the reverse of the hands of a traveller, as he approaches from London. The view which our artist, Mr. Sargent, has given of the High-street, will afford the reader a correct notion of the inward side of the gate, upon which no lions or mighty men keep sentry ; but instead, there is, above the"], [283, ""], [284, "S (Q) OTM A Kfl LPT\u00a9 \u00c6T\u00c6ET SHEET ATTD BAR GATE Winchester.

The alarum-bell hangs near or over this statue, but whether for the purpose of con serving this matchless monument of majesty, or for keeping it in order, the very learned alone can determine. In the view which our artist has given of the High-street, and which is faithful both as to the general effect and the details, the reader will not fail to remark one peculiarity, namely, the frequent occurrence of bow-windows to the first and second and even the third floors \u2014 which shews that the inmates are very fond of having their eyes about them ; and we must admit that there are great inducements to this. Considering that it is only a business street, presenting the front or facade of no public edifice of any consequence, there are few finer street views than that of the High-street of Southampton ; and the terminations, when viewed upwards and downwards from about the middle of the length of the street, are peculiarly and strikingly varied. The view up wards is terminated by the bar gate, brought as nearly as possible to the aspect of a modern wall, stuccoed but not painted, and graced, not inappropriately, by the afore-men tioned statuary effigies of Queen Ann ; the view downwards is terminated by the scenery of the New Forest, or its borders, finely diversified by woodland and glade, and seen across the Southampton Water, with the masts and spars of the vessels in the anchorage, breaking the glare of the un ruffled water, and throwing back the distance with almost magic effect. No contrast can be more perfect, with the near subjects much the same, than these views upwards and downwards ; and this contrast appears as if intended to beckon the tourist onward to those delightful scenes, for the visiting of which"], [286, "206 SOUTHAMPTON. the Southampton Water affords such great, and in the prime of the view season, such delightful facility. Whether it has been construed and intended, that those who pass this way to the New Forest, the Isle of Wight, the shipping at Spit head, the Channel Islands, or France \u2014 to each and all of which it is the most delightful route both by sea and land, as well as the shortest and most certain (even without the rail way), and every way out of all comparison the best for tra vellers from the western part of England, as well as from the western side of Scotland and from Ireland ; \u2014 whether it has been intended that these should be treated with a romance, in making this part of the tour, and that without the least pause of the carriage wheel, or one farthing laid out in printed paper, we pretend not to say ; but really there is more of the essence of romance in this drive through Southampton, than if half the romance writers of the day had worn their appropriate goose-quills to the stumps by trying to make something like a romance of it. As you approach the \"Bar,\" the formidable face \u2014 the vul tus in hostem, which it shows in every part, instantly sug gests that there must be some Hesperides, with their golden fruit, of which all this formidable bearing keeps guard. Left and right, the giants are always at their posts, and the lions are open-mouthed, and are \u2014 or should be, \" langued gules\" at every hour of the day and night, the lamps shew ing them right formidably during the latter. Then the mouldings of the carriage-arch, from which the supporting pillars have been hewn off to give breadth to the roadway, hang portendingly in air, like a huge lunular portcullis, ready to drop, and crush you to atoms in its fork. And these are more alarming still \u2014 the machicollations from the battlements above, made expressly for casting all the annoy ances of war upon those who, unbidden, approach the gate. Now, the probability is, that you are not bidden, and you may also know that above you, and at no great distance from the receivers of these machicollations, the burghal senate carry on their deliberations. If, in addition to this, you"], [287, "207 SOUTHAMPTON. happen to have been in the land of the north, ancl have had to make your way, after night-fall, to the royal sanctuary of Holy Rood, you will have the dread of machicollations strong upon you, and be glad of the conopy even of the air pendent portcullis. After once clearing the gate, there is no temptation to look back, as the mighty queen storms you onward, and there is equal vigour on the part of the coach man, to run the gauntlet of the street in style. You heed not the enfilading of eyes from the all-bastioned windows, or the glances en recochet from the pave on either hand ; but catching new life from the activity of the scene, you rest not till you are on board the steam-boat, the easy motion of which \" gives you pause \" to meditate on the beauties of Southampton. The vicinity is delightful, and at every turn you take, there you may inhale fresh vigour and delight; but after the High-street, there is little in the town itself that can reward your observation \u2014 unless indeed you are a devoted antiquary, and delight in fragments of walls and gates, and traces of moats and ditches, simply because they are old. Of these there is no want ; and though, for the most part, they are concealed by more modern erections, they are per haps in better preservation than in places where their pris tine splendour was greater, and they have more story to tell. But the \" young life,\" whereof Southampton is so redolent, is the charm to those who court the living and not the dead ; and the casing up of the memorials of the past in the accom modations of present activity and enjoyment is, like the ivy upon the ruins, the relief of the place, and that which mainly attracts the birds, how much soever the lovers of cold stone may mourn the concealment of a corbel or a date under its ever verdant mantle. Modern Southampton is the ivy upon the ruins of the ancient fortified place ; and if this were taken away, all that remained would be like the ruins on the plantless hill or the sandy waste, upon which all the winds of Heaven wage war in turn, and where no tourist of the air can close its wings in safety."], [288, "208 SOUTHAMPTON. It is highly probable, nay we may say it is certain, that the concentration of the interest of Southampton upon its High-street is the main cause of the activity and enterprise for which the town is so remarkable ; for, though not usually stated, it is a truth, and a very philosophical and practically useful truth, that there is comparatively little of the energy of combination \u2014 the only energy by means of which great things can be done, or even projected, in places where the population is strewn over a number of streets, where all is equally tame and unmeaning, and each individual remains solitary in his den, like an oyster in its shell. Those who attend to the physical rearing of animals, know full well the deterioration which results from long-continued breed ing \" in and in.\" This tells upon human beings as well as upon any other species ; and it is just as applicable to the breeding of thoughts as of thinkers. He who thinks apart, long, often, and habitually, thinks himself out of all capa city of useful thought; and never can \"get out of the rut,\" which becomes the more imprisoning and the more painfully heavy to drag along, the more frequently and continuously it is used. Of this there is no danger in Southampton; and for this reason, the people there will successfully carry through projects, in which men of \" more might,\" inhabiting duller places, would utterly fail, and ruin themselves irre trievably by the failure, \u2014 just as feathers can fly, where lead, or even gold, would fall from to the earth, and lie lumbering there until lifted by some power not its own. It is to this spirit in Southampton that we are to look with the greatest and most satisfactory confidence for the realization of those hopes of which we took some notice in a former section ; and we do this, well knowing that mental energy is the best and surest of all resources, and that which can find the other elements of success, in situations where the duller minded would not only fail in the end, but lose in the progress of their failure, those other means of which they were in ample possession at the outset.

Now, towns and associations, whatever they may be called, are nothing but aggregates of individuals; and so, whatever of addi tional energy they may impart, they can give no new power ; therefore, what is established in the case of individuals must be perfectly true in the case of aggregates. Applying this to Southampton, in the way in which it is most instructive, as well as most pleasant, to contemplate the place and the people, we should feel disposed to say that there is much to hope, and but little to fear \u2014 except from prematurely at tempting great velocity before the requisite momentum has been acquired. But though, in Southampton, \" the people\" \u2014 in their energy and activity \u2014 \" are the sight,\" there are other \" lions\" of mere matter, than those which guard Sir Bevois and Ascapart at the Bar Gate. The church of St. Michael, in a little square between French and Bugle streets, to one's right of the High-street in proceeding to the harbour, and the church of the Holy Rood on the opposite hand, nearer the street and further down, are characteristic in their spires, though by no means elegant in their architecture, or favour ably situated for being seen as wholes. All-Souls, near the Bar Gate, is heavy and unchurchlike \u2014 so much so, that one would not easily find out the fact of its use without being told ; and it is very doubtful whether the addition of a florid Gothic front to St. Lawrence, falling as it must do into the ordinary line of the dwelling-houses and shops, will add much to the symmetrical beauty of the street. Churches should be in retired places, otherwise they are like a Sab bath in the middle of the week \u2014 or prayers in a play-house ; and the incongruity and offence to devotional feeling are especially striking and painful, when the building, or the visi- vol. i. ce"], [292, "210 SOUTHAMPTON. ble part of it, is in the old English style \u2014 the only style appro priate for a Christian church, as the model of it is not bor rowed from any heathen temple. The congruities are often sadly destroyed by an \" honest\" desire to \" ornament a street,\" which is as much out of character as bazaars in the aisles, to ornament a church, \u2014 or modern monuments of all the uncouth shapes and flaring colours upon earth, to ornament the solemn and awe-breathing walls of some stately cathe dral! The four churches now noticed, with that of St. Mary in the eastern fields, about midway between the walls and the Itchen, are all the parish churches within the borough of Southampton and its parliamentary liberty ; and in addition to these, there is one chapel on the left of the road from London, and, we believe, another on the common toward the north-western part of the liberty, where the pure air, the commanding view, and the ample scope for building, are col lecting a considerable population. The population of the whole is about 20,000, and the valued rent about J40,000 annually ; so that the valued rental is about the same as that of Winchester, and the population nearly double. This does not, however, afford an absolute criterion as to the average accommodation of the inhabitants of the two places ; for a far greater portion of the Winchester Jiberty is agricultural, containing few people in proportion to the rent, and the same may be said of that part which is extras-parochial. Still, after making allowances for these, the average lodging of the people is higher in Winchester than in Southampton ; from which the natural deduction is, that the humbler class of the people are better lodged- In Winkle-street, \u2014 which leads from the bottom of the High-street to the south-east gate, which, with the Bridewell over it and the gaol flanking it, is represented in one of the plates, \u2014 in Winkle-street, near this gate, there is a chapel in which the service is performed in French, chiefly to the natives of the Channel Isles, who frequent this part.

In respect of buildings and establishments for charitable purposes, for instruction, and for public amusement, there is not much to commend or complain of in Southampton. Foremost, among the charitable institutions, may be ranked the Royal Military Asylum for female children, which stands on one's right of the London road, at the entrance of the town ; but that is a national establishment, and not a growth of the town itself. The theatre takes precedence amongst the buildings for amusement ; and the free-school, and the Mechanics' Institution, among those for instruction. The public market-place is a thoroughfare, leading from High-street to French-street ; and the approaches are not in convenient, but there is a want of ventilation laterally. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and .Saturdays are the weekly markets; and there are four public fairs in the course of the year. Two weekly newspapers are published in the town ; and pretty largely circulated there and throughout the county. Such are some of the general points, and such a few of the details connected with Southampton, stated as much at length as our limits will admit, and, we trust, in the spirit of fairness and impartiality. There is, however, one other matter requiring a little notice, which can be best ap pended to the notice of Southampton ; and that is THE ESTUARY OF THE TEST, from the Southampton pier to the embouchure of the river at Redb ridge. This estuary, with its creeks and jetties may be regarded as an appendage of the Southampton harbour ; and the country along the northern shore, though not within the liberty or county, and the jurisdiction of the mayor and corporation, is yet a sort of suburb to Southampton.

Forest side, is about three quarters of a mile at high-water ; and at low-water about a furlong less, by the ebbing of the water from the bank at Cracknor. The length of the mid channel is about three miles and a half; but the windings of the shore-lines make them a little longer. The breadth averages about three quarters of a mile for the whole length, at high-water ; but the low-water channel narrows to about a furlong at more than a mile below Redbridge ; at the wharfs there it is barely a hundred yards and it contracts so much as to blend with the channel of the Test, at the bridge from which the village takes its name. At high-water, and especially when a fresh of the river is met by a wind from the south-east, a considerable portion of the meadows is laid under water; and even on ordinary occasions, there are reedy pools, and marshes, interspersed by patches of more solid ground which are regularly irrigated when the water is dammed-up by the tide. From these circumstances, the vegetation is very rank, unfit for pasturage or for hay, except to a very trifling extent ; and this character continues for some way up the natural channel of the river ; but, like the channel below, contracting as it extends. Various aquatic birds nestle here, and among the rest (we believe) the com mon gull, and perhaps also the laughing gull ; but even the former is rare in this estuary, as there is little action of the water, and the chalky beaches are not very favourable to those smaller animals, upon which gulls must feed when the action of the sea does not cast up their greater prizes. The tame^ shores are against the rock-breeders, which are the more splendid scavengers of the sea ; and, accordingly, these are rarely seen, and wThen seen it is only as stragglers. From Southampton harbour upwards, the banks are much broader on the Southampton side of the estuary than on the New Forest side ; but they are so covered by aquatic plants in the summer, that they have something of the appear ance of water-meadows, only upon coming close to them, this deception is easily perceived. There are no creeks for the greater part of the length, as there is no stream of suffi"], [297, "SOUTHAMPTON. 213 cient magnitude to have kept a channel open for itself while the banks were forming. Landing-places, capable of accom- modating even lighters of any considerable burden, are ac- cordingly few ; and they consist of barge-runs , kept open in part by scouring, and of wooden jetties projecting from the hards, or of causeways made in the shallows. If there were any inducement, a very considerable portion of the surface of these shallows might be embanked, and converted into land at no very great expense ; or into meadows at very little, except the expense of the embankments. Without some admixture, the deposit, as it now lies, would not be very productive even of grass, as it is too close and firm for giving proper admission to the roots, or to the water and air requi- site for their production and nourishment. This embank- ment is not necessary for the present shipping of the estuary or to prevent the choking up of the channel by silt, as the process of silting, if now going on at all, is certainly very slow in its progress. The trifling brooks which come in, do not in any way disturb the banks ; and as the Test itself is filtered by water-meadows and reeds, besides consisting, like the Itchen, of very pure water, the annual deposit by it must be very trifling. The extent of the banks shows that at some period the condition of the river must have been very different from what it is at present ; for these banks are deposits upon the original gravel, sand, or clay, which, we believe, is in most places found under them, and gene- rally at no very great depth. This deposit contains too much chalk in its composition for having been produced by any action of the sea upon the shores against which it is deposited ; and there is no sign of any such action or of any cause capable of producing it, upon any of the shores of this estuary, at least since the formation of the substratum of gravel and sand, which are certainly older than the banks in question. At their present rate of increase, the formation of these banks would have required a very long period of years ; and from this we are led to the conclusion, that the state of the upper country was then very different from what it is"], [298, "214 SOUTHAMPTON. now. The most likely hypothesis \u2014 and nothing more satis factory than hypothesis can be obtained upon the subject, \u2014 the most likely hypothesis is, that the woods were, at some early period, destroyed much more rapidly than was consis tent with the safety of the space from which they were cleared \u2014 just as has been done by ignorant settlers in Canada and various other parts of North America ; and that the soil, made tender by the long continuance of the over-shadowing woods, was exposed in greater breadth than could be imme diately sown with artificial crops ; and thus the frosts loosened it, the winds swept and the rains washed it into the courses of the brooks, and the flooding of these bore it onward to the estuary, where the resistance of the high water \u2014 of which there are four returns in the lunar day, threw it into the eddies of the shores, where it was depo sited, probably in fewer years than it would require centuries to deposit such banks in the present state of the waters, and of the surfaces along which the waters flow. We partially alluded to this, when noticing the estuary of the Itchen ; but, as the Test is, by much, the larger river of the two, we might be prepared to find it more conspicuously in the Test. And we do find that such is the case, by taking a standard for the two, which may be regarded as contem poraneous in both, and certainly, not more early applicable to the Test than to the Itchen. That standard is the situa tion of the Roman station for galleys, in reference to the present tideway of both rivers. Now, the tide continues to ebb and flow for a mile and a half, or nearly so, above the Roman station at Bitterne; and the tideway of the Test ceases to be available, for any kind of shipping, at least two miles below the station at Nutshalling, which was the Roman port on that river. Therefore, we have evidence very little short of demonstration, that the estuary of the Test has un dergone far greater changes since the time of the Romans than that of the Itchen; though, as to what the agents in those changes may have been we know nothing, further than that they must have produced surface action only, with-"], [299, "215 SOUTHAMPTON. out the least influence of those more powerful agents which produce the greater changes in the materials of our globe. Along the banks of this estuary, there is none of that vio lent action of the sea air which stunts the trees, nips their foliage, and gives them so mean and ragged an aspect. Below Southampton, there are more traces of this, though they do not extend far from the line of high-water ; but on the New Forest shore they are barely perceptible even there ; and above, the town, and the hard upon which it stands, completely shelter the shore upon this side from searblight, so that the aspect is that of the bank of a lake rather than the shore of an arm of the sea ; and the general state of the water itself completes the picture. The fact is, that this part of the Southampton Water has the effect as well as the appearance of a lake. It is not the vapour of the sea which is, in any situation, injurious to the growth and foliage of trees. The saline matters do not rise in the ordinary process of evaporation ; and thus the humidity which rises imperceptibly and silently from the surface, is as bland and as congenial to the tenderest leaf, as that which rises from the most inland lake or the most limpid stream. The tidal banks, again, have much the same effect as the water meadows by the rivers ; and, in warm and dry weather, they have it in a higher degree. This is easily perceived upon a hot day in summer ; for, on those heights which are beyond the reach of the vapour from the water, and the light zephyr produced by the process of evaporation, upon the wings of which it comes, the leaves are flaccid and action less during the greater part of the day, even though, in con sequence of the susceptibility of most parts of the surface there to the action of the sun, there is more alternation of moisture between the earth and atmosphere than over sur faces of different geological character. But though this nourishes the herbage, the drought tells upon the foliage of the trees ; and this is the chief reason why the Hampshire trees, except in the low and humid bottoms, are so short in the bole, and so remarkable for their branching. In summer,"], [300, "216 SOUTHAMPTON. a deciduous tree depends more upon the humidity which its leaves absorb directly from the atmosphere, than herbaceous plants do, and much more than upon the moisture which it drains from the earth by means of its roots ; and thus, the disposition of such trees to branch and spread in breadth at a small height, always shows that there is a dry atmo sphere at no great elevation above the surface. The oak is a very certain index in this way ; and, among evergreens \u2014 which have the same propensity, though not quite so strongly, perhaps the yew is among the best. Both of these species are abundant in Hampshire ; they are found in almost every variety of situation ; and therefore, to any one who will take the trouble of delighting himself with the study of those more beautiful and valuable workings of nature, which must be inferred not observed, these trees are the means of continual instruction. If the tree branches low upon the slope, and the margin of the forest fines off into small bushes upon the common, one may take up one's abode in full confidence of breathing a healthy and delightful atmosphere ; and, it is worthy of remark, that this fining off of the forest till it vanishes in small flat bushes upon the open grassy down, is that which takes it into the rest of nature as a harmonious part ; and thus gives the finishing touch to its beauty. On the contrary, if the trees, when not closely serried together, run up into poles, with the lateral branches sickly and in a state of decay, we may be sure that the top is seeking a more dry and healthy atmosphere than that through which it has spindled up \u2014 and seeking it in vain. If spindly trees, standing alone, and with their lower branches feeble and in a state of decay, are abundant in any locality, the air of that locality should be avoided by the delicate, as \"reck o' the rotten fens,\" whatever may be the character of the surface and the state of the atmosphere at the time of observation. No county in England is more favourable for putting this species of observation into valuable practice than Hamp shire ; and no spot in Hampshire is more appropriate than the banks of the estuary of the Test, whether on the South ampton or the New Forest side."], [301, "217 SOUTHAMPTON. If invalids, and they who have the care and counselling of invalids, would but study these matters attentively, and act upon the knowledge which they would thence obtain, much pain and suffering would be avoided, and many whose bones are laid in the land of strangers, would be alive and in health, useful and happy in their own country. There is a renovating virtue in the Hampshire air, not to be equalled in many parts of Britain, or excelled in perhaps any country in the world \u2014 not excepting the far-famed isles of the At lantic themselves. We say not this hypothetically, but from actual experience ; and this experience warrants us in stat ing that they, whom labour, care, unremitting thought and anxiety, and that change of the system which is the natural result of these, have brought without the pale of reasonable hope, and almost to the gates of death, will be speedily re stored to full, elastic, and bounding health, if they have strength left, and resolution to put that strength in exercise upon down and dale in the life-giving air of this county ; which realises more than the Bard of Health sings of the action of land and water, in the sultry climes of the sun, and this without the contrast alluded to in the second of his matchless lines \u2014 matchless in their philosophic truth, and in the contrast both of their subjects and their cadence : \u2014 \" The breeze eternal, breathing round their limbs, Supports in close intolerable air.\" The sea and land-breezes, whose refreshing influence Arm strong so well describes, are medicinal chiefly in their mo tion; and they heal the atmosphere, which when still is pes tilent, whether over the burning land, the reeking water, or the mangrove-matted shore that divides the two. But in Hampshire, the air itself is substantially the medicine, and the breeze is only the messenger that fetches it. Thus, though its beaches are not so tempting, and the sea and its shores are not so sublime \u2014 or terrific, as it may be, as those of many of the other watering places in England, there are charms and advantages in the Southampton Water, and certainly not less in the estuary of the Test than VOL. I. DD"], [302, "218 SOUTHAMPTON. in the other parts of it, which not one of them now pos sesses, or can possess. The air, the scenery, the perfect se clusion whenever it is desired, the wholesome provisions, and the freshness, abundance, and comparative cheapness of all the fruits of the earth, are not obtained or obtainable at any place on the line of the open sea-coast, where one half of the horizon is watery expanse. These reflections force themselves upon our attention, during the ride or promenade along the bank of the estuary from Southampton to Redbridge, \u2014 which is not too long for a healthful promenade, and very delightful in any mode of journey by which there is leisure enough to study it. The only provoking part of the matter is, that the mental en joyment of this short line of transit is apt to steal our eyes away from the topographical beauties, which are by no means inconsiderable. For somewhat more than a mile from the turnpike, on the London road from Southampton, where the road in ques tion branches off, and at little more than half a mile, parts off to the right, the road to Southampton Common and to Romsey by Shirley Warren \u2014 both of which are airy, diver sified, and pleasant drives; \u2014 for this length, the road is on the height, and at some distance from the water ; but views both of the water and the New Forest lie, and are ever and anon shown through the trees, with the mud-bank hidden even at low-water, and the distance thrown back by the foreground ; and, the distance is not so great as to pre vent the freshness ofthe water from being felt, and the height is so little, that no part of any of the pictures which present themselves in succession is \" breadthed out\" in the unseemly character of a bird's-eye view, in which what is presented to the beholder is flattened to the dull and \" all-the-same-distance\" character of an Indian screen, in consequence of the eye looking down upon the whole of it. This is neither the time nor the place for going into any disquisition on the economy of the eyes, so as to enjoy the greatest possible amount of the beauty of nature in the shortest time and"], [303, "SOUTHAMPTON. 219 with the least labour \u2014 though no species of knowledge is more valuable to one who seeks healthful pleasure in such scenes as these. Still, we may mention that the best posi tion is that in which the axis of the eye proceeds on a per fect level to the centre of the picture ; because, then, all around that centre is seen to equal advantage as far as the field of view extends. Whereas, if the axis has much in clination either upwards or downwards, the view is distorted \u2014 magnified when we have to look up to it, and diminished when we look down : \u2014 a pigmy on a cliff, projected against the sky, is magnified to a giant ; and a giant at the bottom, projected against the ground, is shrunken to a pigmy. This is worthy of being borne in mind, especially in those parts of Hampshire, where, though man is in his appropriate place for quiet and substantial enjoyment, nature is the grand fascination. After one descends the heights, the beach is arrived at, and the view to one's right is confined to the hedge, a few very plain cottages, and the tops of the trees beyond. On the left, there is the estuary, fresh, but flat even at high water. Onward, the long and straggling village of Mil brook makes its appearance, rural, neat, and inviting ; and cottages and small villas succeed each other at short dis tances, upon both sides of the road, for the entire mile and a half from here to the head of the estuary at Redbridge. The line of the bank makes a bend to the southward, so as to be, at some places at least, a quarter of mile from the road ; consequently the water itself is not seen but at particular openings ; and thus, though so near to spots where sea bathing can be had, the place has all the air of an inland village. No places can be more desirable as summer retreats, for such as seek the real enjoyment both of the land and the water, with perfect retirement, delightful walks, and all the attributes of sober enjoyment, than the neat little boxes which are so numerous here. Generally speaking they are detached ; they are all neat, ancl there is no very large man sion in the vicinity to diminish the importance of these little dd2"], [304, "220 SOUTHAMPTON. places by contrast. At the same time, Southampton is within a very easy ride, and by no means a labourious walk ; and from its pier, the most delightful water excursions can be made, without anything disagreeable and dangerous, and at a very moderate expense. There is no crowding of vessels, no tumbling water, no strong current, and no hazard of any kind ; so that the most timid and delicate may here enjoy the water without any possibility of annoyance. Then, when the railroad is in full play, this pleasant retreat may be reached from the metropolis in about five hours, so that a London man of business could attend 'Change, and be at this spot in time for supper with his family ; and also, by practising a little wholesome early rising, he might leave this spot on a summer morning, and be in London in time for business hours. This is a readiness of intercourse which, when brought fully to bear, will not be excelled by any spot worthy the name of a watering place, and certainly not equalled by any one where the advantages are so many and so superior as they are here. The road which passes through the village is also a great thoroughfare, from both extremities of which numerous roads branch off ; \u2014 from the Redbridge end, to the New Forest, to Dorset and Devon, and all the westerly coast of the Channel; and to Wilts, Somerset, Gloucester, the northern parts of Hants, and in fact to the whole of the west of England and Scotland, to Wales and to Ireland ; while the branches from Southamp- ton lead directly along the eastern counties on the Channel, to the metropolis, and to the whole east and centre of Eng- land and Scotland. \u2014 Such are the facilities of communication between all parts of the British Islands, and one of the most eligible spots that can possibly be selected for the recovery of health, or for such a summer residence as shall keep the health out of the necessity of recovery. Milbrook is an extensive, valuable, and populous parish, \u2014 the valued rental being 8308/., and the population about 2800, inclusive of visitors.

The village ter minates at the brook from which it is named ; but the parish includes the village of Redbridge, the scattered outskirts of which begin immediately where Milbrook ends ; and the principal part of the village, which is closely built, and has the air of a small town of no inconsiderable trade and im portance, adjoins the eastern abutment of the bridge from which it takes its name ; and there are wharfs, ship-building yards, and other indications of an active little post for coast ing trade, along a considerable range of the bank. The view which our artist has given of this pleasant and bustling village is from the opposite bank of the Test, a little above the bridge ; and those who are familiar with the scene will at once perceive how graphically faithful it is, both to the general effect and the details. Redbridge, from its being the last shipping place at the head of the Southampton Water, and as such, the port to the valley of the Test, and also to Salisbury, has always been, and will continue to be, a place of considerable resort for vessels in the coasting trade. It is also one of the main land-entrances to the New Forest; and a principal point in the line of communication along the whole coast of the Channel. The adjoining country is rich and beautiful, and the garden grounds belonging to the village itself, though light, are remarkable for the abundance and the excellent quality of their produce. The trade inwards consists chiefly of coal, pine timber, slates, and other sea-borne articles, required for the consumption of the valley of the Test, and all the adjoining places to which it is the port; and the principal export is grain, The Andover Canal, by means of which a water-carriage is obtained of about 22| miles, with a fall of about 177 feet \u2014 or not quite 8 feet in the mile upon the average, may be divided into three lengths: first, from the sea-lock to Romsey, rather more than 5 miles, with a fall of 10 feet to the mile ; secondly, from Romsey to Stockbridge, about 9 miles, with a fall of less than 7 feet to"], [308, "222 SOUTHAMPTON. the mile ; and thirdly, from Stockbridge to the termination at Andover, rather less than 8 miles, with a fall of less than 8 feet to the mile. The flatness of the middle-reach as com pared to the other two, indicates a different character of this part of the valley, of which some notice will be taken here after. Coal, lime, stone, and manure of different kinds, are among the chief articles carried upon this canal ; but the upward cargoes greatly exceed the downward, and the barges often descend empty. Though not the Roman station for galleys in the time when they were in this part of England, Redbridge is an ancient place, and was of some note in the time of the Sax ons. At first there was no bridge ; for Reod-fiord is the earliest name that occurs in history ; and this of course means that the Test was fordable here \u2014 at low-water, and that the place abounded with reeds. The name vadum arun dinis, given to it by the venerable Bede, has exactly the same meaning, \u2014 vadare and fiordan both signifying \"to pass through the water ; \" and the other being the literal transla tion of \" reeds.\" Now, after the bridge has been long con structed, and along with it a cause-way made on the right bank of the Test, reeds are still abundant, and they must have been much more so at the time when neither bridge nor causeway existed. That there must have been a bridge constructed here in the time of the Saxons is obvious, because Redbridge is the name of the place in Doomsday Book, and as the epithets in that book are all taken from circumstances which were in existence at the time, there would have been no mention of a bridge if one had not actually existed. The word bridge is the verb or noun answering to the verb breochen, \" to be stride\" \u2014 as the bridge stands as it were, with one foot on each side ofthe water \u2014 and has no reference whatever to fiordan, which means to pass a narrow water, whether on foot or in a boat, The word \" firth,\" fiord, which we find in the north ern languages, is merely a noun for a water which is no stop page, but by means of which one can \"go forth ;\" and there"], [309, "223 SOUTHAMPTON. are many instances of its application in the north of Britain, where the population has more Scandinavian admixture than the south. That which appears to have given importance to Redbridge in the early times was a monastery, of which not an archi tectural vestige and scarcely a historical notice remains, far ther than that a person named Cymberth was at some time the abbot. That is enough however to raise a historical question which the monkish chroniclers appear to have been most sedulous to blink, and which has not been mooted by late historians. The question to which we allude, and which rises of itself and forces itself upon our notice is, the mo tive of St. Birinus, and the other \"holy men\" as they are termed, who first converted, or gained over, our ancestors to the Christian religion. Be it understood that of the inestimable value of Christianity in itself, and of the .bless ings which England has derived, is deriving, and will continue to derive, from the Reformed Christian religion, we have not a doubt \u2014 we raise not a suspicion \u2014 we freely admit that it is the foremost blessing of the land \u2014 the \" liv ing fountain from which all our minor blessings and advan tages flow.\" But admitting this \u2014 as we will not and dare not fail to admit it, we may question the motives of the early monks with the same freedom as we would any other matter of human enterprize and ambition. Thus questioning, we look at the state and dispositions of the church of Rome \u2014 something very different from the church of Christ, at the time when the said St. Birinus came to convert the West Saxons to the Roman faith. This happened in the ponti ficate of Gregory the Great, whose object was to erect the church over the throne, as a temporal power, in every region of the world to which his influence could be extended ; and looking at his elevation, we have no hesitation in saying, a priori, that, in instigating Birinus to come to this part of Britain, he was actuated, not by fatherly care for the souls of the Saxons, but by the desire to add another province to the empire of the tiara, and bring the wealth for which this"], [310, "224 SOUTHAMPTON. part of England was then renowned, under the sacerdotal clutch. If the case had been otherwise, we would ask, why it came that there was a religous house, or a house calling itself religious, founded upon every spot better than another, and why the ecclesiastics of the day worked on and on until they got possession of all that was most fertile in the land, and all that was most rich and estimable in the way of posses sion1? Our modern ecclesiastics do not act in this manner: The present bishop and dean and chapter of Winchester, do not \" quest and quarter\" the land, like hounds on the slot, and cozen kings and nobles out of the most fertile parts of it, as property to the church ; and yet who shall dare to say that they are less faithful in the service of their great Mas ter, or less zealous for the eternal welfare of the people than those of the olden time, who bartered the promise of salva tion in the next world, for the real estates of men in the present one % That Christianity in any shape is better than the worship of Woden, Thor, and Freiga, we readily admit ; but we must say that that Christianity could be neither pure nor spiritual, which, in so short a time, got possession of all the better spots of the land of the West Saxons ; and got it for the fattening of a race of men estranged from society and from usefulness, and of no value whatever to the rulers of the people, either for this world or the next. Fortunately for us of the present time, these mummeries have gone, and their memorials serve no purpose save that of adding a little to the effect of a landscape here and there ; but still it is useful to resort to them, for the purpose of showing us from what we ourselves have escaped, and teaching us to sympathise with those who are still, in part, under the same degrading and spirit-quenching infliction. Whatever of monastic or other importance Redbridge may have had in the time of the Saxons has now passed away, and the village is, to all intents and purposes, modern. Even the story of the two sons of Arvandus prince of the Isle of Wight, being found in their hiding place near it, and being murdered by order of Ceadwalla the Saxon, is very"], [311, "SOUTHAMPTON. 225 doubtful ; and if such an event ever took place, the probabi lity is that it was near Stoneham on the Itchen ; for ad La pidem is the name given to the little town, and this may have meant \" Stoneham,\" by which name two parishes are still called, and which was no doubt given from one or more of those large boulders, alien to the strata of the district, the fetching of which is sometimes, not unabsurdly, attributed to the Druids. It is probable that the causeway which leads from Red bridge to the village of Totton may be, in part at least, as ancient as the Saxon bridge ; because it is not likely that a bridge would be erected over the channel of the river, ancl a large marsh left at the one end by which the bridge would have been, in a great measure, rendered useless. In part at least, the present bridge is not modern, but the date of it is not known. Indeed, the chief interest which Redbridge now possesses, arises from its situation as the last shipping place on the Southampton Water, and as the key to the valley of the Test, to the New Forest, and other districts to the south, east, and west. Recently, however, it has begun to resume a con siderable portion of its former bustle ancl activity as a ship building place ; and, we believe, some of the ship-owners of London have found it more advantageous to build ships here than on the banks of the Thames. They are judicious in so thinking ; and if they persevere, they will eventually be nefit the village and neighbourhood \u2014 and themselves. The importance of Redbridge at the time of the Conquest, is further proved by its giving name to a hundred, although with the exception of a small patch round the village, this hundred lies wholly on the opposite bank of the Test and of the estuary \u2014 extending about three miles up the former, and down the latter to opposite Southampton, and reaching back to the New Forest. The villages of Totton, Rambridge, and Eling, which lie contiguous to each other and immediately opposite to Redbridge, afford further evidence of the impor tance of this spot. Eling is the parish village, and there is a creek leading to it formed by the estuary of a small brook VOL. I. EE"], [312, "226 SOUTHAMPTON This creek is navigable for crafts of considerable burden, a number of which resort to it, and viewed from the bridge over the Test, they have a very unique appearance, as the creek itself is not visible, and they seem as if they were not in the water at all, but in a field amid a grove of trees. As is the case with Redbridge, Eling is well adapted for ship-building, on account of the proximity to abundance of oak timber. There are some waste places, as well as a few marshy spots in this neighbourhood , but the land is in general a strong clayey loam, a little laborious in the working, but very pro ductive in favourable seasons. The small patches of alluvial land both here and at Redbridge, are deep, though light, excel lent for fruit trees, and capable of growing culinary vegeta bles luxuriantly and rapidly, and of the finest flavour. Con sidering the extent of humid surface, there is very little damp, and the climate well merits the epithet \" delightful.\""], [313, "227 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. CHAPTER VII. THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. Though the Itchen is more central to the county; and, from the situation of Winchester on its banks and Southampton at its confluence with the sea, of much more historical im portance than the Test ; yet the latter is really the prince of Hampshire rivers. In the beautiful transparency of its wa ters, and their perfect fitness for household use and for every purpose for which pure water is necessary, it yields to no river in the kingdom. Like the Itchen, and all the other rivers and streams in the south of Hampshire, and in other counties of the same form of surface and the same geologi cal formation, the Test is nowhere rapid in its current, nei ther does it, at least in the present state of the district through which it flowTs, expand into lakes, or even stagnate in pools. It flows on with a gentle current, but one which is every where perceptible ; so that, although it has nothing either grand or picturesque in its appearance, it everywhere merits the epithet of a \"living water,\" adding much to the beauty and fertility of the country, and being seviceable as a water power, by means of a very short mill-course, at almost any part of its whole length, \u2014 while its waters are all along serviceable, iu irrigating and rendering productive the ad joining flats and meadows. Like the other south-running rivers of the country, it is what may, with the strictest propriety, be called an \" an agri- EE 2"], [314, "228 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. cultural\" river. Its volume of water and fall \u2014 and the latter is attainable in any moderate length, are not adequate to the turning of any very powerful machinery, but answer exceedingly well for ordinary corn-mills, and every species of manufacturing operation, in which the use of very pure water is essential, could, if other circumstances and the fashion of the times \u2014 for there is fashion in such matters, were favourable, be carried on with great advantage upon the banks of the Test. As matters are now conducted, however \u2014 and it is not likely and perhaps not desirable that they should change \u2014 no manufacture to any extent can be carried on except in the vicinity of eoal, or in that of some great mart where there is a constant demand for the articles which are manufactured. Coal cannot be cheaply delivered on any part of the Test, by any of the contrivances of the pre sent age, fertile as it is in improvement ; and as the demand is in a great measure confined to local necessaries, that cannot be so much concentrated at any one spot, as to originate and support any manufacture of consequence. From these circumstances, the Test can be considered in no other light than as an agricultural river. It is true that the canal from Redbridge to Andover, of which we have already given some notice, is supplied by the water of the Test, and follows the course of the river to within a mile or two of the source of the Anton, or Andover branch ; but the traffic carried on by means of this canal is very trifling, and must continue to be so, unless the state of the country shall undergo some change of which there is at present no prospect. This canal occasions a diversion of the water of the river, and the irrigating the meadows occasions the same ; so that, through the whole course of the Test, there are very few points at which the water can be seen in one body, and its absolute quantity judged of. It is however a small river compared with the length of its course ; and though, like the Itchen, it receives a few trifling brooks in the lower part of its valley, it probably contains a greater body of water seve ral miles from the sea, than it does at its embouchure."], [315, "229 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. The whole length of the Test, from its most upland source to its confluence with the sea at Redbridge, is about thirty-four miles, including the several windings. The source is in the great northern ridge of the county, about five miles from the source of the Embourne on the other side, and not more than eight from the Kennet in Berks. The various springs which supply it, come out between the remainder of the gravel caps and the chalk of which the great mass of the heights is composed. The springs in grounds of this description do not come out in the same splendid style as they do in formations of rock, where they are deep seated, and the water is collected into reservoirs under ground. In the gravel and chalk formations, there are no means of under-ground accumulation. The water which falls on the surface, percolates through the gravel as through a filter, and then trickles out between that and the chalk, in great purity ; but, generally speaking, along the line of separation between the strata, rather than in any volume which amounts to a definite spring at any particular spot. The filtration which the water undergoes in its pas sage through the gravel, and the action of the chalk, by which its descent is arrested, both tend to purify it from the spor\u00e6 of mosses, and those decomposed animal and vegeta ble matters which water is apt to contain, when it merely flows through fissures without any filtration; and this is the reason why rivers and streams, which have their sources in such formations, are so well adapted for the manufacture of speckless paper, and for all detergent purposes in the household, as well as for every other operation in the per formance of which water is essential. But the process by which this water is formed into springs is so slow, and the surface by which it is absorbed so great, that a very consi derable extent of the heights is without any appearance of running water, or even of stagnant pools, unless where these are accumulated in artificial reservoirs. As we remarked of the Itchen, \u2014 and, indeed, as is the case with the rivers in all the chalk counties, the chief part"], [316, "230 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. of the water comes out in the upper part of the valley, be tween the gravel and the chalk ; and there are no branches until one comes to the clay and gravel formations in the lower part of the valley. But, as the Test is, altogether, a much longer river than the Itchen, so the sources of it are ramified over a far greater extent of country; and, if the extent of the heights is taken, from source to source of the most easterly and most westerly branches, the general course, without including the minor flexures, is nearly the same as the length of the river. Taking the Test as the basis of a topographical sketch of the county through which it flows, there are five natural sections into which it may be conveniently divided. First, the main trunk of the river, from Redbridge to Kilecombe bridge three miles above Stockbridge, which is a length of about eighteen miles including the windings ; and here there is no branch of much consequence that joins it. Secondly, the first, or Andover branch, which rises from several sources, each two or three miles distant from the borough of Andover, toward which all of them converge. Thirdly, the first eastern, or left-hand branch, which rises near Strat ton Park, and flows in a westerly direction for about twelve miles with a very winding course, and inosculates with the main stream of the river for the last two or three miles. Fourth ly, the Whitchurch branch, which rises in or about Ash Park, six miles to the west of Basingstoke, and about three and a half from the source of the Lodden \u2014 which flowing in the opposite direction, ultimately finds its way to the Thames. This branch is sometimes called the Anton, as well as the Andover branch, which name is also given to the whole ri ver, and to the estuary. Fifthly, the main branch of the upper river, from the source near Upton, to where the Whit church branch joins, near Hurstbourne Priors, and the length of this is about nine miles. The lengths of all these upper branches are, however, sub ject to considerable variations according to the character of the season. In long-continued droughts, the channels of"], [317, "THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. 231 the rivulets are dry for miles ; and excepting in a few small ponds and pits, which latter contain a siskin-green liquid, very unseemly, but we believe not very unwholesome, there is not a drop of water to be met with ; while, after long-con tinued rains, there is no want of water, either stagnant or running. The valleys of all the branches are very distinct; and there is no running water in any of them save the river it- self. The branches are few and insignificant, and the supply in most places, trickles out close to the margin of the allu- vial flat which forms the chief part of the valley. This is the character of the smaller ramifications, as well as of the larger ones ; and wherever there is a stream, either per- manent or existing for a considerable part of the year, advan- tage is invariably taken of it, for the irrigation of the mea- dows. Besides these meadows, and a very few of the glades and lawns immediately abutting on the water, and but a lit- tle above the level of the drains of the irrigating channels, there are few spots near the valley of the Test, and not many in the whole county, of which hay of natural grasses can be made, or indeed, which are available as grazing land. Hence, very few cattle \"are reared in the county, or the dis- trict ; and there are no dairies of any consequence. Cattle would soon graze themselves hungry upon the elevated downs ; and even the sheep are few, when compared with the breadth of surface, which is used as sheep-pasture, and in its present state, fit for nothing else. Upon these downs, the air is very cold in winter, and keen at ajl seasons of the year ; but it is at all times healthy, and even favourable to vegetation of humble growth, as shown by the closeness of the sward upon the surface. There are also few spots which might not be brought under the plough, but there is a pau- city of manure, and the naked surface upon which the turf has been broken up, is severely scourged by the heats of early autumn and the rains of late autumn and winter ; and there are cold and chilling blasts in the spring ; while the wdnds sweep to the hollows all that has been loosened"], [318, "232 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. and left by the other agents which exert themselves power fully upon this much-exposed surface. Generally speaking the soil is more favourable when a portion of the gravel re mains than where the chalk is exposed ; for the chalky up lands, where there are no sheltering woods, are wasted away till the surface appears to be completely sown with flints. In some places these flints are collected for the repair of the roads and other domestic purposes ; but it is doubtful whether this removal is judicious, as the flints not only help to retain a portion of humidity in dry weather, but break the current of the winds, and shelter the young plants when the spring is severe. They however render the surface unsightly, are a great annoyance to the scythe of the mower, and make the land most inconvenient for pasturage, for which indeed it is naturally but ill adapted, from the slowness with which any species of vegetables tillers upon it so as to form a per manent covering. It is on the cultivated fields that these flints appear so abundant on the surface ; for upon the downs which have still their natural carpeting of grass they are com paratively few, and when they do appear upon these the removal of them is an advantage. This part of Hampshire has been, in former times, the scene of many hostilities ; and there are very few of the heights which are not marked by traces of what had once been strong encampments, some of them of very considera ble size. Two Roman roads, the one forming a communication between Winchester and Old Sarum, and the other between Silchester and the same ancient fortification, can still be traced in various places ; as well as a third one from the port of Nutshalling, of which some notice has already been taken. If we may judge from the remains of the road from Winchester, which crossed the Test about three or four miles below Stockbridge, it has been, at least in so far as Hampshire is concerned, the most frequented of the three, as there are the remains of more forts and barrows upon it, or in its vi cinity, than upon any of the others. This road extends about nine miles on the eastern, or left-hand side of the"], [319, "233 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. valley, and about five miles on the western side, before it enters the county of Wilts. Excepting the old entrenched camp, a quarter of a mile to the right of this road, and five miles from Winchester, there is no ancient fort or other monu ment immediately on the line. Whether this entrenchment was Roman, and a resting-place for Roman soldiers on their march, it is impossible to say ; but there are no barrows immediately upon, or apparently connected with it, though there are many on a line nearly parallel to it, and only a few miles farther to the north, and more on the slope of the northern heights. The greatest number of barrows are an Broughton down, about a mile and a half beyond Stockbridge and on the north side of the road. These barrows are probably con nected with the old fort on Deanbury hill, which some have very injudiciously supposed to be Danish, and named after that people ; whereas, the probability is, that it is of earlier date than the arrival of the Romans, and was constructed by a people who did not make roads. To increase the mis take, one detached barrow, about a mile and a half to the north-west of Deanbury, is popularly called \"Canute's Bar row,\" though it can have little connexion with him ; and certainly is not the place of his interment, which would be the only rational ground for calling it after him. So far as the barrows can give evidence, they show that they are not Roman ; for those upon the Wiltshire Downs, and especially near Stonehenge, where they are exceedingly numerous, have been opened and examined by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and others ; and in none of them has there been found any remain which could decidedly be pronounced to be Roman. They were found to contain a number of arti cles which indicated a certain degree, but by no means a high degree, of civilisation. Human bones, some of them partially calcined and others not, and also sepulchral urns of rude workmanship, were the chief relics found. There were also spear-heads and other weapons of brass or bronze, cups and other utensils of coarse pottery and of VOL. I. FF"], [320, "234 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. horn, and beads and other ornaments of amber. Many of these circumstances would lead to the conclusion, that the barrows, which have been thus examined, were constructed by a people who had, at some period or other, migrated from the north of Europe near to the Baltic; as that has been, from the remotest antiquity, and continues to be, one of the principal countries in which amber is found. These facts appear to be conclusive of the existence of the barrows pre vious to the arrival of the Romans in the country ; and they also indicate, in a pretty clear manner, the people by whom these erections were made, ancl many, at least, of the forts constructed. Now, whatever is true of the Wiltshire barrows, must also be true of those in Hampshire, for they are not only near to each other, but there are straggling ones in the in termediate space ; ancl this, as well as the perfect similarity of their character, proves that they all belong to the same epoch, and are the work of the same people. In some parts of Scotland, there are sepulchral erections bearing considerable resemblance in their contents to these southern ones, only they are formed of stones, and locally known by the name of cairns. These cairns are most abun dant in the bleak heights of the northern lowlands, which is the part of the country known to have been very early invaded by the Celtic and other tribes from that part of Germany whence the Belg\u00e6, who settled in this part of the south of England, are said to have originally come. Those ancient cairns are often of larger size than most of the bar rows under consideration ; and thus they are easily distin guished from the hill-cairns, which have been raised over the bodies of single individuals by the custom of every passer by adding an additional stone. They are. also gene rally in the vicinity of oval camps, in the walls of which, arrow-heads of flint and other ancient remains are found ; and some of them contain cists of stone. Altogether indeed, making allowance for the difference of that material which is most easily found in the two countries \u2014 namely, stone in"], [321, "235 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. Scotland, and earth in Wilts and Hants, they are similar in character, and referable to people whose customs must have been, in some measure, the same. There is another reason for concluding that the hill-forts are not Roman in their origin, any more than the barrows ; ancl that is, that they are not placed as part of a system with the Roman roads, nor have the roads been made for the purpose of forming communications of any of them, exceptr ing the great and commanding ones which we know to be Roman stations. It is true, that some of them are near the Roman roads, as for example, that on Quarley hill, about six miles and a half south-west of Andover ; but even that does not appear to have had any positive connection with the road, and most likely existed long before the road was constructed. Nearly two miles south-west of Andover, the station of Bury hill, already noticed, commands a consider able portion of the valley, both of the Anton and of the Pillhill brook ; and opposite this, on the north side of the brook, there is another one, Rooksbury, upon lower ground, and approaching much more to the Roman form. In the upper part of the valley of the Test there are several others, \u2014 as Fosbuiy, nearly eight miles north-and-by-west of An dover; Walbury, on the northern height, or great line of the water-shed, about five miles north-east of Fosbury ; Beacon hill, three quarters of a mile south-west, and Ladle hill about the same distance, south-east of Burghclere ; and Winklebury, about a mile and three-quarters west-and-by north of Basingstoke. These hill-forts are a peculiar feature of the heights in this part of Hampshire, and, it is worthy of remark, that there are comparatively few barrows to the eastward of them, but a vast number to the west. From this it is pretty evident, that the forts were constructed by an invading people, who advanced westward upon the country, driving the former po pulation before them ; and that the most desperate stands against this invading people were on Salisbury plain, and on the western downs, which separate the valley of the Test ff2"], [322, "236 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. from that of the Wiltshire Avon. We have already offered a conjecture as to who those invading people were, or at least as to the part of continental Europe from which they ori ginally came ; but of the epoch of their coming, the people with whom they contended, or the length of their hostilities, we can venture to say but little. It appears, however, that these hostilities must have continued for a considerable time after the Belg\u00e6 \u2014 as we may call the early continental in vaders, had possession, and quiet possession, of the greater part of Hampshire, and probably long after they had made Winchester their capital. Thus, we obtain a sort of glance at the early history of the western and northern boundaries of the vallevs of the Test, as contested lines between hos tile tribes in times of very remote antiquity ; and this is by no means an uninteresting point in the early history of Hampshire. In times more modern, there were fewer contests for the country in this part of England. The principal one was for the establishment of Cerdic and his Saxons, whose inroad was made from the south-west; and who, therefore, took those forts in reverse, if indeed they were defended against him at all. Of his progress across the valley of the Test to Winchester, there are no certain memorials ; and, as the wealth of that city had, by the time of his inroad upon it, become the chief object of ambition in this part of the country, he probably constructed few forts of any descrip tion. In times still more modern, there was little to provoke hostilities in any part of the valley of the Test. There was no fortification in the time of Stephen, in that of the Roses, or in the wars of the Commonwealth. The only temptati ons for a conqueror, of whatever party or description he might be, were gone on the suppression of the religious houses ; and thus, though Cromwell, or some of his troops, may have, as is reported, fired a shot or two at the Abbey Church of Romsey, there was very little else in the valley of the Test, or any of its ramifications, to provoke them ; and"], [323, "237 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. the injury done to the church was so small, that Oliver, or whoever else fired the shots, merely left a little mark to show dislike of the former purposes to which that structure had been devoted. In more recent times, there has been nothing in this val ley which can be regarded as having even the slightest de gree of historical interest. While the manufactures conti nued in this part of the country \u2014 previous to the introduction of steam as the principal power, the consequent removal of the great manufactories nearer to the coal countries, and the growth of Liverpool to so extensive a port \u2014 the valley of the Test, from the abundance of water, the ease with which a moderate fall and water-power can be obtained by a compa ratively short mill-course, the fruitfulness of the country for the supply of provisions, and the safety and convenience of the Southampton Water, as its outlet to the Channel, the towns in the valley of the Test commanded a due share in the trade. But the circumstances just enumerated have caused that trade to decline, so that the manufactures are reduced to so small a fraction of their former extent as that they scarcely form a feature of the district. This has, of course, impoverished the towns in which the manufacturing was carried on ; but the decay has been gradual, and the reduction has not been attended with the same calamitous circumstances of destitution and misery of the labouring people as if it had been a sudden reverse ; indeed, it is doubtful whether the change which has taken place, is not, upon the whole, an advantage rather than a calamity. With the modern improvements, a country where the carriage of fuel, and also of materials to the manufacturer, and of goods to the market, is so expensive, the people of this district could not possibly carry on any extensive manufacturing bu siness, except at a serious loss ; or, at so scanty wages to the operatives, as would barely allow them to keep soul and body together. This is the most deplorable situation in which the whole, or any portion of a district can be placed ; and it is an evil from which no one inhabiting it can escape ;"], [324, "238 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. for, as the law of England does not allow any person willing to work to be starved to death as long as one in the locality has the means of relieving that person, any attempt to force a continuance of those declining manufactures, would have propagated the evil among the agricultural population, and the tradesmen ancl artificers necessary for their accommoda tion ; and thus brought distress and misery upon a whole country, by a vain attempt to preserve as a blessing that which would, in reality, have been a bane. Notwithstanding this decline of the manufactures and di minution of the numbers engaged in them, the valley of the Test may now, like the rest of Hampshire, be regarded as in a state of progressive improvement, slow indeed, but at the same time sure. The decline of these manufactures is owing, not to mismanagement, reverse, or particular local calamity of any kind; it is the natural result of an im proving state of the whole country \u2014 of that superior know ledge and discernment by means of which the various ma nufactures and other operations in Britain are finding their way to those places where they can be carried on with the greatest advantage to the whole. There is no question that this distribution, by procuring every article of com merce, and every necessary and convenience, at the least pos sible expense is highly advantageous to the whole country ; and, by being so, it is of necessity equally advantageous to the inhabitants of every district, and will ultimately prove so to every individual. It is in fact a part of the division of labour, and one of its most important ones. The earth, whether in its productive surface, its mines, its proximity to markets, or to any thing else, is a fellow-labourer along with man in furnishing all the necessaries and luxuries which man enjoys ; and it is just as unwise to attempt forcing the earth to do in one place that which it can do better in ano ther, as it is for man to choose that employment for which he is least fitted. Upon this principle, the people of such districts as the valley of the Test, and indeed of the county of Hants generally, may think themselves fortunate in get-"], [325, "239 THE TEST AND ITS V4<YLLEY. ting rid of all overstrained efforts to manufacture articles for distant markets, because, by being freed from this, they can devote their whole attention to their agriculture, their flocks, and those other local supplies and accommodations for which their country is so well adapted. After these general remarks upon the valley of the Test, we shall devote a short section to each of the five divisions, of which, as we have said, it consists, making such remarks as we think best upon the various scenes and subjects which they present ; and first, THE LOWER VALLEY. This, as we said, extends from the tide-way at Redbridge to Kilecomb bridge, about three miles above Stockbridge ; and, without taking the smaller windings of the river into account, it is about eighteen miles in length. In breadth it considerably exceeds the valley of the Itchen, though in some places it is not easy to decide whether the surface be longs to the one valley or to the other, as there are no branches of the rivers, by wThich the slope either way can be accurately determined. The flat of the valley, or portion capable of being turned into water-meadow by means of the river, is far more extensive than on the Itchen ; and, in some places, it is considerably more marshy. In others, however, it is laid out in corn-fields, which consist of a strong clay-loam, and yield excellent crops ; ancl, in others, it furnishes pastures of more vigorous herbage than are to be met with in many parts of the county. Generally speaking, the rise of the banks is gradual, with many late ral vallies, some of them containing rivulets; and the whole is richly wooded, and the scenery very beautiful, though never picturesque, and scarcely anywhere striking. The canal to Andover lies close under the left-hand ascent, or, at least at no great distance from it ; and there are fields, ancl villages, ancl towns between the canal and the main-channel of the river. The slopes, or grounds extending to the water-shed, vary"], [326, "240 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. considerably in breadth, both on the eastern side of the river and on the western. Eastward, the slope or flank of the valley, may be considered as averaging about five miles, and westward it is the same, though the breadth varies a great deal. So far as the valley of the Test extends, the western boundary of the county may be considered as very nearly a natural one ; for, with the exception of some trifling brooks, no water which rises in Wilts flows into this part of Hants, and none which rises in the latter county flows westward through the former. The greater part of this lower or principal valley consists of clay or gravel ; and the chalk does not make its appear ance until near Stockbridge. When treating of the valley of the Itchen we mentioned that the gravel and clay country begins near Otterbourne; and thence across to the Test, and as far as its valley extends westward ; the line of se paration between the two kinds of soil, though a very irre gular one, inclines a little to the north. As is the case on the valley of the Itchen, the lower portion is far better wooded than that which is composed of chalk, and the trees are of taller growth and more ample foliage, although few or none of them can be considered of majestic size, as com pared with trees upon deeper soil. As long as this clay and gravelly soil continues, the hills, which are but of trifling elevation, are covered with trees, or under cultivation, to the very tops ; and in many places there is a natural tendency in the soil to the growth of coppice-wood, and the hedge rows are luxuriant. In the upper part of this portion of the valley, the condition of things is very much altered. There are woods spotted over the country in various places ; and cultivated fields also occupy a considerable breadth of it; but many of the fields are poor, ancl the grass upon the downs, though kindly, is exceedingly short, and of small value as pasture. This appears to have been very much the character in ancient times, especially during the great church-building and religious-house endowing period ; for, as compared with"], [327, "241 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. those in the valley of the Itchen, and also in those of some of the upper branches of this river, churches are compa ratively few in the lower valley of the Test. In former times, a great part of it appears to have been the property of religious houses, which leads one to suppose that formerly, as well as now, it had been a district of great fertility and beauty ; as these circumstances jointly were the grounds upon which localities were chosen for monastic establish ments. The paucity of churches and villages is compen sated by the beauty of the woods, the richness of the corn fields and meadows, and the snugness of the farm-houses and cottages with which the valley is spotted, and there are also some seats in fine situations and tastefully laid out. Nutshalling, or Nursling, is the first parish church and village. It is between the Andover canal \u2014 wdiich keeps under the eastern slope, and the river, which is here about half-a mile distant from the canal. The village is small but plea santly situated ; but the parish is large, and very rich in an agricultural point of view, and the rental bears a high ratio to the number of inhabitants, the former being 3182/., and the latter 884. In the lower part of the valley, the banks have not so much elevation as to merit the name of hills, and they admit of being cultivated as far as the eastern water-shed, ancl westward to the. border of the county. From the eastern heights, ancl indeed from a great part of the high road leading from Southampton to Romsey, and thence to Salisbury, the view is rich and beautiful. There are fine fields interspersed with clumps of timber in the foreground ; the middle is extensive and well wooded, with air coming in between the several elevations, and breaking the uniformity ; and the distance finishes off with the high grounds of south Wilts and Dorset, This view is too extensive and panora mic for making a picture, unless on a large scale, and in the hands of a very superior artist ; but it is not on this account the less pleasant to look at. It not unfrequently happens that those places which are most delightful to the common observer, are least suitable to the purposes of the painter ; VOL. I. GG"], [328, "242 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. and on this acconnt, Hampshire, with all its beauty and all its richness, is by no means a picture county. Home comfort is the leading impression made by most Hampshire scenes, and it is exceedingly difficult to express this upon the canvass, though the actual contemplation of it is supe rior to that in which artists delight the most. A brook of considerable size, flowing from the nortivwest, joins the Test rather less than a mile below Nutshalling. This brook, like most of those in this part of the county, is nameless, or named from the villages and other places which it passes. It rises in Wilts, only about two miles eastward of the Avon, and has a course of some five or six miles through that county; it runs through Hampshire for about four. It drains the water of a semi-circular line, which has the ridge of Dean hill on the north, and a long extent of elevated commons on the south, with the intei'me diate shell or hollow, rich and prolifically inhabited. This part, however, is in Wilts, though strictly speaking, it be longs to the valley of the Test. The portion of it which flows through Hampshire, receives a southern branch from the borders of the New Forest, and this branch, after form ing some extent of ornamental water, in the grounds of Paulsons Park, joins the main branch about a mile from its confluence with the Test. Upon the principal branch, and near the border of the county, there is situate the parish church of East Wellow, which parish has an estimated rental of 1767/., and a population of 318. The surface of this western side of the valley is very much diversified by dale and down, and woodland, common, and corn-fields ; but its characters are too broken for presenting any leading features by which it can be described. Romsey, a market town, containing a considerable popu lation, and remarkable for the rural beauty by which it is surrounded, is the next parish in the valley of the Test. It consists of the two parishes of Romsey-extrar and Romsey infra, which contain \u2014 the first a population of 3386, and the second a population of 2046, making in all 5432.

The rental of the two is thus 6570/., or not greatly above 1/. for each individual inhabitant, which is probably less in proportion to the number of inhabitants than the valued rental of any other town in the county. This is not absolutely conclusive evidence as to the compa- rative wealth of places; because it may so happen that a few splendid mansions may increase the general rental, though the majority of the inhabitants are in humble cir- cumstances. Neither is a low rental a decided proof that the people are in a state of absolute want and suffering, be- cause there are accidental circumstances, commercial or other- wise, which give what may be called an unnatural value both to the houses and to the ground on which they are built. At Romsey there is no circumstance of this kind, \u2014 it is situated amid ample meanows, all of which are equally desirable for the purpose of residence ; and though the vi- cinity of the market-place must, in every market town, give some additional value to the immediately adjacent parts of the streets, yet in a country town such as Romsey, which is not a very great thoroughfare, or place for the deposite of goods, this cause does not tend to produce a very great increase of rent in these favourite places, above the common average of the town. That Romsey is rather large for its present business is perhaps true ; because it is much less of a business town now than it was formerly ; but still it is worthy of remark, that during the twenty years, from 1811 to 1831, the popu lation of Romsey increased from 4297 to 5432, which is an increase of 1135 individuals, or more than 26 per cent, on the gross population, which is considerably more than the average increase of the county, and nearly four times as great as the average increase of the county of Wilts. Du ring all this time too the last remains of the manufactures once carried on at Romsey has, with the exception of paper- making, been becoming extinct. Their extinguishment has, however, been so gradual, that it cannot be said to have gg2"], [332, "244 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. been productive of general suffering. This fact of the po pulation having so much increased, is a proof of this, against which it is in vain to argue from complaint or any other po pular datum ; and if one looks calmly and philosophically into the matter, one feels disposed to say that this beautiful rural town \u2014 we speak of the situation, not of the buildings, though these are better adapted to the situation than more gaudy structures would be \u2014 is in a more natural, and there fore in a more secure and healthy state at present than it was when its manufactures were most flourishing. It may have contained more wealthy inhabitants then than it does now, and money may have circulated more abundantly in it than at present; but, as the event has shown, the then state of it was not safe as respecting the general progress of the country, inasmuch as it then depended upon what con tingencies could take, and actually have taken, from it; whereas at present it depends upon the fertility of the sur rounding country, which no contingency of business can take away. The argument here is an important one, not only for Rom sey and for many other places in Hants, but for the manu facturing towns of the west of England generally, in all of which the manufactures are declining ; and we would say to the people, \" Let them go, for if yours had been the pro per situation for them, they would have remained and flourished.\" No doubt the decline of manufactures is at tended with a considerable degree of individual suffering, both to the parties engaged in them, and to such as supply these with the necessaries of life, but still were these to be forced into continuance by what would really be in fact bringing them upon the parish as paupers, the condition of the whole would be made worse, because the partial and temporary suffering would become general and continuous. Thus such a place as Romsey may be said to be in a better condition now, than if manufactures were established in it ; because manufactures could not be carried on except at a loss, and the business now done is all natural to the place,"], [333, ""], [334, "SEAT OP LORD PALMERSTON , Hit-it /tester Published tbrthe Proprietor.

The whole attention of the people is now naturally directed to local matters, grounded upon an agricultural basis, as their principal support; and, although agriculture is not so entirely under the controul of man as handicraft trade and manufactures, and probably may not have had the same scientific attention paid to it as many of these ; yet it is of more vital importance to man than all the rest put together; and though the joint powers of soil climate and management, which clothe their fields with plenty, cannot be subjected to a measure, and regulated by an index, like a steam-engine, yet they are more powerful and splendid in themselves, more delightful in their study, and more useful in their applications. Romsey is an ancient town, and appears to have been originally founded in consequence of the celebrity of its abbey ; but it never was fortified, or a place of much politi- cal importance. It also appears not to have had much commerce in early times, as it never had a \" guild \" of mer- chants ; neither was it ever a parliamentary borough, though Stockbridge, which is not even a parish, possessed that pri- vilege. It has, however, a regular corporation for its fiscal government, consisting of a mayor, a recorder, six aldermen, twelve burgesses or councillors, and the usual appointment of officers. The town-hall, situated on the place of the for- mer abbey, is used for the petty sessions for the Romsey division of the hundred ; and here also the poll is taken for the members of South Hants \u2014 the principal return court for them being at Southampton. The corn-market, which is held every Thursday, is well supplied and attended ; and, on every second Thursday, there is a market for live sheep and hogs. There are also three fairs in the year, for the sale of horses, cattle, and other rural productions and appoint ments. County produce of every kind is plentiful; and the gardens, in and about the town, are very productive. Like the other towns situated in the valleys of the south-"], [336, "246 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. running rivers in this part of England, Romsey is plenti fully supplied with water of the finest quality, both for every domestic purpose, and for giving motion both to the corn and paper-mills. The main branch of the Test passes to the westward of the town, and a smaller branch near the centre divides Romsey-extra from Romsey-infra. The An dover canal also passes it no great distance within the east ern extremity of the town, affording convenient wharfage for coals, timber, slate, lime, and other Avater-borne commo dities ; and, as this lies upon rather a higher level than the town \u2014 at least the north-eastern part of it, it could supply it with water, were that necessary. Indeed, streams and water-courses are so distributed through the meadows to the north of Romsey, that these meadows are, in great part, di vided into islands. The various branches of the Test unite into a single channel, the canal excepted, in the park at Broadlands, the seat of Lord Palmerston, where they afford an ample supply of ornamental water. This park extends down the river about a mile and a quarter ; it is of an irregular triangular shape ; and the side which abuts on Romsey, is about half a-mile in length. This park is very finely wooded, some of the trees are of stately growth, ancl they are grouped with taste. The house is of considerable dimensions; but plain and simple, and therefore well-adapted to the rich quiet of its situation. The different families to whom this mansion and vicinity have belonged, have paid considerable attention to the town of Romsey. For two centuries it belonged to the family of St. Barbe, one of whom represented the coun ty of Southampton in Cromwell's parliament ; and it came into the hands of the Temple or Palmerston family about the middle of the last century. The width of the valley of the Test, is here about three-quarters of a mile from the begin ning of the rise on the one side to that of the other ; but above Romsey it extends westward into a sort of basin, and again widens westward opposite the middle of the length of Broad-"], [337, ""], [338, "VALLtET \u00a9 E TTIHE TEST. .. \u25a0 . \u25a0\u2022 Street. \u25a0 . ' \u25a0"], [339, "247 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. lands. Between these widenings it is narrowed by beautifully swelling hills. One of them forming a sloping lawn to ward the meadows, and the other standing out like a natu ral fort, and having marks of artificial fortification upon all except its steepest sides. The summit is remarkably flat, and covered with a carpeting of grass, with wild thyme and other aromatic herbage, as soft as velvet ; and, during the warmth of a fine summer-day, the air over it is radiant with wings, and vocal with the hum of insects. The views from the top of this hill are exceedingly beau tiful, and their beauty is much heightened by their being parted from each other by clumps of trees, which are very judiciously placed, some on the brow of the steep, and others on the margin of the summit. Of these views there are principally four, though each of them may be varied into many, by the spectator shifting his ground on the hill. First, toward one's rightrhand, there is the view down the valley and across the Southampton Water to the New7 Forest, and, we believe, in favourable states of the atmo sphere, to the Isle of Wight ; this is a charming view to look at, especially when a gentle south-west wind is making the clouds play at light and shadow upon it ; but it is too rich and extensive for description. Still, a stranger who wishes to estimate the beauty of really English scenery, should come to this hill. Secondly, and to the left of the first, there is the view of Broadlands, which is, however, less stiff and formal when taken from the southern slope ; and accordingly our artist selected that spot for his represen tation. Thirdly, there is the view of Romsey ; but, as the abbey church, the most characteristic feature of the town, is rather too distant, and there is a little too much of a bird's-eye character in the view, our artist preferred a spot on the descent of the other hill toward the meadows. The fourth view is that up the valley of the Test, which valley here assumes the appearance of an amphitheatre, with fine ly-wooded margins ; the clear streams glittering among fields of the freshest verdure ; but with a blasted and barkless"], [340, "248 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. trunk, here and there, as if to put one in mind that the place is old, notwithstanding its fresh and youthful appear appearance. This view is also better if taken from the hill, or sloping bank, farther to the left, near the turnstile where the footpath enters the Salisbury road ; and along this road until it descends the first elevation, there are some beautiful peeps of this valley of the Test. From the top of the entrenched hill backwards, or toward the west, there is no view of any consequence ; but south wards, across a dell, there is a wooded scene near at hand, which approximates the picturesque as much as most \"bits\" to be met with on the mainland of Hampshire. Westward there are commons and downs, interrupted only by the nar row valley of the nameless brook which passes near East Wellow, formerly alluded to ; and this hill at Romsey \u2014 Pouncefoot hill,- we believe \u2014 may be regarded as the ter mination of this elevated ridge, to which there is nothing exactly answering on the opposite side of the Test ; though there, also, the surface of the country is very much diversi fied. Upon that side, about two miles south-east of Rom sey, there is the elevation of Toot hill, to the east of which there are some ancient entrenchments; and upon looking from Romsey, that is from the entrenched hill of which we are speaking, the whole of the heights from Toot hill to Cranbury, across which the Roman road from Nutshalling to Winchester led, are pleasantly diversified. But, inte resting as this hill is \u2014 and any lover of natural beauty might spend the longest summer-day upon it with great pleasure \u2014 we must take our leave of it, and again return to the town. Romsey \u2014 antiently spelled Romesyg, evidently implies that there had been a passage of the Test here, before any bridge was constructed; and that the banks of the river, which appears then to have flowed in an eastern and a west ern division, had been covered with sedges. It is also high ly probable that, in early times, the amphitheatric portion of the valley above Romsey, some mile and a quarter upwards"], [341, "THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. 249 to Timsbury bridge, had then been a lake or pool, or, at all events, a very humid marsh ; and, that the slightly-elevated ground upon which part of Romsey and of the park of Broadlands now stand, had then been an island. Part of the meadows have still a good deal of a marshy character ; and one of the old colloquial names of the place is \"Romsey in the mud ;\" but the mud has been consolidated, and now forms a soil upon which trees, natural grasses, and cultivat ed plants thrive with equal luxuriance. That Romsey was a place of some importance in very early times, at least for the passage of the river, is proved by the number of roads which converge upon it from many directions. The roads from Poole and Salisbury enter on the west, those from Southampton and Winchester on the east ; and there is one road from the lower valley, and ano ther from the upper. The junction of the Poole and Salis bury roads on the west is just about a mile from that of the Southampton and Winchester roads on the east ; and this distance, though it has a zig-zag northward about the middle of the town, is, for the greater part, continuously bent. Ano ther street leads up the valley, which is again crossed about the middle, and also near its northern extremity. The town is thus irregular and straggling ; but not on that account the less in accordance with its situation. Besides the fiscal and other institutions alluded to, Rom sey possesses a Literary and Scientific Institute : a means of instruction which it did not possess when it was a manufac turing town. At that time, however, it gave birth to men who raised themselves to no inconsiderable eminence ; and, among the rest, to Sir William Petty, the founder of the Lansdowne family. Sir William is a character of some note in history, and was equally remarkable for his industry, for the versatility of his talents, and for his success in accu mulating wealth. His father was a cloth-manufacturer, which was at that time the foremost occupation in the town ; and his talents were first displayed in mechanical dexterity, then in languages, next in surgery and in ship-building; and VOL. I. HH"], [342, "250 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. after this he was professor of anatomy in Oxford, and a member of the Royal College of Physicians. The rise and fall of political systems appear to have contributed equally to the success of Sir William Petty. He was in office during the Commonwealth, and he received the ceremony of knighthood from Charles II. Along with his other acquire ments, he was so profoundly skilled in Political Economy, that he was regarded as one of those who mainly contribut ed to the elaboration of that congeries of dogmas and puz zles into something like a regular science. Nor was he less an adapt in what may be termed private economy ; for he contrived to accumulate a fortune of about 15,000/. a year, which was no common matter in those days, and has in all ages been rare among men of so great and so various talents as Sir William Petty. Some other eminent individuals have been born in Romsey ; but Sir William Petty throws all the rest into the shade \u2014 out of which we have no time to bring them. As Romsey Abbey was probably the first cause of the formation or gathering of the town, so the Abbey Church is still the most conspicuous, and to visitors the most interest ing, object in it. It is a large, handsome, and interesting structure, beautifully situated in the north-west quarter of the town, open to the meadows, and therefore well seen from the western bank and hill to which we have already alluded. The church, as it now stands, was of course only an appendage to the abbey, or rather nunnery, which for merly gave importance to the place, and held nearly the same rank among nunneries that the Winchester cathedral did among monasteries, \u2014 that is to say, it was the most richly endowed, and persons of the highest rank were ap pointed to, or desirous of becoming, its superintendents. At its foundation, and for some time after, the abbess and nuns of this establishment appear to have conducted them selves with decorum. The abbesses were then the daugh ters, the sisters, or other near relatives of kings ; and some of them, if they did not actually earn saintship, had it"], [343, "251 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. bestowed upon them, \u2014 which amounted to the same thing in the calendar. In later times, however, the fine gold of their saintship waxed dim ; for, in the early part of the six teenth century, Bishop Fox, on his visitation, found it ne cessary to threaten the abbess with the ban of the church, for keeping late hours, indulging in strong liquors, and en ticing the rest of the sisterhood to follow her example. This abbey was founded by Edward the Elder, about the year 930 ; and his daughter Elfrida was appointed the first abbess. . Whether any portion of the church \u2014 the only part of the abbey which remains \u2014 is as old as the time of this Edward, or whether Saxon at all, is a point for antiquaries to settle. Sixty-two years after its foundation, it was plun dered by the Danes ; but the abbess had previously con veyed the sainted bones, the nuns, and other articles of real or imaginary value, to a place of safety at Winchester. Whatever may have been the character of the first erection here, it is probable that it suffered much at this time, and very likely it had to be re-built, though the eastern part of the church, if not absolutely Saxon, is certainly of very early Norman architecture. Edward the Confessor had a cousin a nun here, who educated Matilda, princess of Scot land, afterwards queen to Henry I, and it may be, that about this time, great part of what remains of the structure was built. The last royal abbess of Romsey was Mary, the daughter of King Stephen, who eloped with the son of the earl of Flanders ; and after this catastrophe, we believe that no succeeding abbess of Romsey was entered on the calen dar as a saint ; but on the progress of the frailty of the sis terhood, from the piety of St. Elfrida, to the potations of J oise Rous, the historians are silent; such delineations not being exactly in accordance with the taste of the chroniclers of monastic times. In common with the rest of houses of this description, the abbey of Romsey was dissolved by Henry VIII ; at which time its revenues were considerable, amounting, according to some of the authorities, to between 300/. and 400/., and HH 2"], [344, "252 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. according to others to between 500/. and 600/. After the dissolution, the king sold the church to the inhabitants for 100/., ancl it has been used as the parish church ever since. When the dormitories, refectories, cloisters, and other build ings of the abbey or nunnery \u2014 which as usual were situated to the south of the church, were dilapidated, does not appear on any specific record, but scarcely a vestige of them now remains. The church however is in a state of comparative perfection ; and of its kind, it is a large and handsome struc ture, and well worth visiting. As is usual with such churches, it is built in the form of a cross, composed of a nave and chancel in the east and west direction ; and two transepts cross-ways, with a tower at the intersection ; and eastward of the tower there are additions or chapels of cir cular outline, in the angles formed by the chancel and the transepts. The church is situated on the southern side of a rather extensive cemetry of slightly elevated ground, covered with fine grass, and presenting no appearance of ever having been under water. The west front of the nave is of com manding aspect, and before it there is a spot of green taste fully laid out with shrubs ancl flowers, and along this green there flows one of the ramifications of the Test. It is from this front, or rather from the south-west angle, that one obtains the best exterior view of the whole building. The angles of the front are suppoi'ted by buttresses, ending in simple slopes without any pinnacles, with a large pointed arch rising as high at the vertex as the buttresses ; and three lancet-headed windows, the middle one larger than the others, with a quatrefoil window toward the top of the arch, and a circular opening above in the pediment of the roof. The roof, which is covered with lead, has been successively lowered, as there are cheveron markings in the walls of the tower, showing two former roofs, the one higher than the other, but both pitched above the present one. The tower is large and massive, in the Norman character, with a leaden roof surmounted by a wooden belfry in which there is a peal of eight bells. This tower is accessible by a stair of 151"], [345, "a:... /,,.!,, /\u25a0\u201e,:,, ./\u201e\u25a0,/ ta, ,/,, J;,,/.,,.,,, ,.,-,.,, .\u201e./.y. street, .

I"], [346, ""], [347, "253 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. steps, situated in the south-west angle ; and there are gal leries formed in the walls, leading round great part of the interior. The architecture of the whole pile is ancient and very fine, but our limits forbid us from entering into parti culars. The nave is parted off by an ancient oaken screen of rather tasteful workmanship, and over this there is a crimson curtain extending to the top of the arch that sup ports the tower, so that there is no internal view extending the whole length. This, in a pictorial sense, is to be regret ted, as the interior of the eastern part is very rich and beau tiful ; and if not actually Saxon, it is certainly amongst the oldest, finest, and best-preserved specimens of Norman architecture in England. As matters are arranged, there is no possibility of getting to such a distance as that even the whole height of the east wall can be seen at one view ; and so the visiter has no alternative but to examine the parts in detail, putting them together as he best may. From the platform by the altar, the view is better, only it terminates with the curtain ; and this suggests the idea of having the curtain drawm. But this parting of the length of the inte rior adds much to the comfort of the church as a place of worship, which is a matter of far greater importance than mere pictorial effect. The pews are modern, and the whole fittings-up are commodious and rather handsome. There are a desk and other accomodations for the performance of the funeral service, in the portion of the nave westward of the screen ; and a part of the south aisle is parted off, and used for Sunday and other schools. Besides the parish church, there are in Romsey, chapels belonging to the Independents, Baptists, and Wesleyans. Dissenters are indeed of long standing in the town ; for in 1666, Mr. Thomas Warren, upon being ejected from the rectory of Houghton, for non-conformity, opened a chapel in Romsey, in which he continued to officiate, when he was old and blind, notwithstanding the offers made to him by Charles, of preferment in the Church, and even of the bishopric of Salisbury, if he would conform. But Warren"], [348, "254 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. remained stedfast in what he believed to be the truth, not withstanding these temptations, and his bones rest in the southern transept of Romsey church, beneath a flat stone, with a simple but not un-appropriate inscription. There are many monuments in different parts of the church, both of ancient and of modern date, and it is not a little remarkable, that the greatest man ever born in Romsey, has his last earthly abode superscribed by these words, \" Here layes Sir William Petty.\" Some of those who have been subsequent ly commemorated in more pompous style, might perchance have been more appropriately remembered, if their friends had paused and read the epitaph of Petty, before they chi selled the marble and turned the eulogy. In the nine miles of the valley from Romsey to Stockbridge, there are many more churches in proportion then there are below ; and the valley itself, though narrower, is perhaps more beautiful, as the outlines of the banks are of a bolder character. The clay and gravel continue for a part of this distance, and in them there are a few rivulets, but they are small and nameless. The first parish above Romsey is Timsbury, about two miles distant, and the church is situated near the banks of the river. This is an agricultural parish in which the population bears a small proportion to the ren tal, the former being 165 and the latter 1302/. About a mile farther, upon the same side and more distant from the river, are Michelmarsh, Elton, Farley, and Ashley, situated on the downs, where the population is trifling, and the sur face for the most part poor and bleak, as it is here that the chalky downs commence. The downs are indeed covered with patches of wood in many places ; but this is not upon the whole one of the most interesting parts of the county. The western side of the valley is more pleasing, as it con sists more of hill and dale. At nearly four miles above Rom sey is situated Mottisfont, where there is a considerable vil lage, and once was a priory ; which was built in the reign of King John, and had a revenue of more than 160/. at the suppression. This establishment made no great figure in"], [349, "255 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. monastic history ; and Henry the Seventh had procured a. bull for its suppression, which however was not put in force until the other establishments of the kind were suppressed along with it. Mottisfont House, now the property of a ba ronet-family of the name of Mill, stands on part of the site of the priory, and some portion of it is of considerable anti quity. The grounds are naturally rich and beautiful ; and upwards of a million and a quarter of trees were planted on the estates in the thirty years preceding 1820. Some of the old trees are very stately, and altogether the place is a fine one. Immediately to the south of this mansion, a small ri vulet comes in from the west, flowing through a long pass in the downs, from a source not above two miles from the Avon. The length of the rivulet may be about eight miles ; and along its banks a canal was attempted, from the Test to Salisbury ; but, from deficiency of water at the summit, want of trade, or some other cause it has fallen into disuse. Only about half this brook passes through Hampshire, the boundary of the county passing through the straggling village of West Dean, but the church of that parish is in Wilts. East Dean, about a mile and a quarter east, is a parish with a rental of about 1000/. ancl a population of 170, ancl still nearer the Test, is the parish of Lockerley, with a popula tion of 560 and a rental of only 221/. which is lower in pro portion to the population than almost any other parish in the county. On the north side of this brook, and distant from it and from each other, about a mile ancl a half or two miles, there are the parishes of East and West Tytherley : the first parish having a rental of above 1700/. and a population of about 300 ; and the second having a rental of about 2400/. and a population of 500. Bossington, situated near to where the old Roman way crosses the Test, is the next parish on the left bank of the river. The rental in it bears a very high ratio to the population, being about 1000/. while there are not 50 inhabitants. A little to the north of Bossington another brook joins the Test, This brook flows through the high"], [350, "256 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. downs by the villages of Upper, Middle, and Lower Wallop, and-Broughton; all of which are parish villages with the ex ception of Middle Wallop. These are extensive parishes, though the surface is in general bare and the climate keen. Upper Wallop contains 478 people with a valued rental of 3497/., Lower Wallop has 900 people and a rental of up wards of 600/. At Broughton there is a village of conside rable size and some antiquity, at which an annual fair is held in July. The rental of the parish is 1669/. and the popula tion 897. Immediately east of Broughton and near the bank of the Test, the parish of Houghton or North Hough ton \u2014 of considerable extent, but of no great rental or popula tion \u2014 lies on the chalky downs, which are however, in some places cultivated. On the opposite side of the river there are the parishes of Little Somborne, which is on the eastern downs, and contains only 84 inhabitants ; and, between this and the river, King's Somborne, a more extensive parish, but still not rich, having a rental of 3700/. and upwards of 1000 inhabitants. The borough of Stockrridge, situated where the Win chester ancl Salisbury road crosses the Test, is a hamlet of the last-named parish \u2014 not being a parish in itself, though previous to the passing of the Reform Bill it was a parlia mentary borough. It is of considerable importance as a thoroughfare, but of no great interest as a town. Its govern ment consists of a bailiff, a constable, and a sergeant-at-mace. The population of Stockbridge by the last return is 851, which is an increase of 30 per cent in the last thirty years. This seems to be no proof that the town is declining as is usually said, but that on the other hand it is partaking of the gradual improvement of the rest of the county. Stock bridge lies in what may be considered a narrow or pass of the valley, which is here only about half-a-mile from the ascent on the one side to that on the other ; and the principal houses in the town are built stragglingly along this distance, with a number of small bridges to admit passage to the streams into which the river is divided. The name Stockbridge"], [351, "257 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. implied that there was once a passage here upon or by means of \" stocks,\" or stakes of timber ; but it might bear a modern etymology from the stock of bridges which a travel ler sees in passing along the street- Above Stockbridge, on the west bank of the river, there is the parish church and straggling village of Longstock, with a population of 428, and a valued rental of 3337/. ; and on the opposite bank there is the parish of Leckford, with 221 people, and 2568/. rent. The immediate vicinity of the river is fertile, but high and bleak downs approach it closely on each side, \u2014 Longstock hill on the west, and a continuation of downs as far eastward as nearly to the Win chester and Basingstoke road. These parishes bring us to Kilecomb bridge, where the Anton joins the Test; and the Andover canal, which has hitherto kept the east or left bank of the Test, crosses over to the right bank of the Anton : and this terminates the lower valley of the river. VALLEY OF THE ANTON. This valley occupies the north-west part of the county, with the exception of what lies to the north of the great chalk ridge sloping toward Berkshire. It is of an irre gular oval figure, about twelve miles in extreme extent from east to west, and about ten from north to south. Ge nerally speaking, the natural boundaries of it are pretty well defined by summit-levels of the chalk elevations ; but the county of Hants extends beyond these in some places, and falls short of them in others. The hundreds of Andover and Wherwell take up nearly the whole of it, except a small portion on the west, which is in the hundred of Thorngate, which last hundred occupies all the west march of the county, from the New Forest northward, to the Devil's Ditch, an entrenchment extending about a mile and a half from Beacon hill, in a part of the county wThere there has been much fighting at some period of its history, as there are many barrows to the westward both of the hill ancl the ditch. The ditch is in Wilts, and so is the VOL. I. I I"], [352, "258 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. greater part of the hill, but Hampshire touches on the north eastern slope of it ; and thus this hill is a good point of re ference for positions in this part of the county. The Beacon hill ridge extends northward, in an irregular curve; and, about two miles to the east, there is another ridge, which forms the proper boundary of the valley of the Anton. Between these ridges, there flows a small branch of the Wiltshire Avon, which has a very long course but very little water, and is often entirely dry in the summer months for almost the whole upper course. This is the Winterbourne, which gives part of the name to four parishes to the north east of Salisbury; ancl it joins the Avon at that city. Its name is, of course, derived from its seasonal character. About three miles in length of this valley, from the small inn at Park-house, on the Andover and Amesbury road, is in Hampshire, though not naturally within the valley of the Anton. There are many heights in this part of the county, but the valley yields good crops, though the land is, in general, light and chalky. This valley contains the parishes of Shipton and Little Tidworth, \u2014 the church of the former being about a mile to the north of the part where the boun dary of the county crosses the Amesbury road; and that of the latter about a mile and a half further up the valley. It is worthy of remark, that there are few or no barrows upon this side of the Beacon hill ridge, though there are very many on the other side ; and this is a further proof of the conjecture which we have already hazarded \u2014 that the hill-forts and lines of entrenchment, which are so numerous in this part of the country, were works of a people in possession of the country to the east and south-east/ to pre vent the inroads ofa western people. The encampments of the lines always face the westward ; and as the places of sepulture are in front and in rear of the lines, the occupiers of the fortified places must have gone out to meet the enemy, and not waited the attack in their strongholds ; and, though some of these remains are named after the Danes, at least"], [353, "259 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. in common parlance \u2014 one barrow being named after Canute, although he died in peace, not in battle, and was interred in the cathedral of Winchester. With the exception of such as are Roman, or of much more modern date than even their times, the whole of the works and places of interment, which are so numerous on the western border of Hants and the adjoining part of Wilts, must therefore be referred to a period anterior to that of the Romans ; and they are evi dently the works of a people who wished to protect them selves against inroads from the north and west, directions in which none of the sea-borne invaders came into this part of England. Consequently they are the works of the earliest invaders \u2014 of the Belg\u00e6, as before hinted, when these had established themselves in Hants, and so improved it as to tempt the cupidity of the more barbarous natives of the country inland. With the exception of this detached valley \u2014 and the boun dary makes a flexure westward, in order to take it in \u2014 the valley of the Anton can be traced, in a continuous succes sion of heights, from Longstock hill, on the west of its con fluence with the Test, round to the heights of Harewood Forest, to the eastward of the same. It is not, however, a regular basin or circular valley, but consists of several hol lows, separated from each other by irregular masses of al ternating dell and down, with very little valley land properly so called, or flat land of any description. It is also only a branch valley ; for, along the north-east ancl east, the Test is between it and the great northern height of the county. The principal hollows in it are spread out something like a hand, in position, but not in number ; though it would be a far-fetched etymology, as well as giving the people of old credit for more topographical knowledge than they actually possessed, to suppose that this was the origin of the name. The names of rivers, when they have proper names, not de rived from some place or some obvious quality, are among the greatest puzzles that the describer of a country meets. If the name is \" Bourne,\" or \" Avon,\" or \" Esk,\" wTe know ii 2"], [354, "260 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. that it is simply \" the running water ;\" and if it is \" Stour,\" or \" Ouse,\" we infer that its current or its channel is muddy ; but beyond this it is not very safe to trace etymologies. It may, however, be mentioned, that such of the names of rivers as can be traced, whether in England or in Scotland, are of Celtic origin, so that they must have been objects of interest before a people of any other language came into the country. But, with the exception of those of the rivers, and the named ones are few, there are not many names of British or Celtic origin in Hampshire. Taking Andover as a central part, the valley of the Anton extends westward between seven and eight miles, northward about six, eastward between two and three, and southward about four ; but this is true of the mean summit-level only, as the gravel surface slopes in a variety of directions. The opening into the valley of the Anton, between Longstock hill and the heights west of Wherwell, is not above a mile in breadth, and the flat or meadow part is not more than a quarter-of-a-mile. Above this it extends, forming a long oval basin, which has the appearance of having at one time been a lake, but that time must have been a very early one. The water-meadows in this basin have a breadth of about half-a/ mile ; but they narrow again near the villages of Clatford, at rather more than two miles above the junction with the Test. There are three Clatfords \u2014 Lower Clatford on the west of the river, Goodworth Clatford on the east and a very little further up ; and Upper Clatford about a mile higher. The latter two are parish villages ; and the parishes extend on the eastern downs as far as Harewood Forest. Good worth Clatford has a rental of about 1800/. and a population of more than 400 ; and Upper Clatford has a rental of near ly 2600/. and contains about 500 people. About half-a-mile higher than Upper Clatford, the Pillhill brook comes in from the west, flowing along a pleasant little valley, in which there are six parish churches, all near to each other, ancl a considerable number of inhabitants. The whole course of the brook is about six or seven miles ; and"], [355, "261 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. as is the case with most brooks in the chalk districts, it has very few branches. The Amesbury and Andover road crosses it at Mollens' pond, about four miles and a half to the west of Andover ; and immediately to the north of the road, there is the very pleasant little village and church of Thruxton, ancl embowered among the trees, a considerable pond of water, a rare sight in this part of the county. Thruxton contains 269 inhabitants, ancl has a valued rental of 1400/. There are three parish churches very near to each other here : for Fifield is only half-a-mile north of Thruxton, and Kimpton a mile west of Fifield. Fifield however, reckons only as a hamlet we believe ; and its population is returned at only 13. Kimpton, on the other hand, has a population of 383, and a rental of more than 2000/. The main stream of the brook comes down by Kimpton and Fifield ; but in the summer months it is very insignificant. Three churches occupy a little dell of very pleasant agricultural country, surrounded by clowns ; but everywhere susceptible of cul ture. Amport, Monkston, and Abbot's Ann, are the three remaining parishes in the Pillhill brook valley ; ancl wTest of them are Quarley and Grateleij : the latter lying north of Over Wallop, ancl separated from it by downs. Abbot's Ann, in the lower part of the valley, is the richest parish, Its rental is 3757/. ancl its population 562. Monkston has 1438/. ren tal, and 276 inhabitants. Amport, which contains a long ancl straggling village, has 713 inhabitants ; but the rental is only 1655/. which is less than the half of that of Abbot's Ann. Quarley, which is more on the downs, has only 200 people, and the rental is about 700/. Grately is also much on the downs, and has a population of 130 ; and a rental of 1035/. The valley of this little brook is no bad epitome of the whole of those parts of Hampshire which lie on the chalk. Quarley mount, at its western extremity, is light, bleak, and marked with encampments and entrenchments ; and taking the district here to Abbot's Ann, there is every gradation from dry clown to water meadow. The main stream of the Anton, which is, however, shorter"], [356, "262 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. than the Pillhill brook, runs about two miles to the north of this, with an elevated down intervening, and upon this the village of Weyhill stands, which has been so long celebrated for its fair. Weyhill is three miles west from Andover, and only .two miles south of an angle of Wilts, which projects into this part of Hampshire, and occupies part of the ground sloping to the Anton, and naturally included in the valley. Weyhill is within the parliamentary boundary of Andover, and the fair is under the jurisdiction of the borough magis trates. This fair is not of very ancient date, having been chartered to the corporation of Andover in the forty-first year of Elizabeth. There used to be a festivity of the peo ple of Andover upon Weyhill, on the Sunday preceding Michaelmas, and the fair was instituted in place of it. It used to be a fair of great resort and a great deal of business ; and though, like all public fairs, it has fallen off a great deal in the numbers, and still more in the quality of those who attend, it is still one of the greatest fairs in England, and a good deal of business is transacted at it. It commences on the day before Michaelmas, which is the principal sheep market ; and when the fair was in the height of its glory as many as 140,000 were sometimes sold on this day, besides a continuation on the other days of the fair. Next day the agricultural labourers are hired; and after this the sale of hops, in which there is a large trade, is commenced. Farn ham hops being in most esteem, the venders of them have a named \" Row \" in the fair ; and there are various stations for the others, who are not allowed to vend their wares in \"Farnham Row.\" Horses, country produce, utensils, cloths, cheese, and an endless list of other articles are also brought to this mart, which lasts for an unlimited number of days, and is quite a rural Saturnalia in its way. During its con tinuance the Bailiff of Andover holds a pied-poudre, or \"dusty-foot,\" court, for the settling of disputes and the punishment of minor delinquencies ; and a fee is paid to the borough for each booth or standing. As preparatory for this great fair on Weyhill, there is one held on the pre-"], [357, "263 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. ceding day at Appleshaw, about two miles north-west. Though Weyhill Fair is held only once a year, yet the accommodations are in part kept up all the year round. These consist of huts, booths, and covered-ways, which afford shelter in case of bad weather ; and there are others opened as taverns and suttling-houses. In former times, when inter course between the different parts of the country was slow and limited compared to what it is now, and when the faci lities of obtaining commodities were much less, these public fairs were a great accommodation to the people generally ; and there are still many articles of country growth, espe cially animals, for which they are very convenient ; but in so far as they tend to collect the profligate and encourage idleness, they are objectionable. The borough of Andover, of which we shall afterwards speak, is situated at the eastern extremity of the down upon which Weyhill Fair is held ; and, immediately to the north ward of the borough, the several brooks which form the Anton, are collected into one channel in the meadows called Andover marsh. From this meadow the ground rises gra dually on all sides, except at the town where the river finds a passage southward. It must be borne in mind that, in dry weather, there is no running stream near the water shed, in any part of the chalky districts ; and that thus the permanent names for the minute ramifications are hollows, not brooks, though there is water in some part of those ramifications of the Anton at all times of the year. The largest of them is that to the north of Weyhill, which has its course or channel through the parishes of Appleshaw, Penton Mewsey, and Foxcote, the churches of which are at no great distance from each other, which is evidence of a fertile district of country, and a district which had been cul tivated in early times. Appleshaw lies higher on the slope than either of the others, and has a rental of 1433/. and a population of 356; Penton Mewsey has 1388/. rental, and 254 inhabitants ; and Foxcote is, we believe, only a hamlet. The northern and eastern brooks of the Anton, are much"], [358, "264 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. shorter than this one, and they have not many villages col lected upon them ; as it is not the mere hollows, but the per manent supply of water, which induces the people to collect themselves into villages. There is one little brook which flows about a mile and a half, from Enham Knight's south to Andover; and another from the eastern heights near Dole's wood, which passes the small village of East Anton. En ham Knight's is a parish with a population of 123, and a rental of 770/. The only remaining parish in the valley of the Anton, is that of Tangley, in the northern part, and it lies among the streamless downs, near the borders of Wilts; and has 282 inhabitants, and a rental of 1203/. The heights to the eastward, between the Anton and the Test, are not broken by the beds of rivulets, or by cross hol lows, but consist of a pretty uniform slope to the river on each side. Great part of the summit is wood-land consist ing of Harewood Forest in the south, and Dole's wood in the north: the latter occupying about three miles of the line, and the former seven, so that the two between them take up fully half of the whole length of this side of the valley. Whe ther these were, in the olden time, woods, with a low space between them, as is the case now, we have no means of as certaining ; but it is probable that such was the case, as here again there is a \" Devil's Ditch,\" or entrenchment, extend ing across a considerable portion of the opening ; and from the position of this, it appears, like all the others, to be a defence against the west. Two Roman roads intersected each other in the valley of the Anton, or rather on the eastern heights \u2014 the road from Winchester to Cirencester in one direction, and that from Old Sarum to Silchester in ano ther. The first of these is called the \" Portway on the Eastern Heights ;\" and it passes near the entrenchment above alluded to, but without having had any apparent con nexion with it, as part of the same system of works. There are several residences of country gentlemen in this part of Hampshire ; but there are no large parks or splendid man sions. It is especially a rural district, composed in great"], [359, ""], [360, "ENVIRONS OF ANDOVER. IMnj^f.i-ter-TPubhshed. for t?w Proprietor.

The high lands are thin, and the crops upon them are consequently light, but they are good in quality ; and the climate, though cold in winter, is very healthy. BOROUGH OF ANDOVER. Andover may be regarded as the natural capital of its own hundred, and indeed of the whole valley of the Anton ; and of other parts of the north, both of Hants and of Wilts. It is the nearest market-town for a considerable tract of agricultural and sheep country ; and it is well situated in respect to lines of communication with other places. There are principal roads converging upon Andover from very many directions. The great mail-coach road from London to Salisbury and Poole passes through it ; another proceeds through Amesbury to North Wilts, and all the country on the Bristol Channel ; a third leads to Newbury and the centre of England ; a fourth to Ringwood and the New Forest ; a fifth down the valley of the Anton and Test ; and a sixth across the downs to Winchester and Southampton : making, in the whole, six principal lines, all of them leading to places of importance. Besides these, there are very many minor roads, which afford free and general communication between Andover and that district of which he have de scribed it as being the natural capital ; ancl, in addition to all these roads, there is, by means of the canal, a com munication with the sea at Redbridge. This must always secure to it a very considerable degree of buslte and activity, country trade, and support from those travelling through it, The situation, too, is pleasant, and the country on every side is abundant ; and consequently, the provision market is al ways well supplied. The situation of Andover is such, and the lines of main road which meet at it so many, that it is less likely to be affected by the railroads, even supposing them to reduce the traffic upon common roads, as much as VOL. I. KK"], [362, "266 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. their most interested supporters hope, than most other towns. Of the ancient state of Andover, very little is known, though it is probable that the vicinity of it was thickly peopled in very remote times. Before the conquest, it was royal property. According to the accounts, it was here that Analf the Dane made that bargain not to fight again with the English, which the Danes did not keep. It may also be that Ethelred's mother was sometimes here, before she founded the abbey at Wherwell, and there did penance for the sins of her youth, which were not few in number, and not small in enormity. At the time the Doomsday Book was drawn up, Andover was rated as having six mills, and pannage for a hundred hogs in the adjoining forest ; but this, of course, related to the district, not to the town. It is generally un derstood, that Andover became a corporate town at least as early as the reign of King John ; but the charter of its holding was no more ancient than the time of Elizabeth ; and it returned no member to parliament from 1307 to 1585. After this, it returned two members. The govern ment of the town is vested in a bailiff, steward, recorder, two assistants to the bailiff, and councillors ; and the right of voting for the two members of parliament is common to the town and a considerable extent of the surrounding liberty. In shape, it bears some resemblance to an ivy leaf, with the point to the east, upon the London road, within a short distance of the Test, the south-east and north-east sides are each nearly four miles long, and not very far from straight lines. The other three sides measure between two and three miles each ; and the north-west and south-west ones are waving. The extreme length from east to west is about four miles and a half; and the area about eleven or twelve square miles. This is considerably larger than the parliamentary extent of Winchester, Southampton, or Ports mouth, and it is also greater than that of Lymington, but less than either Christchurch or Petersfield, the rural parts of which are so considerable, that they resemble little coun-"], [363, "A W ID \u00ae V E 18 .

In respect of their parliamentary extent, there is a regular gradation among the Hampshire boroughs ; Newport in the Isle of Wight is the least, Winchester the next ; after that Southampton ; then Portsmouth, which does not include Gosport ; then come Lymington, and Andover, and Peters field, and Christchurch, which last are nearly of the same dimensions. The population as afterwards to be noticed, is even below that of the parish, exclusive of the out parishes. According to the census in 1831, the inhabitants of Ando ver town and parish amounted to 4843, being an increase of about 46 per cent, during the preceding thirty years, which is a greater increase than of any other borough in the county, except Southampton, in which the population has increased 137 per cent, in the same period. The increase of Andover has arisen from greater traffic passing through it, as well as from the general improvement of its district ; and for the reasons already mentioned, the prosperity of the town is very likely to go on. The town is irregular, consisting of streets along the great thoroughfares which meet at an open Space, or kind of square, near the centre. In the upper part of this square, facing the London road, stands the Town Hall, with a piazza under, which forms a commodious mar ket place; as it is airy, and at the same time well sheltered from the rain. The church is as old as the reign of the Conqueror; and its size would lead to the conclusion that the place was populous even then. It has a nave, aisles, a chancel and north transept, with a Norman tower over the centre, and a neat door-way at the west end. William, part of whose policy consisted in Normanising the religious es tablishments as much as possible, bestowed this one upon an abbey in the province of Anjou, who held it for about three centuries and a half, \u2014 indeed, until the suppression of the alien priories, by Henry the Fifth; and then it was given to St. Mary's College, at Oxford. The town contains a free-school founded by inhabitants ; and also the usual kk 2"], [368, "268 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. establishments found in inland towns of similar size. It used to have a portion of the manufacture of the lighter woollen fabrics, such as were made at Romsey and the other towns on the Test and its branches ; but these have declined, and it cannot now be looked upon as a manu facturing town. Still it is an active place; and although there is no architectural beauty, and not much pictorial effect about it, it is an agreeable little town. With it we must close our brief notice of the valley of the Anton ; and proceed, as lying next in order, to THE VALLEY OF THE UPPER TEST. Though the stream that flows along this valley, rises farthest to the north, and most immediately in the great northern ridge, it is by no means the most interesting of the four which unite their waters to form the main trunk of the lower Test. This valley, taken along the general course of the hollow, from the junction of the Anton at Kilcombe to the water shed at the extremity of the northern ridge as belonging to Hampshire, and just to the north of a patch of Berks, which comes in here, may be estimated at about twenty miles, without including the smaller meanderings of the stream. The breadth nowhere exceeds four or five miles ; and the greatest portion of that is on the left or eastern bank. The lofty ridge stretches nearly parallel to the course of the river ; and a spur of it extends south, to within about two miles and a half of Whitchurch, which is on the eastern branch of the river, The highest summits in the county \u2014 those of Sidown hill, near Highclere, and the Beacon hill, near Burghclere, are situated where this stem branches to the southward. The junction of the Whitchurch branch of the river is about six miles and a half above that of the Anton, which leaves about thirteen for the valley of the upper Test pro perly so called ; but the river is not permanent at all sea sons, for more than nine or ten miles. After the Whit-"], [369, "269 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. church branch joins, the downs on the left bank of the river are less elevated than the chalk ridge of the north ; and they are in general naked of timber, ancl contain few or no villages or places of any interest, excepting such as are situated close to the stream or its meadows, and even then they are few and of small interest. The opposite bank is a little better ; and had sufficient attractions for inducing Elfrida, the mother of Ethelred, to select here a site for the nunnery to which she retired, when worn out with a life of intrigue and man\u0153uvring. For about half-a-mile above Kilcombe, the three branches of the Test are united into one stream ; and there is here a kind of gorge, formed by the approach of the high grounds to the channel; but immediately above, the flat part of the val- ley expands, the branches ramifying with each other, over meadows about a quarter of a mile in width, and for a length of about two miles, at the end of which the southerly branch, which flows parallel to the upper part of the Itchen, be- comes a separate stream. At this part, where the channels of the river divide the valley into insular meadows, the village and parish church of Chilbolton are situated on the left bank, and those of Wherwell, on the right, nearly op- posite. The immediate banks of the river are rich and pleasant on both sides ; but on the Chilbolton side, the surface soon rises into high and bleak downs, which con- tinue the greater part of the way to Winchester ; but still, a few farm-houses are spotted over them ; a part of the surface is under crop, and some of it is planted. Chilbolton is a parish, with a valued rental of c\u00a32309, and a population of 375, the greater part of whom are collected into the long and straggling village at the church \u2014 as there is no water upon the high lands in the summer months ; but the parish is extensive, in comparison both to the population and the rental. We may here hazard the conjecture that Chil, which forms part of the names of about thirty parishes in different parts of England, is in all probability, a different pronunciation of the Gaelic or Irish Kil, in which the K is"], [370, "270 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. asperated, or guttral, and therefore subject to considerable differences of sound, as is the case with all letters, whether single or double, which require that nice action of the or gans, which brings out those secondary sounds, as they may be called. If so, it would imply that there was some simi larity between the language of the Belg\u00e6, and the earlier Celts ; as the word Chil, or Kil, is applied to a place of sepulture, or of devotion, in both. It is the same as the Latin cella, and the English cell, which may be an altered pronunciation of either. Cella, from the word celo, to con ceal, \" or shut up,\" may mean any place for concealing, se curing, or preserving, anything on which value is set \u2014 the remains of an ancestor, the symbols or means, or place, of religious worship, or any thing else dear to man. Ccelum, the heavens, and the word \" ceal,\" have the same meaning. There is something \" concealed \" by them, and they, at the same time, give evidence of the fact of the concealment, by an indication of some kind or other. Wherwell, though in the close vicinity, is much more pleasantly situated than Chilbolton, as one might infer from its having been the locality of an abbey, and especially of an abbey founded by such a woman as the chroniclers re present Elfrida to have been. This queen \u2014 for although not born with that expectation, she contrived to become one \u2014 may be considered as \" the Lady Macbeth\" of England ; and the tolerably well authenticated history of her adven tures, is a parallel to the since invented character of the Scottish lady. It is well for the minions of King Edgar, that he had St. Dunstan for his counsellor ; for assuredly, if he had in any wise \" paltered with the fiend,\" his charac ter would have been darker than that of the Scot appears in the page of Shakespeare ; and it is equally well that he had monks for his historians. The late Dr. Milner, in his very profound history of Winchester, has these words, \" Ed gar was chiefly guided both in his public and private con duct, by the advice of St. Dunstan, archbishop of Canter bury, one of the greatest men of his age ;\" and yet, notwith-"], [371, ""], [372, ". . /. h.i.1,,1.,.1 ,\u201e,\u25a0//\u201e h,./,,,,,,., ., ...... i, ,11,-. j, Street ByDXaiZm.au, .1.1/,, \u25a0 library JJ\u201ejl S/rat"], [373, "271 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. standing this counsel, Edgar murdered Ethelred, the hus- band of Elfrida, in a wood near Wherwell, and then, with- out a word of rebuke from the saint, who had previously been so zealous in the case of Edwy, he took the instigatress of the deed to be his queen. But Edgar was bold and powerful, and he founded and endowed monasteries and nunneries, and moreover, he, \" like another David, or Theo- dosius,\" as Dr. Milner says, underwent the expiation of a seven years' penance. Elfrida too, after procuring the mur- der of the rightful heir to the crown, Edward the Martyr, son to Edgar by his former queen, \" made a movement \" in saint- ship and penance, \u2014 founded the nunnery at Wherwell, took the veil in it \u2014 when the cool of life had taken away the desire and the sweetness of iniquity, clothed herself in sack-cloth of hair, lived saintly, and was laid in the tomb, as a worthy member of the sorrowing sisterhood. And this was done in the golden age of the Romish church, in England ! Well, we who live under another system, may be thankful to Henry VIII for his deeds, if not for his intentions \u2014 with which we have very little concern. The pleasant and peaceful simplicity of the modern village of Wherwell, and its appropriate church, and its sabbaths, its prayers, and its homilies, comes out with refreshing and heavenly light, when projected on the dark back-ground of Elfrida and her abbey. Almost the only remains of the former state of Wherwell as a place of more note than it is now, are a charity school, and an annual fair. The parish is conside rable, containing 686 inhabitants, and having a rental of 3479/. Wherwell abbey had many patrons ; and among the rest, Pope Gregory IX. At the dissolution, its revenues amounted to between 300/. and 400/. It was thus nearly as well endowed as that at Romsey ; and both were for nuns of the Benedictine order : but whether they of Wher well were as much addicted to evening potations as their sisters at Romsey, has not been stated. Above Wherwell, and on the same bank of the river, Lonqparish is situated, the population of which, 775 in"], [374, "272 ' THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. number, are chiefly collected into straggling villages that extend about two miles along the bank of the river, and reach nearly to the juncture of the Whitchurch branch with the principal stream of the Test. This parish ancl its villages are not unpleasantly situated between the river and the woodland, but the opposite bank of the river is bleak, with very few inhabitants. At the junction of the branches of the river, there is a considerable extent of water-meadow, and meadows of the same kind, though of smaller extent, occur a good way up the river. On the right bank of the Test, a little above the junction of the two branches, the church and village of Hurstborne Priors is situated; and in the fork between the two streams, there are the mansion and grounds of Hurstbourne park, the seat of the Earl of Portsmouth. Hurst or hirst, is the term for a dry and naked height ; and as there is another Hurstborne farther up the valley, and a St. Mary Bourne intervening, it is probable that the Test has been once called \" the bourne,\" and the name Hirst has been prefixed to those places of it, where the cha racter of the adjoining banks rendered such an epithet ap propriate and descriptive. Hurstbourne Priors, is a parish of considerable extent, with a rental of 2495/. and a population of 490. It rises into high downs towards the western parts, but the mea dows on the river are of considerable extent, and the ad joining fields are rich. Hurstbourne park is extensive, and in a fine situation ; the mansion is on a commanding and healthy site, at the upper part of the park, from which there are slopes to the right and left to the river, and also in front toward the ornamental water in the park itself. There are some very fine trees in the park, especially oaks and beeches ; and it is well stocked with deer, The mansion is of adequate size, and appropriate to the situation ; so that altogether, this is an elegant and desirable residence.

' possession of the same family before the conquest, Soon after the conquest, they were created hereditary knights, or baronets ; and for many years bore an active part in the local and general service of the country. They were promoted to the peerage in the reign of Geo. I and Geo. II ; when, receiving extensive property from a maternal uncle, the third earl assumed the addition of Fellowes to the original name of Wallop. Above Hurstborne park, the slope upon that, the left, bank of the Test, increases in breadth from the river to the summit-level ; so that about the middle of its length, it measures from four to five miles across. It is well diversi fied by woods, cultivated fields, and downs ; and though there is no town in the valley, it contains a good many in habitants, and some of the villages are large and neat, though all is rural. As is usual in districts of similar character, the villages are chiefly upon the banks of the river ; but there are some in the northern part, towards the heights which form the natural boundary of the valley. St. Mary Bourne is the first parish ; and it is a rich and populous one, the rental being upwards of 6000/. and the number of inhabitants 1125. The church is about two miles and a half above Hurstbourne Priors; and the ad joining village extends along the stream for about a mile, chiefly on the eastern bank. The Sarum and Silchester Roman road crossed the Test at St. Mary Bourne, and though obliterated on the lower slopes, the direction of it can still be traced on the downs, both to the east and the west. About two miles east of the village, and a little to the north of the road, is the old fort or embattled camp of Egbury, which, from its square form, and its vicinity to the road, may be supposed to be Roman. It is not strictly a hill-fort, like those in the west of the county ; but it is upon a spot commanding a considerable length of the Roman road, and also of the valley of the Test. Hurstbourne Tarrant is three miles higher up ; and, intervening, there is the considerable village of Stoke, situ- VOL. I. LL"], [378, "274 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. ated where the valley expands into a water-meadow of some breadth, as is usual where \"stoke\" forms part of the name. - Hurstbourne Tarrant is a pretty large parish, though not so much so as St. Mary Bourne. The rental is valued at 3150/. and the population amounts to 786. The village, situated upon several diverging roads, is considerable ; but the inhabitants of the rest of the parish are few. The manor once belonged to the abbey of Tarrant in Devon ; but Edward VI granted it to Sir William Powlett and his heirs for ever, for the maintenance of the fortifications and an insignificant garrison at Netley Castle \u2014 the same little fortalice between the abbey and the Southampton Water, which is now in ruins. The road from Andover to Newbury passes through the village at Hurstborne, which has caused a number of the houses to be built across the direction of the river, and also gives more activity and bustle than is to be found in villages where there is no thoroughfare. This road passes through Dolle's wood to the west of the village, and through Faccombe wood to the east \u2014 the latter being the most con siderable extent of woodland in the valley. Between the wood and the height, there are the three parishes of Wood cot, Crux Easton, and Ashmansivorth, placed at no great dis tance from each other. Woodcot is a small parish, with a rental of 850/. and a population of 90 ; Crux Easton has 7 inhabitants more, but the rental is only 767/. Ash mansworth, the most northerly of the three, contains a vil lage, and has a population of 222, and a rental of 1205/. One mile north-east of Crux Easton, on the Newbury road, brings one to the summit-level, a little beyond the juncture of the roads, at \" three-legged cross \" ; and less than four miles more of a descent on the slope, brings one to the bank of the Embourne, and consequently to the boundary of the county in this direction. But this portion is of a different character, and belongs to another natural division, so that we must return and take a glance at the remainder of the valley. From Hurstborne"], [379, "275 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. Tarrant, a winding road proceeds in a northerly direction, through Faccombe wood, by Netherton, across the downs to Combe, and then across the principal ridge to Hunger ford ; and about a mile to the left of this road, near Nether ton, is the parish church of Linkenholt. This is an up land parish, containing only 87 inhabitants, with a rental of about 700/. Combe, which lies in the head of the val ley, is rather more extensive ancl populous, the rental being 1283/. and the population 193 ; but the whole country here is elevated, and in general bleak, though to the south of Combe, there is a considerable patch of wood land, named Combe wood. Combe, or Coombe \u2014 Kaim, or Kame, in Scotland \u2014 means \" a ridge ;\" and whenever it forms part of the name of a place, it implies that there is an elevated ridge in the vicinity. The northern part of the parish of Combe is only between four and five miles from Hunger ford on the Kennet and Kennet and Avon canal. To the westward of Combe, a triangular projection of Wilts comes across the summits of the ridge, and reaches more than a mile down the southern slope ; but this can scarcely be said to be in the valley of the Test, as there is no river or stream of any kind, at least in dry weather. The parish of Vernhams Dean lies to the south-west of Linkenholt, near to where a stream of water begins to appear as the Test, and this is the only other parish in the valley. Vernham's Dean is an extensive parish, containing 694 inhabitants, and having a rental of 2661/. VALLEY OF THE WHITCHURCH BRANCH. The branch of the river in this portion of the valley is only about nine miles in length, and there is a considerable space at the summit-level, where there is no water ; but the natural division of the county may be more advan tageously taken according to the trend of the hills, which is about two miles to the north-west of Basingstoke. That town, and a portion of the valley immediately to the west of it, belong to another natural division of the county, as the ll2"], [380, "276 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. slope is the other way, but as the valleys of the Test and Loddon run into each other at their upper extremities, without any distinct ridge separating them, an arbitrary point must be taken; and Worting, on the London road from Basingstoke to Whitchurch, is as convenient as any. The western point of the chalk ridge on the north, as bounding this valley, may be taken at the old fort of Winklebury, on the hill a mile and three quarters north west of Basingstoke ; and it so happens that this is also the termination of the bold part of the ridge itself eastward ; there being from this hill a gradual decent towards the plain. This hill is about nine miles due east of the south ern extremity of the spur which projects from the elevated summits of Sidown hill, and Beacon hill at Kingsclere. Between these two points, the ridge forms an irregular curve, concave to the south, or rather two curves, a smaller one, of about three miles in the chord, from Winklebury westward, and a larger one from thence to the western extremity in the rear of Hurstbourne park. The breadth of the segment contained between the line of the valley and the water-shed, along this curve, or these curves, is about three miles on the average ; and the slope is gradual. In the immediate vicinity of the ridge the soil is of course rather thin and the climate cold ; but, as one descends, the the surface is rich and beautiful, and finely diversified by wood. From the elevated points upon the other, or left, bank of the river, this slope has a very fine appearance ; and the valley, though of no great extent, is rich. Upon the left, or south side, the surface is less bold and much of it consists of dull flat heights of trifling elevation. The sameness of it is however relieved by occasional plan tations ; but, taken on the whole, it is one of the least inte resting parts of Hampshire ; as it is deficient in those remains of antiquity which give an historical interest to the bleak places on the borders of Wilts, and wants the elevation and diversity of those in the east of the county about Peters field. A line across the downs southward, from Overton,"], [381, "277 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. which is in the valley opposite the middle of the curve, to Weston, on the more southerly branch of the Test, is about six miles and a half in direct length; and another line parallel to this, and about two miles to the west of it, ex tending from Whitchurch to Upper Bullington, is about four miles. The surface of the portion of country which lies between these two branches of the river, and westward of the general water-shed of the county, may be estimated at about thirty square miles, and in all this there is not a perennial brook or stream of running water worthy of notice, a conspicuous mansion, or any object of much interest to the tourist. The greater part of it consists of chalky downs, diversified by swells, which are not entitled to the name of hills ; but there are some of the eastern eminences, upon which the chalk is covered with gravel, and the portions intermediate, between that and the chalk, have a mixture of clay and loam, and are more fertile than either of the pre dominant soils where they occur alone. The natural boundary of the district eastward, cannot be very accurately defined, as there is a very long extent of the high ground without any river, The average boundary which can be most easily remembered \u2014 and it is not very far from the true one, is a line drawn from Windmill hill on the London road, about six miles to the east of Alres ford, to Worting, where the London and Southampton rail way crosses the high-road from Basingstoke to Salisbury, about two miles west of the former of these places. But this line extends from the middle of the valley of the Itchen, to that of the Whitchurch branch of the Test, and has its terminations a little to the eastward of the first sources of both rivers, as they appear in the summer, which may be considered as the proper state in which to describe them as permanent rivers ; and Farleigh wood and common, about four miles to the south-east of Worting, may be considered as very nearly the place where the heads of the valleys of the Itchen, the Test, and the rivers which flow to the east ward, meet together."], [382, "278 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. The eastern part of this portion of the county contains several open downs and commons, but much of it is fertile and well wooded. There are many beautiful spots in it ; but there is nothing of a picturesque character. As one proceeds westward, it becomes more and more bleak, until the vicinity of the fork where the branches of the river join, and there are no trees except a few artificial ones of recent planting. There are some old forts, barrows, and other indications of former hostilities upon these downs ; but they are few in comparison with what are to be seen in other places of the county. The most remarkable one, upon the south, or left bank of the river is Tedbury hill, but it is, strictly speaking, in the valley of the branch of the river. On the right bank, those remains are more numerous. We have already alluded to the hill forts, on Beacon hill, Ladle hill, White hill, and Winklebury hill ; and, in addition to these, there are, upon both sides of the modern road from Whitchurch to Newbury, and about midway between Litchfield and Burghclere, a number of ancient tumuli, known by the name of \" the seven barrows,\" But neither forts nor bar rows have any story to tell, farther than that they are monu ments of defence and battle, They are evidently anterior to the time of the Romans ; and appear to have no con nexion with the Roman road from Old Sarum to Silchester, which passes for about seven miles through this part of the valley, but without any obvious reference to them ; unless we are to suppose that, while the Roman troops were in the habit of passing along this road, the Britons were in posses sion of the fort on Beacon hill, and had given battle to a Roman party on the downs where the barrows are situated ; and this is not very probable. The fort on Beacon hill, is one of the largest of the story less forts in this part of England. It is merely an entrench ment, of an irregular shape, with an entrance on the south, defended by two short trenches in advance ; and there is a sort of mound to the north. The ditches, as in other places, vary in depth, according to the necessity for them. There"], [383, "279 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. are several heaps, or mounds of ruin, within the walls ; and the surface under the turf is paved, perhaps artificially, with flints. There is, however, no vitrification of the flints, or any other evidence of the spot having been used for a fire-signal. Had it been so used, there would have been an accumulation of ashes, and the flints would have been fused into masses, as the stones are at the vitrified forts in the north, although flints are much more fusible by the ac tion of fire and the alkali of wTood-ashes, than many of the kinds of stone which are completely agglutinated in these. Beacon hill is, however, a very commanding station, and the view from it is very extensive, except for a small por tion toward the west, where it is interrupted by the greater altitude of Sidown hill, which overtops Beacon hill by 42 feet, \u2014 Beacon hill being 900 feet, and Sidown 942. In a land of mountains, these hills would be looked upon as pig mies ; but in a chalk and gravel country, where all the di versities of the surface have apparently been occasioned by the action of water without the assistance of any more power ful agent, they are giants. The \" seven barrows \" to the south of Beacon hill, from which they are about a mile and a quarter distant, are really ten in number ; but three of them are much smaller than the others ; the high barrows have a considerable quantity of mould on the top, which has apparently been dug out of the trench which surrounds the base. Immediately beneath this mould, there is an accumulation of flints, the lowest portion of which forms a sort of arch ; and under the arch there are ashes, and bones partially calcined. From these circumstances, it is obvious that cremation had been prac tised in Britain, at the time when these barrows were con structed ; and that the collection of materials had been made as a funeral rite ; and not for the purpose of protect ing the bodies of the dead from the predatory animals, as was the object of the stone cairns in the north. The char coal found in the barrows, which in all probability was that used in the burning of the bodies, appears to be of beech"], [384, "280 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. wood, which may be said to be the native timber upon the hanging sides of the chalky downs, although great part of the southern slope of this ridge is now destitute of timber of any kind. These barrows are of considerable size, the largest of the high ones being about a hundred yards in circuit at the base, and between three and four yards in height. In the low barrows, the inhumation of the remains had been made in pits sunk in the chalk, with little accumulation of materials to raise the barrows above the general surface. So far as can be gleaned from appear ances, and from the reports made of them when opened, each of these barrows seems to have been an entire struc ture, made at one time and for one purpose, and it is pro bable, that the construction of the whole was simultaneous, which is pretty conclusive evidence that every assemblage of barrows which we meet with, is the memorial of a battle ; and as all the barrows met with in this part of England, much resemble each other in structure, there is some reason to conclude that the whole of the inhumations after the battles, were performed by one and the same people ; but of the dates of their construction we have no knowledge whatever. About three miles to the south of \" the seven barrows,\" and less than two miles to the north of Whitchurch, there is an insulated one, locally termed \" Lark's barrow,\" but whether it belongs to the same date as the cluster, there are no means of ascertaining. The camp on Ladle hill, about a mile and a half east-and by-south of that on Beacon hill, is much smaller ; but still of considerable dimensions. Its form is nearly circular, and the average diameter about two hundred and twenty yards. It has a much smaller outwork on the north-eastern slope of the hill ; which seems to indicate that the forts were made as a sort of barrier between the people on the opposite sides of the ridge ; but the barrows here are differently situated, with regard to the forts, from what they are on the western downs, as here they are upon what may be called the Hampshire side; whereas, there they are on the other."], [385, "281 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. We may be sure that the battles were fought on the same side of the forts as the barrows appear ; but who were the vanquished or the victors, or whether the forts belonged to the northern or the southern people, we have no means of ascertaining. To the southward of the fortifications on Ladle hill, there are three barrows. The fort at Winklebury, behind Basingstoke, is also of considerable dimensions; and it is of different form and structure from the others ; but whether of the same date, more ancient, or more modern, there are no means of ascer taining. It is an oblong, with the angles rounded off ; and the perimeter of it is upwards of a thousand yards. The defence of this fort consists of an embankment only, \u2014 at least, if there was originally any ditch, every trace of it has been long obliterated. The whole southern slope of this ridge of hills is now very bleak for some distance below the summit, but it im proves as the line of the river is approached. The hollows are, however, comparatively rich, even near the summit ; and they might be rendered much more productive than they are at present. The only parishes here, near the ridge, and at a distance from the river, are Litchfield, Hannington, and Wootton St. Lawrence. Litchfield is an upland parish, with a rental of 850/., and a population of little more than 80. Han nington, though also in great part upland, contains a much larger village; and has a rental of 1466/., and a population of 287. Wootton St. Lawrence is more valuable and more populous, the rental being 3243/., and the population 847. On the downs to the southward, there are also not above three parishes, distant from the river, which can with pro priety be included in this natural district of the county ; and these are all in the eastern part, toward the summit level ; as, toward the west, the parishes, of which the churches and villages are seated on the rivers, meet each other on the heights. Steventon, North Waltham, and Drummer, are the three parishes alluded to, The first of them is VOL. I. MM"], [386, "282 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. about five miles east-and-by-south of Whitchurch ; and the others lie in a south-easterly direction, at distances of about a mile and a half apart. The closeness of these three parish churches to each other, is evidence that this part of the county is more fertile than the southern slope of the hills on the other side ; and the fact is established by the rental and population of these parishes, near as they are to each other, and though none of them is situated immediately on the bank of any stream. Steventon has a rental of 1636/., and a population of 197 ; North Waltham has 1772/. rent, and 458 inhabitants; and the numbers for Drummer are 2213/., and 383. There only remains to be noticed, the parishes, villages, and towns which are situated on this branch of the river itself This is, of course, the richest part of the whole dis trict, and it has an advantage over all the other valleys of the branches of the Test, from being the line of one of the great thoroughfares between the east and the west, and from there being no such height to pass over between the inclinations on the opposite sides of the summit, as there are in the other vallies of this county. In former times, there was a good deal of manufacturing carried on, upon the line of this branch of the river ; and there are still some paper and silk mills ; but we believe we are correct in say ing that the character and occupation of the majority of the people are becoming more and more agricultural every day. Tufton, or Tuckington, is the first parish above the junc tion of this branch. It is situated on the left bank of the river, opposite Hurstborne Priors ; and, though the surface is comparatively bare, and the population not great, the value is considerable. The rental is 1350/., and the num ber of inhabitants nearly 200. Whitchurch, the only market-town in the valley, is situated nearly a mile farther up the river than Tufton, and on the opposite bank. Whitchurch is a borough by pre scription, of which the Dean and Chapter of Winchester, as lords of the manor, annually elect or appoint the mayor."], [387, ""], [388, "lltri./i,-. t. r. Published tbr the Bvpneror JaPBoiiuu {oHeoe-Jaeel"], [389, "THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY 283 It was a parliamentary borough from the 24th, Elizabeth to the time of passing the Reform Bill, when it was disfran- chised. When the manufactures of light woollen fabrics existed in the county, Whitchurch had its share of them ; but they have partaken in the fate of the others. Besides being the market-town to the surrounding district, its chief importance now is derived from its being situated on two roads of considerable traffic, \u2014 the great road through Basing- stoke to Salisbury, and the road from Southampton and Winchester to Newbury, the valley of the Thames, and the centre of England. There are in all, five roads which branch off from the centre of Whitchurch, like the rays of a star, and nearly at equal angles ; though four of them are on the north bank of the river, and only one on the south, so that the angles between this and the proximate ones on the north are rather more obtuse than those between the northern ones. This southern one is the Winchester and Southampton road ; and, taking the others in order from left to right, they are, \u2014 the Salisbury road, the road to the eastern slope of the valley of the Test, the road over the downs to Newbury, and the London road, through Basing- stoke. The houses are built along the lines of these roads, extending about a half-a-mile along the London road, and a quarter of a mile along the others. The town, which does not appear to have at any time contained any local object of particular attraction, has thus, in all probability owed its establishment to its being a thoroughfare, and having direct communications with so much of the neighbouring district to the north, which is, generally speaking, more populous than that to the south. The manufactures were, in reality, excrescences on the natural state of the place ; and accord ingly their gradual failure has not been attended wnh any falling off in the number of the inhabitants, however it may have affected the wealth of individuals at the time ; for there has been an increase of about 24 per cent, in the population in the thirty years following 1801. This rate of increase in the population of Whitchurch, is not quite mm 2"], [390, "284 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. so great as that of Romsey, though it approaches to within two per cent, of that, and the difference, under the same decline of manufacture, is to be attributed to the greater fertility of the country about Romsey, and to its being on the Andover canal, as well as on numerous lines of well frequented road. But there is now more scope for agricul tural improvement in the district to which Whitchurch is central, than to the Romsey district, so that a gradual in crease of the town is not a problematical matter. For between three and four miles above Whitchurch, there is a succession of villages and parish churches in this valley ; and the population is of course considerable, as, though the parishes extend a long way over the downs, the habitations of the people are for the most part near the river. Frees oik is the first to which one comes ; and it lies about a mile and a half to the east of Whitchurch. It is only a hamlet or chapelry, with a population considerably below a hundred, and a rental of 1000/., which shows that the land is valuable. It is about this point that the banks of the valley begin to change from light chalky soil to clay and gravel ; and the change immediately tells in a greater luxuriance both of the ground herbage, and of the trees. This hamlet was long celebrated for the manufacture of bank-note paper. The church is on the left bank of the river ; but the village is on the right ; and the London road crosses from the left bank to the right, between the church and the village. Laverstoke, about a mile to the east of Freefolk, lies on the right, and at a little distance from the river. The population of this parish is 117, and the rental 1608/., which shows an increased ratio to the population. In this part of the county there are no first rate mansions, but there are some neat chateaus, pleasantly situated ; and the scenery is in many spots rich. Overton, about another mile to the east, is a rich and populous pa rish, containing a large village, and having a rental of 6719/., and a population of 1507. Silk-throwing has been carried on to some extent in this village. Overton is not a regular"], [391, "S,\u201e. /\u201e./., /;./,/,,/.,,/ fa, //, A,,,..,,/,,,../.' /.'./..

The London road is the only thoroughfare through this village,* and the chief part of the houses is built stragglingly along the sides of it ; but there are many cross-roads, and one con siderable section of the houses extends southward along one of these. The parishes of Ash and Dean, lie to the east of Overton, the first about a mile and a quarter from that, and the second not a quarter of a mile farther. They are both rich agricultural parishes, Ash, having a rental of 1877/., and a population of 146, and Dean, 1427/. rent, and 163 inhabitants. The richness of the soil may be inferred from the existence of two parish churches so near to each other, as we never meet with them so close in places where, at one time, the country could not maintain a corresponding population. The mansion of Ash, which has long since given place to modern houses of less pretence, and no his tory, is not unrenowned in story ; and the parks still occupy a considerable part of the surface, and add not a little to the beauty of the country. The two manors were purchased by the celebrated William of Wykeham, about the latter part of the fourteenth century ; and they were left by him to his sister Agnes, in the possession of whose descendants they continued for some time \u2014 the son taking the name of Wykeham. The next female heir married Lord Sey and Sele, by the last of whom the manors were alienated ; and though they have often changed proprietors since that time, they have never returned to the descendants of any relation of Wykeham. Church Oakley, about a mile and a quarter to the east of Dean, though it is doubtful upon which side of the summit level it lies, may be included in this district. It is not quite so high in rental, compared with the population, as either of the parishes last named. It has a population of 249, and a rental of 1411/. The park of Hall Place is situated near to the church, and there are woods and copses in various parts of the parish ; but a good deal of its sur-"], [394, "286 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. face consists of open clowns. No great thoroughfare passes through the village ; but the cross-road upon the sides of which it- is built has a good deal of traffic ; and the railway comes within a furlong of the south end of it. The rail way passes for about ten miles and a half over the downs from Weston on the southern branch, to Worting on the Basingstoke side of the very indefinite summit-level ; and for the last four miles, it is not above a mile, on the average, from the high road between Basingstoke and Whitchurch. Worting is an agricultural parish, with a population of 120, and a valued rental of 1261/. The parish church is on the side of the high-road, and the adjoining village is small. The parish may be regarded as rather on the eastern slope ; but noticing it here, leaves Basingstoke as the boundary7 of the eastern natural division. VALLEY OF THE SOUTHERLY BRANCH. This branch of the Test has no name of its own ; and of the many villages on the banks of it, there is none of so paramount importance, as to give name to the river for its whole length. Its remotest source, as a permanent brook, is a little to the south of Stratton park, and near the Lon don road through Basingstoke, about seven miles from Win chester. There its quantity of water is quite insignificant ; and it is not great at any part of the course, which is about eight miles from the source to the first inosculation with the other branches of the Test. Small as it is, however, it suffices for irrigating meadows, turning mills, and filling ornamental ponds. Toward the source of this branch, the land is of excellent quality for a considerable breadth, and the hollow near the banks is richly wooded ; but as one de scends the course of it, the bleak downs approach much closer on each side, and the soil in the valley is inferior. As is the case upon most of the other branches, the valley is much larger than the river itself, so that the slope may perhaps be traced in the general inclination of the country, to four miles north-east of the actual source. Directly east-"], [395, "287 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. ward, the natural boundary may be taken at the average mean distance between the first appearance of this branch of the Test as a summer brook, and the north branch of the Itchen, which flows southwards by the Candovers, and forms the ornamental water in the grounds at Grange \u2014 al ready mentioned, and the distance to the middle line here, may be averaged at about a mile and a half; but it is very indefinite, as the hollows which incline different ways, over lay each other. The lateral boundaries are also very inde terminate; but they may be rudely estimated as averaging about three miles from the bed of the stream on the north side, and two miles on the south. There is nothing of his torical interest in this valley ; and not much to attract the attention of the generality of modern tourists. There is no mansion of any consequence within the valley, strictly so called, though Stratton park is connected with it, both physically and from the upper and richer part belonging to the owner of that mansion. Of the villages, the most con spicuous, though not the most beautiful, is Sutton, which lies where the road from Winchester to Whitchurch, and that from Basingstoke to Stockbridge intersect each other ; for, as both of these roads are considerable thoroughfares, and as other towns are at some distance upon all the arms of the crossing roads, this village is convenient as a resting place. Still, Sutton is only a village in the parish of Won ston, and has no church of its own. Barton Stacey is the parish which occupies this valley immediately above the confluence of this branch wTith the rest of the river. The church and village are upon the left bank, about half a mile from the water ; and the village extends for about the same length along a country road, leading north and south. The parish is extensive ; and has a rental of 2227/. and a population of about 623. This is~a small rental in proportion to the population, as compared with the agricultural parishes in the upper part of the Whitchurch valley, and also with those in the upper part of this valley. Hence, as this parish is wholly agricultural,"], [396, "288 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. and there are comparatively few inhabitants out of the vil- lage, one might infer that the soil is of inferior quality. Such is the fact : very much of the surface consists of heath downs ; and this part of the valley is very bare of timber. It might, however, be greatly ameliorated by sheltering belts of timber, judiciously disposed ; but there is a great deficiency of water in the dry season ; and the frosts and rains act severely upon the ploughed lands in the winter. The next parish above Barton Stacey is Bullington, rather more than a mile farther east, and nearer to the river on the same side. This parish is not so populous as the former, as it contains only 189 inhabitants ; but the rental is 1532/., which is a higher ratio to the population. There are two vil- lages in this parish ; Bullington, and Upper Bullington on the river, where the high-road from Whitchurch to Winchester crosses, which is about a mile and a quarter north of Sutton, the course of this reach of the stream being almost due north. Like Barton Stacey, the greater part of Bullington is high and naked of timber; but it enjoys a greater length of the river. Wonston, containing the village of Sutton, and that of Wonston near the church, farther to the east, and both on the left bank of the stream, is the next parish. Its population is considerable, being about 740, but the rental is small in proportion, not much above 1000/. The po- pulation resides chiefly in the villages, and much of the higher part of the parish is inferior land, though about the village at the church, it is richer, and sheltered with tim- ber. Rather more than a mile to the east of Wonston, are the village and parish church of Stoke Charity, still on the same side of the river. The southern part of this parish also lies upon the downs, and is rather bare, but there is a greater proportion of woodland near the river. The popu lation is 135, and the valued rental about 1600/. The scenery, in some parts is rich and beautiful. Indeed there is a gradual improvement in this respect as one ascends the valley. On the opposite bank of the river, about midway between"], [397, ""], [398, "Winchester, Published, fortfu- Proprietor, Ja,* Bobbins, CsHfig By B.E.Gibnoiir, Public Library, Righ street."], [399, "289 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. Wonston and Stoke Charity, the church of Hunton is situ ated. This is merely a chapelry, with a population of 112, and a rental of about 700/. On the same, that is the right, bank of the river, and rather more than a mile to the east ward, is Weston, which has a chapel, but is extra-paro chial, with only 17 inhabitants, paying a rental of more than 300/. Above these, and occupying the upper part of the valley, properly so called, there is the parish of Mitcheldever, the most rich and fertile of the whole. The population is 936, and the valued rent 8334/. The population is large for an agricultural parish ; and the rental does not bear so high a proportion to it, as in many of the less fertile parishes, where the population is scanty ; but still, Mitchel dever is one of the most wealthy of the several parishes in this part of the county, and it is one in which the cultiva tion of the fields is very well understood. Some of the south-eastern parts of the parish are downs and wild woods ; but there is a very great breadth of land under the plough, and the soil is in general a strong clay loam. The village is long and straggling, but highly rural, and there are some \" bits\" of the scenery exquisitely beautiful, especially about the ornamental waters into which the little stream has been accumulated here by the proprietor. These artificial col lections of water are in admirable keeping with the general character of the place, both in their forrns, and in the trees in which they are embodied. They exhibit none of that finical art, by which many of the otherwise fine scenes in England are spoiled and degraded out of all character, and all keeping with the surrounding country, and made to look like shreds of tinted paper, or bits of looking-glass, scattered about by way of ornamenting a grass plot. Every tree and shrub is left to take that form which suits its nature, and the situation and circumstance in which it is placed ; and where a post or a piece of railing is necessary, it is put up just as nature made it. This is the true mode of obtaining really ornamental wood and water scenery ; and an artist of genuine taste will find more to admire and to copy in VOL. I. nn"], [400, "290 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. the perfect nature of Mitcheldever, than in all the elaborately artificial shrubberies and pleasure grounds in the world. It is an advantage that there is no mansion here, for a man sion is one of those subjects which are always under the capricious domination of fashion ; and though it may not be a palatable truth either to those who lead the fashion, or those who live by it, yet it is a truth that all fashions are in themselves ugly, \u2014 else, why is an old fashion always un becoming and offensive, and the more so the the higher that it was in the mode when in vogue. Every one who reflects but for a moment must admit that such is the fact ; and thus we have only to go forward a few years in order to look upon the favourite fashion of the day as out of all con sistency and keeping, and a downright fright. In perish able matters, this constant succession of fashions altogether artificial, and therefore destitute of true beauty, may be unavoidable, may even be useful to a part of the community ; but in a matter of such permanence as an ornamental wood, it is injurious of all decent effect, and deserves the reproba tion of every one who dislikes to see the face of the coun try distorted and mangled. With the ornamental woods and waters at Mitcheldever, there is no fault of this kind to be found ; and the whole place from the glassy pool with its exuberance of clustering trees and expanded foliage, to the height of the downs, where there is not a drop but the dew of heaven, and no shelter for even the little harvest-mouse, all is in the most admirable keeping ; and the country passes from the one to the other by gradual and almost imperceptible shades, so as to form what may, not inaptly, be termed an intellec tual line of beauty. The houses of the village are spotted about with very pleasing irregularity, just as if each in habitant had chosen the spot which liked him best, and erected his cottage with a perfect feeling of the situation. The only fault of the place, in a rustic point of view, is the huddling of the parish church too much up in a grove of trees. This is always offensive, both to good taste and to"], [401, ""], [402, "TEE SEAT OF SIR TffOs BAKING WtnrhteC.r Published tor the -propruipr da' Robttns LcUe\u201e By D , . lie Library 0iSh St>vet."], [403, "291 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. genuine devotional feeling. When only a bit of the tower or spire of a church is seen over the trees, one is put in mind of the dark deeds which were perpetrated in, or have been fabled of, the groves of the Druids. Trees about a churchyard are in keeping ; and the more aged they are the better \u2014 though it is a mockery of the dead to cultivate flowers, especially annual flowers, upon the grave ; and the immortal yew, budding again upon the small remain of the once majestic trunk, is most touchingly characteristic ; but the temple of the God of Heaven should always stand im mediately in the free air of heaven ; and gratitude for His goodness should be breathed in the pure element of life, as well as in purity of heart and sincerity of the lips. Sir Thomas Baring, the present proprietor of much of the land in this neighbourhood, pays in general as much atten tion to the rural beauty of his fields, and the habitations of his cottagers, as he does to the purity of their morals, and the regularity of their conduct. In both of these respects, and in most others, Sir Thomas is a model which many country gentlemen would do well to imitate. But he, or some one before him, has had a great propensity to muffle up churches in clumps of trees \u2014 as if sewing fig-leaves to gether to hide the nakedness of that which ought to stand open and inviting to the sight of all men. The church of Stratton is a more perfect instance of this muffling up than that of Mitcheldever. True, it is within the grounds of Stratton park, and the grove in which the church is concealed is in so far appropriate that it is a grove of yew trees ; but still, in good taste, there ought to be some air and space about it. There are some handsome cottages, which are ornamental to the entrance ; and surely the church should not be less so. With this exception, the village of Stratton, is in a different style from Mitcheldever, and it wants the water which is so ornamental there ; but still it is a fine village, consisting of neat, clean, and appro priate cottages, not huddled together in a lump, but stand ing apart so that the inmates have freedom to breathe. In NN 2"], [404, "292 THE TEST AND ITS VALLEY. the park there is not much to find fault with \u2014 or to praise. There are fine trees, but the taste of some \" capabilitist,\" has drawn them up in lines and columns which are rather stiff and formal ; and there is a want of small sized ones to melt the boundary lines into the lawn. The house too, has a stiffness and formality about it ; and agrees better with the artificial part of the landscape than with the natural. But the faults of the house and grounds are very old faults, and could not now be rectified but at an immense and unjustifia ble sacrifice. Still one regrets them ; for there are situations within the grounds, upon which, if Stratton house had been placed, a very large extent of the country might have been taken into its landscape. The parishes of Woodmancott and Popham : the first two miles north-east of Stratton, and the second one mile north of the first, may be regarded as occupying the extreme up per part of this valley ; and they form a remarkable con trast with the parish just noticed. Woodmancott is situated on the heights in rather a bleak part of the country, but there is still a wood of some extent a little to the north of the village. The rental of the parish is 669/. and there are 92 inhabitants, the principal part of whom reside in a small village by the church. Popham was a place of some note in the olden time, as the lords of its manor were men of knightly worship, and sometimes sheriffs of the county. The wToods, of which the remains lie around, are parts of the ancient demesne. The parish at present has a rental of 1204/. and a population of rather more than a hundred. The fields are bare in their aspect, but they are not unpro ductive.
