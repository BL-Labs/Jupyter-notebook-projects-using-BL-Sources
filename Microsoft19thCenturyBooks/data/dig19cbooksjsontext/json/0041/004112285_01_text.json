Part II. ofthe Norway Pilot contains directions for the west and north coasts of Norway ; extending from the Naze to North Cape, and thence to Jacob river, the boundary between Norwegian and Russian Lapland. The directions from the Naze to Bergen are founded on Vols. III. and IV. of \" Den Norske Lods/' compiled by C. F. Wille, Lieu tenant Royal Norwegian Navy, from Government Surveys made in the years 1855-68, published in 1869. The description of the coast and channels between Bergen and Trondhjem is chiefly based on the latest Norwegian charts. These portions of the work also contain extracts from a translation of the original directions by the Danish Admiral P. de Lowenorn, which was partially pre pared for the press by Mr. H. A. Moriarty, Master R.N., in 1856, but not then published. The directions from Trondhjem to Jacob river are derived from Vol. VIII. of \" Den Norske Lods,\" which was prepared under the direction of Captain Vibe, Royal Norwegian Engineers, 1828-48, and published with corrections in 1870. This Volume has been compiled from the above sources by Lieu tenant George T. Temple, R.N., who translated the latest editions of the works mentioned, and furnished much additional informa tion, derived from authentic sources, and verified in many places by personal observation and experience. The whole work has now been compared with the most recent charts of tbis long line of coast, by Staff-Commander W. R. Martin, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, and prepared for the press by that officer. Embracing as the work does a large extent of coast and numerous out-lying islands and rocks, \u2014 rendering navigation intricate, \u2014 occasions for the amendment and revision of its numerous details will doubtless occur in the interests of seamen.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND DIRECTIONS : THE NAZE ; HARBOURS BETWEEN THE NAZE AND MANDAL. Norway, a conjoint kingdom and sovereignty with Sweden, occupying the western and northern portion of the Scandinavian peninsula, lies be tween the parallels of 58\u00b0 and 71\u00b0 10' north latitude, and the meridians of 4\u00b0 20' and 30\u00b0 east longitude. It is upwards of 1,100 miles in length from the Naze to the North Cape, varying in breadth from 40 to 250 miles, and comprises an area of 122,398 square miles, with a population of 1,830,000. The kingdom is divided into six stiffs or bishoprics, and 18 amts or pro vinces ; the cities of Kristiania and Bergen constituting each a separate jurisdiction. The fundamental law of the State, framed May 17th 1814, and modified on the 4th of November following, proclaims Norway to be a free, indivisible, and inalienable kingdom, united to Sweden under one sovereign. The Established Church is Evangelical Lutheran ; the form of Government a limited hereditary monarchy. CONFIGURATION.* \u2014 The northern and western portions of the Scandinavian peninsula consist of extensive table-lands, which dip some- what abruptly into the sea, and are separated by profound rents or natural fissures, through which the ocean penetrates far into the country, in some parts to the very spurs of the mountains ; these inlets are known as fiords or fjords,^ and a glance at the chart will show their directions and countless ramifications far better than any verbal description. In this part of the country certain tracts in the vicinity of Trondhjem, and the coasts of J\u00e6deren and Lister, are the only localities that can be designated plains. The great fiords of the north and west, and the short, narrow valleys, shut in by steep walls of rock, are succeeded in the south-eastern parts of Norway by valleys wider and longer, and with less precipitous sides ; while * See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Arctic Ocean and Greenland Sea, No. 2,282. t Spelt phonetically, \"fiord,\" throughout this work. K 740. Wt. B 1313. A"], [20, "2 [CHAP. I. INTRODUCTION. the rivers and streams frequently expand into lakes. The eastern and southern divisions ofthe peninsula form an inclined plain, comprehending Sweden and part of Norway ; this plain is intersected by numerous valleys, which may be regarded as so many furrows in its otherwise flat surface ; and though the rivers are small, one -twelfth of the whole area is occupied by lakes. Norway, though justly accounted a mountainous country, is so rather in respect of. its general elevation (which probably falls somewhat short of 4,000 feet), than from the conspicuousness of its isolated summits. Sweden is, by comparison, low and tame ; Norway defends it, like a huge break water, from the invasion of the North Sea, which, though still tremendous in force, would appear, from the traces of former convulsions, to have been in former times the seat of powers still more energetic. The ragged outline of the coast, the depth and extent of its inlets or fiords, the boldness of its headlands, and the multitude of its islands, often almost indistinguishable from the mainland, are facts now familiarly known. They seem to show that the boundary of sea and land has been decided only after a prolonged struggle ; that great masses of rock have gradually been undermined or abraded, and that a tolerably permanent condition has only been obtained, when, after the crumbling of lesser obstacles, the mountains themselves have become the buttresses of Scandinavia. OROGRAPHY. \u2014 The general surface of Norway, especially in the southern division of the country, is composed of broad, elevated, and barren table-lands known as fields, or more properly fjelds* which preserve a rough parallelism to the coast, and were for a long time erroneously sup posed to form a continuous serpentine water-shed or ridge. Geographers have divided these mountain masses into three principal sections, the Kjolen, Dovre, and Lang fjelds ; and these again are subdivided into numerous minor groups connected by lower elevations. The Kjolen range comprehends the whole northern division about as far south as Roraas, in lat. 62^\u00b0 N, where a pass only 2,000 feet above the level of the sea inter sects the mountains in a transverse direction. This range has not in the far north the peculiarly tabular form of the southern mountains, and is dis tinguished by many summits of noble forms, attaining its greatest elevation, 6,200 feet, at Sulitelma, in lat. 67\u00a3\u00b0 N. Stretching from Roraas in a westerly direction as far as the valley of the Rauma-elv (where there is also a deep incision in the mountains), is the Dovre-fjeld, the greater part of which forms a vast plateau, maintaining a nearly uniform level of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet in height. Sneh\u00e6tten, the loftiest summit of the * Spelt 'fjeld ' throughout this work, as less likely to lead to the mistake of pronouncing it like the English 'field'; thej'e being pronounced like ye in yellow."], [21, "CHAP. I.] GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 3 Dovre-fjeld, attains an elevation of 7,620 feet above the sea level. South ward of the Rauma-elv are the masses of the Lang-fjeld section, and between Valders, Sogne, and Gudbrandsdal are the Jotunfjeldene, or Jotunheimen, which rise from a plateau whose mean altitude may be estimated at 4,000 feet, while the celebrated Galdhopiggen, the loftiest peak in Scandinavia, attains an elevation of 8,450 feet above the sea level, in lat. 61i\u00b0 N. Of the outlying mountains which approach nearest the sea the most remarkable are those of Fondalen, in lat. 66-67\u00b0 N. ; Justedal, in Sogne ; and Folgefond, in Hardanger. WratercOUrseS. \u2014 Of the numerous Norwegian rivers, only the Glommen and Drammens-elv, on the south coast, are navigable. Next to these the Tana, which for some distance forms the boundary between Norway and Lapland, is the largest river in the country ; but though broad and imposing in appearance, the lower part of its channel is not deep.* Banks of alluvial deposit, on which yachts and small vessels will find good anchorage, frequently extend a considerable distance from the mouths of the larger rivers. Lakes. \u2014 Norway abounds in fresh-water lakes, but none of them are of great extent. They are generally long and narrow, being for the most part formed by the expansion of river beds, and are frequently of great depth ; few, however, have been accurately sounded. The bottom of the larger inland lakes is often many hundred feet below that of the neigh bouring fiords, as, for instance, the Mjosen near Kristiania, and the Horningdalsvan near Nordfiord.f The Lesje V\u00e6rks Vand, southward of Sneh\u00e6tten, is 7 miles long and 2,050 feet above the level of the sea, and is the source of two rivers, the Rauma, which flows to the north-westward and the Gudbrands Laagen, which flows to the southward and eastward. This fact is worthy of note, for not only is it unusual for two large rivers to flow in contrary directions from the same source, but as the Losna, which is the continuation of the Gudbrands Laagen, falls into the Mjosen, from the south end of which the Vormen flows into the Glommen, the whole southern part of the country between Fredrikstad and Veblungsn\u00e6s is rendered insular. The SNOW-FIELDS and GLACIERS of Norway are fully described in Professor James D. Forbes's valuable work, entitled \" Norway * Oberst-lieutenant L. Broch. f The hypothetical explanation of this is that while during the ' glacial epoch ' the sea outside was shallowed by the deposit from out-flowing glaciers, the valleys under lying the thickest glacier-ice were eroded by it ; or, in other words, that the lake basins were scooped out by the grinding power of great glaciers sweeping over them. See \" Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain,\" by Professor A. C. Ramsay and \" The Great Ice Age,\" by A. Geikie ; also note to page 21. A 2"], [22, "4 INTRODUCTION. [CHAP. I. and its Glaciers.\" With regard to the snow-line, he observes that in lat. 60\u00b0 to 62\u00b0 N. the snow-line at a short distance from the coast may be considered to be at an elevation of 4,300 feet or thereabouts. In the same latitude, towards the centre of the country, it rises to 5,300 feet. In lat. 67\u00b0 N., in the interior, it has fallen to 3,500 feet, and is not much lower on insulated summits in lat 70\u00b0 N., though ou the coast it falls to 2,900 feet. This trifling effect of latitude is partly explained by the marked tendency of the summer isothermal lines to run parallel to the length of the peninsula of Scandinavia. Table showing Height of the Snow Line and Limit of the Common Birch (Betula Alba) in Norway. These numbers must be considered as approximations. It should be observed that though the surface actually perpetually covered by snow in Norway is small, yet the mountainous districts and table-lands every where approach it so nearly, that the snow plane may be said to hover over the peninsula, and any cause which should lower it even a little would cover a great part of the country under a mantle of perpetual frosts GEOLOGY. \u2014 The whole Scandinavian peninsula is highly inter esting to the geologist and mineralogist. Norway and Lapland are chiefly * By \" Coast\" is meant the comparatively narrow space between the shore and where the mountains first have a decided western declivity. t The position of the snow-line depends mainly on the summer temperature. It is exceedingly probable that a diminution of the temperature of the summer months by 4\u00b0 F. only would at once place one-fourth of the surface of Norway within the snow-line \u2022 and so vast a mass of perpetual snow would refrigerate the climate to such a degree as would unquestionably pour glaciers into the head of every fiord in western Norway. A diminution of the extremes of temperature would in the first place be most likely accompanied by an increased fall of rain and snow, while the lowering of the snow-line would deteriorate the climate and lower the mean temperature, which again would lower the snow-line still further.

I.] GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 5 composed of primitive and transition rocks. Granite is rare, the prevailing rock being gneiss, which sometimes alternates with granite. Mica-slate also abounds, and is associated with the gneiss ; in beds subordinate to both are limestone, quartz, and hornblende. The plateaux of the moun tains are often covered with blocks of a conglomerate rock, in which pebbles of quartz, feldspar, &c. are imbedded, and which, being smooth and rounded, have evidently been, during a remote but lengthened period, subject to violent friction. The southern part of Norway has frequently experienced earthquakes, and evidence exists in various parts of the country that it has been upheaved by volcanic action.* At the present time, while the northern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula are rising out of the sea at the average rate of about 4 feet in a century, the southern parts are subsiding. This fact is perfectly well established by reference to ancient high and low water marks, and by grooves specially cut in the rocks on the sea coast. The elder fishermen also state that they cannot now sail through channels easily passed in their younger days ; and many sunken rocks have become visible during the last 50 years, f MINERALOGY. \u2014 The Norwegian mountains appear to be rich in minerals, the chief products being iron, copper, silver, nickel, and cobalt. FLORA and FAUNA. \u2014 The flora and fauna of Norway display a greater richness and variety than those of any other quarter of the globe within the same parallels of latitude. Owing to the continuous daylight in summer, vegetable growth goes on with incredible rapidity. Barley ripens in- lat. 70\u00b0 N. ; and at Hammerfest (lat. 70-7\u00b0 N.), hay is made one month after the snow leaves the ground. The vast forests of pine and fir are still the haunt of bears, wolves, and lynxes, though they are gradually becoming extinct. The marine fauna of Norway, more especially those forms of animal life which occur at great depths, is also characterised by rich variety. J The great sea-fowl colonies and preserves \u00a7 of northern Norway will be mentioned hereafter. Caution. \u2014 The eider duck (eder-fugl, Somateria mollissima) is strictly preserved all the year round for the sake of the down, and there * The geological investigation of Scandinavia is being proceeded with on both sides ofthe peninsula: maps in illustration may be obtained at Kristiania.

INTRODUCTION. is a fine for shooting -them. The down taken from the dead birds loses its elasticity, and is but little esteemed.* POPULATION.\u2014 The inhabitants of different parts of Norway differ widely in habits, customs, and general mode of living; in fact large numbers of the inhabitants are entirely ignorant of the character and habits of their compatriots, being frequently cut off from intercourse by trackless fjelds. Of those inhabiting the coast region, it may be said that one and all look to the sea as the main source of their subsistence, while the bulk of the inland population is engaged in agricultural pursuits. The Norwegians are a tall, hardy, long-lived race. Patriotism, hospitality, and independence are their leading characteristics. The educational system is excellent, and the state of science, literature, and art, is highly creditable to the nation. Social differences are far less marked than in England, and there are consequently fewer class prejudices. The Norwegians are essentially a maritime people, and it may be safely said that in no country will British seamen be treated with more kind ness, courtesy, and honesty, than in Norway. All classes are cere monious in matters of politeness ; for instance, they are most scrupulous about taking off the hat, which is done in saluting, and always when entering a house or shop. A due regard to this, and many other similar observances, which, trifling as they may appear, show the natural good feeling which is characteristic ofthe nation, will do much to cement kindly relations. Norwegian workmen are generally somewhat slow, but all attempts to hurry on work by domineering or blustering are ineffectual, and much to be deprecated. The word \" strax\" (immediately), too readily learned by Englishmen, is very offensive to Norwegians when used in a tone of command without the softening qualification of \" v\u0153r saa god \" (be so good). This \" veer saa god\" is the first phrase to be learnt, and should be used continually. It is a common complimentary expression, and, used as a prefix to every request, acts like a talisman in securing prompt and cheerful attention. There are numerous public holidays, and on these little or no work is to be expected. The Lapps and Finns are nearly allied to each other, their language und physical constitution proving their Mongolian descent. In habits and mental characteristics, however, they display considerable diversity. Cutaneous diseases and chest affections are the most prevalent maladies in Norway. * The down when taken from the nests is very elastic, and is compressed into small balls, about the size of a man's fist, for the market ; each of these balls weighs 3 or 4 Ibs., and is sufficient to fill a quilt 5 feet square. The eider duck builds on small islands near the shore, and eacji female is said to yield half a pound of down, worth about 9 shillings ; this is probably an excessive estimate."], [25, "CHAP. I.] POPULATION. 7 STATISTICS.\u2014 The total population of Norway is 1,830,000 ; of these from 8,000 to 10,000 are Finns, or, as they are frequently termed, Qu\u00e6ns ; 17,000 are Lapps ; and in 1865 there were 3,900 half-breeds in the country. Of the Lapps, about 15,600 are Sea or Fisher-Lapps, and live on the coast; the remainder, about 1,600, are Fjeld-Lapps or nomads, who live partly by the chase and fresh-water fishing, but chiefly by the produce of their reindeer, the herds comprising, in 1865, about 102,000 tame animals. The distribution of inhabitants in Norway is very unequal, the lowland districts of the south and the region bordering on the Trondhjem fiord being most thickly populated, while upwards of one million belong to the coast region and islands. Almost all the towns in Norway are on or near the coast ; the town population in 1873 was 315,000. The cultivated area of Norway does not exceed 1,000 square miles, and the pasture land may be estimated at 3,400 square miles ; forests cover about one-fourth of the country ; the rest consists of barren, uninhabitable mountain land. Agriculture and farming, though pursued with some vigour of late, are still at a low ebb. The fisheries give employment to a large part of the population through out the year. The most important are the cod, herring, and mackerel fisheries, the Lofoten cod fishery giving employment to upwards of 20,000 men. Mining, as compared with other sources of national wealth, is one of the least productive. Ship-building and timber-dressing are the branches of industry most extensively prosecuted.* Commerce. \u2014 The foreign trade of Norway is very extensive, and has of late years been steadily and rapidly increasing. The imports consist chiefly of the necessary articles of home consumption. In 1878, the value of the imports from the United Kingdom was 2,294,775/. The principal articles of export are timber, salmon, cod and its oil, herrings, lobsters, minerals, furs, ice, &c. The value of the exports to the United Kingdom, in 1877, was 2,594,663/. Shipping. \u2014 The Norwegian mercantile marine shows great activity. In 1876 it consisted of 7,809 vessels, registering 1,436,000 tons, of which steam vessels represented 45,900 tons; thus, though the population of Norway is so small, her mercantile fleet is only exceeded in actual tonnage by those of England and America. In 1872, 13,000 vessels, registering 1,600,000 tons, entered inwards, and about the same number cleared outwards. In 1876, vessels entering inwards with cargo registered 851,000 tons, and those clearing outwards with cargo 1,544,000 tons. Thirty-five per cent. ofthe vessels entering inwards, and 17 per cent, of those clearing outwards, were steam vessels. The foreign tonnage amounted to 35 per cent. * For statistical details, see \"Norway Illustrated,\" by Chr. Tonsberg."], [26, "8 [chap I. INTRODUCTION. CLIMATE.* \u2014 The climate of Norway is healthy, and milder than that of any other region so remote from the equator ; it varies strikingly, how ever, in different tracts of the country ; the coast possessing the insular or moderate climate, the interior, or Swedish side, a much severer one. The table-land of Norway forms in all its extent a most important barrier, which generally separates the most opposite states of weather ; for instance, when it rains or snows on the east side of the fjelds, it is most probably fine on the west side. An intermediate climate occurs on the western depression of the peninsula, but at some distance from the outer coast line, towards the interior, it is like that of the inner parts ofthe fiords and the valleys connected with them, and is far superior to the climate of the islands and outlying portions of the coast, the mean temperature being higher, and vegetation more luxuriant. The excessive amount of rain, fog, and cloud, which lowers the summer temperature in the immediate vicinity of the ocean, is the principal cause of this difference. Thus, although Norway embraces upwards of 13 degrees of latitude, and 26 degrees of longitude, the existing climatic variations are due to local influences rather than geographical position. The mild climate which Norway enjoys must be ascribed to the high temperature of the ocean, and to the fact that the ground does not sink precipitously from the coast seawards, but forms a vast chain of banks, whose extent in a westerly direction is as yet unknown. Over these exten sive banks flows from south to north the warm surface current of the Atlantic, which, from its easterly direction, is steadily impelled towards the shore. This warm current preserves its heat-giving power beyond the North Cape and the entrance to Varanger-fiord, so that drift-ice is unknown on the western and northern coasts of Norway, and navigation is open all the year round. In winter, when the atmosphere is colder than the surface of the sea, heat is continually thrown off by the water ; but so great is the supply that the most rigorous season is unable to exhaust it. The underlying banks protect the water against cooling from beneath, and at the same time form an impassable barrier to the icy waters of the Polar Sea. But for these banks the climate of Norway would possibly be as severe as that of Greenland, and it is much to be regretted that our knowledge of their depth, position, and extent should be meagre in the extreme. The warm ocean current that washes the shores of Norway, by raising the temperature of the air during a great part of the year, and engendering a copious supply of vapour, materially reduces atmospheric pressure, drawing to northern latitudes the soft winds of the south. These genial breezes carry the aqueous vapour over the whole expanse of country, * The remarks on the climatology of Norway are based on the results of official observations taken at numerous stations in different parts of the country, and discussed at the Meteorological Institute of Kristiania."], [27, "CHAP. I.] 9 CLIMATE. where, at a considerable altitude, it condenses into clouds (thus providing against loss of heat by radiation during the long night of winter) and by falling at last as rain, imparts the pent up heat of evaporation, yielded originally by the waters of the ocean, to the surrounding atmosphere. Hence this warm current, in conjunction with the long sun-lit days of a northern summer, is the main condition on which agriculture in Norway depends ; as it is also, by supporting marine animal life, the origin of those great periodical fisheries which con tribute so largely to the prosperity of the nation.* Table showing dates between which the sun was constantly above the horizon in northern Norway in 1879.f Table showing dates of first and last appearance of the sun's centre above the horizon in northern Norway in 1879.| TEMPERATURE. \u2014 The coldest tracts in Norway, where the mean annual temperature is below freezing-point, are the loftiest of the fjelds, and the interior of Finmarken.

INTRODUCTION. the region bordering on Varanger-fiord is the sole locality whose mean annual temperature is below freezing-point, Nyborg, at the inner extreme of the fiord having a mean temperature of 29'3\u00b0F. The highest mean annual temperature, nearly 45\u00b0 F, prevails along the outer most coast line from Lister to Sogne fiord. The interior of southern Norway, and part of Finmarken, have the most protracted and coldest winter, the temperature being below freezing-point upwards of 200 days in the year, and the mean temperature .of the coldest day and night being less than 11\u00b0 F. In winter, the climate is milder on the coast than in the interior. From the Naze to Villa, on the Folden-fiord, there is a narrow strip of coast where the mean temperature of the coldest day and night is above freezing-point. The summer is warmest, (above 61\u00b0 F. in July,) in the eastern part of the country, in Hardanger, and in Indre- Sogn. The temperature at this season is lower on the coast than in the interior ; it is lowest on the Finmarken coast and the highest mountains, being about 44\u00b0 F. at the King's Mine, Roraas. The interior of Finmarken enjoys a warmer summer (in July from 53-5\u00b0 F. to 55-5\u00b0 F.) than any portion of the outer coast region north of Stadt. The interior of the country having a hot summer and a cold winter, and the coast region a cool summer and a mild winter, the annual variation of the mean daily temperature is most considerable in the inland districts, embracing in Finmarken more than 54\u00b0 F., and upwards of 45\u00b0 F. in the south of Norway ; it is less marked on the coast line, not exceeding 20\u00b0 F. on the Eomsdal coast, and averaging about 27\u00b0 F. from the Naze round the North Cape to Vardo. In the province of Osterdal, and the inner localities of Finmarken, the temperature occasionally falls to the freezing point of mercury (\u201440\u00b0 F.) ; on the outer coast region from J\u00e6deren to Romsdal it is never below 14\u00b0 F. A temperature of 86\u00b0 F. is sometimes experienced in east Norway and in Finmarken ; but on the west coast the thermometer seldom rises above 77\u00b0 F. The temperature rises in spring from the coast inwards, from north to south in Finmarken, and falls in autumn from the interior towards the coast in Finmarken, from south to north. In winter, the average temperature of the west coast of Norway is over 36\u00b0 F. higher than the corresponding average temperature in the same latitudes. So vast a surplus of heat is to be found in no other quarter of the globe. The average summer temperature of Norway is also higher, with the exception of a narrow strip of the south-west coast, than that of any other region in corresponding latitudes.* * Professor H. Mohn,"], [29, "CHAP- !\u2022] TEMPERATURE. 11 The following table is from observations registered at the Meteorological Institute, Kristiania, up to the beginning of 1872. TEMPERATURE. Of the above temperatures all the lowest were observed between the 7th and 27th of February, with the exception of that at Villa, -which was registered on the 6th of March ; the highest were all taken between the 19th of July and the 14th of August. The TEMPERATURE of the SEA on the Norwegian coast is almost invariably above freezing-point at the surface. This is also the case in most of the fiords. The deep water shows degrees of heat all the year round. In summer the water is warmer at the surface than at some depth below it ; in winter the reverse is commonly the case. The annual fluctuations of temperature are greatest at the surface ; they are but trifling in deep water. During the greater part of the year the surface of the sea has a higher temperature than the atmosphere ; in one or two of the summer months only is it colder. Hence the waters of the ocean may be regarded as a vast reservoir of heat, whence the atmosphere supplies its losses nearly the whole year through.* * Professor H.

In summer the most prevalent winds are those from the sea, which follow the direction of the coast from north to south. In winter land-winds prevail ; these also follow the direction of the coast, but from south to north, and frequently blow directly out of the fiords. The wind seldom blows dead on or off-shore, but generally follows the line of the coast. Within the islands the wind nearly always follows the direction of the fiords, blowing straight up or down them. South-westerly winds are on the whole the most prevalent ; they veer commonly through south to south-east towards the north of Norway. Easterly winds generally bring fine weather on the coast, and rain in the interior to the eastward of the mountains. Westerly winds bring rain or snow along the coast, and dry weather inland. In the south of Norway light southerly and south-easterly winds sometimes bring rain or snow. In summer, light cool winds are frequently accompanied by fog and misty rain. Calms are frequent on the coast in summer, but rare in the interior ; in winter the reverse is commonly the case. The finest weather may be expected in June, July, and part of August. Gales may be expected in the proportion of 30 days in the year on the coast, but only four days in the interior. There are more frequent gales in the winter solstice than during the equinoxes, and in summer they are un common ; the heaviest gales occur in December and January. Gales from south-west are the most common ; next in frequency to these are west and north-westerly gales. The wind is much more violent on the coast than in the interior. South-westerly gales are frequently accompanied by rain ; they some cimes blow in violent gusts, aud shift suddenly to north-west, and even to the eastward of north, increasing almost to a hurricane, and causing a very heavy cross sea ; these are considered the most dangerous of all on the west and north coasts. If the wind continues fixed in the north, and its force moderates, the weather becomes fine ; but should it back round to the south west, bad weather is sure to return. It has been observed that those gales which occur during spring tides are more violent, and last longer, than those which blow during the neaps, and that they acquire their Stations. re _ re _*\u2022_ c3 \u25a0Srs 8 _ __ ao = o -M h pq 73 \"e _-_. \u25a0ssc \u25a0a a a c_ _ 75 -. - 3 r_ re '-_* OB | \u25a0i. 3 2 _ id -__ >- !> o __ o ft - January - In. 29-90 In. 29'79 In. 29-79 In. 29*76 In. 29 69 In. 29-83 In. 29-71 In. 29-75 In. 29*66 In. 29 61 In. 29*53 In. 29-63 July - 29-80 29-77 29-82 29-83 29-80 29-78 29-77 29'76 29-82 29-77 29*75 29*72"], [32, "14 [chap.

The number of days when it either rains or snows is greatest on the west coast, (there being as many as 200 days in the year) ; and least in the eastern part of the country, where it is less than 100 days. The snowfall increases as the latitude is higher or the altitude greater. From Lofoten to Vardo, and on the Dovre and other mountain ranges, snow is more frequent than rain. Snow falls occasionally in all months of the year from Lofoten to the North Cape.* Fog and mirage. \u2014 On the west and north coasts fogs are frequent in summer, but rare in winter ; the reverse being the case in the interior. In winter a frosty mist hangs over the inner fiords when the cold is severe and the wind off-shore. The appearance known as \" smoke-frost,\" when the whole surface of the sea steams like a lime-kiln, is also common during severe winter weather ; it is caused by the water being relatively warmer than the incumbent air. Mirage is common on the Norwegian coasts in summer, and is generally considered an indication of fine weather ; but when objects are much distorted by it, unsettled weather may be expected.f Thunderstorms are not common in Norway; they occur most frequently in summer, sometimes accompanied by rain and southerly or south-westerly winds ; and sometimes, more especially in the interior, occur ring [on hot sultry days. In winter, heavy south-west and westerly gales are often accompanied by thunder and lightning, which, owing to the low altitude of the clouds, is very dangerous. Between Lister and Vest fiord about 40 churches have been destroyed by lightning during these winter storms in the last 50 years.* CURRENTS. \u2014 The great north-easterly surface drift of the Atlantic, carrying with it the high temperature of the Gulf stream, impinges on the western coast of Norway somewhere about latitude 62\u00b0 N. ; and northward of this parallel, at a distance of 30 to 60 miles from the land, carries a vessel \" Professor H.

ICE. \u2014 Drift ice is never met with on the western and northern coasts of Norway, notwithstanding the vicinity of the great ice-fields ; and the coasting steam vessels ply regularly round the North Cape as far as Vadso, on the north side of Varanger fiord, all through the winter months. During severe winters the inner branches of the larger fiords are frozen over, but the outer ports are accessible throughout the year. On the south coast, the harbours eastward of the Naze are icebound in most winters, but those in its vicinity, especially the outer ports, are generally open, and it is only towards the close of extremely hard winters that the fiords westward of the Naze are obstructed by ice. Floating ice is only met with in spring, when small masses, which, however, are soon dispersed, may be drifted out of Kristiania fiord and the Kattegat, and occasionally from some of the larger fiords to the westward and northward of the Naze. VARIATION Of the COMPASS\u2014 On the passage round the North Cape the variation of the compass ranges from 22\u00b0 W. near Lambaness, the north point of the Shetland islands, to 1\u00b0 40' E. at Vardo, the eastern extreme of Finmarken. About 100 miles west of Rost island, the southernmost of the Lofotens, the variation is 16\u00b0 W., and from thence it decreases rapidly in a north-easterly direction to 3\u00b0 W. at the North Cape ; the line of no variation being in about longitude 30\u00b0 E. The variation is ivestcrly to the westward of the line of no variation, and easterly to the eastward. The annual change of the variation of the compass averages about 10' on the northern coasts of Europe ; westerly variation decreasing ; easterly variation increasing. The amount of variation in 1880 for particular sections of the coast will be found at the head of each chapter. CAUTION. \u2014 When proceeding to the north, a little eastward of the meridian of Greenwich, the variation of the magnetic needle continues nearly the same up to and beyond the parallel of 70\u00b0 N., the lines of equal magnetic variation running nearly N. f E. and S. f W. (true) ; but imme diately on sailing to the eastward the variation begins rapidly, though very regularly, to decrease, a fact which must always be borne in mind when approaching the coast of Norway from the westward, and especially when bound round the North Cape. Too much attention cannot be paid to the compass, especially in iron vessels, and it is strongly recommended that before making the land the deviation should be ascertained on at least the eight principal points. K 740. C"], [36, "18 INTRODUCTION. [chap. I. COAST.* The whole coast of Norway, with the exception of the low lands of J\u00e6deren and Lister, is very irregular, rocky, and steep, presenting the appearance of. a stupendous chain of mountains, with ragged peaks and abrupt points, intersected by numerous fiords or arms of the sea. Many of these fiords are both wide and deep, and being protected by the innumerable islands and rocks which lie along the coast, afford excellent shelter to vessels of every description. When approaching the coast it is difficult at first to identify the islands, as they frequently rise abruptly from the sea to the same elevation as the mainland. On closer observation, the coast presents the appearance of a wild broken shore of gray, rounded, rocky ridges, with smooth sloping surfaces and low promontories ; there are no sands, nor pebble beaches. These promontories are evidently the points of spur ridges, the outermost extremities of the inland mountains in the background, which in clear weather are visible at a great distance. On the south-west coast the character of the scenery is often monotonous, and is comparatively low and tame ; it increases in interest and variety towards the north, and between Trondhjem and Hammerfest presents a panorama of savage grandeur, which is perhaps only rivalled by the coast of South Greenland or the Strait of Magellan. The north coast is distin guished by table-topped, precipitous headlands, about 1,000 feet high, but decreases in height and boldness of outline to the eastward and southward. The navigation of the Norwegian coast is undoubtedly difficult, and requires great caution and promptitude ; the danger is, however, gene rally exaggerated, for although the outlying islands which protect the harbours and make them so safe and commodious also render them difficult of access, yet there are nearly always deep-water channels between the rocks which afford passages for the largest vessels. These channels are often very intricate, but that difficulty is in a great measure obviated by the accuracy of the charts and the certainty of obtaining good pilots. During the summer months, navigation is much facilitated by the length of the days, especially in the more northern parts of the country, where the sun never sets for many weeks ; but in winter, when the nights are propor tionately long, the weather stormy and cloudy, and the landmarks often obscured by snow-storms, or rendered nearly undistinguishable by their uniform covering of snow, it is extremely hazardous and dangerous. Even at this season, however, in the intervals of fine weather, the moon and stars sometimes render all objects distinctly visible, and the aurora borealis occasionally affords sufficient light to read by. * See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Arctic Ocean and Greenland Sea, No. 2,282."], [37, "chap. I.] GENERAL DESCRIPTION \u2014 INNER LEAD. 19 Most of tho islets and rocks above water on the Norwegian coast are steep-to, so that vessels of moderate draught may, as a rule, stand quite close in to the shore when turning through narrow channels. The principal towns between the Naze and Lapland are Farsund, Eker sund, Stavanger, Haugesund, Bergen, Kristiansund, Trondhjem, Bodo, Tromso, Hammerfest, Vardo, and Vadso. INNER LEAD. \u2014 The west and north-west coasts of Norway are fronted by ranges of islands, interspersed with clusters of islets and rocks,* which at some former time probably formed part of the continent, and are now of the greatest importance to it, bearing as they do the whole force of the North Atlantic and Arctic storms, and securing what may be termed an inland navigation, which is continued with little interruption from the Naze to the North Cape. This inshore route is known as the \" Inner Lead \" f or channel, and so completely is it land-locked in many places that it has been compared to a chain of lakes. Some of the passages in the Inner Lead are so narrow and intricate that they should not be attempted by square-rigged vessels, except with a leading wind ; but for steam vessels, and sailing vessels with fore-and-aft rig, this route is generally both safer and more convenient than the open sea, while its numerous anchorages afford refuge in cases of emergency. The number of steam vessels running up and down the coast of Norway all the year through is now very considerable, and is steadily increasing. All these vessels take the Inner Lead. When navigating the Inner Lead under sail, care should be taken to have everything ready for shortening sail at a moment's notice, as sudden and violent squalls often rush down the steep mountain slopes, and the wind is frequently variable and baffling. In winter, when the ropes and sails are often frozen, and the decks slippery with ice, it is safer to carry reduced canvas always, owing to the difficulty of shortening sail smartly under such circumstances. At this season, the snow is the greatest danger to be apprehended, as the storms are so heavy that the land is often com pletely obscured for hours together, though perhaps quite close to the vessel. When likely to be caught in a snow-storm in the Inner Lead, careful * These clusters of low, rounded, rocky islets, which are known as v\u00e6rs, are a singular feature of the Norwegian coast. They vary in height from a few feet above the water to an elevation of 100 feet or more, and in many places lie in long rows parallel to the coast. \" The steamer often works its way amongst them for miles, escaping from the seeming entanglement of monotonous walls of rock by which she is at each instant surrounded in a way truly surprising.\" \u2014 -Professor Forbes. f In Norwegian, ' Ben Indre Led ' or ' Indre Leden ; ' the word \" lead \" is used in pre ference to \" channel \" throughout this work, as it would be more readily understood by the pilots. B2"], [38, "20 INTRODUCTION. [chap. I. bearings of the nearest anchorage should be taken, to enable the vessel to seek shelter. It is dangerous to heave-to, owing to the strength of the tidal streams. A detailed account of the passages and harbours in the Inner Lead is given in the latter part of each chapter, after the description of the outer coast and the entrances from seaward. FIORDS. \u2014 The fiords are arms of the sea, with which the whole coast is indented. On the west coast the Hardanger and Sogne fiords arc the most extensive. Most ofthe fiords in the west of Norway have several branches and tributary streams, where salmon will generally be found. The tidal wave does not proceed far up the fiords on the west coast, and towards their inner recesses the water is nearly fresh, owing to the influx of large rivers. The smaller branches usually freeze in winter, while the main arteries remain open, or are only partially covered with ice. Steam vessels ply all the year round, in winter getting as far up the fiords as the ice will permit. In many of the larger inlets the mountains descend almost perpendicularly to an immense depth ; in Sogne fiord, for instance, a depth of 661 fathoms has been found at a distance of 50 miles from the open sea. In places where the rocks descend abruptly to the water's edge, there is almost always deep water close up to them ; but opposite the numerous small valleys, where the greensward slopes between walls of rock to a sandy or pebbly beach, the water will generally be sound to shoal gradually. Most of the fiords have a much greater depth than the open sea in the vicinity.* BANKS. \u2014 The sea near the mouths of the fiords is shallowed by a series of banks, which extend more or less uniformly all round the Norwegian coast.f Outside these banks, a rocky bottom, strewn with boulders \" whose smooth rounded forms and worn edges clearly enough * Lieut. G. T. Temple, E.N. f The formation of these banks has been attributed to the effects of ancient glaciation. The theory suggested by the works of several eminent geologists and glacialists is that during the period of maximum glaciation the sea was much higher and deeper than at present, and that vast glaciers, laden with moraine rubbish, were thrust out to sea through the valleys, forming a floating barrier of ice far beyond the actual coa^t line. The outer part of this mer de glace being partially thawed from beneath by the action of the salt water, aided by ocean currents, before breaking away in the form of icebergs. left a deposit composed of clay and gravel mixed with stones and boulders ; while the bottom of the fiords farther inland, where the thickness and pressure of the ice must haye been much greater, were eroded by the advancing glaciers, and added by their attrition to the accumulation of debris beyond. In support of this theory, there is abundant evidence of a great rising of the sea or submergence of the land during the glacial epoch ; the traces of glaciation on a vast scale are universal on the Norwegian coast ; and a suggestive confirmation is supplied by the banks themselves."], [39, "21 \u25a0CHAP. I.] FIORDS \u2014 BANKS. show that they have been subjected to the powerful action of ice,\" extends from 60 to 120 miles from the shore, to a depth of 100 to 300 fathoms.* Beyond this the sea rapidly deepens to 1,000 fathoms between Norway and the Faroe islands, and nearly 2,000 fathoms half way between Norway and Iceland. t On the west coast, between Lindesn\u00e6s and Stadt, upwards of 100 fathoms may be found in many places between the outlying rocks and shoals, and even within a short distance of the mainland. Between Stadt and the entrance to the Trondhjems Lead, the 100-fathom line appears to take a wide irregular sweep of about 50 or 60 miles to the westward, returning on the parallel of about 63\u00b0 20' N. to within 5 miles of Smolen island, when it again bends to the northward. Within this space, however, there are several deep fissures or channels, which carry a depth of from 100 to upwards of 150 fathoms close up to the coast. Northward of Trondhjem, where the \" skjergaard,\" or fringe of outlying rocks and reefs, extends from 20 to upwards of 30 miles from the mainland, \" the entire absence of such banks and soundings as usually warn a mariner of his approach to land greatly increases the danger of navigation.\" The depth is generally from 100 to 200 fathoms, and in many instances shoals so rapidly that upwards of 100 fathoms may be found within half a cable of a rock. During heavy gales the sea will break on ground that has 18 or 20 fathoms water on it, particularly if the sea happens to be deep on that side from which the swell comes.J j It is evident that until the banks of the Norwegian coast are carefully examined, the lead will be of little use in making the land. When soundings are obtained in the immediate vicinity of the coast, the bottom is generally found to be soft or clayey ; it is probably composed of \" till \" or glacier deposit. DANGERS- \u2014 In bad weather the sea breaks on nearly all the outer dangers off the coast of Norway. The position of shoals and sunken rocks is often indicated, especially in fine weather, by immense flocks of sea birds, which assemble in pursuit of the small fish frequenting such places ; and the water of the fiords is so transparent and clear that sunken rocks often show as dark patches when seen from a considerable distance. * This would be the region of floating icebergs detached from the outer ice-wall, and these bergs would carry only such boulders, as the lower accumulation of slimy debris would have been washed out before the glacier had reached its final dispersion : W. Mattieu Williams. \\ From Professor Sars' report on the results of the Norwegian North Sea Expedition in 1876. X From Den Norske Vol. viii., 1870."], [40, "22 [chap. I. INTRODUCTION. Most of the dangers in the Inner Lead show themselves, and those in the fairway which are not visible are nearly always marked by beacons. CAUTION* \u2014 Instances having occurred of vessels being driven or obliged to stand in amongst the outer islets and rocks before a pilot could get on board, it may be well to call attention to the fact that the secret of successful navigation among unknown dangers, where the lead is of little use, is to keep the sun astern if possible, and con the vessel from the mast head. The necessity for great caution when approaching the coast during thick or foggy weather cannot be too strongly insisted upon, on account of the absence of soundings, the distance to which the outer dangers extend off-shore, and the general tendency of the current to set towards the laud. Mariners should always endeavour to make some conspicuous landfall, so that, if necessary, they may be able to stand in for one of the easier inlets or harbours without a pilot. PILOTS.* \u2014 The Norwegian pilots, especially those on the southern coasts, are some of the best in the world, and are famed, not only for their skill and judgment, but also for their undaunted courage in venturing out to vessels in distress at the imminent peril of their lives. They are always on the alert when a vessel heaves in sight or makes the usual signal, and will come off when the sea is so high that they are obliged to sling them selves and be hoisted on board. Their boats are decked over, and are admirably adapted for encountering heavy weather, but if unable to come out, they will almost always be found within the outer rocks, where the sea is smoother, and will certainly board the vessel as soon as practicable. The pilots who have passed the Government examination, wear a metal badge, bearing the word \" lods \" (pilot), surmounted by a crown ; they are not allowed to take charge of a vessel beyond the limits of their par ticular districts, and no pilot is allowed to take the same vessel in and out of port. The general coast pilotsf are men who have been employed in the coasting trade ; they are highly spoken of, and some of them are capable of conducting a vessel-of-war round the whole coast ; in winter, however, they are not easily obtained, most of them being then engaged in the fisheries. If bound to the northern parts of the country through the Inner Leads, one or more general coast pilots' should be engaged at some port southward of Namsos. On approaching any part of the Norwegian coast, the signal for a pilot should always be made in good time, as there is frequently some delay in * The pilot stations specified hereafter are taken from the official \" Kystbevogtnings Kart \"' (coastguard chart) supplied by the Norwegian Government. t In Norwegian, \" Kjendt-mand,\" a man acquainted with the coast, and capable of piloting a vessel, but not in Government employ."], [41, "CHAP. I.] 23 PILOTS AND SIGNALS. manning the pilot boats, the men having other occupations. Northward of Leko, in latitude 65\u00b0 N., there are long intervals between the pilot stations ; but many of the islands are inhabited, and should there be no regular pilots on the spot, fishermen will generally be found who are well acquainted with the coast, and are capable of taking charge of a vessel. DISTRESS and PILOT SIGNALS\u2014 The Norwegian Government has given notice, that from the 1st of January 1878, the fol lowing signals shall be shown by vessels when in distress or requiring a pilot : \u2014 DISTRESS SIGNALS: By day. \u2014 The following signals marked Nos. 1, 2, and 3, shall, either together or separately, be employed as signals of distress by day : \u2014 No. 1. \u2014 Guns fired at an interval of about one minute. No. 2. \u2014 The distress signal marked \" N.C.\" in the International Code of Signals. No. 3. \u2014 Distant signal, consisting of a square flag with a ball, or some thing like a ball, over or under the flag. By night. \u2014 -The following signals, marked Nos. 1, 2, and 3, shall, either together or separately, be employed as signals of distress by night : \u2014 No. 1. \u2014 Guns fired at an interval of about one minute. No. 2. \u2014 Flame on the vessel as if from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel, or something of that kind. No. 3. \u2014 Rockets or fireballs of any kind or colour, burned one at a time at short intervals. PILOT SIGNALS. \u2014 By day. \u2014 Instead of those formerly ordered, the following signals, Nos. 1 and 2, shall, either in connexion with one another or alone, be used as pilot signals by day : \u2014 No. 1. \u2014 Jack or national flag hoisted at the fore, and provided with a white border as broad as a fifth part of the whole breadth of the flag. No. 2. \u2014 The pilot signal marked \" P.T.\" in the International Code of Signals. By night. \u2014 Instead of those formerly ordered, the following signals, Nos. 1 and 2, shall, either in connexion with one another or alone, be used as pilot signals by night : \u2014 No. 1. \u2014 The pyrotechnic light, generally known under the name of blue lights, shown every 15th minute. No. 2. \u2014 A bright white light, shown right over the gunwale for about a minute, at brief intervals. TIDES. \u2014 The tides upon the west coast of Norway northward of J\u00e6deren and Skudesn\u00e6s are produced by a tidal wave which advances from south-west to north-east, making high water at Fuglen\u00e6s (Hammerfest) somewhat later than at Skudesn\u00e6s. The flood stream is probably"], [42, "24 INTRODUCTION. [chap. I. strongest at 3 hours before high water, weakest (and in many places ebbing) at 3 hours after high water. Between the Naze and J\u00e6deren the rise is almost imperceptible, but increases steadily to the northward. Springs rise 4\\ feet at Stavanger, 6 to 7 feet at Kristiansund and in Froi fiord, 8 to 9 feet at Tromso, and upwards of 9 feet at Fugle\u00e6us (Hammerfest). The flood stream generally sets north-eastward and the ebb south-westward on the west coast of Norway, but frequent irregularities are occasioned by the bends of the coast, the numerous islands which obstruct the direct course of the streams, and the influence of strong winds. During south-westerly and westerly gales both streams set continuously to the northward, aud with strong and continuous easterly winds to the southward. In the latter case, however, the tidal stream is less rapid, and when the flood should be making, is almost imperceptible. The flood, or north-east going stream is always stronger than the ebb, but the rate and duration of both are influenced by the winds.* More detailed information as to the nature of the tides will be found hereafter. CAUTION. \u2014 In the narrower channels between the islands the tidal streams often run with great velocity, and strict attention must be paid to their force and direction when navigating the Inner Lead, many vessels having been wrecked or stranded, solely through neglect of this precaution. LIGHTS. \u2014 The west coast of Norway, including the most frequented channels in the Inner Lead, is now well lighted. The lighthouses in the Inner Lead are small painted wooden buildings, the lights being exhibited from balconies or one of the angles of the houses. BEACONS and BUOYS.\u2014 The Norwegian Government has given notice that, with a view to the adoption of a general system for beacons and buoys on the coast of Norway, the following alterations will shortly be made : \u2014 Beacons Or Landmarks. \u2014 Fixed landmarks, iron poles and pillars, will be provided with arms indicating the side on which the navigable channel lies. When there is deep water on both sides the beacons will be provided with two arms, one on each side. Beacons much exposed to heavy seas will not be provided with arms. Floating marks.\u2014 White poles.\u2014 A white pole with a broom turned upwards denotes that the shallow water lies north or east of the mark. Black poles. \u2014 A black pole with a broom turned downwards denotes that the shallow water lies south or west of the mark. * From the Norwegian Almanac, 1879, and other sources."], [43, "CHAP. I.] TIDES \u2014 ANCHORAGES. 25 Striped poles. \u2014 A pole with white and black horizontal stripes and with a ball attached, denotes that vessels may pass on either side. Buoys. \u2014 The buoys will be painted red, but provided with poles of the colour and description above mentioned. As a commencement of the intended system, the floating marks on the south coast between the Swedish frontier and Lister will, from the 1st June 1877, be altered in conformity with the above notice. The so-termed \" staff and broom \" beacons are, properly speaking, small poles with a bundle of sticks or twigs on the top ; but in many places, particularly in the south of Norway, they have been replaced by poles surmounted by cones or balls. The term \" staff and broom \" is, however, generally applied to all floating marks, except buoys, and has been adhered to throughout this work. CAIRNS. \u2014 Numerous stone beacons or cairns have been erected on the islets off the west coast of Norway as leading marks for the various channels. These small beacons are particularly useful, as it is often difficult to ascertain a vessel's exact position, especially in thick weather, owing to the great similarity df many of the smaller islands. Anchorage will frequently be found near these cairns. MOORING RINGS.\u2014 In the centres of the black and white circles, resembling targets, which are painted on the rocks at intervals along the whole coast of Norway, rings or \"|\"\"irons will be found ; they may be used either for mooring or warping. Anchorage is generally to be found opposite these rings, but in some places they are only intended for fishing vessels and small craft to make fast to when drifting to leeward in calm weather. A small tax is levied for the use of mooring rings in some of the principal harbours.* ANCHORAGE. \u2014 As a general rule, the harbours on the Norwegian coast are small ; some of them appear to be mere notches, as it were, in the base of a lofty mountain, the entrances being invisible at a short distance. They generally, however, appear smaller than they are in reality, owing to the difficulty of judging heights and distances in Norway by the eye ; this arises probably from the gigantic scale of the scenery, and the general absence of any objects whose known dimension gives a scale of magni tude by which to form an estimate. These small coves, when measured, will often be found to include a considerable area, and many of them would afford shelter to one or two large vessels, though^few are capable of accom modating a fleet. It has been observed that the ground generally slopes * In 1864, H.M.S. Racoon rode out a heavy gale with terrific squalls, in Holmens Havn, Bergen ; the whole strain was borne by her stern fasts, and severely tried the ring she was secured to, but all held on. \u2014 Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Racoon, 1864."], [44, "26 NORWAY PILOT. [chap. I. more or less to the westward on the west coast of Norway ; therefore, in unsettled weather experienced coasters consider it safer to anchor on the west side of the harbours, and run out shore hawsers to the eastward ; a westerly gale would then only tend to drive a vessel farther up the bank, and easterly gales are not so much to be dreaded. As a rule, it is advisable to moor with shore hawsers in all the smaller harbours.* As the majority of anchorages on this coast are close to the shore, on account of the great depth in the fiords, a perfect understanding with the pilot is necessary as to the berth to be taken up. Being used to small craft, which always haul their sterns in to the shore rings, the pilots will often run large vessels into small corners, and secure them by the stern in the same way as the coasters. This is to be avoided, if possible, under all high land, on account of the heavy squalls that strike down, even in fine weather.f ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\u2014 A submarine telegraph cable extends from Peterhead, on the east coast of Scotland, to Ekersund, and as there are numerous telegraph stations along the whole coast of Norway, messages can always be forwarded or vessels numbers reported. The tele graph cables cross the fiords in many places, and notice boards are placed on the rocks on each side, close to the water's edge, to indicate their direction ; vessels should never anchor between these boards, as by doing so, they run the risk of damaging the cables and losing their own anchors. THE NORTH SEA.J The NORTH SEA, or GERMAN OCEAN, is bounded on the west by the British Isles, on the east by Norway and Denmark, on the south by Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France, and on the north by the Shetland isles and the northern or Arctic ocean. The term \" German Ocean,\" though in common use, is not so comprehensive in its application to this extensive basin as that of \"North Sea,\" now more generally used by navigators. Lying between the parallels of 51\u00b0 and 61\u00b0 N., and the meridians of 2\u00b0 30' W., and 7\u00b0 30' E., its greatest length is about 600 miles, and its breadth (from St. Abb's head to the opposite shore of Denmark) 360 miles. The shores of the North Sea are indented by bays, fiords, islets, and estuaries ; and the Skagerrak, an arm of it dividing Denmark from Norway, communicates, through the Kattegat, with the Baltic. * Lieut.

I.] 27 NORTH SEA, GENERAL DIRECTIONS. The North Sea is irregular in form, being divided into two unequal portions by a line drawn from Cromer to the Texel. The northern part is contained between generally bold and clear shores, and possesses a com parative uniformity of depth ; the southern section, on the contrary, differs in every respect from the northern one ; in no part of it is there a depth exceeding 30 fathoms, for while limited in area, it is the receptacle for the matters discharged by several rivers of magnitude, such as the Thames, Schelde, and Maas, and the deposit of ages is now seen in the masses of sand which encumber it. The greatest depression in the North Sea is upon the Norwegian side, where depths of 150 to 200 fathoms are common, and though the bottom of the whole basin is irregular, the depth increases on proceeding from south to north, and thus exhibits the characteristic features of a great bay. It may also be mentioned as a general fact, that there is a greater depth of water on the eastern and western sides of the North Sea than in its central parts, and also, on the whole, it is deeper on the British than on the con tinental shores, that of Norway only excepted. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The navigation is the most diffi- cult in the southern portion of the North Sea, partly arising from the bounding shores being so low as seldom to be visible from a greater distance than 10 or 12 miles, even iu clear weather : this, taken in connection with the prevalence of fogs and misty weather during certain portions of the year, imparts to the navigation a critical character, and renders necessary the utmost caution and patient vigilance on the part of the mariner, a fact abundantly evidenced by the number of wrecks which annually takes place within its limits. Modern surveys have made the shores of the North Sea, its shallows, and its tides, generally well known, but it is greatly to be desired that the facts connected with its features and with the practice of its navigation were more generally transmitted to the Hydrographer to the Admiralty ; for, were this the case, public charts and other documents would attain an excellence which they cannot otherwise possess. It is manifest, also, that no book of sailing directions for the North Sea can be made so perfect in itself as to supersede the necessity for great caution on the part of the navigator using it. Thus, his palladium will be found to be the lead, log, and look-out, and on the attention bestowed upon them will principally depend the safety of the vessel. Other practical precautions, such as having a second anchor always ready to let go, will, of course, present themselves to the mind of the seaman. While closing the coasts, either to the eastward or to the westward, due allowance must be made for current, and when in uncer-"], [46, "28 [CHAP. I- NORWAY PILOT. tainty as to position, it must be held far safer to heave-to than to run on, or, in case of falling into shallow water, to anchor rather than keep under way ; the loss of a few hours in the passage, or the trouble of weighing an anchor, ought never, for a single moment, to be allowed to weigh against the risk of perilling life and property. WEATHER. \u2014 A steady attention to the barometer, and to the com mon indications of weather in the North Sea, will be found extremely useful. A few of these latter, contained in a manual of the barometer compiled by the late Admiral Fitzroy, and published by the Board of Trade, may be mentioned here. Whether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages fine weather ; a fed sky in the morning, bad weather, or much wind (perhaps rain) ; a gray sky in the morning, fine weather ; a high dawn, wind ; a low dawn, fair weather. Soft-looking or delicate clouds foretell fine weather, with moderate or light breezes ; hard edged, oily-looking clouds, wind ; a dark gloomy blue sky is windy, but a light bright blue sky indicates fine weather. Generally the softer clouds look, the less wind (but perhaps more rain) may be expected ; and the harder, more \"greasy,\" rolled, tufted, or ragged, the stronger the coming wind will prove. Also, a bright yellow sky at sunset presages wind, pale yellow, wet ; and thus, by the prevalence of red, yellow, or gray tints, the coming weather may be foretold very nearly ; indeed, if aided by instruments, almost exactly. Small inky -looking clouds foretell rain ; light scud clouds driving across heavy masses show wind and rain, but, if alone, may indicate wind only. High upper clouds crossing the sun, moon, or stars, in a direc tion different from that of the lower clouds, or the wind then felt below, foretell a change of wind. When sea birds fly out early, and far to seaward, moderate wind and fair weather may be expected ; when they hang about the land, or over it, some times flying inland, expect a strong wind with stormy weather. There are other signs of a coming change in the weather known less generally than may be desirable, and therefore worth notice, such as when birds of long flight \u2014 rooks, swallows, or others \u2014 hang about home, and fly up and down, or low, rain or wind may be expected. Dew is an indication of fine weather, so is fog. Neither of these two formations occur under an overcast sky, or when there is much wind. Fog is occasionally rolled away, as it were, by wind, but seldom or never formed while it is blowing. BANKS. \u2014 Among the principal sand banks with which the North Sea is encumbered, is that known to seamen as the Long Forties, which trends from the Firth of Forth in a north-easterly direction for about 120 miles, while the Jutland banks may be traced for upwards of 100 miles in"], [47, "CHAP. I.] 29 NORTH SEA; WEATHER \u2014 CURRENT. a westerly direction from Jutland. The great central mass, known under the common appellation of the \" Dogger bank,\" is subdivided into the Long bank, White bank, and Well bank. There are, besides, a great number of shoals and sand banks lying southward of the line joining Flamborough head and Heligoland, which are too numerous to be particularised here ; it may, however, be mentioned that on the coasts of Britain, France, and Belgium, they generally assume the form of ridges running in a direction nearly parallel to the shore or the tidal streams, while the coast of North Holland alone is fronted by a broad flat ; their boundaries will be best understood by referring to the Admiralty chart. CURRENT.* \u2014 The current in the North Sea is sensibly affected by the winds, but in general inclines towards the N.E., a circumstance par ticularly necessary to be attended to, as calculated to set mariners bound from the British shores towards the opposite coast beyond their reckoning, and thereby to endanger their vessels by coming too soon upon the shoals which line the shore. Those, therefore, who sail from the westward in order to make any part of the coast between the Texel and the Skaw should look out for land in time, as it is common in making it to find the distance apparently from 20 to 30 miles less than when sailing the contrary way. This particularly happens with winds from the south-west quarter, when the current sets constantly to the east and north-eastward, generally across the Jutland bank and the south side of the Skagerrak towards the Skaw, but some times, varying with the wind, trending towards the coast of Norway. The current along the coast of Jutland, north of Bovenbergen (Bovbierg) and Agger, sets about 2 miles an hour with westerly winds ; and with strong S.S.W. gales more than 3 miles. Between Jutland bank and the coast of Norway, the current generally sets to the westward, even with westerly winds, and at the same time the current on the Jutland coast sets eastward towards the Skaw ; but with northerly and north-westerly winds it sets to the southward along the coast of Norway, across the Jutland bank, and along the coast of Jutland towards Heligoland. This current runs at the rate of li or 2 miles an hour during strong winds, and requires particular attention. A very uncertain current sets between the Naze of Norway and the Orkney islands, and as some of these islands are low, and frequently obscured from view by fog and mist, great caution is necessary when approaching them. This current follows the direction of the wind, par ticularly when it blows from the southward or northward, but generally runs strongest to the northward. As the wind continues the current increases, and after long continued south-west winds, sometimes runs more * See Description of tidal streams in the North Sea, contained in Admiralty Tide- Tables."], [48, "30 NORWAY PILOT. [chap. than 2 miles an hour midway between the Naze and Orkneys. Easterly or westerly winds blowing athwart this current sometimes render it almost insensible in the offing, and within 9 or 12 miles of the Orkneys and Shetlands the tidal streams take their regular course. It has frequently been observed, when sailing from the Naze to Fair island, that the distance has appeared from 15 to 20 miles shorter than that shown on the chart ; this must be occasioned by south-easterly winds causing a current to the northward and westward. Prom the THAMES to NORWAY.\u2014 As the banks in the North Sea occupy large portions of ground, somewhat shoaler in general than the parts surrounding them, soundings, when carefully taken, tend materially to assist in verifying the vessel's position. The force and direction of the wind, the tides, and the proximity of the land must also be taken into consideration. Vessels bound northward from the Thames may pass between the Shipwash and Galloper sands, or if from the Downs, between the latter and the Kentish Knock, and gairi the open sea either eastward or westward of the Gabbard sands, according to circumstances. Vessels eastward of the Goodwin, after passing the North Sand Head light-vessel at a distance of about 3 miles, and nearly midway between it and the Falls Tail, should steer about N.E. by N. for 26 miles, passing between the Drill stone (a ledge with 7 fathoms over a rocky bottom, causing a strong ripple), and the Fall head, about 5 miles eastward of the Kentish Knock light-vessel, and 3 miles westward of that of the Galloper. The depths of water in this track will be from 27 to 17 fathoms, and the direction of the tidal stream nearly in the same line. Those whose draught will admit of crossing the shoal parts of the Falls may, with attention to the lead, skirt this ridge close up to the Galloper, as it is steep to on either side ; but if of heavy burden, they should be careful to avoid the shoal parts. Vessels working to the northward, eastward of the Falls, should be careful to avoid the Sandettie, on which are strong ripplings, and in fresh breezes a heavy sea, which breaks on the shoalest part. Farther north ward they should not stand to the eastward of a line joining the Fairy and North Hinder banks, and it will be prudent for those of large draught to keep to the northward of the red buoy,* to avoid the shoal part of the latter bank. From a distance of about 4 miles eastward of the Galloper, a N.E. \\ N. course will lead to the northward across the parallel of 53\u00b0 N., and about midway between Brown ridge and Smith's Knoll. In this track the soundings will be from about 30 to 20 fathoms. As the depths over Brown ridge and those eastward of it are from 11 to 15 * The position of this buoy cannot always be depended upon."], [49, "31 CHAP. I.] DIRECTIONS. fathoms, with deeper water between and immediately eastward of them, by attention to the lead they form an excellent guide when in this vicinity. The general depths at from 6 to 8 miles eastward of these ridges to the 10 fathoms line of soundings off the coast of Holland are from 14 to 11 fathoms, and this space is known as the Broad Fourteens ; whilst for 40 miles westward of the ridges, from 16 to 28 fathoms water will be found, the deepest water being to the westward. Continuing the course N.E i N. in 14 to 21 fathoms water, a vessel will cross the parallel of 54\u00b0 N. eastward of the Outer Silver pit, at the south end of the Dogger bank. The Outer Silver pit extends nearly 40 miles eastward of the meridian of 2\u00b0 East, and 18 miles west of it, and has depths of 21 to 44 fathoms, with a small patch of 17 fathoms about one third its length from the east end. The same course will probably carry a vessel over a 17-fathoms patch eastward of the Outer Silver pit, and in 20 to 26 fathoms water to the north-east end of the Dogger bank, in latitude 55\u00b0 30' N., where the soundings will be 17 and 18 fathoms. DOGGER BANK.\u2014 This bank, within the depth of 20 fathoms, extends about 140 miles in a north-east and south-west direction, and its greatest breadth, which is at its south-west end, is about 65 miles. The bank has from 7 to 20 fathoms water over it, the shoalest part being in the centre ofthe south-west end in latitude 54\u00b0 28' N, longitude 1\u00b0 41' E.* About 20 miles northward of the north-east end of the Dogger bank, on the parallel of 56\u00b0 N., and about 1 20 miles from the coast of Jutland, is the 30-fathoms lines of soundings. In all cases it is better to keep well to the westward, to counteract the effect of any easterly current, as the coast of Jutland is low and not easily seen from a distance. If necessary, the shoals near the coast may be avoided by skirting the 30-fathoms line of soundings, which curves round Hantsholmen lighthouse at a distance of nearly 20 miles. From Bovenbergen (Bovberg) to the Skaw, the land, when seen, may be recognised, and soundings obtained. The most advisable route for sailing vessels bound round the North Cape is that between the Orkney and Shetland islands, from whence a course should be shaped so as to pass at least 100 miles west of Eost island, the southernmost of the Lofoten group. f * The rather general impression that the shoal water on this extensive bank had become still shoaler, and dangerous to shipping, has been dispelled by Staff-Captain Parsons in H.M. surveying vessel Porcupine, 1875, who did not find less than 7 fathoms ; this depth corresponding with that found by Captains Hewitt and Washington, in 1832 and 1842 respectively. f Directions for making the passage from the Downs to\" the White Sea, 1858."], [50, "32 NORWAY PILOT [chap. I. HOMEWARD ROUTE.\u2014 Vessels bound from the Sleeve or Skagerrak to the Thames should steer well to the northward, keep the Skagerrak open, and avoid the coast of Jutland. In working, stand toward the coast of Norway, and not southward of the edge of the bank of soundings, until as far westward as the Naze ; the current near this part of the Norwegian coast sets to the westward, but does not extend far from the land. After passing the Naze the effects of the current will soon be felt, and seamen must act according to the direction and force of the wind, taking care not to stand to the southward of Agger, especially with north-westerly winds, until they are well to the westward, in order to avoid the Horn reefs ; by keeping the Sleeve open they will also avoid being embayed, and will be able, in case of emergency, to bear up for some port in Norway. In winter, mariners are strongly recommended to make the coast of Yorkshire somewhere about Flamborough head, thus avoiding Yarmouth sands, and having a good departure to clear the Leman and Ower. As the 30-fathoms line of soundings runs in a W.' by S. direction from the entrance of the Skagerrak almost to Flamborough head, it is an excellent guide to vessels taking this route. By not going to the southward into a less depth, or to the northward into a greater depth, a vessel will make Flamborough head, where a rocket is discharged every 10 minutes during thick weather, exploding with a loud report. Vessels of heavy draught, however, generally steer outside the Leman and Ower light-vessel, and make the land between Lowestoft and Orfordness, where the soundings are regular, and the shore can be approached to within a prudent distance. In approaching the coast of Norfolk, should a vessel get soundings on the Swarte or Broken banks they will indicate her proximity to the Leman and Ower, when a sight of the light-vessel stationed on the latter bank may be obtained ; and farther to the southwest, in 24 to 26 fathoms water, great caution should be observed in standing to the westward until the vessel is southward of Smith's Knoll. VARIATION Of the COMPASS. \u2014 In the North Sea generally the lines of equal magnetic variation run in a N. J E. and S. | W. (true) direction, and range in value from 18i\u00b0 W. in the river Thames at Greenwich, to 13|\u00b0 W. at the Skaw, the decrease being gradual in pro ceeding from West to East. At the present time the variation throughout the North Sea is decreasing annually from 8' to 10'. The variation in London and its vicinity for every 10 years of the present century, as given in the annexed Table, indicates the nature of the changes which have taken place during those periods ; corresponding corrections from the present time for the eastern shores of the North Sea should be applied, if charts of an early date uncorrected for changes of variation are employed."], [51, "33 chap, i.] DIRECTIONS \u2014 THE NAZE.

The land about the Naze, owing to its height and rugged outlines, is not easily distinguished from any considerable distance in the offing, but as the coast is neared and the foreshores show themselves, F\u00e6ro beacon, and Gunnarshaug and Naze lighthouses gradually appear, and render a mistake all but im possible in ordinarily clear weather. Northward of the Naze, a little inland, is the high land of Spangereid, which is generally covered with snow in the spring, and in clear weather may be seen at a distance of 36 miles from the coast. The N\u00e6skongerne are three knolls on Spangereid, about 2 miles north-eastward of the Naze lighthouse. LIGHT. \u2014 The Naze lighthouse, is a circular tower exhibiting a revolving white light, which attains its greatest brilliancy every minute. The light is elevated 159 feet, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 22 miles ; in ordinary weather the eclipses do not appear total within a distance of 12 miles. The tower is 36 feet high ; its base is of white stone, and the upper part of iron, painted red, which renders it a conspicuous landmark. At night. \u2014 Care should be taken not to bring the Naze light to bear southward of S.E. by E. when approaching from the westward, in order to clear the dangers off the entrance to Farsund. If coming from the east ward the light must be kept to the northward of N.W., in order to avoid the Gjeslingerne. GJESLINGERNE. \u2014 The Gjeslingerne are two dangerous rocks lying S.E. by E., \\ E., distant 5 miles from the Naze ; they are above water, and the sea constantly breaks on them. There is a good passage between the Gjeslingerne and Udvaare island. Vaarekletterne, Ameflua, and Ostboen are shoals carry- ing from 4 to 10 fathoms, which extend about one mile southward and eastward from the Gjeslingerne. Marku, kept just northward of the Naze lighthouse, leads southward of these shoals. * See Admiralty plan : \u2014 Ports on south coast of Norway, No. 2,260, aud Admiralty chart :\u2014 Norway, south coast, sheet I., The Naze to Christiansand, No. 2,327.

HARBOURS EAST of the NAZE.\u2014 The south coast of Norway, from the Naze eastward, is described in Part I. of the Norway Pilot, but as circumstances may render it advisable for northward bound vessels to seek shelter eastward of the Naze, a brief account of the nearest available anchorages is here appended. Vessels making the Naze in the daytime from the westward with a strong westerly gale, and being compelled to seek shelter in some harbour to the eastward, should steer so as to pass at a distance of 3 or 4 cables from the point, in order to obtain a pilot. If no pilot comes out, it will be best to stand towards the Gjeslingerne until Spangereid church is hidden, when the vessel will be nearly abreast of the Langeboerne, and after passing southward of these rocks, which are indicated by breakers if the sea is at all rough, course may be altered either for the north or south point of Udvaare island, the southernmost of the Vaare group. VAARE ISLANDS, about 5 miles eastward of the Naze, are nearly as high as the adjacent land, and resemble a lofty promontory until they are neared sufficiently for the channels between them to be distinguished. RyvingbO, a rock carrying 8\u00a3 fathoms, lies W. by N. f N. 4 cables from Mittingen, a small islet off the north point of Udvaare island. LeVSObO, which carries 2\\ fathoms, lies a good cable S.W. from Kaferhoft. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels passing northward of Udvaare island must keep in mid-channel between Kaferhoft and Mittingen, in order to clear Levsobo and a rock carrying 2 feet which lies about three-quarters of cable N.N.W. from Mittingen. The south side of Udvaare island may be passed within a distance of 2 cables. When well past Udvaare, haul up to about N.E. by N. for Unnero, (on which there is a hill resembling a sugar loaf,) until sheltered by the Vaare islands ; here the offing is open and clear, and there is room for standing off and on, or lying-to for a pilot, who will probably come off from Svinor or Snigs fiord. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage south of Indvaare island in from 7 to 18 fathoms, over sand and clay; the harbour is small, and there are no mooring rings, but hawsers can be made fast to the rocks. Entering from the southward and westward, keep close to the west sides of Skarvo and Kjeholm. Saltholm beacon- in line with the south-east point of Indvaare, will lead northward of the shoals on the south side of the north east entrance. REMESVIG, about 2 miles northward of Indvaare, is the first good harbour eastward of the Naze available for vessels driven in by stress of weather. There are passages east and west of the Ims islands to the anchorages, which may be used by vessels of all sizes. Merchant vessels"], [53, "CHAP. I.] 35 HARBOURS EAST OP THE NAZE. generally anchor off Svennevig, in from 16 to 18 fathoms; vessels of war may anchor north of the Buan rocks, in 27 fathoms ; and small craft in \u0152afsvig, where there are 9 fathoms, and several mooring rings ; there is good holding ground in all these anchorages, the bottom consisting of stiff clay. Svinor. \u2014 About one mile N.N.E. of Indvaare, between Svinor and the mainland, is a good small harbour, with a depth of 9 to 16 fathoms ; it may be entered either from the eastward or westward. The eastern entrance to Svinor is marked by a black beacon with two white crosses Two shoals in the western entrance are marked by pole beacons. SYRDALS FIORD, north-eastward of Svinor, has anchorage in from 20 to 30 fathoms over good holding ground. Vessels of war may ride here conveniently. Tommasboen and Syrdalsflua are marked by pole beacons. Kvaa fiord. \u2014 Vessels may anchor in any part of Kvaa fiord, about 3 miles eastward of Svinor, in from 20 to 22 fathoms over clay. MANDAL. \u2014 The trading town of Mandal, with a population of 4,100, is built at the mouth of Mandal river, which flows into Manne fiord, an inlet about 14 miles eastward of the Naze. An English vice consul is resident, and supplies may be obtained. Anchorage. \u2014 The so-termed Mandals-Havn, or harbour, is nothing more than a small estuary, which is so shallow that only very small vessels can use it ; the following anchorages are, however, situated close to the town. Eleven. \u2014 To the eastward of Mandal, between Gismero and the mainland, is a good harbour named Klevenshavn, where the largest vessels might anchor in from 25 to 13 fathoms. As the harbour is too small for the numerous vessels that make for this port in stormy weather, it is necessary to moor with shore hawsers. Klevenshavn may be left with all winds from S.W. through north to East, and is therefore specially useful to vessels forced to seek shelter by contrary winds ; it frequently happens, however, that in fine summer weather, when it blows a moderate north east gale in the morning from the land at Tr\u00e6gde fiord, a few miles farther east, it is calm, or the wind is south-easterly, at Kleven ; in the afternoon the sea breeze sets in, and prevents vessels getting out. There are two good ship-yards on Gismero, where vessels in want of repairs can be accommodated. Kleven is a good harbour for wintering in . RiSOrbank harbour, about a mile westward of Mandal, takes its name from a bank extending from Riso to Aspholm ; this anchorage is best adapted to eastward bound vessels, and owing to the bank, on which there are only 3 fathoms, is only accessible to vessels of less than 18 feet draught. Risbbo, north-westward of Riso, is marked by an iron pole. C 2"], [54, "[chap. I. 36 NORWAY PILOT. ORLOGSRED (Man-of-War Road) is a tolerably good roadstead eastward of Risdrbank; the depth varies from 5 to 12 fathoms over sand. Vessels may either ride here at single anchor, or moor with their own anchors ; but it is difficult to get under weigh, even with a fair wind, when it blows hard, owing to the current and baffling gusts off the land. A sunken rock immediately northward of Hatholm is marked by a pole. Buskebo, a 4-fathoms patch of rocky ground half a cable in diameter, lies 2\\ cables E.S.E. of Aspholm. LIGHTS.\u2014 Ryvingen.\u2014 On the south-west part of Ryvingen, a conspicuous islet on the east side of the entrance to Manne fiord, stands a tower painted yellow, 37 feet high, which exhibits, from an elevation of 129 feet, a fixed -white light, varied by a red flash every half minute, which should be visible 14 miles in clear weather. Hatholm. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 60 feet, is shown from the east point of Hatholm, 2\\ miles N. by W. \\ W. from Ryvingen ; it is visible 8 miles in clear weather, when bearing from N. by E. \\ E. through west and south to S.S.E. The bearing N. by E. \\ E. leads eastward of Springen. Beacon. \u2014 On the summit of Ryvingen is a pyramid, painted yellow, 30 feet high. Pilots are generally on the look out at the Ryvingen beacon. Stens rocks, which carry 7 feet, lie three-quarters of a cable from each other, and 7\\ cables south-westward of Svartskjer, the southern rock on the west side of the entrance to Manne fiord. There is a beacon on the eastern rock. Springen rock, which lies S.E. distant 4 cables from the south point of Storo, dries in calm weather, and breaks if the sea is rough ; a shoal extends about one cable northward and eastward from Springen. Storeskjer, off the south-east side of Storo, is above water. Bjdrneskjer, 1\\ cables eastward of Hatholm, is marked by an iron pillar 10 feet high, with a white top. DIRECTIONS.\u2014- The position of Mandal may be known by two knolls or hills known as Koen and Kalven (cow and calf), situated about a mile eastward of the town ; and there is a strip of yellow sand westward of the river, which may be seen from a considerable distance. On first rounding the Naze, Koen and Kalven will be hidden by Hilleoen, which is rather lofty, but the beacon on Ryvingen will be sufficient guide for the entrance to Manne fiord. After passing either northward or south ward of Gjeslingerne and Vaarekletterne, Ryvingen lighthouse, or beacon, kept northward of E. by S. will lead southward of Stens rocks, and when Kalven is half way between Storeskjer and Kua, vessels may either steer so as to pass between Storeskjer and Springen, or they may stand"], [55, "CHAP. I.] 37 HARBOURS EAST OF THE NAZE. towards Ryvingen until Manne fiord is well open, then steer for Hatholm, passing eastward of Springen, and proceed for the most convenient anchorage. At night. \u2014 A vessel will be southward of Gjeslingerne and Vaare kletterne as long as the Naze light is northward of N.W. ; and Ryvingen light bearing East will lead well southward of Vaarekletterne and Stens rocks. After passing westward of Ryvingen light, which may be approached within 3 or 4 cables, steer direct for Hatholm light, keeping it to the westward of N. by E. E. until well past Springen ; pass within one cable of the east side of Hatholm in order to avoid Bjorneskjer, and then steer about N. by W. ; the anchor may be let go in the Man-of-War Road as soon as Hatholm light bears South, about 3 cables distant."], [56, "38 CHAPTER II.

COAST-* \u2014 From the Naze to Ekersund the coast trends generally N.W. by N., and, with the exception of the low projecting plain of Lister, the intermediate land is high, and may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 30 to 40 miles. There is no \" Inner Lead\" between Lister and J\u00e6deren's Rev, but several of the intermediate fiords afford good shelter. CURRENT. \u2014 The general direction of the current on the south west coast of Norway is north-westerly, but it varies with the wind, and between the Naze and Lister is very uncertain, sometimes setting right on to the coast. Tides. \u2014 The rise of tide is not perceptible southward of J\u00e6deren's Rev. THE NAZE, Or LINDESN\u00c6S, isa most important landfall to make when approaching the south coast of Norway. It has already been mentioned (page 33) that the land about the Naze is not easily recog nised from a distance, but on nearing it, in addition to the Naze lighthouse and the N\u00e6skon\u00e6me the following landmarks will enable seamen to ascertain their position. LANDMARKS. \u2014 F\u00e6ro beacon, a square white tower with a red roof and a staff and ball on the top, stands on the summit of F\u00e6ro at the entrance to Farsund, 8 miles north-westward of the Naze. Gun narshaug lighthouse, a white stone tower, 102 feet high, stands on the west extreme of the low land of Lister, about 16 miles N.W. of the Naze. GRONS FIORD. t \u2014 Vessels approaching the Naze from the west ward, if obliged to seek shelter before a pilot can get on board, may stand in close to the point and enter Gronsfiord, leaving all the rocks and breakers on the port hand. * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Norway, south coast, sheet 1, The Naze to Christiansand, No. 2,327, and Norway, south-west coast, The Naze to Karmo, No. 2,281. f See plan : \u2014 Approaches to anchorages between the Naze and Farsund on Admiralty chart No. 883, scale m= 1-5 inches (in course of preparation). _"], [57, "CHAP, n.] ISLANDS WEST OF THE NAZE. 39 BISPEN ROCK, about 11 miles W.N.W. from the Naze light house, is the southernmost of all the dangers to the westward of the Naze ; it is a small round rock, and in rough weather the sea breaks constantly on the shoals northward and eastward of it. SVENNERNE.\u2014 These rocks lie about 3\u00a3 cables west of Skaare Bierg, the high land north of the Naze, and are always indicated by breakers. HUNDINGSLANDSVIG.\u2014 If the wind has so much southing in it that a heavy sea follows the vessel into Gronsfiord, she may pass east ward of the Svennerne rocks and Stutvig islets, and run on to Hundings landsvig, about 3^ miles northward of the Naze, where there is good anchorage and smooth water, and where a pilot may be obtained. The harbour is small, but shore hawsers can be made fast to the rocks or trees. Vessels may pass close eastward of Riva, a small islet 2 cables southward of Hundingslandsvig, and steer direct for the entrance of the harbour. AspelskjerbO is a 2-fathom patch about one cable N.E. of Aspelskjer, a rock off the north end of R\u00e6vo. Rivaflak is a patch of foul ground extending about one cable W.S.W. from Riva. To pass between these shoals to Hundingslandsvig, give Aspelskjer a berth of about 2 cables ; then steer for the two beacons on Strandjord, and when Riva is in line with the west point of Ford, course may be altered for the entrance of the harbour. There are several other bights in Gronsfiord, but they are only suitable for fishing vessels and small craft. LUNDEGAARDSTEN is the outermost of the rocks lying out side the islets in Lundegaardsbugt, immediately northward of R\u00e6vo. Rsevobo is a shoal off the north-east point of R\u00e6vo ; the northern extreme of this shoal, over which there is one fathom, is marked by an iron pole. To enter R\u00e6vosund, pass between Aspelskjerbo and Rivaflak ; keep the sound well open in order to clear Lundegaardsten, and hug the mainland when passing R\u00e6vobo. ISLANDS WEST of the NAZE\u2014 Among the cluster of islands lying immediately westward of the Naze, at the entrance to Grons fiord, viz., Marko, S\u00e6lo, Kjepso, R\u00e6vo, and others of less importance, there are several good anchorages, which, with the exception of S\u00e6lor Havn, are usually included under the general appellation of Korshavn. It must be left to the pilot's discretion to avail himself of the most suitable of these anchorages, according to circumstances, and the size ofthe vessel."], [58, "40 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II. Landmark. \u2014 On the summit of Marko, 420 feet above high water, a lighthouse still remains, in which a coal fire was formerly kept up as a beacon light ; its use has been discontinued since the improvement of the Naze light. PILOTS. \u2014 Vessels may stand in close to Marko in order to obtain a pilot, and proceed according to circumstances. S\u00c6LOR HAVN, between S\u00e6lo and S\u00e6lhobden, has anchorage for about 15 vessels, in 6 fathoms, over clay and sand; the holding ground, however, is not to be relied upon, and as southerly and south-westerly gales send in a heavy swell, vessels using this harbour should always keep hawsers clear for laying out to the rings on shore, in case they should be wanted. Vessels of 18 to 20 feet draught may take the passage between Marko and S\u00e6lo, but the southern entrance to S\u00e6lor Havn has only a depth of 17 or 18 feet. To avoid a rock with about one foot of water over it, which lies in the middle ofthe south bight of the harbour, keep the east point of Fold just open to the westward of the point on the east side of the entrance. DANGERS. \u2014 The following dangers must be avoided when making S\u00e6lor Havn from the north-westward or southward : \u2014 Danmarksflue, at the termination of a shoal extending one cable N.N.W. from the north point of Marko, is always awash. TyvebO, with 4 feet over it, lies 1^ cables N.N.W. from Danmarks flue. Laxebo, carrying 2\\ fathoms, lies a short cable N. by E. from the north point of Marko. Markosundflue carries 2 fathoms, and lies three-quarters of a cable W.S.W. from the west point of S\u00e6lo. Glubodflue has 2\\ fathoms over it, and lies three-quarters of a cable S.S.W. from Glubodde, the south point of S\u00e6lo. Skudeholm lies in mid-channel between Marko and S\u00e6lhobden ; half a cable south of Skudeholm are two small rocks known as the Smaaskjers, and a shoal extending about one cable W.S.W. from the Smaaskjers termi nates in a rock over which there is only one foot of water. MARKOSUND. \u2014 If the wind is north-westerly or westerly, vessels of 18 to 20 feet draught may proceed to S\u00e6lor Havn through Markdsund. The south point of Kjingholm, in line with the north point of S\u00e6lo, leads in between Tyvebo and Danmarksflue ; when past these shoals, keep close in to S\u00e6lo to clear Laxebo and Markosundflue, and proceed for the anchorage. SOUTHERN ENTRANCE\u2014 Vessels of 16 feet draught may take the southern entrance to Selor Havn with all winds from S.E round"], [59, "Chap, ii.] S\u00c6LOR HAVN \u2014 KORSHAVN. 41 southerly to N.W. When coming from the westward, give Folo a berth of half a cable ; pass between Smaaskjer and Skudeholm, and bring up immediately inside the entrance of the harbour, so that a hawser may be laid out in time if the anchor comes home. If approaching from the southward, stand in between Grotholm and Smaaskjer ; pass westward of Tareflue, which lies one third of a cable from the point opposite Skudeholm and carries 2 fathoms, and bring up as directed above. EASTERN ENTRANCE.\u2014 Besides the above entrances, there is a passage leading from Gronsfiord to S\u00e6lor Havn, which is available for vessels of 18 to 20 feet draught with the wind from East to S.S.E. Between the Naze and this entrance are the following dangers : \u2014 Bysa, a rock with 3 feet over it, terminates a shoal which extends 1| cables N.N.W. from the Svennerne. Musaflue, carrying one fathom, lies two thirds of a cable South of Musa, and is marked by a staff and broom beacon. Lyngholmflue, with 7 feet over it, lies nearly half a cable west of Lyngholm. and is also marked by a staff and broom. Kirkegaardsfilie carries 3 fathoms, and lies one third of a cable N.N.W. of Vareholm. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Having left the Svennerne on the port hand, steer for Lypskjer and pass about half a cable eastward of it ; keep in mid channel between the marks on Musaflue and Lyngholmflue, and after rounding Musa, steer for the entrance between S\u00e6lo and S\u00e6lhobden ; give Vareholm a good berth in passing to clear Kirkegaardsflue, and proceed for Selor Havn. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels may also bring up between S\u00e6lo and Vareholm when Lypskjer comes in sight to the southward of the latter islet, in 7 fathoms shoaling to the westward ; there is good holding ground here, but shore hawsers should be kept in readiness. KORSHAVN. \u2014 Between R\u00e6vo and Kjepso there is a very good harbour, with room for about 20 vessels, but they must be moored with hawsers made fast to the rings on shore. The southern entrance, leading out of Gronsfiord, is practicable for vessels of 18 to 20 feet draught ; the northern entrance, between Kreglingholm and R\u00e6vo, can only be taken by vessels of 7 feet draught. There are several patches of foul ground be tween Flaaneflue and the north-east point of Kjepso, otherwise the holding o-round is good, and it is sometimes difficult to break the anchor out of the ground. B Flaaneflue, half a cable N.W. of Mannevikholm, the small islet south of the houses on R\u00e6vo, carries 8 feet, and is marked by a staff and"], [60, "42 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II. broom ; close in to the houses, and half a cable N.N.E. A E. of Flaaneflue, is a rock with only 3 feet over it. Rodfieldsten, about 50 yards from the east side of Kjepso, carries 3 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom. Trelflue, half a cable from the rock off the south-east point of Kjepso, is always awash. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 To make Korshavn from the southward, proceed according to the directions for the eastern entrance to S\u00e6lor Havn (page 42) until the vessel is between Musa and Lyngholmsflue ; then steer direct for Ulvaasodde, keep close to the latter point in order to clear Trelflue, and bring up westward of Flaaneflue in 12 fathoms over clay and sand. In the north part of the harbour there are 6 fathoms, and close in to Kjepso, 14 fathoms. Prom the westward. \u2014 Vessels of 18 to 20 feet draught, coming from the westward with westerly and south-westerly winds, may stand in between Tyvebo and Danmarksflue, with the south point of Kjingholm in line with the north point of S\u00e6lo. There is a shoal with 4 feet over it, three-quarters of a cable west of Kjingholm ; and a rock carrying 2 fathoms lies about a quarter of a cable from the north-west point of S\u00e6lo. Fiskeskjerflue, which carries 3 fathoms, lies three-quarters of a cable southward of Fiskeskjer. After passing close to the south side of Kjingholm, leave Fiskeskjerflue on the port hand, giving the north-east point of S\u00e6lo a fair berth at the same time ; then steer direct for Ulvaasodde, and proceed for the anchorage. Northern entrance. \u2014 The northern entrance to Korshavn, between Kjepso and Haao, is clear of offing dangers ; but shoals extend about 4 cables from the west side of Kjepso, therefore vessels must not stand to the eastward between the Thors islets. Helvedesfl ua, a rock carrying 4 feet, lies nearly in the middle of a shoal, which extends N.W. 11 cables from the north-west point of Kjepso. Sagebomflua, three-quarters of a cable W.N.W. from Kreglingholm is always awash, and is marked by an iron pillar; a shoal extends from this rock hah0 a cable to the westward. Shoals extend about three-quarters of a cable southward from the south east point of Kjerringholm, and one third of a. cable southward from the south point of Haao ; there is also a shoal off the north point of Kjepso. When entering, leave Kjerringholm and Haao on the port and Sage bomflua on the starboard hand, keeping R\u00e6vosund just open, and bring up between Kreglingholm and R\u00e6vo. Vessels drawing less than 7 feet may proceed between R\u00e6vo and the islets south of Kreglingholm, and bring up according to the foregoing directions. \u2022"], [61, "43 CHAP. II.] RODFIELDSTEN \u2014 VEST BRODSTEN. Bruneflue, a rock on which there is only one foot water, terminates a shoal extending about three-quarters of a cable N.N.E. from Bruneskjer, and is marked by an iron pole. Vessels will be westward of Bruneflue as long as the sound is open between Kjepso and R\u00e6vo. Rosvig. \u2014 There is anchorage for two small vessels in Rosvig, in 8 fathoms ; the entrance is situated southward of Sagebomflua. HUNDALSHAVN, on the north side of R\u00e6vosund, has anchor age for two or three vessels in 18 fathoms, over clay and sand. This har bour is available for vessels of 20 feet draught with' all winds from N.W. through west to South, and is generally used by vessels of war ; it is pro vided with mooring rings, and shore hawsers should always be ready for running out to them. To enter Hundalshavn, proceed according to the directions for the northern entrance to Korshavn ; haul to the northward after passing Sagebomflua and Bruneflue, in order to clear a shoal which extends a short distance from Nogleodde, and briug up as most convenient. HaUSVig, on the east side of the entrance to Rosfiord, has room for two or three vessels to ride at single anchor in 8 fathoms, and may be entered with the wind from S.W. through south to S.E. Bjorneskjerflue, a rock carrying 3 feet, lies one cable N.W. from Langholm, and three quarters of a cable S.W. from Bjorne rocks. Hausvig House just visible northward of the point on the east side of the entrance to the harbour, leads in from seaward between Bjorneskjerflue and Sudno, and is a scraping mark for the shoal off the south point of Grotholm, therefore vessels should edge to the southward when nearing the latter islet, and keep in mid-channel when entering the harbour. Northerly winds are required for leaving Hausvig. OUTLYING DANGERS between the NAZE and LISTER. \u2014 A vessel having approached the coast between the Naze and Lister, and being unable to obtain a pilot, may stand in for either Rosfiord, Ullero, or F\u00e6ro. The only outlying dangers on this stretch are the following : \u2014 YSTESTENEN.\u2014 The Ystestens, a cluster of rocks above and below water, lie about half way between the Naze and Listerland ; this cluster being isolated, and outside all the other dangers, will be easily recog nised. ROHOLM Or RODHOLM, so named from its reddish colour, is the principal of a group of four islets lying half way between Ystestenen and F\u00e6ro, and is also easily distinguished. VEST or WEST BRODSTENEN, with 2 feet of water over it, lies 3\u00a7 cables S.S.W. from Roholm, and is always indicated by breakers."], [62, "44 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II. OSTRE Or EAST ROHOLMPLUA, carries 4 fathoms, and lies 4| cables south-eastward of the Roholm group. VEST Or WEST ROHOLMPLUA, has 5 fathoms over it, and lies 4 cables S.W. from Roholm. ROSFIORD extends about 5 miles in a north-easterly direction from Hausvig and Tranevaag, and would afford good shelter from southerly or westerly gales. The fiord is deep and clean, nothing being dangerous ex cept what is visible or close in to the shore. The approach is easy and free from outlying dangers. Should a vessel be within, and southward of the Ystesten rocks, she may stand in between Herreholm, which is rather lofty and of a reddish colour, and the Rosfiordskjers, a cluster of small naked rocks off the west side of the entrance to Rosfiord. Kvalsvig, a bight on the west side of the fiord, 3 miles in from the entrance, is the best anchorage in Rosfiord ; the entrance is clean and roomy, and the depth is 12 fathoms shoaling to 8. There is also anchorage for small vessels, in Skarstenbugt, Svennevigbugt, Agnefest, Skumrag, Austadstrand, Bordvig, and B\u00e6robugt (between B\u00e6ro and Bordvigland). Ullero Havn, between Vikelen and Ullero, has anchorage for two or three vessels, steadied by shore hawsers, in 12 to 14 fathoms over clay and sand. There is a rock in the north part of the harbour, from which a shoal extends about one cable to the southward ; and east of this rock, about 50 yards from Ullero, is a small sunken rock. To enter Ullero Havn from the southward, pass westward of Kubbestenen at a distance of about 2 cables, and when Vikelsund, between Vikelen and Ullero, is well open, or the whole of Marko is visible eastward of Kubbestenen, steer straight up the sound, passing westward of East Brodstenen and Langbo, and eastward of Bredflue, Vrageflue, and Klanholmflue ; give the west side of Ullero a fair berth in order to clear the Kalve shoals, which lie about 70 yards from the shore, and bring up in the bight north-westward of the houses on Ullero. This entrance is available with all winds from S.W., through south to East ; with north-westerly winds the northern entrance may be taken. If coming from the westward, keep Roholm open southward of the beacon on Lindholm in order to clear West Roholmflua ; leave Roholm on the port hand, and steer for Humerskjer, taking care to keep the south point of Skarvo visible southward of Lersholm, in order to clear the shoals off Gaasholm ; pass northward of Klanskjer, and when the houses on Ullero are visible northward of Vikelen, proceed for the anchorage, leaving the rock in Vikelsund on the starboard hand."], [63, "CHAP. II.] ROSFIORD \u2014 ULLERO SUND. 45 ULLEROSUND and SKARVO HAVN.-Ulleriisund, between Ullero and Tero, is a good roadstead, where vessels of war or other large vessels which may be obliged to stand in for shelter can anchor in 16 to 18 fathoms, over clay and sand. There is smooth water in Ullerosund, but the wind is much felt there. Supplies cannot be obtained nearer than Farsund. Skarvo Havn, on the south side of Skarvo, is a smoother anchorage than Ullerosund, and is therefore considered preferable. On the west side of the harbour is a hill resembling a sugar-loaf, by which the island Skarvo may be recognised. There is an inner harbour named Viken, with room for about 15 vessels of 8 feet draught, but the entrance is narrow, and there is a shoal off the point on the west side. To clear this shoal, keep Sandholm, the outermost islet in Skarvo Havn, in line with the point on the east side of the entrance to Viken. Large vessels may anchor off the outer entrance to Skarvo Havn in 20 fathoms, with F\u00e6ro tower in line with the north point of Hestholm ; but they generally stand farther in, keeping in mid-channel between Sandholm and the point on the east side of the entrance to Viken, and bring up in 6^ fathoms, with Lersholm in line with the point westward of Sandholm, mooring with a stern hawser. There is only one mooring ring here, but the rocks are convenient for securing hawsers to. Vessels of moderate size may anchor in the bight north-west of Sand holm. There is good holding ground, consisting of clay and sand, in all these anchorages, but with north-westerly winds, vessels must always be steadied by shore hawsers. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The eastern entrance to Ullerosund and Skarvo Havn is free from dangers. Vessels approaching from the southward should steer for the south-east point of Ullero, and pass between the Kubbestenen and Midtfiordskjer, which lies nearly half a mile W.N.W. from Herreholm. When passing through Ullerosund, it must be remem bered that Tero must not be approached nearer than three-quarters of a cable, as there is shoal water along the south-west shore. If considered advisable to proceed to Skarvo Havn, keep Ullerosund open until the stone on Stensholm is open westward of the north-west point of Ullero ; the latter mark will lead clear of Teroflue, a rock carrying 3 feet, which lies about 50 yards from the north shore of Tero. Vessels may pass on either side of Skarvoflue, which has 2 fathoms over it, and lies 1\\ cables north of Tero, and when the warehouse in Skarvo bight is in line with the rock inside Sandholm, they may steer for the entrance, and anchor according to circumstances. With all winds from"], [64, "46 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. ii. E.N.E. through east and south to S.W., the eastern entrance is the best. Fleskehella, a rock on the north extreme of a shoal extending 1 *- cables N.N.W. from the north point of Ullero, is always awash, and has an iron pillar on it. From the Westward. \u2014 To make Ullerosund or Skarvo Havn from the westward, proceed according to the directions given for the western entrance to Ullero Havn (page 45), until past the shoals off Gaasholm ; keep close to the north side of Humerskjer in order to clear a shoal extending three-quarters of a cable from the south point of Lersholm, and bring the west side of Humerskjer just inside the east point of Asalholm. The latter mark will lead between Lersholmflua and Fleskehella. When past Fleskehella proceed for the most convenient anchorage, keeping nearest to Skarvo in order to avoid Skarvoflue. Hestholmfl.ua, carrying 3 feet, is a broad shoal extending 1| cables westward from Hestholm, and is marked by a staff and broom. When turning to windward, in the vicinity of Hestholmflua, the helm must be put down directly the south point of Lango begins to hide the houses in Lodshavn, the harbour north of F\u00e6ro and Sando. There is a narrow passage between Hestholm and Skarvo. Vessels coming from the westward may also stand in between F\u00e6roflua and the Roholm group, passing northward of Lindholm. The north Roholm shoal, carrying 7i- fathoms, lies about 2\\ cables north of the northernmost islet of the Roholm group, and Lindholmbo, which carries 2 fathoms, is situated about 2 cables north of Lindholm. SPINDFIORD takes a north-easterly direction from the north side of Skarvo, and has several anchorages for small vessels. The passage in from the westward lies between Lindholm and Bremerodden, the south point of Lango, westward of the three tongues running out from the west side of Skarvo, and between Tyveholm and Ausn\u00e6s holm. An extensive shoal, with 2 to 3 feet over it, runs out from the land on the east side of the entrance to Spindfiord ; to clear this shoal keep Gr\u00e6sholm well open westward of Fladholm until Bjornevaag is open, and the houses at the head of the bay are well in sight. To pass between the shoals off Vrangholm and Bugdo, keep the middle of Haaoskjer, the rock nearest Gr\u00e6sholm, in line with the east point of Little Tero. The point west of Vrangholm in line with Dotholm leads eastward of Ersagerflua. The eastern entrance to Spindfiord is between Ullero and Rosfiordskjer, eastward of Little Tero and Skarvo and between Gr\u00e6sholm and Kraaga. Small vessels may pass between Humerholm and Haabholm to Lyngs vaag, or if coming from from the westward, they may stand in between Fladholm and Kjeholm. All these passages are clearly laid down on"], [65, "CHAP. II.] SPINDFIORD \u2014 FARSUND. 47 the chart, and as they are net likely to be used, except by those possessing local knowledge, it would be useless to give a minute description of them. FARSUND. \u2014 The town of Farsund is built on the side of a steep hill at the west side of the entrance to Lyngdals Fiord ; it has 1,500 inhabi tants, but is of little commercial importance. Supplies and water may be obtained at Farsund, and an English vice consul is resident. The harbour has a depth of 4 to 8 fathoms over sandy bottom, and is fairly sheltered, but strong southerly gales send in rather a heavy swell ; there are mooring rings on Faro, EngS, and Gausholm, three small islands east of the town, and 12 dolphins on the opposite side of the harbour. Large vessels generally anchor outside Gulesten, a rock southward of Gausholm. A bar, with only 13 to 14 feet over it, extends from the north point of Faro to the mill on the point opposite. Vessels may stand in on either side of F\u00e6ro, but East F\u00e6rosund is more spacious and convenient than the passage between F\u00e6ro and Sando. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed light, elevated 51 feet, and visible 10 miles in clear weather, is shown from the low tower of a white building on the south-west point of South Katland. From seaward, the light shows white between the bearings N.E. and North (the bearing N.E. leads east ward of F\u00e6roflue and the shoals off F\u00e6rokalven) ; red between North and N.N.W. \\ W. (over the positions of West Brodsten and East Roholmflue) ; and white from N.N.W. \\ W. to West. Towards and northward of Pr\u00e6stosund the light shows white between the bearings S.E. by E. \\ E. and S. \\ W. In the direction of F\u00e6rokalven, a sector of ivhite light is shown through an arc of 5\u00b0, between the bearings East and E. \\ N., the northern limit of this sector leads south of Svaneflue and Skvetsk jersten; the southern limit northward of R\u00e6voflue and R\u00e6vbskjer ; R\u00e6vokraaka, which is free from danger on the south and west sides, lies nearly in the centre of this sector, which also shows over the south end of R\u00e6vo. On the north end of F\u00e6rokalven a reflector is placed, which reflects a sector of light through an arc of about 12\u00b0 on a W.N.W. bearing, or northward of the shoals off F\u00e6rokalven, and southward of Hellerne. BEACONS. \u2014 In addition to F\u00e6ro tower there is a stone beacon, painted black with a white belt, on R\u00e6vo, the southernmost island off the west entrance to Farsund. PILOTS are always on the look out at F\u00e6ro tower, and when it is impossible for them to come out they hoist a white flag at the staff to signify that they will board the vessel as soon as she gets into sufficiently smooth water."], [66, "48 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels coming from the southward, after passing the Naze and Bispen rock, should shape course for Midtfiordskjer, which may be left on either hand, and then steer so as to pass at least 1^ cables northward of the Roholm group. Midtfiordskjer kept as far outside F616, as the south point of the latter is distant from the old lighthouse on Marko, leads northward of the Roholm shoals and between South Katland and East F\u00e6ro Kalven ; when in mid-channel between the latter islands steer rather to the northward of Ekvaagstenen, or the summit of the hill above Ekvaag, until R\u00e6vo is open westward of F\u00e6ro, when the vessel will be westward of the Katland shoals, and course may be altered for the east side of Ekero. Vessels may generally pass about half a cable from the south and west sides of South Katland, but if the sea is heavy it is better to give the south side a berth of a good cable in order to avoid Ydre or Outer Hellern, on which there are 6 to 8 fathoms. Skotteflua, one cable from the rock off the south-east shgre of Ekero, is always awash, and has an iron pole on it. After passing Skotteflua the course to Farsund harbour lies between Pr\u00e6sto and Tyveholm, and west of Lamholm, Skydskjer, and Fesholm. Vessels may also pass between Skydskjer and Fesholm, and enter the harbour between Faro and Engo, giving the north point of the latter a fair berth. A shoal between Faro and Engo is marked by a black pole. There are only 4 fathoms in mid-channel between Pr\u00e6sto and Tyve holm, but the depth is greater on either side. Lamholmflua, west of Lamholm, is marked by a staff and broom. A shoal extends about half a cable north of Skydskjer. Engosten, off the north point of Engo, has a staff and broom on it. At night. \u2014 Entering Farsund at night, vessels should keep South Katland light between the bearings of North and N.N.E., until within one or 2 cables of the islet. If the reflected light from F\u00e6rokalv is not visible owing to thick weather, vessels will be clear of Hellerne as long as the light on South Katland does not become faint. After rounding the south-west side of South Katland, at a distance of one cable, steer N.W. through the arc in which the light is obscured, and when it is again visible either anchor in F\u00e6ro road or proceed for Farsund or Ekvaa\u00b0-. Entrance east Of Katland.\u2014 To proceed eastward of the shoals off Katland, steer for Svartskjer after passing the Roholm group ; pass about one cable westward of Svartskjer and Bratholm, and the same distance eastward of Fudeskjer and Risholm ; leave the staff and broom beacon on Haaofiua on the starboard hand, and keep close in to the south-west shore of Store, or Great Haao, to clear the shoals off Little Haao ; then steer rather more to the westward in order to clear a rock with 3 fathoms over it, which lies half a cable N.W. of Store Haao, and is marked by a staff"], [67, "caxp. ii.] DIRECTIONS FOR FARSUND. 49 -and broom, and proceed for the anchorage, passing eastward of Skydskjer and Fesholm. There is a passage between Fesholm and Engo to the outer anchorage off Gulesten. A shoal, carrying 6 feet, lies a good half cable south of Engo, and a rock, with only one foot over it, lies about one-third of a cable N.W. of Fesholm ; both these dangers are marked by pole beacons. Vessels approaching from the southward may also leave the Ystesten rocks on the starboard hand, and stand in between West Roholmflua and West Brodstenen, by keeping Ekvaagsteuen in line with F\u00e6ro tower. From the SOUth-westward.\u2014 Vessels approaching from the southward and westward may stand boldly in for F\u00e6ro tower, as there are no dangers to be apprehended on this line of approach until within a mile of F\u00e6ro. F\u00e6roflua, a rock with 3 fathoms over it, lies about 7 cables S.S.W. from F\u00e6ro ; a shoal extends from this rock one cable to the south-eastward. To pass eastward of F\u00e6roflua, keep the houses at Nautland open eastward of East Kalven ; Homskniben, the highest peak of the mountain between Lyngdals fiord and Drange fiord, open westward of East Kalven, leads clear to the westward. R\u00e6vOSkjer, a round rock lying 3 cables S.E. by E. from the south point of R\u00e6vo, has an iron pillar on it. A shoal extends nearly 2 cables from R\u00e6voskjer to the north-east, and Rajvoflua, a shoal with 10 feet over it, lies If cables to the south-westward. Saltrud cairn, just open eastward of Kraaga, or Ekvaagstenen in line with the east point of Kraaga, will lead westward of these shoals ; and Haao beacon, or the east point of Pr\u00e6sto, in line with the east point of Sando, leads clear to the east ward. Mellemflua, carrying 4^ fathoms, lies 11 cables south of Fladskjer. There are numerous rocks round the islets south of F\u00e6ro, but as the sea breaks on most of them they are easily avoided. East F\u00e6roStmd. \u2014 Homskniben kept between South and Middle Katland will lead clear of F\u00e6roflue and the shoals off East Kalven, and when Ekvaagstenen is in line with the north point of F\u00e6ro, the vessel may proceed through Eust F\u00e6rosund according to the foregoing directions. West F\u00e6rOSUnd. \u2014 Haao beacon, or the east point of Pr\u00e6sto, in line with the east point of Sando, will lead in clear of the shoals off R\u00e6voskjer and West Kalven, aud when R\u00e6vo beacon is seen between the outer Saltrudskjer and Saltrud, course may be altered so as to pass a good half cable north of F\u00e6ro into the channel already described. From the Westward. \u2014 Vessels may close F\u00e6ro from the west ward keeping the south points of Lango and Kraaga in line, and when past the latter islet they may steer direct for F\u00e6ro tower until Haao K \"40.

ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Some of the harbours in the approaches to Farsund would afford anchorage to vessels of any draught, and inside F\u00e6ro there is a good roadstead for vessels of war. HUMERDUS.\u2014 Vessels of 16 feet draught may stand in and anchor north of Humerdusholm and east of the inner Flyndreskjer, in 4\u00a3 fathoms over sand, provided the wind is not northward of E.S.E. The south-east point of Humerdusholm, inside or eastward of Tyveholmen, leads in between Humersdusfiua and Syvhausflua. When past Fred riksflua, stand in between Einarsn\u00e6s and Humerdusholm, giving the south point of the latter a good berth, and bring up when the inner Flyndreskjer is inline with Kniben. Humerdusflua and Fredriksflua are always awash, and Syvhausflua has 3 feet over it, and lies three-quarters of a cable N.W. from Tofilholm, the outermost of the two small islets west of R\u00e6vo. West Of Humerdus. \u2014 The outer Flyndreskjer in line with Bondefield, (which may be recognised by its steep fall to the westward,) leads between Humerdusflua and Robbefl.ua, which is always awash. Leave Flyndreskjer on the port hand, giving it a good berth, keep close in to the north point of Humerdusholm and bring up as before directed. Sildevig, east of Sildevigholm, N.W. of Humerdus, is only a temporary anchorage for small craft. Sverres-haug, or hillock, in line with the east point of Great Svartskjer, will lead in clear of Svaneflua and Skaarskjerflua, and Sverres-haug in line with the east point of Great Skaarskjer, leads between the latter islet and Little Skaarskjer. A shoal extends about half a cable from Sildevigholm to the southward and westward. LODSHAVN, is a good harbour between Sando and the mainland, with room for about 20 vessels steadied by hawsers to the rings on shore, in 10 fathoms shoaling to 5, over clay. Vessels of 12 feet draught may take the eastern entrance with the wind from E.N.E., through south to S.W., and the western entrance is available for vessels of 18 feet draught, with all winds from N.W. through south to S.S.E. Western entrance. \u2014 Vessels coming from the westward with north-westerly winds, may close R\u00e6vo keeping Kraaga in line with Skarvo hill, or the south points of Lango and Kraaga in line, until the custom's watch-house in Lodshavn is in line with R\u00e6vosundsskjer, which will lead in between Syvhausflua and the Tofil islets. When near R\u00e6vo sundsskjer haul to the eastward until the inner Saltrudskjer is in line with the Look-out House, which will lead clear of Paulsflue and Sauflua. Leave"], [69, "CHAP. II.] HUMERDUS \u2014 F\u00c6RO ORLOGSRED. 51 the inner Saltrudskjer on the starboard hand, and steer about halfway between Ekvaagstenen and the beacon on Ekero, and when Rodlandsknib, a sugar-lbaf hill near Spind church, is visible through Smalsund, the vessel will be clear of the shoal off the north-west point of Sando, and may enter the harbour and bring up anywhere between the last-mentioned point and Buodde, the point opposite the Look-out House. There is a shoal off Buodde, which is marked by a staff and broom. Paulsflua is always awash, and a shoal extends from this rock to the inner Saltrudskjer. Sauflua has a staff and broom on it. Vessels may also stand in for Lodshavn between R\u00e6voskjer and R\u00e6vo. Saltrud beacon, seen just eastward of Kraaga, will clear the shoals off R\u00e6vo skjer, and when passed Little R\u00e6vo, keep the east point of that islet just westward of Kraaga in order to clear Odflua, a shoal carrying 2 fathoms, which extends three-quarters of a cable N.E. from Little R\u00e6vo. When R\u00e6vbsundsskjer is in line with the south point of Humerdusholm, stand in between Paulsflua and Sauflua, and proceed according to the previous directions. With south-easterly winds, vessels may stand in with Haao beacon, or the east point of Pr\u00e6sto, in line with the east point of Sando. The vessel will be northward ofthe shoal off R\u00e6voskjer when Little R\u00e6vo is open southward of the islets off Einarsn\u00e6s, and may then keep away for Sauflua, giving the outer Saltrudskjer a berth of at least one cable, and passing half a cable westward of Paulsflua. When the inner Saltrudskjer is in line with the point on the west side of the entrance to Nyhavn, (a small bight west of the custom-house,) the vessel will be close to the shoal between Sauflua and R\u00e6vosundsskjer, aud must haul up for the entrance of the harbour. Eastern entrance. \u2014 Proceed according to the directions for Farsund and East F\u00e6rbsund (pages 48, 49) until well to the northward of F\u00e6ro, and bring Little Sandoskjer in line with the cairn on Sonderhals. Keep the latter mark on until past the shoal off Rundholm, which is marked by a staff and broom ; then haul to the northward, and proceed for the anchorage, keeping in mid-channel through the sound. This entrance is very narrow, and cannot be taken by vessels drawing more than 12 feet. F\u00c6RO ORLOGSRED, or MAN-OP-WAR ROAD, between F\u00e6ro, Sando, Ekero, and the Katland islands, is a good anchorage for vessels of war, as it is not only capacious and easy of access, but may be left with nearly all winds ; the depth is about 18 fathoms, and the bottom, consisting of stiff clay, affords very good holding ground. On account of the depth of water in this road it is seldom used by merchant vessels, except as a temporary anchorage when detained by calms or contrary winds. To make F\u00e6ro Orlogsred, follow the directions given for Farsund and East F\u00e6round (pages 48, 49). d 2"], [70, "52 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap, ii EKVAAG is an excellent harbour situated between Ekero and the mainland, with room for about 50 vessels ; it has 22 mooring rings, and a depth of 11 to 5 fathoms over stiff clay ; there is also a place where vessels of moderate size may be hove down. Vessels of 18 feet draught may enter the harbour from the southward with all winds from W.S.W. through south to E.N.E., and leave it with the winds from W.S.W. through north to N.E. Bjornesund, the entrance north of Ekero, is only available for vessels of 8 feet draught ; there is a rock with 4 feet over it, close to Ekero on the east side of this entrance ; and a rock with one foot over it in the middle of Sletterig the north-east corner of Ekvaag. Large vessels will also find good anchorage outside Bjornesund, between Bukholm and Tyveholm. A rock, with one fathom over it, lies about a quarter of a cable eastward of the north point of Tyveholm. The passage to Ekvaag from the man of-war road lies between the mainland and the islets off Ekero. The Roholm islets must be kept in sight when entering the harbour in order to clear Ekvaagflue, a rock off the south end of the houses, which has one fathom over it and is marked by a staff and broom. Skottehavn, between Pr\u00e6sto and UrS, may be entered from the northward by vessels of 14 feet draught with the wind from E.N.E. to S.E.> and from the southward by vessels of 20 feet draught, with the wind from N.W., through west and south to S.S.E. ; this harbour has seven mooring rings, a depth of 11 fathoms over stiff clay, and room for about 10 vessels. For this southern entrance, the directions for Farsund (page 48) may be followed until past Skotteflun, when the passage lies in mid-channel between the islands forming the harbour. The northern entrance between the north point of Uro, and the nearest rock to the westward, may be taken after passing Haaoflua according to the directions given for the entrance to Farsund, east of Katland. Havig, Bekkevig, Nautland, and Birken\u00e6s, are small harbours on the coast of Spindland for vessels of 8 to 10 feet draught. The entrance to Havig is clear, with the exception of a rock off the point on the east side. There are two rocks in Bekkevig, and the entrance is between these and Brunsvigodden. Nautland bight is perfectly clear, and Birken\u00e6s bight is clear to the eastward, but a shoal extends from the west side to a distance of half a cable from the shore. Lundevaag, immediately south of Farsund, has anchorage inside Smalsund in 16 fathoms, over good holding ground. When passing through Smalsund, keep close to the land on the south side ; the head of the bay is shoal to a distance of about 2 cables from the shore. FIORDS. \u2014 From Farsund the following fiords extend inland : \u2014"], [71, "chap, h.] EKVAAG \u2014 LISTERLAND. 53 Kjorefiord and Hel Vig Fiord. \u2014 Kjorefiord takes a westerly direction from Farsund ; after passing Kjorefiord holm, anchorage may be found in the first bight on the south side of the fiord ; a shoal with 2\\ fathoms over it lies 1^ cables E.S.E. from Kjorefiord holm. In Oivold sund, between Kjorefiord and Helvig fiord, there is only 2 fathoms water ; Helvig fiord has a depth of 10 to 20 fathoms, over sand and clay. Bjornvig. \u2014 There is good anchorage in Bjornvig, about half a mile north of Farsund; Kjilsholmflua has one fathom over it, and lies about half a cable north of Kjilsholm. Lyngdalsfiord has two anchorages, and two good salmon rivers, the Herdalselv and Lyngdalselv fall into it. The Aspero shoals extend from the shores on both sides of the fiord, at Aspero, and there is a narrow channel between them with 5 fathoms in it. To pass through this channel, keep Haaveland house over the east end of the houses at S\u00e6veland. In Dybvig bight there are 15 fathoms shoaling to 10, over sand and clay ; the best anchorage is on the west side ; a shoal with 2 feet over it lies about 1^ cables inside the point on the west side of the entrance, about three quarters of a cable from the shore. Aunevig bight is a very good harbour available for large vessels ; the depth is 7 fathoms. Ofte-fiord and Drange-fiord. \u2014 Ofte-fiord is perfectly clear, with the exception of a broad shoal with 2 fathoms over it (Storegrunden), which lies about 3 cables east of Sande. S\u00e6lflua, with 7 feet over it, lies one cable from the shore, opposite Havaas in Drange-fiord ; Kalvn\u00e6sflua, on which there is only one foot, lies in mid-ehannel between Kalvn\u00e6s and the point opposite, and there is 2 fathoms water on each side ; vessels may anchor anywhere along the shore on the west side of the fiord, between Kalvn\u00e6s and Strand. Several small rivers fall into these fiords from lakes about a mile inland ; some of these lakes are of considerable extent, and excellent sport may be obtained in the neighbouring country. LISTERLAND Or LISTER is a level plain projecting about 2 miles from the foot of the high land between Farsund and Lister fiord ; it terminates in a low sandy shore bordered by ranges of sand hills, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 12 to 16 miles. Throughout the whole coast of Norway there are but two such tracts of low land, namely, Listerland and J\u00e6deren, situated 53 miles farther north ; there fore whenever a low tract of coast is observed it must be one or the other, and they are easily distinguished. J\u00e6deren has an extent of about 30 miles of coast, Lister only 7 miles. Off the north end of J\u00e6deren there is a cluster of small islands, but none off Lister. The south end of J\u00e6deren is bordered by lofty and deep land trending in a southerly direction, but from"], [72, "54 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II the south end of Lister the land trends nearly E.S.E., and does not at first appear very high, but only hilly. COAST. \u2014 About 8 miles eastward of Lister the land to the southward appears to form an extensive bay studded with islands, some of which are high, and others quite low ; of these islands, Skarvo and F\u00e6ro are parti cularly remarkable, the former having at one end a hill resembling a sugar-loaf, and the latter a white tower on the summit. In clear weather the Naze lighthouse will also be visible ; and about 5 miles eastward of Gunnarshaug vjoint is a cleft between two hill sides known as Listerskaret. Between Hummerdus and Havigholm there is a considerable extent of sand, which, being of a reddish colour in places, has sometimes been mis taken for Mandal's sand, to which it certainly bears some slight resem blance ; the difference in situation is, however, too great to render such a mistake possible except in very thick weather. Northward of Lister the coast forms a deep bay or gulf, from which a narrow fiord, with high land on both sides, stretches inland to the north-eastward. SOUNDINGS Off LISTER.\u2014 Off the west coast of Lister, at a distance of 3 or 4 cables from the shore, there is an average depth of 8 fathoms. The bottom consists of sand, interspersed with large round stones. The depths increase rapidly to the westward, and at a distance of half a mile to a mile from the shore there are 50 to 60 fathoms ; from thence the ground declines abruptly, and there is no bottom at 85 fathoms. Off the west extreme of Lister the depths are less, and on a N.W. line of soundings from Gunnarshaug lighthouse, there are only 14 fathoms at a distance of three-quarters of a mile from the point ; from thence the depth increases steadily, and at 1^ miles farther out there are 50 fathoms. LISTERSTENS-\u2014 The Listerstens are a cluster of rocks off the west extreme of Listerland. The outermost of these rocks is known as Sieflua; it has one fathom over it, and lies 2\\ cables from the west extreme of Listerland; a rock carrying 1^ fathoms lies 2 cables southward of Sieflua, and between the two, at 4\u00b1 cables from the shore, is a 3-fathom patch. With these exceptions the Listerstens are uncovered, and the sea breaks violently on them in rough weather. LIGHT. \u2014 The white stone tower on Gunnarshaug, at the west ex treme of Listerland, is a conspicuous object from the offing ; it is 110 feet high, and exhibits, at an elevation of 129 feet, a flashing light show ing a flash every four seconds, which should be visible 18 miles in clear weather. During thick and foggy weather a fog horn will be sounded from Lister lighthouse, giving two consecutive blasts of six seconds' duration every minute. Beacons. \u2014 There is a pole beacon on Stanghaug, or Pole hillock, a green mound about one mile S.E. from the lighthouse ; and farther to the"], [73, "CHAP. II.] 55 LISTER \u2014 FLEKKEFIORD . southward there are several other grass covered mounds, which may be seen from a distance of 4 or 5 miles if the weather is tolerably clear. PILOTS. \u2014 In rough weather, with the wind blowing dead on shore, it is hardly possible for pilots to come out from Lister, owing to the heavy ground swell, but with slant winds, and anything like a moderate sea, they will come off from Gunnarshaug point. When the wind permits a vessel to stand off and on, she may approach the point to within about three quarters of a mile, in order to obtain a pilot. CAUTION. \u2014 In approaching this part of the coast, the greatest danger to be apprehended is from the current, which, to the southward of the Listerstens, sometimes sets right on the coast, and even round from the northward, especially when its general direction is to the westward. To the northward of the Listerstens this current is counteracted by the stream issuing from Lister Fiord. ANCHORAGE.\u2014 Abreast of Stanghaug beacon lies an islet named Brekneholm, between which and Kibrve, on the mainland, is a small harbour available for vessels of 13 to 14 feet draught with all winds from N.W. through south to East ; there are two small warping posts here, and the depth is 3 fathoms, over a sandy bottom. Brekneholm is flat, and consists entirely of pebbles, over which there is but little grass ; it cannot therefore be made out until the vessel is very near the land. To enter the harbour, keep the pole on Stanghaug in the middle of Tvetfield, bearing about N.E. by E. \\ E. ; this will lead in clear of a shoal which extends from Brekneholm 11 cables to the south-west, and one cable to the southward. Vigmundsflua, a sunk en rock on the south side of the entrance, is marked by a dolphin ; a shoal extends from this rock about 2 cables to the south westward. The anchor should be let go as soon as Brekneholm is passed, and the water becomes somewhat smoother. Pilot boats will probably be found lying here with hawsers in readiness. This harbour should only be used in summer, when it might afford refuge to a vessel drifting in a calm, with the current setting on the coast. LIGHT. \u2014 Varn\u00e6s, a conspicuous headland 4^ miles north-eastward of Gunnarshaug, is the extreme point of the high land on the south side of Lister Fiord. The lighthouse is a small wooden building, which exhibits, at 89 feet above high water, a fixed light, visible 9 miles in clear weather between the bearings of N.E. | E., through east and south to W. S. FLEKKEFIORD.* \u2014 The thriving town of Flekkefiord, population 1,700, skirts the northern shore of the bay at the inner end of Flekkefiord, about 8 miles from Varn\u00e6s. The narrow passage between Flekkefiord * See plan : \u2014 Flekkefiord anchorages \"on Admiralty chart, No. 883, scale m = 1*5 inches (in course of preparation)."], [74, "56 [chap. II- THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. and Grisefiord divides the town into two parts, which are connected by a drawbridge. Flekkefiord is well known for its extensive tanneries, and the extreme beauty of its scenery attracts many visitors. An English vice-consul iu resident. The harbour in front of the town is roomy and free from dangers ; it has a depth of 27 to 13 fathoms over good holding ground, consisting of stiff clay but the entrance is very narrow. Alongside the coaling wharf the depth is 14 feet. There is every convenience here for repairing and heaving down vessels, and supplies of all kinds are plentiful throughout the year. The tidal stream almost always runs out. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If coming from the southward and westward, give Gunnarshaug point a berth of about 2 miles, and steer for Varn\u00e6s ; after passing the latter point, keep to the southward and eastward of the Mosseskjer, two rocky ledges just above water on the south-east side of Andabelo, and proceed to the northward through Stolsfiord. Leave the Bjorn islauds on the port hand, and pass between Kjeo and Lasholm, keeping nearest the former. From thence the course lies eastward of Fieldsaa islets, and through a narrow passage between the staff and broom beacons on the shoals off Gronn\u00e6s and Svegeodholm to Flekkefiord harbour. Passage West Of Andabelo. \u2014 The Stolsfiord entrance to Flekke fiord is the clearest, but as the wind is nearly always baffling and squally to the eastward of Andabelo, it is generally considered advisable, after leaving Varn\u00e6s, to proceed to the northward through Stromsfiord, west of Andabelo. From Stromsfiord the course lies northward of Engelsholm and south ward of Risholm. The Customs Look-out House, which is painted white with a red roof, stands on the west spit of Engelsholm, and the eastern edge of the shoal surrounding Risholm is marked by a staff and broom. When rounding Engelsholm, give it a berth of nearly one cable and keep within half a cable of Andabelo when passing Risholm ; give Rodholm a berth of one cable, and keep about the same distance from the mainland south of Bjorno in order to clear Tommervigflua. After passing between Bjorno and the mainland, leave the staff and broom on Stavnedalsflua on the starboard hand, pass westward of Kjeo and Lasholm, and proceed for Flekkefiord according to the foregoing directions. HITERO-SUND.*\u2014 If to the westward of Hitero, with the wind on shore, and the weather such that pilots cannot venture out, a vessel may st and into Hitero-Sund, keeping in mid-channel, and when in suffi ciently smooth water a pilot will be sure to come on board. Buckstad point, on the south side of Hitero-Sund at the east end, visible north ward of Kvalsbierg, with lead in northward of Store Kaadoflua, which * See plan : \u2014 Rasvaag and Kirkehavn anchorages on Admiralty chart, No. 883, scale m = l-5 inches (in course of preparation)."], [75, "57 CHAP. II.] FLEKKEFIORD \u2014 FEDDEFIORD. carries 5 fathoms, and lies 2 cables N.E. N. from the north-west point of Kaado. A shoal extends half a cable to the westward from a rock situated close to Lie, half a mile inside the entrance on the north side of the sound, and Kvellandsbo, which carries 2^ fathoms, lies about 2 cables south of the houses at Kvellandstrand, in the bight west of Abelsn\u00e6s. With these exceptions Hitero-Sund is free from dangers, and when turning through vessels may stand close in to the land on either side. When past Bukstad steer for Andabel Varn\u00e6s, and after giving that point a fair berth proceed as before directed for Flekkefiord. In Hitero Sund, there are no harbours, and only two stopping places for small vessels. The first of these, a cove west of Vialsknuden, has a depth of 3 fathoms ; Springfl.ua, a rock on the east side of the entrance, is always awash, and a shoal extends from Kjeholm about one cable to the eastward The other anchorage is a small creek at Eie, on the south side of the sound ; a shoal extends nearly half way across the entrance from the point on the west side ; the depth is 10 to 12 fathoms over sand. Eie is only separated from Rasvaag by the low narrow neck of land which connects the two parts into which Hitero is divided. Off Bukstad, about a mile to the eastward of Eie, there is an open roadstead with 14 to 16 fathoms, over a sandy bottom. HARBOURS.\u2014 The harbours in the approaches to Flekkefiord derive importance both from their position so near the Naze and the facility with which they may be entered. When near the south-west coast of Norway, in unsettled or rough weather, seamen should pay particular attention to the directions for and Listerfiord (page 56), so that they may be able to seek shelter in case of emergency. FEDDEFIORD is a deep gorge diverging to the north-eastward from Listerfiord, and when running through' the latter it will be directly ahead. A vessel having entered Listerfiord in a hard gale or thick weather, or with so much northing in the wind that she cannot fetch through either Stols or Stroms fiords, may safely run into Feddefiord without a pilot. In Lervig, at the inner end of the fiord, there are about 20 fathoms, over a sandy bottom ; the best anchorage, however, is abreast of Fedde church, in 25 fathoms, shoaling to 13 and 6 fathoms towards the houses. Feddefiord is quite clear, with the exception of Skageflua, a shoal with 2\\ fathoms over it, lying 1\\ cables west of Skage point, but as the wind nearly always blows straight up or down the fiord, there may be some difficulty in getting out. The village of Fedde carries on a brisk traffic in tan, and plank from the saw mills on the Gylauds river, which falls into Feddefiord. Water can always be obtained at Fedde, and, generally, supplies also. The Kvina river also falls into this fiord. Indre and Ydre Kalven, or the Inner and Outer Calf, are two long, narrow coves, which nearly separate Klubben, the south-east point of"], [76, "58 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. II. Hitero, from the main island. Ydre Kalven, the westermost of these inlets, has a depth of 4 fathoms, but the entrance is very narrow, and there is a shoal off the point on the east side. Indre Kalven has a depth of 6 fathoms just inside the entrance, shoaling to 3 fathoms and 6 feet farther in, and is quite clear. These anchorages are only available for small vessels. Langelandsstrand, immediately to the northward of some small islets lying off the east side of Hitero, where the lands slopes gradually to the sea, is a good stopping place for small vessels, with a depth of 6 fathoms, over sand. The southern entrance is clear, and may be taken by vessels of 8 feet draught ; the northern entrance is available for vessels of 12 feet draught, but a shoal extends nearly half a cable to the northward and eastward of the northernmost islet. ENGELSHOLM and ABELSN\u00c6S\u2014 There is a good harbour, with a depth of 12 fathoms, between Engelsholm, Risholm, and Andabelo. Vessels taking the Stroms-fiord passage to Flekkefiord must pass through this anchorage. Abelsn\u00e6s is a small, but very good harbour, to the eastward, and inside ot Andabel Varn\u00e6s, the point north-west of Engelsholm ; there are 5 mooring rings here, and the depth is 12 fathoms, over good holding ground; the harbour itself is perfectly clear, but a shoal extends a short distance to the eastward from Andabel Varn\u00e6s. Between these two harbours there is a good roadstead, which has a depth of 15 to 20 fathoms over stiff mud, and affords fan- anchorage for about a [dozen I vessels. Water can be procured here, but supplies must be sent from Flekkefiord. This roadstead is of considerable importance to strangers, and special directions for it will be found hereafter. See page 62. The western entrance is through Hitero Sund. Tarmevig.\u2014 There is a stopping place for vessels taking the Stols fiord passage, at Tarmevig, a small bay inside a roadstead on the south east side of Andabelo ; the depth is from 8 to 5 fathoms shoaling towards the land. Vessels using this anchorage must give the rock south of Tarmevig, and the point east of the houses, a berth of at least half a cable when entering and leaving the bay. Grundevig is a cove on the east side of Stolsfiord, opposite the Bjorn islands ; it is free from dangers, and offers good and secure anchorage ; the depth is 12 fathoms in the entrance, increasing to 20 fathoms farther in, and shoaling again to 4 fathoms at the inner end. In Flekkefiord vessels may anchor for a time, if necessary, at the following places : viz., between Bjorno and Bolshus in 11 fathoms ; in the creek east of Voldn\u00e6s ; south and west of Kjeo ; close to the mainland"], [77, "CHAP. II.] ENGELSHOLM \u2014 RASVAAG. 59 nearly half a mile south of Fieldsaa, and in the small bay south of Svege point. RASVAAG is a remarkably deep bay on the south side of Hitero ; it has several coves and anchorages, and is of special importance to seamen as affording shelter to vessels which may have been driven into the gulf between Hitero and Lister, and are unable to weather the coast. Rasvaag is protected from the sea by a barrier of small islands and islets stretching across the entrance, and, as there are five different passages between these islands, may be left with all winds except those from S.S.E. to S.S.W. There is a ship-yard at Rasvaag where small vessels may be repaired. Water can always be obtained here, but not supplies. Hummero and Skibholm. \u2014 The southern anchorages in Rasvaag are off the|north points of Hummero and Skibholm, in 14 fathoms, and there is a 7 fathom patch between them which extends about half a cable to the southward from the south point of Kreglingholm. In all the Rasvaag anchorages the bottom consists of sand and clay. Bredvig, on the west side of Rasvaag, inside Kaalo, is a good harbour for large vessels ; there are three mooring rings here, and the depth is 16 fathoms shoaling to 12 towards the shore ; the anchor must be let go, with the houses in Vaulevig, on the opposite side of the bay, well open southward ofthe islet which forms the north-east side ofthe harbour. Bredvig is less exposed to the wind than the anchorages north of Hummero aud Skibholm. Vaage, about three-quarters of a mile farther in on the west side, has 18 fathoms shoaling to 14, and is still more sheltered than Bredvig. Marstad, the innermost bight in Rasvaag, though rather narrow, is the most secure harbour of all ; the depth is 15 fathoms. The above anchorages are available for vessels of war. Vessels of 14 feet draught can anchor in 4 fathoms, in the small harbour between the Rasvaag islets, north-east of Kreglingholni, and between these islets and the mainland is a very snug harbour, sheltered in all weathers, for vessels of 9 to 10 feet draught, but they must be moored head and stern. Vessels of 12 feet draught may pass through Kirkesund to Veisevaag, where the depth is from 16 to 12 fathoms. There are also stopping places at Vaulevig, Urstad, and Helle. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The entrances to Rasvaag are narrow, but not very difficult, and under ordinary circumstances a pilot will be sure to board the vessel in time to take her in ; if a strong gale is blowing dead on shore, with so much sea that the pilot boats cannot beat out against it, it will, generally speaking, be wiser to stand in for Lister Fiord or Hittero Sund."], [78, "60 [CHAP. II- THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. Hummergabet, the easterinost of the five entrances to Rasvaag, lies between Saxeskjer and the coast of Hitero. Midtflua, carrying 3 feet, lies li cables W.N.W. from Saxeskjer ; with this exception the Hummergab is perfectl-\" clear up to Hummero, and from thence into Rasvaag the course lies between Kreglingholm and the islets to the eastward. Immerholmsreuden. \u2014 After passing eastward of Immerholm, the largest of the outlying rocks off Rasvaag, give the rock to the northward a berth of at least half a cable, and keep a long cable westward of Skarveskj er. the next rock on the starboard hand ; give Nautholm a fair berth, leav ing it on the port hand, and when close in to the Hitero coast, steer for the north point of Kreglingholm. Kvisund lies between Store Haugo and Hummero, Nombu is the westernmost of the outlying rocks, Gonseboe 1^ cables S.W. of Nautholm, has one foot over it, and Haugeflua with 3 feet over it, lies about 30 yards eastward of the south point of Store Haugo. After passing southward of Nombu, steer for the southernmost of the islets off Store Haugo, and leave them on the port hand ; give the south point of Store Haugo a fair berth in order to clear Haugeflua, and proceed between Skibholm and Hummero. Udfaldsund, between Urstado and the rocks south-east of Kaa 15, is perfectly straight and clear, and may be taken with all westerly winds between N.W. and S.W. When passing through this sound keep close in to Urstado, and leave all rocks and breakers to the northward. Kaalosund, between Hitero and Kaalo, is the westernmost of the entrances to Rasvaag, and may be taken with the wind from N.N.W., through west to S.W. About'one cable eastward of the north-west point of Kaalo there are shoals on each side of the sound, and the passage between them is extremely narrow. After passing between Treltangen and Krog holm keep well in to Hitero when opposite the north-west point of Kaalo, and proceed in mid-channel, or if anything rather nearer to Hitero, between the shoals further in. KIRKEHAVN, on the north-west side of Hitero, is a good harbour, notwithstanding the swell which is sometimes felt there ; it may be entered with northerly and westerly, and left with southerly and easterly winds. In the bights north and south of the church there are 15 fathoms, over sand and clay. In Steilebugt, inside Steile point, the north-east point of Drago, there are three mooring rings, and the depth is 10 fathoms. About one quarter of a cable from the point west of the church is a rock with one fathom over it. The best entrance is through Havsund, between Pr\u00e6sto and Drago ; when passing between Brato and Drago keep at least half a cable from"], [79, "CHAP. II.] HUMMERGABET \u2014 LISTER FIORD. 61 the north shore of the latter island. To enter Steilebugt, keep in mid channel between Steile point and the islet to the eastward, as there are shoals on each side of the passage. To pass through Krossund, between Pr\u00e6sto and Kaado, give the Sverting rocks (Svertingerwe) a cluster to the north-westward of Pr\u00e6sto, a berth of nearly one cable ; keep nearest to Kaado when entering the sound in order to clear Krossundflua, a rock with 5 fathoms over it, lying three-quarters of a cable N.N.W. from the north point of Pr\u00e6sto, and proceed in mid-channel. There is a stopping-place for small vessels to the south-eastward of Kaado, and south of the islet off the east side of Pr\u00e6sto there is anchorage in 16 fathoms ; when passing this islet give the east point a berth of half a cable to clear a shoal off it, and proceed as directed above. There is also a passage from Hiterosund ; to take which, after passing Store Kaadoflua give Kvalsbierg point, and the islet off the east point of Kaado, a berth of half a cable, and proceed between Brato and Pr\u00e6sto for the anchorage. Gronnevig, on the east side of Drago, is a small harbour, with a depth of 8 fathoms, over a sandy bottom ; this would be found a useful anchorage if a vessel had drifted near the coast in a calm with the current setting inshore, or had met with a scant S.E. wind in attempting to enter Rasvaag ; it should, however, only be resorted to for a short time, or in summer. South-westerly winds send a considerable swell into Gronnevig, and northerly winds are required for getting away. There is not sufficient water in the narrow passage east of Drago for vessels to pass through to Kirkehavn. The coast of Hitero, between Krogholm and Drago, is foul to a distance of at least one cable from the shore, and there is a shoal off the south-west shore of Marebrot, the islet between Gronnevig and Kirkehavn. When entering Gronnevig, keep in mid-channel between the rocks off Drago and Hitero. LISTER FIORD,* between Llitero and Lister, is worthy of special notice, as it is not only more easy of access than any of the ports in the vicinity of the Naze, but also leads to several anchorages where vessels in distress may find refuge. The entrance to Lister Fiord is free from out lying dangers, and at night its position is marked by the Gunnarshaug and Varn\u00e6s lights. With the wind on shore, and the weather so bad that pilots cannot beat out to a vessel in the offing, she may stand boldly in for Lister Fiord, where a pilot from Rasvaag may bo able to board her. Should no pilot come out, the vessel may run straight through Lister Fiord, and directly the channel is open between Hitero and Andabelo, haul to the northward, giving the south-west shore of Andabelo -a good berth, and proceed to Engelsholm, passing at least one cable east * Den Norske Lods, Vol. 3, 1867 ; and Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N. 1875-6."], [80, "62 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap, ii. ward of the islets at Langelands-strand. Should the wind be too scant, or the sea so high, and the gale so strong, that the vessel misses Stroms fiord entrance, she may stand farther in and run along the east side of Andabelo, taking care to avoid the Mosseskjer ledges, which must be left on the port hand. When proceeding to the northward through Stols-fiord, pass at least one cable eastward of Terneholm, and give the Aaleskjer a good berth when rounding them to enter Engelsholm harbour. It is quite possible that the vessel would not be able to fetch this harbour, under the circumstances just mentioned, but a pilot would certainly board her when in sufficiently smooth water, and she could then run on to Flekkefiord. When entering Engelsholm harbour from Stols-fiord, keep within half a cable of the north point of Andabelo, in order to clear the shoals off Risholm. The Aaleskjer are two small rocks above water, lying 2 cables eastward of the north point of Andabelo. At night. \u2014 Having made out Gunnarshaug light, give the point a berth of about 2 miles ; then bring Varn\u00e6s light to bear E.N.E., and steer for it. After passing Varn\u00e6s, at a distance of 2 or 3 cables, bring the light] in line with, or just eastward of, Gunnarshaug light, which will lead into Stroms-fiord ; then Varn\u00e6s light kept open eastward of Klubben, the south point of Hitero, leads straight to Engelsholm. Immediately after passing this islet, it will be best, if there is no pilot on board, to drop the anchor 25 or 30 fathoms under foot, steer about 2 cables to the eastward of 'Andabel Varn\u00e6s, and veer to the necessary scope when the anchor takes the ground. Generally speaking, the obstruction offered by the Mosseskjer ledges to vessels taking the Stolsfiord passage, and the advantage of the lights in facilitating entry into Engelsholm roadstead through Stroms-fiord, mark the latter passage as the only one available for a stranger, by night, unless under the guidance of a pilot. If considered advisible to run into Feddefiord for shelter, care must be taken to keep northward of Elie islets, which lie in the entrance to Eids-fiord, about half way between Varn\u00e6s and Skageflua. The above directions for Lister Fiord are more particularly intended as a guide to strangers in very bad weather, and it may be as well to mention that with a heavy sea on, the dangers off Rasvaag, to the south ward of Hitero, are always indicated by breakers. COAST. \u2014 The coast from Hitero to Ekersund is, generally speaking, lofty and free from outlying dangers, but between Sireaaen, (Sire river,) and Jossing Fiord, there are several small islets, surrounded by rocks above and below water ; these do not, however, extend more than a mile from the coast, and are always indicated by breakers, when there is any"], [81, "CHAP. II.] LISTER FIORD \u2014 BEREFIORD. 63 sea on. There is a narrow passage between these rocks and the mainland, which is frequently used by coasting steam vessels. FOGSTENS. \u2014 The Fogstens, situated three-quarters of a mile east ward of the entrance to Jossing Fiord, are two rocky islets, about two-thirds ofthe height ofthe coast off which they lie ; they resemble haycocks in form, and are so conspicuous, that they may be distinguished at a distance of 8 miles from the coast ; in clear weather some white spots on the south side of the Little Fogsten may be seen even farther. ASPECT Of COAST.\u2014 The coast between Jossing fiord and Reke fiord, a stretch of about 2 miles, presents a very peculiar appearance, as it is entirely covered with grass, and is therefore green during the summer months ; in autumn and winter, when the grass is withered, and before the ground is covered with snow, it has a yellowish appearance. The mountains on either side, both to the eastward and westward, being naked and dark, present a contrast which is very striking. This is the only con spicuous mark of the kind on this part of the coast, and may be seen distinctly from the offing, at a distance of 10 or 12 miles, therefore when land is seen answering to this description it must be the coast of Soggendal. Farther to the southward, Hitero is rendered conspicuous by the openings of the channels separating it from the mainland, which it equals in height ; its outline is, however, more rugged. Beyond Hitero the horizon is bounded by the low land of Lister. SIREGRUNDEN is a bank extending from the mouth of the Sire river about 5 miles W.N.W., and 2 miles to the south-eastward. The north west extreme lies between 2 and 3 miles W.S.W. from Store or Great Fogten, with that islet in line with the entrance to Jossing Fiord ; from thence it extends about 5 miles to the south-eastward, nearly parallel with the coast, with a varying breadth of from one to 3 miles. The depth over this bank varies from 7 to 19 fathoms ; the bottom is rocky and overgrown with seaweed, with the exception of a patch composed of clean sand, which ex tends about a mile and a half to the westward, from the mouth of Sire river. A vessel becalmed on this bank, with the current setting towards the shore, might drop her stream anchor until a breeze sprang up ; the best position is with Hiterosund and Sireaaen open at the same time, in 15 to 19 fathoms. BEREFIORD is a good harbour, about 2 miles westward of Hitero ; the best anchorage is in 14 to 8 fathoms, over sand, northward of a large islet which lies almost in the middle of the entrance to the fiord ; a shoal lies about 20 yards eastward of this islet, otherwise the passages on either side are clear. The usual entrance is through the eastern passage, which is the wider of the two, and .the anchorage may be left by the channel west of the islet, with the wind from W.N.W. through north to E.N.E."], [82, "64 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap. ii. Telebugt, a narrow cove, within a projecting point about three quarters of a mile westward of Berefiord, has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms, over a sandy bottom. It must be a very urgent case that would induce a vessel to seek shelter here, and a pilot well acquainted with the place would be almost indispensable, as the opening cannot be distinguished from seaward even at the distance of one cable. Sireaaen. \u2014 There is good anchorage in Sireaaen, but it, is only available for vessels of 10 feet draught at the outside, on account of a bar across the entrance with barely 2 fathoms over it. A rock carrying 5 feet lies 40 yards westward of Sirekalv, a small islet on the west side of the entrance. From Sanden to Midtbo, the depth is from 7 to 10 fathoms, over stiff clay. It is very difficult to enter this harbour with the wind on shore, as westerly winds, when blowing fresh, raise a heavy sea in the mouth of the river, which occasions a ground swell at the anchorage. A strong current also runs out of Sire river, particularly in the spring when the snows melt on the mountains, and with heavy rains. There is a very remarkable fall, named Helvedesfos, or Hell's Fall, about 3 miles in from the entrance, and 1 i miles above Midtbo. JOSSING FIORD.*\u2014 Should the wind near the land veer so much to the westward or northward as to prevent a vessel entering Reke fiord, she will find good shelter in Jossing Fiord, 3 miles westward of Sireaaen. The entrance to Jossing Fiord is very conspicuous, as it lies between steep and dark mountains. Vessels may pass on either side of the Fogstens, keeping close to them, and when within these islets, the fiord is clear with the exception of a rock carrying H fathoms, in the middle of Vin terstobugt. To pass westward of this rock, keep Store Fogsten touching the point on the west side of the entrance to the fiord. If necessary, a stream anchor might be dropped in 50 fathoms, inside the entrance. The best anchorage is in Vinterstobugt, the first bight on the east side of the fiord, but north-east or easterly winds are required for leaving ; the depth is 16 fathoms outside, and 12 fathoms inside, the above-mentioned rock, over a sandy bottom. There is also anchorage at Guard Holm, about half a mile farther in on the east side, in 16 fathoms. There is very good sea-fishing in Jossing Fiord, and at the inner end of the fiord is a peculiar overhanging cliff, with several houses built right under it. Store Fogsten. \u2014 Iu summer a handy vessel might stop while waiting wind or tide, in a small bight on the east side of Store or Great Fogsten. This bight has a depth of 5 to 6 fathoms, over sand, and may be left with all winds except those from the eastward, which make it rather difficult to get out. * See plan : \u2014 Sogndalstrand and Rekefiord anchorages on Admiralty chart, No. 883, scale m = 1 \u2022 5 inches (in course of preparation)."], [83, "CHAP. II.] JOSSING FIORD \u2014 REKE FIORD. 65 BOEN. \u2014 In approaching the coast between the Fogstens and Reke fiord, care must be taken to avoid Boen, a rock with 6 feet over it, lying fully a mile W. bv N. from Little Fogsten ; a shoal carrying 2 fathoms extends one cable S.S.W. from Boen, and a rock with 2 fathoms over it lies one cable to the south-eastward. About 2\\ cables north-eastward of Boen is a rock which carries 6 fathoms, and there is also a rock with 5| fathoms over it three-quarters of a cable to the north-westward. The Pr\u00e6stskjer beacon, at the entrance to Rekefiord, bearing North, leads eastward of these shoals, the same beacon bearing N.N.E. leads westward, and the two Fogstens exactly in line will lead clear to the north ward. Sogndalstrand, a picturesque little town at the mouth of the Sogndal river, was formerly of little importance, but has increased con siderably in prosperity since the opening of the Blaafield's Titanic iron mines by an English company, and has now about 600 inhabitants. Supplies and water can be procured here. The harbour is exposed to wind, sea, and swell, and should therefore only be used in summer ; it h^j a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms, over a sandy bottom, and is chiefly frequented by vessels engaged in the herring and mackerel fisheries. With the wind from E.S.E., through south to S.W., vessels may pass through Vambelsund, between Langholm and the mainland, and bring up anywhere inside Gr\u00e6sholm. A shoal with 3 feet over it extends from Gr\u00e6sholm about half a cable to the south-east. In spring and autumn, and after heavy rains, a strong current runs out through Vambelsund from Sogndal river. There is also a western entrance, known as the Skibslob, which may be taken by vessels of 12 to 14 feet draught, with the wind from N.N.W. to W.S.W. ; this passage is very narrow, and in heavy weather appears to be filled with breakers. The Look-out House on the hill west of the town, in line with the east point of Tyveholm, leads in between the outer dangers, and when within a quarter of a cable of Tyveholm, the remainder of the passage is clear. REKE FIORD, immediately westward of Sogndalstrand, is a station of some importance, on account of its vicinity to Sogndal, an extensive and richly cultivated valley, and the Blaafield iron mines. These mines are about 7 miles from Rekefiord, and the ore is brought down through Sogndal by a private railway, and shipped from a wharf at the inner end of the fiord. Supplies may be brought from Sogndalstrand overland; there is a good road, and the distance is about 2\\ miles ; the easiest way, however, is to send a boat round, when the weather permits. K 740. E"], [84, "66 [chap, ii- THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. Rekefiord is best adapted to southward-bound vessels, northerly winds being generally required for leaving ; in fine weather, however, it may be left even with the wind at East. Westerly winds blow in rather than out of the fiord, but in leaving with a scant wind, there is the advantage of being able to warp out to the outer point, by means of the posts placed on the shore on either side of the inlet. Northerly winds occasion very heavy squalls from the clefts in the mountains. PILOTS. \u2014 A pilot will always be found waiting within the entrance to Rekefiord to conduct a vessel to her anchorage, should the weather render it impossible for boats to venture outside. Beacon. \u2014 There is a white stone beacon on Lille or Little Pr\u00e6steskjer, a small islet on the west side of the entrance to Rekefiord, which is very conspicuous from the offing. Landmark. \u2014 It has already been mentioned that Rekefiord is the western boundary of that part of the coast which is covered with verdure, so that on the east side of the fiord the land is green or yellowish, while on the west side it is barren and dark ; this landmark, together with Lille Pr\u00e6steskjer beacon, clearly indicates the situation of the entrance, and a vessel might stand boldly in for it, should the weather be too rough for a pilot to board her in the offing. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 In the outer roadstead, just inside the entrance to Rekefiord, there are 25 fathoms, over clean sand, and close to the north-east ward of Pr\u00e6steskjer, the depth is 14 to 16 fathoms, over clay ; these anchor ages are, however, much exposed to sea and swell. In the bay between Ganvigodden, (the first point on the east side inside Valn\u00e6s,) and Oveodden, on which stands the Look-out House, there are 16 fathoms over clay; this is perhaps the best anchorage in the fiord, and, if necessary, even frigates might be hove down here and repaired. About 20 fathoms out from the mooring ring at Havne, inside Ganvig point, is a rock with 7 feet over it, which is generally marked by a buoy in summer. Farther in, there is anchorage in the Ymersten bight in 12 fathoms, and also in Hage bight, on the opposite side of the fiord, but several sunken rocks lie right in the fairway, to the northward of Ove point. Vessels may pass on either side of Knaphulholm, a small islet which lies almost in the middle of the entrance to the inner anchorage, and bring up off the end of the wharf in 5 to 6 fathoms. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When entering Rekefiord, keep in mid-channel between Pr\u00e6steskjer and Valn\u00e6s, shortening sail according to circum stances. The depth here is 30 fathoms, and shoals steadily up to Ganvig point, where the passage appears to be very narrow when standing in ; there are, however, 12 fathoms close up to the rocks on either side. To"], [85, "CHAP. II.] 67 REKEFIORD \u2014 VAAGENE. pass to Ymersten bight, keep quite close to the land on the west side of the fiord after passing Ove point, in order to clear Lammen\u00e6sflua, which has 3 feet over it, and lies half a cable from Lammen\u00e6s. Ovesten, a rock with 6 feet over it, lies three-quarters of a cable N.W. by N, from Oveskjer, the northernmost ofthe two small islets opposite Lammen\u00e6s and Oveflua, which latter carries 4 feet, lies one quarter of a cable W.N.W. from the same islet. Pr\u00e6steskjer beacon, visible eastward of the point on the west side of the entrance to the fiord, leads eastward of Lammen\u00e6sflua and Ovesten, and westward of Oveflua. Nordfiord, an inlet westward of the entrance to Rekefiord, is a narrow, but very good and sheltered harbour, with a depth of 1 1 to 6 fathoms, shoaling gradually towards the inner end of the fiord ; the bottom consists of mud. The entrance between Pr\u00e6steskjer and Nord fiordholm may be taken by vessels of 15 to 16 feet draught, with the wind from E.N.E., round southerly to S.W. Nordfiordflue, a rock with 2 fathoms over it, lies in the middle of the passage, but it is marked by an iron pole ; after passing close to the east ward of this pole, vessels must haul to the westward in order to clear a reef which projects from the channel between Pr\u00e6steskjer and the main land. This entrance is very narrow, and the whole space appears to be filled with breakers, when there is any sea on, but once inside, the fiord is perfectly clear. There is also an entrance between Nordfiordholm and the mainland, but though free from dangers, it is extremely narrow. Nordfiord may be left with all northerly winds from E.N.E. to W.N.W. Westerly winds always turn more northerly within the anchorage, owing to the direction of the fiord, so that a vessel may easily get away with these winds, and also clear the coast if bound to the eastward, provided the weather be moderate. COAST. \u2014 The coast from Rekefiord to Ekero, a distance of about 12 miles, is lofty and steep, and may be approached to within 2 or 3 cables, as all the dangers are near the shore. There are no good places of shelter on this reach, and the following anchorages should only be resorted to in cases of extreme necessity, or in fine weather. Vaagene. \u2014 There are two small anchorages inside the Vaage islets 1^ ihiles westward of Rekefiord. In the northernmost bight, inside the islet south of N\u00e6svaag, there are 7 fathoms over sand ; the entrance is between the two northernmost Vaage islets. A sunken rock in the middle of the passage must be left on the starboard, and a shoal off the north islet on the port hand, when standing in. There is also a rock in the e 2"], [86, "68 THE NAZE TO EKERSUND. [chap- ii. middle of the bight, but it is always awash ; vessels must pass to the eastward of it, when entering or leaving the harbour. In the bight off Stien, there is anchorage for two or three vessels in 12 fathoms, over a sandy bottom, but between the islets inside the harbour, the depth is only 3 feet. Vessels of 13 to 14 feet draught may enter between the second and third islets from the northward, with the wind from S.E., through south to N.W., or if coming from the southward, they may keep close in to the mainland, and run along shore; the latter passage is, how ever, extremely narrow and foul, and should only be taken with the assist ance of a local pilot. South-westerly gales send a considerable swell into these anchorages, and Stien bight is but little sheltered from any sea wind. NSBSVaag, a narrow inlet immediately westward of the Vaage islets, is a tolerably sheltered harbour for two or three small vessels, but in order to lie there with perfect security in winter, it is best to haul into the inner part of the bight and moor ; the depth is from 4 to 6 fathoms. Northerly winds are required for leaving. Dybvaag or Mong, 4 miles north-westward of the Vaage islets, has 5 fathoms water, two mooring rings, and room for two or three vessels drawing at the outside 16 feet. With northerly and westerly winds, vessels may pass on either side of Bomvigflue, which has 4 fathoms over it and lies one cable westward of the north Lyrskjer, and between the latter rock and the mainland, but the channel is extremely narrow, and there are shoals on each side ; there is also a heavy swell with south westerly gales. Naalevig is a bight on the east side of Stapn\u00e6s. There is anchorage for small craft in 4 fathom water off Odden, in the innermost part of the inlet, but the entrance is so narrow and difficult, that it should only be attempted by those well acquainted with the locality."], [87, "69 CHAPTER III. EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. Variation- in 1880. Ekersund 16\u00b0 45' W. | Hvidingso 17\u00b0 00' W. EKERSUND* is built on the east side of the sound between Ekero and the mainland ; it is the principal commercial town between the Naze and Stavanger, and is the head-quarters of the mackerel fishery on this part of the coast : the population is about 2,300. There are several potteries here, but, owing principally to the low duty on English imported ware, their business has greatly diminished of late years. A railway is in course of construction to connect Ekersund with Stavanger. An English vice-consul resides at Ekersund. Supplies and water may be obtained, and there is a place where vessels of about 14 feet draught may be hove down and repaired. The actual harbour of Ekersund, within Lindo, is only available for very small vessels ; the greatest depth, 12 feet, is between the rows of warping posts and the wharves. At the west end of the town; however, there is sufficient water for large steam vessels to lie alongside the outermost wharf. In the sound to the westward of Lindo there is very good anchorage, available for the largest vessels, in 6 to 8 fathoms, over clay and sand. There are two entrances to Ekersund, one to the northward and the other to the eastward of Ekero, but the former is only available for vessels drawing 13 or, at the outside, 14 feet. COAST. \u2014 When approaching Ekero from the westward, the low land of J\u00e6deren will be distinctly visible to the northward, if the weather is tolerably clear. Ekero will resemble a high promontory, and the coast to the south-eastward will appear very lofty and precipitous. The opening of the northern entrance to Ekersund will also be clearly visible. On nearing the coast vessels should always, if possible, endeavour to give the pilots a chance of reaching on board with the wind free. All the dangers lie near the shore, and those which are not visible above water are indicated by breakers. From the southward. \u2014 When approaching from the southward Ekero will appear like a lofty promontory projecting from a high and abrupt coast, and the Bay of Lnndevig will be distinctly seen ; this is the * See plan : \u2014 Approaches to Ekersund on Admiraly chart, No 883, scale m = 1-5 inches (in course of preparation), and Admiralty chart: \u2014 Norway, south-west coast, the Naze to Karmo, No. 2,281."], [88, "70 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO.

Haadyr point, 7 miles south-eastward of Ekero, is a very conspicuous landmark; it resembles a perpendicular wall of rock, with a sharp and slightly pro jecting peak, at the upper and outer extremity. LIGHTS.\u2014 Ekero. \u2014 On the west point of Ekero stands a round iron tower, which exhibits a fixed white light, elevated 154 feet, and visible in clear weather from a distance of 20 miles. The tower, which is 108 feet high, is painted red, with a white belt 24 feet broad. Vibberodden. \u2014 On the islet off Vibberodden, the point on the west side of the southern entrance to Ekersund, is a yellow wooden lighthouse 30 feet high, from which is exhibited a fixed white light, ele vated 73 feet, and visible 9 miles in clear weather between the bearings of N by E. through west and south to S. by W. Grundsund Holm. \u2014 A fixed white light is exhibited at an elevation of 43 feet, from a wooden lighthouse on Grundsund Holm, on the south side of the northern entrance to Ekersund ; it is visible 9 miles between the bearings of N.E. by E. \u00a3 E., and E. \u00a3 N. The light house is 30 feet high, and is painted yellow. SOUTHERN ENTRANCE.\u2014 All vessels drawing more than 13 or 14 feet must take the southern entrance to Ekersund ; this channel is also by far the easiest and safest. With the wind from E.S.E., through south to W.S.W., vessels may stand in to the eastward of Stabs\u00e6t and M\u00e6rra. Give the latter rock, which is always awash, a berth of at least 2 cables, but take care at the same time to keep Fugleodden open westward of the point on the east side of the entrance, in order to clear the Isak rocks, over which there are 3 fathoms. Jensboen has H fathoms over it, and lies 1J cables to the southward of Stabs\u00e6t. When past M\u00e6rra, steer for Vibberodden lighthouse, and give the point opposite to it a fair berth ; then keep in mid-channel through the passage and bring up according to circumstances. If coming from the westward, vessels may stand in to the northward of Svetling islands, taking care to avoid Storeflue and the outer Bronn\u00e6s shoals, the former has one foot over it and lies 2 cables S.S.E. of Kids Holm, the latter carry from \\\\ to 3^ fathoms, (and lie 2\\ cables from the point south of Lyngholm. There is also a good channel between Stabs\u00e6t and Little Svetling, but one ca,ble S.E. of the latter islet lies Glaane, a rock with about one foot of water over it. AT NIGHT.\u2014 The south-west limit of Vibberodden light falls eastward of Jensboen and M\u00e6rra. When within three miles of the light be eareful not to bring it to bear westward of North. Inside the channel"], [89, "71 CHAP. III.] EKERSUND; DIRECTIONS. the north-east limit of the light falls just eastward of Fugleodden and the Rodholm shoal, which has 4 feet over it. Tides. \u2014 The tidal stream always runs out, or to the southward, through the southern entrance to Ekersund, and is sometimes very strong. ANCHORAGE.\u2014 When past Vibberodden, vessels may, if necessary, bring up anywhere in the sound in from 25 to 8 fathoms, over sand and clay ; there is also anchorage at the following places. Skiroldvig, on the east side of the entrance to the sound, has a depth of 11 fathoms, over a sandy bottom, and there are two mooring rings in the bight inside the houses. This anchorage might be used if the wind should veer to the northward of West, and prevent a vessel from proceeding up to Ekersund, but a heavy sea sets in when the wind blows fresh from the south-westward. Morteflue, carrying 3 feet, lies three-quarters of a cable E.N.E. from the north point of Tingels\u00e6t. Vessels may pass on either side of the latter islet, and bring up in 11 fathoms when Little Svetling is in line with Dyrn\u00e6s. Gillestad bight is about half a mile inside Vibberodde ; the largest vessels may bring up opposite the mooring rings in 10 fathoms, over sand and clay, with Fugleodden touching Varberg point. A shoal extends S.S.W. three-quarters of a cable from the islet off the point on the north side of the bight. Hovlandsvig, is a good spacious anchorage available for the largest vessels, the depth is 10 fathoms, over clay. About the middle of the bay, a reef with 2 feet over it extends half a cable from the mainland, and there is also a shoal off the point at the north extreme of the harbour. Vessels may bring up anywhere between Hovlandsvig and Ekersund in 7 to 8 fathoms, over clay ; but they should moor with a stream anchor. NORTHERN ENTRANCE.\u2014 There is anchorage throughout the whole sound north of Ekero in 6 to 8 fathoms, over sand and \u2022 clay ; the best place is, however, between Horsholm and Grundsund Holm in 5 fathoms, over sand. Vessels drawing less than 14 feet may take the channel north of Horsholm, but those of greater draught must enter between the rocks off Horsholm and Seilsten. South Of SundSgabholm.\u2014 Should no pilot have boarded the vessel before she gets well into the bay off the north entrance, she may stand in to the northward of Seilsten, which is very conspicuous at the distance of 2 miles or so, being a lofty perpendicular rock resembling a large spritsail. On nearing the entrance, course must be steered to pass about li cables northward of Seilsten, in order to clear Seilstenflue."], [90, "72 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [chap, in- Trye, a rock above water lying in the fairway, has an iron pole on it, and may be passed on either side at a distance of about half a cable ; a shoal, with lh fathoms over it, extends about half a cable from Trye towards Grundsund Holm. After passing Trye, give Gul Holm and Luseskjer a good berth, passing to the southward of them ; and bring up south-west of Grundsund Holm in 10 fathoms, or proceed to the anchorage east of Horsholm. At night. \u2014 The northern limit of Grundsund Holm light falls just southward of Gul Holm, and the southern limit falls westward of Boieflue and the shoals off the north-west point of Midtbrodo ; Trye lies just within the southern limit of the light, therefore when standing in at night vessels should keep as much to the northward as possible without obscuring the light. The light will be hidden when steering to the northward past Luseskjer, and when it again becomes visible the vessel will be well within the anchorage. North of SundSgabholm. \u2014 The northernmost of the houses at Myklebostad, exactly over Hoivigodde, (the easternmost ofthe north points of Sundsgabholm) will lead northward of Dyroflua, a rock with 3 feet over it, which lies about one cable south of Dyroskjer. To pass south ward of Dyroflua, keep Klumphammer about its own width to the north ward of the north point of Sundsgabholm. Sundsgabsten, the western most of the north points of Sundsgabholm, just visible to the northward of Lure Holm, will lead between Dyroflua and the shoal extending to the northward from Svartskjer ; when past Hoivigodde, vessels of over 14 feet draught must bring up in 6 fathoms, over sand and clay. A sand bank extends from Klumphammer to Horsholm, and from thence in a semicircular direction to the eastward, bending down again to Grundsund Holm, there are 1| to 2\\ fathoms over this bank, the greatest depth being about one-third of a cable to the northward of Horsholm and Grundsund Holm. From Grundsund Holm to the eastward, the passage is narrow in places, but, if necessary, an anchor may be dropped anywhere. A sunken rock lying southward of Kraakeskjer is marked by a staff and broom. Shoals extend about a quarter of a cable to the westward from the islet east of Haahellerholm, and one cable to the westward from the north point of Leidland. Esandgrund, on the west side of the passage between Aspero and Ekero, is marked by a staff and broom. A broad shoal, with 2 feet over it, lies one cable westward of the entrance to Kidfiord, at the inner end of which is the mouth of the Theings, said to be a good salmon river. Before coming to Nysund, vessels may bring up in 5 fathoms, between Aspero and Nysandsodden, but they must be careful not to stand too far in"], [91, "CHAP. III.] EKERSUND \u2014 LUNDEVIG. 73 on account of a shoal which extends about one cable from the south-east side of the island. Nysund, south of Aspero, is a very narrow artificial passage ; the navigable channel is marked by four staff and broom beacons, two on each side, and the passage between them is from 10 to 12 fathoms wide, and 14 feet deep ; there are T irons in the rocks on each side, for mooring or warping hawsers. The tidal streams set with great velocity through this channel. Troldflue, Nyaasflue, and Langholmsflue, lying southward of Nysund, are all marked by staff and broom beacons. There is shoal water between Tyve islets and the mainland, and also between the islets themselves. LUNDEVIG. \u2014 The extensive bay of Lundevig divides Ekero into two parts, which are connected by a narrow neck of low land ; it is remark ably conspicuous from the offing, as the land is lofty on both sides, and the inner part is bounded by a low shore composed of white sand. When approaching Ekero with the wind on shore, and the weather too heavy for pilots to come out, vessels may safely stand in between Fliset and Kidsholm ; there are several rocks and shoals round these islets, but the sea always breaks on them in heavy weather; inside the bay the dangers are all near the land. Having entered Lundevig, the vessel may either be hove-to when the water becomes smoother, to wait for a pilot, or she may stand further in, keeping about 2 cables from the land on the west side, the depth is about 40 fathoms in the entrance ; from thence it decreases gradually to the northward, and about the middle of the bay, with Skad berg in line with Oxn\u00e6s, and the houses at Bjaana, between Segleim and Midtbrod, in line with Hoddenhammer, there is a 14 fathom patch of stony ground; inside of this bank there are 10 to 12 fathoms, shoaling regularly to the northward, over a clean sandy bottom. Another good place to anchor is about one cable N.E. of Hoddenhammer, and the same distance S.E. of Aalebergflue, which is nearly always dry ; the depth here is 6 fathoms. Both these anchorages are somewhat exposed to sea and swell. LdningSVaag, on the east side of Lundevig inside Loningo, has two harbours, which are separated by a bank with 7 feet over it. In the southern anchorage there is 3 fathoms water, and room for three or four small craft, but the entrance is difficult, and should not be attempted with out a pilot. Vessels may pass on either side of Kandeflue, which has 11 fathoms over it, and lies about one cable S.S.W. from lngeborgskjer, and bring up in the north harbour in 9 fathoms ; but sailing vessels can only enter this anchorage with northerly and westerly winds. The north harbour has"], [92, "74 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [chat. Ill two mooring rings, and room for about twelve vessels, steadied by shore hawsers ; in case of necessity, one or two large merchant vessels, or even a frigate, might take shelter here. Sprang bight is a good summer harbour at the north-east end of Lundevig, inside the Vaar rocks ; the depth is 6 to 7 fathoms. South westerly gales send in some swell, but there are no dangers within the rocks at the entrance. If standing in to the westward of the Vaar rocks, give them a fair berth, and take care to avoid a shoal, with 2\\ fathoms over it, which extends three-quarters of a cable S.S.W. from Oxn\u00e6s. When taking the eastern entrance, give Sandvigholm a berth of about half a cable, in order to clear the rocks to the south-westward and northward of it, and keep well in to Ekero when passing Vaar rocks, as a shoal extends three-quarters of a cable to the south-eastward of them. RoUSVaag, just inside the entrance to Lundevig on the west side, is a snug little cove, with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms, two mooring rings, and room for about a dozen small craft not exceeding 12 feet draught. A rock with 9 feet over it lies nearly in the middle of the entrance, which is extremely narrow ; vessels must always pass to the southward of this rock, but at the same time they must not keep too close to the land on the south side of the entrance, as there is shoal water near it. MIDTBRODVAAG is a very good and secure anchorage, between Midtbrodo and Ekero ; it has a depth of 6 fathoms, over sand, but the entrance is very narrow : southward bound vessels may put in here when detained by contrary winds. There is shoal water all round the rocks on the west side of the entrance, therefore, after giving the south point of Rosholm a berth of at least half a cable, vessels must keep close in to Ekero ; when the anchorage opens out, they may steer more to the west ward and enter the harbour. The best berth is west of Ringeskjer, a small rock in the middle of the sound ; a broad shoal extends about, one cable to the southward from this rock. GEIS BEL GEN. \u2014Inside Dyro, to the northward of the north entrance to Ekersund, are the two Geisbelg harbours, which are separated by a reef with 1\\ fathoms over it, extending from Dyro to the mainland ; on either side of this reef there are 4 fathoms, over a sandy bottom. Both these harbours are exposed to the sea with southerly winds, and they should only be used when adverse winds or currents prevent a vessel from reaching the anchorage east of Horsholm. Vessels may put to sea from Geisbelgen with all easterly winds ; and with the wind from the northward and westward they may proceed to Horsholm. South Geisbelg harbour. \u2014 Storvarden, just open to the south ward of Dyro, will lead between Dyroflua and Svartskjerflue, and westward"], [93, "75 CHAP. III.] SPRANG BIGHT \u2014 VATNEMOHOLMEN. of a 4-fathom shoal lying three-quarters of a cable southward of the south-east point of Dyro ; give the latter point a berth of about a quarter of a cable, and proceed in mid-channel to the anchorage. North Geisbelg harbour. \u2014 The eastern edge of Oiaflua, a broad shoal with from 2 to 3 feet over it, lies one cable N.W. of Rodskjer ; just to the southward of Rodskjer is the extreme of a shoal with one fathom over it, which extends three-quarters of a cable W.N.W. from Dyroskjer ; a shoal about three-quarters of a cable in length lies half-way between Rodskjer and Little Seilsten ; three-quarters of a cable to the westward of the latter rock is a patch with one fathom over it ; and a 3-fathom patch lies about the same distance to the northward. Varberg, just south of the houses in Trossevig, leads in between Oiaflua and Rodskjer ; when pass the latter rock course must be altered for Skjerpskjer, and the shoals off Little Seilsten will be cleared by giving that rock a berth of a good cable when steering for the anchorage. The above entrance to the north harbour is generally considered the best, but vessels may also enter through Skjerping sound, to the northward of the Skjerping islets. Thorsflue is a shoal with 2 feet over it, which lies about three-quarters of a cable westward of the southermost Skjerping islet ; when standing to the northward for Skjerping sound, give the last-mentioned islet a berth of about one cable, and steer for the west point of Store, or Great Skjerping. Storvarden, about the middle of Skjerping sound, or if anything rather nearer the land on the north side of the entrance, will lead between the shoals on either hand ; and the same course must be kept after passing through the sound until the vessel is well past the Hobman, when she may proceed for the anchorage. Hobman rock is nearly always dry, and lies 1^ cables S.E. from the north point of Store Skjerping ; a shoal extends from the islet to the rock, and half a cable beyond the latter to the south-eastward. Three quarters of a cable westward of the north-west point of Trossevigland is a rock with one foot over it, and from thence a shoal extends a long cable to the southward, parallel with the land. VATNEMOHOLMEN.\u2014 Inside the islets off Vatnemo, a long mile to the northward of Skjerping islets, there is very good anchorage for about a dozen vessels of 18 feet draught, in 4 to 8 fathoms ; there are numerous mooring rings here. Southern entrance. \u2014 North Hellareu, a rock lying 3 cables S.W. of Ledersundholm, is always awash, and the sea breaks on it con stantly ; South Hellaren, three-quarters of a cable S.E. from North Hellaren, has 3 feet over it, and three-quarters of a cable N.E. from North Hellaren is the south end of Underboskoltene, a shoal with H fathoms over it, which extends li cables in a north and south direction. Maagegrund, a patch"], [94, "76 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSS. [chap. III. with H fathoms over it, lies three-quarters of a cable south of Maageholm. In addition to these dangers there are several shoals off the south entrance with from 2 to 12 fathoms over them, but their position will be best understood from the chart, and in heavy weather the sea nearly always breaks on them. Inside the outer islets a shoal extends from Tue point to Guleskjer; and a rock lies in the fairway a good half cable S.S.E. from Little Varholm, but it is always awash and may be left on either hand. With Easterly or E.N.E. winds it is best to stand in to the eastward of Hellaren, keeping Synesvarden in line with the houses at Tuen until the west end of the line of houses at Vatnemoholm is half way between Svartskjer and Ledersundholm ; the latter mark will lead into the harbour. With the wind from East round southerly to S.W. keep Synesvarden in line with the east end of Vatnemoholmen houses, which will lead westward of Hellaren ; and on nearing Svartskjer haul up to the north-eastward till Ekero lighthouse is almost in line with Tue point, when course may be altered for the anchorage. Western entrance.\u2014 There are several shoals to the northward of the western entrance, but they are close in to the shore, and are easily avoided ; Porthundene, three rocks on a broad shoal in the fairway, arc always awash, and the sea breaks on them continually. With the wind from N.N.E. through west to S.W., vessels may enter with the south point of Fortunholm in the middle of the sound between Store Varholm and the mainland, taking care at the same time to keep the white circle round the mooring ring on the former islet just clear of the point on the north side of the entrance. With N.N.E. winds it is best to stand in to the northward and east ward of the Porthundene, keeping Skandsfield in line with Skarveskjer in order to clear Kinnervaagskolt, a shoal with 4 fathoms over it, which lies one cable W.S.W. from Kinnervaagskjer. Havrehest, a rocking stone with a beacon on it to the southward of Havre, in line with the inner point of Kinnervaagskjer, leads to the eastward of the Porthun dene. From Vatnemoholmen to Sirevaag there are numerous dangers within a short distance of the coast ; these will be cleared by keeping Seilsten outside of, or in line with, the outermost of the Skjerpin\" islets. SIREVAAG is a tolerably good harbour, about 2 miles north of Vatnemoholmen; just inside the entrance the depth is 13 fathoms it decreases to 5 and 4 fathoms farther in, and in the inner part of the bight is> barely 6 feet : large vessels should not anchor in less than 11 or 12 fathoms. There is room for about ten vessels here, but they must be steadied"], [95, "77 CHAP. III.] VATNEMOHOLMEN\u2014 J\u00c6DEREN. b3' hawsers made fast to the rings on shore. The entrance is very narrow. North-westerly gales send rather a heavy swell into Sirevaag, and it can only be left with southerly and easterly winds ; on the whole, therefore, it should only be taken in cases of necessity, when no other harbour is available. Skjevlingflue, a patch with one fathom over it, lies three-quarters of a cable north of Skjevlingskjer, the outermost of the small rocks to the west ward of Sirevaag. Vaagsgabgrund is a broad shoal off the entrance ; and a rock with 9 feet over it lies at the inner end of this shoal, three-quarters of a cable from the land on each side. To pass northward of Vaagsgabgrund, keep Ogne church in line with Skarveskjer, and when the point at the west side of the entrance comes in line with Nygaard buildings, steer direct for the entrance ; the last mentioned course leads half a cable to the eastward of Vaagsgabgrund, and is the best and easiest line of approach. Veden, in line with Bratfield, will lead between Skjeolingflue and Vaagsgabgrund. OGNE BUGTEN. \u2014 To the northward of Sirevaag is a large bay known as Ogne Bugten, or Ogne bight ; it is 2\\ miles across, and over one mile in depth. At the south-east end of this bay there is anchorage in 3 to 4 fathoms, over sand, inside Holmeflue, a rock which is always awash, and lies 1\\ cables north of the outermost of the Ogne islets. In the north-east part of the bay is a small islet named Rauna ; a shoal extends from the mainland to this islet, and about one cable beyond it ; at 2 cables south of Rauna is a rock known as Angleskjer, which dries at low water. There is anchorage to the eastward of Rauna, off Holmesto, in 3 to 5 fathoms, over sand ; but both here and inside Holmeflue vessels are completely exposed to the sea. Krokken is a sunken rock, with 8^ fathoms over it, lying 1\\ miles S.W. by S. from Rauna; Fristhuset has 6 fathoms over it, and lies three-quarters of a mile westward of Rauna ; and Raunaflua, which carries b\\ fathoms, lies a short mile N.W. of the same islet. Varhaug church, seen just outside Haarpoint, leads westward of these dangers and the shoals off Nygaard. J\u00c6DEREN. \u2014 At Sirevaag the mountainous coast begins to drop towards the sea, and immediately to the northward is situated the low land of J\u00e6deren. This part of the coast is so low that on approaching it from the offing the houses will appear to rise straight from the sea ; at 4 or 5 miles inland a range of hills, presenting however no very con spicuous landmarks, rises from the plain. From Sirevaag to Vigdelds field, a distance of 24 miles, the beach is composed of perfectly white sand ; there are no harbours on this reach, and but few outlying islets : off the north end of J\u00e6deren, however, there is an extensive group of islands and"], [96, "78 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [chap III. rocks, while the coast to the southward is lofty, and trends in a southerly direction. J\u00e6deren is one of the most peculiar tracts of land in Norway ; its surface is undulating, and occasionally rises into low hillocks ; extensive bogs dotted with peat stacks are varied by heather covered tracts and luxuriant meadows and farm lands ; and here and there at rare intervals are small groups of trees. The whole plain is. covered with stones of various sizes, and is intersected by a perfect network of stone walls ; extensive plantations are being made both by Government and private individuals ; and it is believed that coal may be found here. The railway from Ekersund to Stavanger will pass over J\u00e6deren. The inhabitants of this district derive a consider able income from the salmon fishery in the numerous small rivers which intersect the plain ; amongst the principal of these are the Haa and Figgen rivers, on each of which an extensive fish-hatching establishment has been constructed. Immense quantities of plover's eggs are collected on the plain, and in one season alone about 50,000 were shipped for England; game is also plentiful, hares being the commonest variety. J\u00c6DERENS REV, or REEF, is a low projecting point 15 miles northward of Ogne Bugten, and about 10 miles south of Tananger ; a dangerous reef extends from this point nearly 3 cables to the south westward. Daymark. \u2014 A conspicuous triangular daymark stands on J\u00e6derens Rev ; it is visible from a distance of 4 to 6 miles in clear weather, and consists of one upright and two sloping beams, which are joined together at the top ; from the apex of this beacon is suspended a smaller triangle. Landmarks. \u2014 Two miles northward of Ogne Bugten is Gaarden Haar, or Haar farm ; this is a conspicuous landmark, as it stands higher than any of the houses in its vicinity, and appears to be built on a point. The highest point of J\u00e6deren is Obrestadbrekke, 7 miles northward of Haar, and between these two points is Varhaug church. Orre church, 2 miles south of J\u00e6derens Rev, is also a conspicuous land mark, as it stands close to the shore and is perfectly white. Store Haasten, or Feisten, lying 4 miles from Tanangerhaug, is conspicuous amongst the islands off the north end of J\u00e6deren ; it looks something like a hat when seen from the southward, is much higher than any of the surrounding group, and may be seen from a distance of 12 to 16 miles. In clear weather the high mountains on the Bukn islands will also be visible farther to the northward. LIGHTS. \u2014 On the summit of Obrestadbrekke stands a gray stone lighthouse, 30 feet high, which has the appearance of an ordinary dwelling house ; from the gable end, facing the sea, a fixed white light, varied by a"], [97, "chap, in.] 79 J\u00c6DERENS REV \u2014 DANGERS. flash every thirty seconds, is exhibited at an elevation of 109 feet, and should be visible 17 miles in clear weather j the south-eastern limit of the light falls about one mile westward of Haar. Lille Feisten.\u2014 A fixed red light, elevated 68 feet, and visible 9 miles, is exhibited from the roof of a lighthouse on the south-east point of Lille Feisten, 4i miles northward of J\u00e6derens Rev. The lighthouse is 37 feet high. PILOTS. \u2014 There are very few dangers off J\u00e6deren, to the south ward of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s, and most of them are within half a mile of the shore, so that under ordinary circumstances a vessel may safely stand in towards Obrestadbrekke for a pilot. Tides.* \u2014 The tides begin to be perceptible off J\u00e6derens Rev, where there is sometimes a rise of one foot. Northward of this point the streams take their regular course, the flood setting to the northward, and the ebb to the southward, at the rate of one to two knots an hour ; they are, however, affected by the winds to such an extent that they some times set in one direction for days together, but always run strongest to the northward. Rocket Stations. \u2014 There are rocket stations at Kvalben, Husv\u00e6g. Obrestadbrekke, and J\u00e6derens Rev. DANGERS. \u2014 The following are the principal dangers southward of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s. Obrestadgrunden, a 2 fathom shoal with several rocks on it carry ing 5 to 6 feet, extends nearly 4 cables W.S.W. from Obrestadbrekke. The outermost of the houses at Husv\u00e6g, well open to the westward of Varhaug church, leads westward of this danger. Skeillua is a rock carrying 7 feet, which lies 4 cables S.W. of Vigtangen, and about 3 miles northward of Obrestadbrekke. A broad shoal extends about 4 cables from the shore at Vig, and on this shoal, 2 cables W.N.W. from Vigtangen, is a rock named Vigbo, which is always awash. These dangers will be cleared by keeping the daymark on J\u00e6derens Rev to the eastward of N.N.E. Nunhaug, carrying 12 fathoms, lies 1-j2^ miles N.W. from Haug taugen at Vig. Lille Feisten, open westward of J\u00e6derens Rev, leads outside the Nunhaug. Bollen, lying 4| cables to the northward of J\u00e6derens Rev, and 2\\ cables from the nearest land, is generally visible above water ; Skar stengrund, a broad shoal with 2 to 4 fathoms over it, extends 3 cables to the northward from Bollen. * Den Norske Lods, Vol. 3, 1867."], [98, "80 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [chap. III. Vidgrund is a broad 4-fathom patch, about half a mile N.W. of J\u00e6derens Rev ; Orre church, open westward of the outermost breakers on J\u00e6derens Rev, leads clear to the southward and westward. In fine weather small vessels may pass eastward of Vidgrund and Bollen, keeping about one cable from the mainland, the depth in the channel being from 4 to 6 fathoms. The outer breakers on J\u00e6derens Rev. in line with Obrestad brekke, will lead between Vidgrund and Bollen. ClaUSgrund, with 2 fathoms over it, lies 1T% miles N.W. from J\u00e6derens Rev ; and Pigflua, which carries 5 fathoms, lies 1^ miles north ward of the same point. Skaademedgrund, carrying 8 fathoms, lies 3 miles N.N.W. from J\u00e6derens Rev. Marks. \u2014 Tangerhaug, a small hillock close to the shore about I| miles S.E. from Lille Feisten, in line with Tormovarden on Hellestofield, leads eastward of Clausgrund and Pigflua ; and Lille Feisten, in line with Vigdeldsn\u00e6s, leads between Skaademedgrund and Clausgrund. A vessel will be outside all the dangers just mentioned as long as the highest peak on West Bukn island is open westward of Store Haasten, and they may also be cleared by keeping the latter island bearing eastward of N.N.E. When Orre church bears eastward of S.E., the vessel will be southward of J\u00e6derens Rev. Havboen is a sunken rock carrying 3 feet, which lies about 6 cables S.W. by S. from Lille Feisten ; a shoal with 4 feet on it extends one quarter of a cable southward from Havboen. Spretten is a rocky ledge which carries from 2 to 3 feet, and extends 1^ cables S.W. from the rocks off the south end of Lille Feisten. Krogen has 9 feet over it, and lies half a mile N.E. by N. from Lille Feiesten ; the sea breaks at intervals on this rock, when there is the least swell on. Northward Of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s.\u2014 The dangers and anchorages northward of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s are described under the directions for Stavanger. Anchorage. \u2014 It has already been mentioned that there are no regular harbours between Sirevaag and Vigdeldsn\u00e6s, but in addition to the an chorages in Ogne Bugten, small vessels might bring up at any of the following places according to circumstances. Seilvaag, a small bight near the mouth of the Fos river, about a mile northward of Obrestadbrekke, has a depth of 4 fathoms in a basin about three-quarters of a cable square ; but the bar at the entrance has only 9 feet over it, and must not be attempted without the assistance of a local pilot. Raunen is a small islet at the end of a spit running out from the mainland, about a mile northward of Seilvaag ; there is anchorage to the"], [99, "CHAP. III.] 81 DANGERS \u2014 STAVANGER. north-eastward of the islet in 5 fathoms over sand. About one cable N.N.W. from Rauna is a rock named Lyren, which is always awash. BANK. \u2014 From about 1^ miles westward of Obrestadbrekke, a bank extends 13 miles to the northward, its outer edge running nearly parallel with the shore, at a distance of 2 to 3 miles from it, to J\u00e6derens Rev, whence it gradually takes a more westerly direction. The north-western extreme is about 8 miles N.N.W. from J\u00e6derens Rev, and 6 miles N.N.W. from Lille Feisten ; and from this point it runs straight in towards Tangerhaug. The depth at the outer edge of the bank is from 20 to 30 fathoms ; from thence the ground declines abruptly to seaward, and rises gradually towards the mainland. The bottom consists of sand, interspersed with rocky patches. ANCHORAGE OFF THE COAST\u2014 Should a vessel get so near the coast in thick weather that she cannot possibly regain an offing, she might possibly be saved by dropping her anchors on the bank ; this expedient should of course only be attempted in cases of extreme necessity, as the sea is naturally very heavy with on shore winds ; still with good anchors and long cables it might be possible to ride for a considerable time. If to the southward of J\u00e6derens Rev, the best place to ride \"out a gale is between Obrestadbrekke and Vig, where the bottom rises gradually towards the shore, carries 14 to 6 fathoms, and is tolerably clear of rocks. The only place between Vig and J\u00e6derens Rev, where the bottom is not foul, is abreast of Orre church. STAVANGER* t is one ofthe most ancient towns in Norway, and was a Bishop's see for nearly 600 years. The cathedral is one of the most interesting medi\u00e6val buildings in the country. In 1684 the principal part of the town was destroyed by fire and its importance diminished from that time to the beginning of the present century ; during the last sixty years, however, its commercial prosperity has increased steadily, the population at the present time numbering 18,000, while in 1814 it was only 2,500. Stavanger is the head-quarters of the extensive herring fisheries on this part of the coast, and was formerly entirely dependent on them for its maritime importance ; of late years, however, these fisheries have greatly deteriorated, and shipbuilding is now the principal branch of industry. In 1873 the tonnage of vessels belonging to the port was between 36 and 37,000 commerce lasts, or about 73,000 tons, constituting it the first maritime city in Norway. Stavanger carries on a considerable trade with the Baltic and also with France. Repairs both * See plan of Port Stavanger, on Admiralty chart, No. 2,281. f Chr.

[chap, in- of vessels and machinery can be readily accomplished here, and supplies of all sorts are abundant. An English Vice-consul is resident. The town stands at the head of By Fiord, and has a good and spacious harbour which is divided into two parts by Skandse point. Stavanger Vaag the western part of the harbour, has a depth of 11 to 14 fathoms between the quay and the custom house, decreasing to 8 and 4 fathoms farther in ; this anchorage is generally used by steamers and large vessels, which may if necessary, lie alongside the quay in 5^- fathoms. In the eastern anchorage south of Solyst and Gr\u00e6sholm, there are 13 to 5 fathoms, over rubble and mud. A mooring buoy has been placed 2\\ cables north of Tyveholm, for the convenience of large vessels beating in ; and from Kalhammeren to the town there are mooring rings and warping posts on both sides of the channel ; there is also a mooring buoy to the eastward of Sandvig, 1\\ cables north of Skandse point. Vessels of war may anchor north of Skandse point ; but Dusevig, a capacious bay about 2 miles north of the town, is preferable.

LIGHTS. \u2014 Fladholm. \u2014 From Fladholm, 6 miles northward of Lille Feisten, is exhibited a fixed white light, elevated 43 feet, and visible 8 miles between the bearings of S.W. by W. through south and east to N.N.E. | E. Tungen\u00e6s. \u2014 From a small wooden building on Tungen\u00e6s, about 7 miles northward of Fladholm, is exhibited a white light, elevated 29 feet, and visible 8 miles, when bearing from E. by N. \\ N. through south and west to within one cable southward of the south-west point of Bru. This light is shown from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Hvidingso, the largest of the islands off the north end of J\u00e6deren lies on the south side of the entrance to Skudesn\u00e6s fiord. On the south side of the island, about 6 miles north-westward of Tungen\u00e6s, stands a hexangular white stone tower with red roof, 88 feet high, which exhibits from an elevation of 149 feet a fixed white light, varied by a flash every four minutes, visible 19 miles in all directions. The flashes are preceded and followed by short eclipses of 25 seconds' duration, but beyond 16 miles nothing is seen but the flashes, and the light then appears to be revolving. Fjeldo. \u2014 From Fjeldo, 3\\ miles northward of Tungen\u00e6s, a fixed white light, visible 8 miles, is shown at an elevation of 56 feet, from the 15th' of July to the 15th of May. The south-east limit of Fjeldo light falls westward of Nordgrund, Kolsbo, and Gryden.

FROM THE SOUTHWARD\u2014 Vessels coming from the south- ward may stand in between Lille Feisten and Sorskod, the southernmost islet of the group off the north end of J\u00e6deren ; this is an easy passage in clear weather. PILOTS live on Roto, and are also on the look-out on Storkior and Heglan. DANGERS. \u2014 In addition to the dangers already described (page 79), there are numerous rocks and shoals amongst the islands northward of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s ; of these dangers the following lie nearest the fairway. Sorbo, carrying 9 feet, lies 2 cables E. \\ N. from Sorskod ; a 5 fathom patch lies 61 cables E. \\ N. from the same islet ; and at three quarters of a mile E. by N. \\ N. from Sorskod is an 8-fathom patch named Klakken. Midtfiera, a shoal on which there is a sunken rock carrying 8 feet, lies 6\\ cables N.N.W. \\ W. from Fladholm, and is marked by a red buoy with a black staff and oval iron cage. Tananger. \u2014 Shoals extend about 2 cables from the mainland at Tananger. Sandeflue, 4 cables N.N.E. from Kjerten, carries 3 fathoms. Dalshaugflue, a 2-fathom patch lying three-quarters of a mile west ward of South Vistn\u00e6stang, is marked by a staff aud broom. Borneflue, carrying 2 fathoms, lies about 7 cables N.W. J W. from North Vistn\u00e6stang. Boskind is a shoal extending half a mile .westward from the land at Bo ; the outer extremity, over which there are 7 feet, is marked by a staff and broom. Skodholmgrund is a 3-fathom shoal extending 1^ cables from the land west of Tungen\u00e6s lighthouse. South Tungeflue, a sunken rock carrying 7 feet, is marked by a staff and broom ; a shoal extends from this rock \\\\ cables to the south westward. Bragen, a rock above water, lying 4 cables N. by W. f W. from Tungen\u00e6s, is marked by an iron pillar ; a shoal extends from Bragen, half a cable to the westward, and a quarter of a cable in every other direction. TarebO, a sunken rock on the northern part of a shoal extending one cable from Tungen\u00e6s towards Bragen, carries 4 feet and is marked by an iron pole ; a 4-fathom shoal extends half a cable beyond Tarebo to the northward. North Tungeflue, carrying 7 fathoms, lies 3\\ cables N.W. f N. from Bragen. f 2"], [102, "84 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [CHAP. III. Kolsbo is a broad shoal half a mile northward of Fladskjer, off the north end of Bru island ; on the south end of this shoal there are several rocks, which are always awash, and on one of these an iron pillar has been placed. Nordgrund carries 3J fathoms and lies N. f W. 3 cables from the Western Kolsbo rock. Gryden, 1\u00a3 cables S.W. i W. from Fladskjer, is always awash, and is marked by an iron pillar. Ranneberg galten, the south extreme of a shoal extending from Tungen\u00e6s to the point north of Ranneberg bight, a distance of about one mile, is marked by a staff and broom ; this shoal extends generally about 1 J cables from the shore, and in some places carries only 2 feet. Ranneberg grund, a broad shoal carrying 2 feet, extends about one cable from the point south of Ranneberg bight ; the outer edge is marked by two staff and broom beacons. Fladskjer. \u2014 A shoal extends 11/ cables N.N.W. from Fladskjer, a small rock west of Brukjeo ; there are two rocky heads on this shoal which are nearly always awash. Nyhavn. \u2014 At the entrance to Stavanger harbour, on the east side is a shoal extending ]^ cables W.S.W. from the point north of Nyhavn (HundvaagS) opposite Kalhammeren ; the western extreme of this shoal is marked by an iron pillar. Tyveholmsten, half a cable north of Tyveholm, carries 14 feet, and is marked by a red iron pillar. Majorgrund, which extends one cable north of Majoren, carries 17 feet, and is also marked by an iron pillar. Plenting-grund, extending half a cable S.S.W. from Plentingen carries 2 fathoms, and has a red iron pillar on it. Perholmgrund is marked by a staff and broom. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 To pass northward of Skaademedgrund and Krogen and between Lille Feisten and Sorskod, keep Ullenshaug to the northward of Vigdeldsn\u00e6s, until Kjerten is well eastward of Roto ; the vessel will then be eastward of Klakken, and course must be altered to pass westward of the Var islets, and between Roto and Fladholm. Leave Midtfiera on either hand; pass eastward of Oxefodskjer and Kjerten, taking care to keep Osa, the westernmost of the Var islets, open west ward of Fladholm, in order to] clear the shoals off Tananger ; and when past Fjorn\u00e6s, keep the east point of Roto well to the eastward of Kjerten, in order to clear Dalshaugflue and Bjorneflue. Give Vistn\u00e6s a berth of about 2 cables : leave Boskind beacon on the starboard hand, and steer direct for Bragen ; pass about one cable southward of the latter rock in order to clear the 4-fathom patch north of Tarebo, and proceed for the"], [103, "85 CHAP. III.] DANGERS \u2014 DIRECTIONS. entrance to By Fiord. When past the beacons on Ranneberg shoals, steer for the entrance of the harbour, keeping nearest the mainland when passing Hundvaago, and bring up according to circumstances. Vessels from the southward may also stand in between Kjor and Skod holm, and pass southward of Roto. (See directions for Tananger, page 89.) HAASTENS FIORD, between Store Haasten and the Hvidingso group, is the best approach to Stavanger from the south-westward. COAST. \u2014 When approaching the Hvidingso group from the west ward, the coast presents a great variety of elevation, and may be easily recognised. Landmarks. \u2014 About due east of Hvidingso a remarkable cleft known as B\u00e6remskj\u00e6ften will be seen on the mainland between two lofty mountains with steep sides ; this is a very important and conspicuous mark. Reineknuten, the southernmost of the mountains forming this cleft, rises to a height of 2,556 feet. SnorSgrundene are three 5-fathom shoals lying about N. by W., distant IA miles from .Store Haasten. South Villebo, a shoal carrying 9 feet, lies 6 cables N.W. by N. \u00a3 N. from Hugen, an islet 1 h_ miles north-eastward of Store Haasten ; and North Villebo, carrying 8 feet, lies about one mile N.N.W. from the same islet. A group of rocks and shoals carrying from 6 feet to 7 fathoms extends about a mile northward from Egerholm and the Gronning islets. Haaboen, a small round rock on the north side of the entrance to Haastens Fiord, is marked by an iron pillar ; a shoal with 2 fathoms over its southern extremity, extends one cable S.S.W. from this rock. Hilleboen, on which the sea generally breaks, carries 5 feet, and lies about half way between Haaboen and Rodholmskod. Alsten shoals. \u2014 The south Alstenflue carries 5 fathoms and lies 1^ miles S.W. by W. f W. from Alsten islet ; the north Alstenflue has 6 fathoms over it, and lies one mile from Alsten on the same bearing. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When standing in for the entrance of Haastens Fiord, keep southward of the Hvidingso group until the cone-shaped mountain on West Bukn is in line with the westernmost of the group, or East Bukn is in line with Hvidingso lighthouse and Store Haasten bears E.S.E. ; Mostervarden, will then be in line with Alsten islet, which stands by itself in the middle of the fairway, and rises to a considerable height. Mostervarden, iu line with the cleft in Alsten will lead between Haaboen and the north Villebo, and when Asko church is in line with the north extreme of Tungen\u00e6s, keep it so until Mostervarden is in line with"], [104, "86 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [chap. hi. Bragen, then steer direct for the latter rock, and proceed as before directed (page 84). To pass northward of Bragen, proceed according to the above directions until Hvidingso church is in line with the north point of Jerholm, (an islet which may be recognised by a small stone cairn on the south extreme) ; then steer direct for Mostervarden until Hodne mountain on Renneso is seen between Bragen and Fladskjer, or well open north of Bragen, and this mark will lead in between the latter rock and the north Tungeflue. HVIDINGSO FIORD, or, as it is sometimes termed, Kvidso Fiord, between Eime islands and Fieldo, is the entrance to Stavanger from Skudesn\u00e6s Fiord and Karmsund. The west side of the entrance is marked by a stone beacon, which stands on one of the Svend rocks, a dangerous cluster lying about half a mile north-eastward of Eime. After passing eastward of the Svend rocks, giving them a good berth, steer for the eastern extreme of Tungen\u00e6s, and proceed as before directed. At night. \u2014 Having entered Skudesn\u00e6s Fiord at night, care must be taken not to bring Fjeldo light to bear eastward of S.E. by E., in order to avoid the Svend rocks. After closing Fjeldo light on a south-easterly bearing, vessels may haul to the southward when Tungen\u00e6s light bears westward of S. by E., and proceed for the entrance to By Fiord. Turning through. \u2014 When standing to the eastward, in turning through Hvidingso Fiord, the west slope of the mountain on Bru island, which descends almost perpendicularly to the sea, must be kept open eastward of Fluarholm, the outermost islet off Fieldo lighthouse, in order to avoid the shoals off the west side of Fieldo. In making the western board, East Bukn mountain must be kept well open east of Svend rocks, in order to clear Terne rocks and Stakken, which latter carries 2 feet and lies about three-quarters of a mile S.E. from Gr\u00e6sskjer. Fields lighthouse, kept halfway between the East and West Bukn mountains, is the best guide for going about when standing to the eastward in the vicinity of Gryden, Kolsbo, and the Nordgrund ; when past Tungen\u00e6s, care must be taken to avoid Ranneberg shoals and Fladskjer. The west side of Bru island should not be approached nearer than 2 cables. EASTERN ENTRANCE\u2014 With southerly and south-easterly winds, vessels may stand to the eastward into Horge Fiord, where there is more room for turning to windward. After passing Fladskjer give the south side of Brukjeo a berth of about one cable, and proceed through Omo Fiord, taking care when standing to the southward not to approach Gr\u00e6sholm, on the north side of Hundvaago, nearer than 1 cables. There are passages leading north and south of Spov islets, and be tween KlSvning and Spolen into Horge Fiord. A shoal extends one-third"], [105, "CHAP. III.] HVIDINGSO FIORD \u2014 HAASTEN. 87 of a cable from the north side of Spov islet, and there is shoal water round the Vaag islets, and about three-quarters of a cable eastward of them. Galten, a rock above water, lies a short cable from the south side of OmS, about half a mile eastward of Vaag islets. A shoal extends from Hillekjeo 1^ cables to the south-eastward, and 1^ cables to the west ward. Lyresten, a broad patch between HillekjeS and Omo, carries only 3 feet ; and a shoal extends H cables from the south-east point of Omo. Should it be necessary to stand into Hille Fiord, Jaatenuten (a hill bearing about S.S.W., distant 4 miles from Stavanger), in line with the west point of Klovningen, will lead between Lyresten and the shoals off OmS ; and the north point of Pr\u00e6stholm, in line with the east point of TalgS, leads between Lyresten and the shoal off HillekjeS. The shoal between Kupholm and Kupholmskjer extends one-third of a cable northward from the former, but the south Spov islet is steep-to. When steering for the channel between KlSvning and Spolen, give the north point of SandS a berth of at least half a cable, and keep nearest to Klovning, in order to avoid the shoal between Kupholm and Spolen, which extends half a cable southward of the former islet, and three-quarters of a cable S.S.W. from the latter. When turning through Horge Fiord, give the islets between KlSvning and VadsS a good berth, as there are numerous shoals between them. A 2-fathom shoal extends half a cable from the east side of Horge, and there are only 3 fathoms over a spit, extending one-third of a cable from the south point of that island ; the west side is steep-to. A shoal extends two-thirds of a cable N.N.E. and S.S.W. from Revingen. Jaatenuten, open south of Ramsvigodde, leads southward of Revingen, and through Lindosund, clear of the shoals which extend about half a cable from the north point of LindS, and the south point of VadsS Kalven. When past the latter island, course may be shaped for the eastern entrance to Stavanger south of Gr\u00e6sholm, from which a shoal extends two-thirds of a cable E.S.E. HARBOURS IN THE APPROACHES TO STA VANGER. \u2014 There are several harbours in the approaches to Stavan ger that may be taken when strong contrary winds are encountered, or when vessels, having been set too near the coast, are unable to gain an offing. HAASTEN. \u2014 There is anchorage south of Store Haasten in 9 to 12 fathoms, over sand. The western entrance is between Store Haasten and Goaskjer. After passing northward of Faxen, a rock lying W. by S. A S. distant 3 cables from the west point of Store Haasten, give the latter point a berth of one-third of a cable, and keep one-third over from the north side"], [106, "88 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [CHAP. III. of the channel, in order to avoid two rocks carrying 9 feet, which lie half a cable N.N.W. and North from Goaskjer. Care must be taken to keep southward of a line joining the south-west point of Store Haasten and Haastenholm (the islet on the north side of the channel) in order to avoid a rock carrying 9 feet, which lies half-way between them. When Hatten is in line with HuS, steer for the anchorage with Aales kjer open south of Frosholm ; give the north point of Odraskjer, the islet on the west side of the entrance to the anchorage, a berth of half a cable then steer either for the south point of BuS, or the east point of Kv\u00e6rn holm ; and bring up when Troldholm is visible through Staabolsund. Vessels of 8 feet draught may enter from the southward, keeping exactly in mid-channel between Seiskjer and the east point of Kv\u00e6rnholm, after passing close westward of Stangarholm. Rot6. \u2014 If necessary, vessels of 9 feet draught may anchor in 6 to 8 fathoms in the bight on the north-west side of RotS, but this anchorage should only be used in summer, as it is very unsafe, and is exposed to westerly gales ; in the inner bight there is 3 fathoms water, and safer an chorage. About W.N.W., distant 4 to 8 cables from Bronn\u00e6s, is a cluster of shoals carrying from 2 to 9 fathoms. SnodS hill, in line with Bronn\u00e6s, leads southward of them ; the same hill, in line with the north point of Roto, leads northward ; and a vessel will be eastward of these shoals when Lille Feisten is well open east of the Skod islets. When entering, give Bronn\u00e6s a fair berth ; and keep about a quarter of a cable from the land on the south side, when the vessel is within 2 cables of the entrance to the inner anchorage. Fladholm. \u2014 During summer, vessels detained by wind or tide may bring up in the roadstead between Fladholm and Staholm, from whence it is easy to get under weigh on either side ; but at a more advanced season of the year it would be advisable to put into Tananger. The best anchorage is in 7 to 10 fathoms opposite the mooring ring on the east side of Fladholm, with SnSdS hill touching the south point of Staholm. The north entrance is between Fladholm and a shoal extending 11 cables northward from Staholm. Small vessels may take the southern entrance between Johnsholm and the Gjoringen islets. Fiordbo, a rock above water, lies about 1^ cables south ofthe anchorage; Vigdeldsn\u00e6s, in line with the east point of GjSringen, leads westward of Fiordbo. TANANGER and RISEVIG.\u2014 Tananger Havn, a small but well sheltered harbour three-quarters of a mile north-east from Fladholm, has a depth of 9 to 7 fathoms, shoaling to the northward, over sand and clay ; and is provided with mooring posts and rings. Vessels may enter with the wind from S.E. through by south, and west to N.W. and in fine"], [107, "89 CHAP. III.] ROTO \u2014 HAFSPIORD. weather it is easy to get away with all winds, there being nothing to prevent beating out. The best berth is on the west side of the har bour, where there is more shelter from the sea thrown in by westerly winds. Vessels of war generally anchor in Risevig, an extensive bay immediately south of Tananger Havn, which has 9 to 15 fathoms, over clay and sand. The best berth is off Hammer Point in 9 fathoms, with Store Haasten in line with the south point of Melingholm. Southerly or easterly winds are required for leaving Risevig, and strong north-west winds send in a considerable swell. A bank projects about one cable from the northern shore, and a rock with 2 feet over it lies 1\u00a3 cables from the eastern shore at Ura. If approaching from the southward, proceed according to the directions given for Stavanger (page 84), until Fladholm lighthouse is abeam, when the south point of Kior, open north of Fladholm, will lead clear of Staholm shoal, and a shoal extending a short cable northward from Laxholm. To enter between KiSr and Skodholm, keep Kjerten in line with BrSnn\u00e6s, until Sole church is open north of Osa, the westernmost of the Var islets ; then steer so as to pass 2 cables southward of RotS and Nevling rocks, and take care to keep HuS open south of Roto, until Kjerten is visible east of the latter island ; the vessel will then be eastward of E\u00e6khansen, which carries one fathom and lies If cables E. by S. | S. from the south point of RotS, and may haul to the northward. When entering from the westward, bring Tanangerhaug in line with Aaleskjer; pass northward of the latter rock and Midtfiera, and proceed for the anchorage. Vessels may also stand in with Hodne mountain on Renneso in line with Komelen (which will lead westward of the shoals off Huo), and keep these marks on until Tanangerhaug is in line with Aaleskjer. At night. \u2014 After passing Fladholm at night, keep within the north eastern limit of the light, which falls one quarter of a cable northward of Staholm shoal, until about 3 cables from the land on the north side of the entrance to Tananger Havn, when course may be altered either for that anchorage or Risevig. Hafsflord. \u2014 There is tolerable anchorage northward of PrestSskjer, an islet inside the entrance to Hafsflord, in 8 to 5 fathoms. After passing Tananger, give Fjorn\u00e6s holm a berth of at least 2 cables, and keep in mid-channel when entering the fiord. There are only 7 feet in the channel south of PrestS, but on the east side is a narrow passage with 9 feet in it at high water ; Hammer point, open north of PrestS, will lead through clear of the rocks on either side."], [108, "90 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [CHAP. III. Visteholm. \u2014 Vessels detained by calms or currents will find tem porary anchorage eastward of Visteholm, one mile north-east of the entrance to Hafsfiord, in 4 to 6 fathoms. There are passages on either side of Visteholm, but care must be taken to avoid a broad shoal extending 2 cables from the shore at Rodsten. Sandvig, a spacious bay three-quarters of a mile south-westward of Tungen\u00e6s, has a depth of 5 fathoms, over a clean sandy bottom. After passing Boskind shoals, keep Mostervarden in line with Tungen\u00e6s until Hvidingso lighthouse touches the south point of Alsten ; the latter mark will lead northward of the shoals on the south side of the entrance. Bragen. \u2014 While waiting tide during calms or light winds, vessels may bring up in the roadstead between Bragen and Tungen\u00e6s in 10 fathoms, with the north point of Brukjeo in line with Tungen\u00e6s light-house, and Fieldo lighthouse in line with Bragen. KLOSTERHAVN, a good and well sheltered anchorage between Mostero and Fieldo, is provided with mooring rings, and has a depth of 5 fathoms, over clay and sand. A shoal extends one cable southward from M\u00e6le, an islet in the middle of the harbour, and northward of this islet is an extensive bank on which the average depth is less than one fathom. Segleim house on Renneso, seen between Ringeskjer and the houses on the west side of the bridge connecting Klostero and Mostero, will lead between Store Svarthove and Langebo (a broad shoal on the west side of the entrance) ; and Ravnefield on Klostero, in line with Skibnes, leads in between Store Svarthove and a shoal off the southwest point of Lamholm ; keep in mid-channel between the latter islet and Ringeskjer, and bring up either north-east of Lamholm, or east of Skibnes. RANNEBERG BIGHT, one mile south-eastward of Tungen\u00e6s, has good anchorage in 7 fathoms, shoaling to the westward, over sand and clay. The best position is with Mostervarden in line with the north point of Bruholm, and the cairn on Eime in line with Ranneberg-galten. There is a red buoy in the middle of the bight, and the shoals north and south of the entrance are marked by staff and broom beacons. KJEO. \u2014 Northward of Kjeo and Persholm, on the east side of By fiord, is a very good anchorage, which may be left with all winds. The best entrance is between Fladskjer and Persholm. Vessels should bring up in 10 fathoms, with Hvidingso church in line with Haan\u00e6s, and Dalsnuten, a hill 5 miles south of Stavanger, touching the west point of Kjeo. A shoal extends nearly 2 cables N.E., and two-thirds of a cable S.E. and East from Kjeo. The south Raune shoal, a broad patch 2\\ cables northward of Fladskjer, carries 7 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom."], [109, "CHAP. III.] VISTEHOLM\u2014 RISO HAVN. 91 Rauiievig. \u2014 After passing between Fladskjer and Govsholm, and eastward ofthe south Raune shoal, small vessels will find temporary anchor age in Raunevig, between Bru and Line, in 6 fathoms. The north Raune shoal, carrying 9 feet, lies I1 cables W. by N. from the north-west point of Line ; and a shoal with 2 fathoms over it extends three-quarters of a cable westward from the same point. Asko church, in line with the east point of Bru, will lead westward of these shoals, and the same church, in line with the west point of North Kupholm, leads between them. DUSEVIG. \u2014 The best anchorage for vessels of war is with West Bukn mountain in line with Grodeim Hammer point, and Rogvig house, bearing W. | N., in 1 2 fathoms, over sand ; in the south part of the bay there is less water, and the bottom is rocky. HVIDINGS ISLANDS.\u2014 The Hvidingso group lies about half way between Tungen\u00e6s and Karmo ; it consists of a number of low islands, on the largest of which stands the lighthouse. There are several anchorages amongst these islands, where vessels may seek shelter in cases of necessity. Haalandsvig, on the north side of Hvidingso, has a depth of 7to^l0 fathoms, over sand,jhut can only be left with southerly winds ; the entrance between Tondeskjer and Notskjer is narrow, and should not be attempted without a pilot for fear of damaging the submarine telegraph cable. There are mooring posts and rings here, and vessels should be steadied by shore hawsers. Kalven\u00e6sgrund, 1^ cables eastward of Kalven\u00e6s, has 12 fathoms over it, but breaks occasionally during heavy gales. Ystebo Havn, between Kalholm, R6s5, Gronningen, and Bladholm, has a depth of 6| fathoms, over sand and clay, and is provided with mooring rings ; but the approaches are narrow and intricate, and should not be attempted without a pilot. The northern entrance, through Ryving Sund, is available for vessels of 15 feet draught ; Saggaskjer Sund, the south western entrance, is available for vessels of 14 feet draught ; but the south eastern entrance, through Varholmsund, can only be taken by vessels drawing less than 1 1 feet. Two stone beacons, of unequal size, stand on Varholm, the islet on the east side of the entrance to the latter channel. RiSO Havn, between Riso, South Helleskjer, Gr\u00e6sskjer, and Thor holm, has anchorage for two large vessels, in 7 fathoms, over sand. This harbour is well sheltered from the sea, but is very narrow, and the tide runs through with considerable velocity, the flood stream setting eastward, and the ebb westward. The north-western entrance is between Saltskjer and Sjobiden, and the south-eastern entrance between Varholm and Hesteskj er ; both these channels may be used by vessels of 20 feet draught, but neither"], [110, "92 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [CHAP. III. should be attempted without a pilot. When entering the harbour during heavy weather, shore hawsers and a second anchor should always be in readiness. Lyngskjerflaket, a patch of clean ground between Lyngskjer. West Langholm, and Uglo, is a good and well sheltered anchorage, more suitable to large vessels than Riso Havn ; there are mooring rings on Uglo and Lyngskjer, and the depth is 10 fathoms, over clay and sand. The entrance is between the Huggene islets and Sandholm. When entering, give the south point of Sandholm a berth of one cable ; keep close to the west side of Varholm, and proceed for the anchorage. There is also a passage between Pigskjer and Helleskjer. Hesteskjervig, betwee East Buo and Stokken, has a depth of 7 fathoms ; the bottom, which is composed of sand, affords good holding ground, and rises gradually from the centre of the anchorage in every direction, but there are no mooring rings. The entrance is between South Hesteskjer and Stokken. KROGO HAVN, between Krogo and Krydso, has a depth of 8 to 12 fathoms, over sand, and is the best harbour in the Hvidingso group for large vessels, as it is well sheltered and spacious, and may be left with nearly all winds. There is a mooring ring on each side of the anchorage, and a warping post at the entrance. From the southward.\u2014 Mostervarden, in line with the cleft in Alsten, will lead into Haastens fiord, and when east of Haaboen, steer for the south point of Jerholm until well past Leiaboen ; then haul to the north ward, giving the north point of South Huggene a berth of at least 2 cables ; and bring Hviding house on Krydso in line with the west point of Vardbolm, an islet between the south points of Lango and Hestholm. Keep the latter mark on until within one cable of Vardholm ; give the south point of that islet a good berth, and proceed for the anchorage, taking care to keep close in to the east side of Lango when passing Skarveskjer, in order to avoid a rock carrying 4 feet, which lies nearly in mid-channel. After passing Leiaboen and the south point of Jerholm, vessels may brine the latter point in line with Store Haasten, and proceed with these marks on until Hvidingso church is in line with the south point of Stevelsholm, the islet immediately south of Krydso ; the latter marks will lead through the eastern entrance clear of the shoals off Hestholm and Krogo. If eastward of Jerholm, the north points of Gaasholm and Alsten in line will lead through Jerholm sund, between Jerholm and Busholm. From the northward.\u2014 Store Haasten, in line with the south point of Jerholm, will lead between Sando and Krogo ; when past the"], [111, "93 CHAP. III.] KROGO HAVN \u2014 LYSE FIORD. latter island haul up for the eastern entrance, and proceed as directed above. Ystebdstrand is a small bight close to the lighthouse. The south eastern entrance, through Stromsund, can only be taken by vessels drawing 7 feet at the outside ; those of greater draught must enter through Ryving sund, and take the channel between Gronningen and Roso. FIORDS EASTWARD OF STAVANGER AND SKUDESN\u00c6S. The fiords eastward of Stavanger and Skudesn\u00e6s form a deep bay, with numerous branches extending inland in different directions. The south side of this bay is studded with thickly wooded islands, some of which are of considerable size, and northward of these a broad deep chan nel, formed by the Buckne and Neerstrand fiords, extends 26 miles E.N.E. from Skudesn\u00e6s fiord. The inner branches extend through lake and mountain districts abounding with game, and their various tributary streams afford good fishing ; the scenery also is almost equal to that on the Hardanger fiord. These fiords, which are termed collectively Stavanger Fiord, are only briefly described here, as they are out of the regular coasters' track, and good pilots for them can be obtained at Stavan ger. GandS Fiord extends about 7 miles in a S.S.W. direction from Stavanger, and has anchorage at Hindal, Gauselholm, and Sandn\u00e6s. Sandn\u00e6s, which has 1,200 inhabitants, is a curiously built town consisting of a single long street ; there are several rope walks here, and two large potteries. Riske Fiord, eastward of the entrance to Gandsfiord, has anchorage on either side of the spit at Vaagen ; and on the north side of Usko, between that island and Uskosnekke, is a small bight with a depth of 2 fathoms. H6gS Fiord. \u2014 At the south end of Horge Fiord, between the main land and Idso, is the entrance to Hogsfiord, which extends from thence 12 miles to the south-eastward ; in this fiord are the following anchorages, viz., Vier, Bredvig, Dreggevig, Vedholm, Vaagen, and Ollesvig, on the west side, and Stenvig, Leranger bight, and Rossevig on the east side. On the west side of Hogsfiord, about five miles from Idso, is the en trance to Holefiord, which has anchorage in Eskeland bight ; and also in the creek east of Furuholm. From the head of Hogsfiord a beautiful branch known as Frafiord extends about 2 miles to the eastward. Lyse Fiord extends about 20 miles north-eastward from Fossan, a cluster of houses on the east side of Hogsfiord seven miles from the"], [112, "94 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [cnAP. in. entrance ; this fiord is deep and clean, and has anchorages in 6 to 12 fathoms at Vige, a small bight on the south side about 3 miles from the entrance. Lysefiord is one of the most remarkable fiords in Norway ; nowhere much exceeding a mile in breadth, it extends between cliffs rising almost perpendicularly on each side to a height of 2 to 3,000 feet, and near the head of the fiord, on the south side, is a cavern which occasionally emits a noise like thunder, followed by a slight cloud of vapour; this curious natural phenomenon, which has given rise to numerous legends, is only witnessed after strong westerly gales, and is supposed to be caused by compression of the atmosphere. \\ Ids6 Fiord, between Idso and Strand, terminates in Svin\u00e6s bight, which has anchorage east of Faareholm, west of Odden\u00e6s, and at Tunge land; there is also anchorage at the head of Botnefiord, which extends 1 1 miles to the south-eastward from Svin\u00e6s bight. Mastra Fiord, between Renneso and Mostero, has from 12 to 40 fathoms in mid-channel, but there are several shoals along the west side. Finnesand bight, between Klostero and Mostero, has 1 2 fathoms shoaling to 2; and Vige bight, south-east of Renneso church, has a depth of 6 fathoms. Small vessels may anchor at the north end of the fiord in Reian\u00e6svaag ; and also in the bight south of Loder. Mastra fiord is a good channel for vessels bound from the northward to any of the fiords eastward and southward of Stavanger. When entering from Bukne fiord give Lammeholm a berth of 2 cables, keep in mid-channel when passing the north side of Klostero, and when past Omo proceed on either side of Hilleo for Horge fiord. Hille Fiord is a broad sheet of open water between Hilleo and Brimso. Vessels may pass between Sagholm and Kv\u00e6rn\u00e6s, keeping Ullenshaug exactly in line with the north point of Horge, and anchor at Thaag, on the east side of the fiord, in 7 fathoms, over clay. Kj\u00e6rringen and Fj\u00e6refiue are shoals about halfway between the east points of Hilleo and Brimso ; the south points of Pr\u00e6stholm and Spovholm in line will lead between these shoals, and Kupholm in line with the north point of Pr\u00e6st holm leads northward of them. BrimSO Fiord, between Brimso and Talgo, has anchorage in Ost bohavn, the western bight of Melingsvaag, and Gardsvaag. Hanesand sund, between Talgo and Renneso, is a continuation of Brimso Fiord. The east point of Pr\u00e6stholm touching Koveholm, leads eastward of the dangers off Renneso ; there is anchorage in the bight south of Hane sand between Hanesandholm and Renneso, and southward of Nedre Bo. TalgO Fiord, between Talgo, Finno, and Fogn, has several anchor ages, of which Kinestadvaag, on the south side of Finno, is the best."], [113, "95 CHAP. III.] IDSO FIORD \u2014 HERVIG FIORD. There are numerous summer residences on the latter island belonging to Stavanger families. Aardals Fiord, the entrance to which is between Fogn and the mainland, leads to the Aardals-elv, said to be a good salmon river ; and north-eastward of Fogn, between Rando and tho mainland, is Fister fiord. Finno Fiord. \u2014 From Talgo fiord vessels may pass through Finno fiord, on the east side of Finno, to Ombo fiord and Garsund. Ombd Fiord, between Ombo and the Stierne islands, a group lying north of Finno and west of Ombo, leads into the Neerstrand and Jelso fiords. Garsund, Hjelmeland Fiord, and Jelso Fiord.\u2014 Garsund, between Ombo and Rando, leads to Hjelmeland fiord, which extends between Ombo and Jossen\u00e6s, and opens out to the northward into Jelso fiord. Jossen Fiord and Er Fiord. \u2014 Jossen fiord is a continuation of Garsund, and extends about 20 miles eastward from N\u00e6svig, a small anchorage on the north side of the entrance. Er fiord extends E.S.E. 7 miles from Jelso fiord, and branches off north and south. Sands Fiord. \u2014 The entrance to which is between Hemn\u00e6s and Jelso, is the northernmost branch of Stavanger fiord, and leads to Suldals river and the Suldal, a valley which affords excellent sport, and is un doubtedly one of the finest hilly districts in western Norway. To the northward of Sand village, the fiord is divided into two branches, Saude or Sovde fiord, and Hylsfiord ; the former extends about 10 miles to the northward, and the latter nearly 14 miles to the eastward; both these branches are deep and clean, and have several anchorages. Vinde Fiord. \u2014 Between Hemn\u00e6s and Neerstrand is the entrance to Vindefiord, which has three branches extending north, east, and west from Kraaken\u00e6s and Hapn\u00e6s, of these branches Sandeid fiord is the con tinuation of Vinde fiord to the northward, and Yrke fiord is the western arm. Vats fiord is an inlet extending northward from Yrke fiord. There are numerous anchorages and villages in Vinde fiord, and a building yard at Hoggenvig, 1| miles south of Vikedal. Neerstrandsvaag, on the north side of Neerstrand fiord, is a very good harbour, with a depth of 8 to 9 fathoms. The entrance is between F\u00e6ro and Tungen\u00e6s. Shoals extend two-thirds of a cable northward from' the east point of F\u00e6ro, and three-quarters of a cable southward from the southernmost of the islets off the east end of Neerstrand. Besides this anchorage there are several others on the north side of Neerstrand fiord. Hervig Fiord. \u2014 Nine miles westward of Vinde fiord is the entrance to Hervig fiord, which has anchorage in Hervig, and also on the south side of Espevig Fleet, a large bay south-east of Borgo. Skjdlde fiord is a"], [114, "96 EKERSUND TO HVIDINGSO. [CHAP. III. continuation of Hervig fiord, but is not navigable beyond Strommen, a narrow channel with only 2 feet in it, about 3 mile3 north of Borgo. Falkeid Fleet and Foreland Fiord.\u2014 Falkeid Fleet is a large bay to the westward of Hervig fiord, and eastward of Ogneo and East Bukn. Frekasund, between Ognekalv and the mainland, leads from this bay to Karmsund and Foreland fiord, a narrow inlet which extends about 6 miles northward from Oster island, and has anchorage in Slottevig, Nakii, and Haugaasvig. Small vessels may anchor between Buk holm and Lang holm, south-east of Fulkeid Fleet, and there is also anchorage in Vaage havn, on the south side of East Bukn, in 5 fathoms. Bukne Sund, between East and West Bukn islands, has anchorage for small vessels in Foresvig, Kongshavn, and the bights west of Krog, whence vessels may pass to Karmsund. LIGHT. \u2014 On the east side of West Bukn, in the narrowest part of Bukne sund, a fixed white light, visible 4 miles, is shown from the 1st of October to the 31st of March. Knarholmgrund, a shoal extending one cable eastward from Knarholm, a small islet on the west side of the south entrance to Bukne sund, carries 2 feet, and is marked by an iron pole. When entering from the southward, leave Knarholmgrund on the port hand and keep exactly in mid-channel when passing the light, as shoals extend a short distance from the land on either side. F6re Fiord extends about 8 miles northward of Hovringo, the largest of a group of islands lying northward of the Bukn islands, and has anchor age in Hellevig, Roksund, and North Dyrn\u00e6svaag. Drevsundsflak, a large bay on the south side of West Bukn, where southward bound vessels sometimes anchor to wait for wind or tide, is full of islets and shoals, and the approaches to the different anchorages are intricate and narrow. The best entrance is through Dybesund, between Busholm and Lang holm. Keep Dagsland knoll in line with Haugneland houses, until northward of Sauo, and bring up in 15 to 12 fathoms, taking care not to drop the anchor on a 4-fathom patch of foul ground situated If cables east of the south point of Drevsundsholm. There is also anchorage between the east side of West Bukn and the Sol islets."], [115, "97 I CHAPTER IV. HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. Variation in 1880. Udsire 17\u00b0 10' W. COAST.* \u2014 Northward of Stavanger the characteristic features of the Norwegian coast begin gradually to appear ; the islands increase in size and number, and the mountains attain a greater elevation, but there are as yet no traces of the bold, striking outlines, and savage grandeur, which distinguishes the coast scenery northward of Throndhjem. The coast between Hvidingso and Espev\u00e6r, a fishing station on the north side of the entrance to Bommel fiord, is covered for about 16 miles by Karmo, a long narrow island, which is much lower than the mainland. There are several outlying clusters of islands on this reach, amongst which Udsire is a most important landmark. Northward and southward of Karmo are Bommel and Skudesn\u00e6s fiords, the entrances to which are conspicuous from the offing. Tides. \u2014 In fine settled weather the flood comes in direct from sea ward, between Hvidingso and Holmengraa, and the ebb retires straight off shore, but the strength and direction of the tidal streams is mainly dependent on the winds. Southward of Skudesn\u00e6s the rise is only from 2 to 3 feet, but increases steadily to the northward, and near Bergen is 4 or 5 feet. In the Inner Lead, and along the coast, the streams generally turn 3 hours before high and low water ; this is probably caused by the variation in the rise and fall, the surface of the water being horizontal at half tide, while at hio-h water there is a depression to the southward, and at low water to the northward. Generally speaking the flood sets northward, and the ebb southward, in the inner channels ; but here also the tides are greatly influenced by the weather, and sometimes run in one direction for days together, a slackening being observable during the time the opposite stream ought to be making. Althou\"h the rise is so slight, the tidal streams run with great velocity and diversity of direction through many of the narrower channels, and * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Norway, south-west coast, the Naze to Karmo, No. 2,281 ; and Norway, west coast, sheet I., Karmo to Bergen, No. 2,304. K 740. G"], [116, "98 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. IV. strict attention should be paid to these irregularities, especially when under sail. UDSIRE, the outermost of the islands between Hvidingso and Espev\u00e6r, lies about 8 miles westward of the north end of Karmo. In addition to its height, and isolated position, Udsire is distinguished by two circular stone lighthouses, which are painted red in order to serve as day marks. DANGERS. \u2014 Spanholin, an islet about one mile S.W. from Udsire, is rather lofty ; Lausungen, a long half mile southward of Spanholm, is low, but shows well above water. A patch with one fathom on it lies about half way between these islets ; a rock carrying 8 fathoms lies a short 3 cables N.N.E. from Spanholm ; and Skadet, a rock which also carries 8 fathoms, lies 6 cables S.E. from Lausungen. With these exceptions, the dangers off Udsire are close to the shore, and vessels may safely approach to within 2 or 3 cables, in order to obtain a pilot. PILOTS.* \u2014 Ten pilots are stationed on Udsire, and a good look out is kept for approaching vessels.- In heavy weather vessels should always run to leeward of the island to wait for a pilot. LIGHTS. \u2014 Udsire lighthouses stand on the west side of the island, 113 yards apart, and bear from each other N.W. J W., and S.E. | E. ; they are 39 and 46 feet high respectively, and each exhibits, at an elevation of 255 feet, a, fixed white light, visible 18 miles in all directions. Anchorage. \u2014 Nordvig Vaag, the inlet on the north side of Udsire, has a depth of 12 fathoms shoaling to 7, over good holding ground, but a considerable swell is felt there. If obliged to stand in without a pilot, open the valley, which stretches north and south between the two mountains, and steer direct for the harbour ; keep in mid-channel between the rocks on either side of the entrance (two of which are marked by warping piles with cages on the top), and when well inside, bring up in 10 or 12 fathoms, a short half cable from the western shore. Hawsers should be run out to the rings on shore directly the anchor is let go. Tuevaag, on the south side of Udsire, has a depth of 9 fathoms, shoaling to the northward ; vessels drawing 8, or at the outside 9 feet will find a snug berth inside the breakwater at the inner end of the bight, The entrances are narrow, but not difficult. To enter the inner anchorage vessels must pass eastward of Sk j onholm, which is marked by a warping post with a cage on the top. These harbours should only be used in cases of emergency, or in fine weather, and are not available for large vessels. * Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Black Eagle, 1870."], [117, "Chap, iv.] UDSIRE \u2014 SKUDESN\u00c6S FIORD. 99 ASPECT OF COAST.\u2014 When nearing the land between J\u00e6deren and Udsire, the entrance to Skudesn\u00e6s fiord will be very conspicuous. The cone shaped mountain on West Bukn, and Hvidingso lighthouse are also conspicuous landmarks ; when aprjroaching from the northward, Udsire will be unmistakeable. Karmo, as already observed, is much lower than the mainland. The islands on the south side of Stavanger fiord, and the mountains farther inland are very lofty. Ferkingstad islands, a small group 3 miles W.N.W. from Ferkingstadn\u00e6s, are frequented by fishermen during the summer, but they are uninhabited, and afford no anchorage. They are clean to within a distance of 2 cables all round. KARMO is about 16 miles long in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, and nearly 5 miles broad between Ferkingstadn\u00e6s and Tommervig, becoming much narrower towards the north end. The beach on the west side of Karmo, southward of Veavaag, is chiefly composed of white sand, consequently the detached rocks are very conspicuous, especially the Svorting and Ryvingen islets, which are quite black. The hills on the south-west side of Karmo present a very rugged outline, and when approaching from the westward, Skudesn\u00e6s lighthouse, a white wooden building 8 feet high, which stands about 70 feet above high water, will also be visible. SKUDESN\u00c6S FIORD, the northern entrance to Stavanger, is a deep opening between Hvidingso and Karmo, and takes its name from Skudesn\u00e6s, the south-eastern extreme of the latter island. Skudesn\u00e6s is about 5 miles N.N.W. from Hvidingso, and marks the entrance to Karm sund. Owing to the facility with which this inlet may be made out, both by day and night, vessels bound to Bergen frequently enter here, and proceed northward through Karmsund. PILOTS. \u2014 In order to obtain a pilot, vessels may stand close in to the northward and westward of Hvidingso, or the east side of Skudesn\u00e6s ; pilot boats generally cruise in the vicinity of the latter point. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, visible 11 miles between the bearings of N.E. by N., through north and west to S.W. \\ W., is shown from an elevation of 77 feet, at Skudesn\u00e6s. The south-western limit of the light falls one cable eastward of Ostboen (East rock). At night. \u2014 When entering Skudesn\u00e6s fiord at night, vessels bound to Stavanger may pass about 2 miles westward of Hvidingso light, and steer an easterly course until Fjeldo light bears about S.E. by E., when course may be altered for Kvidso fiord. If northward bound, give the south end of Karmo a berth of about 2 miles, and proceed according to the directions for Karmsund (page 107). G 2"], [118, "100 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. IV. SKUDESN\u00c6S HAVN, on the south side of Karmo, has anchorage northward of the big islets in 4 to 5 fathoms over sand, and farther in, between the houses and Steiningen, there are 3 fathoms. The former anchorage is available for vessels of 16 feet draught, but the latter can only be used by small craft; both are well sheltered, and provided with mooring rings. There is a yard here where vessels may be hove down and repaired. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed red light is shown, at 26 feet above high water, from a small building on the north Vigholm. The light is visible 6 miles, between the bearings of N. \u00a3 E., through weft to S. \\ E. ; its south western limit falls 11 cables eastward of Ostboen. The light is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. DANGERS. \u2014 Ostboen, which has only 6 feet over it, and lies 6 cables S. by W. from Skarveskjer, is the outermost of the dangers off Skudesn\u00e6s Havn. Vigholm lighthouse, bearing N. \\ E., leads eastward of all the dangers on the west side of the eastern entrance. There are two rocks, carrying 6 feet and 2| fathoms respectively, off the south point of north Vigholm, but they lie within 50 yards of the shore. The rocks round the foot of Skudesn\u00e6s extend about 1^ cables from the point. Eastern entrance. \u2014 The eastern entrance, between Skudesn\u00e6s and Vig islets, may be taken by vessels of 16 feet draught with the wind from W.S.W. through south to E.N.E. Keep on the south side of the narrow channel between North Vigholm and N\u00e6sodden, after passing the lighthouse, and bring up opposite Bagerholm, the nearest islet to the north end of Vigholm. At night, when approaching from the westward, keep well to the southward of Karmo till within the limits of Skudesn\u00e6s lisrht, then brin\u00bb Vigholm light to bear about N.N.W., and steer for it; give the south point of Vigholm a good berth, and proceed as directed above. The South-west entrance to Skudesn\u00e6s Havn, eastward of Gjeitung islets, is available for vessels of 14 feet draught, but is so intricate and foul that strangers ought not to attempt it without a pilot. In Bogen, a stopping-place on the north side of south Gjeitung islet, there are 6 fathoms. Vigholm and Tversund.\u2014 There are 4 fathoms in a bight on the north side of south Vigholm, which must be entered from the eastward, and Tversund is a small basin southward of Bagerholm ; these anchorages are only used by small coasters and fishing craft. Naley, immediately northward of Gjeitung islets, has a depth of 7 fathoms, and is a good summer anchorage for vessels of moderate size but southerly and westerly gales send in a heavy sea. With the assistance"], [119, "chap, iv.] SKUDESN\u00c6S HAVN \u2014 VEAVAAG. 101 of a pilot, Naley may be entered either from the south-eastward or west ward, but there are numerous dangers in both approaches, and the leading marks cannot well be made out by those unacquainted with the locality. In the bight at Syre, about three-quarters of a mile to the north-west ward of Naley, is a creek bordered by shallow ground, where vessels of 10 feet draught may lie in 3 fathoms. WEST COAST Of KARMO.\u2014 Immediately westward of Syre, on the south side of Karmo, is a very irregular cluster of hills known as Syre Glauna, and half a mile westward of these is an islet named Jarsten. From Syre Glauna, the west coast of Karmd trends generally, with numerous indentations and projections, in a N.N.E. direction to Ferkingstadn\u00e6s, a distance of 5 miles. There are no anchorages on this part of the coast, and the dangers are all within half a mile of the shore. Between Ferkingstadn\u00e6s and Helgen\u00e6s, a distance of about 8 miles, the coast is fronted by numerous islets and rocks, which extend about 2 miles off shore, and, when uncovered, are conspicuous from the offing against the white sandy beach. About one mile northward of Helgen\u00e6s is the southernmost of the F\u00e6 islands ; between this group and Osn\u00e6sgavlen, the north extreme of Karmo, is a labyrinth of small islets and rocks, amongst which no prudent seaman would attempt to navigate without a pilot; There are several anchorages between Helgen\u00e6s and Osn\u00e6sgavlen, but they are only used by small coasters aud fishing vessels, and none of the harbours on the west coast of Karmo are available for large vessels. Aakre and Man\u00e6s. \u2014 Aakre Havn, a small anchorage inside the islets off Aakre, 2 miles northward of Ferkingstadn\u00e6s, has a depth of 4 fathoms, and is available for vessels of 13 feet draught. Man\u00e6s Havn, 1^ miles northward of Aakre, has a depth of 3 fathoms, and may be used by vessels drawing 10 feet. There are several entrances to these harbours, but they are too foul and intricate to be attempted with out a pilot. Veavaag. \u2014 About lj miles north-eastward of Man\u00e6s, is the en trance to Veavaag, a long narrow frith extending over 2 miles in a south easterly direction, and only separated from Kobbervig, an inlet on the east side of Karmo, by a narrow neck of land. There is good anchorage for small craft at Ytterland, Sevig, and Sundvig. Munkejordbugt, on the south side of the inlet, one mile from the entrance, has a depth of 10 to 12 fathoms, over sand and clay ; and Brekkeosen, one mile farther in, has a depth of 8 fathoms westward of Skaarholm. All these anchorages are provided with mooring rings, and the two latter might be used by vessels of considerable size, but south-easterly winds are required for leaving. Vessels may enter between Lamholm, an islet in Vikesto bight, and"], [120, "102 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. IV. Kvittingskjer, a small rock three-quarters of a mile to the south-westward, and keep within one cable of the land on the north side until past Ytterland ; the passage then becomes very narrow, and a rock with 3 feet on it lies, nearly in mid-channel opposite Sund. Kvalevaag, one mile northward of Veavaag, has a depth of 5 fathoms, and is a very good anchorage for small craft. Vessels should keep close to the land on the north side when entering or leaving. Vikestobugt, is an anchorage between Kvalevaag and Staksodden, but as there are numerous small islets and rocks in the entrance, it is seldom used. Kalstobugt, between Staksodden and Helgen\u00e6s, has a depth of 12 fathoms, over good holding ground, and 7 mooring rings ; but being exposed to the north-west it cannot be recommended as an anchorage. Dalsvaag and Osn\u00e6svaag, on the west side of Osn\u00e6s, afford good anchorage for small craft in 4 to 5 fathoms. Gavlesund, the entrance to these anchorages from Karmsund, though very narrow, is easily made out, as Langflue, and the two rocks southward of the west Storoholm, are marked by staff and broom beacons. F\u00c6 ISLANDS.\u2014 This group, which lies about one mile westward of the north end of Karmo, and the same distance northward of Helgen\u00e6s, offers good shelter to vessels which may have approached too near the west coast of Karmo. LIGHT. \u2014 Faed. \u2014 A red stone tower stands on the south-east point of Sondre or south Vindkj\u00e6ftholm, on the west side of the entrance to F\u00e6o Havn. The light, which is shown from the 15th of July to the 15th of May, is fixed and white, with the exception of a red sector in the direction of, and half a cable on each side of Gangvarskjer ; it is elevated 41 feet, and is visible 9 miles in clear weather,' between the bearings of E. \\ N., through north and west to S.S.W. F\u00c6O HAVN, or, as it is sometimes called, Ostre or east F\u00e6o Havn, is a very good and safe anchorage, with a depth of 10 to 12 fathoms over good holding ground, but northerly winds are required for leaving. The best berth is westward of Trulsholm, where vessels may lie at single anchor with shore hawsers fast to the rings on Duo. Small vessels may haul into the inner bight, between F\u00e6o and Ulvo, and moor. On the east side of the anchorage is a small rock, named Skifteskjer, which lies in the middle of a shoal patch about halfway between Sandholm and Trulsholm. Vindkj\u00e6ftboen, a rock with 3 fathoms over it, lies nearly half a calbe eastward of the north Vindkj\u00e6ftholm the islet north of that on"], [121, "KVALEVAAG \u2014 KVALOSUND. 103 CHAP. IV.] which the lighthouse stands. The east points of the south Vindkj\u00e6ftholm and Gangvarskj\u00e6r in line will lead clear to the westward. Gangvarskjer, about 2\\ cables S.W. \\ S. from the south Vindkj\u00e6ft holm, marks the west side of the entrance to F\u00e6o Havn. A shoal extends half a cable S.S.E. from the east Svartskjer, a small rock lying nearly one cable S.W. from the lighthouse, and Varholmskolten, a rock carrying 6 fathoms, lies one cable southward of Varholm, the islet west of Sandholm. Vindkj\u00e6ftsund, the southern entrance to F\u00e6o Havn, is narrow, but not difficult. After passing about one cable eastward of Gangvarskjer, steer for the lighthouse, and keep close in to the north Vindkj\u00e6ftholm, in order to clear Vindkj\u00e6ftboen. Small vessels may pass westward of Gangvarskjer. and eastward of Soro, to the inner bight between F\u00e6o and Ulvo, but this channel is intricate. At night, vessels approaching from the westward should keep westward of or only just within the western limit of the sector of red light until Udsire lights bear southward of W.N.W., in order to avoid coming in upon the Ferkingstad islands or the shoals northward of Aakre ; they may then keep to the eastward, cross the red sector, and steer for the light directly it shows white again, passing close to the north Vindkj\u00e6ftholm as directed above. Tides. \u2014 The tidal; streams turn regularly at vhigh and low water in Vindkj\u00e6ftsund, the flood setting northward, and the ebb southward. Northern entrance. \u2014 Vessels of 7 feet draught may enter F\u00e6o Havn from the northward through Gittero Sund, between Gittero and Ulvo ; and there are two passages between the islets south of Gittero, available for vessels of 8 to 12 feet draught, but the tidal streams run very strongly in all these channels, and turn three hours before . high and low water. SanOSUnd or West F\u00e66 Havn, on the>outh-west side of F\u00e6o, has anchorage for small vessels in 5 to 10 fathoms, and may be entered either from the southward or westward, but south-westerly gales send in a heavy swell. The tidal streams turn three hours before high and low water in Sanosund, and often run very strongly. A shoal extends half a cable to the south-eastward from the south-east side of Lamholm ; and a rock carrying 2 fathoms lies 11 cables East of the south point of Lam holm, and about 60 fathoms from the west side of F\u00e6o. Kvalosund, between Kvalo and Ulvo, has good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught in 5 to 10 fathoms, and is clear of dangers with the exception of Rassenesflue, which carries 1^ fathoms, and lies one cable S.E. from the south point of Kvalo."], [122, "104 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R [chap. iv. COAST. \u2014 The coast between Karmo and Bommelo is fronted by a number of scattered islets and rocks. When standing in to the northward of Udsire, the Rov\u00e6r group will be easily distinguished, as the principal island is high, and has a stone beacon on the summit. The coast drops towards Bommel fiord, a conspicuous opening 2 miles broad, through which in clear weather the lofty Hardanger mountains will be visible, and the land in the vicinity of the entrance is rather low. Landmark. \u2014 Near the centre of Bommelo, in latitude 59\u00b045'N., longitude 5\u00b0 18' E., is situated Siggen mountain, which may be seen in clear weather from a distance of over 30 miles. It is 1,500 feet high, and resembles a pyramid with a rounded top and a broad base. Siggen will be seen before any other part of the island is visible, and is a most impor tant landmark. Urter islands. \u2014 This group lies about 4 miles E.N.E. from Udsire, and 3 miles westward of F\u00e6o. It is uninhabited, and has no anchorages. There are no dangers to the southward of these islands, but it is unadvi sable to pass northward of them on account of the vicinity of Svea rocks and other shoals. SVEA ROCKS, a dangerous cluster lying N. by W. nearly 2 miles from Urter islands, are nearly always indicated by breakers, and several of them show above water. ROV\u00c6R. \u2014 The Rov\u00e6r, Bjorkev\u00e6r, and Indrev\u00e6r islands lie between 3 and 4 miles north-eastward of Urter, and the southernmost of the group is only about one mile N.N.W. of F\u00e6 islands. Rov\u00e6r has three anchorages, but they are not so easy of access as F\u00e6o Havn. LIGHT. \u2014 Afixed white light is exhibited, at an elevation of 93 feet, from a small wooden building on Gittero, the easternmost of the Rov\u00e6r group. It is visible 6 miles, between the bearings of 8. | W. through west and north to N.E. by E. | E., and is shown from the Ist of October to the 31st of March. BEKKEVIG, on the south-east side of Rov\u00e6r, and between that island and Hillero, is a well sheltered harbour with a depth of 6 fathoms over good holding ground. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When approaching- from seaward, vessels may stand in between Svea rocks and Rov\u00e6r island, giving the south point of the latter a berth of nearly one mile ; when past Store Hat the southern most of the islets between Rov\u00e6r and Bjorkev\u00e6r, they may haul up for the anchorage, passing about 1-^ cables eastward of Bryggelands islets. The red house on the north side of Bekkevig, in line with the point on the west side of the entrance, will lead in between the shoals off Rov\u00e6r and Hillero."], [123, "CHAP. IV.] URTER ISLANDS \u2014 BOMMELBAAD. 105 Southern entrance. \u2014 If coming from the southward, give the F\u00e6 islands a berth of about one mile, keep nearly in mid-channel between Bjorkev\u00e6r and Indrev\u00e6r, and steer for the middle of Glette ; keep close t\u00ab the south side of the latter island, which i3 clean close-to, and steer about N.W. till the red house is in line with the west side of the entrance to the harbour. Northern entrance. \u2014 When coming from the northward, pass the northernmost of the Rov\u00e6r group at a prudent distance, and proceed through Gittero Sund. between Gittero and Ulvo. Keep in mid-channel between Fladholm and the south point of Ulvo, in order to avoid the shoals on either side ot the passage ; then steer to the northward of Brygge lands islets, and haul up for the anchorage as directed above. Small vessels may bring up in 9 fathoms to the north-eastward of Ankerholm, the small islet on the west side of Gittero, and moor with shore hawsers ; but it is impossible to lie there if the wind is at all fresh from the south-west. To enter between Gittero and Glaapene rocks, pass about half a mile eastward of the lighthouse, and give the Glaapene a fair berth, taking care not to approach the south side of Gittero within 1\u00a3 cables. Give Fladholm a berth of one cable, and steer northward of Bryggelands islets until the harbour leading marks are in line. The best entrance, however, from the northward and eastward, is between Glette and Bjorkev\u00e6r. Vessels may pass within half a cable of the Glaapene, and keep close to the south side of Glette, according to the foregoing directions. Suggevaag and Sandesund, two small anchorages on the north side of Rov\u00e6r, are only used by small fishing craft. ENTRANCES to BOMMEL FIORD\u2014 When approach- ing Bommel fiord from seaward, vessels may stand in either northward or southward of the outlying islets and rocks between Rov\u00e6r and Esp\u00e6ver, according to circumstances. Pilots may be obtained from all the inhabited islands on this part of the coast, but strangers will have no difficulty in entering Bommel fiord, as nearly all the dangers show themselves.* Bommelbaad, a small round rock 5 miles N. by E. from the Rov\u00e6r group, and about the same distance westward of the entrance to Bommel fiord, is the westernmost of the above-mentioned dangers, and shows well above water. A patch, with only 3 feet over it, lies 4 cables N.N.E. from Bommelbaad, and is nearly always indicated by breakers. Gaaseskallen, a 4-fathom patch lying 4 cables S.S.W. from Gaaseskjer (\"which lies 3^ miles N.E. from the northernmost of the Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey, H.JJ.S. Black Eagle, 1870."], [124, "106 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. iv. Rov\u00e6r group), is the southernmost of the dangers in the entrance to Bommel fiord. East Gunnarskjerflue.\u2014 The Rodholm cluster lies 11 miles W.S.W. from the south point of Bommelo, and Gunnarskjer is a small rock three-quarters of a mile N.N.W. | W. from Rodholm. East Gunnarskjer flue, a rock carrying 9 feet, lies a short cable S.E. from Gunnarskjer, and is the southernmost of the dangers off Espev\u00e6r. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 62 feet, and visible 8 miles, is exhibited from a lighthouse on Ryvardens point, The light is shown from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing .Udsire, vessels should give Svea rocks a berth of at least one mile ; Rov\u00e6r may be passed at a distance of 2 cables, and course should then be shaped to pass between Ramsholm and Oxoskjer, taking care to avoid Gaaseskallen. Storflue, carrying 6 fathoms, lies 3 cables W.S.W. from Seiskjer, the westernmost of the Ramsholm cluster, and a rock carrying 3 \u00a3 fathoms lies about three-quarters of a cabl% S.E. from the easternmost Oxoskjer. Vessels may also pass southward and eastward of Ramsholm, if con sidered advisable. At night. \u2014 After passing Ramsholm, Sorhaugo light must be kept in sight westward of the land south of Ryvardens until the vessel is past Little Bloksten, which lies about three-quarters of a mile northward of Ryvardens point. NORTHERN ENTRANCE. \u2014 The northern entrance to Bommel fiord, between Rodholm and Gunnarskjer, is known as Gunnarskjers hullet. During strong gales the sea sometimes breaks on Udnoringshausen, a shoal with 14 fathoms over it, which lies 9 cables N.E. \\ N. from Bom melbaad, therefore vessels taking this entrance generally pass about 1^ miles northward of Bommelbaad, and keep in mid-channel between Gunnarskjer and Rodholm. KARMSUND. \u2014 Having described the coast and outlying islands between Hvidingso and Espev\u00e6r it is necessary to return to the southern entrance to Karmsund, the narrow sound which separates Karmo from the mainland and West Bukn ; and which may be considered as the commence ment of the Inner Lead proper. PILOTS. \u2014 Strangers should not attempt Karmsund without a pilot, as the channel is narrow and the currents are very strong. Pilots may be obtained either from Hvidingso or Skudesn\u00e6s. Winds. \u2014 In Karmsund the wind invariably follows the direction of he channel, and is therefore either fair or dead foul."], [125, "CHAP. IV.] ENTRANCES TO BOMMEL FIORD. 107 Tides. \u2014 In the southern part of Karmsund, between Skudesn\u00e6s and Kobbervig, the current generally sets to the northward, but is more or less affected by the wind. From Kobbervig to the north end of the sound the tidal streams turn regularly three hours before high and low water, so that at high water the current attains its greatest velocity running to the southward, and at low water to the northward. Three days after full and change it is high water in Karmsund at 12h. Om., and the stream begins to set south ward at about 9h. Om., and northward at about 3h. Om. At Salhus, the narrowest part of Karmsund, the streams run with great velocity. LIGHTS. \u2014 Kobbervig. \u2014 On the north side of the entrance to Kobbervig, about 9 miles northward of Skudesn\u00e6s lighthouse, a fixed red harbour light, elevated 31 feet, and visible 3 miles between the bearings of N.W. i N., and W. by S. * S., is shown from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Hoievarde. \u2014 From a' red stone tower on Hoievarde, 2\\ miles north ward of Kobbervig, is exhibited a fixed white light, elevated 64 feet, and visible 8 miles between the bearings of S.E. f S. through south and west to N.E. byN.iN. DANGERS. \u2014 Most of the dangers in Karmsund are within one cable of the shore, and as they are all accurately laid down on the chart it is unnecessary to specify more than those mentioned in the following directions : \u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 About N.E. by N. 7 miles from Skudesn\u00e6s is a conspicuous sugarloaf islet named Smorstak. Having entered Skudesn\u00e6s fiord, vessels should give the south end of Karmo a berth of nearly 2 miles in order to avoid the dangers off Skudesn\u00e6s Havn, and when Smorstak is visible eastward of Karmo they may haul to the northward and enter the sound, keeping about 3 cables from the land on the west side. If coming from Stavanger a north-westerly course should be steered, after leaving Kvidso fiord, until Smorstak is open westwards West Bukn, which will lead clear of Arsgrund and the shoals off the south-west extreme of Ludn island. Arsgrund, a 3^-fathom patch about 3 cables in diameter, lies one mile S. E. from Kraaka, the southernmost islet off Ludn and West Bukn, and is marked by a buoy, Klepflue, the outermost of the shoals off the south-west extreme of Ludn extends nearly 3 cables westward of the point, and is marked by a staff and broom. From the south entrance of Karmsund to Kobbervig all the dangers are close inshore. Kobbernaglen, about 4 cables N.E. by E. from Kobbervig, and Kulorten, 3 cables southward of Hoievarde, are marked by iron"], [126, "108 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. IV, pillars; a shoal between Kobbernaglen and Karmo has an iron pole on it. Melandsflue, close to Hoievarde point, is marked by an iron pole. Snigsflue, one mile northward of Hoievarde, and 1| cables south of Snigs holm, carries 3 feet, and is also marked by an iron pole ; the outer edge of Snigsflue is about 1\\ cables from the mainland. At Augvaldsn\u00e6s and Salhus the passage is narrow but clear ; the current at these places is very strong, and at Salhus, where the sound is barely one cable in width, there are rings and warping posts on both sides. Northward of Salhus a shoal extends one-third of a cable from Gunnar haug. Storesundsflue, one mile northward of Salhus, lies close in to Karmo, and is marked by an iron pole, but as a shoal carrying 6 feet ex tends one cable farther to the eastward, vessels should keep on the east side of the sound until past the houses at Rossebo. Vomskaten, or West Storesundsflue, carrying 2\\ fathoms, lies 1^ cables south-westward of North Risoskjer, the northernmost of the small islets off the south end of Haugesund, and is marked by a staff and broom. After passing westward of Vomskaten, vessels may proceed either through west Karmsund or Vibrandsund. Turning through. \u2014 There is no difficulty in turning through Karmsund, between Skudesn\u00e6s and Hoievarde, when the tide is favour able, but northward of the latter point it should only be attempted by vessels of light draught, and it is impossible to beat against an adverse tide. AT NIGHT. \u2014 Hvidingso light is the best guide for the entrance to Skudesn\u00e6s fiord, and it must be remembered that the Skudesn\u00e6s light does not show until brought to bear eastward of Ostboen, or N.E. by N. ; it will then continue visible until the vessel is within the limits of Hoievarde light, and in the vicinity of Smorstak all three lights may be seen. CAUTION. \u2014 Should it be necessary to heave-to during the night, great attention must be paid to the bearings of Hvidingso and Skudesn\u00e6s lights, in order to avoid being carried towards either shore by the strong currents. ANCHORAGES. \u2014 There are two fair anchorages on the west side of Karmsund, viz., at Hoievarde and Augvaldsn\u00e6s, but, with these excep tions, the following harbours are of no use to large vessels. Tommervig, a small creek about half-way between Skudesn\u00e6s and Kobbervig, has a depth of 5 fathoms, and may be used temporarily by small craft ; a shoal extends one quarter of a cable from the land on the north side of the entrance. Rusevig, half a mile southward of Kobbervig, has a depth of 13 fathoms."], [127, "DIRECTIONS \u2014 BOVIG. 109 CHAP. IV.] Grdnnestadvaag, on the west side of West Bukn, has a depth of 16 to 6 fathoms, over a sandy bottom. Vessels using this anchorage must be secured with hawsers made fast to the rings on shore, and southerly winds are required for leaving. TrOSnavaag, H miles northward of Gronnestadvaag is a sheltered harbour with a depth of 8 to 12 fathoms, but is only used by small north ward bound vessels waiting wind or tide. There is a small anchorage, with 12 to 14 fathoms, between S\u00e6len and Lovo, north-eastward of Smorstak. Kobbervig is a small trading town with 900 inhabitants. There is a telegraph station here ; and supplies of water may be obtained. The harbour, which is very small, has a depth of 5 to 8 fathoms, over sand and mud, and is well supplied with mooring rings. Eidsbotten, the inner part of the creek, is a good winter harbour for vessels of 9 feet draught. Kaaleflue, one-quarter of a cable from the point on the south side of the entrance, and Treboskjer, which lies on a shoal extending one cable from the point south of the lighthouse, are marked by iron poles. At night the\" southern limit of Kobbervig light falls northward of Treboskjer, and the northern limit falls southward of Kobbernaglen. Having passed Treboskjer, give the lighthouse point a fair berth when entering the creek. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels may bring up about 2 cables northward of Kobbernaglen in 6 to 7 fathoms, and eastward of Bugn\u00e6s in 10 to 1 1 fathoms ; there is also anchorage for small craft in several small creeks between Kobbervig and Hoievarde. Hoievarde. \u2014 Large vessels may anchor between Hoievarde and Me landsflue in 16, 12, and 8 fathoms. Melandsflue, about 5 cables N.N.W. \\ W. from Hoievarde, and 3| cables S.W. by W. from Fladskjer, has one foot over it, and is marked by an iron pole. At night vessels should pass about 2 cables northward of the light, and directly its north-western limit is crossed the anchor should be dropped. Stopping places.\u2014 The best of the small stopping places between Hoievarde and Bovig, are those northward of Singsholm, and eastward of Buko, the island off Augvaldsn\u00e6s. The depth is 6 fathoms at both these places. Bdvig, the bay between Augvaldsn\u00e6s and Bo, is a good temporary anchorage, and may be used by northward bound vessels of any draught, when unable to pass Salhus owing to wind or tide. The depth varies from 8 to 19 fathoms, and the bay is clear with the exception of Kirkeflue, which carries 8 feet, and lies 2^ cables N.N.W. from the"], [128, "HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. 110 [chap. iv. north point of Bjurnholm, the islet eastward of Augvaldsn\u00e6s church ; and Boflue, which has 7 feet over it, and lies 1^ cables W.S.W. from Boskjer the southernmost of the rocks on the north side of the bay. Noreim and Storenesvig. \u2014 Southward bound vessels may bring up northward of the rocks off Noreim, while waiting wind or tide ; there is also a stopping place at Storenesvig, but care must be taken to avoid a shoal extending one cable to the southward from Storesundsflue. Leaning towards the north side of Augvaldsn\u00e6s church, is an ancient Scandinavian gravestone 26 feet high. This stone is known as \" The Virgin Mary's Needle,\" and, according to the legend, the world will come to an end when it falls against the church. A little farther north, on the apposite side of the sound, are five similar stones, from 8 to 16 feet high ; these are named \" The Five Foolish Virgins,\" and the highest of them is now used as a telegraph post. HAUGESUND or HOUGESUND,* an irregularly built town at the north end of Karmsund, stands partly on the mainland and partly on the islands Hasselo and Riso. The population is about 4,000. A little northward of the town is a conspicuous obelisk named Harald's stotten, or column, which, with the artificial mound on which it stands, is 65 feet high. This monument was erected in 1872, to commemorate the amalgamation of all the petty states in Norway into one kingdom by Harald Haarfager, in the 9th century. Supplies. \u2014 Supplies and water may be obtained at Haugesund. LIGHT. \u2014 On SSrhaugo, in the north entrance to Haugesund, is a square white tower, from which is exhibited, at an elevation of 71 feet, a fixed white light, visible 9 miles in all directions. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 There is a small harbour between Hasselo, Riso, and Garpeskjer, with a depth of 7 fathoms. In Smedsund, a very narrow channel between Riso and the mainland, there are about 4 fathoms ; but in the south entrance the depth is only 9 feet. In some parts of the sound between Hasselo and the mainland, there are only 5 feet; the depth is 11 feet at the south end of the channel, 15 feet at the north end, and 3 to 4 fathoms about one cable southward of the north entrance. There is also a small roadstead between the north-west point of Hasselo and SSrhaugo lighthouse, with a depth of 9 to 12 fathoms. Vessels anchoring here must lay out shore hawsers to the rings imme diately, as the current is very strong. None of these anchorages are available for large vessels. See Admiralty plan, No. 881 (in course of preparation)."], [129, "CHAP. IV.] 111 HAUGESUND \u2014 WEST KARMSUND. DANGERS. \u2014 The following dangers must be avoided when entering Haugesund from the southward. Risholmbo, carrying 2 fathoms, lies 1| cables southward of the south Garpeskjer. SSrhaugo lighthouse, open westward of the Garpeskjer cluster, leads westward of Risholmbo. Garpeskjer-rev, or reef, with 2\\ fathoms over it, extends nearly half a cable northward from the north Garpeskjer. A shoal, with 3 feet over it, extends three-quarters of a cable N.W. from Risholm, the small islet close to the south-west side of Riso. Tegneskjerskolten, about 30 yards northward of Riso, is marked by a pole beacon. SkagegTUnd, carrying 3 feet, lies close to the south-west point of Hasselo. Risdflue, or East Storesundsflue, one cable eastward of the north Risoskjer, is marked by an iron pole. Tyriflue, a shoal extending half a cable N.N.E. from North RisSskjer, is also marked by an iron pole. There is shoal water between Tyriflue and the South Risoskjer. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing westward of Vomskaten and Ri sholmbo, vessels may stand in between Garpeskjer reef and Hasselo Vessels of 10 feet draught may pass eastward of Risholmbo and Gar peskjer ; and those drawing 7 to 8 feet may pass eastward of the south Risoskjer, and between Tyriflue and East Storesundsflue, to Smedsund. WEST KARMSUND.\u2014 There are two channels leading north ward from Haugesund and Karmsund, viz., West Karmsund, between SSrhaugo and StorS, and Vibrandsund, between VibrandsS and Hasselo. The former is from one to 3 cables wide,' while the navigable channel of the latter narrows from one cable at the north end to barely 100 yards between the south-west point of HasselS and VibrandsS. The western channel is therefore preferable for large vessels at all times. There are numerous shoal patches on either side of West Karmsund, but the channel itself is straight, and the northern entrance is marked by the Skaareholm and Reiungen islets. Storakerflue, 1| cables south of Trolholm, the islet on the west side of VibrandsS, extends a good half cable from the latter island, and is marked by an iron pole. ViggingStadboen, one third of a cable from the north-west point of VibrandsS, is always awash. There are several rocks between Trolholm and Viggingstadboen, but they lie within half a cable of the shore."], [130, "112 HVIDINGSO TO ESPEV\u00c6R. [chap. iv. Sdrhaug shoals. \u2014 The shoals off SSrhaugtangen, a rocky point north of the lighthouse, extends 1\u00a3 cables to the northward, and nearly ll cables to the westward. Skaaretreboen, a rock just visible above water, lies 3\u00a3 cables S.E. by S. from Reiungen ; a shoal extends one cable westward from Skaaretreboen and the same distance to the eastward. ReiunggTUnd, a shoal carrying one to 3 fathoms, extends 2 cables northward and 1\\ cables south-eastward from Reiungen. Llangflue is a shoal spit extending 2 cables northward and nearly half a cable south-eastward from Storholm, the largest of the islets be tween StSro and the north point of KarmS. The south-eastern edge of Langflue has a staff and broom on it. Kraakeflue. \u2014 The eastern edge of a 3-fathom patch named Kraake flue, is about 4 cables E.N.E. from south Kraakeskjer. Skaareholm. \u2014 Shoals extends 1\\ cables eastward, and about one .able northward from the Skaareholm group. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing Vomskaten proceed in mid-channel between VibrandsS and Storholm. Give the SSrhaug islets a berth of 2 cables ; pass about one cable eastward of Kraakeflue, and 2 cables west ward of Skaaretreboen. After passing at least 2 cables eastward of the Skaare holms and 1-1 cables westward of Reiungen, bring SSrhaugo light house in line with Spanevarden, a conical hill about 3 miles S.E. by S. from Haugesund, taking care at the same time to avoid the shoal off the north point of Reiungen. Bramsflue is an 8-fathom patch a long mile N.W. by W. \\ W. from Store Bleiskjer ; when the latter rock is in line with the entrance to Bleivig the vessel will be about half a mile S.S.E. of Bramsflua and course may be altered for Bommel fiord. From the northward. \u2014 If bound through West Karmsund from the northward, vessels may stand in between RSv\u00e6r and the shoal off the Bleiskjers, two round rocks about H miles westward of Bleivig SSrhaugS lighthouse in line with, or open to the eastward of Spanevarden will lead westward of all the dangers between Ramsholm and Reiungen. Give the northernmost Skaareholm a berth of at least 2 cables when entering the sound, and proceed according to the foregoing directions. If bound for Haugesund, vessels may haul up for the anchorage east of Garpeskjer as soon as Skaare church comes in sight to the southward of VibrandsS, and after giving the south point of the latter island a berth of half a cable, they may proceed between Garpeskjer reef and HasselS. VIBRANDSUND and THE INNER LEAD. \u2014 The coast from Haugesund to BSmmel fiord being unprotected by islands, is exposed to a very heavy sea during westerly gales. The channel through"], [131, "CHAP. IV.] S0RHAUG SHOALS \u2014 FORLANDSVAAG. 113 Vibrandsund, and eastward of Bleiskjer and Ramsholm, is however con sidered as part of the Inner Lead. In Vibrandsund, the navigable channel is narrow and winding, and the currents are very strong, therefore this route should not be taken by large vessels. DANGERS. \u2014 In addition to the SSrhaug, Skaaretreboen, and Reiung shoals, the following dangers have to be avoided when the eastern channel is taken. Klungelflue, carrying 3 feet, lies about half a cable northward of the south-west point of HasselS, 20 yards from the shore. Hansevaagflue, westward of HasselS, is marked by an iron pole. Killingdgrund, north of Hasselo, is marked by an iron pole. A shoal extends one quarter of a cable westward from the north-west point of Hasselo. Kvalen. \u2014 A shoal extends two thirds of a cable north-westward from Kvalen, a low point about half a mile northward of SorhaugS lighthouse.

Marks. \u2014 Vessels will be eastward of all the dangers between SSrhaug and Storflue as long as the east side of West Bukn mountain is visible eastward of SSrhaug lighthouse. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing Vomskaten, Risholmbo, and Gar peskjer reef, give the south-west point of Hasselo a fair berth, in order to avoid Klungeflue, and proceed in mid-channel between Hasselo and Vibrandso. Keep on the west side of the channel when passing the north west point of Hasselo, and pass about one cable eastward of Sorhaugo and the rocks north of the lighthouse, borrowing to the westward when past the latter, in order to avoid the shoal off Kvalen. Bjorjenevarden, a hill between Salhus and the north end of Karmo, open westward of Sorhaugo lighthouse, will lead westward of Kvalen shoal, and up to Bleivig. When past Bleivig, keep in mid-channel between Ramsholm and the mainland, and proceed into Bommel fiord. Sorhaugo lighthouse must be kept in sight until the vessel is at least one mile northward of Ryvarden, in order to avoid Little Bloksten. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The following harbours between Haugesund and BSmmel fiord, are only available for small vessels ; they are all provided with mooring rings. Tdmmervig, 2\u00a3 miles northward of Haugesund, has a depth of. 4 fathoms. Fdrlandsvaag, immediately northward of TSmmervig, has a depth of 11 to 12 fathoms. Shoals extend a short distance to the westward from the islets in the entrance. Vessels must keep close to Raseln\u00e6s when entering or leaving the harbour. K 740.

GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 In order to preserve the connexion between the various channels as much as possible, it is necessary to follow the Inner Lead as far as Selbjorns fiord before proceeding with the description of the coast. BERGEN'S LEAD.*\u2014 The term \" Bergen's Led,\" or \"Lead,\" really comprises all the channels leading to Bergen from the southward ; but as a rule, it is only applied to BSmmel fiord and the channels usually taken by the coasting steam vessels when proceeding from thence to Bergen. The passage generally taken by the pilots, through Stoksund, Nyleden, and Bekkervig Sund, is very narrow in places ; and the Langenuen route (page 141), though longer by about 3 miles, is generally speaking far more convenient for vessels of war or other large steamers, and sailing vessels. In winter, however, the latter channel is only practicable by daylight, or moonlight, owing to the absence of leading lights. At night, Bergen's Lead may be considered safe with clear weather, a fair wind, and strict attention to the bearings of the different leading lights ; but pilots may always be obtained before entering the inner channels. Turning through. \u2014 Only vessels of light draught, and under able management, should attempt to turn through Bergen's Lead, as the chan nels are or the most part very narrow, and the tidal streams run through them with great velocity. Tides. \u2014 The general nature of the tides in the Bergen's Lead is de scribed in chapter IV. (page 97). BOMMEL FIORD (BOMMELEN) is abroad deep channel, free from dangers, and either side may be approached to within one or 2 cables. From a position half-way between Ryvarden and Bommelhuk, the course to Mosterhavh is N.E. E., distance 10^ miles. From Moster havn, vessels may either proceed northward through Stoksund and Nyleden, or eastward to Langenuen, and the inner fiords. * See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Norway, west coast, sheet I. Karmo to Bergen, No. 2,304. H 2"], [134, "116 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. V. Tides. \u2014 The flood stream sets in direct from seaward through BSmmel fiord, and the ebb stream runs out ; but here also the tides are affected by the prevailing winds. LIGHTS.\u2014 Lille Blegen\u2014 A fixed white light is shown from Lille Blegen, a small islet in the entrance to Langevaag. It is elevated 14 feet, and is visible for a distance of 8 miles between the bearings of N.E. by E. \\ E. through north and west, to S. by W. f W. ; it is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Midtholmen light, Mosterhavn, is a fixed red light, elevated 35 feet, and visible 6 miles between the bearings of N.E. f E. through north and west to S. by W. | W. ; it is also shown from the 15th July to the 15th of May. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The harbours in BSmmel fiord are generally speaking only available for vessels of moderate size, but there are several places where large vessels might find temporary anchorage. SOUTH-EAST SIDE.\u2014 Buavaag, about two miles north- eastward of Eltravaag (page 114), on the east side of Kvitan\u00e6s, has anchorage for very small vessels in 4 fathoms. There is also anchorage for small craft eastward of RisS, three-quarters of a mile from Kvitan\u00e6s. Tj emagel, half a mile north-eastward of Tjernagel hSien or hillock, has good anchorage for small craft on the west side of the islets within the bight, in 7 to 3 fathoms ; but is exposed to the northward. Vessels of any size might bring up for a time, in sine weather, to the southward and west ward of the outer islet; the depth here is 12 to 8 fathoms, but increases rapidly to the eastward and westward. Care must be taken to drop the anchor on the weather side of the bank, and shore hawsers must be laid out to the rings to secure the vessel against a shift of wind. Oklandsvaag, 1\\ miles eastward of Tjernagel, is a snug harbour for small craft, and has a depth of 6 fathoms. A rock carrying 3 feet lies 50 yards from the islet on the west side of the entrance. The bight to the westward of Oklandsvaag affords temporary anchorage in 5 fathoms. Eastward of Storholm, there is a good harbour with an area of about 5 acres, and a depth of 12 to 5 fathoms. Vessels of considerable size might lie here in safety, but they should be steadied by hawsers made fast to the rings on shore. To make the south entrance, vessels may pass on either side of the small islet lying half-way between Storholm and Liarskjer ; the latter rock is foul to a distance of two-thirds of a cable, and a rock with 6 feet over it lies half a cable S.E. from Storholm. A shoal spit extends two-thirds of a cable northward from the rock off the north-west side of Storholm, and foul"], [135, "CHAP. V.] BOMMEL FIORD; ANCHORAGES. 117 ground extends nearly half-way across the north entrance from the point on the east side. Hellevaag, a small creek three-quarters of a mile eastward of Stor holm, has a depth of 4 fathoms, but is barely 100 yards broad. Fordes-pollen extends 3 miles inland from Grimsholm and Lillenab, and has several small bights where small craft might anchor. Strdmdvaag, on the east side of Lillenab, affords anchorage for small vessels in 8 fathoms, but shore hawsers must be laid out if the wind is northerly, as the ground declines to the southward. Midvikholm. \u2014 With the wind westerly, or when drifting in a calm, a stream anchor might be dropped in 10 fathoms, shoaling to 5 fathoms near the islet ou the east side of Midvikholm. Valevaag. \u2014 Small vessels may anchor in 6 fathoms due west from the merchant's house in Valevaag, the bight northward of Valestrand church. A shoal extends from Nabben\u00e6s nearly halfway across the entrance, and the channel leading to the inner bight is narrow and foul. NORTH-WEST SIDE\u2014 Bommel Havn, a narrow cove, 2 miles from Bommelhuk, is the first harbour on the north-west side of BSmmel fiord ; it has a depth of 6 to 10 fathoms over clay, and might be used by vessels of moderate size, but they would have to be steadied by hawsers made fast to the rings. Vessels must keep close to the land on the west side when entering or leaving the harbour. Havneholme may be passed on either side at a prudent distance. LANGEVAAG. \u2014 The entrance to Langevaag, on the south-east side of BSmmelo, is marked by the wooden lighthouse on Lille Blegen. Southward of Rundo, the island on the north side of the entrance, there is a good harbour, with an area of about 9 acres, where vessels of considerable size may anchor in 12 fathoms, and moor with hawsers made fast to the rings on shore. The inner anchorage has a depth of 11 fathoms shoaling to 6, but a shoal extends from the south point of Rundo more than half-way across the entrance. Shoals extend about one cable off shore to the southward of Uretangen, and there are rocks on either side \u00a9f the entrance southward of Lille Blegen. If coming from the southward, give the land southward of Uretangen a berth of 2 or 3 cables ; Store Blegen maybe passed on either side at a distance of half a cable, and the entrance between Lille Blegen and RundS is perfectly clear. At night. \u2014 Lille Blegen light bearing N.W. will lead between Uretangen and Store Blegen. If coming from the eastward, bring the light to bear S.W. by W., and steer for it, proceeding in mid-channel be-"], [136, "118 [CHAP. V. ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. tween Rundo and the point on the south side of the entrance to the harbour. B\u00c6RO FIORD. \u2014 In B\u00e6rS fiord, between BommelS and Mostero, there are several bights where small vessels may bring up while waiting wind or tide to pass through the Kulseids canal to the west coast of BommelS (page 125). On the eastern side of the entrance to the fiord, about 2 cables off shore, are the Ramsholm shoals, on which there are 3 to 6 feet. Fladholmflua, a rock carrying 2 fathoms, lies 2\\ cables S.E. by E. \\ E. from Fladholm, the islet eastward of FladS. When entering B\u00e6ro fiord, kept the eastern Napholm visible westward of Totholm, in order to clear the Ramsholm shoals ; give the west side of RudsS a berth of about 2 cables, and pass one cable eastward of Fladholm. The channel between Hanshovdeholm and Klubben\u00e6s, the point on the north side, is perfectly clear ; eastward of OlvesS there are rocks on either side of the fairway, but most of them show above water. There is anchorage at Saxeid, and also in the inner part of the bight eastward of Finaas. About one cable S.S.E. from the latter point is a rock carrying 3 feet. Mostero. \u2014 The south side of MosterS is clean to within a distance of one cable, and there are several places where small vessels might bring up in calm weather. Mosterhavn, a fishing village at the south-east extreme of Mostero is noted for its church, which is the oldest in Scandinavia, and was built in the 1 Oth century by Olaf TiygvessSn. Water may be obtained here. Pilots* for Bergen can always be obtained at Mosterhavn. Anchorage. \u2014 The outer harbour has anchorage for three or four small vessels in 8 to 10 fathoms over sand and clay, and is provided with mooring rings, but southerly gales send in a considerable swell, and northerly winds are generally required for leaving. The best position is towards the east side of the harbour, with Midtholmen lighthouse bearing E. by N. Should it come on to blow from the southward, it is better to shift. farther in, and bring up in 6 fathoms N.W. from the lighthouse, where the vessel will be less exposed to the swell. The inner harbour has a depth of 4 fathoms, but can only be entered by vessels of very light draught. When entering or leaving Mosterhavn, keep well over towards the islet on the east side, as a shoal extends a short distance from Mosterhuk. STOKSUND and NYLEDEN.\u2014 Stoksund, between BSmmelS and Stordoen, is the continuation of Bergens Lead from BSmmel fiord. There are several channels leading into Selbjorns fiord from Stoksund, * Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey, H.M.S. Black Eagle, 1870."], [137, "CHAP. V.] B\u00c6RO FIORD \u2014 DALESTEN. 119 but Nyleden, or the New Lead, so termed from its having superseded the others formerly in general use, is by far the best. LIGHTS. \u2014 The west side of the entrance to Stoksund is marked by Midtholmen light, at Mosterhavn (see page 116). Folgerd. \u2014 A fixed white light is shown at an elevation of 49 feet from the point on the south side of the entrance to Folgerohavn, 6\\ miles northward of Mosterhavn. It is visible for a distance of 8 miles between the bearings of N. \\ W. through west and south to S.|E., and is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Ringholm. \u2014 On the east point of Ringholm, 6 miles northward of Folgero, a fixed white light, elevated 27 feet, and visible 10 miles between the bearings of N. | W. through west and south to S. \u00a7 E., is shown from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. BEACON. \u2014 At the north end of Nyleden, a white stone beacon with a black belt stands on Seglodden, the point on the east side of the entrance. DANGERS. \u2014 The following dangers must be avoided when passing through Stoksund and Nyleden with a fair wind or under steam. Hestholmflue, nearly 2 cables S.S.W. from Little Hestholm, on the east side of the southern entrance to Stoksund, carries 6 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom. FolgerS lighthouse in line with the west point of NautS leads westward ; Little Hestholm open to the westward of OterS leads eastward, and the two Hestholmsin line will lead northward of this rock. Klaksflue, a shoal patch with only 4 feet over it, lies one cable N.N.E. from Store KlaksS, at the north end of Stoksund ; the north extreme is marked by a staff and broom. Bremerholm shoals carry 2 feet, and lie about 2\\ cables northward of Store KlaksS, and the same distance eastward of Ostn\u00e6s, the east point of AgaS ; they are marked by three staff and broom beacons placed about N.N.W. and S.S.E. from each other. The east point ol \u00c6go touching the west point of OlfarS leads eastward. Krabbevigsflue, nearly one cable from the west side of OlfarS, and about a mile northward of the Bremerholm shoals, carries 2^ fathoms, and is marked by a staff and broom. The east points of FladS and Store KlaksS in line with lead eastward of this danger. East Knotholmsflue, carrying 21 fathoms, lies 2 cables S.E. by E. \\ E. from the south point of Knotholm, and is also marked by a staff and broom. The west side of OlfarS, open eastward of Ringholm, leads eastward of this shoal. Dalesten lies 1\\ cables southward of Olfarklub, the north-west extreme of OlfarS, about one-third of a cable from the shore ; the outer"], [138, "[chap. V. 120 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. extreme of a shoal extending nearly half a cable off shore, between Dalesten and Olfarklub, is marked by a staff and broom. Olfarskjer, about 4 cables N. I W. from Olfarklub, is visible above water ; at two-thirds of a cable S.S.E. from Olfarskjer is a rock carrying 6 feet, which is marked by a staff and broom. Segldflue, nearly 2 cables W.S.W. from Seglodde, the north extreme of SeglS, lies on the south extreme of a 10-fathom patch, and carries 4 fathoms. DIRECTIONS- \u2014 When entering Stoksund from BSmmel Fiord, give the east side of MosterS a berth of from one to 2 cables, and after passing between SpidsS and NautS, proceed in mid-channel till past Folgero and FladS. The east point of \u00c6gS touching the west point of OlfarS, will lead nearly in mid-channel between Bremerholm and Store KlaksS, and eastward of Klaksflue and the Bremerholm shoals. Should the beacons on the latter dangers have been washed away, keep Nyleden closed until within 2 or 3 cables of the south point of OlfarS. Give the south-west side of OlfarS a berth of about 2 cables, and when past Krabbervigsflue, open the sound to the eastward of TranS ; keep on the east side of the channel when passing Ringholm, and edge to the westward when near the point on the north side of Hatlevig. Give Dalesten a fair berth, and proceed in mid-channel through Nyleden to SelbjSrns fiord, giving Segleodde a berth of about 3 cables, in order to avoid Segloflue, When past Segleodde. course may be altered for Bekkervigsund or Stolmesund. Ostna3Shavn. \u2014 On the north side of Ostn\u00e6s, the north-east extreme of MosterS, is a good roadstead which may be used by northward or south ward bound vessels while waiting wind or tide. Small vessels should anchor close to Ostn\u00e6s, in 8 fathoms, shoaling to 6 and 3 in the bin-lit between the two points ; the best position for large vessels is half-way between Troldholm and the south point of SpidsS, in 9 to 8 fathoms. Shore hawsers should always be laid out to prevent driving off the bank, and care must be taken not to drop the anchor on a rocky patch carryin\" 5 fathoms, situated about three-quarters of a cable S.S.E. from the south extreme of SpidsS. Nearly one cable N.E. by E. from Troldholm, is a rock with 2 fathoms over it. SpidSO or Betlehem Havn, on the east side of Spidso, is a small but convenient anchorage with 7 to 10 fathoms over sand and mud. The best berth for large vessels is westward of the rock in the entrance. When entering from the northward, the rock must be kept in line with the cairn on the south side of the harbour, until the vessel is past the cairn on the north side."], [139, "chap, v.] STOKSUND \u2014 RINGHOLM. 121 Slotholm. \u2014 There are 4 fathoms southward of Slotholm, on the west side of NautS, but the inner part of the bight is shoal. Stokkevig, 1^ miles northward of SpidsS, on the west side of Stoksund, has a depth of 10 to 3 fathoms, but the point on the south side ofthe entrance is foul half a cable to the north -eastward. Siggervaag, three-quarters of a mile northward of Stokkevig, has anchorage for small craft in 5 fathoms, but the entrance is very narrow, and carries only 7 feet at low water. Folgerd Havn has good anchorage for small vessels northward of the lighthouse, in 6 fathoms. Between the lighthouse point and FolgerS is a bar with 4 fathoms over it, therefore large vessels, when coming from the southward with a strong southerly wind, must drop an anchor in 8 fathoms about balsa cable south of the lighthouse, run out a bow hawser immediately to the ring on the point, weigh anchor, and drop into the harbour, mooring with astern hawser made fast to the ring on the opposite side. If coming from the northward, drop anchor in 12 fathoms abreast of the ring on the north side of the harbour, and proceed as directed above. FolgerS Havn may be left with all winds, and in case of necessity a couple of large vessels might lie here moored head and stern, but the mooring rings on the opposite sides of the harbour are barely one cable apart, and no vessel is allowed to lie in the fairway. The flood stream sets southward through the sound westward of FolgerS, and the ebb northward. Jyskevig. \u2014 In Jyskevig, a small bight between the points westward of Flado, there are 4 fathoms. Storevig has a depth of 5 fathoms, and is a snug harbour for small craft. The entrance, between Teineskjer and the Middle Storevigholm, is about one mile E. by N. from Bremerholm. A sunken rock lies one-third of a cable northward of the north Storevigholm. Agahavn, on the east side of Agao, is a fair harbour for vessels of moderate size, and may be left with all winds ; it extends about one cable every way, and has a depth of 8 fathoms. The entrance southward of Langholm is situated half a mile W. by S. from the south point of OlfarS. There are 15 fathoms in the narrow creek on the south side ofthe harbour, but a rock with one foot over it lies in the middle of the entrance. Small craft may pass northward of Langholm, and anchor in Nyvaag, westward of the rock in the middle of the bight. The sound between Nyvaag and Agahavn is only practicable, for vessels drawing 5 feet, at high water. * Ringholm. \u2014 There are 16 fathoms between the north point of\" Ringholm and TranS, opposite the mooring rings, but a rock carrying 3 fathoms lies one-third of a cable from Trano on the north side of the anchorage ; the tides are very strong. Vessels should moor with bow"], [140, "122 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. V. and stern hawsers, weigh anchor, and when ready to leave, make sail and slip. Hatlevig, on the west side of OlfarS, opposite Ringholm, would afford anchorage to vessels of burthen, but the space is small. There are 12 fathoms just inside the entrance, 8 fathoms opposite the merchant's house, and 6 fathoms further in. Shore hawsers should always be laid out to the rings directly the anchor is let go. When entering from the north ward, or leaving with a southerly wind, care must be taken to avoid a shoal, marked by a staff and broom beacon, which extends one quarter of a cable from the point on the north side of the entrance. Vessels may bring up during a calm about 2 cables south ofthe entrance to Hatlevig, and 100 yards from the west side of OlfarS, in 8 fathoms. Segldhavn, between 'Slotteholm and SeglS, has good anchorage in 10 fathoms, but a shoal extends from SeglS to the small islet eastward of Aarebraadtholm, and northerly winds are required for leaving. Kirkesund, between TorsdagsS and \u00c6gS, affords fair anchorage, and may be left with all winds, but there is a considerable swell during north-westerly gales. The best position is in the western part of the sound, on the north side, in 12 to 14 fathoms, with shore hawsers laid out to TorsdagsS. Small vessels may anchor on the south side of the sound westward of the small rocks, in 7 fathoms. Shoals extends a short dis tance from the points on either side of the eastern entrance. Channel eastward Of Segld.\u2014 In order to avoid beating out into SelbjSrns fiord through Nyleden during westerly or north-westerly winds, small vessels may pass southward and eastward of Slotteholm and SeglS, and between Haabeholm and Porsholm ; or they may stand to the eastward between Dyrholm and EngesundsS, and proceed between Porsholm and Leiarholm. These channels are narrow and intricate, and should not be attempted without a pilot, though most of the dangers are visible. Porsholm is foul to a distance of nearly half a cable to the west ward and northward, and a rock on the north extreme of a shoal extending one cable N.N.W. from Haabeholm is always awash. ENGESUND'S LEAD passes eastward of Bremerholm, OlfarS, Ivarso, and Fladholm ; and through Engesund, between EngesundsS and TelS, to SelbjSrns fiord. There is also a channel between EngesundsS and IvarsS, but it is extremely intricate. Engesund is very narrow, and northward of the trading establishment, only 8 or 9 feet can be counted on at low water, therefore this passage cannot be considered available for vessels drawing more than 6 or 7 feet, and should not be attempted when coming from the northward at night, owing to the difficulty of recognising the entrance. Kaaloflue, one cable westward of Kaalo, on the east side of the"], [141, "HATLEVIG \u2014 TELOSUND'S LEAD. 123 CHAP. V.] southern entrance to Engesund's Lead carries 3 feet, and is marked by an iron pole. Hyseflue, a shoal carrying 6 feet, extends half a cable W.N.W. from Hyseholm, the islet north of Hjelmen, and is marked by a staff and broom. In the narrowest part of Engesund the land on either side is foul to a short distance offshore ; the deepest water, 2 fathoms, lies westward ofthe staff and broom beacon on a large stone off TelS. Besides the above dangers, care must be taken to avoid shoals extending one cable southward from the south point of IvarsS, one quarter of a cable eastward from the north and south points of Fladholm, and the same distance from the south point of EngesundsS. Tides. \u2014 In Engesund the tidal streams turn at half flood and half ebb, thus the stream sets northward at low water, and southwards at high water ; they are however very irregular in unsettled weather, but their velocity is almost always considerable. Anchorage. \u2014 In case of necessity Fattigmandshavn, on the south east side of OlfarS, would afford anchorage to a couple of small craft ; Engesund affords anchorage almost throughout, to the northward of the merchant's house ; and Jagtehavn, on the north-west side of TelS, has good anchorage in 5 fathoms, but is not much used except by small vessels, and in fine weather. TELOSUND'S LEAD.\u2014 Vessels of 7 to 10 feet draught may pass southward of EngesundsS, Pilholm, and TelS and through Telosund (the channel between TelS and FondS), to the northward ; tnis passage is known as TelSsund's Lead, and is frequently used by small vessels when the wind is fair. If intending to run through from the southward, proceed as directed above until past EngesundsS ; give the south side of Pilholm a fair berth, and keep nearest to TelS when passing Kjeholm, in order to avoid a rock lying close to the latter islet, immediately eastward of the narrowest part of the channel. Give the point on the east side of the southern entrance to Telosund a fair \"berth, and after passing eastward of the rock at the south end of the sound, continue in mid-channel between FondS and the rock off the north end of Lamholm. Valbjerg, a hill half a mile east ward of Store EldS, kept in the middle of the latter channel, bearing S.S.E., leads into SelbjSrns fiord, between the shoals off Leiarholm and TelS. Anchorage. \u2014 There is good anchorage in TelSsund, to the south eastward of Lamholm in 10 fathoms. NYLEDEN to BRANDASUND\u2014 There is a passage leading northward of TranS ; westward of TorsdagsS, between EidS and SolS, and southward of UrS and SelS, to Brandasund. Small vessels"], [142, "124 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. V. sometimes take this channel in rough weather in order to avoid the sea in SelbjSrns fiord. To pass northward of TranS, keep close to the south point of Baarholm, and steer about N.W. till close to TranS. Pass northward of all the rocks off the north point of the latter island, and steer for the channel between EidS and the north point of Solo, giving the north-east side of that island a good berth. If coming from SelbjSrns fiord, give Seglodde a berth of about 3 cables, proceed in mid-channel through Kirkesund, and steer for the north point of SolS. Keep close to the last-mentioned point when standing to the westward, and pass a short half cable southward of South Uro, in order to avoid a shoal off Skibeholm ; give the north point of Spansholm a fair berth, and edge quickly to the southward, to clear a shoal extending one third of a cable southward from the western Kaperskjer. Give the rocks northward of Kvarnan\u00e6s a berth of nearly 100 yards, taking care not to approach the south side of SelS within two-thirds of a cable ; and keep two-thirds over from VikS until near the entrance to Brandasund. COAST. GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 The coast line of the islands fronting the mainland between the parallels of Espev\u00e6r and Kors fiord trends generally in aN. by E. and S. by W. direction, but is very irregular. About 20 miles northward of BSmmelhuk, the south point of BommelS, is the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord, and the entrance to Korsfiord is about 1 1 miles northward of Furens rock (at north side of entrance to SelbjSrns fiord). These inlets, which are separated by a group of islands, are the most northern of the great southern entrances to Bergen, and are therefore of considerable importance. When passing to the westward of BommelS, it is advisable to keep an offing of 4 or 5 miles, as although most of the dangers are either visible above water, or indicated by breakers, they extend some distance seaward, and during light winds the flood stream frequentlv sets strongly in shore. If bound for Bergen, it is best under ordinary circum stances to bring Siggen to bear about S.E. or S.E. by S. keeping rather the southward on account of the northerly set, until the entrance to one of the above mentioned inlets is clearly made out. There are numerous an chorages between Espev\u00e6r and Kors fiord, some of which would afford shelter to vessels of large draught in cases of necessity, but very few could be used by line-of-battle ships. * Lieut. G. T. Temple, K.N.,1874-5."], [143, "CHAP. V.] 125 GENERAL REMARKS \u2014 ESPEV\u00c6R. BOMMELO is a large irregularly shaped island, about 18 miles in length, and is divided into two parts near the centre by Kulseid canal, which is about 200 yards long, and has 10 feet of water in it at half flood. The western entrance to the canal is in the southernmost of the two bights, at the inner end of the bay eastward of Hisken ; the eastern entrance is at the inner end of B\u00e6rS fiord. The west coast of BSmmelS is very irregular, and is partially protected from the sea by a number of small scattered islands, eastward of which there is a fair channel. Between Melingsvaag and SelbjSrns fiord the islands increase in size and number. The harbours on the west coast of BSmmelS are all provided with mooring rings, but are only adapted for vessels of moderate size. PILOTS may be obtained from various parts of BSmmelS, and all the inhabited off- lying islands. ASPECT Of COAST. \u2014 When approaching BSmmelS from sea ward, Siggen will be seen in tolerably clear weather before any other part of the coast is visible, and as already observed is a most important landfall. The high land on the east side of Stordoen forms a plateau about three miles in length, rising slightly to the rounded summits of Mehammersaata and Staavegolvsfjeld at the north and south extremes, and is visible in clear weather from a great distance. BSmmelS is generally of moderate height, and as the off-lying islets are much lower, they are not easily distinguished till the vessel is within 10 miles of the land. Yraskallen, a shoal carrying 10 fathoms, is the outermost of the shoal patches off the west coast of BSmmelS, and during heavy weather its position is frequently indicated by breakers ; it lies 3^ miles W. by N. \u00a3 N. from the north point of StolS, with Siggen bearing E. by S. \\ S., and Brandasuudssaata in line with GodSn\u00e6s. ESPEV\u00c6R, the southernmost cluster of islands off the west coast of BSmmelS, has a small but safe harbour, with a depth of 11 fathoms, be tween Espev\u00e6io and OdneS. SvartesjSen, between Espev\u00e6rS and Nauto, has anchorage for 5 or 6 vessels of moderate size, in 10 to 11 fathoms. Northerly winds are required for leaving Espev\u00e6r by vessels drawing more than 1 1 feet, but smaller craft may pass through the narrow passages leading northward from both anchorages. LIGHT- \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 75 feet, and visible 6 miles, is shown from a small wooden building on SaugS, from the 1st of October to the 31st of March. SaUgdbO, half a cable from the south point of SaugS, and two-thirds of a cable eastward of Marholm, is marked by an iron pillar. There are no dangers between BSmmelhuk and East Gunnarskjerflue."], [144, "126 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [CHAP. V. The entrance to Espev\u00e6r harbour is between SaugS and Skarholm. Shoals extend about one-third of a cable to the south-westward from the south points of OdneS and Skarholm, the islet east of the lighthouse ; and a shoal carrying 2 fathoms extends about 30 yards from the north-east side of SaugS. The best entrance to SvartesjSen is between Marholm and Saugobo, but vessels may, if necessary, pass between the latter rock and SaugS. Nord and Hols islands (NordSerne and HolsSerne) extend nearly 4 miles northward of Espev\u00e6r, and 3 miles westward of BSmmelS ; they are separated from each other by a channel one mile broad, at the east end of which, 4 cables S. by W. from the southern Svarteskjer, is a rock carrying 5 fathoms. The outermost dangers off these islands are Hvaloflua and SvartSgrunden ; the former carries 6 fathoms and lies 1^- miles west ward of HvalSkalv, and the latter is above water and about 1^ miles W.S.W. from the south point of SvartS. There are two small anchorages for fishing vessels on the east side of Nord islands. Kallevaag, EidSVaag, and Roaldsfiord, the inlets between BSmmelhuk and South Giso, afford anchorage for small vessels in 4 to 6 fathoms. The best berth is opposite the houses at Teievig, in Eidsvaag ; vessels should keep in mid-channel when entering. Vige Fiord. \u2014 After passing Dyren\u00e6sflue, which carries 3 fathoms, and lies l?s cables west of Dyren\u00e6s, vessels may enter Vige fiord and bring up in 7 fathoms at one cable northward of the rocks on the west side of the bight. Rundeflue, 1^ cables eastward of Vigen\u00e6s, the point on the north side of the entrance, carries 6 feet. Gisosund, immediately northward of Vige fiord, between South GisS and Bommelo, may be entered either from the northward or southward, and is easy to get away from. Good? anchorage will be found during southerly gales off the north point of South Giso, in 16 fathoms ; there are mooring rings on both sides of the sound. East GisOVaag, on the east side of North GisS, may be entered with the wind from N.W., through north to E.S.E., but there are several shoal patches in the entrance. Tides. \u2014 The tidal streams turn regularly in Gisosund at high and low water, the flood setting to the northward, and the ebb to the southward. Grdtle Fiord, H miles northward of GisS, has anchorage for small vessels in 11 fathoms, but is exposed to south-westerly gales. Stokvig, a cove about one mile northward of GrStle fiord, has a depth of 3 fathoms, and is sometimes used by small coasters."], [145, "127 CHAP. V.] NORD ISLANDS \u2014 SVINOOSEN. Nautd and Gjeidung. \u2014 There is a small creek on the south-east side of Nauto, with a depth of 9 fathoms. Vessels of 5 feet draught may pass through the sound between Nauto and Gjeidung, which also affords anchorage for small coasters. Ndkling islands. \u2014 The NSklings are two small islands about one mile north-eastward of Gjeidung ; the sound between them affords fair anchorage, in 10 fathoms, but the swell is severely felt in rough weather, and it is difficult to leave with easterly winds. The west end of the sound is shoal, and a reef extends one-third of a cable from the north-east point of South Noklinff. a Toska. \u2014 There are 12 fathoms in the bight on the east side of Toska, the island west of North NSkling. Vessels may enter either from the northward or southward, keeping close in to Toska, or they may pass on either side of Store Toskaskjer, the largest of the line of rocks protecting the anchorage. COAST. \u2014 From the NSklings the coast of BSmmelS trends north eastward about 3 miles, and then bends round to the westward forming an extensive bay, with a number of bights and [inlets, most of which afford anchorage for small vessels. On the north side of this bay lie the Hisken islands, which are surrounded by numerous islets and rocks ; the south side is clear, and carries a depth of 41 to 66 fathoms. There is anchorage at Vorn\u00e6s, and also northward of Kulseid, for vessels waiting to pass through the canal. Hisken. \u2014 There is a fair summer harbour, with a depth of 6 fathoms. shoaling to the northward, between the south-east side of Hisken and Hiskeholm, three-quarters of a mile northward of the NSklings ; the bottom consists of sand. A heavy sea sets in during southerly gales, and northerly winds are generally required for leaving, as the passage northward of Hiskeholm is intricate, and only available for small vessels. The southern entrance is clear, with the exception of Moddingsbo, , which lies three quarters of a cable N.E. from Hiskehove, and is nearly always awash. SvindOSen, eastward of KomleS, has good anchorage in 5 fathoms. The best entrance is between Nyving rocks and the islets off the west side of Hisken. Small vessels may, if necessary, pass southward of Svarto, and westward of LyngsS ; there is also a channel leading northward from the anchorage, but it is narrow and intricate. Foul ground extends about one cable from the west side of StolS, the islet on the south side of the entrance. There are 4 to 8 fathoms between the Ny vings, and the same depth over a spit extending one cable S.W. from the south rock. Lyngsobo, one cable N.E. from HSieblegen, and the same distance S.E. from LyngsS, carries 6 feet ; North LyngsSbo, half a cable N.N.E. from LyngsS, carries 8 feet ; and a shoal extends nearly"], [146, "128 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [CHAP. V. one-third of a cable from the point on the east side of the entrance to the harbour. Olvaanda, one mile W.S.W. from Hisken, open to the eastward of HSieblegen, a small islet 2 cables E.N.E. from the Nyving rocks, will lead eastward of LyngsSbo ; and HSieblegen open eastward of LyngsS, leads eastward of North LyngsSbo. S6nstab6vaag. \u2014 Northward of KomleS is the entrance to SSnsta bSvaag, a very narrow inlet sometimes used by small coasters. MELINGSVAAG.*\u2014 About If miles northward of Nyving rocks, is the entrance to Melingsvaag, a snug harbour with an area of 9 acres. The best anchorage is in 7 to 9 fathoms, N.N.E. of Lillen\u00e6sholm, a small islet on the south side ofthe harbour. Water may be obtained from a spring close to the houses. Pilots. \u2014 The entrance to Melingsvaag is not easy for strangers to make out, but they may generally heave-to under the lee of the Maagsten until a pilot can get on board. MaagStensflue and KlOVSkjerflue are two rocks carrying 11 fathoms; the former lies one mile W.JN. from the north point of the Maagsten, and the latter, 1^ miles N.W. i W. from the same point. Maagsten. \u2014 The Maagsten lies one mile westward of the entrance to Melingsvaag, and being larger and higher than the islets in its vicinity will be easily recognised ; it is clean close to all round. Svarte rocks, 4 cables S.S.E. \u00a3 E. from the Maagsten, are visible above water; atone cable N.E. from the western Svarteskjer, is a shoal carrying 5 fathoms. Langeskjerflue, a rock carrying 2 fathoms, lies 2 cables W. by N. \u00a3 N. from the. north point of Langeskjer, and 3 cables east of the north point of the Maagsten. A narrow shoal, carrying 6 fathoms, extends 1| cables in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction between Langeskjer and the Kl\u00e6kstens. Indre rocks are visible above water ; there is shoal water between them, and a 4-fathom patch lies 2 cables S.W. \u00a7 S. from the South Indreskj er. The south point of the Maagsten, visible southward of the South Kl\u00e6ksten, loads clear to the southward. Blegeflue, a shoal of 6 fathoms, lies one-third of a cable westward of the islet on the south side of the entrance, and generally breaks during southerly gales. Danmarksflue, of 3% fathoms, lies two-thirds of a cable S.W. from Danmark, the islet between Aksten and Katholm. * In June 1874, the yacht Annie found shelter in Melingsvaag, when unable to fetch the entrance to Selbjorns fiord owing to a strong northerly gale. Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N."], [147, "129 CHAP. V.] MELINGSVAAG \u2014 BRAND ASUND. Sv\u00e6lteflue, a patch with 2 feet over it, extends nearly half a cable from BSmmelS, about S.S.E. from the east point of Katholm. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When coming from the southwards, keep Skar veskjer open westwards of Laxeblegen till the southernmost house on Melingsn\u00e6s is visible northward of Ileblegen, the northernmost rock on the south side of the entrance ; then steer direct for the south point of Katholm, which is clean close-to, and after passing close eastward of the latter islet in order to avoid Sv\u00e6lteflue, proceed in mid-channel to the anchorage. Small vessels may pass through the narrow channels between BSmmelS and the islets north and south of the entrance to the harbour. From seaward. \u2014 The Maagsten will be in line with Siggen when the latter bears S.E. by E. E.; this mark will lead between Klov skjerflue and Maagstensflue. The channel northward of Langeskjer is li cables broad. Oklandsvaag, 1{ miles northward of Melingsvaag, has a depth i 8 to 10 fathoms, and there is good anchorage in 16 to 10 fathoms, north eastward of Lamholm. The best entrance from the southward is between Lamholm and Oklandsholm. Hillesdsund. \u2014 At the north end of Hillesosund, one mile northward of Lamholm, there is anchorage in 11 fathoms. Katie and Goddhavn. \u2014 There is a sheltered cove at Katie, on the west side of GodS, with a depth of 6 fathoms. Godohavn, the creek south of GodSn\u00e6s, has a depth of 15 to 10 fathoms. Haapollen. \u2014 South-eastward of GodSn\u00e6s, the north-west point of GodS, is a fair harbour for vessels of burthen, but a rock with one foot over it, lies nearly in the middle of the anchorage, and southerly winds are required for leaving. Vessels must keep close to the west side of LegS when entering. BRANDASUND, between Giso and Selo, affords good anchorage for vessels of burthen, in 13 to 18 fathoms, and is easy of ingress and egress. o Water may be obtained here. Goddskjer. \u2014 The north-west edge of the foul ground surrounding the GodS rocks, a cluster northward of GodSn\u00e6s, is three-quarters of a mile N.W. | N. from the point. Housaboen is a 2-fathom patch lying half a mile N. by W. \u00a3 W. from the western GodSskjer. SlotterS lighthouse, in line with Kvitingen, leads westward of it. Kvitingsflue, of 3 fathoms, lies 3 cables S. by W. from Kvitingen. A shoal extends about one cable from the entrance to the bight east ward of the south-west point of GisS ; and the east point of Janagelholm, K 740. x"], [148, "130 [chap. V. ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. a small islet on the north side of SSndreosen, is foul to a distance of one third of a cable. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Skarveskjerhaug, a hillock on the north-west side of VikS, in line with Janagelholm, will lead in between Housaboen and Kvitingen. SSndreosen, the channel between GisS and Olverso, kept well open, leads between Housaboen and GodS rocks. Eastward of Jana gelholm the channel is perfectly clear. Northern entrance. \u2014 From SelbjSrns fiord, vessels may pass on either side of Staalhove, which lies about half-way between the north point of SelS and the islets north of GisS, and proceed in mid-channel through Brandasund ; a shoal extends a short distance from SelS in the narrowest part of the sound. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Vessels proceeding from Espev\u00e6r to SelbjSrns fiord, inside the islands off the west coast of BSmmelS, usually pass westward of GisS, and eastward of LyngS, Gjeidung, and Toska. The Jernholms are three small islets southward of the NSklings ; a rock lies half a cable south of the Western Jernholm, but it is visible above water. Westward of North NSkling are the Svarte rocks, and at one cable N.W. from the Western Svarteskjer is a rock carrying 6 fathoms. When bound to or from Hisken, it is best to pass eastward of the NSklings. After passing the islets south of Hisken at a distance of from one to 2 cables, course may be steered direct for the Maagsten, which will lead westward of the Nyvings and Svartoflue, a 9-fathom patch, lying 3 cables W. by N. \\ W. from the south point of SvartS. Godostak, a hill on the south] extreme of GodS, in line with the west point of Bremsundsholm, will lead between SvartSflue and SvartSrev, which carries 6 fathoms, and extends If cables westward from SvartS ; these marks will also lead westward of the shoals off Guleholm. When past SvartSflue, course should be altered to bring GodSstak open to the eastward of the North Indreskjer, which will lead clear up to South Korsholm, the 'islet north of Indre rocks. From thence vessels may either proceed northward through Hillesosund, or between Lamholm and Oklandsholm, and eastward of Hilleso. After passing close eastward of Rogo, Tr\u00e6tholm, and North Fiskeholm, the course lies between Grundebo and Godon\u00e6s, and from thence westward of Giso to SelbjSrns fiord. Grundebo, a rock carrying 6 feet, lies 3 cables N.W. by W. \\ W. from GodSn\u00e6s, on the south extreme of the foul ground off GodS rocks. South Fiskeholm, open eastward of North Fiskeholm, leads between Grundebo and GodSn\u00e6s ; and the middle of the Eastern Godoskjer in line"], [149, "CHAP. V.] 131 GENERAL DIRECTIONS. with the east point of North Fiskeholm will lead between GisS and the islets to the westward. There is a fair channel leading eastward from SSndreosen to Nyleden, but it is very narrow in places. There are several passages besides the above between the islands off the north-west side of BSmmelS, and anchorage may be found at various places, but it is all pilotage water, and the islets and rocks, though accurately laid down on the chart, are too numerous to admit of minute description. From seaward. \u2014 Between Espev\u00e6r and Melingsvaag, there are several channels leading to the west coast of BSmmelS from seaward ; the western of these is that between Hols islands and Skotning (the island west of NautS), and Gjeidung. About half a mile westward of Skotning is a patch of foul ground with 9 to 13 fathoms over it, and Holsflue, a rock carrying 11 fathoms, lies 9 cables N.W. f N. from SvartS, the western most of Hols islands. The channel between Skotning and Olvaanda is clear. CAUTION. \u2014 In rough weather, vessels ought to keep an offing of at least 2 miles between the Maagsten and SlotterS until the channel to be steered for is clearly made out. ASPECT OF COAST.\u2014 When approaching the land between BommelS and Kors fiord, the mountain Tysn\u00e6ssaata, on Tysn\u00e6sSen, is a conspicuous landmark, having a lofty rounded summit. The whole of Tysn\u00e6sSen is lofty, being equal in height to the mainland in its vicinity. StordSen rises to about the same elevation, and both may be seen from a great distance in clear weather. Folgefond, the great snow-field in Har danger, farther inland, is sometimes visible, and Siggen will appear to the southward like a pyramid with a broad base. If farther to the northward, the southern part of SotrS (SartorS) willappear very high, and the islands on the south side of Kors fiord much lower. From an offing of about 10 miles, the coast between Stolmen and Store Kallso has the appearance of a deep bay, of which Huftero forms the inner shore. HufterS and SelbjornsS are about the same height; the other islands and islets southward of Kors fiord are much lower. From this position the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord and Kors fiord, with SlotterS and Marsten lighthouses, and Furens beacon, will be distinctly visible. SELBJORNS FIORD. \u2014 SelbjSrns, or as it is frequently termed SelbS fiord, extends about 8 miles from the entrance in an easterly direc tion ; it then joins Langenuen. The channel decreases in breadth from 3J miles, between SlotterS and Furens, to H miles at the east end. The depth varies from 126 to 176 fathoms. SelbjSrns fiord is connected with BSmmel and Kors fiords by the Bergen's Lead, and is one of the principal entrances to Bergen. i 2"], [150, "132 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. V. LANDMARKS. \u2014 On nearing the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord, the principal landmarks that will be recognised, besides those already men tioned, are Handfjeldssaata, a lofty hill 3 miles S.S.E. from the north point of StordSen, with a hollow like a saddle on the south side ; Brandasundssaata, a round knoll with a a rough cairn on the summit, near the north end of GisS ; and Kvitingen, a small islet at the south extreme of the cluster off the west coast of GisS. The position of a vessel may be ascertained by bearings of these landmarks, but SlotterS lighthouse is the most useful object for making SelbjSrns fiord. HjSringen is a low black rock one cable E.N.E. from SlotterS. LIGHTS. \u2014 Slotterd lighthouse, a circular iron tower on the south side of the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord, exhibits a fixed white light, elevated 147 feet, visible 18 miles seaward, and from the fiord. The tower, which stands near the north point of SlotterS, is 82 feet high, and being painted red, with a white belt 24 feet broad, is a conspicuous day mark. Oxhammer lighthouse, a small wooden building on the east point of SelbjornsS, exhibits a fixed white light, elevated 129 feet, and visible for a distance of 8 miles between the bearings of E.N.E., (which leads north of HSklen) and N.E. \\ N. (which leads west of Segloflue) also between the bearings of N. by E. \\ E. through west to S. by W. The light is shown from the 15th of July to the loth of May. Beacon. \u2014 The north side of the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord is marked by a conical white stone beacon on Furens, a rocky islet 350 yards long which lies 3\u00a3 miles N. \\ E. from SlotterS lighthouse. Hoklen is a rocky ledge about one mile westward of SlotterS ; it is 2 cables in length, in a N. \\ E. and S. \\ W. direction, one cable broad, and has only 2 fathoms over its southern extreme : the north extreme, over which there are 8 fathoms, lies 9 cables W. \\ N. from the lighthouse. South Fiskeholm, visible westward of Kvitingen, leads westward ; and Handfjeldssaata, in line with HjSringen, E. \\ S., leads northward. HOKKELS SHOALS and INDREBOEN are four sunken rocks lying nearly in the middle of the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord. Hok kelsbo carries 2 fathoms, and lies 1-j^ miles N.N.W. \\ W. from SlotterS lighthouse. Indreboen carries 3 fathoms, and lies 1T7^ miles N. by W. from the light house, and 4 cables W. by N. \\ N. from HSkkelsbo. The North HSkkels shoals are two rocky heads on a patch of foul ground extending one cable in a W. a N. and E. \\ S. direction. The western rock"], [151, "CHAr. V.] SELBJORNS FIORD. 133 carries 1 1 fathoms, and lies 1^ miles N. by W. | W. from SlotterS light house ; the eastern rock carries 12 fathoms, and lies If cables N.W. \\ N. from Indreboen. HSkkelsbo and Indreboen are indicated by breakers when there is anything like a swell, but the sea only breaks on the North HSkkels shoals in the most violent weather. Marks. \u2014 Handfjeldssaata in line with \u00c6gholm, bearing E. f S., leads southward of all the above dangers ; Handfjeldssaata in line with Ramsbjerg, the highest part of FondS, E. by S. S., or Tysn\u00e6ssaata in line with the south point of SelbjSrnsS, E. | S., will lead northward ; and Furens beacon bearing N.E., or SlotterS lighthouse S.E. by S., will lead westward. On the south side of SelbjSrns fiord, shoals extend one quarter of a cable northward from SlotterS and HjSringen. North \u00c6gholmskjer, a small rock 3 cables northward of \u00c6gholm, is foul to a distance of half a cable, aud there are several sunken rocks to the northward and westward of \u00c6gholm. Ostren\u00e6s shoals extend nearly 2 cables north-westward from Ostren\u00e6s, the north point of StordSen ; the east and west extremes are marked by an iron pillar and a staff and broom. Furens Shoal. \u2014 On the north side of the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord, between Furens and Stolmen, there are numerous rocks above and below water. A shoal extends about one cable S.S.E. from the south-east side of Furens, but with this exception the channel between that islet and HSkkels shoals is free from danger. PILOTS are stationed on SlotterS, and will come off from any of the inhabited islands. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If considered advisable to seek shelter before a pilot can get on board, vessels may safely stand in for the entrance to SelbjSrns fiord, pass either northward or southward of HSkkels shoals and proceed according to circumstances. Southward of HdkkelS Shoals.\u2014 If coming from the southward with a southerly wind, it is best to keep an offing of about 3 miles until Handfjeldssaata is in line with HjSringen, bearing E. i S., which will lead in northward of HSklen. When within half a mile of SlotterS, course may be altered either for Stolmesund, Bekkervig Sund, or Langenuen. Northward of HdkkelS Shoals. \u2014 Tysn\u00e6ssaata in line with the south point of SelbjSrnsS, bearing E. \\ S., will lead about 3 cables southward of Furens, which should not be approached nearer than 2 cables, and course may be altered for Stolmesund as soon as the channel is well open. When proceeding to the eastward, give the south side of SelbjSrnsS a berth of 2 or 3 cables until past the islet Torstenskirke, on the south side of SelbjSrnsS."], [152, "134 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORLS FIORD [chap. V. Handfjeldssaata in line with Ramsbjerg, bearing E. by S. i S., will lead 4 cables northward of North HSkkels shoals. AT NIGHT. \u2014 When approaching from the southward at night, bring SlotterS light between the bearings of E. by S. S. and S.E. by S., and steer for it until within the south-western limit of Oxhammer light, N.E. by E. | E. ; then steer direct for the latter, edging to the eastward when well past North \u00c6gholmskjer, and proceed according to the directions for Bergen's Lead. If coming from the northward, bring SlotterS light to bear S. \\ E., which will lead westward of all the dangers northward of Furens, and eastward of Indreboen. When well past Furens, an E. by S. course will lead within the western limit of Oxhammer light. Anchorage- \u2014 There are no harbours in SelbjSrns fiord itself, but good anchorage will be found in Brandasund, Stolmesund, and Bekkervig Sund. Haatvaag, a small exposed bight eastward of Torstenskirke, is occa sionally used by coasters and fishing vessels. BERGEN'S LEAD. BEKKERVIG SUND, between SelbjSrnsS and HufterS, is the direct continuation of Bergen's Lead from Nyleden and SelbjSrns fiord ; thence the channel leads westward of HufterS ; through Bagholmsund, Hundevaagosen, and Korshavnsund, to Kors fiord, where the various chan nels unite. The entrance to Bekkervig Sund is marked by Oxhammer lighthouse, situated 3^ miles N.E. from Nyleden. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 29 feet, and visible 8 miles, is shown from Pirholm, an islet on the east side of Bagholm Sund, about 6 miles northward of Oxhammer light; it is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. DANGERS. \u2014 Between SelbjSrns fiord and Kors fiord, the main channel of Bergen's Lead is free from dangers ; those in the vicinity of the various anchorages are described hereafter. StorebO, a rock carrying 2 fathoms, lies on the western extreme of a shoal extending one cable from the south point of Blen\u00e6sS, on the east side of the entrance to Bekkervig Sund, and is marked by a staff and broom. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Afterpassing Seglodde, course should be steered for Oxhammer point, which may be rounded at a distance of one to 2 cables. Proceed in mid-channel between SelbjSrnsS and HufterS, and steer for the east side of GrSnningen, an islet 2\\ miles N. f W. from Bekkervig Sund north entrance. Give the west side of HufterS a berth of one cable, and"], [153, "CHAP. V.] 135 BEKKERVIG SUND. pass half a cable westward of the Sandholms, then steer for Pirholm lighthouse, and proceed in mid-channel between Pirholm and StaalS. Pass westward of Riugeskjer, a rock lying 3 cables northward of Pirholm, and from thence to the entrance to Korshavnsund the course is about N.N.E., distance 2| miles. Give the south point of KorshavnsS a berth of one cable, and proceed in mid-channel through the sound to Kors fiord. The east side of Skorpa is clean close-to, but a shoal extends nearly half a cable to the southward and westward from Ldjernet. When past the latter rock, course may be shaped for BSrnestangen. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 On the western side of Bekkervig Sund is a roadstead which would afford temporary anchorage to the largest vessels ; a heavy sea sets in during southerly gales, but it would only tend to drive a vessel farther up the bank, as the ground rises to the northward. The bottom consists generally of clay, but is rocky in places, and very uneven. The best position for vessels of war and other large vessels is nearly 2 cables east of North Rodholm, in 22 to 1 8 fathoms. Vessels of moderate draught may anchor three-quarters of a cable eastward of the same islet, and lay out a shore hawser to one ofthe rings. Rddholms. \u2014 The RSdholms are two small islets about half a mile northward of Oxhammer point, close in to the shore, they are one cable apart, and small vessels may bring up between them in 6 fathoms. North ward and southward of the RSdholms are several sunken rocks. Bekkervig.- \u2014 Off the entrance to Bekkervig, half a mile northward of the RSdholms, vessels of any description may bring up in 14 fathoms, shoaling towards the shore, and if considered advisable shore hawsers may be laid out to the rings. Kalsund, between the north point of Blen\u00e6sS and HufterS, affords anchorage to vessels of 6 feet draught, and may be entered either from the eastward or westward. Groteskjer. \u2014 Small craft may bring up for a time in 10 to 5 fathoms over sand and clay, between GrSteskjer and Ringen\u00e6s, the north-eastern extreme of SelbjornsS, but if the wind shifts to the north-westward they must weigh at once. BuSSesund, If miles northward of Bekkervig Sund, is a good and sheltered harbour available for vessels of burthen, but the entrance is very narrow, and northerly winds are required for leaving. At the north end of the sound there are 16 fathoms over sand and mud. Bagholmsund. \u2014 Small vessels might bring up in 18 to 20 fathoms between West Bagholm and StaalS to wait wind or tide, but they would be exposed to a swell. A shoal extends one-third of a cable to the northward from the small islet opposite the merchant's house."], [154, "136 [cuap. v. ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. On the west side of East Bagholm, there is very indifferent anchorage in 18 fathoms over rocky ground. Shoals extend half a cable to the north ward and eastward from Ringeskjer, nearly two-thirds of a cable from the south-west side of East Bagholm, and one-third of a cable northward from Kjobmandsholm. HundevaagOSen. \u2014 In Hundevaagosen, the channel between Hun devaagS and the northern part of HufterS, the depths are very irregular, varying from 32 to 116 fathoms, and there is no anchorage for large vessels. On the western side of the channel there are several sunken rocks and shoals ; the east side is clear. Tarangsvaag, about one mile northward East of Bagholm, on the east side of HundevaagS, would afford anchorage to vessels of moderate size in 11 to 12 fathoms, either balsa cable southward of Vaageskjer, the rock on the north side of the entrance, or at the inner end of the bight. Tarangsn\u00e6s, the point on the south side of the entrance, is foul to a distance of nearly half a cable ; and a shoal extends nearly one cable north-eastward from Vaageskjer. When entering the inner harbour vessels must keep close to the south shore, in order to avoid a rock with one foot over it, which lies nearly in mid-channel between the two anchor ages. About three-quarters of a mile northward of HufterS, there is anchorage for small craft between KamsS and the small islet to the northward, in 7 fathoms. KamsSflua, a rock carrying 6 feet, lies one cable N.E. by N. from the north-east point of KamsS. Korshavnsund. \u2014 Vessels may bring up in 14 fathoms off the entrance to the bight on the south-east side of KorshavnsS, but they should always be steadied out of the fairway by shore hawsers. Korshavnsstallen. a rock with 13 feet over it, lies one-third of a cable southward of the south-east point of KorshavnsS. There is anchorage in 11 fathoms between'Paavholm and Little Skorpa, two small islets westward of the north point of KorshavnsS, but it is only suitable for very small vessels. Stolmesund, between Stolmen and SelbjSrnsS, is a good and safe passage either to or from Bergen's Lead. Staldflue, a rock carrying 6 fathoms, lies 8 cables E. by N. 5 N. from Furens beacon, and about the same^ distance S.W. by W. from Vaageholm, the islet on the west side of the entrance to Stolmesund. Vaageflue, which also carries 6 fathoms, lies 3i cables S.W. by W. \\ W. from Bjornen, the southernmost islet offjhe entrance to Stolmevaag. Bjdrneflue, a rock with 15 feet over it, lies one cable S.E. i E. from BjSrnen. Gaasen\u00e6sbo, three-quarters of a cable E. \\ N. from the point north ward ot Vaageholm, is always awash, and is nuuked^by an iron pole.

The point on the east side of the entrance to Stolmesund is foul to a distance of nearly half a cable. Stuteflue, a rock carrying 14 feet, lies nearly in mid-channel between Valhammer and the West Vaholm, at the north end of Stolmesund, and is marked by a staff and broom. Fjordeflue, about 4 cables N.N.E. from West Vaholm, carries 3 fathoms, and is also marked by a staff and broom. LunddkalVStallen carries 9 feet, and lies three-quarters of a cable westward of LundSkalv. Kallsoflue, about 3 cables E.S.E. from the rocks eastward of Little KallsS, carries 8 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom. Little Grdnningen. \u2014 A shoal extends half a cable S.S.E. from Little GrSnningen, a small islet nearly one mile northward of GrSnningen. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Having entered SelbjSrns fiord, open Stolme sund, and steer for the entrance ; proceed in mid-channel through the sound till past the north-western extreme of SelbjSrnsS, then bring the latter point in line with SlotterS lighthouse, which will lead eastward of Stuteflue and westward of Fjordeflue, and continue with these marks on till past Stallareskjer. Vessels may also pass westward of Stuteflue by keeping close in to Kalhammer. When well past Stallareskjer, steer for Little GrSnningen, aud after passing on either side of that islet and Store FladS, at a distance of one to 2 cables, course may be altered for Pirholm. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Stolmevaag, on the west side of the entrance t j Stolmesund, is a small and indifferent harbour, only available for vessels of 10 feet draught at the outside. Southerly gales send in a very heavy sea. At the inner end of the bight there is good anchorage for very small vessels. Mdllen. \u2014 If necessary, vessels might bring up to wait wind or tide in the bight at MSllen on the east side of Stolmen, in 10 fathoms. Salthellen. \u2014 Vessels of considerable burthen might anchor between the Salthelle holms and the north-west side of SelbjSrnsS, in 11 to 13 fathoms. The anchor must not be dropped before East Vaholm is in line with West Salthelle holm, and shore hawsers should be laid out to the rings. There is also a fair roadstead between the Salthelle holms and Vaholms. The best position for heavy vessels is in 7 to 11 fathoms, with Stallareskjer just visible eastward of West Vaholm. Kvalevaag, half a mile westward of Vaihammer has a depth of 1 1 fathoms, but is only available for small vessels, and north-westerly gales send in a considerable swell."], [156, "138 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. V. Hevrd. \u2014 Between HevrS and Buholm, three-quarters of a mile N.N.W. from Kvalevaag, there is a small anchorage with a depth of 6 fathoms. A rock with 6 feet over it lies three-quarters of a cable N.N.E. from the east point of Buholm. Stallareskjer. \u2014 Vessels might bring up during a calm in 6 fathoms one cable N.E. from Stallareskjer. A shoal spit with 6 feet over it extends three-quarters of a cable N.N.W., and one quarter of a cable N.E. from Stallareskjer. Little Kallsd. \u2014 There is a small but secure harbour between the east side of Little KallsS and the Varholms, about one mile northward of Stallareskjer. The anchorage, which is bordered by shoals to the north ward and southward, includes an area of about 12 acres, and has a depth of 11 fathoms. The entrance is southward and westward of the rocks off the Varholms and eastward of a shoal spit carrying 2 feet, which extends nearly one cable S.S.E. from the small rock in the middle of the sound. Hestholmsund is a small anchorage between Hestholm and Blegen off the north-east point of Little KallsS. Small craft may anchor close to the west side of Hestholm in 7 fathoms, and run out a hawser to Blegen. Vessels of moderate size must bring up southward ofthe sound in 11 fathoms. Shoals extend nearly half a cable S.W. and North from Blegen. FROM SEAWARD. \u2014 Skolte fiord and MSgster fiord are good passages to Bergen's Lead from seaward, but it is unadvisable for strangers to attempt any of the entrances between SelbjSrns fiord and Kors fiord without a pilot. LANDMARKS. \u2014 On nearing the islands between SelbjSrns fiord and Kors fiord, Vikefjeld, the southern extreme of the high land on HufterS, will be readily recognised. Maagsten, an islet about half-wray between Furens and Marsten, is conspicuous from its isolated position, and is a good mark for the entrance to Skolte fiord. DANGERS. \u2014 Iu rough weather, or even with a moderate breeze, the sea breaks on the outer dangers between Furens and Marsten, and they are all within a mile of the outer islets. Marks. \u2014 SlotterS lighthouse bearing S. E., or Marsten bearing N.N.E. \u00a3 E., will lead westward of all the above dangers. SKOLTE FIORD. \u2014 The entrance to Skolte fiord is 4\u00a3 miles northward of Furens, between Maagsten and SlotterS. Vikefjeld bearing E.S.E. will lead in from seaward through Skolte fiord and between Little KallsS and HevrS, and when SlotterS lighthouse is visible through Stolmesund, course may be altered for Little GrSnningen. When the passage between MSgster and Little KallsS is to be taken,"], [157, "CHAP. V.] HEVRO \u2014 MOGSTER FIORD. 139 give the rocks southward of Maagsten a berth of 2 cables, and steer for the north point of Rosmund, the island west of Little KallsS. West AakerSflue carries 7 fathoms, and lies 6 cables westward of the south-west point of AakerS ; South AakerSflue, carrying 4 [fathoms, lies 2 cables southward of the same point ; and a shoal extends nearly half a cable northward from MSgster-GrSnning, an islet half a mile E.N.E. from Little KallsS. Keep Vikefjeld southward of Little KallsS until Marsten lighthouse is in line with Myrb\u00e6rholm, N. A E., in order to clear West AakerSflue ; and proceed with the north point of MSgster-GrSnning half-way between Little KallsS and UtelS, a small islet in the middle of the sound between Little KallsS and RisS, bearing E. by N. 1 N. ; then give MSgster-GrSnning a berth of one cable, and steer for Pirholm. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 In the sound between LangS and the west side of MSgster, there is good anchorage for vessels of moderate size in 12 fathoms. The east side of LangS, and the south-west point of KuS, are foul to a short distance off-shore. Nostvaag, a creek on the south side of MSgster, affords good anchor age to small craft in 7 fathoms. A shoal extends a short distance from the west side of the small islet on the east side of the entrance. MOGSTER FIORD, between MSgster and Horge, is clear on the north side with the exception of a shoal extending nearly one cable from the rocks westward of Horgekalv. Little GrSnningen just open southward of Terneskjer, which lies 2 cables southward of Horge, leads northward of all the shoals off Kvitting and MSgster. Hysten lies ly1^ miles northward of Kvitting, and carries 12 fathoms ; Nordstall and Midstall, lying 9 and 7 cables N.N.E. from the same islet, carry 12 and 11 futhoms respectively; and all three break at intervals when there is a heavy sea outside. Anchorage. \u2014 Horgevaag, on the north-west side of Horge, has a depth of 12 fathoms, and is a good harbour for vessels not exceeding 12 feet draught, but southerly or easterly winds are required for leaving. A shoal extends two-thirds of a cable southward from Sv\u00e6rdsling, an islet 2 cables northward of Horgekalv. CHANNEL WESTWARD of HUNDEVAAGO.- There is a good channel to the westward of HundevaagS, which is o-enerally used by vessels bound to or from the west side of Sartoro (SotrS). There is anchorage at the north end of this channel between SpisS and NavS ; and also in Bakkesund. Haavigfltie, a patch carrying 6 feet, lies 2\u00a7 cables northward of the islets off the south-west side of HundevaagS, and is marked by a staff and broom."], [158, "140 ESPEV\u00c6R TO KORS FIORD. [chap. v. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 If coming from the southward, pass about 2 cables eastward of Terneskjer, half a cable westward of Eiholm, and about three-quarters of a cable westward of Tr\u00e6tholm, taking care to avoid a rock off the east side of Horge, which lies about l\u00a3 cables northward of Eiholm, and is always awash. Give the west side of Svarteskjer a berth of at least half a cable ; and keep the north-west point of NavS well open to the eastward of SpisS, in order to clear a shoal extending nearly one cable from the south-east side of the latter. When past Arholm proceed in mid-channel between SpisS and NavS to Kors fiord. INNER FIORDS. Before continuing the description of Bergen's Lead it is necessary to describe the inner fiords to the eastward of StordSen and HufterS. These fiords are principally remarkable for great beauty of scenery ; there is also good fishing in many of the tributary streams ; and excellent sport is to be found in the neighbouring districts. SOUTH SIDE Of STORDOEN- \u2014 On the south side of StordSen there are two fair harbours. The southern of these, between EldS and StordSen, about 4 miles eastward of MSsterhavn, has a depth of 10 to 3 fathoms. The west side of the entrance is foul to a distance of nearly half a cable from the shore ; and a patch with one foot over it lies two-thirds of a cable N. |E. from the small islet in the middle ofthe sound between EldS and Kaarevig. Ndstvaag is a small bight, three-quarters of a mile north-eastward of EldS, where vessels of moderate size might bring up duriug fine weather in 5 fathoms. LERVIG,* a large bay on the south-east side of StordSen, would afford anchorage to vessels of any draught, but is open to the south-eastward. The best position for men of wariand other large vessels is on the west side of the bay, northward of the village, in 13 to 15 fathoms. Small vessels will find a good berth in the westernmost bight, off the south end of the village, in 7 fathoms, and the sound between HusS and StordSen has a depth of 5 fathoms. Between HusS and the church the bottom is rocky. There is also anchorage in 7 fathoms between the north points of YstS and MidtS. LIGHT. \u2014 From the south gable of a white stone building on the south point of MidtS, a fixed white light, elevated 47 feet, and visible 9 miles when bearing N.E. by E. through north and west to S.S.W., is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Shoals. \u2014 The following shoals must be avoided when entering or leaving Lervig. * See plan on Admiralty chart, No. 2,304 (in course of preparation)."], [159, "CHAP.

Skotteflue, a rock lying three-quarters of a cable from the south west side of the bay, with the church bearing N. by E. \\ E., is always awash, and has an iron pole on it. HUSO. \u2014 A shoal with 6 feet over it, extends S.W. one cable from the south-west point of HusS. Flseflue carries 3i fathoms, and lies 1\u00a3 cables N. by W. from the north-east point of YstS. A rock lying three-quarters of a cable N.W. by W. \\ W. from the same point has one foot over it, and is marked by an iron pole. Hystadflue and Lyrskjerflue are two rocks off the eastern entrance to Lervig ; the former lies one cable eastward of ValS, and the latter lies a short half cable eastward of Lyrskjer, off the north-east point of MidtS ; each carries 9 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom beacon. Marks. \u2014 Siggen, seen in the middle of the sound between ValS and MidtS, leads in from the eastward between Hystadflue and Lyrskjerflue. The north, west, aud south sides of MidtS are foul to a distance of one quarter of a cable. LANGENUEN is a deep clear fiord extending between StordSen and Tysn\u00e6sSen, past the eastern extreme of SelbjSrns fiord, and between HufterS and Reksteren ; it is about 23 miles long, has an average breadth of one mile, and as already mentioned, is, perhaps, the best of the passages connecting Bommel fiord and Kors fiord. When taking this channel, it must be remembered that baffling flaws, and during strong winds heavy squalls, occasionally sweep down from the high land on StordSen. The dangers in Langenuen are all within 2 cables of the shore. Tides. \u2014 In Langenuen the tidal streams set through to the northward when the tide is running out of Hardanger fiord, and southward when it is running in. Lervig. \u2014 The southern anchorage in Langenuen is at Lervig, a small bight on the west side of Huglen, 3 miles north-eastward from Leervig; small craft might also bring up for a time in 8 fathoms on the east side of the bight at RSdsbS, about 2 cables northward of Lervig. Lerflue, one cable S.W. by W. from the outer islet on the north side of Lervig, carries 3 feet, and is marked by an iron pole.

[chap, v- Mehammervig and Eidevig, about 4 miles northward of Kubholm, on the east side of StordSen, are two small bights which would afford temporary anchorage to small vessels in 5 to 6 fathoms. Sdreidsvaag, a deep inlet on the west side of Tysn\u00e6sSen, affords anchorage at several places. There are 5 fathoms in Oklandsvaag, a bight on the south side of the entrance, and 6 fathoms in LSvig, on the north east-side of N\u00e6sS. A rock carrying one fathom, lies one-third of a cable northward of the islets in the middle of the entrance to SSreidsvaag ; a shoal extends one cable from the east side of N\u00e6sS, and a rock carrying 2 fathoms lies half' a cable from the north-east point of the same island. Vesvig, situated 2\\ miles north-westward of SSreidsvaag, has a depth of 6 to 10 fathoms. A shoal extends one-third of a cable from the islet on the south side of the entrance, and is marked by an iron pole ; the rocks on the north side of the entrance are foul to a distance of nearly half a cable. Fserdsund. \u2014 There is anchorage for small craft at the east end of F\u00e6rosund, If miles northward of Vesvig, between F\u00e6rS and StordSen, in 4 fathoms. A rock carrying 6 feet, lies two-thirds of a cable eastward of the point on the north side of the entrance. Baardsund, the narrow passage between Tysn\u00e6sSen and Reksteren, has anchorage for small craft in Melkevig, the south-western bight on the south side of Reksteren, in 5 fathoms. Ostre Vinsnesvaag, a bay on the east side of HufterS, 1^ miles northward of Kalsund, would afford anchorage to small craft close in shore ; but there are several sunken rocks round the Tobbeholms and Aarsholms, and also in the small bights round the bay itself. In the middle of Ostre Vinsnesvaag the depths vary from 16 to 37 fathoms. Kolbenshavn, a small bight westward of Blegen, 4\u00a3 miles north ward of the Tobbeholms, is only available for very small vessels, and cannot be left with northerly winds. Storebdvaag, half a mile north-west from Kolbenshavn, has good anchorage for small vessels in the bight on the north side of the entrance, in 7 fathoms. Kummeld. \u2014 There is good anchorage for large vessels to the south westward of KummelS, half a mile N.E. from StorebSvaag. The anchor may be dropped in 17 fathoms, about one cable northward of LambS, and shore hawsers should be laid out to KummelS. There is a food channel to o the westward of KummelS and Ospo.

Between Huftero and Tr\u00e6lso. \u2014 There is a fair passage from Langenuen to Korshavnsund between Huftero and GrSnningen, an islet half a mile westward of Tr\u00e6lsS."], [161, "143 CHAP. V.] SOREIDSVAAG \u2014 KLOSTER FIORD. The bight on the west side of Tr\u00e6lsS affords fair anchorage in 1 1 fathoms ; and there is a good harbour for small craft between StrengelS and Store LauerS ; the south side of the latter island is foul to a distance of two thirds of a cable. The harbours northward of Reksteren, between BjSrnetrynet and Lyse fiord, are described hereafter. AAL FIORD extends about 16 miles in a southerly direction from Titlesn\u00e6s, the point at the eastern extreme of BSmmel fiord ; it is deep, free from dangers for the most part, and has anchorage in numerous bights and small coves. BJOA FIORD, between the entrance to Aal fiord and Borgund island has several harbours for vessels of moderate size. S\u00e6bSvig, on the south-west side of Borgund, and the bights on the north and south sides of RomsS, being the most convenient. Olen Fiord. \u2014 From Bjoa fiord vessels may pass through Hougsund to the south-westward of RomsS and NautS, to Olen fiord, or Olenvaag, where there is anchorage almost throughout in from 22 to 4 fathoms. Etne Sund extends nearly 5 miles eastward from the entrance to Olen fiord, and has several good anchorages. Birken\u00e6sflue, carrying 3 feet, lies half a cable S.W. from Birken\u00e6s, the point on the north side of the entrance to Etne Sund, and is marked by an iron pole. SkonevigS fiord, between the south side of Halseno and the mainland, is connected with BSmmel fiord by the M\u00e6le and Bjoa fiords, and with Hardanger fiord by HSilandssund, the passage eastward of HalsenS.' The Matre and Aakre fiords are continuations of Skonevigs fiord to the north-eastward and eastward. All these fiords afford good anchorage at various places, and are mostly deep and free from dangers.

There is a bight on the north-east side where small vessels might bring up in from 4 to 6 fathoms, to wait wind or tide. HARDANGER FIORD\u2014 This grand inlet is, perhaps, the most beautiful of all the Norwegian fiords. Its various branches extend through districts abounding in game, and presenting a great diversity of magnificent scenery ; the climate is mild both in summer and winter. The VSrings-fos or fall, 900 feet high ; and the Folge-fond, a very im portant glacier-bearing snow field, which attains an elevation of over 5,000 feet,* are among the principal objects of interest in the Hardanger district. Farming, market gardening, but more especially j\u00e6gtf and boat building contribute principally to the prosperity enjoyed by the SSringer and Haringerne, the two classes into which the inhabitants of the district are divided. The Hardanger boats, though roughly built, are light aud sea worthy. The main branch of the Hardanger fiord is a continuation of BSmmel fiord, and extends, under various names, about 50 miles in a north-easterly direction from the entrance ; it then bifurcates, one branch, SSr fiord, extending 20 miles to the southward, the other Eid fiord, 15 miles to the eastward. There are also numerous smaller branches, all of which afford good anchorage. Hardanger fiord is for the most part free from dangers ; its shores are nearly everywhere steep to, and the depth in some parts is over 400 fathoms The entrance is between HalsenS and Huglen. Tides. \u2014 In settled weather the streams run out of Hardanger fiord to the south-westward, but during westerly gales their direction is reversed ; and at such times they often attain a velocity of 2 miles an hour. RugSSekflue, a rock carrying one foot, which lies 21 miles within the * Professor Forbes. t J\u00e6gts are vessels which carry the stockfish from the Lofotens and the coast to Bergen, where they are shipped again for their southern destinations. These vessels are the most quaint, antique-looking craft I have ever seen, having immense breadth of beam, with abrupt flat sterns, and prows standing half as high as the mast. The fish, besides being stowed below, are piled upon the deck in a square mass almost as high as the prow itself. The odour of such a fleet is most remarkable. They are rigged with one large square mainsail and a very dumpy topsail over that. They cannot be much addicted to high speed, but appear quite indifferent to any amount of sea, and if they struck upon a rock would probably rebound and go on ahead, as though nothing unusual had happened. The vessels of the old sea kings were doubtless such as these. In ships of scarcely greater tonnage, held together by wooden bolts, without chro nometers, quadrants, or even a compass, they crossed the Atlantic, discovered and traded with America, and colonised Greenland more than three hundred years before Columbus was born. \u2014 \" Through Norway with a Knapsack,\" pp. 146-7., by W.

Loksund, a narrow sound which separates Tysn\u00e6sSen from the main land, and connects the Hardanger and BjSrne fiords, is about 4 miles long, and has a depth of 7 to 12 fathoms in the narrowest part. There is anchorage in Loksund for small craft in several small bights. B jORNE FIORD, a large open fiord to the northward of Reksteren and Tysn\u00e6sSen, extends about 12 miles in an E.N.E. direction from the north end of Langenuen. Its average breadth is from 3 to 4 miles, and the depth varies from 100 to 300 fathoms. BjSrne fiord has several anchorages, amongst which the following are the best. Jersvigvaag, a bay on the north side of Tysn\u00e6sSen, has anchorage in from 3 to 8 fathoms. The highest peak of Tysn\u00e6ssaata, open to the southward of Tysn\u00e6s church, will lead in between the Jesling and Helgasten rocks, which lie on the west side of the entrance to the bay. GodOSUnd, one mile eastward of Jersvigvaag, has good anchorage for vessels of moderate size, opposite the trading station ; the depth is 8 fathoms, but the entrances are narrow. Storflue, about half-way between VesS and Store GodS ; a rock on the south side of the western entrance ; and a reef on the south side of the sound, about 4 cables eastward of the merchant's house, carry staff and broom beacons. Besides the above dangers, a reef with 6 feet over it extends one cable westward from Blegen, the rock off the south-western extreme of Store GodS. Strandvig, a village at the eastern extreme of the north shore of BjSrne fiord, has anchorage to the north-eastward of Knapholm, and also in Odnevig, a small bight about 2 cables farther eastward. Severeid Fiord, a small branch of BjSrne fiord, extends about 3 miles to the northward and eastward from Strandvig, and has anchorage on the east side of Mjaan\u00e6s in 12 fathoms. Fuse Fiord is a deep clean inlet, which, with its continuation Samnanger fiord extends 18 miles in a north-easterly direction from the north side of BjSrne fiord, and has several small harbours. Ekeland fiord and Aadlands fiord are branches of Fuse fiord. Between Bjdrnetryne and Lyse fiord.\u2014 There are several anchorages between BjSrnetrynet, the point on the west side of the entrance to Fuse fiord, and Skorpa, the island on the south side of the entrance to Lyse fiord, but with the exception of SundS they are only available for coasters and small craft, and the passages between the numerous islands and islets are narrow and intricate.

KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. Variation in 1880, 17\u00b0 20' W. KORS FIORD* is the nearest to Bergen of all the approaches from seaward, and is the northern of the main southern entrances to Bergen's Lead. From the entrance (which is about 1 1 miles northward of Furens), Kors fiord extends 6 miles to the eastward, and then opens out to the northward and southward ; it is about 1 J miles broad between SotrS ( SartorS) and the islands eastward of Marsten, and the main channel is perfectly clear. Where soundings have been obtained the depth averages over 250 fathoms, but in the south-eastern branch of the fiord no bottom was found at 338 fathoms. Landmarks. \u2014 When nearing the coast on the parallel of Kors fiord, the following landmarks may be distinguished in addition to those already mentioned (page 138). Vaaganipen, a lofty peak about 25 miles E. by S. from Marsten, resembles Tysn\u00e6ssaata, but will appear considera bly smaller. MSsnuken, a high hill with a round top and sloping sides, will be seen through the middle of the fiord to the southward of Lysehorn, which is much lower, and in clear weather Folgefond will be very con spicuous between Vaaganipen and Tysn\u00e6ssaata. Lyderhorn, the western most of the seven hills of Bergen, is also a conspicuous landmark ; it is a sugarloaf hill 1,300 feet high, and will be visible in clear weather to the northward of FSrresvet, the highest peak on the southern part of SotrS (SartorS). Marsten lighthouse is also a most useful guide for the entrance to Kors fiord. LIGHT. \u2014 Marsten, a small islet on the south side of the entrance to Kors fiord, was formerly markedly a stone beacon surmounted by a cross : in 1877, this beacon was replaced by a stone building with a tower, from which is exhibited at an elevation of 122 feet, a flashing red light, showing a flash of eight seconds duration every twenty seconds. The light should be visible in clear weather from a distance of 17 miles. DANGERS. \u2014 -Kors fiord is one of the deepest and cleanest fiords in Norway ; the following are the only dangers to be avoided when entering or leaving. MarstenS-grund, an 18-fathom patch, on which the sea breaks occasionally during heavy gales, lies 1\\ miles W. \\ S. from Marsten lighthouse. * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Norway, west coast, sheet I., Karmo to Bergen, No. 2 304 and Norway, west coast, sheet II., Bergen to Stav fiord, No. 2,291. K 2"], [166, "148 KORS FIORD TO HEI\u00c6ISO. [chap. VI. Marstens-bo, a rock lying 8 cables W. \u00a3 N. from the lighthouse, is always visible. Iversflue is a shoal spit carrying 8 feet, which extends about 1^ cables north-eastward from Little Marsten, a small islet between Marsten and Store KallsS. The east side of Little Marsten is foul to a distance of one-third of a cable, but the west side of Store KallsS is clear with the exception of a rock carrying 5 fathoms, which lies three-quarters of a cable westward of Barkjylpen\u00e6s, and a shoal which extends a short distance from the north-west point of the island. YsteskjerbO has 2 feet over it, and lies on the south-eastern extreme of a shoal extending one cable from Tsteskjer and FladS, off the southern extreme of SartorS. PILOTS. \u2014 When entering Kors fiord with a southerly wind, vessels should run close under the lee of Store KallsS, the north side of the island being quite clear, in order to pick up a pilot. Should the wind be northerly, it will be better to keep over on the north side of the fiord towards ToftS, from whence a pilot will come off. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When approaching the entrance to Kors fiord from the southward, the land on the south side of SelbjSrns fiord should be kept in sight to the westward of FuglS, the outermost of the islands between Furens and Marsten, until the north points of Store Kallso and Skorpa are well open to the northward of Marsten lighthouse, in order to clear Marstens-bo. In heavy weather, SlotterS lighthouse, or Brandasundssaata, should be kept in sight until Kors fiord is well open, in order to pass westward of Marstens-grund. When entering Kors fiord, give the south points of Texlen, Flesen, and ToftS a berth of at least one cable, and keep the north extreme of Korsn\u00e6s open to the southward of SartorS, in order to clear Ysteskjerbo. Marstens- Aalen. \u2014 If considered advisable to pass through Mars tens-Aalen, the passage between Little Marsten and Store KallsS, give FuglS and Maagsten a berth of about 2 miles, and bring FSrresvet in Une with the western extreme of Store KallsS. Keep the latter marks in line until Marsten lighthouse bears N.W., and proceed in mid-channel between Little Marsten and Store KallsS, giving the north-west extreme of the latter island a berth of at least one cable. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 In addition to Korshavn (page 136), the following anchorages are available for vessels passing through Kors fiord. Bakkesund, on the east side of Store Kallso, is a small but sheltered harbour, which has a depth of from 14 to 18 fathoms, and is well provided with mooring rings. The best position for vessels of moderate size is"], [167, "CHAP. VI.] KORS FIORD, DIRECTIONS. 149 between Kvalo and the north-west point of SpisS. Small craft may anchor at the north end of the sound, but in the southern parts there are only 9 to 10 feet at low water. Men-of-war and large vessels generally bring up between Navo and the north end of SpisS, and run out shore hawsers to the rings. There is more room here, but the ground slopes from a depth of 8 fathoms on the west side of the sound to 25 fathoms on the east side. Vestflue, a rock with 4 fathoms over it, lies three-quarters of a cable N.W. by N. i N. from the north extreme of West Fluholm, the northern most of the islets between Store KallsS and Navo, and Osteflue, which carries 3 fathoms, lies one cable N.E. from the same point. Aspeflue, a rock carrying 2 fathoms, which is marked by a staff and broom beacon, lies westward of the middle of West Fluholm, and three quarters of a cable from Store Kallso. KvalSsten, three-quarters of a cable south of West Fluholm, and about two-thirds of a cable N.E. from Kvalo, carries 9 feet, and is also marked by a staff and broom. Vessels may pass on either side of West Fluholm, or between East Fluholm and Gule rocks, according to circumstances. Fugldhavn, between FuglS and Store VardS, on the north side of the entrance to Kors fiord, will be found very convenient when waiting for a change of wind. It has room for the heaviest vessels in from 7 to 1 1 fathoms, over a clean bottom, and is easy of ingress and egress ; but some swell is felt during north-west gales. When entering from the south-eastward keep the sound open between Store and Little VardS, in order to clear the rocks off the north-east point of FuglS, and the north-west point of Naro, and bring up opposite one of the mooring rings as most convenient. The western entrance is southward of Rosmund and the rocks off Little VardS, and northward of the north Oddene and Little FuglS. When taking the latter passage, care must be taken to avoid Rosmundflue, which carries 5 fathoms, and lies A\\ cables W.N.W. from the south-west point of Rosmund. Humlesund, between ToftS and the north point of VigsS, is a gopd harbour for small craft, and has a depth of 9 fathoms. The entrance, between Naro and VigsS, is free from dangers. Vessels of 6 feet draught may pass eastward of Flesen and Vigso, keeping close in to the east side of the latter, and bring up in the inner bight, eastward of the small islet at the east end of Humlesund. Klepholm. \u2014 Small vessels might bring up in from 8 to 10 fathoms between Klepholm and the south-east side of SotrS (SartorS)."], [168, "150 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [OHAr. vi- BERGEN'S LEAD. The various channels forming the southern portion of Bergen's Lead unite at the eastern end of Kors fiord, from whence to Bergen the distance is about 17 miles. After passing through LeerSovsen, the channel west ward of LeerS, large vessels usually proceed eastward of BjSrS, and through the VatlestrSm ; but there is also a good channel between BjSrS, and SartorS. There is a greater distance between the anchorages in the former channel, but it is rather wider, and the current is somewhat less violent. The western channel is more generally taken by vessels coming from Bergen, and bound to sea through Kors fiord. Small craft may pass through Bukken harbour, between LeerS and Bj\u00e6lkerS, but the passage is narrow and intricate. Tides. \u2014 Between Kors fiord and Bergen the tidal streams are everywhere very strong, but attain their greatest velocity in the Vatle strSm. It is high water in the VatlestrSm at 12 h. three days after [full and change. Between Bergen harbour and the south-eastern extreme of Asko, there sailing vessels often remain nearly immovable, during light winds,5 until the tide slackens. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 58 feet, is exhibited from a small wooden building on the north-west side of LerS. It is visible 8 miles, between the bearings of N. \\ W. through east and south to S.W. f S., and is shown from the 15th July to the 15th of May. LerS light is eclipsed in the direction of Rougnene ; the limits of the eclipse falling one cable westward, and half a cable eastward, of the rocks off Rougnen. The north-eastern limit of the light falls 40 yards westward of FladS. Vessels passing between Rougnen and FladS must keep within the sector of light. Beacon. \u2014 Rougnen, the largest islet of the cluster known as Rougnene, or the Rougns, which lies about half-way between LerS and the islets off the south extreme of BjSrS, has a white stone beacon on the summit. \u00a9ANGERS. \u2014 The principal dangers between Kors fiord and Bergen are marked by beacons. The following lie nearest the fairway : \u2014 Blia. \u2014 Shoals extend one cable W.N.W., and a short distance to the eastward, from Blia, a small rock well above water lying about 4 cables south-westward of Korsn\u00e6s. Between Blia and Korsn\u00e6s there are two rocks carrying 4 and 5 fathoms ; therefore, when beating to windward vessels should give Blia a good berth, and keep to the southward of it. Bom\u00e6s-tangen. \u2014 The east side of BSrn\u00e6stangen, a narrow tongue of land extending from the south-east side of SartorS, is foul a short distance to the eastward."], [169, "CHAP. VI.] bergen's lead. 151 Tangekulten, marked by staff and broom, is a spit with 2 feet over it, which extends two-thirds of a cable N.N.W. from the point north ward of LeerS lighthouse. Skjerholmflue or Spigeren, awash, and marked by an iron pole, lies 1 J cables north-eastward of Skjerholm, and 4 cables E.N.E. from the north extreme of LeerS. Rougneflue, marked by a staff and broom, carries 2 feet, and lies on the western extreme of a shoal extending two-thirds of a cable N.W. and west from the western Rougn rock. Sonsteholm. \u2014 Shoals extend half a cable to the north-eastward and southward from East SSnsteholm, the southernmost of the islets off BjSrS and TSsS. Alvdflue, a rock with 6 feet over it, lies one cable S.S.E. from AlvS. Skallen, a shoal patch to the southward of the rock off Flesland, eastward of AlvS, is marked by a staff and broom. Grundehavnsholm, about the middle of the east side of BjSrS is foul half a cable to the southward. Revskolten, a shoal extending 70 fathoms from the north-east side of BjSrS, to the northward of Jomfruhavn, is marked by a staff and broom. Vondeflua, 2 cables westward of the north point of BjSrS, carries 9 feet. Grundeflue has 9 feet over it, and lies a long cable N. by E. | E. from Fugleskjer, the north-eastern rock of the cluster off the south-east. side of Little SotrS. Shoals extend a short distance from the islets off Arrefiord and Kongshavn ; from the east side of Little SotrS (SartorS), to the southward of Bratholm ; and between Arrefiord and Knarrevik. Stangen, awash, and marked by an iron pillar, lies about half a cable westward of Stangu\u00e6s, the point at the north-eastern extreme of the passage between Little SotrS and the mainland. A spit with 6 feet over it extends one-third of a cable northward from Skaalevikn\u00e6s, about 3 cables westward of Kvarve point. Florvaagskj er, the southern rock off the south-eastern extreme of AskS, is foul about half a cable to the southward. DIRECTIONS through EASTERN CHANNEL\u2014 If bound to Bergen through LeerSovsen and the channel eastward of BjSrS, give BSrn\u00e6stangen a berth of about one cable, and keep nearly in mid channel between LerS and SotrS. When well past Tangekulten, steer for the west side of FladS, which may be passed within half a cable ; or, if considered advisable to pass westward of the Rougns, keep BSrn\u00e6stangen visible westward of Lero until Rougnen beacon bears S.E. S."], [170, "152 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [CHAP. VI. Give the islets southward of BjSrS, and the rock offFlesland, a fair berth, and do not approach Grundehavnsholm nearer than one cable. Keep rather on the north side of the passage when passing through the VatlestrSm, and proceed in mid-channel between Little SotrS and the mainland, edging to the westward when near Stangn\u00e6s, in order to pass westward of Stangen. From Stangn\u00e6s to Skaalevik the course is about E.N.E., and from the point Kvarven, or Kvarve point, to Nordn\u00e6s, the point on the west side of the entrance to the mercantile harbour of Bergen E. by S. \u00a3 S. 1^ miles. Change Of Wind. \u2014 A change of wind is frequently experienced southward of AskS in consequence of the windings of the coast, but as the land on either side is clean close to it is easy to beat up to Bergen if the tide is favourable. In the event of being becalmed, vessels may either bring up at one of the following anchorages, or run out shore hawsers to Hjelte-skjer or Kvarven, according to circumstances and position. \"WESTERN CHANNEL.\u2014 When entering the channel west ward of BjSrS from the southward, give the east side of Lunden\u00e6s a berth of about one cable, and keep nearly in mid-channel between the Lia holms and South Lid, where shoals extend about one-third of a cable off shore on either side. Give MSltholm and Haakj\u00e6rholm a fair berth ; and if turning through, do not stand to the eastward of a line joining the west points of NSltholm and the western Stenshohn. The south side of Kj\u00e6rringholm, a small islet lying a long cable north ward of the western Stensholm, is clean close to, but a shoal extends a short distance from the north side. Kj\u00e6rringholmskjer, about H cables westward of Kj\u00e6rringholm, and the same distance N.W. from Stensholm, is foul half a cable to the north eastward. After passing between Kj\u00e6rringholm and the Stensholms, the west and north sides of which are clean close to, vessels should keep, as nearly as possible, one cable eastward of the Kibergholms, the islets off the south east side of Little SotrS, in order to avoid the shoals which extend a short distance eastward from those islets, and at the same time avoid running on Vondeflua. When past Fugleskjer proceed according to foregoing directions. ANCHORAGE.\u2014 Between Kors fiord and Bergen are the follow ing anchorages and stopping-places ; \u2014 Bdrn\u00e6seide, the bight on the east side of BSrn\u00e6stangen, is some times used as a temporary anchorage ; it is exposed to southerly winds and the ground declines abruptly to the eastward. The anchor should be"], [171, "153 CHAP. VI.] WESTERN CHANNEL \u2014 BTJKKEN. dropped in from 17 to 20 fathoms, opposite the rings ; there is less water about half a cable from the shore, but the bottom is rocky. Klokkervik, one mile northward of BSrn\u00e6seide, has a depth of 4 fathoms, and is a snug little harbour for small craft. Seilbakken, on the south-west side of LerS, has a depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms, and is a good harbour for vessels bound either northward or southward. The entrance is between Visteholm, the islet north-westward of West BuerS, and the Brakholms. A rock, with 6 fathoms over it, lies 1-| cables west from the south-western extreme of West Buero, and the west side of Visteholm is foul one-third of a cable off shore. When drifting in a calm, vessels may also bring up for a time off the entrance to the sound between Visteholm and West BuerS, with the red roofed house on LerS, just visible westward of Visteholm, in from 8 to 9 fathoms. BUKKEN. \u2014 Bukken harbour is formed by a number of islets between LerS and Bj\u00e6lkerS ; of these\" islets the two southernmost are known as Store and Lille Bukken, and the islet where the merchant's house stands is named Buk van Raa ; the large islet between, and westward of Store Bukken and Buk van Raa, is known as Maro. The best place for large vessels is half-way between Store Bukken and Stangerholm, the islet southward of Buk van Raa, in 12 fathoms, but smaller vessels may anchor westward of Stangerholm in 8 fathoms, or east ward of Buk van Raa in 11 fathoms. The bottom consists of sand, with the exception of a rocky patch between the two first mentioned anchorages. Shore hawsers must always be laid out to the rings. Tides. \u2014 It is high water in Bukken harbour at 12 h. three days after full and change. The streams turn at high and low water, the flood setting northward and the ebb southward. Tr\u00e6sflue, half a cable N.E. from Store Bukken, carries 9 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom. Stangeflue, awash, and marked by an iron pole, lies half a cable S.S.E. from Stangerholm. Horsholm is foul nearly one cable to the southward and eastward, and shoals extend nearly half a cable from the south-east and north-east sides of West BuerS. When coming from the southward, vessels may pass on either side of Horsholm, and proceed in mid-channel between the Bukkens to the anchorage, or, if passing through, they may continue to the eastward of Stangerholm, Buk van Raa, and Espo, and westward of Stangeflue Bj\u00e6lSerS, and the rocks eastward of EspS. There are also passages east ward of Store Bukken, and westward of Maro. The best northern entrance"], [172, "154 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [chap. VI is between Buk van Raa and Bj\u00e6lkerS ; it is however unadvisable to attempt any of these passages without a pilot. Varholm and Esp6. \u2014 Vessels of moderate size may anchor between Varholm and EspS, about one mile northward of Bukken. FleslandSVaag, about 2 miles north-eastward of Rougnen, is a tolerably good harbour, even for large vessels. Between Fleslandsskjer, the rock on the west side of the anchorage and the mainland, there is a bar with 6 fathoms over it, from thence the ground declines rapidly to the southward, and in the middle of the bight there are 1 4 fathoms ; the bottom consists of sand. If coming from the northward it is advisable to drop the anchor about 10 fathoms under foot on the north side of the bar, and veer to the usual scope when the anchor takes the ground. The southern entrance between Skallen and the mainland is very narrow. Vessels using this anchorage should always moor with shore hawsers. Bjdrdhavn, nearly 2 miles northward of Fleslandsvaag, on the east side of BjSrS, has anchorage suitable for vessels going either north or but south, the depth is from 16 to 20 fathoms. The anchor should be let go in 20 fathoms, with Fleslandsskjer in line with the point on the south side of the anchorage, and about half-way between the latter point and Ringeskjer, which lies 2 cables to the north ward. Small vessels may anchor nearer the shore in 16 fathoms, or north ward of Ringeskjer in 8 fathoms. Here also vessels should make fast to the rings on shore, especially during westerly winds. Jomfruhavn. \u2014 When unable to stem the current in the VatlestrSm, vessels may bring up to wait for change of tide in Jomfruhavn, on the north-east side of BjSrS. There are 10 fathoms close in shore near the mooring ring, and from 14 to 16 fathoms farther out, with Flesland point in line with the north-eastern extreme of BjSrS. The bottom consists of clay. Bratholm. \u2014 Between the east side of Little SotrS and Bratholm, one mile N.N.W. from Revskolten, there is a small but convenient harbour. which is often used. The depth is from 4 to 8 fathoms. If entering from the southward, vessels must keep close to the south side of Bratholm. The north side of Bratholm is foul a short distance off shore. Alvdbugt has a depth of from 4 to 13 fathoms. The entrance is half a mile E.S.E. of Bratholm. Arre fiord. \u2014 There is good anchorage on the north side of the entrance to Arre fiord, half a mile northward of Bratholm, in 10 fathoms,"], [173, "155 CHAP. VI.] VARHOLM \u2014 BERGEN . A rock, with 2 fathoms over it, lies 40 yards from the land on the north side of the entrance. Knarrevik, a slight bend in the coast, half a mile northward of Arre fiord, has no anchoring ground, but hawsers may be made fast to the rings to prevent drifting. There are 12 fathoms close to the shore. DrotningSVik. \u2014 Vessels may bring'up in 9 fathoms to wait wind or tide, on the east side of Drotningsviksn\u00e6s, a point about 3 cables north eastward of Stangen. Kjdkkelvik, about half a mile westward of Kvarve point, has anchorage in 13 fathoms. Kvarven and Hjelteskjer. \u2014 There are mooring rings on Kvarve point, and also on Hjelteskjer, the rock off Hjelten\u00e6s, to which hawsers may be made fast to prevent drifting. Marikoven, a creek on the north-east side of Hjelten\u00e6s, the south western extreme of AskS, has good anchorage in 16 fathoms over a sandy bottom ; the water shoals to the northward to 6 fathoms. Marikoven is a good stopping place for heavy vessels. Strudshavn, half a mile north-eastward of Marikoven, is a good place to lay up in. The depth is about 10 fathoms, and there are numerous mooring rings ; but the entrance is extremely narrow, and northerly winds are required for leaving. Skarholm, one mile eastward of Hjelten\u00e6s, is a very convenient stopping place. There are mooring rings on both sides of the islet, and in the bight on the north-east side there are 9 fathoms over good holding ground. Sandvig, a creek 3 cables N.N.W. from Florvaagskjer, has a depth of 7 fathoms. BERGEN* is perhaps the most interesting city in Norway, and has many characteristic features peculiar to itself. It was founded in 1070 by King Olaf Kyrre, and in consequence of its advantageous position was for several hundred years the first commercial city in the country. The monopoly of trade formerly possessed by the merchants of the Hanseatic League was abolished in the last century, and the port was thrown open to foreigners ; since that time the trade of Bergen has increased steadily, and is now very considerable. The climate is mild, humid, and rainy, and the harbour only freezes in very severe winters. Bergen is beautifully situated on the shores of two small bays, which are compassed by seven lofty hills, and separated from each other by a tolerably high ridge surmounted by a fort, and terminating in the point Nordn\u00e6s. The town is very irregularly built, and having been partly destroyed by .See plan : \u2014Approaches to Bergen on Admiralty chart, No. 2,304 (in course of preparation)."], [174, "156 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [chap. VI fire and rebuilt at different periods, presents great architectural contrasts. In the older portion of the city, the houses are chiefly built of wood, with gables overlooking the streets, and are painted white, but those of more recent construction are of stone. When seen from the* fiord, the shores of which are dotted with pretty country houses, Bergen has a strikingly picturesque appearance. The principal shops are in the Strandgade, a long narrow street running parallel with the harbour, on the west side. At the inner end of the harbour is the fish market (Fisketow), which is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, from 8 to 10 a.m., and is one of the most curious sights of Bergen. On the east side of the harbour, between Walkendorff s tower and the fish market, is the Tydskebrygge or German wharf, the head quarters of the old Hanseatic merchants, and northward of Walkendorff 's tower is the Bergenhus or citadel. Among the principal public buildings are the exchange (BSrs) ; the bank (Kreditkassen) ; the hospital (Syg-huset) which stands at the north-west corner of the drill ground or Exercerpladsen, and the museum. There are also several private hospitals and banks, a theatre, library, picture gallery, &c, &c. Of the churches, St. Mari\u00e6 Kirke, which has been recently restored, is the oldest and most interesting. The population of Bergen in 1874 was about 33,000 ; the inhabitants are noted for their wit, intelligence, and industry. In*1872, the tonnage of vessels cleared inwards was 119,200 tons, and of vessels cleared outwards 130,200 tons. In the same year the sailing vessels belonging to the port represented 46,200 tons, and the steam vessels, 11,400 tons. The value ofthe imports in 1872 was 133,333/., and that of the exports 120,000/. The principal exports are stockfish, salted herrings, and cod liver oil ; large quantities of spawn and fish scales are also sent to the south of Europe to be used as bait in the Mediterranean sardine fisheries. The trade of Bergen with other parts of Norway is by no means so im portant as that with Nordland, and the arrival of the j\u00e6gts from the north in spring and summer occasions extraordinary bustle and activity in the port and on the quays ; the harbour is almost blocked by vessels of every description, and frequently the whole night is employed in trans porting, packing, and preparing goods. An English vice-consul is resident at Bergen. Supplies. \u2014 All kinds of supplies can be obtained at Bergen. Vessels in want of repairs can be accommodated, and there are several building slips and docks capable of receiving vessels of large draught. Water is supplied from floating tanks. There is also a good watering place at a mill stream in the north part of Sandvig. Time ball. \u2014 At mean noon, every Saturday, a time ball is dropped from the N.E. corner of the observatory. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Bergen at lh. 30m; springs rise 4 feet."], [175, "157 CHAP. VI.] BERGEN. LIGHT. \u2014 From a small lighthouse on the east end of the breakwater is exhibited a fixed red light, elevated 37 feet, and visible 4 miles in all directions from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The first anchorage to the eastward of Kvarve point (Kvarven) is in Laksevaag, a small creek on the west side of Puddefiord, in 3 to 6 fathoms. Puddefiord, the bay on the west side of Bergen, has a depth of 3 to 6 fathoms at the inner end. Sydn\u00e6sflue, of 2 fathoms, lies three-quarters of a cable westward of Sydn\u00e6s, on the east side of the fiord. There are several other shoals off Sydn\u00e6s, but they are marked by pole beacons. Lungegaard Vand, a lake on the south side of Bergen, is connected with Puddefiord by a channel over which is a drawbridge, and through[which vessels drawing 8 or 9 feet may pass when the sea is calm. Ndstet, a small bight on the west side of Nordn\u00e6s, has a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms between the shore and the NSsteflues, which carry 2 fathoms, and are marked by pole beacons. EASTWARD Of NORDN\u00c6S.*\u2014 Vessels may bring up tempo- rarily anywhere between Nordn\u00e6s and the breakwater, in 10 to 12 fathoms, but they will not be allowed to lie there. VAAGEN. \u2014 The mercantile harbour of Bergen is known as Vaagen (the Vaag or bay) ; it has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms over soft mud, and is protected from northerly winds by a small breakwater with a passage at either end. The eastern passage, between the lighthouse and the citadel, is one cable broad, and is most frequently used. A^shoal extends a long quarter of a cable from the Citadel point ; the outer extreme is marked by a staff and broom. The passage between the west end of the breakwater and the Custom House is only half a cable in breadth, and is generally used when warping in or out of the Vaag. There are mooring rings on the breakwater, and a warping buoy has been placed outside of it. The bustle of the merchant shipping, and the crowded state of the Vaag, render it inconvenient for vessels not having commercial business at Bergen ; yachts, however, frequently lie inside the breakwater, and moor with stern hawsers when making a short stay to complete stores, &c, but vessels of war generally use one or other of the two following anchorages : \u2014 PORT SAND VIGt *s a small harbour northward of an islet or holm in Sandvig, about half a mile northward of the Citadel point. * H.M.S. Black Eagle anchored here to complete coal and water. Remark hook of Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey, 1870. H.M.S. Racoon anchored southward of the city in 1864, and rode out a heavy gale from the S.W., the whole effect of which was borne by her sternfasts, and the mooring ring she was secured to. \u2014 Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Racoon, 1864. t See plan of Port Sandvig on Admiralty chart, No. 2,304."], [176, "158 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [cnAP. vi. The islet is covered with store houses, aud from a distance looks like part of the mainland. The depth is from 10 to 4 fathoms, and the bottom consists of sand and rough stones. Frigates and large merchant vessels will find this a fair harbour, but they must always moor with shore hawsers. Smaller vessels may anchor between the islet and the shore in 5 fathoms, and moor head and stern. NYHAVN, about a mile northward of the citadel, has a depth of from 13 to 8 fathom. It is generally used by vessels of war. Between Port Sandvig and Nyhavn, there are 26 fathoms within 3 cables of the shore. The anchorage at Nyhavn is obstructed by two shoals carrying 2 and 3 fathoms, the outer of which lies 1^ cables E. by S. \\ S. from Hegren\u00e6s. CAUTION. \u2014 The regulations with respect to powder, lights, &c. are very stringent at Bergen. Vessels are not allowed to beat to windward inside the breakwater, but they may sail either iu or out of the Vaag wdth a fair wind. An English printed copy of the harbour regulations is always supplied by one of the harbour officials directly a vessel enters the port. CHANNELS leading to BERGEN\u2014 It has been deemed advisable to give a summary of the most important channels leading to Bergen, as it may be a useful reference. There is an almost continuous inshore route from the north end of J\u00e6deren (page 77) to Bergen, a distance of about 100 miles. The entrance between Lille Feisten and SSrskod or through Haastens fiord, (page 85), will lead through KvidsS fiord and across Skudesn\u00e6s fiord to Karmsund. A few miles northward of KarmS is the entrance to BSmmel fiord (page 115), whence vessels may pass through Stoksund and Nyleden, or Langenuen, to SelbjSrns fiord (page 131) ; and from thence through Bekkervig sund, Stolmesund, or Langenuen, to Kors fiord (page 147). The northern entrances are Feie fiord (page 171), and Feie Osen (page 162). INNER FIORDS.\u2014 Lyse Fiord, a large bay between Skorpa and Korsn\u00e6s, has several small harbours ; the two following are the most convenient : \u2014 SkotteSUnd, about one mile north-eastward of Skorpa, has a depth of from 6 to 11 fathoms. The entrance is between Hundeflue and Oumeskjer. Rishavn.\u2014 There is a small, but snug and convenient anchorage, in the sound between the Bulderholms, on the south-east side of Korsn\u00e6s. The depth is 1 1 fathoms. Inner Rishavn has a depth of 16 fathoms, and is not so easy of access. FANE FIORD extends about 3 miles E.N.E. from the north side of Korsn\u00e6s, and has anchorage for small craft in several small bights."], [177, "159 CHAP. VI.] CHANNELS LEADING TO BERGEN. There is a narrow passage to the eastward of Bj\u00e6lkerS, Store Kinn, and the Egholms, and between Lyngvos and Fladevos, by which vessels may pass from Fane fiord to Bergen's Lead. COAST. \u2014 The coast line of the islands, between Kors fiord and HellisS, trends nearly due north and south. Amongst these islands there are numerous small harbours which would afford refuge to passing vessels obliged to seek shelter. None of these however, are available for vessels of war or other heavy ships, though some of them might be used on an emergency. Between Store SotrS and Feie Osen, there are several channels leading into the North Lead from seaward, but they are narrow, and not easily made out. PILOTS. \u2014 The coast may be approached to within a mile of where the sea breaks, and a pilot will certainly come off from one or other of the islands if the weather permits. It is not advisable to venture in amongst the islands without the guidance of a pilot, if it can be avoided, most of the channels being narrow and intricate ; the currents also are very strong, especially with ebb tides ; but should the weather be such that pilots cannot come out, vessels should stand in for one of the larger openings, such as Kors fiord, Feie Osen, or Feie fiord, where a pilot will be able to got on board in smooth water. Caution. \u2014 Great attention must be paid to the set of the tides when off this part of the coast, especially in fine weather, when it must be borne in mind that the streams generally set right across the islands. If, there fore, there seems to be any probability of the wind falling light, a good offing should be secured in time. LANDMARKS. \u2014 From the offing Store SotrS has the appearance of being part of the mainland, no islets or small islands being distinguish able, which is not the case off any part of the coast further north. On nearing the land the island Lona, 10 miles northward of Kors fiord, will be easily recognised, being conspicuous from its height and isolated position. The high land on the southern part of AlgerS has a very jagged outline, appearing from the northward like the teeth of a saw ; the other mountains iu the vicinity are round in form. TurS is higher than the north end of SotrS, and is a conspicuous object. ToftS, or Toft-vikS is lower, and Toftovik, a large bay or opening between TurS and Ono, about 19 miles northward of Kors fiord, is easily made out. DANGERS. \u2014 The small islets and visible rocks off the coast of Store SotrS, and the islands to the northward, may all be approached within one mile, and in rough weather all the dangerous sunken rocks are indicated by breakers. When passing westward of the islands between Kors fiord and HellisS, it is however advisable to keep an offing of at least 2 miles, as it frequently happens that the tide sets strongly inshore."], [178, "160 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [chap. VI. EIDSBOE and RENSBOEN are two sunken rocks about half way between Lona and Toftovik. The sea breaks on Eidsboe, which carries 2 fathoms, with the slightest motion, but Rensboen carries 4 fathoms, and only breaks with a heavy sea. Marks. \u2014 Tellebur hill in line with the west side of Lona, bearing N. by W., will lead about one mile westward of Eidsboe and Rensboen. Gl\u00e6snSBS. \u2014 Between Nordo and Gl\u00e6sn\u00e6s, 3^ miles northward \\ of the entrance to Kors fiord, there is a small roadstead with a depth of 6 fathoms ; it is exposed to seaward, and the channel is too narrow for vessels to pass to the eastward. GlSBSVaag, on the south side of Gl\u00e6sn\u00e6s, is a good and secure road stead, with a depth of 7 to 9 fathoms, and may be left with northerly or easterly winds. The best entrance is through ToftSosen, the channel between ToftS and the islands to the westward. Golten. \u2014 On the south-east side of Golten there is a good safe har bour, with from 10 to 12 fathoms water, but northerly winds are required for leaving. Goltesten, off the north-west extreme of Golten, is a rock of small extent, but very lofty and conspicuous. Tellebur. \u2014 There is anchorage among the islands southward of Tellebur hill, l\u00a3 miles northward of Goltesten, in from 8 to 9 fathoms ; but it should only be resorted to in fine weather. About half a mile north ward of Tellebur there are 10 to 12 fathoms in the narrow channel between Nipen and Telle, but the entrance is difficult, and northerly winds are required for leaving. Rabenosen, about 2\\ miles northward of Tellebur, is a narrow sound with a depth of 12 fathoms. Small vessels would find this a _safe harbour. His6. \u2014 There is a small roadstead between Hiso and DueS, which has depth of 5 to 6 fathoms ; but it exposed to the swell in rough weather, and only small vessels can enter with safety. Laako. \u2014 On the south-west and south sides of LaakS there are small harbours which might be used on an emergency. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 There are passages both northward and southward of Lona, so that vessels might run in if necessary, and either heave-to to the eastward of that island or endeavour to make one of the anchorages off LaakS. As long as the mountain on the south end of AlgerS is seen above Lona, and is not visible to the southward of that island, the vessel will be northward of the sunken rock Storebo. The Ertn\u00e6s rocks which lie half a mile northward of Lona, kept westward of N.E. by N. will lead west ward of Storebo. The north side of Rauskjer may be approached to"], [179, "CHAP. VI.] GL\u00c6SN\u00c6S \u2014 RAUGNO SUND. 161 within half a cable. When taking the passage northward of Lona, vessels may pass close northward of the Ertn\u00e6s rocks. There is also a good channel between Nyving and Fladod. Algerd. \u2014 The west side of AlgerS is clean close-to, except for a short distance northward of Ildsn\u00e6s. Between the north side of AlgerS and KraakS, there is a harbour with from 6 to 10 fathoms water ; it is easy of access, but the swell is felt there in rough weather. Vessels should keep close in to AlgerS when entering. Buard. \u2014 In the sound between East and West BuarS, 4 miles north eastward of the Ertn\u00e6s rocks, there is good anchorage in 6 to 8 fathoms. The largest of the Ertn\u00e6s rocks bearing S.W. \u00a3 S. southerly, will lead to Sveksten, and when past the latter course may be altered for the south point of west BuarS. A rock, carrying 4 fathoms, lies one cable N.W. by W. from the north-western extreme of the latter island. Guldd. \u2014 About one mile northward of BuarS there is anchorage in 8 fathoms between the east side of Guldo and the small islet to the east ward, but it is only available for vessels that may have drifted inshore during a calm. MidtSO. \u2014 Vessels may anchor at the south end of the narrow sound between SotrS and MidtsS, in 18 fathoms over loose ground, but they will be exposed to the swell ; there is more shelter further in in 12 fathoms. Skjervikflue, a rock lying nearly in mid-channel off Skjervik, is marked by a staff and broom. The depth increases at both ends of the sound, and the tidal streams run very strongly through the various channels leading into it. There is also a fair harbour, with a depth of 10 fathoms, between the north point of MidtsS and ToftS. Vessels may pass from either of these anchorages to Hjelte fiord. RAUGNO SUND, between ToftS andRaugnS, is a narrow channel connecting Toftevik and Hjelte fiord. The depth in the sound is about 20 fathoms. Pilots may be expected from ToftS, the west side of which may be approached in safety. The Navreskjers are several rocks, above water, which lie about half a mile south-westward of NarS, on the north side of Toftevik ; they may be passed close-to on all sides. Vestre Kjsempen, awash, and marked by an iron pole, is the westernmost of the rocks off the west entrance to RaugnSsund. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If coming from the westward give the south point of NarS a good berth, and keep in mid-channel between Kista, the southernmost of the islets off the south-west point of RaugnS, and the next islet to the northward. When past BjSrno, the north side of which is clean K 740. L"], [180, "KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. 162 [CHAr. VI. close-to, keep over towards the south side of the sound, in order to avoid a shoal extending nearly one cable from the south side of RaugnS, and proceed in mid-channel for Hjelte fiord. TorstenSVik, on the south side of RaugnSsund, has anchorage in 7 fathoms. Ulvesund. \u2014 About 2 miles northward of Toftevik is the western entrance to Ulvesund, a narrow channel to the southward of UlvS and BlomS, and northward of OnS and RaugnS. Ulvesund is a good passage to Hjelte fiord from seaward, and has anchorage in from 10 to 12 fathoms at the east and west ends. KvalOSen. \u2014 There is anchorage in Kvalosen, between SkogsS and OSen, for which a vessel in distress might run, but the depth is 30 fathoms, shoaling gradually to 4 fathoms south of Bredvik. Strdmo Sund is divided into two passages by the islands which lie between OSen and AlvS ; there are good roadsteads in both channels, and between the west side of OSen and Herlev\u00e6r is a small harbour. AlVO. \u2014 There is a roadstead with a depth of 9 fathoms at H\u00e6gS, on the south side of AlvS, but it is much exposed to the swell. Alfheimsund, between Hj\u00e6rtS and the west side of AlvS, is more secure, but the entrances are extremely narrow. The channel eastward of Lango, half a mile north ward of Alfheimsund, would afford good shelter in 7 fathoms, with shallow water on both sides of the anchorage. Between Selld and HelliSO. \u2014 There are three anchorages in the group of small islands lying between SellS and HellisS. The best is that between Stakso and HennS, in 1 1 to 9 fathoms. A pilot may be expected from HennS, and the islets and rocks to the westward may all be approached to within 2 cables. Between OrsS and Vaholm, about one mile north-east ward of HennS, is a very small but convenient harbour, with a depth of 8 fathoms. The anchorage between NordS and Sulem is only suitable for very small vessels. FEIE OSEN, the principal northern entrance to Bergen, is a broad clear channel extending between Hjelte fiord and Feie fiord. It is about 10 miles long and 3 miles broad, and has a depth of from 90 to 240 fathoms. The entrance, between NordS and HellisS, is about 36 miles northward of Kors fiord. LANDMARKS. \u2014 In clear weather the mountains on the Sulen islands (page 167) will be a good guide when making the landabout FeieS. The north point of FeieS resembles a haycock, and so does Stakso, a small island southward of the entrance to Feie Osen, but the latter is much the higher and larger of the two. The lighthouse on HellisS, a small islet off the south-west point of FeieS, and the stone beacon on Holmengraa, 6 miles to the northward, are also useful landmarks."], [181, "CHAP. VI.] 163 FEIE OSEN \u2014 NORTH LEAD. LIGHT. \u2014 From HellisS lighthouse is exhibited, at an elevation of 1 50 feet, a fixed and flashing white light, showing a flash of twelve seconds duration, every minute. The flashes are visible 19 miles in clear weather, and the fixed light for a distance of 12 miles. The lighthouse, a circular iron tower 106 feet high, is painted red, with a white belt 24 feet broad. PILOTS* are stationed on HellisS and FeieS, but should the weather be too rough for them to come out they will board the vessel as soon as she gets into smoother water. DANGERS. \u2014 About three-quarters of a mile north-westward of NordS there are several rocks above and below 'water ; the sea breaks on the latter in rough weather. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 If bound for Bergen through Feie Osen, vessels may stand boldly in for HellisS light on an East bearing, and pass 2 or 3 cables southward of FeieS. If it is blowing hard they will then be able to heave-to in smooth water for a pilot ; or they may proceed for Sjelanger and the North Lead. From HellisS to Sjelanger the course is S.S.E., distance 11 miles. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 There are several small harbours amongst the slands on the east side of Feie Osen, but they are only suitable for coasters and small craft. Between the south points of HellisS and FeieS there is anchorage in 10 fathoms. Hjelmevaag and KjebOg. \u2014 Hjelmevaag, a small harbour on the north side of SellS, 6 miles southward of HellisS, has anchorage in from 14 to 8 fathoms eastward of the hill on Forhjelmen island. Kjeflue, a rocky patch with only one foot over it, lies nearly in the middle of the entrance, and a rock carrying 2 fathoms lies two-thirds of a cable northward of the point on the east side of the harbour. There is also anchorage for small vessels in Kjebog, a small creek on the east side of the latter point. NORTH LEAD. \u2014 The inner channels leading to Bergen from northward are generally termed the North Lead, to distinguish them from the Bergen's Lead. The passage most frequently used is that through HerlS fiord and By fiord, to the eastward of AskS. Hjelte fiord, on the west side of AskS, is a broader channel, but it is also longer, and there is always the probability of being becalmed to the southward of AskS. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, visible 9 miles between the bearings of S. \\ E. through east to N. by E. \\ E., is shown at an elevation of 56 feet from Sjelanger point, on the north-west side of Holseno. The * Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey, H.M.S. Black Eagle 1870. L 2"], [182, "164 KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. [chap. VI. lighthouse is a wooden building painted yellow, with a red roof, 30 feet high. The light is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Hunden, or the Dog, a rock lying 2 cables westward of Sjelanger point, is always awash, and marks the northern extreme of a shoal extending a long cable from the north point of AgnS. Katten, or the Cat, lies about one cable southward of Sjelanger point and is marked by an iron pillar. Naua, or Nauet, half a cable from the north point of YpsS, is also marked by an iron pillar. DIRECTIONS through HERLO FIORD\u2014 If coming from the northward give the Kv\u00e6rn rocks, which lie two-thirds of a mile N.W. by W. from Sjelanger point, a berth of about one cable ; and keep in mid-channel between Hunden and Katten. Proceed in mid-channel between AgnS and HolsenS, and when past Ringholm, the southernmost of the islets off AgnS, steer S.S.E. until the passage eastward of JacobsS and SkarvS is well open. Keep in mid-channel between JacobsS and the islet to the eastward, and also between the Paris holms and Nauet, the west side of which may be passed close to. When well past the north-west side of YpsS, course may be altered to the southward. The land on either side of HerlS fiord and By fiord may be approached to within one cable. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 There is anchorage between Ringholm and HolsenS in from 6 to 12 fathoms, and southward of the islet off the east side of JacobsS, in 6 fathoms. North-eastward of the islet off the south end of YpsS, there is good anchorage in 10 fathoms, but it is only suitable for southward bound vessels. Vessels going to the northward might anchor between the Berlands holms and AskS, but the entrances are very narrow. Three miles southward of BerlandsS, on the west side of the fiord, is a creek named Hannevik, off which vessels might bring up in 13 or 14 fathoms, over good holding ground. Flensberghavn, half a mile north-westward of Asken\u00e6s, has a depth of 15 fathoms, and is a convenient place to get under weigh from. Askehavn, a small creek half a mile southward of Asken\u00e6s, has anchorage in 5 fathoms. A shoal on the south side of the entrance is marked by an iron pole. Between StrSmsn\u00e6s and the islets to the eastward there is a good road stead with a depth of 7 to 10 fathoms. The next anchorage in By fiord to the southward is at Nyhavn, northward of Bergen. HJELTE FIORD is a fine open channel 16 miles long, and north ward of Lille SartorS has an average breadth of about 2 miles. The"], [183, "HERLO FIORD \u2014 HJELTE FIORD. CHAP. VI.] 165 depths vary considerably, ranging from 50 to 150 fathoms, and, generally speaking, the land on either side may be approached to within one cable. Hjelte fiord is the best passage for sailing vessels bound either to or from Bergen when the wind is foul, as there is more room for beating to windward. LANDMARKS.\u2014 The white church on the western slope of HerlS, a grassy island with a shingly beach, about 2 miles southward of Sjelanger lighthouse, is a useful object by which to determine a vessel's position when passing Hjelte fiord. Midtfiordbo, a shoal patch lying one mile westward of Sjelanger lighthouse, carries 3 feet, and is marked by an iron pillar. Herldflue, awash, and marked by an iron pillar, lies 1| cables from the south-west side of HerlS, off the entrance to HerlS Sund. Tr\u00e6tteflue, 3 cables S.W. f W. from the south point of Tr\u00e6tteS, carries 3 feet, and is also marked by an iron pillar. Tr\u00e6tteS is about 4| miles southward of HerlS. Sunken rock. \u2014 About If miles southward of Tr\u00e6tteflue is a rock carrying 9 feet, which lies 3 cables N.W. from the south-western extreme of KalsS, and 2 cables S.W. by W. W. from Kalven. FaBrdllue, one cable from the south side of F\u00e6rS, in the channel north-eastward of Lille SartorS, carries 2 fathoms, and is marked by a staff and broom. Lamholmsflue, one cable S.W. from Lamholm, and 2^ cables east ward of F\u00e6rSflue, is also marked by a staff and broom. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 When entering Hjelte fiord from the northward vessels should give the east side of AlvS, off which there are several sunken rocks, a berth of about 3 cables. After passing Midtfiordbo, there is nothing to fear beyond the dangers above mentioned, and they are all easily avoided. The land on the west side of Hjelte fiord may be approached anywhere to within one or 2 cables. Turning through.\u2014 When turning through Hjelte fiord in vessels of 12 feet draught and upwards, care must be taken not to stand to the eastward of a line joining the west points of HerlS and AgnS, as there are several sunken rocks in the shallow space between those islands, and shoals extend a considerable distance off the north side of HerlS. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 There are very few anchorages in Hjelte fiord, even for small vessels. Between the eastern point of AlvS and the western Skarholm is a very small roadstead, and vessels might also anchor for a time in the channel southward of StromS ; between LysS and the north point of BlomS ; in Uive Sund ; RaugnS Sund ; and between ToftSholm and the north side of ToftS."], [184, "KORS FIORD TO HELLISO. 166 [chap. VI. On the south-east side of ToftS there is a small cove with a depth of 10 to 12 fathoms. The anchorage at Bratholm, half a mile westward of F\u00e6ro, has a depth of from 20 to 14 fathoms; but vessels may ride here securely when steadied by shore hawsers. On the east side of Lamholm there is also a small roadstead ; and as already mentioned, there are mooring rings on Hjelteskjer. Herld Sund, between HerlS and AskS, is a narrow passage which connects Hjelte fiord and HerlS fiord, and is sometimes used in preference to the channel eastward of HerlS and AgnS. There are shoals on both sides of the passage at the east end, but that on the south side only extends a short distance off shore, and is generally indicated by ripplings and discoloured water. The best entrance from the westward is southward and eastward of HerlSflue, but vessels may also pass in mid-channel between that rock and HerlS. It is best to keep over on the south side of the sound when passing through, edging to the northward when near the east end. Small vessels may anchor in the middle of HerlS Sund in 5 fathoms. INNER FIORDS. Radd Fiord, between RadS and HolsenS, though connected with By fiord and Feie Osen is not considered as part of the North Lead, being seldom used by the coasters. The southern entrance is through Hagel sund, between FladSen and the mainland. Kv\u00e6rneflue, a rock- off the north point of FladSen, is marked by a pole beacon ; S\u00e6bSflue, half a mile south-westward of the entrance to S\u00e6bSvaag, is always awash ; and Blodflue, carrying 6 feet, lies nearly in mid-channel off the north entrance to the passage between BognS and RadS. Radd Sund, which leads from the southern part of RadS fiord, past the east side of RadS to Lygre fiord, is a narrow and intricate channel only used by the small fiord steam vessels and coasters. OSTER FIORD and SOR FIORD are two deep beautiful channels extending round OsterSen, a large island completely shut in by the mainland to the eastward of Bergen."], [185, "167 CHAPTER VII. HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. Variation in 1880. 18\u00b0 25' W. COAST.* \u2014 The coast line trends generally in a N.N.E. direction from FeieS, and continues to be fronted by islands and rocky islets. Tides. \u2014 Between Holmengraa and Stadt, a distance of about 80 miles, the ebb generally runs to the north-west, and the flood to the south-east, but the tidal streams are greatly influenced by the winds. Strict attention should be paid to the force and direction of the streams when bound for any particular inlet, or if obliged by contrary winds to stand off and on. Pilots. \u2014 Bueland and Utv\u00e6r are the best places to stand in for between HellisS and Alden, in order to procure a pilot. AspS is not in habited ; but at Gaasv\u00e6r inhabitants will be found who are sufficiently well acquainted with the coast to take charge of a vessel. Landmarks. \u2014 The islands between HellisS and Aldeu present several prominent landmarks, which may be distinguished from a long distance in the offing. The Sulen islands, on the north side of Sogne SSen, appear like a promontory, because the sounds between them are so narrow and crooked that they do not show at a distance. . Poldetind, a mountain on Indre or Inner Sulen, is very conspicuous ; it rises gradually from a base extending about three miles north and south, to a height of 1,938 feet. The Utv\u00e6r and other islands lying off Ydre or Outer Sulen are very low. On HusS, a small island at the south-eastern extreme of the Utv\u00e6r group, stands a church, painted brown, with a red roof and spire, which is visible 10 or 12 miles. On Alden, about 18 miles north-eastward from Utv\u00e6r, is a conspicuous mountain stretching east and west, which somewhat resembles a couching lion, and may be seen from a distance of 40 miles. It is rather hollowed in the centre, and rises to the eastward and westward ; the eastern extreme, 1,500 feet above the sea level, being the highest. Alden is at once seen to be an island. The islands westward of Alden will appear from most positions like a projecting and connected point. V\u00e6rS, the eastern most of this group, is very low, with two circular knolls on it resembling haycocks, one larger than the other. The cluster known as Bueland is * See Admiralty chart :\u2014 Norway, west coast, sheet II., Bergen to Stay fiord, No. 2,291."], [186, "168 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. VII formed by a number of small low islands, and extends about 6 miles westward from Alden. Tviberg, an island lying 1^ miles north-eastward of Alden, is very remarkable ; it resembles two hay-ricks, of which the westernmost is the larger and longer ; when seen from the westward they are in one. Alden and Tviberg are seldom obscured by fog. About half a mile east ward of Tviberg is the large island AtleS, which rises to a height of 2,200 feet, but appears from the offing to form part of the mainland. When nearing the land to the southward of Utv\u00e6r, the openings of Feie Fiord, Fens Fiord, and Sogne SSen, will be seen extending in different directions. HOLMENGRAA. \u2014 The islet of Holmengraa, 6 miles northward of HellisS lighthouse, is easily recognised. It lies farther out, and is considerably higher than any in the vicinity, and has a stone beacon on the summit. The outer rocks to the westward of Holmengraa may be passed at a distance of 2 cables. SVALE ROCKS.\u2014 The Stor and Smaa, or Great and Little Svale rocks on the north side of the entrance to Sogne SSen, form two small detached clusters, which may be passed on the north or south sides at a distance of 2 or 3 cables. SUNKEN ROCKS.\u2014 The Breiflues, two rocks carrying 6 and 7 fathoms, lie about 2\\ miles N. by W. from Holmengraa, with Poldetind visible southward of outer Sulen and over Tungeodden, the low point forming the south extreme of StensundS. Half a mile N.N.E. of the Breiflues is Breifluskallen, and 1 \\ miles S.W. from Stor Svale is Hammerskallen, on both of which there are 8 fathoms. The sea breaks occasionally on all these rocks, but only during heavy gales. CAUTION. \u2014 A vessel should not bring the South Svale rocks to bear northward of N.E. by E. before her position is quite certain. Holmetaaen and Lille Grund. \u2014 Holmetaaen, a rock carrying 6 feet, lies on the western extreme of a shoal extending 4 cables westward from the Nordholms, the northernmost islets of the Utv\u00e6r group. Lille grund, a patch with 4 fathoms over it, lies 6 cables W.S.W. from Nord holms, and is the outermost of the shoals between those islets and SvinS. The sea breaks generally on Holmetaaen, and frequently on Lillegrund. TAARNSKJER.\u2014 The Taarn or Tower rocks form a small cluster about half-way between the Nordholms and Gaasv\u00e6r, and are useful marks. SOGNEBOEN is a dangerous rock lying 1^ miles S.W. A S. from the Taarn rocks and 2 miles N.E. \u00b1 E. from the Nordholms. Sogneboen is nearly always awash, but there are several rocks within 2 cables of it carrying from 5 feet to 5 fathoms, on which the sea only breaks in rough weather."], [187, "HOLMENGRAA \u2014 STROM FIORD. 169 CHAP. VII.] The whole space eastward of Sogneboen and Taarnskjer, and between Outer Sulen and Gaasv\u00e6r, is studded with shoals and sunken rocks. Marks. \u2014 The summit of Poldetind, in line with the steep northern slope of Stokkevaagnaave, a peak on the north end of StensundS, bearing about E. by S., will lead between Sogneboen and the Nordholms; but these marks should not be used by strangers. HALSTEINBO carries 6 feet, and lies a short mile N.N.E. \u00a3 E. from the eastern Taarn rock. In line weather the sea only breaks occa sionally on Halsteinbo, but its position is always indicated by breakers in bad weather. Marks. \u2014 The Taarn rocks, in line with the south-western slope of the mountain on Outer Sulen, will lead westward of Halsteinbo ; a vessel will be eastward of it when the steep western slope of the mountain on Alden, is seen a little to the westward of the two round knolls on V\u00e6rS ; and the highest hillock on Gaasv\u00e6r in line with the south point of AspS leads northward. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The west side of FeieS, and the islets to the northward, may be approached to within one mile ; but allowance must always be made for the set of the tide. When standing in between FeieS and Utv\u00e6r, a good offing should be kept until the vessel's position is accurately determined. The west side of Utv\u00e6r may be approached to within a few cables of where the sea breaks. If nearing the land between Utv\u00e6r and Gaasv\u00e6r (which should if possible be avoided unless the weather is fine and clear, and the vessel well under command), great care must be taken to avoid Sogneboen, Halsteinbo, and the other dangers eastward of the Taarn rocks. The west and south-west sides of Bueland may be approached to within one mile. STROM FIORD is an open space between Utv\u00e6r and Outer Sulen ; it is about 4 miles long and one mile broad. Vessels in distress might pass northward of the Nordholms, or between Smaa Svale rocks and Engelskjer, giving the latter a berth of half a mile, and run into StrSm Fiord, where they could heave-to in comparatively smooth water to wait for a pilot. There are dangers on both sides of StrSm Fiord, but those off Outer Sulen are all within 2 cables of the shore, and those on the west side would be indicated by breakers in anything like rough weather. ANCHORAGE.\u2014 If compelled to seek shelter between HellisS and Alden, strangers should endeavour to make the entrance to one of the larger fiords, and run into smooth water to pick up a pilot."], [188, "170 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [CHAP. VII. The following are the most accessible harbours on the outer part of the coast, but none of them are suitable for large vessels ; the anchorages in the Inner Lead are described hereafter. \" Kv\u00e6rnd Sund, between Stor and Lille Kv\u00e6rnS, is a safe but very narrow anchorage. Shoals extend a short distance off shore on either side of the sound, and a rock carrying 6 feet, which is marked by a staff and broom, lies 7 cables N.W. by W. | W. from the beacon on Stor Kv\u00e6rnS. The sound must be kept well open when standing in. Beacon. \u2014 On the north-west point of Stor Kv\u00e6rnS, 5^ miles E. \\ S. from Stor Svale, stands a square stone beacon, which marks the south side of the entrance to Kv\u00e6rnS Sund. Noren. \u2014 About 4 miles northward of Kv\u00e6rnS Sund, between the east side of Outer Sulen and the small island Noren or Nora, there are two small harbours with a depth of 5 to 7 fathoms ; they are separated by a bar, which extends from the projecting point on the west side of Noren to the opposite shore. The northern anchorage is the best. Shoals extend one cable from the south and east extremes of Noren, but they are always awash. Beacons. \u2014 There is a square stone beacon on the north point of Noren ; and a rock carrying 2 feet, which lies off the south point of the islet to the northward, is marked by an iron pole. The eastern entrance to the north harbour is between these two beacons. Strom Fiord. \u2014 There is a good harbour for small vessels on the east side of StrSm Fiord, within the islets eastward of LegS, but the entrance is difficult. HUSO. \u2014 Eastward of the church on HusS there is also a small harbour, with a depth of 10 fathoms ; the bottom, which consists of clean sand, affords good holding ground, but the swell sets in heavily. UtVSBr. \u2014 Between two of the western Utv\u00e6r islets there is a place where a couple of small vessels might lie ; but it should only be resorted to by those acquainted with the locality. The northern entrance is between SkarS and Tussen, and there are passages both northward and southward of Bagholm. Gaasv\u00e6r. \u2014 A vessel might in case of necessity seek shelter on the east side of Gaasv\u00e6r, H miles south- west ward of AspS ; the small harbour is, however, exposed to a swell, and the entrance is narrow and difficult. Buskd. \u2014 Small vessels would find good shelter in the southern part of the narrow sound on the west side of BuskS, about 5 miles eastward of Gaasv\u00e6r. Bueland. \u2014 Between Lango and GyriS, two of the eastern islets of Bueland, is a small harbour with a depth of 7 fathoms. The entrances are extremely narrow."], [189, "CHAP. VII.] KV\u00c6RNO SUND \u2014 RONGLEV\u00c6R. 171 Aldevaag, on the south side of Alden, is a small but good harbour, with a depth of 3 to 8 fathoms. The south entrance is through Bue or AspS fiord. FEIE FIORD, the northern termination of the great inner channel leading to and from Bergen, is an open passage between FeieS and Rong lev\u00e6r. The entrance is northward of Holmengraa. Pilots may be obtained from FeieS and HellisS. MEFIORDBOEN, lies 2 miles E. by S. \u00a7 \u00a3&. from Holmengraa, and about one mile west from Grimeskjer, a round rock in the middle of the entrance to Fens fiord. Mefiordboen is always awash, and the sea breaks heavily on it if there is the least swell outside. Kraakeflue carries 3 fathoms, and lies 4 cables N.N.E. E. from Mefiordboen. Shoals extend about 2 cables off the western rocks and islets of Ronglev\u00e6r ; but the east side of FeieS is quite clear. The islets between FeieS and Holmengraa may be passed in safety at a distance of half a mile. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If bound through Feie fiord from the northward, give the western Utv\u00e6r islets a berth of at least one mile, and steer about S. by E., making due allowance for the set of the tide. When Stor Svale bears East, haul about half a point to the eastward, in order to clear Ham merskallen and the Breiflues ; Kvanskjer and the other islets on the north side of the entrance to Fens fiord may be passed at a distance of half a mile ; and Mefiordboen should be given a berth of at least 4 or 5 cables. From a position one mile eastward of Holmengraa, the course through Feie fiord is S. by E., distance 6 miles ; and when HellisS lighthouse bears West, course may be altered to about S. by W. Continue on the latter course until the lighthouse bears N.N.W., and proceed through Feie Osen for Sjellanger or Hjelte fiord according to circumstances. If approaching from the westward, vessels may pass about one mile to the westward and northward of Holmengraa, and proceed according to the above directions. Grisholmsund, half a mile northward of FeieS, has anchorage in 1 1 fathoms, but is exposed to a heavy swell in rough weather. Rognsvaag, a small harbour on the north side of FeieS, has a depth of 6 fathoms, but southerly winds are required for leaving. Sildevaag, a narrow creek on the east side of FeieS, has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms. Ronglev\u00e6r, the cluster of islets on the east side of Feie fiord, has two small harbours. The northernmost, between the south-east side of Ronglev\u00e6rS and Ramsholm, has a depth of 4 fathoms ; and south of the islet off the west point of KaarS there are 8 to 9 fathoms. The southern entrance to Ronglev\u00e6r is the best."], [190, "172 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vii. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 46 feet, is shown from Brat holm, a small islet three-quarters of a mile southward of Ronglev\u00e6rS. The lio-ht is visible 8 miles between the bearings of E. \\ S. through north and west to S. \u00a7 W. The former bearing falls southward of the rocks off Leikeskjer, and the latter falls eastward of Ronglev\u00e6rS and Rams holm. In order to mark the southern entrance, a red sector of light is shown between the bearings of N. by E. \\ E., and N.N.E. \\ E. The light is exhibited from the 15th of July to the 15th of May. Beacons. \u2014 A stone beacon on the west extreme of Senoksen, marks the east side of the southern entrance to Ronglev\u00e6r ; and two sunken rocks near Bratholm are maked by iron poles. At night. \u2014 To enter Ronglev\u00e6r from the southward at night, vessels may steer direct for the light, keeping within the red sector ; and pass close to the east point of Bratholm, which is clean close-to. FENS FIORD is a broad clear inlet extending nearly 25 miles in an E.S.E. and south-easterly direction. On the north side of the fiord, 7 miles south eastward of SandS, is the entrance to Mas fiord, which extends about 12 miles in a north- easterly direction. In Fens fiord the depth is everywhere very great, but anchorage may be found in several small creeks known to the pilots. There are several channels between the islands to the northward and southward of the western part of Fens fiord, which, though used by the smaller coasting steam vessels, are too narrow and intricate to be considered ship passages ; the tides also run through them with great velocity. The entrances to some of these passages are marked by stone beacons. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 A vessel might run into Fens fiord if necessary, passing northward of Holmengraa, Mefiordboen, Kraakeflue, and Grime skjer, and southward of HillersSflue (which carries 6 feet, and lies nearly half a mile southward of the west point of HillersS), and proceed for either of the following anchorages. Vikingvaag, a narrow creek about one mile northward of the south eastern extreme of BSrtn\u00e6sS, has anchorage for small vessels in 4 to 6 fathoms, bordered by shallow ground. The point on the south side of the entrance has a stonu beacon on it. Napsvaag,* a bay on the south-east side of MjSmenS, has good anchorage in 14 to 16 fathoms ; a shoal on the north side of the entrance is marked by a staff and broom. Skj\u00e6rgehavn. \u2014 Three miles northward of Napsvaag on the north western extreme of SandS, is Skj\u00e6rgehavn, one of the stations for the coasting steamers, where vessels might anchor if necessary in 25 fathoms. * H.M.S. Black Eagle anchored here in 1870. \u2014 Remark book of Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey."], [191, "CHAP. VII.] 173 FENS FIORD \u2014 SOGNE FIORD. A shoal, on the north side of the anchorage, is marked by an iron pillar. INNER CHANNELS.\u2014 Vessels may proceed from Fens fiord to Sogne SSen, through the passage between Rauting Kalv and the islands to the westward, amongst which there is anchorage for small craft ; or they may stand farther in and proceed through Uudelands Sund, between MjSmenS and SandS, and westward of Skj\u00e6rgehavn, Great VatsS, and HisS. When taking the former passage, care must be taken to avoid SalSflue and SalSbo, which lie westward of KversS and SalS, and are marked by staff and broom beacons ; there is also a rock with 2 fathoms over it, one cable eastward of Sogneoksen. Beacons. \u2014 There are two stone beacons on Rauting Kalv ; and one on the south-west end of SandS. SOGNE SOEN extends southward of the Sulen islands about 16 miles in an E.N.E. direction. It is from 1\u00b1 to 2\\ miles broad, and is free from dangers. The depth near the entrance is from 90 to 260 fathoms ; farther in it is much greater. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 In addition to the Noren and Kv\u00e6rvS Sund harbours, anchorages may be found in many of the sounds between the islands on either side of Sogne SSen, but they are too narrow to be used by large vessels under ordinary circumstances. SOGNE FIORD. \u2014 At the eastern end of Sogne SSen is the en trance to Sogne fiord, which extends from thence about 80 miles to the eastward. The largest valleys in the Alps are not so long as this great inlet, the innermost recesses of which are over 100 miles from the open sea ; at the same time it is hardly anywhere over 2 miles in breadth, and in many places is not so wide. The mountains on either side, except those nearest the sea, attain an elevation varying from 2,000 to over 5,000 feet.; heir summits are covered with snow all the year round, and their declivi ties are steep and precipitous, descending in many places almost perpen dicularly to the water's edge. On the north side of the fiord, near the inner end, is the great Justedals Br\u00e6, or snow plain, which produces some of the largest known glaciers iu Norway. Sogne fiord and its various branches abound in waterfalls and cas cades, and the scenery generally is grand but sombre. Seals are fre quently seen here ; wild fowl are plentiful ; there are salmon in all the tributary streams wherever they can get up ; and the surrounding districts afford good sport of various kinds. The principal branches are the Fj\u00e6rland, N\u00e6rS, Aurlands, Sogndals, and Lyster fiords."], [192, "174 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vii. In the N\u00e6rS fiord the scenery is grand beyond description ; the fiord is in many places barely 2 cables wide, and extends between perpendicular walls of rock, which rise on either side to a height of over 3,000 feet. This branch is not navigable in the spring, as the melting ofthe snow and ice on the mountains frequently causes fragments of rock, large enough to sink a passing vessel, to fall into the fiord beneath. From Gudvangen, at the inner end of N\u00e6rS fiord, there is a post road to Bergen and Hardanger. Sogne fiord is entirely free from dangers, and the depth is every where very great, varying in the main channel from about 500 to 660 fathoms. Pilots* for Sogne fiord may be obtained at Skj\u00e6rgehavn. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Considering its extent, Sogne fiord has very few anchorages, but at the heads of nearly all the branches there are banks formed by the deposit from the different rivers that flow into the fiord ; these banks consist generally of soft mud, which affords excellent holding ground. The following are the anchorages most frequently used, but there are besides numerous patches of ground on which vessels might bring up close inshore, all of which are known to the fiord pilots. Bd Fiord, about 5 miles within the entrance on the northern side, affords good anchorage off Lervik, and is a place of call for local steam vessels. In the entrance to this anchorage there is a shoal of 6 feet lying in the fairway.f Kvamsd. \u2014 Within the small island KvamsS, on the north side of Sogne fiord 40 miles from the entrance, is a small harbour with a depth of 5 to 1 0 fathoms. Immediately southward of the entrance the depth increases to 52 fathoms. Framn\u00e6s. \u2014 Off Framn\u00e6s, 3| miles E.N.E. from Molsn\u00e6s, the point eastward of KvamsS, there is anchorage in 10 fathoms with Vangsn\u00e6s church bearing S. f E., but the ground declines abruptly to the northward. A shoal extends nearly 2 cables from the north-west side of Framn\u00e6s. Esse or Ese Fiord. \u2014 On the west side of the entrance to Fj\u00e6rland fiord, 3\\ miles N.W. by N. from Framn\u00e6s, is the entrance to Ese fiord, which extends nearly 2 miles in a north-westerly direction with an average width of 2 to 3 cables. Ese fiord has good anchorage throughout in 7 to 9 fathoms. LERDALSOREN, at the inner end of Lerdals fiord is an insignificant little town from whence there is a post road to Kristiana. The population is about 800, and there is a telegraph station, <fec. here. * Remark book of Nav. Lieut. J. J. Covey, H.M.S. Black Eagle, 1870. f Norwegian Notice to Mariners, No. 11 of 1879."], [193, "SOGNE FIORD \u2014 DREVO SUND. 175 CHAP. VII.] There is very good anchorage northward of a white house with a pier and landing, in 11 to 24 fathoms over soft mud, but the depth increases rapidly to the northward. Aardals Fiord has several small patches of anchoring ground close inshore. Seven miles from the inner end of this fiord is the Vettis or Morka-fos, which has a perpendicular fall of nearly 1,000 feet. Lyster Fiord is the most beautiful of all the branches of Sogne fiord, and is a favourite yachting station. There is anchorage at Solvorn, Marifj\u00e6ren, near the outlet of Justedals river, and several other places. INNER LEAD. \u2014 The best of the channels between the Sulen islands are the Ytre or outer Stensund ; Krakhelle Sund ; and Tolle Sund. Dale Sund, and the Indre or inner Stensund, can only be taken by those thoroughly acquainted with the locality. OUTER STENSUND, between Outer Sulen and Ravn or Dale island, is a passage suitable for the largest vessels. It has also several anchorages. Beacons. \u2014 The southern entrance to Outer Stensund is marked by the Noren beacon ; and on the east side of the north entrance there is a stone beacon on Kraaka. Kraaka-flue or Stillebo, a sunken rock lying 3 cables S.S.W. from Kraaka, is marked by an iron pole. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When entering Outer Stensund from the south ward, pass about 3 cables eastward of Noren, and give the south point of DaleS a berth of one cable, passing nearly in mid-channel between the rocks on either side of the passage. Give the east side of Flato a berth of nearly 2 cables, and proceed east ward of InderS and the islets off Older Kalv, passing westward of Kraaka flue and Kraaka. The Plitten rocks should be passed within a distance of 3 or 4 cables, in order to clear the shoals off LaagSholm. GAASV\u00c6R OSEN, a broad passage between Gaasv\u00e6r and AspS, connects Outer Stensund with Bue fiord. When passing through Gaasv\u00e6r Osen, vessels must give the rocks northward of Gaasv\u00e6r a wide berth. BUE Or ASPO FIORD is a large open space to the southward of Bueland and V\u00e6rS. When entering Bue fiord from the southward vessels should give Gaasv\u00e6r a berth of 2 miles, and pass one mile north ward of AspS. They may then proceed between Gjeita and Bratholm, according to the directions for DrevS Sund. There is also a passage west ward of Lille Gjeitungen and the Skarholms. DREVO SUND, a narrow channel on the east side of ApsS, is the continuation to the northward ofthe Outer Stensund passage. There is also a channel between F\u00e6ro and BuskS, but it is seldom used."], [194, "176 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vii. Beacons. \u2014 On Havne holm, a small islet southward of AspS, is a yellow stone beacon with a staff on the top, which marks the west side of the entrance to DrevS Sund. A sunken rock to the eastward of DrevS Katten is marked by an iron pole, and Kvanskjerflue has a staff and broom on it. Stabben, a rock lying 4 cables S.W. by W. f W. from the western Kviting islet, and about half-way between V\u00e6rS and Aralden, is marked by an iron pillar. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From a position 3 cables E.S.E. from the eastern Plitten rock, the course to the south entrance to DrevS Sund is N.E. J E., distance 2\\ miles. Keep in mid-channel between AspS and the islets to the eastward ; pass one cable eastward of KjSnholm, and steer about N.N.E. \\ E. for the east point of Store Gjeitungen. When past the Svartskjer cluster, proceed between Gjeita and Bratholm, westward of Stabben, and eastward of the Skarholms, for the entrance to Aide fiord. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels taking the Stensund and DrevS Sund passage may bring up to wait wind or tide between FlatS and Ringholm, in Outer Stensund, in the narrow sound on the east side of Older Kalv ; and off the east side of AspS, about half a mile northward of the beacon on Havneholm. Dale Sund,* between Daleo and StensundSeu, is too narrow to be considered a ship passage, but has very fair anchorage about a mile north ward of the south-east point of Daleo. Indre or Inner Stensund, on the east side of StensundSen, though sometimes taken by the coasting steam vessels, is very narrow and intricate. On the eastern LaagS holm, at the west side of the north entrance, is a white stone beacon. KRAKHELLE SUND, between Inner Sulen and LosneS, is clear with the exception of a rocky patch lying nearly one cable southward ofthe projecting point on the west side of the south entrances. When taking this passage, vessels should pass eastward of the Seglstens, which lie on the west side of the sound, one mile southward ofthe north entrance. TOLLE SUND, between LosneS and SkorpS, is free from dangers ; but vessels must give a good berth to the Torsholms and the south-east side of LosneS, when entering from Sogne SSen. Skorpd Sund, on the east side of SkorpS, is a narrow channel leading from Sogne SSen to Aa fiord. Aa Fiord extends about 7 miles to the eastward from the north end of SkorpS Sund, and forms part of the boundary between the districts of Sogn and SSnd fiord. There is good anchorage in the northernmost of the * H.M.S.

VILN\u00c6S FIORD, a broad channel between the south side of Atleo and the mainland, leads from the Krakhelle and Tollesunds either to Dais Fiord, Grande Sund, or the passage westward of AtleS. Mdrpdlsa is a rock lying 4 cables W. \u00a3 S. from the west point of LangS, the islet on the south side of the entrance to Viln\u00e6s fiord. It is marked by an hon pillar, and the sea breaks heavily on it when there is any swell. Midtfiordskjer, three-quarters of a mile W. N. from MSrpSlsa, and the same distance south-eastward of Aralden, is marked by a black stone beacon with a cage on the top. Mdgelasset, a shoal patch lying 4 cables S.S.W. from Krokholm, at the eastern end of Viln\u00e6s fiord, is marked by an iron pillar. Flatdflue is a patch with 2 feet over it, lying 3 cables S.S.W. \\ W. from FlatS, an islet off the south-eastern extreme of AtleS. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 If bound through Viln\u00e6s fiord from Krakhelle Sund on Tolle Sund, give the rocks westward of SakrisS and Luten a berth of 2 or 3 cables ; proceed between Midtfiordskjer and MSrpSlsa, and steer about N. by E. i E. until the north points of Aralden and Lammetu bear about W.N.W. and E.S.E. Then haul to the eastward, and pass at least one cable southward of MSgelasset, and about half a mile southward of FlatS. The vessel will be past FlatSflue when the east side of FlatS bears North, and course may then be altered for Grande Sund or Dais fiord. There is also a passage leading westward of FlatSflue and FlatS to Grande Sund, but it is very narrow. When bound through the channel between Tviberg and Atleo, proceed as directed above, until well past MSrpSlsa, when course may be altered to pass between Aralden and RauS. GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 Between Bueland and Bremanger the outlying islands are generally of smaller size than on other parts of the west coast of Norway, and are interspersed with numerous shoals and sunken rocks extending about 15 miles from the mainland. It is therefore advisable to keep an offing of about 20 miles when passing, for though the dangers are generally indicated by breakers, and there are deep water channels between them, it must always be a difficult task for strangers to navigate such intricate passages in safety. f See Admiralty charts : \u2014Norway, west coast, sheets II. and III., Bergen to Stav fiord No. 2,291, and Stav fiord to Romsdals islands, No. 2,305. K 740. M"], [196, "178 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vn. Tides. \u2014 The general nature of the tides between Alden and Stadt has already been described (page 167) ; but in the various channels be tween the islands the force and direction of the streams vary considerably. Pilots. \u2014 Kinn is the best place to stand in for between Alden and Bremanger when the services of a pilot are required, but fishermen will generally be found on most of the outer islands. Landmarks. \u2014 The group of large lying 15 miles north ward of Alden stand out conspicuously from the mainland, which is generally lofty, irregular, and indented. Amongst these islands Kinn is especially prominent, having two mountains on it which are separated by a deep ravine with steep sides. The eastern mountain, 1,042 feet high, is the higher and larger. In the middle of the western mountain there is a similar cleft, but its sides are still more perpendicular and of nearly equal height, so that it looks as if a piece had been cutout of the summit. These mountains run in an oblique direction to each other, so that one or other of the clefts will be visible from seaward, except when due west of the island. The outer or western cleft is most conspicuous between the bearings of North and East, and the ravine between the mountains when bearing about S.E. There is no other island of this form on the whole coast, and it may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 30 or 40 miles. On the north side of Kinn is a white church with a red roof, which is visible at a distance of 8 miles. Blaakoll hill on Skorpen, 2\\ miles E.N.E. of Kinn, rises to a height of 1,300 feet. Batalden island, 1,600 feet high, lies northward of Skorpen, and is also a conspicuous mark. The large triangular island Bremanger, or Bremangerland, is very high, and appears from most positions to form part of the mainland. On the eastern extreme of Bremanger is Hornelen mountain. TEMPA BANK, the western edge of which bears W. by S. 10 miles from the western mountain on Kinn, and N.N.W. i W. 13| miles from the highest part of Alden, is about 2 miles long in a N.W. and S.E. direction, and about one mile broad. It carries a general depth of 30 to 40 fathoms, over rocks and weeds, but there are several steep patches on which the depths vary from 8 to 12 and 15 fathoms. About the edge of the bank the sea is very boisterous, and in bad weather has almost the appearance of breakers. Tempa bank lies outside all the dangers between Alden and Kinn, and if soundings could be obtained on it, they would verify a vessel's position. Fishing boats generally lie on this bank when the weather permits. Remmane are five rocks extending nearly one mile in a north and south direction to the northward of Bueland ; they carry from 4 to 8"], [197, "CHAP.

Nakken, the northernmost rock, on which there are 6 fathoms, bears W. by N. \\ N. from the highest part of Alden, and S.W. by W. \\ W. 1| miles from Fladskjer, the southernmost of the Haastens. HAASTENENE are a cluster of islets and rocks lying 1| miles northward of V\u00e6rS. HAASTENBOEN lies 1^ miles from Fladskjer, with that rock in line with the highest part of Alden, bearing S.E. by E. HaastengTUnd is a steep bank, extending about one mile northward and westward from Haastenboen ; the depths on it vary from 3 to 16 fathoms. The sea nearly always breaks on Haastenboen, which only just covers, and during westerly gales is short and heavy on Haastengrund, frequently breaking on the shoalest parts. Marks. \u2014 The northern extreme of Alden in line with the highest part of AtleS, bearing E. by S. \\ S., or well open southward of Fladskjer, will lead between Nakken and Haastenboen. Rygstenene form a straggling cluster of islets and rocks extending 5 miles in a W. by N. direction from Molv\u00e6r, a fishing station 2} miles northward from Tviberg. The Rygstens are separated from the Haastens by a channel \\\\ miles broad. GARBO SKJERS. \u2014 This dangerous group of detached rocks lying about 2 miles north-westward from the outer Rygstens, are almost always indicated by breakers. SSveirsskallen, a patch with 8 fathoms over it, lies W. \\ S. 1\\ miles from Langfaldet, the southernmost of the Garbo Skjers. Teinegrund, Ostn\u00e6sflue, and Herlandsbotten, patches carrying from 8 to 10 fathoms, lie about W.N.W. 2 miles from Gauteboen and Storboen, the westernmost of the Garbo Skjers. Marks. \u2014 Should it be necessary to stand close in when beating to windward off this part of the coast, or in order to take a pilot on board, strict attention must be paid to the following marks : \u2014 The southern Rygsten, kept northward of the high land on Staven\u00e6s, bearing about E. \\ S., leads southward of Langfaldet. The north-east side of Tviberg in line with the highest Rygsten, bearing about S.E., will lead northward of Storboen and the north Garboen Skjer, and southward of Gunnarskjer. There are no good marks for clearing the Garbo Skjers on the west side, but Alden and Kinn cannot be mistaken ; cross bearings of these islands, with the extreme of Bueland when it can be made out, will determine the vessel's position.

A bank carrying 10 to 20 fathoms extends 2| miles in a north-westerly direction from the RSrings, and is indicated by a heavy sea in bad weather. Blegnsflue, a rock near the western edge of the bank, carries 6 fathoms ; and RSringsflue, on which the sea generally breaks, lies N.E. by E. | E. three-quarters of a mile from Blegnen, and N.W. \\ W. nearly one mile from the western RSring. lS' JONSGRUNDFALDENE form a bank composed of several shoal patches ; the body of the bank lies about N. by W. \\ W. 3 miles from the RSrings. It carries a depth of 3 to 8 fathoms, and is also indicated by a heavy sea in bad weather. Jonsgrund, a small bank similar to the last, from which it bears about N.N.W. 1\\ miles, carries 10 to 13 fathoms. Marks. \u2014 The southern extreme of the islet off the south side of Kinn, in line with the hill on the east end of Reksten, will lead between Jonsgrund faldene and Jonsgrund. HAABOERNE and SKOTTEN.\u2014 The easternmost of these rocks is indicated by breakers, and lies W. by N. \\ N. three-quarters of a mile from Store Svartskjer, the southernmost of the islets to the north-westward of Kinn. The western rocks carry 2 to 9 fathoms, and lie N.W. by W. three-quarters of a mile from the north Haabo. Lighthouse. \u2014 A lighthouse is in course of construction on YtterS, \\\\ miles north-west of Kinn. TYSKERFALDENE are two rocks carrying 4 feet; the southern rock bears W. \\ N. 1^ miles from Sverslingerne, a cluster of rocky islets lying N.W. 3 miles from the north point of Kinn, and one mile northward of the YtterS group.

GARBOERNE are several dangerous rocks lying N. by E. \\ E. 11 miles from Sverslingerne. The shoal patches in the space between Tyskerfaldene, Garboerne, and Sverslingerne form an irregular bank, on which there are several sunken rocks ; but the sea nearly always breaks on those that are dangerous.

Kvitingfaldet is a cluster of sunken rocks, extending nearly one mile westward from Kvitingerne. SENDINGERNE. \u2014 These rocks form a small detached cluster lying W.N.W. 6 miles from Batalden ; they are moderately high, and as there are several shoal patches in their vicinity, should be given a berth of 2 miles. STEVNESKJER lies about half-way between Sendingerne and Batalden, and is also moderately high. STEVNESKJERBOERNE are four dangerous rocks bearing about N.W. by W. distant one mile from Stevneskjer. STEVNESKJERFLUE carries 4 fathoms, and lies N.N.W. 1| miles from Stevneskjer, on the north-eastern extreme of a bank formed by the shoal patches known as Smaaboerne, which carry 4 to 8 fathoms. ARALDEN is a very conspicuous rock lying about one mile north ward of Batalden. A bank, carrying a depth of 4 to 14 fathoms, extends from Aralden about three-quarters of a mile to the northward and west ward. Within 3 cables of Aralden there are several dangerous sunken rocks. DANGERS OFF FRO JEN.\u2014 The sea breaks on nearly all the rocks lying westward of FrSjen, an island off the south-west side of Bremanger, and many of them are visible above water. Ysteboen lies S.W. 2f miles from Mulen, the north-west point of FrSjen ; and the same distance W.N.W. from Thorshovden, the southern ex treme of the same island. Taddeskjer, a small rock above water, lies S. -\\ E. 1| miles from Ysteboen ; and Djupsundkubberne, several small rocks which are also visible, lie W.S.W. nearly 1J miles from the south extreme of GaasS, the largest of the islets on the north side of the entrance to FrSisSen. The whole space between the above rocks and the west side of FrSjen is studded with rocks and shoals. NOREFLUE is a 4 fathom patch lying W. \\ S. nearly 7 miles from N\u00e6sje, the north extreme of FrSjen, and N.W. by W. \\ W. 6\u00a3 miles from Thorshovden. Between NSreflue and Djupsundkubberne there are several banks and shoals carrying from 4 to 18 fathoms, therefore it is advisable to give the west side of FrSjen a berth of at least 8 miles. MARKS. \u2014 Blaakoll hill on Skorpen, open westward of Batalden, will lead westward of NSreflue. The western extreme of Stadtlandet, bearing N.E. \\ E. ; or the western extreme of VaagsS, well open westward of Bremanger, are also good marks for passing westward of the dangers off FrSjen."], [200, "182 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vii. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Only those who are well acquainted with the leading marks should venture in amongst the rocks and shoals lying south ward of FrSj SSen without a pilot, as there are numerous dangers between those already described and the mainland,! and no marks can be given which would be intelligible to a stranger. Therefore, as already observed it is better to give this part of the coast a wide berth. Should it, however, be necessary to seek shelter before a pilot can get on board, the best harbours to run for are Aldevaag, HelgS, Kinn Sund, Batalden, SmSrhavn, and Bremangen Poll ; strangers are recommended not to attempt even these, unless they are quite certain of their position. ALDEVAAG. \u2014 The anchorage in Aldevaag measures about one cable every way, and there are two passages leading to it from the northward, viz., Aide Fiord and V\u00e6rS Sund ; the former 'is preferable with northerly winds on account of the small island lying off the entrance to the harbour. The entrance is barely two thirds of a cable wide, and a rock lies nearly in mid-channel between the point on the east side, and the north-east side of the islet to the westward. Aide Fiord, the channel between Alden and Tviberg, is about 1T2T miles wide, and may be entered without difficulty in tolerably clear weather. Trolleflue has 6 fathoms over it, and lies N.N.E. \\ E. 3 cables from the north extreme of Alden. Fldpoltaren, a patch with only one foot over it, lies 2 cables from the north-east side of Alden, with the south point of Tviberg bearing E.1S. Sunken rock. \u2014 A rock with 4 fathoms on it, lies W,|N,6 cables from the south point of Tviberg, and about the same distance from the north-east point of Alden. The west side of Tviberg is foul one cable off shore. Senholmtare carries 2 fathoms and lies W. A S. 3| cables from Senholmskjer, and S. f W. 9 cables from the south point of Tviberg. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The north extreme of Alden in line with the highest part of AtleS, or well open southward of Fladskjer bearing E. by S. \\ S., with lead between Remmane and Haastengrund, the south side of Fladsk jer may be approached within one cable. Vessels taking this passage should pass at least half a mile northward of V\u00e6rS ; and the same distance northward and eastward of Alden, taking care to avoid the dangers men tioned above. The north point of AtleS bearing E. by S. \u00a3 S. with lead between Haastenene and Rygstenene ; and the south extreme of Tviberg, bearing S.E. S., leads northward of Storefluer, which carry 2 to 4 fathoms, and"], [201, "CHAP, vii.] ALDEVAAG \u2014 HELGO. 183 lie 8^ cables south-eastward of Kvanskjer, the easternmost of the Haasten islets ; the latter bearing will also lead northward of Trolleflue and the 4 fathom rock between Alden and Tviberg. When entering Aldevaag, keep close to the point on the east side of the entrance, and bring up eastward of the rock on the west side of the harbour. The chart is the best guide for V\u00e6rS Sund. HELGO. \u2014 The harbour between HelgS, TansS, and the south-west side of Askroven or Askehongo, affords good shelter in 6 to 8 fathoms, and has a north and south entrance. At 2 cables from the north point of TansS the depth increases to 16 fathoms ; and in the narrow sound between Tanso and the south extreme of Askroven there are 4 fathoms, at the east end of this sound there is anchorage for small craft. Shoals extend one cable northward from the north point of HelgS, and the same distance S.S.E. from the point at Espes\u00e6t on the opposite side of the channel. The north-east side of HelgS is foul a short distance off shore ; and a shoal carrying 3 feet extends nearly one cable from the north west side of Tanso. The least intricate of the entrances to HelgS harbour from seaward are those between Jonsgrundfaldene and Knappen, or southward of Gunnarskjer but both these passages are dangerous to strangers. DANGERS. \u2014 A rock, on which the sea breaks, lies E. | S. one mile from Knappen ; and S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. half a mile from Knappen are two similar rocks lying close together. BLAASEBOEN, which is also indicated by breakers, lies E. S. 1^ miles from Gunnarskjer, and S. by E. i E. 9^ cables from Blegnen. BENDIKS SKJER is above water, and lies S.E. by E. 1 E. 2^- miles from Gunnarskjer, and South If miles from RSringerne. BendiksbO, a rocky patch on which the sea always breaks, lies E. by S. 4 cables from Bendiks skjer. Ldnnefaldet, lying W. f N. 7 cables from Bendiks skjer, carries 2 fathoms. MARKS. \u2014 Dorvalsnip, a hill almost exactly in the middle of Askroven, bearing E. | N., will lead southward of Gunnarskjer, Blaaseboen, and the rocks eastward of Knappen ; and northward of LSnnefaldet, and Bendiksbo. JAGTELIDFALDET is a small patch carrying 3 fathoms which lies half-way between Knappen and Guldholm, with the south points of that islet and TansS in line, and the outer part of Batalden in line with the west point of Reksten."], [202, "184 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vii. SMELDEN, a bank about three-quarters of a mile E.S.E. from Jagtelidfaldet, carries 3 to 6 fathoms, but there are several rocks on it which cover and uncover. The centre of the bank, which is one mile long East and West, and 4 cables broad North and South, bears W. by N. distant 1T8T miles from Guldholm. Sdrboer. \u2014 The southern extreme of SSrboer, on which there are 3 to 8 fathoms, lies W. by S. \\ S. 1-]% miles from the south point of Guld holm. Marks. \u2014 The west point of Batalden, in fine with the east point of Kinn, leads westward of Jagtelidfaldet ; Guldholm, just open southward of TansS, leads northward of Jagtelidfaldet and Smelden ; and Mensholm, kept northward of the northern hill on SvanS, leads southward of SSrboer. \u00c6sobo is awash, and lies N.E. half a mile from the north extreme of Guldholm. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When Haastenen, a peak on the mainland 3,280 feet high, bears about E. by S. \\ S., it will be a little southward of the centre of Askroven ; this mark will lead southward of Jonsgrund faldene, and between Jagtelidfaldet and the shoals southward of Kinn. When Guldholm is open south of TansS, steer direct for the entrance to HelgS harbour. Give the north sides of \u00c6sS and RauS a berth of 2 cables, and keep nearly in mid-channel between HelgS and Espes\u00e6t. The anchor may be dropped directly the vessel is past the rocks on the north side ot the harbour. Dorvalsnip bearing E. \\ N. will lead half a mile southward of Gun narskjer, and 3 cables southward of Blaaseboen. When between RSringerne and Bendiks skjer, steer for the northern hill on SvanS, edging to the southward when the west side of Batalden comes in line with the east point of Kinn, in order to clear SSrboer. Give the islets on the west side of the south entrance to the harbour a berth of 2 cables, and proceed as nearly as possible in mid-channel between HelgS and Tanso. To those not well acquainted with the marks, the chart will be the best guide. KINN SUND, between Kinn and Reksten, has good anchorage in the cove northward of the lighthouse, and also between the islets on the east side of the sound. On the west side of the south entrance, shoals extend nearly I1- cables off shore, and a rock with 3 fathoms on it lies S. by W. nearly 2 cables from the islet eastward of the lighthouse. The northern entrance is clear, with the exception of a shoal extending about half a cable from the north east side of Kinn, and a little foul ground off the north shore of the small islet on the east side of the entrance."], [203, "CHAP. VII.] 185 KINN SUND ; DIRECTIONS. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light is exhibited at an elevation of 25 feet from a small building on the hillock known as Rottevoldhoug, on the south-eastern part of Kinn. The light is visible for a distance of 8 miles between the bearings of N. by E. \\ E. through west to South, and is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 There are several passages leading to Kinn Sund from seaward. When the hill on the east end of Reksten bears East, it will be open southward of the eastern mountain on Kinn, and in line with the islet on the west side of the south entrance to the sound ; these marks will lead between Jonsgrund and Jonsgrundfaldene. A vessel will be eastward of the latter shoals when the highest part of Alden is in line with RSringerne, bearing South, or when YtterS (southward of Sverslingerne) bears N.E. \\ N. Care must be taken when proceeding to the eastward not to bring the hill on the east end of Reksten to bear southward of East, or northward of E. \\ N., as there are shoals on either side of the channel outside these lines of bearing. Give the islets off the south side of Kinn a berth of 2 cables, and when Kinn Sund is well open, or the lighthouse bears N. | W., proceed in mid-channel for the anchorage. A rock, with 4 fathoms on it, lies S.S.E. \\ E. 6 cables from the lighthouse point, therefore vessels must haul up for the entrance in time. The anchor may be let go at 2 cables N.E. by E. \\ E. from the lighthouse point. NORTHERN ENTRANCE. \u2014 To make Kinn Sund from the northward, bring the highest part of Batalden to bear between S.S.E. and S.E., distant 10 or 12 miles, and steer for it until the east side of Kinn or Kinn lighthouse bears South. The latter bearing will lead eastward ofthe dangers off Stevneskjer and Kvitingerne, and westward of those off Batalden and Skorpen. BrandsSflue is a 5-fathom patch which lies North 5^ miles from Kinn lighthouse, and S.E. by E. 1\u00a3 miles from Stevneskjer, therefore when the latter rock bears about W.N.W. vessels should take a broad sheer to the eastward or westward. When past N\u00e6rS, edge to the eastward until Kinn Sund is open, and proceed in mid-channel through the north entrance. The passage between the north-east point of Kinn and the small islet to the eastward is very narrow, but carries a depth of 20 fathoms close up to the shore on either side. Southward of Sendingerne.\u2014 If the vessel is southward of Sendingerne bring the south point of Batalden to bear E. by S. and steer for it until the eastern YtterS is in line with the highest part of Alden, bearing S. \\ W., when the vessel will be eastward of Garboerne. Then steer for the west side of Blaakoll (on Skorpen) until Kinn lighthouse bears South and proceed as already directed."], [204, "186 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [CHAP. VII. There is also a good passage between Tyskerfaldene and Haaboerne. The largest islet of the YtterS group, in line with the north point of Kinn or the latter point in line with the north-eastern steep edge of the hill on Reksten will lead in from seaward. Keep nearly in mid-channel between Sverslingerne and YtterS ; pass 2 or 3 cables northward of the rocks off N\u00e6rS, and the same distance southward of Kvitingerne ; and proceed for Kinn Sund as soon as the lighthouse bears South. BATALDEN. \u2014 There is good anchorage at the south end of the sound between the east side of Batalden and the long narrow islet SauS, which may be entered either from the northward or southward ; but as the roadstead is barely one cable wide, vessels using it should be steadied by shore hawsers. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Proceed according to the directions for the northern entrance to Kinn Sund, until Kinn lighthouse bears South. The north-west and west sides of Batalden should not be approached nearer than one mile, and the south-west side should be given a berth of half a mile. The north-west and north extremes of Lille Batalden may be passed at a distance of 5 or 6 cables. Give the north side of FanS a berth of at least one cable, and after passing southward of the rocks off the south eastern extreme of Batalden, proceed in mid-channel through the entrance to the sound. The anchor may be let go in 1 1 fathoms, as soon as the vessel passes the south point of SauS. NORTH ENTRANCE.\u2014 The northern entrance to Batalden harbour is very narrow. Shoals extend half a cable from the north points of SauS and the small islets to the northward ; a rock lies immediately northward of the projecting point on the east side of Batalden ; and a shoal extends a short distance northward from the rock off the west side of SauS. The hill on the northern part of Hovden (Bareksten) island, 1,000 feet high, bearing about E.S.E., will lead in between Djupsundkubber and the shoals off Aralden ; Blaakoll in line with SauS will lead eastward of Svartskjer and the rocks northward of Batalden. Give the north-east point of Batalden a berth of one cable, and proceed for the entrance to the sound, keeping on the west side of the channel until past the rock off SauS, when the anchor may be dropped at once. SMORHAVN is a small harbour formed by two of the southernmost islands off the south-western part of Bremanger. It is very narrow, but has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms. LIGHT. \u2014 Afixed red and white light, elevated 89 feet, and visible 9 miles, is shown from the south-west point of Fiskholm, a small islet bearing E. \\ N. distant 2A miles from Thorshovden. The light is red from S.E. | E. to S.E. by E. \\ E., and white from the latter bearing through east and north to W. by S. It is exhibited from the 1st of August to the 15th of May."], [205, "187 CHAP. VII.] BATALDEN \u2014 KALLEVAAG. Daymark. \u2014 The eastern entrance to SmSrhavn is marked by a wooden beacon, painted white, which stands on the north-east point of Rota. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing between Djupsundkubber and Aralden, with the hill on the northern part of Hovden (Bareksten) bearing E.S.E., proceed between GaasS and Bareksten, giving the former island a berth of 3 or 4 cables, and steer for Fiskholm. Fiskholm lighthouse must not be brought to bear southward of E. \u00a3 N. until the vessel is past the rocks off the south-east side of FrSjen ; and care must be taken to avoid a rock carrying 4 feet which lies S.E. \u00a7 E. 4| cables from Fiskholm. The west sides of Fiskholm and Rota are bold-to, but the western entrance to SmSr havn, though free from dangers, is extremely narrow. After passing a short cable westward of Fiskholm, steer N.E. along the west side of Rota, and proceed in mid-channel through the entrance to the harbour. At night. \u2014 Having passed between the shoals off Batalden and FrSjen at night, steer direct for Fiskholm light on an E.N.E. bearing, which will lead about 3 cables southward of the dangers off Djupsund kubber and GaasS, and proceed as directed above. Eastern entrance. \u2014 Shoals extend S.E. by E. one cable from the north-east point of Rota, and the same distance S. by W. from the south west point of Vareholm ; the outer extreme of the former, over which there are 3 feet, is marked by a staff and broom. When entering SmSr havn from the eastward, give this beacon a berth of half a cable, and pro ceed in mid-channel for the anchorage. The anchor may be let go in 6 fathoms, about one cable westward of the north-east point of Rota. KALLEVAAG is a small bay on the south-east side of FrSjen. Oh the west side of the bay is a rock marked by an iron pole. The best anchorage is about 11 cables eastward of this beacon, and the same distance from FrSjen, with Fiskholm lighthouse bearing S.E. by E. 1 E., distant lf^ miles. Small craft may pass southward of the beacon, and bring up westward of the islet on the south side of the bay in 4 fathoms. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Proceed according to the directions for SmSrhavn, until FrSjen church, on the east side of FrSjen, bears N. by E., when steer direct for it, and bring Fiskholm lighthouse between the bearings of S.E. \\ E. and S.E. by E. 1 E. ; these bearings will lead between the rocks on either side of the passage, to the anchorage eastward of the iron beacon. At night. \u2014 After passing Djupsundkubber and GaasS, with Fiskholm light bearing E.N.E., keep the light bearing northward of E. \\ N. until within one mile of it ; then haul to the northward, and directly the lio-ht shows red, starboard the helm and proceed for the anchorage, taking care to keep within the red sector."], [206, "188 HELLISO TO NORD FIORD. [chap. vn. BREMANGER POLL is an extensive bay on the west side of Bremanger. Hogsvig, one mile from the inner end of the bay on the north side, is a very small anchorage bordered by rocks and shoals, and can only be left with northerly or easterly winds. At one mile S.W. from Hogsvig is situated LSvikn\u00e6s point, and half a mile S.W. from this point there is a small anchorage between NSds\u00e6t and Myra. Off the entrance to Bremanger Poll there are several shoal patches, carrying from 7 to 9 fathoms, on which the sea occasionally breaks during westerly gales. Shoals and rocks extend from 3 cables to nearly three-quarters of a mile from the north and north west sides of FrSjen ; and the south side of the west point of Bremanger is bordered by rocks and shoals extending one mile offshore; therefore, when entering Bremanger Poll, vessels should pass about one mile northward ofthe north-west side of FrSjen, and keep nearly in mid-channel when proceeding to the eastward ; the chart is, however, the best guide. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage for small craft amongst the islets and rocks on either side of FrSjen, but the passages between them are so intricate and narrow that they can only be used by those thoroughly acquainted with the locality. INNER LEAD.\u2014 From the south entrance to Aide fiord (page 182) the Inner Lead continues between Tviberg and AtleS ; eastward of Hego and SkumsS, and westward of Staven\u00e6s ; past the east sides of Askroven and Oddene ; and between NekS and F\u00e6rS to Stabben, whence there are several passages leading northward to Froj SSen. There are also passages leading northward through Aide fiord and Kinn Sund, and westward of Batalden ; besides others too numerous to describe minutely. The best inner route for large vessels is through Viln\u00e6s fiord (page 177) and Grande Sund. LIGHTS. \u2014 The leading lights for the inner channels between Alden and Bremanger are Kinn, Stabben, and Fiskholm. Stabben lighthouse, which stands on a rock between Skorpo and BrandsS, is 33 feet high, and exhibits a fixed light, elevated 46 feet, and visible 9 miles. The light is white between the bearings of N.W. by W. 1 W. through north, east and south to W. by N. \\ N., and red in the direction of FlorS from the latter bearing to W. by N. \\ N. The light is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. BEACONS and DANGERS\u2014 On Havneholm, at the north side of the entrance to HindS harbour, is a black stone beacon with two white vertical stripes. A shoal, marked by a staff and broom beacon, extends half a cable east ward from Havneholm."], [207, "189 CHAP, vii.] INNER lead; DIRECTIONS. Hinddflue, marked by an iron pole, lies about 1\\ cables eastward of Havneholm, and 2 cables westward of the projecting point of AtleS on the north side of Djupevaag. RaCOOn rock,* carrying 15 feet, lies one cable south from the west point of the islet off the north-west extreme of AtleS ; and about one cable westward of AtleS north-west extreme is a rock carrying 9 feet ; the vicinity of these dangers is shown by a small rock above water, which lies halt-way between them. Leieskjer, a rock lying S.S.E. | E. 3 cables from the south-east point of Askroven, is marked by a stone beacon. Mortingbo lies S. W. 1^ cables from Stabben lighthouse, and is marked by an iron pillar. Stabbeflue, between Stabben and AanS, is marked by an iron pole with a cage on the top. Risholmflue, about 2 cables N.E. by E. from the north Risholm, and two-thirds of a mile eastward of Vevlungen, on the south side of Helle fiord, is also marked by an iron pole ; a shoal extends about one cable northward and south-eastward from Risholmflue. Drageskjergrund, a shoal carryings feet, which lies about 4 cables eastward of the north point of North N\u00e6rS, is marked by a staff and broom. Holl\u00e6nderne are several rocky heads on a reef extending about half a mile northward from GaasS (east of Bareksten) ; the northernmost rock is marked by a staff and broom. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If intending to pass through Grande Sund from Viln\u00e6s fiord, give the east side of FlatS a berth of 2 cables, and proceed in mid-channel through the sound. After passing Staven\u00e6s within a distance of 2 cables, in order to avoid the rocks lying southward of the small islet FanS, steer for the east point of Askroven, bearing N.N.E. \u00a3 E., until past the HSi holms ; and pass between Askroven and Leieskjer. Give the east side of Oddene islets a fair berth, and proceed between F\u00e6rS and NekS ; westward of Mortingbo ; and between Stabben and Stabbeflue, to Helle fiord ; from thence the best passage to FrSie SSen is eastward of the N\u00e6rS group and the islets to the northward. The rocks above water lying close to the mainland northward of Dra geskjer may be approached within 2 cables, but a shoal extends a long cable eastward from Langvingen, a very low islet on the south side of the entrance to FrSie SSen.

ANCHORAGE.\u2014 There is anchorage in Grande Sund on the east side of PrestS, and northward of the islets on the east side of Saue Sund ; the latter is the most commodious harbour. StavenSBS-havn, between the two northernmost islets off Staven\u00e6s, has anchorage for small craft in 5 fathoms. Oddene. \u2014 The next anchorage northward of HelgS harbour is on the south-east side of the Oddene group, where small vessels might bring up for a time in 5 fathoms. Nekd. \u2014 There is a small harbour between North and South NekS ; the eastern entrance is very narrow, and only carries 4 fathoms water. Vessels must keep close in to the north side of South NekS when entering from the eastward. FLORO. \u2014 On the north side of BrandsS is the small trading town of FlorS, which has a population of about 500. A shoal, extending 1^ cables E. by N. and W. by S., on the north side of the entrance to FlorS, is marked by two staff and broom beacons ; and a shoal, extending a short distance eastward from the islet on the west side of the harbour, is marked by an iron pole. Stabben lighthouse, kept astern and bearing between W. by N. A N. and W. by N. N., or the red sector of Stabben light, will lead clear up to FlorS ; but when entering the harbour at night, care must be taken to avoid the islet off the west end of the town. Furnsund, a narrow channel between the islets westward of BrandsS, is only used by small coasters bound to or from FlorS. There is anchorage for small craft on either side of the island at the south end of the sound ; two shoals on the west side of the island are marked by staff and broom beacons. On Langoxen, a small islet on the east side of the north entrance to Furnsund, is a stone beacon, painted yellow. BETWEEN TVIBERG and ATLEO.\u2014 When entering the channel between Tviberg and AtleS, give the east side of the Senholms a berth of 3 or 4 cables, and pass about 2 cables westward of Blegeskjer. The east side of Tviberg, and the west side of AtleS, may be approached to within half a cable. Keep in mid-channel between the beacons on the shoals eastward of Havneholm ; give the western extreme of the islet off the north-west point of AtleS a berth of 1^ cables ; and proceed southward of Hego, and eastward of SkumsS and Melsholm, to Staven\u00e6s."], [209, "CHAP, vii.] FLORO \u2014 FROJ SOEN. 191 There is also a channel between HegS and the islets to the westward, which continues westward of the northernmost islet off VardS, and eastward of the rocks off Sandholm. The passage southward and eastward of the islets and rocks off the north-west point of AtleS is very narrow. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage for small vessels between the north-east point of HindS and Havne holm,* in 8 fathoms, and also in the sound between HegS and SkumsS. THROUGH KINN SUND. \u2014From Aide fiord, there is a passage leading eastward of Molv\u00e6r, westward of Jagtelidfaldet, and through Kinn Sund, to the entrance of FrSj SSen. Having passed west ward of Senholmtare and Tviberg, and between Molv\u00e6r and Kvanskjer, steer for the eastern mountain on Kinn, until the western extreme of that island bears North, when steer for it on that bearing, which will lead nearly in mid-channel between Stor and Lille Lejesten, two small rocks about 1 smiles southward of Kinn; and when the hill on the east end of Reksten bears E. N., proceed according to the directions for Kinn Sund (page 185). When proceeding to the northward with Kinn lighthouse bearing South, vessels should haul to the eastward or westward to avoid BrandsSflue as soon as Stevneskjer bears N.W. Reksten and Skorpe Fiords connect Kinn Sund with the Inner Lead. The south sides of Reksten and Skorpen may be approached to within one cable ; but the islets and rocks on the south sides of both channels should be given a good berth, as there are numerous shoal patches between them. The most direct passage from Skorpe Fiord to Stabben is between AanS and the Grindholms. When taking the channel between the latter islets and NekS, vessels must pass southwards of Tr\u00e6ttebo, which lies S.E. 2 cables from Tr\u00e6tteskjer, and is marked by an iron pole. There is indifferent anchorage in Rognaldsvaagen, on the south-west side of Reksten ; and also in the small cove eastward of the islet on the south side of the west point of Skorpen. FROJ SOEN is a broad clear channel between the south side of Bremanger and the mainland. The depth varies from 100 to over 200 fathoms, and eastward of SmSrhavn the land on either side may be approached to within one cable. Anchorage. \u2014 In FrSj SSen there is anchorage within Rydlands holm, about 3 miles eastward of SmSrhavn, in 7 fathoms ; in the eastern part of the sound between H\u00e6nSen and the mainland, 6 miles eastward of Rydlandsholm, in 5 to 14 fathoms ; and in a small cove on the north-east side of MarS, eastward of Bremanger, in 12 fathoms. * H.M.S.

SKATE STROM * is a rapid tidal stream which runs through the narrow passage between the foot of Hornelen and Rugsudo. This passage leads from FrSj SSen to Nord fiord, Vaags fiord, and Faa fiord. Hornelflue lies on the north side of the eastern entrance to Skate Strom, and carries 3 feet ; Midtflue carries 2 feet, and lies 3^ cables north-west ward of Hornelflue ; and Skaten, which lies one cable from Bremanger opposite Klubben, has only one foot over it ; these rocks are marked by iron poles. Shoals extend nearly one cable from Bremanger at Klubben and Honskaar, two small farms about a mile eastward of the west point of RugsundS . When passing through the Skate StrSm, vessels must pass southward of Hornelflue and Midtflue, and northward of Skaten, proceeding either eastward or westward of RisS to Vaags fiord or Nord fiord. Anchorage. \u2014 Small craft may anchor between the south side of RugsundS and the islets at Nygaar and Havnen, northward of Honskaar. Between the west point of RugsundS and RisS there is a roadstead with a depth of 6 to 11 fathoms. RugSUnd, between the east side of RugsundS and the mainland, is a narrow passage which can only be used by very small vessels. INNER FIORDS. The inner fiords between Aa fiord and Nord fiord belong to the SSndfiord district ; the scenery on most of them is very fine, and good sport may be obtained in their immediate vicinity. Dais Fiord extends about 17 miles eastward from Viln\u00e6s fiord through very beautiful scenery ; but is principally interesting on account of its historical associations. Towards the inner end of the fiord, on the north side, is LSkelandsfos, a double fall 300 feet high. Vaardalsflue, a rock lying 6 cables north-eastward of Kysn\u00e6s, the point on the south side of the entrance to Dais fiord, carries one foot, aud is marked by an iron pole. Anchorage may be found at various places in Dais Fiord and its branches. Stang Fiord extends 5 miles inland on the south side of Staven\u00e6s, and has good anchorage at the inner end in 8 to 13 fathoms. * It was formerly a common practice to fire guns when passing through the Skate Strom, for the sake of hearing the echoes ; but this has been discontinued, owing to the risk of detaching masses of rock from the precipitous face of Hornelen by the con cussion. Hornelen is the most stupendious sea-cliff in Europe. Its height is nearly 3,000 feet, exceeding that of Skiddaw, above Derwentwater, and the whole of this is bare rock, where not perpendicular overhanging. Lieut. G. T.

COAST.* \u2014 About 12 miles north-eastward of Bremanger is the peninsula of Stadt or Stadtlandet, one of the most remarkable promontories on the coast of Norway ; it projects about 14 miles in a N.N.W. direction from the mainland, and the large openings on either side are very conspicuous from the offing. In hazy weather, when only small por tions ofthe coast can be seen, it must be remembered that above the points Staven and Staalet are small peaks resembling detached rocks. Revihorn hill, on the east side of Stadt, also appears from some positions to be detached ; it is circular at the base, and has a conical summit. From a position 10 or 12 miles westward of Stadt, the opening on the south side of the promontory is very conspicuous. VaagsS will appear about the same height as Bremanger ; HusevaagS is much lower, and has several small peaks on it ; the small opening of Faa fiord will be clearly visible ; and FrSjen will be seen a little westward of Bremanger. Veststejn and KlSvning two small islets off the north-west part of Bremanger, stand out distinctly from the land behind them, and may be seen from a distance of 10 or 12 miles ; Veststejn rises gradually to a single small peak, but KlSvning is divided into two nearly equal parts by a deep cleft, and is an excellent mark for the rocks off the entrances to Faa fiord and Vaags fiord. If the vessel is farther northward, Hornelen mountain (page 192) on the east end of Bremanger will be very conspicuous, although there are other lofty moun tains in its vicinity, it is 2,950 feet high,. with two jagged summits, and falls nearly perpendicularly to the eastward. Skolmen mountain, 6 miles northward of Hornelen, is not so lofty ; it rises gradually on three sides, terminates in a single peak, and falls abruptly to the eastward. Pilots are stationed in the bay on the west side of VaagsS ; on Kraaken\u00e6s, the north-western extreme of the same island ; in Sildegabet ; and on the west side of Stadt, but they cannot come out to a vessel in the offing in bad weather if the wind is on shore. * See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Norway, west coast, sheet III., Stav fiord to Romsdals islands, No. 2,305."], [213, "CHAP.

DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The south-west side of Silden in line with Skongsn\u00e6s will lead into Sildegabet between Melsfiuer and Kraaka. Give Skongsn\u00e6s a berth of 3 or 4 cables, and steer for Ulvesund lighthouse on a S. I W. bearing ; pass westward of HalsSrflue, taking care at the same time not to approach the east side of VaagsS nearer than 2 cables ; and when Ulvesund is well open, proceed through it, giving the land on either side a berth of one cable. The anchor may be let go in Skarebugten, on the west side of the sound, when Ulvesund lighthouse bears about E. by S. S. ; anchorage will also be found about a mile south-westward of VaagsS church. There is also a good entrance to Sildegabet between Kraaka and Utryg gen ; the highest part of SeljeS bearing S.E. by E.

At night. \u2014 When standing in for Sildegabet at night, a good offing must be kept until the vessel is within the limits of the arc over which Skongsn\u00e6s light flashes, which will lead in between Melsfiuer and Kraaka. When within half a mile of Skongsn\u00e6s light, haul to the eastward to clear the shoals off Skongsn\u00e6s ; then steer for Ulvesund light, keeping as near as possible to the western limit of the light, in order to avoid HalsSrflue, and proceed as already directed. After losing sight of Skongsn\u00e6s light between VaagsS and Silden, strangers must proceed with caution, as the western limit of Ulvesund light leads very close to the shoals off Halsor. Silden. \u2014 There are two anchorages on the east side of Silden, but they are only suitable for small craft. The north-east point of Silden must be given a berth of 2 to 3 cables ; the south-west and south sides of the island may be passed at a distances of 2 cables.

Ulvesund : \u2014 Gieleskjer and Trolleboflue are marked by iron pillars ; Ulven by an iron pillar with staff and ball. SmSrskjer, a rock lying N.E. by E. \\ E. 9 cables from Ulvesund light house, is marked by an iron pillar. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing either eastward or westward of RisS, proceed between HusevaagS and the mainland for the entrance to MoldSsund. A rock, carrying 4*r fathoms, lies S. by W. 1 W. 3 cables from Blaalin\u00e6s, otherwise the channel is clear. The passage between the shoals on either side of MoldSsund is about 30 yards wide ; when passing through, vessels must keep about 30 yards from the western shore of the sound. TrollebSflue, Lestholm, and Ulven may be passed on either side at a dis tance of not less than half a cable ; northward of Ulveu the land on either side must not be approached nearer than one cable. After passing Ulve sund lighthouse, vessels may either proceed as already directed past Skongsn\u00e6s, and eastward or westward of the shoals off Kraaka, or they may pass southward of SmSrskjer, and eastward of Silden, to the passage between Kraaka and Dragefaldet ; the islets westward of SeljeS bearing N.E. i E. will lead eastward of the 8-fathom patches north-eastward of Silden. When rounding Stadt, the coasting steam vessels frequently pass * Norwegian Notice to Mariners, No. 11 of 1879."], [219, "201 CHAP. VIII.] INNER LEAD \u2014 SVINOEN. eastward of Utryggen, Ysteboen, and Bukketyvene, and westward of Skjerbo, in order to shorten the distance, but strangers should give all these dangers a wide berth. The summit of Hornelen, just visible east ward of Skolmen, leads eastward of Utryggen and Ysteboen. Anchorage. \u2014 Small vessels might bring up in 6 fathoms between SkavS and the mainland, half a mile eastward of Blaalin\u00e6s. In Ulvesund there is anchorage northward of MoldS in 10 to 11 fathoms, over rocky ground ; close inshore on the west side of the sound, 4 cables northward of Lestholm, in 8 fathoms ; about a mile south-westward of VaagsS church in 12 fathoms; and in Skarebugt, westward of Ulvesund lighthouse in 16 fathoms. NORD FIORD extends about 45 miles inland from the east end of Vaags fiord ; the inner part, which is known as Indvik fiord, rivals the Har danger and Sogne fiords in beauty and grandeur. The district of Nord fiord affords excellent sport, and the Nord fiord horses are considered the best bred in Norway. Almingdingfluerne, two rocks lying 4^ cables from the mainland north ward of RugsundS, are marked by iron poles ; east ward of these rocks, the main channel, which is from 200 to 300 fathoms deep, is free from dangers. Anchorage may be found close to the shore in many places, but generally speaking there is deep water within a short distance of the land. COAST. STADT to BRED SUND.\u2014 From Stadt to Trondhjem, the outer coast line trends about E.N.E., but it is more than any other part of the coast intersected by ramifications of inlets, and broken into numerous straggling peninsulas, promontories, and islands. The islands between Stadt and Bred Sund, a distance of 25 miles, are very lofty and steep towards the sea ; the land behind them is also very high. The open ing of Bred Sund, between HarejdS and GodS, is very conspicuous from the offing ; SvinSen and Rundo lighthouse are excellent landmarks ; and Sukkertoppen on HesS, a sugarloaf hill, 1,050 feet high, which appears from the westward like a detached cone, is a good guide for the dangers northward of RundS ; the latter island is high, with the exception of Kvuln\u00e6s. SVINOEN is a small but conspicuous islet lying 5^ miles from the nearest land, with the north-west point of Stadt bearing S.W. A W. distant 91 miles, and the highest part of Skorpen bearing E. by S. *\u25a0 S. ; it is dis tinguished by a stone beacon with a flat top, and there is no similar islet in the vicinity. Kalven is a small rock about 2 cables northward of SvinSen."], [220, "202 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS. [CHAP. VIII. LIGHT. \u2014 A circular iron tower 126 feet high, painted red with a white belt 24 feet broad, stands on Kvaln\u00e6s, the north-west point of RundS ; it exhibits, from the 1st of August to the 15th of May, a fixed white light, elevated 158 feet, and visible for a distance of 20 miles sea ward in clear weather. PILOTS are stationed on SandS, Skorpen, and RundS. Tides and Currents. \u2014 Northward of Stadtlandet, the main stream of flood sets north-eastward, and the ebb south-westward; but between the islands, the streams vary in direction and velocity. During strong westerly and southerly winds, both streams set north-eastward, and with continuous easterly winds, south-westward; the north-east going stream is always the strongest. It is high water, full and change, at RundS, at lOh. 34m. ; springs rise from 5 to 6 feet. At a distance of 30 to 60 miles from the land the current perceptibly carries a vessel to the north-eastward, a fact which must be borne in mind when bound for any particular inlet. DANGERS. \u2014 The outer dangers between Stadtlandet and the en trance to Bred Sund are Jukleboen, Jeitmaren, Heste reefs, Golla, Vallebo, and Haaflue ; the shoals between Stadt and Jukleboen are all within 2\\ miles of the outer islands. Jukleboen, which lies W. by N. \\ N. 2\\ miles from Mulen\u00e6s, the north-western extreme of NerlandsS, is the outer rock on a range of shoals extending about W.N.W. nearly 3 miles from the west side of that island ; it carries 4 fathoms, and in bad weather is generally indicated by breakers. A vessel will be northward of Jukleboen when Roppehorn or Roph\u00e6tta, a mountaiu on the north-west part of HarejdS, is open northward of Goldn\u00e6s, the north point of NerlandsS, bearing about E. by S. \\ S. SvinSen beacon, in line with the north-western extreme of Stadt, leads westward of all the shoals between Stadt and RundS. Jeitmaren lies W. by S. \\ S. nearly 2 miles from RundS lighthouse ; it carries 15 feet, and breaks occasionally, but not violently, in fine weather, and very seldom during calms, or with off-shore winds. The highest part of GodS, open northward of Kvaln\u00e6s, or RundS lighthouse bearing East, will lead northward of Jeitmaren. Heste reefs extend nearly one mile north-westward and north ward, and 1^ miles north-eastward from RundS lighthouse; Baren and Vaaren are the principal rocks upon these reefs, and they are always visible. The northernmost of Vaaren rocks may be passed at a distance of 2 cables."], [221, "203 CHAP. VIII.] DANGERS OFF STADT. Golla. \u2014 The southernmost of the three rocks known as Golla, which carry from 4J* to 6 fathoms, lies N.E. \u00a3 N. 1^ miles from Vaaren rocks. The north point of Gr\u00e6sholmen, an islet 3 miles eastward of RundS, bearing S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. leads between Vaaren and Golla. Valleboen is a bank on which there are seven rocks carrying from 9 feet to 6 fathoms ; it is about a mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E., and half a mile broad ; the south-western extreme, on which there are 2 fathoms, lies N.N.W. 1 W. 3i miles from Gr\u00e6sholmen, with RundS lighthouse bearing S.W. i W. In bad weather, the position of Valleboen is generally indi cated by breakers. Haaflue, which carries 5 fathoms, lies N. W. 2\\ miles from the east point of Gr\u00e6sholmen. Marks. \u2014 The west side of Gr\u00e6sholmen bearing S.E. \\ S. will lead between Golla and Valleboen ; Sukkertoppen on HesS, open fully its own width southward of GodS, leads southward of Valleboen and Haaflue ; and the south-western extreme of GodS bearing S.E. by E. leads between Valleboen and the shoals westward of VikerS. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing about half a mile eastward or west ward of SvinSen and Kalven, keep SvinSen beacon bearing S.W. until Roph\u00e6tta is well open northward of Goldn\u00e6s, or until the latter point bears E.S.E. ; then steer E.N.E. until the marks for clearing Golla and Valleboen are distinguished, when course may be altered for Bred Sund. If bound to the northward outside the islands, keep RundS lighthouse bearing eastward of S.S.W. until the highest part of LepsS bears E.S.E., when course may be altered to pass about 10 miles westward of Romsdals islands. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 After passing northward of Heste reefs, vessels may proceed either eastward or westward of the Treholms, the dangers off which are almost always indicated by breakers, and bring up about half a mile from the south-east side of RundS in 8 fathoms over sand ; this roadstead is exposed to a westerly swell, but may be left with any wind. The south-east side of RundS is foul nearly 4 cables off shore. Rundd Sund, a very narrow passage between RemS and the rocks off the south side of RundS, should not be used by large vessels. Bolla, a round smooth rock nearly one cable from the north point of RemS, is above water ; a 2^-fathom patch lies one cable south-westward of Bolla and three-quarters of a cable westward of the north point of RemS, and sunken rocks extend 3 cables from the south-west point of RundS. Roph\u00e6tta open northward of NerlandsS, or Goldn\u00e6s bearing E.S.E., will lead between Jukleboen and Jeitmaren, and after passing about half a * Annonce Hy'drographique, Paris, No. 133 of 1879."], [222, "204 NORD FJORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS. [chap. vin. mile northward of Goldn\u00e6s, and 4 or 5 cables southward of the south-west point of RundS, vessels may steer direct for Bolla ; it is better to pass northward of the 21-fathom patch off the north point of Remo, as Bolla rock is steep, aud the channel is straighter and broader than that to the southward. When well past Bolla, vessels may either anchor between RundS and RemS, or proceed southward of Gr\u00e6sholmen to Bred Sund. Holme Fiord. \u2014 After passing Goldn\u00e6s, vessels might proceed west ward of RemS, giving the rocks off the north-east point of NerlandsS a berth of nearly 2 cables, to Holme fiord, where there is good anchorage southward of Teigen\u00e6s in 7 to 10 fathoms over sand and clay. The east and south extremes of the shoal off Teigen\u00e6s, and the outer part of the shoal on the south side of the anchorage, are marked by pole beacons. As the only practicable entrance to Holme fiord is eastward of the shoal off Teigen\u00e6s, the anchorage is only suitable for northward bound vessels. VANELV GABET, between the north-east side of Stadtlandet and KvamsS, is a good open passage leading to Vanelvs fiord and Haugs fiord. Vanelvs fiord extends about 10 miles to the southward from Vanelv Gabet ; it is visited by the coasting steam vessels, but is of little importance to strangers. TIauo-s fiord has several commodious anchorages, whence vessels may either put to sea with ease, or continue through Aareimsund to the Inner Lead. DANGERS. \u2014 The whole of the north-east side of Stadtlandet is foul to a distance of 2 to 3 cables off shore ; shoals and sunken rocks extend about one mile westward and south-westward from RistS ; and the south west side of KvamsS should not be approached nearer than one mile. Ristoflue, an 8-fathom patch, between 7 and 8 cables south-westward of the west end of KvamsS ; Svartskjer, a rock above water lying half a mile north-westward of the lighthouse on FrekS; and a shoal spit extending 2 cables from the west point of FrekS, are the outermost dangers on the east side of Vanelv Gabet. Marks. \u2014 Fluevaagn\u00e6s, the point on the east side of the entrance to Vanelvs fiord, open eastward of Revihorn will lead between the shoals off Stadtlandet and KvamsS. LIGHT. \u2014 On the western point of FrekS stands a white concrete light house, which exhibits, at an elevation of 65 feet, a fixed white light, visible 10 miles when bearing from S. by E. f E. through east, north, and west to W. by S. % S., except between the bearings of S.E. S. and S.E. by E., also from W. \u00a7 N. to W. f S., where it shows red. The bearing S. by E. f E. leads west of the sunken rocks outside KvamsS (with the exception of RistSflue) and east of Svartskjer. The bearing S.E. S. leads northward of tho dangers off Stadt. The bearing W. \u00a7 N. leads northward of"], [223, "CHAP. VIII.] 205 VANELV GABET \u2014 INNER LEAD. Terneskjerbo ; and the bearing W \u00a3 S. leads northward of Bleka and NystSlflue. In the direction of NystSl the light is partially obscured by the high part of FrekS, east of the lighthouse. The light is exhibited from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The anchorages on the west side of Haugs fiord are capable of accommodating about 12 large vessels. Store Sund, between Haugsholm and the islets off KvamsS, has good anchorage in 9 to 16 fathoms over sand ; the best position is between the north points of FrekS and Haugsholm ; farther to the northward the bottom is stoney. FrekS flue, a rock off the lighthouse, is marked by a stone beacon, and Ternesk jerbo which lies N.E. by N. 2 cables from the north point of Haugsholm, by a staff and broom. Small vessels may anchor off the north side of FrekS in 5-| to 8 fathoms, or between the east side of Storholm and GrSnneskjerboerne in 4 fathoms, but the anchorage is only one cable broad. Off the east side of Haugsholm there is anchorage for large vessels in 12 to 15 fathoms, and off the south-east side of KvamsS in 6 to 14 fathoms, but the banks are rather steep to the eastward. A rock, north of the small cove on the east side of Haugsholm, is marked by a staff and broom. Aareimsund is a narrow channel between the islands southward of SandS and the mainland. NystSlflue, a rock lying nearly 3 cables from the mainland, northward of NystSl, is marked by an iron pole ; and there is a stone beacon on Bleka, which lies 2 cables from the north point of the mainland between Haugs fiord and Rovde fiord. A 3^-fathom patch nearly one cable in diameter lies 3 cables from the south point of VoksS and 4 cables N.W. by W. from Bleka. Stabbene rock, 3^ cables E. \\ S. from Bleka, is marked by an iron pole ; a shoal extends fully one cable N.W. by W. from Stabbene. After passing westward of NystSlflue and Bleka, vessels may either proceed southward of Stabbene to the Inner Lead, or they may bring up in the harbour eastward of VoksS, where there is room for one large vessel in 5 to 7 fathoms, shoaling to 4 fathoms on the west side of the anchorage over sand ; on the east side of the entrance, about 1 i cables from VoksS, there are only 3^ fathoms. INNER LEAD. \u2014 From Aareimsund vessels may proceed either westward and northward or southward and eastward of the large islands GurskeS and Hareidland (HarejdS) to Bred Sund ; the former is the most direct route, but the channels northward of GurskeS are very intricate ; the passage through the RSvde, Vartdals, and Sulen fiords is much easier, and barely 5 miles longer. ,"], [224, "206 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS. [CHAP. VIII. Rdvde and VartdalS Fiords, which separate GurskeS and Harejdo from the mainland, are deep clear channels from one to 1^ miles broad. A shoal spit runs one cable off the point on the east side of the entrance to SSvde fiord; a rock lies N.E. by N. 1J cables from the small holm northward of RSvde church ; and there is a 3^-fathom patch 2\\ cables northward of the point on the east side of the entrance to Volden fiord. With these exceptions, the land may everywhere be approached to within one cable. There is anchorage in 9 fathoms in a small bay 2 miles E. by S. from Aareimsund ; the entrance is between Kjipeholm and the rock to the northward. During calms, vessels might bring up close to the shore at several places ; there [is temporary anchorage on the west side of OksS ; northward of RodS ; and between HarejdS and the north point of EkS. Sulen Fiord, which connects Vartdals fiord with Bred Sund, is also free from dangers, but the point north-westward of HjSringn\u00e6s must be given a berth of 2 cables, and vessels must not stand too far into the bay opposite Harejde church ; a shoal extends 2 cables from the point on the east side of the north entrance to Sulen fiord. Liavaag, three-quarters of a mile westward of HjSringn\u00e6s, has anchorage in 10 to 15 fathoms. Sands Fiord, the direct continuation of the Inner Lead from Aareim sund, is a clear open channel between SandS and GurskeS. There is anchorage for one to two vessels of moderate size in outer Sandshavn, on the east side of SandS, in 5 to 10 fathoms over sand ; the inner harbour has a depth of 3^ fathoms, but only very small vessels can warp in. The anchorages are bordered by shoals, which are marked by dolphins and iron poles. Kleveboen, a sunken rock nearly 2\\ cables from the north-eastern part of SandS, is marked by a staff and broom. Vessels should give the east side of SandS northward of Sandshavn a berth of at least 3 cables. From Sands fiord vessels may proceed southward of Hidsboen, Langfiua, and Flaav\u00e6r, and northward of Kvaleboen, to HerS fiord. The rocks above water off the mainland, southward of Flaav\u00e6r, must be given a berth of 2 cables; Kvaleboen, which carries 4 feet, lies 1| cables from the south eastern rocks of Flaav\u00e6r ; and Tronden, a rock above water half a mile eastward of Flaav\u00e6r, maybe passed on either side at a distance of 1^ cables. If wishing to enter Sands fiord from seaward, proceed according to the following directions for Flaav\u00e6r until the west side of SandS bears S. by W. ; give the north side of SandS a berth of at least half a mile, and haul to the southward when Sands fiord is well open. FLAAV\u00c6R. \u2014 Vessels may stand in from seaward between SandS and Skorpen, and pass either northward or southward of Flaav\u00e6r,\" (a cluster of islets and rocks between GurskeS and NerlandsS), to Hero fiord. Flaav\u00e6r"], [225, "207 CHAP. VIU.] ROVDE FIORD \u2014 FLAAV\u00c6R. havn has good anchorage for small vessels in 6 to 8 fathoms over sand, but vessels drawing more than 12 feet must enter from the eastward. Large vessels might pass through the channels northward and eastward of Flaav\u00e6r, but they would find no anchorage. The following are the princi pal dangers to be avoided when approaching Flaav\u00e6r from seaward : \u2014 SKJ\u00c6GGENE, a dangerous ledge on which the sea breaks in bad weather, is the outermost of the shoals north-westward of RistS and SandS ; the north-eastern rock lies about N. f E. If miles from the west end of RistS, with the north side of SandS bearing E. by S. southerly. Marks. \u2014 The north-west point|of RundS, visible westward of Mulen\u00e6s, leads westward of Skj\u00e6ggene, and Flaav\u00e6r lighthouse bearing E. \\ N. leads northwards. Remmeflua, Fausken, and Aarbenden, three patches be- tween SvinSen and Skorpen, carry 10, 4, and 6 fathoms respectively. NystSlshorn, a lofty and pointed mountain on the mainland southward of SandS, in line with the west point of that island, bearing about S. by E., leads westward of the shoals, and Melshorn on HarejdS, open southward of Skorpen, leads southward. The western rock of Flesene, in fine with the north-east point of SapdS, and Hallenuppen hill, bearing S.S.E., will lead eastward of Remmeflua and westward of Fausken and Aarbenden. Nabben aud Store Goddflue. \u2014 Nabben is a 5-fathom patch lying W. by S. J S. 1| miles from the south extreme of Skorpen ; Store GodSflue, which carries 3 to 5 fathoms, lies S.W. S. 8 cables from the same point. Lille Goddflue, which lies S. by E. i E. 1^ miles from the south jioint of Skorpen, carries 6 feet, and is marked by a staff and broom. Penningflue, which lies half-way between Store fErkn\u00e6skjer and Flaav\u00e6r lighthouse, is marked by an iron pole. Store Erkn\u00e6skjer is above water, but shoals extend from it about 2 cables to the southward and westward. North Stabben, a rock carrying 10 feet, lies E.N.E. half a mile from Store Erkn\u00e6skjer, and the same distance north-westward of Penningflue. Eastern ' entrance. \u2014 The Store and Lille Kuholms, on the east side of Flaav\u00e6r, are marked by white stone beacons, and there are iron poles on the east and north-west extremes of Kuflue, a shoal extending north-eastward and westward from the Kuholms. A shoal in the eastern entrance to Flaav\u00e6r havn is marked by two iron poles; and Rugflue, on the north side of the passage, by one iron pole. LIGHT. \u2014 From the 1st of August to the 15th of May a fixed white light elevated 49 feet, and visible 11 miles, is shown from the west point of Varholm, the western islet of Flaav\u00e6r. In the direction of Skj\u00e6ggene, or between the bearings E. | N. and East, the light changes from white to red every three seconds."], [226, "208 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS. [chap. vni. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When standing in for Flaav\u00e6r by daylight, vessels should pass at least 2 miles northward of RistS, one mile north ward of SandS, and half a mile northward of Flesene. Flaav\u00e6r lighthouse bearing East will lead northward of Lille GodSflue, and southward of Store GodSflue, Erkn\u00e6skjer, and Penningflue ; when clear of the latter shoal, course may be altered to pass westward and northward of all the Flaav\u00e6r islets to HerS fiord ; the passage southward of Flaav\u00e6r is narrower and more intricate. Entering Flaav\u00e6r havn from the westward, pass a good half cable northward of the lighthouse, and proceed in mid channel between Varholm and the islet to the northward. The best entrance from the eastward is northward of all the beacons except that on Rugflue, but there is also a passage between Kuflue and the shoal to the westward. At night. \u2014 When standing in for Flaav\u00e6r at night, it must be borne in mind that the difference between the changeable and fixed light is sometimes not easily distinguished, therefore, as it is necessary to keep near the northern boundary between the two, which will lead clear in from seaward, the light should always be kept bearing East. RORESUND and ULFSTEN FIORD\u2014 From Flaav\u00e6r and HerS fiord, the Inner Lead continues through RSresund to Ulsten fiord, whence vessels may proceed eastward of VatSen, \u00c6gholmen, and Florauden, to Bred Sund. Torvikleden, which leads between BSland and the islands to the eastward, is the best passage through Ulfsten fiord ; the channels leading eastward of HatleS are extremely narrow and intricate. There is a boat passage between BergsS aud BSland. Beacons. \u2014 Between Flaav\u00e6r and Bred Sund are the following beacons: \u2014 Myklebustfiue, on the west side of the entrance to the passage be'tween BergsS and BSland, marked by an iron pole. Vaulen, along the dredged channel, marked by three stone beacons. Kirkeflue and RSrastSflue, HerS, marked by iron poles. Brandholm and Storeholm, Torvikleden, marked by white stone beacons. Skarvikflue, south of Torvikholm, Torvikflue, Taska, Boen, and Skind broka, marked by iron poles. Paulflue, Kalvosund, marked by staff and broom. Stenen, Guldsmedholm, on which is an iron pole. HatleSflue, J\u00e6gtesten, and RSisa, eastward of HatleS, marked by iron poles. Kuflue, south of VatSen, on which is an iron pole. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When proceeding eastward from Hero fiord, pass about 2\\ cables southward of Myklebustfiue, and proceed in mid-channel through RSresund ; give the rocks off the south-east side of BSland a fair berth, continue in mid-channel between the Torvikholms and the rocks off"], [227, "CHAP. VIII.] 209 FLAAV\u00c6R \u2014 BRED SUND. the point to the south-westward, and proceed westward of the Byholms, and eastward of Kuflue and VatSen. After passing about H cables eastward of the islands northward of VatSen, bring ErknS lighthouse in line with the east point of Florauden ; this mark will lead westward of the shoal patches lying between 6 and 7 cables from the foot of Roph\u00e6tta, and eastward of the sunken rocks extending 4 cables from \u00c6gholmen ; when about half-way between \u00c6gholmen and Florauden, course may be altered to pass 2 or 3 cables southward of the latter islet to Bred Sund. The KalvS Sund passage leads eastward of Paulflue, northward of KalvS, and eastward of Store HatleS and the Byholms, but as already observed, it is narrow and intricate. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage for small vessels in FrSstadvaag, a creek on the south side of BSland, and also in the cove north of Hero church. On the south side of Store HatleS there is a small harbour with a depth of 7 to 8 fathoms, and anchorage may also be found in the bay northward of Sanden\u00e6s, 2 miles eastward of KalvS. From the south point of VatSen, large vessels might pass half a mile eastward and northward of KjSrfleskene, and the same distance south-westward of Midtfiordskjer, to the anchorage south of RundS. BRED SUND is the largest and most accessible inlet between Stadtlandet and the Halten islands, therefore vessels bound to Molde, Kris tiansund, or Trondhjem, frequently put in here in order to obtain a pilot, and proceed either inside or outside Romsdals islands according to their draught. HogSten reefextends nearly 2 cables from the south-eastern extreme of GodS, and shows clearly under water. Dybeflue, which carries 7 fathoms, lies S.E. by S. 3 cables from Hogsten lighthouse. Skarveflue, a 3-fathom patch about 6 cables from the west side of HesS, is marked by a staff and broom. Erkndflue, which lies 6 cables from the north-west point of HesS, is marked by an iron pole. Nordtaren is a 4-fathom patch lying 2 cables south-westward of ErknSflue ; the sea breaks on it occasionally when the wind is on-shore. Stdbakflue, off the north-east side of GodS, is marked by a staff and broom. LIGHTS. \u2014 The three following lights on the north side of Bred Sund are exhibited from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. HogSten. \u2014 Hogsten lighthouse, a white stone tower with a red roof on the south-eastern extreme of GodS, exhibits at an elevation of 35 feet, a fixed white light, varied by a flash every three minutes, and visible 12 miles in clear weather.

Alnses. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 25 feet, and visible 8 miles from the bearing N.E. by E. through east, south, and west to N.W. by W., is exhibited from Aln\u00e6s, a low point projecting from the north side of GodS ; it is intended as a guide for the entrance to Gisko Sund. SynSBS and Erknd. \u2014 A fixed white light is shown from Syn\u00e6s, the south-western extreme of VikerS ; it is elevated 24 feet, and should be visible 8 miles when bearing from W.N.W. through north and east to S. by W. i W. A fixed red light, elevated 145 feet, and visible 8 miles from the bearing N. by E. f E. through east and south to W. \\ S., is shown from the middle of ErknS or Erkna, a lofty islet lying 2 miles north-westward of Syn\u00e6s. Syn\u00e6s and ErknS lights are exhibited from the 25th of January to the 8th of April, and were established for the guidance of those engaged in the spring cod fishing. Pilots may be obtained from GodS, GiskS, VikerS, Valderhaug, and Aalesund. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Valderhaug, at lOh. 15m.

DIRECTIONS. \u2014 As already mentioned, Sukkertoppen on HesS kept well open southward of GodS leads clear up to the entrance to Bred Sund. After passing about half a mile southward of GodS give Hogsten a berth of 4 or 5 cables, pass 2 or 3 cables westward of the beacon on ErknSflue, and steer for the south-east point of ValderS. Valderhaug Strand. \u2014 If bound for the anchorage at Valderhaug strand, give the south point of ValderS a berth of 2 cables, and bring up about 1^ cables from the shore, in from 8 to 10 fathoms, as soon as Val derhaug lighthouse bears westward of N.N.W. There are oply 2 fathoms within half a cable, and 6 to 7 fathoms at about one cable from the south-east side of ValderS ; at a distance of 2 cables from the shore there are 10 to 16 fathoms, and beyond that the depth increases rapidly to the eastward and southward, but more gradually in the direction of the west point of Kverve ; eastward of the lighthouse, the same depths will be found about half a cable nearer the land ; the bottom, which consists of sand and clay, affords good holding ground, but hawsers are usually laid out to the rings on shore. If large vessels are to remain here any time they should be moored with an anchor laid well to the westward, as south-westerly gales send in a heavy sea, and violent squalls sweep down from the high land when the wind is fresh from the westward."], [229, "chap, vin.] 211 BRED SUND. AALESUND is a small town about 1^ miles southward of ValderS. It is very picturesquely situated, and the views from the high land above the town ofthe distant Langs j eld range are exceedingly grand. Although of recent date, Aalesund already carries on a considerable trade with Spain and Italy, the principal exports being dried cod fish.* At the end of 1875 the population was 5,800. In 1876 the value of the imports was 50,000/., and that of the exports 255,555/., the Custom's receipts amount ing to 6,722/. In the same year vessels clearing inwards registered 7,200 tons, and the tonnage of vessels clearing outwards was 13,000 ; sailing vessels belonging to the port represented a tonnage of 4,500, and steam vessels 600 tons. Supplies of provisions and water may be obtained. The harbour, though very small, is well sheltered and secure in all weathers, but the entrance is extremely narrow for large vessels. About three-quarters of a mile westward of Aalesund, and nearly 2 cables from the north-east end of HesS, there are two rocks carrying 2 fathoms. OlSSkjer, a rock bearing about N.N.W. distant half a mile from the entrance to Aalesund harbour, is marked by a black beacon with two white belts, surmounted by a cage. A spit, carrying 2 fathoms, extends one cable eastward from Olsskjer. LIGHT. \u2014 On the west side of the entrance to Aalesund, a fixed red light, elevated 10 feet, and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from a small light house on the mole; it is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. Stenvaag, a creek on the south side of the north-east point of HesS, has anchorage for small craft in 3 to 10 fathoms, and may be entered from the northward or southward ; the 'shoals to be avoided are marked by staff and broom beacons. ENTRANCES north Of BRED SUND.\u2014 Between Bred Sund and LepsS vessels might stand in through GiskS Sund, GiS Sund, or Vikra fiord to ValderS, Aalesund, or the Inner Lead, but it is necessary to determine a vessel's position accurately before venturing in amongst the outlying rocks without a pilot. Outlying dangers. \u2014 The outer shoals off the entrances to the above channels are Kalsboen, Fauskene, and Grundskallen. A vessel will be well to the westward of these dangers as long as RundS lighthouse bears eastward of S.S.W. Kalsboen, a small rocky patch on the north side of the entrance to GiskS Sund, lies 3\\ miles from ErknS, with Langeskjer in * The Aalesund fishermen have adopted the new method of fishing for ' cod invented about 30 years since. Long nets with a large mesh, and about 7 feet deep, are sunk to the hottom of the sea -where the cod feed ; several of these large nets are joined together, the fish become entangled in them, and in this manner a thousand fish are sometimes taken at a single haul. o 2"], [230, "212 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS.

Kalsboen carries from one to 1\u00a3 fathoms, and is nearly always indicated by breakers. Fauskene are four rocks on a 15 to 16 fathom bank about half a mile in diameter ; the shoalest head, over which there are 5 fathoms, lies 5| miles from ErknS, with ErknS lighthouse bearing S.E. by E. + E., and RundS lighthouse bearing S.W. J S. about 10 miles distant ; its position is marked by breakers when there is any swell. Grundskallen, an 8-fathoin patch, on which the sea breaks during heavy gales, lies 6\u00b1 miles from ErknS, with ErknS lighthouse bearing S.E. \u00a3 S. GISKO SUND, between GodS and GiskS, is the channel through which vessels leaving Valderhaug Strand generally put to sea. The small island of GiskS, which lies between GodS aud ValderS, was formerly the seat of one of the most powerful families in Norway, and the remains of the old family chapel are still visible. The north side of the western entrance to GiskS Sound is marked by Rauden rocks, which lie N.N.W. W. 2 miles from Aln\u00e6s lighthouse. Breiflue and Leiafald, two rocks on which the sea nearly always breaks, lie W.S.W. and S.S.E. half a mile from Rauden ; a rocky ledge extends 3* cables in a N.E. by N. direction from Breiflue. About W. by N. f N. 3 miles from Aln\u00e6s, and W.S.W. nearly 2 miles from Rauden, are two rocks carrying 5^ and 8 fathoms. A dangerous reef extends about 2 miles in a N.N.W. direction from GiskS, but its position is marked by ripples or breakers according to the state of the weather. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 ErknS lighthouse bearing northward of East leads southward of Kalsboen ; the south points of GiskS and ValderS in line will lead southward of Breiflue and Leiafald ; and the north point of Havsten, the high islet at the east end of GiskS Sund, bearing northward of S.E. by E. leads southward of the reef off GiskS. The north-west part of GodS, and the south side of GiskS, must be given a berth of 2 or 3 cables, and after passing between GiskS and Havsten, course may be altered for the most convenient anchorage. Anchorage. \u2014 On the south-east side of GiskS is a roadstead with a depth of 11 to 20 fathoms, over sand, at a distance of 3 or 4 cables from the shore ; it may be left with any wind. Small craft will also find anchorage at several places on the west side of ValderS. The rocks north and west of Skjongholm, and north of Hustruhavn, are marked by iron poles. Skjongsflue, a rock carrying 15 feet, lies three-quarters of a mile"], [231, "213 CHAP. VIII.] GISKO SUND \u2014 VIKRA FIORD. eastward of the north point of Havsten, and the same distance south of the west point of Skjongholm. Gidsund Sund, a narrow passage between ValderS and VikerS, has a depth of 12 to 15 feet, and would afford anchorage to small craft. There are entrances north and south of ErknS to the channels between GiskS, VikerS, and ValderS, but they should not be attempted without a pilot on account of the numerous off-lying rocks. VIKRA (VIKERO) or ROALDS FIORD is a somewhat intricate channel between the rocks off VikerS and LepsS. To enter from seaward it is absolutely necessary to make the Storholms, an isolated cluster of lofty islets lying N. by E. 5 miles from ErknS ; on the inner islet is a conspicuous knoll known as Manden (the Man) from its imaginary resemblance to a human figure, and it is impossible to mistake the group when once seen Mellingskjer, a rock lying S. by E. 2\\ miles from the Storholms, is also a useful mark. Vessels should pass about half a mile southward of the Storholms, and 2 cables northward or southward of Knappen rock ; the Rosholms should be given a berth of three-quarters of a mile, but the south side of Fladskjer may be approached to within one cable. The leading marks used by the fishermen would be useless to strangers, and therefore are not given. Anchorage. \u2014 If necessary, vessels might bring up along the whole of the east side of VikerS, at a distance of 2 to 4 cables off shore, but the depth is considerable, and the bottom consists of loose sand ; the best position is 4 or 5 cables from the shore, eastward of Roalds church, in from 15 to 20 fathoms. INNER LEAD. \u2014 From Aalesund and Valderhaug strand, the Inner Lead continues eastward of ValderS, VikerS, and LepsS to HarS fiord, but vessels drawing too much water to cross LepsS-rev must pro ceed northward outside the islands. In the narrow passage between Kjeholm and the sunken rocks off the east side of ValderS there are 16 fathoms ; northward of Oksebaasen or OxbaasS, the depths vary from 37 to 98 fathoms, but decrease rapidly towards LepsS-rev from about a mile northward of Hanene. With the exception of Hanene, a cluster of rocks half a mile northward of GiSsund holm, and the shoals between LepsS and the mainland, this part of the Inner Lead is almost free from dangers, but as the tidal streams are very strong, and the wind baffling and uncertain off the high land, it is advisable to employ a pilot. Beacons. \u2014 There is an iron pillar on the highest of the Hanene rocks, and Haneflue is marked by an iron pole. Lepsd-reV or reef extends from the islets off the south side of LepsS to the mainland, it is composed of shingle, sand, and shells, with"], [232, "214 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS. [CHAP. VIII several rocky heads. There are two buoys on the north side of the navigable channel, which is about 2 cables broad, and a lighthouse has been placed on the south side ; between the buoys and lighthouse the depths vary from 3 to 5\\ fathoms, but at a distance of nearly 3 cables from Gamleimshaug, the point south of the lighthouse, there are only 2 fathoms. LIGHT. \u2014 From a lighthouse, painted white, erected on the head of the mole which extends from Gamleimshaug, south side of the channel lying south of LepsS, a fixed light is exhibited, showing white between the bearings of N. 68\u00b0 E., through east and south to S. 39\u00b0 W., red between the bearings of S. 39\u00b0 W. and S. 59\u00b0 W., and white between S. 59\u00b0 W. and S. 68\u00b0 W. ; it is elevated 23 feet above the sea, and shouid be visible in clear weather from a distance of 9 miles. This light will be exhibited from 1st of August to 15th of May. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels should pass within one cable of the west side of Kjeholm, the small islet eastwards Valderhaug, in order to avoid the 4 and 5 fathom patches lying westward of that islet, or if turning through, they may stand to the eastward and pass between Kjeholm and Oxbaaso (Oxsebaasen). The west side of GiSsundholm and Hanene rocks should be given a berth of at least 3 cables, and course may then be altered to pass about 4 cables westward of Gamleimshaug, and half-way between the buoys on LepsS-rev and LepsS lighthouse to HarS fiord or Mi fiord. Anchorage. \u2014 In addition to the roadsteads eastward of Valderhaug and VikerS, temporary anchorage may be found opposite the mooring rings on the north side of Oxsebaasen'(OxbaasS), in 8 fathoms. INNER FIORDS.\u2014 The inner fiords of the SSndmore district, between Nord fiord and Romsdal, extend for the most part between mountains ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 feet in height, and the scenery on many of them is of a most imposing character. The RSvde and Vartdals fiords, from which several minor branches extend 5 to 15 miles inland, have already been described (page 206). Sulen fiord, a deep clear channel between HarejdS and SulS, connects Bred Sund with the Vartdals and Stor fiords (see also page 206). Stor fiord, with its continuations, extends eastward and southward from Sulen fiord to Hellesylt, a distance of over 70 miles. It is thus de scribed by Mr. W. Mattieu Williams. \" It is a magnificent excursion \" up Stor fiord, the scenery gradually increasing in grandeur, until it \" reaches its climax at the mouth of the Geiranger fiord. The first part \" of the trip, the eastward course through Stor fiord, is the least inte \" resting, the characteristic features developing themselves fully on turning"], [233, "215 CHAP. VIII.] INNER FIORDS. \" southward into Slyngsfiord. This, and its continuation, Sunelvsfiord, \" as well as its side branches, Nordalsfiord and Geirangerfiord, are sea \" paved gullies, lying between rock walls of steep incline, or nearly per \" pendicular, which rise from 1,000 to 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the \" deep salt water.\" \" The hills hereabouts are rich in ironstone. At \" Orskog is a mine, communicating with the fiord by a very steep \" tramway. The herring fishery is evidently the staple industry.\" \" In \" the course of the day we passed a number of farm buildings, some of \" them 2,000 or 3,000 feet above the deep fiord, with a mountain wilder \" ness behind them, and the fearful precipice in front. An incompre \" hensible track, a winding staircase of giddying ledges, somewhere on the \" face of the precipice, leads to a little boat house on the fiord, an invari \" able adjunct to these farms. This in many cases is the only available \" means of communication between these strange Robinson Crusoe settle \" ments and the outer world. The boats that are so carefully protected \" by the boat houses are built above, as there is no beach or footing below, \" and are let down by means of ropes. The launch of a boat down a 2,000 \" or 3,000 feet precipice, without any but the most primitive appliances, \" is not effected without some risk.\" \" The risks of climbing, boat launch \" ing, and those which demand the tethering of the children, are not the \" only special dangers to which these farmers are exposed.\" In 1735, the wave raised by the fall of a mass of rock washed away a church and swept many miles along the fiord, destroying all the boat houses it encountered ; minor masses and avalanches frequently fell. The avalanches occur on the less precipitous rock faces, and are not mere accumulations of ice and snow, but are chiefly made up of trees and fragments of rock, the denudation being due to the incline. \" From morning till night we were winding through an ever changing series of lakes that may be compared with that of Lucerne, but surpass it in all its own especial elements of grandeur.\" \" In Geiranger fiord we have the culmination of the wild grandeur of all the fiords of this region. Its only rival in Norway, I may say in the world, is the N\u00e6rSfiord, which it resembles. Its unmeasured depths are walled by precipices which make a sheer perpendicular plunge of 3,000 to 4,000 feet down its dark surface. Some eagle-nest Crusoe farms are even here ; and gauzy waterfalls pitch from the unseen wilderness above over the sharp upper edge of the crag, and proceed downwards with a curiously deliberate and leisurely motion, waving gracefully in the air, or gently grazing the face of the rock.\" \"The 'Seven Sisters' of the Geiranger fiord are beautiful examples of this class of waterfall.* * \" Through Norway with Ladies,\" pp. 262-273."], [234, "216 NORD FIORD TO ROMSDALS ISLANDS.

This branch is also specially noted for the magnificent character of the scenery, the Jakta, Slogen, and Otaala mountains rising abruptly from the fiord to a height of about 5,000 feet. Eastward of Bredsund and Aalesund, there are several small, unimportant inlets, studded with numerous islands of various sizes. EllingsS and Gryte fiords extend about 12 miles inland to the east ward of ValderS, and are separated by the long narrow island EllingsS Bratholmstabben in EllingsS fiord, and Midtfiordflue in Gryte fiord, are marked by iron poles."], [235, "217 CHAPTER IX. ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN Variation in 1880. Romsdals islands 17\u00b0 15' W. | Grip Helen 16\u00b020'W. ROMSDALS ISLANDS * form a somewhat straggling group, stretching along the coast in a north-easterly direction between Bred Sund and Hustad Viken ; they are fronted by dangerous clusters of rocks and shoals, which extend 5 or 6 miles to the northward or westward. Northward of the entrances already described (pp. 211, 212) the principal passages leading in from seaward are Harhams fiord, Nogvid fiord, and Kraak Sund. Within the islands are the HarS and Lyngv\u00e6r fiords, which form the continuation of the Inner Lead from LepsS-rev to Hustad Viken. When approaching Romsdals islands from seaward, it is advisable to keep an offing of nearly 10 miles from the outer islands, until the landmarks are distinctly recognised. ASPECT. \u2014 When approaching Romsdals islands from the westward or north-westward, the three lofty islands LepsS, Harhamso, and SkulS or Fl\u00e6mso, will appear to be separated by channels of nearly the same width as the islands themselves. BISkallen mountain on Mien island is very high and jagged. About 5 miles southward of BISkallen is Skj\u00e6 ringen mountain, 3,600 feet high ; it has a hollow in the top like a saddle, is visible nearly 40 miles, and presents much the same appearance when viewed from different positions. Stortinderne, or Brustinderne, a cluster of pointed peaks nearly 7 miles farther inland, attain an elevation of nearly 4,000 feet. OtterSen, to the eastward of BISkallen, is a long, lofty, and almost level island, declining abruptly at each end, and between the east end of OtterSen and the mainland is a very remarkable opening known as SSe Eggen, through which the land within may be seen to a great dis tance. The sharp pointed mountain Romsdalshorn, 5,100 feet high, can only be seen when in line with Ona and SandS, and is then a very im portant landmark ; though a long distance inland it may be seen from a position 25 or 30 miles beyond Ona. North-eastward of SSe Eggen is Jendems fjeld, which though not more lofty than the rest of the coast is conspicuous from its perfectly round form. Skalten mountain between * See Admiralty charts :\u2014 Norway, west coast, sheets III. and IV., Stav fiord to Romsdals islands, No. 2,305, and Romsdals islands to Hitteren island, No. 2,306."], [236, "218 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. Jendems fjeld and Stemshesten, has singularly pointed summits like in verted icicles ; the mountains in its vicinity are nearly all round and level. Gule-bierg (fjeld), or Bud fjeld, is only 470 feet high, but rises from a level plain, and is conspicuous from its detached position ; it has an almost flat summit, and presents much the same appearance from different points of view. LIGHTS. \u2014 Ona. \u2014 On Ona Kalv, a rock off the north-west extreme of Ona, stands an iron lighthouse painted red 48 feet high, from which is exhibited, at an elevation of 128 feet, a fixed white light, varied by a red flash every half minute. The light is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May, and in clear weather should be visible for a distance of 18 miles in all directions. Ulla. \u2014 At the fishing station of Ulla a fixed white light, elevated 56 feet, and visible 8 miles from the bearing of N.E. by E. through east, south, and west, in towards Ulle-sund, is exhibited from the 25th of January to the 8th of April. The lighthouse stands on Kv\u00e6rnholm, a small islet off the north-western extreme of HarhamsS. Ulla light was established chiefly for the guidance of fishermen, but might also be useful to northward bound vessels ; it is about half-way between the entrances to Harhams and Nogvid fiords. Pilots. \u2014 The pilot stations in the Romsdals islands, northward of VikerS, are HarhamsS, Ulla, HarS, SandS, and Ona. Tides and Currents. \u2014 From Bred Sund to SmSlen, and also] as far north as Halten islands, the main stream of flood sets about E.N.E. though its regular course is often varied by the curves of the coast and the direction of the various channels. Outside the islands the flood stream sets north-east, or more northerly, and the ebb south-west. During strong westerly winds both streams set to the north-eastward ; while, if it blows steadily from the east, the tidal current sets westward, its velocity being, however, considerably diminished by the flood stream. It is high water, full and change, off the outer Romsdals islands at Xh. 45m. ; springs rise from 6 to 7 feet, according to the state of the weather, the highest tides being caused by westerly gales. The current sets stronger and more generally to the north-east than in any other direction, especially at a distance of 30 to 60 miles from the land ; great care is therefore necessary, when bound for any particular inlet, to avoid being carried to leeward of it, especially at a late season of the year, during long nights or dark weather, or with the wind at south and west. HAR-AMS and NOGVID FIORDS\u2014 Harhams fiord, be- tween LepsS and HarhamsS, and Nogvid fiord, between Fl\u00e6mso and Fjertoft,"], [237, "CHAP. IX.] HARHAMS AND N0GVID FIORDS. 219 are good entrances to the Inner Lead and Molde for vessels drawing too much water to cross LepsS-rev. There is no passage through Ulle-sund ; but the rocks BjSrnebo, Angletaren, and Smaaskjerene. off Kv\u00e6rnholm and Ulleholmen, are marked by iron poles for the guidance of fishermen. Skreja and Skalmen are two dangerous rocks to the westward of HarhamsS. Skreja lies W. by N.fN. 5 miles from Ulla lighthouse, with the Storholms just open westward of RundS Hest mountain on RundS. Skalmen lies W. by N. \u00a3 N. 3\u00a3 miles from Ulla lighthouse, with the west side of Syn\u00e6sfjeld on VikerS touching the east side of the mountain on GodS. Clearing marks. \u2014 Ea fjeld, the westernmost knoll on the island Fj\u00e6rtoft, open northward of Fl\u00e6msS, or the south point of Fjertoft, in line with or just open northward of the north point of Fl\u00e6msS, will lead north ward of Skreja and Skalmen ; and Roppehorn on Hareidland, open west of the Storholms, or ErknS in line with the steep south-west side of GodS, will lead westward. Flemsboen, a rock carrying 9 feet, lies N. by E. 1^ miles from Kv\u00e6rnholm, with the western steep slope of the mountain on LepsS shut in with the east side of the high land on ValderS. DANGERS WEST Of HARO\u2014 When standing in from sea- ward towards Nogvid fiord, great care must be taken to avoid the extensive cluster of shoals lying westward of HarS. Most of these dangers are indicated by breakers when there is any swell, but it is dangerous to stand into the deep water between them on account of the current setting to wards the reefs. The outermost of the shoals off HarS is a 5 fathom patch (Havflua) lying W. \\ N. 9| miles from Ona lighthouse, and N. N. E. \\ E. 8 miles from Ulla lighthouse. An extensive shoal, on which there are several rocks with but little water over them, lies about 6 cables E.S.E. of Havflua ; it is known as HarSfaldene Storeskallen, a rock carrying 3 fathoms, lies N.N.E. from Ulla lighthouse distant 5 miles. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 If bound into Harhams fiord from the south ward, pass one or 2 miles westward of the Storholms, and steer about N.N.E. until the south point of Fjertoft is open north of the north point of Fl\u00e6msS, which will lead northward of Skreja and Skalmen. When Harhams KlSvning rock is in line with the west point of LepsS and the east point of VikerS, the small islet HestS will be just visible clear of StSlet, the north-east point of LepsS ; the latter mark leads clear up to the entrance, and when past the point of HarhamsS, on which the church stands, proceed through the fiord, keeping rather nearest the land on the north side. After passing RSdsholm (which lies E. by S. \\ S. 3| miles"], [238, "220 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN* [chap. ix. from Ostn\u00e6s), at a distance of 2 or 3 cables, course may be altered as neces sary for the Inner Lead or Mi fiord.' If bound for Nogvid fiord, proceed as directed above until Harhams KlSvning is in line with the west point of LepsS, or until the entrance to Harhams fiord is j ust closed ; then steer so as to pass half a mile northward of Ulleholmen and Kieholm, and proceed in mid-channel through the passage. If approaching from the westward, the openings of Harhams fiord and Nogvid fiord should both be kept open until the west point of LepsS is in line with the east point of VikerS, when the south point of Fjertoft may be brought a little open of the north point of Fl\u00e6msS as already directed. Vessels may, if necessary, pass between Flemsboen and Sv\u00e6rslingerne with Skara fjeld shut in with the north-east point of Fl\u00e6msS, bearing about S.E. 1 S. When beating into Nogvid fiord vessels may stand towards the rocks on the north side of the entrance, until the southern steep edge of BISkallen is in line with the south point of Fjertoft ; and when within the entrance to the fiord, the land on either side may be approached to within 2 or 3 cables. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 At the east end of Harhams fiord, there is anchor age in the bight between LepsS and the islets to the eastward ; and off Ostn\u00e6s, the south-east point of HarhamsS, is a convenient roadstead, with a depth of 6 fathoms over a level sandy bottom. Vessels may anchor on the south-east side of Fl\u00e6msS in 6 to 8 fathoms ; but they will have only 4 fathoms under the stern when swung towards the shore.* Anchorage may also be found along the whole of the east side of HarS in from 5 to 12 fathoms ; care must however be taken to avoid Huseflue and Harn\u00e6sflue, two rocks off the north-eastern part of HarS ; they are both marked by iron poles. Haav\u00e6r Sund, a narrow channel between S\u00e6terS and Haav\u00e6ret, should not be attempted by large vessels without the aid of a pilot. The outer rocks on either side of the entrance from seaward are Horsfaldene and Remboen, on both of which the sea breaks. A vessel will be northward of I he dangers off HarS, when the cleft in Skara-fjeld is open eastward of the northernmost of the two knolls on Fjertoft, and may then haul in towards Ona. Haav\u00e6r summit, in line with SSe Eggen, leads northward of Lonfaldene ; but SSe Eggen inline with the south point of Ona will lead on Remboen, and must therefore be kept well open southward of Ona. The south side of Ballene rocks may be passed at a distance of about half a mile. * Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Racoon, 1864."], [239, "CHAP. IX.] HARHAMS FIORD \u2014 LYNGV\u00c6R FIORD. 221 There is a small harbour, with a depth of 6 fathoms, between the east side of SandS aud Earstencn. RSdholmsten off SandS, and Oterholmtaren in Ona havn, are marked by iron poles. Kippen and Galler Skjerene. \u2014 Kippen, the northernmost rock of the Romsdals islands, shows well above water, and is clean close-to on the north side, but about one mile to the north-eastward is a patch carrying o to 9 fathoms. A shoal carrying 3 fathoms lies 3 cables north-east of Kippen. About a mile southward of Kippen is the cluster of rocks known as Galler Skjerene, on one of which stands a stone beacon. The rocks extending 11 miles westward from Kippen, and half a mile east ward of Galler Skjerene, are nearly always marked by breakers. Kraak Sund, is a good inlet between Ona and Galler Skjerene. When a vessel is about 4 miles northward of Ona the islets RSstholm and OterS will be distinguished, as well as several rocks to the northward and westward of them, which lie on the south side of the channel. On the north side of the entrance will be seen Kippen, with two small rocks close to it, aud the islets of Salstenen, Klovningen, and Aamunden. Kraaka, a rock on the south side of the fairway, is marked by an iron pillar, and KISvningen rock is distinguished by a deep cleft. The leading marks for the entrance to Kraak Sund are Lyngv\u00e6r in line with Hegdals Skaaret (the first cleft or dell in the high land on OtterSen, south of SSe Eggen), or SSe Eggen well open west of Aamundskjer. Vessels may pass from one to 2 cables northward of Kraaka. LYNGV\u00c6R FIORD\u2014 Eastward of Galler Skjerene is the entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r fiord, which lies between the northernmost Romsdals islands and the islets off Gorsen, and is the best entrance to Molde and the Inner Lead from the northward. Pilots may be obtained from BjSrnsund and Gorsen island. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 82 feet, and visible 9 miles from E. by N. through south to N.N.W. \\ W., is exhibited from the eastern part of MoSen in BjSrnsund, from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. Dangers Off Bud. \u2014 A range of rocks and shoals extends 2 to 3 miles from the mainland eastward of Bud, the point on the east side of the entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r fiord. The outermost of these dangers are a 4^-fathoms patch lying one mile N. \\ W. from the western small holms off Bud ; Terningen rock, which breaks heavily even in calm weather ; and a 3-fathom patch N.N.E. \\ E. \\\\ miles from Terningen. Skaarflue is a 6-fathom patch about 8 cables N.N.E! from the holms eastward of Ternin gen ; the visible rocks eastward of Skaarflue may be approached to within 3 or 4 cables."], [240, "222 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. BjSrnsund lighthouse bearing S.S.W. J W. leads westward of the dano-ers off Bud, and Kvitholm lighthouse in line with Freikollen mountain bearing E. by S., leads northward. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When bound into Lyngv\u00e6r fiord vessels must not approach the visible rocks of Galler Skjerene nearer than 2 miles, until Gule Bierg is in line with Skalten mountain, bearing S.E. \\ E. This mark will lead northward of all the dangers on the west side of the entrance\", and when about half-way between Galler Skjerene and Terningen, the bearings of Ona lighthouse and SandS church will be sufficient guide for the passage between Lyngv\u00e6r and SandS, where pilots will always be found. The dangers within the entrance are either visible or close to the islets, with the exception of a line of rocks extending about half a mile east and west, which lie 4 cables northward of Orholm. Bud.* \u2014 Iu fine weather vessels may bring up southward ofthe trading station at Bud, but the anchorage is exposed to the westward ; a red buoy has been moored off the houses by Mr. Olsen, the proprietor of the station. When entering, vessels should pass 3 cables southward of the outer rocks westward of Bud. The passage within the rocks, northward of Bud, can only be used by those acquainted with the locality. Supplies of provisions may be obtained here, and good water may be procured from a stream near the parsonage. Bjdrnsund Havn affords only indifferent anchorage, and the entrance is difficult, it should not therefore be attempted by strangers. Skolten rock is marked by an iron pillar, and there are two sunken rocks carrying iron poles. HardSUUd Havn, the entrance to which bears S.E. by E., 31 miles from BjSrnsund lighthouse, is a small but good and safe harbour. Aspholm is marked by a stone beacon with pole and cage, and Kraakaflue has an iron pole on it. INNER LEAD. \u2014 The Inner Lead continues from LepsS-rev through the HarS and Lyngv\u00e6r fiords to Hustad Viken. From the northern end of Lyngv\u00e6r fiord to SmSlen island, on the north side of Trondhjems Lead, a distance of about 40 miles, there is no inshore route. the scattered islets off that part of the coast affording little or no protection from the open sea. Hard fiord is a spacious and clear channel to the eastward of Fl\u00e6msS, Fjertoft, and HarS. When passing through HarS fiord the land may everywhere be approached to within 2 or 3 cables, with the exception of the islets off the north point of Mien, which must be given a berth of half a mile. * -See plan : \u2014 Approaches to Bud on Admiralty chart, No. 2,306, scale m= 1 -4 inches (in course of preparation)."], [241, "CHAP. IX.] 223 LYNGV\u00c6R FIORD \u2014 MOLDE. There is a wooden beacon on Nordre Hougen (Haugn\u00e6s), on the east side of the south entrance to HarS fiord, 2 miles from the south-east point of HarhamsS ; and an iron pole with two cages on Rogneholm, the islet off the south-east side of Fl\u00e6msS. The southern entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r fiord, between Lyngv\u00e6r and SandS, is nearly one mile broad, and the islets and visible rocks on either side may be approached to within one or 2 cables ; attention must, however, be paid to the set ofthe tides, their velocity and direction varying considerably between the islands. From SandS the course lies eastward of Storskjer, KISvningen, and Gallen Skjerene, and westward of Flesene, Krabben, and BjSrnsund, to Hustad Viken. Besides the anchorages off Fl\u00e6msS, HarS, and SandS, there are several small harbours amongst the islets on the north side of Grunde fiord, between OtterSen and Gorsen, but the approaches are so narrow and intricate that they could only be taken by very small vessels. MOLDE is built upon a promontory on the north side of Molde fiord, though of little commercial importance it is perhaps the most beautifully situated town in Norway, commanding a magnificent view of the extensive snowy ranges of the Dovre and Lang fjelds. In 1874 the population was 1,700. At Vestn\u00e6s, about 6 miles south-westward of Molde, there is a private building yard, where vessels in want of repairs might be accomodated. There is a very fair roadstead between Molde and the islands to the southward, with a depth of from 9 to 16 fathoms. Small vessels might lie alongside the wharves. A buoy is moored in 6 fathoms, about one cable from the shore off the west end of the town. Pilots are stationed at Molde. Dangers. \u2014 With the exception of Mekgrund, a patch carrying 10 feet, which lies W. by N. 7^ cables from BjSrs\u00e6tholm, with the westernmost islet off HjertS bearing S. by E. f E., the approach to Molde is free from dangers. Rekn\u00e6sholm, open northward of BjSrs\u00e6tholm,aleads north ward of Mekgrund, and Molden\u00e6s in line with the north point of BjSrs\u00e6tholm, leads southwards. There are several rocks amoug the islets northward of HjertS, but they lie close inshore. ENTRANCES. \u2014 Vessels bound for Molde may take any of the passages already described, between Bred Sund and Lyngv\u00e6r fiord, according to circumstances and draught of water. Mi fiord is the principal channel leading to Molde from HarS fiord, but there is also a passage through Grunde fiord and Kj\u00e6rringsundet. The north entrance between BjSrnsund and Bud, and through Julsund (the channel eastward of Gorsen and OtterSen) is, generally speaking, the best for vessels drawing"], [242, "224 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. too much water to pass LepsS-rev, as strangers will find it more easy to make the entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r fiord than any of the passages farther southward. Mi fiord, between Mien and the mainland, is about one mile broad, and connects HarS and Molde fiords. A shoal extends one cable from the shore eastward of R\u00e6ka, on the south side of the fiord, Haaskjerflue is a small patch carrying one fathom, which lies W. \u00a3 S. If cables from Haaskjer, the westernmost of the islets and rocks off TauterS ; and the eastern extreme of a shoal with two rocky heads on it carrying 3 fathoms, lies W. by N. 3 cables from the western extreme of TauterS. Maaseskjer, a rock off the eastern extreme of TauterS, is marked by an iron pole ; a shoal spit extends 1^ cables eastward from Maaseskjer. From LepsS-rev or Harhams fiord vessels may pass southward of Rodholm at a distance of 2 or 3 cables, and proceed through Mi fiord and Molde fiord for the roadstead off the town. The entrance from Nogvid and HarS fiords is between RSdsholm and Storholm, an islet off the south-western extreme of Mien. Storholm, R\u00e6ka, and the islets west ward of TauterS should not be approached nearer than 2 cables, and it is advisable to keep rather on the north side of the channel when entering the roadstead, in order to avoid Mekgrund and the rocks off Hjerto. Yachts and small vessels might wait a tide at Hegdalsvik on the south side of OtterSen in 7 fathoms, or between Futholm and the west extreme of TauterS in 1 1 fathoms, but both these anchorages are very small. Grunde fiord and Kj\u00e6rringsundet.\u2014 if bound through Kj\u00e6r- ringsundet, keep Orten open eastward of SandS until the Midtfiord rocks are in line, bearing E. S. southerly, which will lead between the shoals lying on either side of the entrance to Grunde fiord. When Ona lighthouse is well open eastward of Orten, haul to the southward and give Midtfiord rocks a berth of half a mile, in order to avoid Bleja. Pass about 2 cables southward of Kv\u00e6rnholm ; and proceed between Snellen and Semunds holm, and through Kj\u00e6rringsundet, which is free from dangers, to Jul Sundet. There is a small cove at the inner end of Rakvaag with a depth of 7 fathoms ; and temporary anchorage may be found eastward of Restad tangen in 6 fathoms. Jul Sundet. \u2014 The northern entrance to Molde through Ros fiord and Jul Sundet, though not very intricate, is rather narrow for any but small vessels to turn through, and the difficulty is frequently increased by baffling winds and strong tides ; it is therefore advisable to pick up a pilot before standing in between BjSrnsund and Bud."], [243, "CHAP. IX.] 225 MI FIORD \u2014 INNER FIORDS. Dangers. \u2014 With the exception of Kua in Jul Sundet (a rock marked by an iron pillar which lies S.E. by E. i E. nearly 6 cables from the north point of Kj\u00e6rringholm), the dangers in Ros fiord and Jul Sundet lie close to the shore. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Having entered between Galler Skjerene and the dangers off Bud according to the directions for Lyngv\u00e6r fiord (page 222), BjSrnsund lighthouse should be kept between the bearings of S.S.E. and S.S.W. J W. until the church at Bud bears E.S.E., or until a pilot has boarded the vessel. Course may then be altered to pass between Skj\u00e6r lingen and the islets off Bud, giving the latter a good berth ; give HarS, Sesholm, and Stensn\u00e6s a fair berth, and proceed through Ros fiord and Jul Sundet to Molde fiord. Anchorage. \u2014 If southward of HarSsunds Havn, vessels taking the Jul Sundet entrance might bring up for wind or tide at any of the following places ; the depths given are all within one cable of the shore. At Eikrem, on the east side of Gorsen, 3 miles southward of HarSsunds Havn, there is a depth of from 27 to 16 fathoms. A rock on the south side of the entrance to the bight is marked by an iron pole. On the north side of the entrance to Fr\u00e6nen fiord there are from 14 to 3 fathoms ; and N.N.E. of VaagS church, on the south side of the fiord, there is a small cove with a depth of 8 fathoms. On the south side of AkerS-bugt there is anchorage in 6 fathoms, with the church bearing N.E. by N. ; and southward of AkerSholm, with the church bearing E. N., there are 7 fathoms. Mordalsvaag, which has a depth of 10 to 5 fathoms, and the cove within HaukebSholm, where there are 4 fathoms, are only fit for very small vessels. INNER FIORDS. \u2014 Romsdals fiord, with its various branches, penetrates a considerable distance inland eastward of Romsdals islands. The principal branch extends about 16 miles to the southward and east ward from S\u00e6kken island ; and near the inner end, on the south side, is the well known station Veblungsn\u00e6s, a village of 40 or 50 houses. Lang fiord extends about 15 miles eastward from VeS ; and the inner end of Fane fiord is 15 miles eastward of Molde. Fanestranden, the northern shore of Fane fiord, is noted for its luxuriant vegetation and great beauty. Amongst the minor branches, Tres fiord, the entrance to which is about 6 miles southward of Molde, is considered the finest ; there are various small anchorages in all these fiords. Pilots may be obtained at Molde. The depths in Romsdal fiord vary very considerably, the greatest yet found being 250 fathoms at the southern entrance to Jul Sunden, and 233 fathoms in the main branch of the fiord southward of S\u00e6kken. K 740. p"], [244, "226 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [CHAP. IX. The whole of the Romsdal district is celebrated for its magnificent scenery, and affords excellent sport. Rauma river, in which there is good salmon fishing, falls into Romsdals fiord a short distance eastward of Veblungsn\u00e6s. ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO TRONDHJEMS LEAD. From Bud to the south side of the entrance to Trondhjems Lead, a distance of 30 miles, the outer coast line trends about E. by N. and is fronted by clusters of small islets and rocks extending between 7 and 8 miles off shore. Between these groups there are several passages leading in from seaward to Kristiansund, viz., Fugleleden (to the eastward of Hustad Viken), Ravn Gab, the Trefl\u00e6sa channel, and GriphSlen. KRISTIANSUND is built on three islands, Kirkeland, Indland, and NordlandsS, and forms almost a circle round its beautiful land-locked harbour. It stands on such irregular ground that scarcely any two houses are on the same level, and the streets are singularly steep and crooked. The houses are built of wood, painted red, white, or yellow ; and the appearance of the town and harbour with its numerous wharves and ware houses, varied by groups of shipping, is extremely picturesque. Wheu approaching from seaward no houses can be seen until the vessel is close to the entrance. The commercial importance of Kristiansund is fast increasing ; the population at the end of 1875 was 7,500. In 1876 the value of the im ports was 122,222/., and that of the exports 672,222/., the Customs receipts amounting to 20,611/. The exports consist chiefly of \" Klip-fish,\" or dried cod, large quantities of which are sent to Spain. In 1876 the tonnage of vessels clearing inwards amounted 17,900 tons, while those clearing outwards registered 28,500 tous. In the same year the sailing vessels belonging to the port registered 10,500 tons, and the steam vessels 600 tons. Supplies. \u2014 Supplies can be obtained at Kristiansund ; and large vessels can be accommodated if in want of repairs. Water is procured from floating tanks. An English vice-consul is resident. Anchorage. \u2014 Kristiansund harbour affords good anchorage in 16 to 20 fathoms, the depth decreasing to 8 fathoms towards the northern shore ; it is sheltered from all winds, and may be entered either from the westward or north-eastward. When entering the harbour every vessel must have shore hawsers ready for laying out if required. Tides. \u2014 It is high water full and change at Kristiansund at lOh. 44m. Springs rise 6 to 7 feet. Pilots are stationed at Kristiansund."], [245, "CHAP. IX.] 227 KRISTIANSUND \u2014 HUSTAD VIKEN. LIGHTS. \u2014 Lervik.\u2014 A fixed white light, visible 6 miles, is exhi bited at Lervik on the south side of SSrsund, the western entrance to Kristiansund, from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. Kvitn\u00e6s. \u2014 A fixed fight is also exhibited, at an elevation of 56 feet, from a white building on the extremity of Kvitn\u00e6s, a projecting point on the south side of the north-eastern entrance to Kristiansund. The fight shows red between the bearings of E.N.E. and S.E. by S. (the bearing S.E. by S. leading eastward of Haaskjer) ; white between S.E. by S. and S. by W. W. (the bearing S. by W. \u00a7 W. leading about 3 cables west ward of Golmodden), and red between S. by W. \u00a7 W. and W.S.W. It is visible 9 miles in clear weather, and is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. ENTRANCES. \u2014 Before continuing the description of the coast northward of the Romsdals islands, it is considered advisable to recapi tulate the various entrances to Kristiansund and Trondhjems Lead. When bound to Kristiansund or Trondhjem from the southward, strangers are recommended, as a general rule, to make RundS and Bred Sund ; in some cases, however, such as with a fair wind and fine clear weather, it would be a waste of time to stand in so far to the south ward. Should a vessel make the land about the parallel of Stadt and be unable to fetch the entrance to Bred Sund, she might stand in for Vanelvs Gab or Flaav\u00e6r and proceed northward through the Inner Lead. The entrances between Bred Sund and Lyngv\u00e6r fiord, though often useful to those possessing local knowledge, should not be attempted by strangers without the assistance of a pilot, except in clear weather or in cases of necessity. With care and attention to the following directions the bearings of Kvitholm and Stavn\u00e6s lighthouses will be sufficient guide for Hustad Viken, Fugleleden, Ravn Gab, and the Trefl\u00e6sa channel. GriphSlen should not be attempted unless the weather is sufficiently clear for the landmarks to be distinguished. The entrances northward of SmSlen are RamsS fiord, FrSi fiord, and Fro Havet. HUSTAD VIKEN and FUGLELEDEN\u2014 Hustad Viken is the open space off that part of the coast between Gule bierg and Stemshesten. At the east end of Hustad Viken is the entrance to the channel known as Fugleden. Landmarks. \u2014 Kvitholm, an islet lying about 12 miles eastward of the north entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r fiord and 1^ miles from the foot of Stems hesten, is very conspicuous, being lofty, pointed, and perfectly white. On the north-west point stands a white circular stone lighthouse 99 feet high, which is the most important landmark to strangers on this part of the coast. The new church at Husted is also a conspicuous object. p 2"], [246, "228 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [CHA1\\ IX. LIGHTS. \u2014 Kvitholm.\u2014 From the 1st of August to the 15th of May, Kvitholm lighthouse exhibits at an elevation of 128 feet, a fixed white light varied every minute by a flash of 1 2 seconds duration ; in clear weather the light should be visible 18 miles from the bearing of N.N.E. A E., through east, south, and west to N.W., but appears eclipsed between the flashes beyond the distance of 8 miles. StavnaSS. \u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 59 feet, is shown from the gable end of a yellow house on Stavn\u00e6s, the north-east point of AverS, from the 1st of August to the I5th of May. The fight should be visible 9 miles from the bearing of E.S.E. through south and west to N.W. W., and marks the west side of the western entrance to Kristiansund. Pilots. \u2014 SmSrholm, an islet lying 1\u00b1 miles southeastward of Kvitholm, is the only pilot station between BjSrnsund and Kristiansund. Kroppen is a stony shoal of 3 fathoms, 2 or 3 cables in extent, on which the sea breaks in bad weather ; the centre bears W. by N. N. distant 4 miles from Fuglen, and N.W. by W. W. 6| miles from Kvitholm, with Hustad church bearing S. by E. Fuglen. \u2014 This rock, which lies N.W. 2-/^ miles from Kvithom, is marked by a stone beacon ; the south-eastern extreme of Midtflue, which carries 2 fathoms, lies S.E. \\ E. lT\\y miles from Fuglen. Follingen is one of the Olan or Myholniene ; it lies N.E. by E. f E. 3 miles from Fuglen, and N. by E. \\ E. 3^ miles from Kvitholm. There is a square stone beacon about 15 feet high on Follingen. Bjogna, a sunken rock on which the sea breaks continually, lies N.E. by E. 1 E. 2 miles from Kvitholm, and N.W. \\ N. one mile from Tromskjer ; it is steep-to all round, and may be passed within a distance of 2 cables. Tromskj er, the westernmost ofthe rocks above water off the entrance to LSvS fiord, lies E. \\ N. 2^ miles from Kvitholm lighthouse ; it may be approached to a distance of 2 cables. Bararmene are two sunken rocks lying on a shoal patch which extends about 3 cables E.N.E. and W.S.W. ; the centre of the shoal lies E. \\ S. If miles from Bjogna, and N.E. by E. f E. Ii miles from Tromskjer ; its position is generally indicated by breakers. Myrgrund is a 4-fathom patch on the southern edge of the rocky bank surrounding the Myholms ; the south extreme lies E. by N. i N. l\u00a3s miles from Bjogna, and N.N.E. *- E. 11 miles from Tromskjer. Lille Sortna, the south-easternmost rock above water on the Myholni bank, lies E. by N. 4 miles from Bjogna. Braken, a sunken rock on which the sea frequently breaks, lies about E. J N. 5 miles from Bjogna ; E. \\ S. one mile from Lille Sortna ; aud N.W. about 8 cables from Hestholm."], [247, "CHAP. IX.] 229 HUSTAD VIKEN AND FUGLELEDEN. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 If bound into Hustad Viken and Fugleleden from the southward, give Gallar Skjerene a berth of at least 2 miles, bring Kvitholm lighthouse to bear E.S.E., and steer direct for it on that bearing until within 2 miles distance of Kvitholm. Svartoksen, a small round black rock about 2\u00a3 miles westward of Kvitholm, will then bear S.S.W. i W., and course must be altered to E. -i N. The course E. \u00a3 N. made good for 4 miles will lead 2 or 3 cables northward of Bjogna, but if this rock should be seen breaking ahead, it is better to pass northward of it. From a position 2 or 3 cables northward of Bjogna the course is E. 1 N. for about 5 miles, which should lead 2 or 3 cables southward of Braken. After passing about half a mile westward of Hestholm, steer E.N.E. until Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse is in sight ; then steer E. S. until the channel between Stavn\u00e6s and Kirkeland is well open, and proceed for the entrance to SSrsund. When Sorsund is open, steer for Lervig lighthouse, which may be passed quite close, and continue in mid-channel for Kristian sund harbour. If bound through Trondhjems Lead, course should be altered to E. by N. \\ N. when Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse is sighted ; this course made good for 22 miles will carry a vessel between Solv\u00e6rbo, and the rocks off the west end of Tustern, and southward of Jonsskjer, to Ringholm. Between Fuglen and Follingen. \u2014 When standing in for the channel between Fuglen and Follingen, care must be taken not to approach Kvitholm nearer than 7 or 8 miles, until the lighthouse bears eastward of S. | E., in order to avoid coming in amongst the rocks off Myholmene; and it must be borne in mind that the lighthouse bearing S.E. by E.I E.will lead on Kroppen shoal. In order to enter the channel, bring Kvitholm lighthouse to bear S.S.E., and steer for it, edging so much to the eastward that the lighthouse shall bear S. \\ E. when one mile distant ; then steer E. 1 N., and proceed as directed above. From Lyngv\u00e6r fiord. \u2014 From a position about half- way between BjSrnsund and the Galler rocks, steer N.N.E. \u00a7 E., taking care to keep BjSrnsund lighthouse bearing eastward of S.S.W. | W. until Kvitholm is in line with Freikollen mountain, bearing E. by S. The vessel will then be northward ofthe dangers off Bud, and may close Kvitholm on an E. by S. bearing until Svartoksen bears S.E. \\ S. distant one mile, when course must be altered to E. \\ N. according to the foregoing directions. At night.* \u2014 Strict attention must be paid to the steering when passing through Fugleleden at night, and great caution must be observed when nearing Bjogna and Braken. Having entered the channel accord ing to the directions already given, a sharp look out must be kept for Bjogna, which will be 2 or 3 cables distant when Kvitholm bears S.W. \\ W. ; the sound of the breakers will however generally indicate the * See also page 231."], [248, "230 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. position of the rock. After passing Bjogna, it will be safer to continue on the course E. | N. until Hest islet is within a distance of 2 or 3 cables ; and the islands off Bremsn\u00e6s should be passed at a distance of 4 or 5 cables. After sighting Stavn\u00e6s light, steer E. | S. until the light bears S.E. by S., when course must be altered to round Stavn\u00e6s. When past the point, which is clean close-to, the course is S.E. \u00a3 S. to the south eastern limit of Stavn\u00e6s light ; and from thence S.S.E. E. until Lervig light bears E. \u00a3 S., which will lead well into the entrance to SSrsund. Anchorage. \u2014 Within the islet SmSrholm, \\\\ miles south-eastward of Kvitholm, there is a harbour where vessels bound to the north-eastward might wait for a fair wind ; a rock in SmSrholmens Havn is marked by an iron pole. There is a passage leading southward of Svartoksen and Kvithom to SmSrholm, which might be used by small vessels. Uhrvaag, is a creek in LangS, which outward bound vessels may warp into, when forced to anchor during calms on account of the strong currents ; the entrance is rather narrow and inconvenient. RAVN GAB, the inlet between Mybolmene and the cluster of rocky islets named Ravnene, is a deep clear channel 2 miles broad, but as some local knowledge is required to distinguish the leading marks it is not much used by strangers. If approaching the entrance to Ravn Gab from the westward, Ravnene and the Myhohns will appear to be in the same cluster ; but after passing the outer visible rocks of the Myholm group at a distance of 2 or 3 miles the opening will be distinctly seen. Freikollen mountain in hue with the south-western Ravn rock, bearing S.E. E., will lead to the entrance ; when Kvitholm lighthouse bears S.S.W. f W., Stor Sortna will bear S.S.E. distant 4 miles. Steer direct for Stor Sortna on a S.S.E. bearing, until the north extreme of Bremsn\u00e6s bears E. by S. ; then steer E. S. about 7 miles, taking care to give Bremsn\u00e6s a berth of half a mile, and when Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse bears S.E. by S., proceed for Kristiansund. LIGHT. \u2014 A light is exhibited from a lighthouse erected on Hest (Hestsj\u0153r) islet : \u2014 The light, is visible seaward between the bearings E. by N. (through south) and W. by S. \u00a7 S., showing fixed white through the navigable channels, and either flashing while (short eclipses every alternate second), or fixed red over dangerous ground ; it is elevated 72 feet above the sea, and should be seen in clear weather from a distance of 15 miles. The sectors of light are shown as follows, viz. : \u2014 1. Fixed white in the channel between Tromskarene and Bararmene, the limits leading about one cable's distance clear of those shoals, also clear to the northward of the rocks extending from the shore, and southward of Hallaren shoal \u2014 Kvithholm light is nearly in tho centre of this sector."], [249, "CHAP. IX.] RAVN GAB \u2014 HEST LIGHT. 231 Vessels approaching from the westward, and seaward of Kvithholm, should keep near the northern limit of this white sector, until past Langbaken shoal (about half a mile eastward of Kvithholm). 2. Flashing white from one cable south of Baramene, to half a cable's length northward of Bjogna rocks. 3. Fixed white in the channel, northward of sector 2, to one cable's length southward of Myrgrund and Midtfluen (the southern edge of Fuglevingerne with a depth of 5 fathoms on it). Approaching from the westward, when within the limits of this white sector, steer for the light on about an E. \\ N. course ; but with a heavy sea, keep near its northern limit in order to clear the foul ground of 8 or 9 fathoms water, off Hustad \u2014 Coming from the northward, and nearing Fuglen, Kvithholm light should be steered for till within this white sector of Hest fight, when the course should be altered for that light. 4. Fixed red northward of sector 3, to 2 cables' lengths eastward of Grundkampen (where the depth is 8 fathoms). 5. Fixed white in the Ravngab (Ravneleden), north-eastward of sector 4, to one cable's length westward of Ravnene (Syd-Ravn). The mid-channel course through the Ravngab is S. E. S ; but under ordinary circumstances, the light may be steered for when bearing S. E., as Grundkampen only breaks with a heavy sea. 6. Flashing white north-eastward of sector 5, to one cable's length eastward of Muen \u2014 a shoal which always breaks. 7. Fixed white in Kraakeleden, eastward of sector 6. to one cable's length westward of Kraaken rock.\" The mid-channel course through Kraakeleden is S. \\ W., but before entering this white sector, mariners must be sure of being southward of Griptarene (Nattergalene). 8. Fixed red south eastward of sector 7, to three or four cables' lengths south-east of Fausken shoal, and the innermost rocks (Disken and Hilboen) of Indgrip (Indgripene). 9. Fixed ichite in the channel south-eastward of sector 8, to two cables' lengths northward of Hammersundsverne (Golmodden). To clear Solv\u00e6rbo, vessels must keep near the southern limit of this white sector. Stavn\u00e6s and Kvitholm lights serve to guide clear of dangers at Engelen and RSdeggan. Note. \u2014 As the channels indicated by the fixed white light (especially by sectors 1 and 3) are very narrow \u2014 Mariners should bear in mind the character of the sector on each side of the channel they are navigating. Bjogna rock always breaks, and the noise may generally be heard at a warning distance. Bararmene usually breaks."], [250, "232 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. Hallaren, situated nearly midway between Bjogna rock and Hest islet has 2 fathoms water over it. Northward of Hest islet a shelf extends to the distance of one cable, with a depth of 5 fathoms ; vessels therefore should pass at a sufficient distance \u2014 avoiding also Braka (Braken) rock, lying W.N.W. distant one mile from Hest islet, and which always breaks. The light tower, square in shape with dwelling attached, is painted white. This light is exhibited from 1st August to 15th May following. TREFL\u00c6SA CHANNEL, between Ravnene and the Grip islets, is more generally used than any of the other entrances to Kristian sund, the passage between the rocks being very short and straight, though only 6 cables broad in the narrowest part. On the south side of the channel are the Skj\u00e6ringen rocks, above water, and Midtfiordfald, which breaks constantly ; and on the north side are Trefl\u00e6sa or Treflessen, and Kraaka, both of which are visible. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing 2 or 3 miles northward of Myhol mene and Ravnene, Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse, or light, must be brought S.E. by S. ; this bearing will lead through the channel and up to Stavn\u00e6s. Caution. \u2014 Great care must be taken not to stand too far to the north ward and eastward before entering the channel, on account of Griptarene reef, and Sigrund shoal, which carries one foot, and lies W. f S. nearly 3 miles from GripS, and N. by W. | W. 2 miles from Trefl\u00e6sa. A rock carrying 3 fathoms lies S.W. by W. \\ W. 21 cables from Sigrund. Fausken, a 2-fathom patch about a mile southward of the Indgrip islands, is marked by a buoy with pole and cage. If bound into Trondhjems Lead from Trefl\u00e6sa channel, vessels should pass southward of Fausken, and proceed between Solv\u00e6rbo and the rocks off Tustern as directed on page 229. GRIPHOLEN. \u2014 On the northern side of Trefl\u00e6sa channel, are the Grip and Indgrip islands, two clusters of barren rocky islets surrounded by rocks and shoals ; they must be approached with great caution. Grip hSlen, the principal southern entrance to Trondhjems Lead, is a deep pit or hole between the Grip islands and the scattered rocks off the south side of SmSlen. The depths in Gripholen vary from 100 to 152 fathoms, and decrease rapidly on every side to between 50 and 60 fathoms. COAST. \u2014 In the vicinity of GriphSlen the coast may be easily recog nised by the mountains ; of these Stemshesten and Tustern are the most conspicuous, being visible in tolerably clear weather at a distance of 40 to 50 miles. The land between them stretches about E. by N. and W. by S., and from a distance appears low and indistinct like the inner shore of a gulf, of which the mountains seem to form the extreme points. Stemshesten is an imposing headland 1,790 feet high, it is about 2"], [251, "233 CHAP. IX.] TREFL\u00c6SA CHANNEL \u2014 GRIPTARENE. miles long N. by W. and S. by E., and fully a mile broad ; when seen from the northward, it has the appearance of a clump with three circular summits, and from that point of view stands out like a large detached promontory. Rensfjeld, about 12 miles southward of Kristiansund, is lofty and steep, having on the summit a hump like the crown of a hat. Mangilbjerg, about 7 miles E.S.E. from Kristiansund, though not so lofty as the other mountains, is very remarkable, the eastern side sloping pre cipitously to the sea, and the top having three jagged peaks which can be distinguished at a great distance. Freikollen is a lofty and remarkable mountain 4 miles south of Kristiansund. GripS, the principal of the Grip islands, is an object that cannot be mistaken ; it is a low island surrounded by islets and rocks, and though only about 3 cables in diameter is very populous, and has a church with a small spire. SmSlen, with the numerous islets and rocks surrounding it, is very low in proportion to the other islands and the mainland. Carlsholm is the loftiest, and one of the largest islets of the west side of SmSlen ; it is easily seen to be a separate island, and is a useful object for cross bearings. GRIPTARENE. \u2014 The dangerous rocky bank named Griptarene by the pilots and fishermen of GripS and SmSlen, and Nattergalene \u2014 the Nightingales \u2014 on the old charts, extends about 4 miles east and west, and from l\u00a3 to 2\\ miles north and south. Within this space there are several sunken rocks and shoals on which the depth varies from 6 to 15 fathoms, and one place where there are only 12 feet. Ostklakken, on the north-western edge of the bank, carries 7 fathoms, and lies about 15 miles westward of the west point of SmSlen. Stenen, the south-western shoal spot, carries 6 fathoms, and lies N.W. \\ N. 8\\ miles from GripS. Vest kleppen, the 2-fathom patch, lies near the centre of the bank N.W. JN. 7^ miles from GripS, with the highest part of Stemshesten bearing S.S.W. \\ W., distant 19 miles. The eastern edge of the bank, on which there are 14 to 15 fathoms, lies 11 miles westward of SmSlen, with Freikollen mountain bearing S. by E. \\ E. The sea breaks on these shoals when there is any swell, so that they may be heard and seen at some distance they should nevertheless be ap proached with great caution, and it will be better to avoid this part of the coast unless the weather is sufficiently clear for the leading marks to be distinguished. CLEARING MARKS.\u2014 The northern slope of Tustern bearing E.S.E. or GripS bearing S.E. by E. \\ E. will lead southward of Grip tarene ; Stemshesten bearing S. by W. \\ W. will lead westward ; Carls holm bearing E. by S. will lead northward, and GripS bearing S.S.E. will lead eastward. ROCKS.\u2014 The dangers off GripS extends N.W. f N. 1\\ miles; N.E. by E. \\\\ miles, and E. \\\\ miles."], [252, "234 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. IX. Hilbaaren. \u2014 The eastern rock on Hilbaaren reef lies S.E. f E. 4 miles from GripS, and E. by S. one mile from the north-eastern small islet of the Indgrip cluster, with Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse bearing S.W. \u00a7 S. distant 5^ miles. Gaaseskjer is a rock above water lying E. by N. f N. 3| miles from GripS, and the same distance N.W. by W. W. from the largest island of Solv\u00e6r. The sunken rocks off Gaaseskjer extend N.W. \\ W. 1\\ miles, and the same distance N.W. by N. ; 9 cables N. | W. ; about one mile S.E., and three-quarters of a mile S. by E. Gotaren. \u2014 A line of rocks extends W. by S. \\ S. \\\\ miles from the west point of Solv\u00e6r island ; and about half-way between these and Hilbaaren is a rock known as Gotaren, which carries 8 fathoms, and might break during strong north-westerly gales. Solv\u00e6rbO lies S.E. by S. If miles from the west end of Solv\u00e6r island, it is above water, and is marked by an iron pillar, breaking heavily when there is any swell. A reef extends 3 cables S.W. \\ W., and three-quarters of a mile E. | S. from Solv\u00e6rbo. Rocks off Tustern. \u2014 Rocks and islets extend about \\\\ miles to the northward from Golma and the western part of Tustern ; the outer visible rocks may be passed at a distance of 2 or 3 cables. Beacons. \u2014 There is a yellow stone beacon on MSislotten, at the western entrance to Hammersund; and a similar beacon, 15 feet high, stands on an islet at the eastern entrance to the sound, about S.E. f S. 2\\ miles from Solv\u00e6rbo. Breiflue, 2 miles northward of the rocks off VedS, Kis marked by an iron pole. Jonsskjer, a 2 fathom shoal lying S.W. \\ W. 1\\ miles from the west point of EdS, is marked by a staff and broom beacon. LIGHT. \u2014 On the small islet of Ringholm, off the north-east point of EddS, a fixed white light is exhibited from the top of a square wooden tower painted yellow, 30 feet high ; the light is elevated 44 feet, and should be visible 9 miles; it is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. Pilots may be obtained from GripS, Solv\u00e6r, and Bratv\u00e6r. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When the clearing marks for Griptaren have been distinctly made out, vessels may stand in through GriphSlen, passing from H to 2 miles northward of Grip church, and steer about S.E. \\ E. for 5 miles, or until Rensfjeld is visible over Kv\u00e6rnbierg, the eastern hill on NordlandsS ; course may then be altered to about E. by S. for 4 miles, which will lead southward of Solv\u00e6rbo ; and then E. by N. \\ N. for 10 miles, which will lead 2 or 3 cables southward of Jonsskjer to Ringholm. If there is any delay in obtaining a pilot from GripS or Solv\u00e6r, which however is unlikely, circumstances must decide whether it is better to"], [253, "235 CHAP. IX.] GRIPHOLEN TO KRISTIANSUND. proceed through the lead or seek an anchorage between Griptaren and Smolen. Reefs and sunken rocks extend to the distance of 3 to 7 miles from the west and south-west sides of SmSlen, and fully 4 miles from the outermost visible rocks off the north side. Great caution must therefore be observed when approaching this part of the coast, but even in moderate weather the sea will often break with considerable force on the edges of shoals carrying 7 or 8 fathoms, so that in a stiff breeze vessels may pass safely wherever there are no breakers. A vessel will be northward of Griptaren as long as Carlsholm bears south ward of E. by S. ; and Grip church kept between the bearings of S.S.E. and S.S.W. leads eastward of Griptaren and westward of the dangers off Smolen. CAUTION. \u2014 It is ofthe greatest consequence to avoid being carried northward of the Grip islets by the current, not only on account of Griptaren, but because it is difficult to obtain a pilot, owing to the scanty population of the islands. The great distance a pilot boat would have to proceed in order to reach a vessel outside the reefs, and the heavy swell which generally prevails, must also be taken into consideration. There is no anchorage between Grip islands and Bratv\u00e6r. Griphdlen to Kristiansund. \u2014 Having entered GriphSlen according to the previous directions, vessels bound for Kristiansund may haul to the southward as soon as Stavn\u00e6s lighthouse bears S.W. 1 S., which will lead eastward of Hilbaaren reef ; and proceed for the entrance to SSrsund. If bound through the eastern entrance, bring Kvitn\u00e6s light to bear about South, and steer for it ; give Golmodde and Haaskjer a good berth, and when the sound is well open, proceed through it for the harbour ; the western part of this channel is extremely narrow, and if there is no pilot on board strangers are recommended to take the SSrsund entrance, which is little more than one mile farther from GriphSlen. At night. \u2014 As it might possibly be necessary to proceed from GriphSlen to Kristiansund after nightfall, it should be observed that Stavn\u00e6s light bearing S.W. \\ S., or Kvitn\u00e6s fight bearing S. \\ E., will lead eastward of Hilbaaren ; and that a vessel will be clear of Golmodde and Haaskjer as long as she keeps within the white sector of Kvitn\u00e6s light. It may also be mentioned that Ringholm light bearing E.N.E. lead south ward of Jonsskjer. Anchorage. \u2014 IQ nne weather vessels of moderate size might anchor to wait wind or tide between GripS and GrSnningen, in 12 to 18 fathoms, over a clear sandy bottom. Mooring rings will be found on the rocks ; and there is no difficulty in leaving. There is also a small anchorage west ward of a rock lying E. by N. | N. about 6 cables from Gripo. GrSn ningen bearing S.W. by W. will lead between the rocks at the entrance."], [254, "236 ROMSDALS ISLANDS TO SMOLEN. [chap. ix. SolV36r. \u2014 There is a small harbour on the east side of Solv\u00e6r, between Lille Solv\u00e6r and Plakken, with a depth of 8 to 6 fathoms, over sand and clay ; it is little more than one cable broad. Solv\u00e6r may be easilyr recognised, as it is so far southward of the other islets off SmSlen ; the principal island of the group is rather lofty, and is distinguished by a small beacon. After passing Haaskjerene, which are steep-to, the houses in a small cove at Solv\u00e6r will be seen ; and when Lille Solv\u00e6r bears N. | W. a vessel may proceed for the anchorage, passing between the beacons on Lille Solv\u00e6r and Plakken. The anchor should be dropped in the middle of the harbour, and hawsers must be run out immediately to the rings on shore. Grundeflue is marked by a staff and broom. ARNEO BANK. \u2014 About 5 miles eastward of Solv\u00e6r, between Breiflue and Jonsskjers, there is a bank about a mile in diameter on which vessels may anchor in 6 to 9 fathoms, over a good sandy bottom. This may be considered a very fair roadstead except during strong southerly winds, which send in a heavy sea. On the south-east part of the bank there are only 5 fathoms. Arned. \u2014 On the north side of ArneS, about 1-^ miles north-westward of ArneS bank, there is a good and secure harbour, about 3 cables broad, with from 6 to 7 fathoms over a clear bottom. This is better than the anchorage at Solv\u00e6r Tor outward bound vessels meeting with contrary winds, especially if it is blowing fresh ; but it is not a desirable place for vessels bound through Trondhjems Lead owing to the difficulty of leaving it with southerly winds. EDDO. \u2014 Temporary anchorage will be found on the south side of EddS at a distance of half a mile to a mile from the shore, in 22 to 15 fathoms, over sand ; the best position however is 2 or 3 cables off shore with the church bearing about N.N.W., in 9 to 7 fathoms over clay. This roadstead may be left easily with easterly or westerly winds. Tyrhaug. \u2014 Between Ringholm and Tyrhaug, at the north-east end of EdS, there is a good harbour for inward or outward bound vessels ; it has a depth of 5 to 6 fathoms over fine white sand, but the berth to be taken up must depend upon the size of the vessel. Ringholmflue is marked by a staff and broom. KALFLUE. \u2014 If it is not blowing too hard, a vessel may anchor on Kalflue, a bank 2 or 3 cables in diameter, which lies E.N.E. three-quarters of a mile from Ringholm. The best anchorage is in 7 to 8 fathoms ; there are 12 to 13 fathoms on the southern part ofthe bank, and only 5 fathoms on the north side ; the bottom is sandy throughout. Should it come on to blow hard, it would be advisable to shift berth to Tyrhaug or Otterholm. There is a red buoy on Kalflue. Otterholm. \u2014 At Otterholm there is anchorage in a sound between"], [255, "237 CHAP. IX.] SOLV\u00c6R \u2014 INNER FIORDS. two islets in 5 to 8 fathoms, clean bottom ; but it is narrow, and unfit for vessels bound towards Trondhjem. Ringholm. \u2014 Eastward of Kristiansund the first anchorage on the south side of the entrance to Trondhjems Lead is between Ringholm and Tustern, 1| miles eastward of MSislotten. The entrance is somewhat narrow and intricate, but the harbour is good though small, and has a depth of 8 to 9 fathoms. It is used principally by outward bound vessels, but also by those unable to reach Kristiansund owing to a shift of wind. Stangdragd. \u2014 Small vessels of light draught may pass through Hammersund to the roadstead at StangdragS, about 1J miles eastward of Ringholm, but the channel is narrow. Larger vessels might enter from the northward, but they should not attempt it if outward bound. The anchorage has a depth of 8 to 9 fathoms. There is a rock in Hammersund marked by an iron pole. Stord. \u2014 In the small sound between StorS and Solskjero, about 2i miles S.S.E. of the western extreme of EdS, there is anchorage for inward or outward bound vessels in 10 to 8 fathoms, over a soft bottom. INNER FIORDS.\u2014 Eastward of Stemshesten, which forms the western boundary of the NordmSre district, the country is intersected by numerous fiords, which between the large islands AverSen, FredS, Tustern, Stabben, and ErtvaagS, penetrate upwards of 30 miles inland in various directions. As these fiords are not yet laid down on the charts with sufficient accuracy for navigable purposes only a brief description of the principal channels will be given here. Bremsn\u00e6s-fiord with its continuations Kvalvaag, Thingvolds, and Sundals fiords, extends to SundalsSren, about 20 miles to the southward and eastward of Rensfjeld. Near Bremsn\u00e6s church is the Bremsn\u00e6shule, probably the largest cave in Norway, it is 40 feet wide, nearly 280 feet high, and penetrates Bremshatten for a distance of 280 feet. Sundals river which takes its rise in the Dovre fjeld some miles southward of Sneh\u00e6tten, flows into the head of Sundals fiord. Eastward of Mangilbierg is the entrance to Halsfiord. which is separated from Thingvolds fiord by a peninsula 25 miles long and from 2 to 4 miles broad. Besides Stangvik and Surendals fiords, Hals fiord has several minor branches, and in its general form somewhat resembles a bird's claw. The main channel of the NordmSre fiords extends southward of Tustern, Stabben, aud ErtvaagS, in an almost direct E. f S. direction, 30 miles from the east side of NordlandsS to VinjeSren at the head ofthe Vinje fiord, its average breadth is about 1^ miles. Although these fiords are less frequented by yachts than those of many other districts, they possess great attractions and are well worth a visit. Pilots for the inner fiords may be obtained at Kristiansund."], [256, "238 CHAPTER X. SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD). Variation in 1880. Smolen - - 16\u00b0 50' W. Froien - - 16\u00b0 10' W. Fro Havet- - 16\u00b0 10' W. Trondhjem- -14\u00b020'W. CHARTS. \u2014 The charts for that part of the coast eastward of 8\u00b0 E. longitude which is included between the parallels of 63\u00b0 and 64\u00b0 12' N., or in other words from the entrance to Trondhjems Lead to Alminding islands (off the entrance to Brand fiord), are incomplete as to details, and though sufficiently correct for ordinary practical purposes must be used with caution. The outer dangers off the south and west coasts of SmSlen, as far north as lat. 63\u00b0 30', were correctly laid down in 1873. It is therefore unadvisable to enter any of the smaller channels and anchorages on this part of the coast without a pilot ; but with care and attention to the following directions there would be little difficulty in taking a well found vessel to Trondhjem. ArneS bank roadstead, and the anchorages off EddS, as well as Oreland bay and Trondhjem bay, might safely be used by strangers. TRONDHJEMS LEAD.*\u2014 Having in the last chapter described the various entrances to Trondhjems Lead, it seems desirable to follow that important channel as far as Trondhjem before returning to the outer coast. Trondhjems Lead is that great channel leading southward of SmSlen, Hitteren, and the Lexen islands, and through part of Trondhjem fiord to the city of Trondhjem ; its general direction is easterly for a distance of 70 miles from GriphSlen, but at Agdeu\u00e6s it bends abruptly to the south ward for a distance of 10 miles, turning eastward again at Stadsbygden, a small village 10 miles westward of Trondhjem. With daylight and a fair wind Trondhjems Lead cannot be considered a difficult passage, even for strangers ; but as the channel is narrowed by a number of small islets towards the east end of Hitteren, it is not easy for large vessels to work through. Of the various entrances from seaward, GriphSlen is, perhaps. the one most frequently used. LIGHTS. \u2014 There are four lighthouses in Trondhjems Lead, viz.. Ringholm, Terningen, Agden\u00e6s, and Munkholm ; each of these exhibits a fixed white light from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Norway, sheet V., Smolen to Sve fiord, No. 2,307."], [257, "CHAP. X.] 239 TRONDHJEMS LEAD. Ringholm light (page 234) is elevated 44 feet, and visible 9 miles. Terningen light, on the north side of the channel, 26 miles east ward of EdS, is elevated 93 feet, and should be visible 9 miles between the bearings of East through north and west to W. by S. AgdenSBS light, 20 miles eastward of Terningen, is elevated 109 feet, and visible from a distance of 8 miles. Munkholm light, elevated 38 feet, is visible 8 miles from the bearing of S. by E. | E. through east and north to S.W. 1 S. BSrSholm light (page 254) though visible from part of the Trondhjems Lead, is chiefly intended for the guidance of vessels entering from FrS Havet. DANGERS and BEACONS.\u2014 Trondhjems Lead is singularly free from invisible dangers, and the few that exist are well marked. Grdnflue, a sunken rock lying S.E. by S. half a mile from Romengen, and N.E. f E. 3\u00a3 miles from Ringholm, is marked by a staff and broom. Friskjer. \u2014 A white stone beacon has been erected on Frisk j er, the northernmost ofthe Grisevaag (Grusvag) rocks, off GierdS. Skibn\u00e6s-galten, on the western extreme of a shoal extending three quarters of a mile off the west side of Dromn\u00e6s, is marked by an iron pillar ; and there is a staff and broom on Skibn\u00e6sflue, about three-quarters of a mile W. by S. from Skibn\u00e6s-galten. Teistholm (MarkusS), about N.E. by E. 3^ miles; from Dromn\u00e6s, is distinguished by a stone beacon. Olvigsten, nearly 4 miles westward of Terningen, is marked 'by an iron pole. Tranholm, a small islet nearly 3 miles eastward of Terningen, marks the north side of the channel between AunS and Ystholm, and will be recognised by its black stone beacon. Storflue and Stortaren lie between VedS and South Lexen ; the former is marked by three staff and broom beacons, and the latter by an hon pole. Smerlingflue, about three-quarters of a mile south-westward of Smerling or Sm\u00e6ling, is marked by an iron pole. Agden\u00e6sflue and Agden\u00e6s-kj\u00e6rringen, off Agden\u00e6s, are respectively marked by a buoy and an iron pole. Frdsetskjer and Saxvikskjer, in Trondhjem fiord, are marked by iron pillars ; Frosetskjer lies about a mile westward of the anchorage at Flak."], [258, "240 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. MUNKHOLM,* formerly known as Nidarholm, a rocky islet about three-quarters of a cable in diameter, lies 9 cables northward of Trondhjem, with the point on the west side of the entrance to Trondhjem bay bearing W. by S. \\ S. distant 9\\ cables, and Hladehammer, the point on the east side, bearing S.E. by E. f E. also 9^ cables distant. On this islet are the remains of one of the oldest monasteries in the north of Europe ; it was fortified in 1658, and has been used as a place of confinement for state prisoners. Considerable sums have been expended on the defences. Lying as it does in the middle of the entrance to Trondhjem bay, Munkholm, with its fort and lighthouse, is a most useful mark for the anchorage. Dangers Off Munkholm.\u2014 A shoal carrying from one to 5 fathoms extends N.E. by N. nearly 7 cables from the north side of Munkholm, and on this shoal, near the north-east side of the islet, there are three rocks which uncover. On the western part of the shoal a broom beacon bas been placed in 3^ fathoms, N. by E. 2J cables from the north point of the islet ; and N.E. by N. 6^ cables from the same point, is a broom beacon in 9 feet of water. The outermost of the three rocks, which dries at half ebb, lies N.E. | E. If cables from the north point of Munkholm ; the middle rock is always visible ; and the inner rock is just covered at high water. A dangerous ledge, carrying from one to 3 fathoms, extends nearly li cables south-east from Munkholm. Clearing marks. \u2014 The Fort flag-staff at the west end of the town of Trondhjem bearing S. by W. leads 1^ cables westward of the dangers off Munkholm, and the same object bearing S.W. by S. \\ S.will lead east ward. \u2022 No satisfactory marks can be given for clearing the north extreme of the shoal, therefore it will not be prudent to approach the north-east side of the islet nearer than one mile. At night. \u2014 Munkholm light is obscured in the direction of the outer part of the shoal, therefore a vessel will be safe as long as the light is visible eastward of S. by E. or westward of S.W., and is more than 5 cables distant ; when within about 6 cables of* the light,\"course should be altered to pass at least 2 cables westward or eastward of the islet. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Having passed about 3 cables southward of Ringholm and the red buoy on Kalflue, the course is E. by N. \\ N. 11 miles to the south point of Hitteren; and then E. \\ S. 13 miles to Krokn\u00e6s. From half a mile northward of Krokn\u00e6s, the course leading southward of Terningen, Tranholm, and the islets off BSrS Sund, and northward of HemskialS, Ystholm and Svansholm is E. by N. 9 miles to * See plan : \u2014 Trondhjem bay on Admiralty chart,No. 2,295, scale \u00bbi = 6 inches."], [259, "CHAP. X.] TRONDHJEMS LEAD. 241 South Lexen, and then E. N. 3 miles to FiskerS, off the east point of North Lexen, Having passed 3 or 4 cables southward and eastward of FiskerS a vessel may follow the land on the south side of the channel at a distance of half a mile off shore, until Sm\u00e6ling bears N.W., when the course is again E. \\ N. about 5 miles to Agden\u00e6s, on the west side of the entrance to Trondhjem fiord. After rounding Agden\u00e6s, at a distance of 4 or 5 cables, the course is about S. \\ E. 10 miles through the first reach of Trondhjem fiord, which is nowhere less than \\\\ miles broad, and is perfectly clear. When the church at Stadsbygden bears N.E. distant 2 miles, the course changes to E. by S. i S. for 8 miles, when Munkholm will bear S.E. J E. distant about 3 miles. If without a pilot, strangers are recommended to pass 4 or 5 cables westward of Munkholm, and steer about S. by E. i E. until within 2 or 3 cables of the west end of the breakwater at Trondhjem, when the anchor may be let go in from 15 to 20 fathoms, and a shore hawser run out astern to one of the mooring dolphins. It should be added that the set of the tides may necessitate some slight alteration in the above courses, but as a rule a vessel will be safe as long as she gives all visible islets and rocks on either side of the fairway a moderate berth. The narrowest part of the passage is between the islets southward ofthe east end of Hitteren, and when about 1^ miles westward of Sm\u00e6ling, care must be taken to keep within half a mile of the land to the southward to avoid Smerlingflue. At night. \u2014 No satisfactory directions can be given for the navigation of Trondhjems Lead on dark nights, strangers must therefore use their own discretion as to the advisability of anchoring till daylight or proceed ing under the direction of a pilot. Anchorage. \u2014With the exception perhaps of the roadstead at Havn, none of the anchorages between EddS and Oreland bay could accommodate more than one large vessel ; and, as a rule, strangers ought not to use them without the advice of a pilot, as they are only roughly delineated on the chart. Indre V\u00e6rd. \u2014 On the west side of Indre V\u00e6rS, about 9 miles E.N.E. from Ringholm lighthouse, there is a good small harbour with 8 to 10 fathoms, sandy bottom ; it might be used by vessels bound either east ward or westward.

Skibnsesd. \u2014 IQ the bay on north side of Skibn\u00e6sS there is good anchorage in from 14 to 3 fathoms, suitable for inward or outward bound vessels. The winds which occasion any swell, tend to drive a vessel up the bank, and when the wind is off the land, shore hawsers may be laid K 740.

Toftd. \u2014 About 4 miles eastward of Dromn\u00e6s is the islet ToftS, on the east side of which inward bound vessels might bring up in 7 to 8 fathoms ; but as the anchorage is indifferent it is seldom used. Aunhammeren and MarkuSO. \u2014 On the north side of the Lead there is a good small harbour for outward bound vessels between MarkusS and Aunhammeren point with 9 to 10 fathoms, muddy bottom. The entrance is close to the west side of the point. About a mile farther west there is another small anchorage close within MarkusS. Magerd. \u2014 At MagerS, between RSstS and Krokn\u00e6s, is one of the best and most spacious harbours in this part of the Lead ; it is suitable for vessels bound either way, and might admit of two large vessels mooring. Havn. \u2014 A little eastward of Havn farm, about 2 miles westward of Terningen, is a roadstead where vessels may lie at single anchor in fine weather, at a distance of 2 or 3 cables from the shore ; but as there is a swell with southerly winds, and some difficulty in getting under weigh with the wind at south-east, it is not recommended for outward bound vessels. The bank, which consists of clay, is of considerable extent, and carries 9 to 7 fathoms. Havnskjer, which lies about 2 cables off the point on the west side of the anchorage, is marked by an iron pole. Stora Havn, which is formed by the small islets eastward of Terningen, has a depth of 12 to 13 fathoms, but the holding ground is rocky and untrustworthy. There is also a considerable swell with south westerly winds, and it is difficult to get away with all winds from the southward ; this anchorage, therefore, should not be resorted to except in case of necessity, and is unfit for large vessels. Ingeborgviktaren and Lyngotaren in Stora Sund, and Skarvskjertaren at the entrance to the harbour, are marked by staff and broom beacons. Dybsund and Aund Havn. \u2014 Dybsund, between GiSstenS and Auno, has a depth of 14 to 16 fathoms, but can only be left with northerly winds. There is also anchorage for small craft between AunS and Tranholm, and on the north side of AunS. A sunken rock in AunS Havn, and a rock north of GrSnholm, are marked by iron poles. Vedd Havn and Bdrd Sund are frequently used by coasters, but a pilot is necessary to point out the southern entrances. Kraaktaren and Skj\u00e6ltaren in VedS Havn, Skifttaren between Vedo and Hitteren, Grindvikskjer south of Hestviken, and BSrStaren in BSrS Sund, are marked by iron poles. BSrSflue has a staff and broom on it."], [261, "CHAP. X.] TOFTO \u2014 ORELAND. 243 Hemskiald. \u2014 On the north-east side of HemskialS, one mile S.S.W. from Tranholm, there is good anchorage in 10 to 12 fathoms ; it cannot, however, be left with easterly winds, and is therefore only useful to inward bound vessels. There is room here for one large vessel. Syd (South) Lexen. \u2014 The harbour on the south side of South Lexen, which has a depth of 6 to 7 fathoms over sand and clay, is one of the best in Trondhjems Lead for either inward or outward bound vessels of moderate size, and is therefore much resorted to. One large vessel might be berthed here. Vessels bound to Trondhjem sometimes use this anchorage when coming up the Lead with a stiff southerly gale, which would prevent their laying up through the reach southward of Agdeu\u00e6s. Nord (North) Lexen and Fiskerd. \u2014 If unable to stem the tide, inward bound vessels might bring up off the south end of North Lexen in 10 to 8 fathoms, sandy bottom, or among the Fisker islets to the eastward of North Lexen in 6 fathoms, but these anchorages should only be used in fine weather. KongSVOlden. \u2014 At Kongsvolden, S.W. by S. one mile from south FiskerS, there is a good harbour with room for one large vessel ; it is available for vessels bound either way, but there would be some difficulty in beating out against a north-easterly wind. StaVO. \u2014 On the south-west side of StavS there is good anchorage in 16 to 14 fathoms opposite the outer mooring ring, and iu 10 to 8 fathoms opposite the inner ring, over good holding ground, it is, however, only suitable for outward bound vessels of moderate size. Garten. \u2014 Inward bound vessels might anchor during a calm off the south side of Garten island in 10 to 12 fathoms over white sand. Fladn88S. \u2014 About a mile eastward of Fladn\u00e6s one large vessel might anchor at a distance of one or 2 cables from the shore. This anchorage may be left with any wind, but the soundings are deep and irregular, and the bank very steep. The remainder of the bay, between Fladn\u00e6s and Horholm point is rocky and uneven, the soundings varying from 7 fathoms close to the rocks to 20 and 30 fathoms at a boat's length off, and then no bottom at 30 fathoms.* Oreland. \u2014 The peninsula of Oreland, of which Fladn\u00e6s forms the south-western extreme, is remarkably flat, and projects far into the sea. In some parts of the boggy ground, anchors and chain cables have been found in a good state of preservation, and the skeleton of a whale was discovered some years since in the valley of Terning about 50 feet above the sea level, showing that the plain must at some time have been covered by the sea. There are numerous barrows on Oreland, and at the upper * Remarks by Staff-Commander E. H. Hills, H.M.S. Agincourt, 1873. Q 2"], [262, "244 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) .

On the mountain Borgklinten, to the north-east of Osteraat, there are some pre historic intrenchments of a remarkable character. ORELAND BUGT Or BAY,* on the south side of Oreland is an anchorage of considerable extent, the bottom muddy, and good holding ground everywhere outside a depth of 9 fathoms ; between that depth and 5 fathoms it is generally hard clay, and inside of that stony, with patches of sand and rock. The water shoals from 7 fathoms to 5 and 3 fathoms rather abruptly in all parts. The best anchorage is in from 10 to 16 fathoms, with the wooden pier bearing about W.N.W., and caution should be observed in approaching the eastern side of the bay, as the rock off Osteraat point, if covered, rarely breaks. There are no streams of good water in this bay. Vestvikflue is marked by an iron pole. Osteraat bay, eastward of Osteraat point, affords anchorage for two or three large vessels, but in deep water, and close to the shore, the holding ground is good, but the bank of soundings is veiy steep. Skj\u00e6gholmsflue is marked by an iron pillar. Skidren fiord. \u2014 In SkiSren fiord there is anchorage between the Eidsholms, about 2 miles eastward of Osteraat bay in 7 to 8 fathoms over sand and clay ; and at Hatlevig, 1\u00a3 miles farther eastward, there are 9 to 10 fathoms. At the eastern end of the fiord, in Nord fiord or North creek, there is a tolerably well sheltered harbour with a depth of 14 to 16 fathoms, but probably only an accident would cause a vessel to run so far in, and it is difficult to get out again. Feevaag, on the south side of SkiSren fiord, one mile eastward of Brettingsn\u00e6s, is a very fair roadstead for outward bound vessels ; it can be left with all easterly winds, and in that respect is more convenient than Oreland bay, especially in the autumn. The depth is from 12 to 14 fathoms, and the anchorage is tolerably well sheltered. AgdenaBS. \u2014 Near the sunken rocks off Agden\u00e6s, a vessel might bring up in 7 to 9 fathoms to avoid drifting during a calm. S\u00e6lven. \u2014 At S\u00e6lven, 1 miles southward of Agden\u00e6s, there is a snug cove for inward bound vessels of moderate size, with a depth of 8 to 10 fathoms.j See plan: \u2014 Oreland bay on Admiralty chart, No. 2,295, scale m = 8 inches. f S\u00e6lven bay might admit of one large ship mooring if the place were more closely examined. \u2014 Remarks by Staff-Commander E.

X.] ORELAND \u2014 TRONDHJEM. 245 Aaramon. \u2014 Two miles southward of S\u00e6lven, opposite Aaramon farm, there is a bank at a short distance from the shore, where an anchor might be dropped during a calm in 9 to 10 fathoms over sand and clay, but it would be necessary to run out a shore hawser. Temporary anchorage might also be found close to the shore on the north side of the entrance to S\u00e6ter bay, on the east side of the channel, a little southward of Aaramon. Ydre (Outer) Lensvig and Lensvig Havn are two creeks about 4 miles southward of Aaramon. In Outer Lensvig vessels of moderate size might anchor in 10 fathoms if outward bound, and in 6 fathoms if bound inwards ; the bottom consists of clay.* Lensvig Havn is not a good anchorage. Rddberg. \u2014 Eastward of RSdberg point, which should be given a good berth, there is a good roadstead for vessels bound either way. The best anchorage is in 5 to 7 fathoms, with Stadbygden church bearing about N.N.W. A vessel should not approach the land within the depth of 5 fathoms, or let go in more than 10 fathoms, as the bank is steep.f Flak.- \u2014 There is fair anchorage in 6 to 12 fathoms between Froset skjer and Flak ; the least water is towards the eastern rock ; and there is a passage between the southern Flak rock and the mainland. TRONDHJEM. t\u2014 The city of Trondhjem, or Nidaros as it was termed until the fifteenth century, owes its origin to King Olaf TrygvesSn, a.d. 996, although more properly Saint Olaf must be considered the actual founder. It was formerly the royal residence and seat of govern ment, and remained the capital of Norway until 1380. According to an article of the constitution of 1814, the coronation of the Norwegian sovereigns must be solemnized in Trondhjem cathedral. As capital of the Stift, Trondhjem is the residence of the Stift-amtmand and the Bishop ; and as third in point of population, the coronation city of the Nor wegian kings, the seat of the Royal Scientific Society and the Bank of Norway, and also as the scene of many striking historical episodes it is one of the most important places in the country. The city is beautifully situated at the head of a bay on the south side of Trondhjem fiord. The river Nid, by making a wide sweep to the * Outer Lensvig has room for one large ship to anchor in 20 fatlioms, with the church in line with the centre of a clump of wooden huts, bearing W.N.W. ; that position would be just within the edge of soundings, and with 80 fathoms of cable the ship would tail into 5 fathoms. \u2014 Remarks by Staff-Commander E.

The streets are wide and regular, with large square water cisterns at the intersections, and though most of the houses are of wood, and without architectural pretensions, yet with their red roofs, and windows filled with flowering plants, they have a pleasant air of cleanliness and comfort. Destructive fires have hitherto been of frequent occurrence. Besides the cathedral (Domkirke) and the church of our Lady (Frue Kirke), which are of special interest, the principal buildings are the Bakland and Hospital churches. Stiftsgaarden, in Munkegaden, is a large wooden house which was fitted up as a residence for the king, and is occupied by the Stiftsamtmand. Among the principal institutions may be mentioned a hospital, infirmary for lepers, lunatic asylum, asylums for the deaf and dumb, and several im portant private charities. There are several schools, a museum and public library, an exchange, two private banks, a theatre, and various clubs and artistic societies. Close to the cathedral, on the south side of the town, are the remains of the old Kongsgaard or Royal Palace, which, with the adjoining grounds, has been turned into an arsenal and dockyard. The naval depot is well kept, and contains a considerable number of gun-boats, each in its own shed, with all stores numbered and ready for instant service. Trondhjem is steadily progressing in wealth and commercial importance, trade being facilitated by railway communication with Kristiania and the Gulf of Bothnia. The principal industrial establishments are a dockyard ; a foundry connected with a boiler and engine factory ; mechanical work shops ; a building yard for iron vessels, employing 300 hands ; steam saw mill, distillery, tannery, ribbon factory, ropewalks, tobacco works, &c. The vessels built at Trondhjem have the reputation of being very fast and very wet. The imports are wines, groceries, and other articles for home con sumption. The principal exports are copper from RSraas ; dried and salted fish, chiefly salmon, cod, ling, and herrings ; oil, timber, tar, &c. In 1876 the value of the imports was 716,666/., and that of the exports 222,222/. ; the Customs receipts amounting to 100,444/. Vessels clearing inwards in 1876 registered 61,900 tons, and those clearing outwards 43,800 tons. In the same year upwards of 100 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 10,600 tons, belonged to the port ; the sailing vessels representing 6,600 tons, and the steam vessels 4,000 tons.

Supplies. \u2014 All kinds of supplies may be obtained at Trondhjem ; and vessels in want of repairs can be accommodated. An English vice-consul is resident. Pilots. \u2014 If bound to the northward through the Inner Lead, com manders should endeavour to obtain the services of \" general coast pilots \" before leaving Trondhjem, as the Government passed pilots are not allowed to take vessels beyond Namsen fiord.

Springs rise 8 or 9 feet. TRONDHJEM BAY is exposed to the north and north-west, and properly speaking has no good harbour, except for vessels of about 12 feet draught ; it is therefore not a good wintering place for large vessels, unless they can be sufficiently lightened to enable them to enter the river. The bay forms almost a semicircle, the shores receding 7 or 8 cables from a line joining the projecting rocky points on either side of the entrance, which bear from each other E. A S. and W. N. distant 1| miles. At the head of the bay, somewhat on the east side, is the slightly projecting peninsula on which the town stands. The whole of the eastern side of the bay is shoal to a distance of from 2 to 6 cables off shore, but the roadstead is capable of accommodating a large fleet. The general depth is from ] 5 to 30 fathoms, but increases rapidly beyond a distance of 3 or 4 cables from the shore, when westward of a line joining Munkholm and the fort flagstaff at the west end of the town. The holding ground is everywhere good.* The harbour of Trondhjem is upwards of 3 cables in length from the mouth of the river Nid to the bridge ; the width at the entrance is barely half a cable, and decreases gradually to about 70 yards, the least water being 10 to 11 feet. A channel from the mouth of the river to the bay, is marked by piles and has dolphins on both sides for warping. The entrance to this channel is marked by two triangular beacons, one at the end of each pile breakwater ; the western beacon is surmounted by a ball. About N. by W. W., one cable from the entrance, a warping buoy is moored in 16 fathoms. The width of the entrance between the beacons is a little over half a cable ; thence the channel runs S. by]E. E. for 2 cables, and curves gradually for about 2\\ cables more to the mouth of the river, which takes a S.W. f W. direction to the bridge. * Trondhjem bay is much more extensive than was supposed, though the shoal off the breakwater extends some distance, and there is a dangerous ledge extending lj cables south-east from Munkholm. The general depth is from 15 to 30 fathoms, but the holding ground is everywhere good. On the occasion of the coronation of His Majesty King Oscar II., there were assembled 15 vessels of war \u2014 ironclads, frigates, and corvettes in the bay, and double that number might have been berthed. \u2014 Remarks by Staff- Commander E. H. Hills, H.M.S. Agincourt, 1873."], [266, "248 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. The deepest water in the outer channel, and also within the river, is on the east side, shoal ground extending from the western piles nearly half way across the passage. The depth on this shoal is only 5 feet at the eastern edge, dropping suddenly into 9 and 12 feet, and close to the eastern piles there is a depth of 16 feet. Off the entrance, between the warping buoy and western beacon, there are 9 and 10 feet, deepening to 14 feet between the outer piles. Inside the river the depth is from 10 to 16 feet. The edge, of shoal water off the west side of the harbour entrance extends in a W.S.W. direction 4 cables from the western triangle beacon ; it then bends south-westward for 2 cables towards the western end of the stone breakwater, and from thence runs nearly parallel to the land along the west side of the bay, at a distance of 1 J cables from the shore : the depth on the outer edge is 7 to 12 feet. The east side of the bay is shoal within a line from the eastern pile breakwater to Hladehammer point. The stone breakwater, which has a bathing house and flagstaff on the western part, is about half a cable from the northern frontage of the town ; it is 4^ cables in length, forming an elbow to the northward, and encloses a small harbour with a depth of 2 to 3 feet at low water springs : at the east end of this harbour there is a boat passage close to the north-east point of the town, and two openings will be left at the west end by the small detached breakwater which is in course of construction. At the west end of the town a wooden pier runs out one cable in a N.N.E. direction ; on the east side of this pier is a small boat harbour ; and on both sides are dolphins to which shore hawsers may be secured. A warping buoy is moored in 24 fathoms, N. by E. E. one cable from the end of this pier. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The best anchorage for large vessels is between one and 2 cables from the dolphins en either side of the wooden pier at the west end of the town, in from 15 to 30 fathoms. Vessels using this an chorage generally let go one anchor, and moor with hawsers to the dolphins to guard against being blown off the bank, which is steep to the northward. There is also anchorage between the shoals off the mouth of the river, and the ledge off the south-east side of Munkholm, in from 10 to 20 fathoms. Large vessels may either moor with their own anchors or with shore hawsers secured to the rings in the rocks below the castle. Entrances. \u2014 The various entrances to Trondhjem from seaward are enumerated in the last chapter, see page 227. Climate and country. \u2014 In summer the climate of Trondhjem is very uncertain, the transitions from heat to .cold being sudden and unex pected. In winter the temperature is less variable ; and the sky is generally clear. At YtterS, an island 25 miles north-eastward of Trondhjem, the"], [267, "249 CHAP. X.] TRONDHJEM \u2014 LEV ANGER. mean annual temperature, at an elevation of 250 feet above the sea level, is 41\u00b0 F., the highest temperature registered up to 1872 was 82\u00b0 F., and the lowest was 0\u00b0 F. ; the mean daily temperature being below freezing point 123 days in the year. Trondhjem bay never freezes. South Trondhjem's Amt is rich in historical reminiscences and arch\u00e6o logical remains ; and the remarkable series of well-defined terraces, or natural levels, which extend for a considerable distance along the course of the river Nid, are of special geological interest. Though the oak has all but ceased to grow, and few kinds of fruit come to any degree of per fection, the aspect of the country is cheerful, habitable, and flourishing. Some of the valleys are highly cultivated and extremely fertile. The ra pidity of vegetable growth is sometimes extraordinary ; on more than one occasion two crops of barley have been reaped in the same year, while it is not uncommon for barley to be reaped six weeks after it is sown. The scenery of Trondhjem fiord is varied and picturesque, resembling in character the coast scenery of Argyll and Inverness shires. The hills, though not densely wooded, are by no means bare, the birch in particular flourishing wherever the mountain slopes are sheltered from direct sea winds ; and the shores of the fiord are dotted with picturesque villas and country houses, belonging to the wealthy families of the town. TRONDHJEM FIORD, with its continuations, extends about 45 miles north-eastward from Trondhjem, but though of some importance, the inner parts of the fiord are only charted on a small scale. This fiord affords in reality by far the readiest communication with the sea for all the northern parts of Sweden, as well as Norway, being only 26 miles from the Swedish frontier, and 180 miles from Sundsvall on the Gulf of Bothnia ; it is never frozen, and is consequently navigable all the year round. The southern or eastern shore of the fiord is very irregular, and forms several large bays and peninsulas ; the northern or western shore trends generally in a north-easterly direction, with but few indentations. Pilots for the inner part of Trondhjem fiord maybe obtained at Trond hjem. LEVANGER, a small trading town with a population of 1,000, is built on the south side of V\u00e6rdals fiord, 32 miles from Trondhjem, and 8 miles from the south point of YtterS. The houses are good and clean, but the streets are unpaved and very dirty. The harbour of Levanger is the most sheltered of all the inlets on the eastern shore of Trondhjem fiord ; it is consequently much resorted to by fishino- vessels, and forms a sort of commercial outport for the trade of Trondhjem. As soon as the snow renders the transport of heavy goods practicable on sledges, the Swedes come across the fjeld to Levanger in great numbers,"], [268, "250 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. principally from Jamtland ; and two large fairs are held every year, one in December, the other in March. The situation ofthe place is considered so important for commercial purposes that several of the mercantile houses of Trondhjem have branch establishments there. Dangers. \u2014 Off the peninsula of Frosten are the following rocks : \u2014 Vestvikflue, marked by an iron pole ; Holmbergsflue and Aarsholmflue, marked by iron pillars. Fiordskjeret, a rock lying E. by S. S. 2| miles from the eastern extreme of YtterS, and the same distance N.E. by N. from the entrance to Levanger, is also marked by an iron pillar. Directions. \u2014 From one mile north-east of Munkholm, the course is N.E. for 10 miles, or until Frosten church bears S.E. by S. ; and then changes to E.N.E. for 12 miles to YtterS fiord, on the south-east side of YtterS. From one mile south-westward of YtterS, the course is E. | N. 8 miles to the point on the west side of the entrance to Levanger. If bound direct to Levanger from Trondhjems Lead, proceed as directed (see page 240,) until Stadsbygden church bears N.E. distant 2 miles ; then steer E. \\ S. for 6 miles, when Flak rock will bear about S.S.W. \\ W. and Munkholm will bear S.E. \u00a3 E. distant 5\\ miles. From this position steer E.N.E. for 25 miles, edging to the eastward, if necessary, to give Omborn\u00e6s a good berth, and haul to the eastward for Levanger as soon as YtterS fiord is well open. V\u00e6rdalsdren. \u2014 About 5 miles eastward of Levanger, at the mouth of V\u00e6rdal river, is the village of V\u00e6rdalsSren, whence a road leads 2\\ miles eastward to Stiklestad, celebrated as the spot where Saint Olaf was killed in battle, A.D. 1030. Beitstad fiord, the inner branch of Trondhjem fiord, is about 15 miles long E. by N. and W. by S., and from 3 to 5 mUes broad : it is almost an inland lake, the only entrance being through the narrow channel Skarnsund, on the west side of Indero peninsula. The southern entrance to Skarnsund is 2 miles northward of YtterS. Stenkj\u00e6r, at the eastern extreme of Beitstad fiord, has 1,300 in habitants, who are for the most part employed in the timber trade. The town is built at the mouth of By river, which forms the outlet of the Snaasen Vand. Snaasen Vand is a beautiful lake 64 feet above the level of the sea ; it is about 20 miles long E.N.E. and W.S.W., and from one quarter of a mile to 2 miles broad ; the western extreme is 5 or 6 miles northward of Stenkj\u00e6r. When bound direct to Stenkj\u00e6r, proceed as directed for Levanger until south-eastward of Slipra point, continuing through Nordviksund and Skarnsund to Beitstad fiord. From Levanger, vessels may pass eastward of YtterS, and through InderS fiord to Skarnsund."], [269, "251 CHAP. X.] TRONDHJEM FIORD. Country. \u2014 Towards the inner part of Trondhjem fiord the country is less rugged than in the immediate neighbourhood of the city ; the soil is superior, and cultivation is no longer confined to the hollows, but spreads in all directions. Luxuriant crops are produced, and the successful culti vation of the hop (Humidus lupulus) in this district is well worthy of notice ; it is singular that a plant which is so delicate and precarious in the south of England, and generally requires expensive culture, should flourish here, in latitude 64\u00b0, though but little attention is paid to it. The scenery is very beautiful, V\u00e6rdal especially, with its fine river and nume rous farms, being one of the most flourishing valleys in Norway. These little farms, with their substantial, comfortable looking houses, are the estates of peasant proprietors, an interesting class peculiar to Norway. SMOLEN TO BRAND FIORD. Between Kristiansund and the entrance to Trondhjem fiord, are the three large islands SmSlen, Hitteren, and FrSjen. SmSlen, as already observed, is very low by comparison with the other islands and the main land; Hitteren and FrSien are rocky and high, but not mountainous. Hitteren is nearly 25 miles long east and west, and from 7 to 9 miles broad north and south; SmSlen and FrSien are much smaller. Between SmSlen and the west point of FrSien, are the entrances to RamsS and FrSi fiords. Small islets, surrounded by rocks above and below water, extend nearly 1 5 miles north-westward from FrSien, and from the north point of that island a scattered range of islets and rocks, terminatino in the Halten cluster, stretches about N.E. J E. nearly 30 miles ; these are known as the FrS islands. Between this range and the mainland, whieh runs in an almost parallel direction from Oreland peninsula to Brand fiord, is the great open space named FrS Havet (the FrS sea). ASPECT. \u2014 When standing in towards the opening between Smolen and FrSien from the northward and westward, Kopperen, Fonna, Stabben, and Tustern mountains will be visible in clear weather at a great distance. If the vessel is northward of SmSlen, the mountains on Stabben and Tus tern islands will be visible separately; but if westward of SmSlen they will be shut in together, Tustern overtopping the group. If the mountains appear detached, and there is low land with outlying islets ahead, it must be SmSlen ; the high land on Hitteren will then be seen to the eastward, but KopperQn will be hidden by the hills of FrSien. DANGERS. \u2014 The outer dangers off the north side of SmSlen are Ystklakken, Svartfluen, Melklakken, Flaksboen, Storboen, and Giessino-bo. Oreklakken or Skoen is the westernmost of all the dangers northward of FrSien."], [270, "252 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. Ystklakken, Svartfluen, Melklakken, and Flaksboen, are sunken rocks lying from 4| to 5\u00a3 miles north-westward and northward from Bratv\u00e6r, the sea breaks on them even in calm weather. A vessel might pass close to these rocks if necessary, but no good leading marks can be given. Skolmen, a lofty, narrow, isolated rock, lying N.N.W. 1 W. 1^ miles from Bratv\u00e6r church; and Flisa rock, which is also detached aud lies N.E. |- E. 3 miles from Skolmen and 4 miles N.N.E. of Bratv\u00e6r. are useful objects for cross bearings. Reef. \u2014 Between Flaksboen (which lies N. | E. 4| miles from Skol men) and Storboen, a rock lying N.E. | E. 2 miles from Flisa and N.N.W. | W. 3^ miles from Veien islets, is a dangerous reef extending nearly 4 miles E. by S. S. and W. by N. | N. ; its position is generally indicated by breakers, but as it lies nearly 8 miles northward of SmSlen great caution must be observed when approaching the land in thick weather. The summit of Indre Veiholm, visible eastward of the house on Veien, or these islets bearing South, will lead eastward of the reef between Flaksboen and Storboen. Giessingbo is a reef about half a mile in diameter, the southern part, on which there are several rocks above water, bears N.E. by E.|E,4 miles from Hopen church on the north side of SmSlen, and N.N.W. 3 miles from Kvitholm, a steep, lofty, and perfectly white islet, on the west side of the entrance to RamsS fiord. Kvitholm, bearing S. \\ E., leads eastward of Giessingbo. Oreklakken or Skoen, a reef about a mile long N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. \\ W., and half a mile broad, carries a depth of 9 to 16 fathoms, but breaks in rough weather ; the south extreme bears N. \\ W. 6-^ miles from the outer islet off Titteren, the west point of FrSien. Taaningen, the highest hill on the north-west part of Hitteren, open westward of the islets off Titteren, leads westward. Pilots may be obtained from Bratv\u00e6r, Kv\u00e6rnv\u00e6r, and Titteren Tides. \u2014 It is high water full and change at Titteren at lOh. 58m. Springs rise 6 to 7 feet. RAMSO FIORD, the western of the northern entrances to Trondhjems Lead, leads in from seaward between SmSlen and Hitteren ; it is about 7 miles long in a north and south direction, and from one to 2 miles broad between the numerous islets on either side of the fairway. S vartskj erflue lies W. by S. \\ S. 8 cables from the west point of SebueS, and N.E. \\ N. 1^ miles from the east side of Kvitholm. On the western side of the channel, 1^ miles westward of Svartskjerflue, is a sunken rock which lies N. J E. 8 cables from the west point of Kvitholm. The centre of Kvitholm bearing S.S.W. \\ W. leads about half-way between these rocks."], [271, "253 CHAP. X.] RAMSO FIORD \u2014 FROI FIORD. Midtfiordbo is a dangerous rock lying nearly in mid-channel at the north end of the fiord, E. by S. J S. 8 cables from the south point of Kvitholm, and a rock lies 2\\ cables from the north-east side of the same islet. Ramsdboen, about S.W. by S., 1\\ miles from RamsS, at the south end of the fiord, is marked by an iron pillar. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 When entering RamsS fiord between the dangers off SmSlen and FrSien the land must be approached with great caution, close attention being paid to the bearings of any landmarks that are in sight, until Veien or the low point of Titteren can be distinguished. The north side of Titteren or Titterodden bearing E. 1 S. will lead northward of the reef between Flaksboen and Storboen, and Veien bearing South will lead eastward. Taaningen, or Fonna mountain, kept open westward of Titteren bearing about S.S.E. will lead westward of all the dangers off the north side of FrSien. A vessel may approach the islets off Veien or Titteren to within a mile in order to pick up a pilot. To enter RamsS fiord from a position 4^ miles northward of Kvitholm, with the northern islets off Veien bearing W. \\ N. and Hopen church bearing S.W. i W., a vessel should steer S. by E. \\ E. for 5 miles ; this will lead westward of Svartskjerflue to the islets eastward of Midtfiordbo. Give these islets a berth of 2 or 3 cables ; and when the south point of Kvitholm bears W.N.W., steer as necessary to pass half a mile westward of the islets on the east side of the fiord, proceeding eastward of RamsSboen to Trondhjems Lead. Anchorage. \u2014 There is a passage between Melklakken and Flaksboen to Bratv\u00e6r, where there is a small harbour with a depth of 7 to 8 fathoms, sandy bottom. The north-east point of Skolmen bearing S. \\ E. will lead between Melklakken and Flaksboen ; but strangers should not attempt to enter the harbour without a pilot. Southward of Indre Veiholm, there is anchorage at a place named Skindstakholm, in 10 to 4 fathoms, good holding ground ; vessels may lie here at single anchor or with a kedge, but they can only leave with westerly winds. There is a fair roadstead, with a depth of 6 to 7 fathoms, between Katholm and FlanS, southward of HammerS. RamsS fiord has no good harbour ; small craft might, however, put into StensS Sund ; there is also anchorage for vessels of considerable burden in a bay named GielsS Sv\u00e6t, on the east side of the fiord, but the entrance is too intricate to be attempted unless for some special reason, and then it would be advisable to obtain a pilot from SebueS. FROI FIORD, between Hitteren and FrSien, is about 15 miles long E. \\ S. and W. \\ N., and varies in breadth between the rocks on"], [272, "254 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. either side of the fairway, from 3 cables to nearly 2 miles. In the outer or western part of the fiord there is room for working, but it is very diffi cult to turn through the narrows in the eastern part of the channel on account of the strong tidal stream, which generally follows the wind. In clear weather Kopperen will be iu sight the whole way through the fiord ; it resembles a haystack in shape, but appears quite blue. Stabflue. \u2014 If necessary to approach the south side of Titteren within three-quarters of a mile, care must be taken to avoid Stabflue, which lies S.E. three-quarters of a mile from Sandholm, and the same distance W. by N. J N. from the western islet off' IlsS. Velsflue lies about 4 cables from the northern extreme of DolmS. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The foregoing directions must be attended to until the outer dangers are passed, and a pilot obtained from Titteren. Running through FrSi fiord from the westward with a sah wind, pass 1J miles southward of Titter islands, and steer E. f S. for 11 miles to the islets off the western part of DolmS. Pass 2 or 3 cables southward of the islets on the north side of the channel, and run along the north side of DolmS at the distance of not less than half a mile, taking care at the same time to keep Flisa rock, which lies nearly in mid-channel at the east end ofthe fiord, a little northward of E. by S., as there\" are several sunken rocks to the westward of it. The northern Ran islets, off the east end of DolmS, bearing E.S.E. will lead between the rocks off DolmS and Flisa ; when FrS Havet opens out, the course E. \\ S. for about 9 miles will lead to the northern entrance to Trondhjems Lead. Entering Trondhjems Lead from Fro Havet, a vessel should pass nearly one mile northward and eastward of the rocks off TJlvS and HerrS, and steer about S. f E. for 4 or 5 miles, passing west ward of Ugstenskjer, Ugstenholm, and Kraakvaag, and eastward of the small islet Flisa or Blomsterholm. When Sm\u00e6ling is in line with Agden\u00e6s, bearing about E. by S., course may be altered to pass either northward or southward of Smerlingflue to Trondhjem fiord. If bound to the westward from FrS Havet, south of Hitteren, pass east ward of Sliskjer and Sliskjertaren, which lie north-eastward of BSrSholm. Sliskjer is marked by a black stone beacon, and Sliskjertaren carries an iron pole. Storflue and Stortareu must be avoided when passing beween VedS and South Lexen, and course may be altered to about W. by S. when the channel northward of Svansholm and Ystholm is well open. LIGHT. \u2014 From the tower of a white wooden building on the east side of BSrSholm a fixed light, visible from the bearing of S. \\ W. (through west) to E.N.E., is exhibited from the 1st August to the 15th of May."], [273, "255 CHAP. X.] FROI FIORD. The light is white except between the bearings of S.W. and S.S.W., which cover Sliskjer and Sliskjertaren, where it is red; it is elevated 44 feet, and in clear weather should be seen from a distance of 9 miles. At night. \u2014 Approaching BSrSholm from the northward at night, a vessel will pass eastward of Reksfaldet or Guldholmstaren, and westward of Ugstenskjer, by keeping within the western sector of white light ; but Flisa or Blomsterholm, and Breiflue, will be nearly in mid-channel ahead. Brieflue, which carries 4 fathoms, and breaks when the sea is heavy, lies north-westward of Flisa. It is therefore advisable to open the western edge of the red light when between Fieldv\u00e6rsS and Kraakvaag, haul into the white light again, either to the eastward or westward, when within 3 miles of the lighthouse. Anchorages. \u2014 -Returning to the western entrance to FrSi fiord, the anchorages between Titteren and Trondhjems Lead will be found in the following order : \u2014 Within the Titter islands there is anchorage northward of Sandholm in 7 to 9 fathoms ; when off the entrance to the harbour, which is eastward of Sandholm, the houses can be seen. Two miles eastward of Sandholm, there is. a narrow anchorage at FladS, with a depth of 13 to 16 fathoms, and farther to the eastward, on the south-west side of IlsS, there is anchorage in 15 to 20 fathoms. Small vessels might pass through the long narrow sound between DolmS and Hitteren, in which they would find anchorage at HopsS, opposite DolmS church, and also at Hekaasen ; but the tidal streams run through the sound with great velocity. The anchorage at Hekaasen is the best in FrSi fiord ; but large vessels can only use the eastern entrance : the depth is from 5 to 14 fathoms. In case of a shift of wind vessels would find anchorage in Knalle Sund, between Fieldv\u00e6rsS and UlvS ; the holding ground is good, and the depth is from 5 to 10 fathoms throughout nearly the whole sound ; it may be entered either from the eastward or westward. Between the east point of Hitteren and BSrSholm, there is anchorage in 8 to 12 fathoms; but there is a swell with north-easterly winds, and it is not so easy of ingress or egress as Knalle Sund or South Lexen. On the south-east side of Stor Fossen there is a good roadstead which may be sought occasionally ; it is difficult to make from the northward on account of Juledagene rocks. At Vaag, on the south side of Stor Fossen, there is good anchorage for small vessels only. FROlEN to HALTEN ISLANDS.\u2014 The utmost vigilance must be exercised when approaching the coast between FrSien and the Halten islands, a space of nearly 400 square miles being covered by an"], [274, "256 SMOLEN TO ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. infinite number of small and generally low islands, interspersed with rocks and shoals. The outer rocks of this dangerous group, which forms the west side of FrS Havet, extend in places fully 38 miles from the mainland, and upwards of 5 miles from the nearest visible rocks ; on these dangers the depths range from as little as 3 feet to 10 fathoms, with very deep water immediately beyond them to seaward. Breakers will always be seen on the outer part of the reef, even when there is a considerable depth over them. The whole ofthe broken and unsafe ground is indicated on the chart; and also the principal passages by which a vessel might seek one ofthe neigh bouring anchorages or enter FrS Havet, if caught upon a lee shore: but practical seamen will at once perceive that the most perspicuous description would afford insufficient guidance through such labyrinths j the necessary information can only be given by pilots, well acquainted with this intricate navigation. The principal landmarks, and the various anchorages to which a vessel might resort in case of necessity will be described, as there is just a possibility that such information might prove useful. Pilots. \u2014 In bad weather it will be very difficult for a pilot from the FrS islands to board a vessel in the offing, and many of the islands are uninhabited. Fishermen, however, occasionally resort to even the outer most islets, and will be of great service if they can get on board. LIGHT. \u2014 On Halten island, which is situated near the south end of the cluster forming the northern termination of the FrS group, stands a white stone tower with a red lantern, from which is exhibited a flashing white light showing a flash every four seconds ; the light is elevated 124 feet, and should be visible for a distance of 18 miles in all directions in clear weather ; it is shown from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. Beacon. \u2014 A stone beacon with a flat top has been erected on Sulen island ; it is 24 feet high, is always kept white, and in clear weather should be visible at least 1 0 miles. Landmarks. \u2014 SkogsS, nearly 5 miles E.S.E. of Sulen, is higher than the neighbouring islands, and is tolerably distinguishable. Kya, 5\\ miles N.N.E. of Titteren, is very low, but there are some fisher men's huts ou it, and it lies westward of all the other islets. The centre of Oreklakken or Skoen reef lies W. by N. \\ N. 3\\ miles from Kya. Fieldrate, the outermost reef to the northward of Oreklakken, lies N.W. by W. i W. 6\\ miles from Sulen. Passages through Fro islands. \u2014 The principal passages through the FrS islands are Suls fiord (which has two entrances from seaward), the passage north of Mausund, Giesing Bogen, and Sau Sund. Of these the northern entrance to Suls fiord, Giesing Bogen, and Sau Sund are the least impracticable, but it is useless to attempt to describe them ; the best entrance from seaward to Giesing Bogen and Sau Sund is about 14 miles"], [275, "CHAP. X.] 257 FRO ISLANDS \u2014HALTEN ISLANDS. north-eastward of Sulen, 15 miles northward of FrSien, and 20 miles west ward of Halten, on the parallel of 64\u00b0 3' N. Anchorages among Frd islands. \u2014 About half a mile north ward of Sulen, and close eastward of the islets Sandhohnene, there is a bank about 2 cables in extent, with a depth of 8 to 10 fathoms, over sand and stones ; a vessel that had drifted among the rocks might bring up on this bank in an emergency. Entering from the westward, Sulen beacon should, if possible, be kept about E. by S. \u00a3 S. ; this bearing would lead between the outer dangers. There is better anchorage off the south point of Snisholm, 1^ miles south eastward of Sulen, the bank being 3 or 4 cables in diameter, with a depth of 7 to 9 fathoms. Mausund islands, 5 miles eastward of Sulen, are inhabited ; near them are three anchorages. The northern of these is on a bank named Eiflue, one mile to the northward ofthe group ; it is barely 2 cables in extent, and is exposed to a heavy swell with the wind on shore ; the depth is 8 to 12 fathoms, over sand and stones. The next anchorage is close to GaarsS, the northern most of the Mausund islands, in 10 to 12 fathoms ; shore hawsers may be laid out to the surrounding islets. Finally, anchorage may be found in 10 to 12 fathoms to the eastward of Satrumso. There is good anchorage in Sau Sund, 13 miles south-westward of Halten islands, in 8 to 9 fathoms ; it may be entered from either side. The harbour at Nordbuen, 3 miles north-eastward of Sau Sund, opens to FrS Havet ; it is almost impossible to make it from seaward on account of the surrounding rocks. The small harbour at Halten island has a depth of 8 to 10 fathoms, sandy bottom, and may be entered from the eastward or westward. The eastern entrance is between LundS and HusS. LundS is distinguished by a rough cairn or pile of stones, and HusS by a large pole, like part of a mast, and several fishermen's huts. On the rocks at the entrance to the harbour there are two iron poles. No one should attempt to enter Halten harbour without having visited it previously. DANGERS off HALTEN ISLANDS.\u2014 Udgrundflue, or Outer rocks, the northernmost of all the dangers on the west side of FrS Havet, lie N.W. \\ W. 5 miles from Halten lighthouse, and 5| miles north ward of Hors islands. The depth on the northern part of the reef, and from thence to Halten islands, is 3 fathoms ; but immediately seaward of the northern edge, and as far as East and West Breakers, there are from 60 to 100 fathoms. East and West Breakers lie N.E. by N. one mile and N. by W. H miles from the northern Halten island ; they only cover at high water, and the sea always breaks on them. K 740. It"], [276, "258 SMOLENTOALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD), [chap. x. FRO HAVET is upwards of 30 miles long in a N.E. 1 E. and S.W. \u00a3 W. direction, and about 12 miles broad. Nearly all the islands and visible rocks on the west and south sides of FrS Havet may be approached to within a mile ; but on the east side shoals extend from 4 to 5 miles off Alminding islands and V\u00e6ret, and about the same distance from the main land as far southward as Tarve islands. Twelve miles southward of the Halten islands, and 9 miles E.S.E. of Sau Sund, is a dangerous reef off Fladholm and Melsten, which is nearly 2\\ miles long E.N.E. aud W.S.W., and fully one mile broad ; shoals are said to exist between this reef and Ansten, a small holm 2\\ miles southward of Melsten ; and a rock with 4 feet on it is said to lie half-way between Ansten and Aarv\u00e6ret.* Pilots.\u2014 From the middle of May to the close of September, fishermen will generally be found on the Halten islands, who are capable of taking charge of a vessel, and conducting her, if necessary, to Trondhjem. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 To enter FrS Havet from seaward, vessels should make the Halten islands, and bring the lighthouse to bear S.E. by S. dis tant 6 or 7 miles ; an E.S.E. course for 7 or 8 miles will then lead about one mile northward of West Breakers ; but if blowing strong from the northward, it will be advisable to give them a wider berth, to allow for a probable southerly set. When the lighthouse bears westward of S.W., course may be altered to S. \\ W. for 8 miles, or until Jemsan bears N.W. distant 2 miles. A course of S.W. by S. for 26 miles will then carry the vessel to the passage between Ugstenskjer and HerrS. These courses are calculated without reference to the set ofthe tides. If obliged to work through FrS Havet without a pilot from Halten, a vessel should keep on the western side, both for safety, and because it affords the best chance of obtaining assistance. When steering for the entrance to the harbour at Halten, the eastern Svelting rock bearing S.S.W. will lead eastward of East Breakers, and may be passed at the distance of 3 or 4 cables. Tarve islands.\u2014 Besides the anchorages on the west and south sides of FrS Havet, which have already been enumerated, there are some small harbours among the Tarve islands, a group lying 4 miles north westward of Tondalfjeld. The best anchorage is off the north-east side of FaarS, at the south end of Tarve Sund, in 6 fathoms ; but the entrance is intricate, and northerly winds are required for leaving. On the north-east side of Jyltingen, the southernmost of Tarve islands, there is also a good small harbour. There are no dangers off the western side of Tarve islands, and vessels may pass close to everything visible. * Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Racoon, 1864."], [277, "CHAP. X.] FRO HAVET \u2014 INNER LEAD.1 259 Valder or Valler Sund, between ValsS and the mainland, affords safe anchorage, though the depth is from 20 to 30 fathoms. The entrance is northward of Gjessingen and ValsS, and southward of Aarv\u00e6ret and the islets off SjSrS. Northward of ValsS is the islet KvalS, which is distinguished by a stone beacon ; Svineflue, on the north side of the entrance between ValsS and KvalS, is marked by an iron pole, and a rock on the south side of the channel is marked by an iron pillar. To enter Valder Sund from FrS Havet, pass one or 2 cables north or south of Sellholm, a small islet one mile south-west of Ansten, and steer S.E. by E. for 2\\ miles. When past the north-eastern rocks off Gjessingen, a S.S.E. course for 1^ miles will lead to the entrance northwards of ValsS ; keep nearly in mid-channel between ValsS and KvalS, and proceed for the anchorage off the houses when the sound opens to the south-westward. INNER LEAD. \u2014 As that part of the Inner Lead between Beian at the entrance to SkiSren fiord and Besager Sund is not only extremely intricate, but is also very roughly delineated on the chart, no one should attempt it without a pilot.

Directions. \u2014 If bound northward through the Inner Lead from Beian, pass between Tyvholm and Sm\u00e6ling, and bring N\u00e6skirke a little within TSndalfjeld, or Fossenv\u00e6ggen in line with Kongsvoldaxlen ; these marks will lead outside Kjeungerne to Bjungskjer, the west side of which may be passed quite close. After passing westward of Fes tholm, keep Fosnistan (two round knolls westward of Stor Fossen), open westward of Kisten, the largest and westernmost of the high holms of Juledagene, until near the Valsholms, when Kraaka must be brought in line with LysSskallet. Pass eastward of Kraaka, and haul to the eastward after passing close to the west side of Naglen, keeping at first near the mainland, and continuing in mid-channel through Valdersund. On leaving Valdersund, keep nearest the land to the westward until near Koen and Kalven ; pass eastward of these islets, and bring Kalven a little eastward of Koen. When the latter marks can no longer be seen, Koen should be kept in line with LysSskallet, or the eastern cleft in Linna in line with the western cleft in StokS until the cairn on Stejlholm is in line with Svanen, a remarkable cleft in the southern part of Harebakfjeld. Proceed through Stoksund, and steer for Kraaka, taking care to avoid Galten, a small rock between Kiran and MaaS ; the east point of KjeS, in line with SkjervShakket, leads eastward of Galten ; pass eastward of Kraaka and KjeS, then steer for the west point of Terningen, and proceed in mid channel through Besager Sund. It must be obvious that these directions will be useless to strangers, and they are merely intended for a reference, which might be useful to those possessing a certain amount of local knowledge. Anchorages. \u2014 In Stoksund, some 14 miles northward of Valdersund, there is anchorage at several places. Kraakd Havn, 4 miles E.S.E. of Hvalhovden, the south extreme of AlmindingS, affords good anchorage in 5 to 6 fathoms, sandy bottom. Vessels may bring up either off the houses on the east side of KraakS,"], [279, "261 CHAP. X.] INNER LEAD. opposite the mooring rings on the point, or farther southward towards Lyngholm. Between Lyngholm and the houses there is a small patch carrying 10 or 12 feet, otherwise the ground is even. In Anstensund, northward of AlmindingS, there is safe anchorage for small craft in 7 to 8 fathoms, over sand ; the sound is only 60 fathoms wide. A vessel might also bring up for a time at Utro, northward of Roan church."], [280, "262 CHAPTER XI. ALMINDLNG ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. Variation in 1880. 14\u00b0 00' W. Alminding islands - 14\u00b0 50' W. | Leko GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 Trondhjem may be said to form a connecting link between Northern and Southern Norway, which differ very considerable in many of their characteristics ; its position too is geographically peculiar. The Scandinavian peninsula is here only 250 miles broad, from Sundsvall on the Gulf of Bothnia to the North Sea at the entrance to Trondhjems Lead, and continues of nearly uniform breadth to Lulea near the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, which is also about 250 miles from BodS on the west coast. The mountains of Northern Norway, commonly known as the KjSlen range, extend, though not in an unbroken chain, from the neighbourhood of Alten in lat. 70\u00b0, beyond which they rapidly decline in a S.S.W. direction to the parallel of Trondhjem, where they attain a height of nearly 6,000 feet at SyL fjeld, on the Swedish frontier. Here the expansion of the peninsula becomes apparent, and the mountainous surfaces spreading in proportion from those great table lands, of which the Dovre fjeld is a striking example, still however pre serving a general parallelism to the western coast, which is everywhere nearly in contact with considerable hills. That part of the peninsula north of Trondhjem which belongs to Norway is both narrow and mountainous, it contains, therefore, a small population, and includes only four Amts or provinces, North Trondhjem, Nordland, TromsS, and Finmarken, while Southern Norway contains fourteen. It is besides nearly destitute of longitudinal valleys. Its rivers run comparatively short courses, and their banks offer but few level spots fi t for cultivation, and still less accommoda tion for roads. The interstices of the hills which run from the main chain to the sea are occupied by fiords and gulfs ; and in numberless cases these hills, being wholly separated from the mainland, form groups of precipitous, often almost inaccessible islands. When to this is added the near approach to a sub-arctic climate, where winter occupies about three-fourths of the year, it will be understood that in leaving Trondhjem we enter upon a country secluded by all its physical circumstances from the rest of the world, and possessing many corresponding peculiarities."], [281, "263 CHAP. XI.] REMARKS. CHARTS. \u2014 The series of charts embracing the coast from Brand fiord round the North Cape to Jacob river, though often inaccurate as to minor details, such as the smaller harbours and more intricate channels, a correct idea of which could only be given by plans on a larger scale, are, on the whole, reliable. By their aid, alone, the whole of the Inner Lead northward of Vigten has been safely navigated, therefore, if carefully studied in conjunction with the directions, they will prove a sufficiently trustworthy guide when no pilot is available.* ALMINDING ISLANDS TO LEKO.f Between Alminding and Vigten islands, a distance of nearly 40 miles, there are comparatively few outlying dangers ; the entrances to the har bours from seaward are consequently shorter than those to the north ward, and vessels may with greater safety approach the coast in order to identify the landmarks or obtain a pilot. This part of the coast being however fully exposed to south-westerly gales is much feared by the coasters. Vigten islands, or, as they are sometimes termed Vigtenodden (Vigten point), possess hardly any harbours of refuge, and in addition to being surrounded by outlying rocks and reefs, they are rendered still more dangerous by the current, which generally sets right into the bays north ward and southward of the group. These islands form the commencement of that vast fringe of islands, rocks, and shoals which stretches along the coast as far as the entrance to Vest fiord, and sometimes extends fully 30 nules from the mainland ; this fringe is termed in Norway the \" skjergaard,\" a term which will be used hereafter as being the most com prehensive. Southward of the Vigtens are the extensive fiords Folden and Namsen, which are annually visited by numerous vessels in connexion with the berring fishery and timber trade. These fiords are deep, and with few exceptions free from dangers ; they have also several good harbours. Pilots are stationed at Oxbaasheia, Villa, BiSrS-v\u00e6r, Namsos, Gieslingen/ N\u00e6rSsund, Vigten, and LekS. Tides. \u2014 The flood stream sets to the north-east during fine weather, and the ebb to the south-west ; but in general the north-east going stream is the stronger, especially at the distance of 20 or 30 miles from the land. In continued stormy weather, with the wind from about south or west, the tidal tream runs strongly and constantly to the north-east; and with northerly or easterly gales to the south-west ; but not so strongly as in the * Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N f See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Norway, sheet vi, Brand Fiord to Leko, No. 2,308."], [282, "ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap, xi 264 former case. Within the islands the flood stream always sets to the north east, and the ebb to the south-west ; but here also the north-east going stream is the stronger. It is high water, full and change, at Villa at llh. 20m. ; extraordinary springs rise 8 feet ; ordinary tides range 5 or 6 feet. COAST. \u2014 From Beian, at the entrance to SkiSren fiord, the coast trends in a north-east direction for upwards of 300 miles to the inner end of Vest fiord. Northward of Beian, the appearance of smooth and rounded rocks is universal ; this continues more or less for about 100 miles northward of Trondhjem. Aspect Of COast. \u2014 When approaching the coast 6 or 8 miles north ward of the Halten islands, land will be seen, in clear weather, as far south ward as TSndalfjeld, and from thence northward to Oxbaasheia. About 2 miles eastward of TSndalfjeld are the Lille and Stor Kopperen mountains ; Stor Kopperen looks like a haystack, and may be seen from a distance of 30 or 40 miles. On the island Linna or Lin\u00e6sp, about 15 miles northward of Kopperen are Lin\u00e6sfjeld and Stemma, and in the steep cleft between these hills is a small round knoll or hummock named Stemma Kalve. AlmindingS, which has a smoothly rounded peak in the middle, presents the same appearance when seen from the westward or northward ; it is visible at a distance of 12 to 15 miles. Close to [the northward of Almin dingS is a group of low islands named V\u00e6ret, upon which there are three knolls, Anstenkollen, Ekkerhovden, and Maashauen, which serve as marks for the shoals to the westward. On Troningsfjeld, a little southward of KraakS, a white road stretches obliquely up the mountain ; it can be seen 10 or 12 miles beyond AlmindingS, and is a useful mark for Ranen shoal or the entrance to the Kaura Lead. Vig Skielen, 10 miles E.N.E. from AlmindingS, is high, and stands out distinctly from the land to the north ward ; SkjervS is much lower, and from the westward looks like a sugar loaf. About half way between SkjervS and the white road on Troningsfjeld is the entrance to Brand fiord, which looks like a cutting between the hills on either side. If farther to the northward, between SkjervS and Oxbaasheia, HepsS, RamsS, and the two RSd islands will be distinguished ; they are all tolerably high, but RamsS is the largest and most conspicuous, and is visible 12 to 16 miles : the RSd islands will appear to be connected.* Ranen and Borklakken shoals, upon which the sea breaks when there is any swell, although the least depth on them is from 6 to 7 fathoms, lie 4 and 5 miles north-west and north from the north point of Almin dingS. * See View I. on Admiralty chart, No. 2,308."], [283, "chap, xi.] 265 COAST \u2014 BESAGER SUND. The mark for passing west of Ranen is the small black islet Flisa, 4 miles south-westward of AlmindingS, in line with the opening between Lin\u00e6sfjeld and StokS. Flisa in line with Lin\u00e6sfjeld, bearing S. by W., leads on the shoal. , Kaura Lead, the channel northward of Borklakkeu and Kaura, the northernmost of the small islets off AlmindingS, is the first passage northward of the Halten islands by which a vessel may enter the Inner Lead, or seek an anchorage. Fishermen from AlmindingS, who are capable of piloting a vessel, will generally be found near Ranen and Borklakken. The white road on Troningsfjeld in line with Maashauen, the northern most of the three humps on V\u00e6ret, will lead close northward of Borklakken. Wheu AlmindiugS bears westward of South, steer about S.E. \u00a3 S. until near Kaura, pass northward of that islet at a distance of one or 2 cables, and proceed either for KraakS harbour or Besager Sund. Kraakd Havn. \u2014 To make KraakS Havn from Kaura Lead, steer about S. 5 E. for 2 miles from Kaura, pass close northward and eastward of KieS, taking care to avoid the rocks southward of UtrS, and proceed between Kraaka, a small black islet marked by a stone beacon, and Brand peninsula. It will be necessary to keep close in to the latter when nearing the north end of KraakS to avoid KraakStaren, a small rock awash at low water. The north end of Kraaka in line with Hvalhovden leads north ward of KraakStaren, and the same point in line with the south end of Kraaka leads southward of that rock. A vessel will be eastward of KraakS when UtrS is shut in by the north-west point of Brand peninsula, and may then proceed in mid-channel for the anchorage. Small vessels might enter or leave KraakS Havn by the south passage, but in doing so must avoid Stangn\u00e6sgrund, off the inner side of Veimandskjer. Besager Sund. \u2014 To enter Besager Sund, pass northward of Kaura as directed above, and steer for the north side of Lang point, until the western extreme of Terningen (a long narrow island at the entrance to Brand fiord), is in line with Besager fjeld ; keeping this mark on, and passing close to Terningen, open Besager Sund, and proceed through it in mid-channel. The anchor may be let go either opposite the mooring rings on the largest of the small islets eastward of BSrS, in 7 to 8 fathoms over sand, or between these islets and BSrS in 10 to 11 fathoms. On the south side of the sound, opposite the houses at Besager, there is a depth of 7 to 8 fathoms over sand, and more shelter from northerly winds. Farther in to the eastward, between LSa holm and the houses at Vig, there is a spacious and secure harbour with a depth of 12 fathoms over sand, but it is difficult to leave with south-westerly winds."], [284, "266 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. In Bukkel Sund, temporary anchorage might be found between the north west point of the small islet Fiskerholm and SandS, in 8 to 9 fathoms over sand ; but the bank is very steep to the northward. From Besager Sund, vessels may proceed either northward or southward through the Inner Lead. Klepholm Lead, northward of Lille Tarren, Klepholm, and FladS, also leads to Besager Sund, but the passage is very narrow, and owing to the similarity of the low islets and rocks on either side, should only be attempted with the aid of a pilot. There is anchorage in Grisvaag, on the south side of the southern SkjervS, in 5 to 6 fathoms over sand and clay.- ENTRANCE NORTH Of JUPFALLA.\u2014 The next en- trance to the Inner Lead is northward of Bremflisa and Jupfalla. Beacon. \u2014 On the small islet Buholm, about E. by N. nearly 5 miles from Bremflisa, is a conspicuous yellow stone pyramidal beacon. LIGHT. \u2014 From the 1st of August to the 15th of May a fixed white light, elevated 266 feet, is exhibited from a small wooden building on the highest point of North RSdS. The light is visible 11 miles between the bearings of E. by S. f S. and S.E. | E. also over Svee fiord, when bearing from S.W. 1 W. through west to N.W. by N. ; and through the channel southward of RSdS between the bearings of North and N.N.E. Directions and anchorage. \u2014 Synflissa, the southernmost black rock off the Buholms, in line with the north point of Oxbaasheia, will lead northward of Jupfalla. When Bremflisa, which will be easily recog nised, bears S.W. by S. distant about one mile, steer for the north point of RSdS, which may be passed at a distance of 2 or 3 cables, and haul to the southward for the anchorage at Vingsand, where there are 6 to 7 fathoms over sand ; southward of the harbour there are two small stone beacons which can be seen from RSdS. About \\\\ miles southward of Vingsand there is anchorage off RamsS, and between that island and the mainland there are 10 to 12 fathoms, sandy bottom. From RamsS vessels may pass southward of FinmarksstSiten, a rock marked by an iron pillar lying southward of HepsSholm, to the Inner Lead northward of Droxholm. At night. \u2014 The western sector of RSdS light leads between Jupfalla and Synflisa, but one mile west of the latter rock is Bargrund shoal, which carries 7 or 8 fathoms, and breaks in bad weather ; when standing in vessels should therefore keep near the southern limit of the light, and afterwards bring it a little on the starboard bow until past the point. After passing along the north and east sides of RSdS, where there are no dangers, a vessel may enter Vingsands Havn by steering South on the eastern limit"], [285, "267 CHAP. XI.] KLEPHOLM LEAD \u2014 KYA. of the light through the inner channel, and bring up in 11 to 12 fathoms, or farther in. The western limit of the light will lead eastward of Shokle island to the anchorage off RamsS. KYA. \u2014 When approaching the land 20 or 30 miles northward of Halten, it will be easy to recognise Kya, a small perfectly isolated holm about 8 miles north-westward of Oxbaasheia ; in clear weather it can be seen at a distance of 12 miles. A shoal lies about 3 cables northward and westward from Kya, but the south and east sides are clean close to. Sveskallen, Lille Houen, aud Ostvigklakken, three shoals carrying 11, 10, and 8 fathoms respectively, lie between 4^ and 7\\ miles north-eastward of Kya ; when the sea is very heavy it breaks on all three, in moderate weather a vessel may pass over them. Kya bearing S. by W. leads westward of these shoals ; Villa lighthouse bearing E. \\ S. leads southward ; and the same object bearing S.E. by E. leads northward. Aspect Of Coast from Kya. \u2014 Having approached Kya in clear weather, land will be visible extending from Stor Kopperen and TSndalfjeld to Heilhornet, a mountain 20 miles eastward of the Inner Vigtens. From this position the Alminding islands, Anstenkollen and Skj\u00e6rvS, may be distinguished. Vig Skielen is high, projecting, and smoothly rounded. HepsS, RamsS, and the RSd islands stand out distinctly from the main land ; RamsS is the highest, and has a small rounded peak on the north side of the summit. At the inner end of Vinge fiord, on the south side of Halvig Kieipen, is the remarkable mountain Vingefjeld, in which there is a deep clift, and on the south side of the clift a large round knoll. Halvig Kieipen may be known by the opening on either side. Oxbaasheia is the nearest land east of Kya ; jit is high, stands out distinctly, and the outline of the southern slope is very irregular : on the southern part of Oxbaasheia, at the north side of the entrance to Svee fiord, are two prominent knolls named S\u00e6terklumperne. HalmS is somewhat higher than Villa, and may be known by its steep slope towards the sea. Villa is something in shape like a haycock or sugarloaf, and is distinguished by its lighthouse, a hexagonal stone building 17 feet high. About 7 miles E.S.E. of Villa is a rather high hill known as Bolvigsula, which has two knolls on the summit; these appear more distinctly separate from each other when seen from the northward. BiSrS is not easily distinguished from the mainland at a distance. A few small islets of the Vigten group may be seen, but with the exception of Heilhornet there is no noticeable landmark northward of Villa.* When approaching the land a little southward of the Vigtens, numerous islands belonging to that group will be seen to the north-eastward. * See Views II. and III, on Admiralty chart, No. 2,308."], [286, "268 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. NortS and SSrS will be the most distinct, the western part of the latter is rounded and rather high. Heilhornet will be the first part of the main land that is seen, it is a steep isolated mountain rising to a pyramidal peak 3,600 feet above the level of the sea, and is twice the height of the surrounding country ; in clear weather this important landmark can be seen at a distance of 50 or 60 miles. The first noticeable objects south ward of Heilhornet are Tviberg and Apeltua which stand well out from the land behind them ; Apeltua is especially conspicuous, it resembles a broad sugarloaf or tower, and is separated from Hundhammer by a deep valley. Southward of Apeltua the hills on GiSen, and Findangerfjeld on OtterS, show distinctly against the mainland in the background. On the northern part of OtterS there are also two remarkable sugar-loaf hills close together, named Aglekviga ; and when nearer the land a similar but smaller hill will be seen to the northward of them. Close to Findanger fjeld, but on the opposite side of Namsen fiord, is the Volfjeld, which is separated from the high land to the southward by a deep ravine. It is difficult to distinguish BiSrS from the mainland beyond the distance of 10 or 12 miles ; Kv\u00e6nS, Villa, and HalmS are steep, and show out more distinctly. Sitterhugget is an abrupt vertical cleft in the mainland north ward of Bolvigsula, whose two knolls are readily recognised, the northern most being pointed, while the other is rounder and flatter ; Morkahatten is also a conspicuous peak, but when seen from the southward the three latter marks become merged and indistinct. Land may be seen southward of Oxbaasheia as far as Lin\u00e6sfjeld.* ENTRANCES from KYA.\u2014 Having made the land in the vicinity of Kya, a vessel may either steer for the entrance north of Jupfalla, or for Ellingraasa northward of Villa, whence a pilot will come off if the weather permits. There is also a passage leading in between Buholm and Oxbaasheia to RSdS, but strangers ought not to attempt it without a pilot. LIGHT. \u2014 From Villa lighthouse a fixed white light varied by a flash every fourth minute, is exhibited from the 1st of August to the 15th of May. The light is elevated 124 feet, and in clear weather should be visible from a distance of 18 miles. Ellingraasa. \u2014 The entrance to Ellingraasa (Ellingsund), the sound between BiSrS and Ellingen, is between the shoals Lille Tarren and Leira grund, which carry 6 and 9 fathoms respectively, and only break in veiy rough weather. There are two stone beacons on Ellingen. I\u00a3 obliged to enter without a pilot, bring the beacon on the highest point of BiSrS to bear about E.S.E., and steer for it on that bearing until * See Views IV. and V. on Admiralty chart, No. 2,308."], [287, "CHAP. XI.] KYA \u2014 KLAKKEN. 269 Villa lighthouse bears S.W. by W., when course may be altered to pass 2 or 3 cables southward of Elliugen. .lensoholm, a little .round islet with a small stone beacon between JensS and BiSrS, in line with the western steep slope of Findanger fjeld bearing E. \u00a7 N., will lead between the rocks off Havshohn and the south point of Ellingen. A vessel should keep on the north side of the sound when proceeding to or from the anchorage. The western anchorage in Ellingraasa is between Lille Ellingen and Stor holm in 12 to 14 fathoms over sand and clay, but the bank is rather steep to the eastward. Between Storholm and JensS there are 6 fathoms over level ground consisting of sand and clay. Between JensS and SS1S there are 5 fathoms over sand and clay ; this is the best anchorage for small craft and vessels of moderate size, but as a sunken rock marked by an iron pole lies in the middle of the southern entrance, it is necessary to keep close to JensS when entering or leaving. Halmdraasa. \u2014 If there is so much northing in the wind that a vessel cannot fetch the anchorages in Ellingraasa, she may bear up for HalmSraasa, eastward of Villa and HalmS. Entering HalmSraasa, keep in mid-channel between Lyngv\u00e6ret and Svartoxen, the northernmost small black holm off Villa ; give Borflisa a wide berth to clear the rocks which extend from it nearly half way to Skaarflisa ; and after passing northward of the latter rock and Flaaflisa, and between HalmS and Kv\u00e6nS, steer for the uorth-east point of DragS. \u00c6ggelSsa, a rock off the north point of GlasS, is marked by a black stone beacon, and a rock to the westward by an iron pole with cage. Keep close in to DragS when passing these rocks, and proceed for the anchorage eastward of the houses. There are 6 fathoms close to the east side of DragS, and 8 to 10 fathoms in the middle of the sound, over sand and clay. The northern anchorage in HalmSraasa is in the bay on the west side of Kv\u00e6nS, in 6 to 7 fathoms, but it is not a safe place with the wind at north west. About one cable westward of HalmS church there are 12 to 14 fathoms over sand and clay ; and there is also anchorage off the east point of AspS. KLAKKEN. \u2014 When approaching Villa and BiSrS from the north westward, care must be taken to avoid Klakken, the south-westernmost shoal off the Vigtens ; it carries 7 to 16 fathoms, and lies 2\\ miles westward of Nylandsskjer, the southernmost rock above water. Apeltua, open south ward of Nylandsskjer, leads southward of Klakken. Between Bidrd-v\u00e6r and Gj\u00e6sling islands.\u2014 The various inlets and anchorages between BiSrS-v\u00e6r (BiSrS cluster) and the Gjesling"], [288, "270 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. islands will be found in the following order. N\u00e6rS Sund is described under the Inner Lead (page 276). RcBkdSUnd, between BiSrS-v\u00e6r and R\u00e6kS, leads to the anchorages on the east side of BiSrS, and is the next inlet northward of Ellingraasa. The channel between BiSrS-v\u00e6r and Sydhund, a rock above water 2| miles N.N.E. of R\u00e6kS, is perfectly clear. To enter R\u00e6kSsund after passing Klakken, steer for the opening north ward of BiSrS-v\u00e6r, open the sound westward of R\u00e6kS, and proceed through it in mid-channel ; then steer for the houses on BiSrS, and having passed eastward of these, bring up about 3 cables southward of the warehouse, in 5 to 6 fathoms over sand and clay. From this anchorage a vessel may put to sea through the passage south eastward of BiSrS, but the channel is narrowed by numerous rocks, which a pilot only will know how to avoid. Lindogalten and KalvostSiten are marked by iron poles. NAMSEN FIORD.\u2014 If bound into Namsen fiord from the south ward or westward, pass between BiSrS-v\u00e6r and Sydhund, steering easterly towards Findanger fjeld till the entrance to the fiord is well open. After passing Voltaren, a rock marked by an iron pole off the point on the west side of the entrance, there is nothing to fear throughout the fiord except what is visible above water. Anchorage. \u2014 A vessel might bring up to wait wind or tide at Sand moen, on the south side of Namsen fiord 3 miles from the entrance ; but the first good anchorage is in the sound between the Leangs holms, about 3 miles southward of Sandmoen, in 10 to 12 fathoms, sand and clay. There is a stopping place at Statland ; and in Hjertvigsund, anchorage may be found at Saltn\u00e6s and opposite the warehouses at Morkan. Small craft may bring up in the cove on the east side of HaadS ; and there is temporary anchorage at Sund, westward of SkjerpS, and also between Gaasungen and the western Gaas island. At HSvig there is a good small harbour with a depth of 8 fathoms over sand and clay ; but the north side of the cove is bordered by shoal ground. Near the mouth of Namsen river, which flows into Namsen fiord a little eastward of Namsos, there is anchorage between Kvholm and the main land ; also in Pr\u00e6stvig, Storvig, and the bight to the eastward ; and in Anfindvig, on the west side of Namsos, but the inner part of the latter harbour is shoal. The Namsen is too rapid to be navigable, but timber is floated down. \u2022NamSOS, a small trading town with a population of 1,300, has a building yard at which are constructed vessels of 200 tons burden ; the harbour is chiefly frequented by vessels loading with timber and plank from the steam saw mills."], [289, "271 CHAP. XI.] NAMSEN FIORD \u2014 GTLTE FIORD. Water and provisions may be obtained at Namsos, and an English Vice-Consul is resident. Lyngen Fiord extends about 8 miles in a south-westerly direction from Namsen fiord. Aasn\u00e6s, a village at the south end of the fiord, is less than 15 miles from the northern extreme of Trondhjem fiord, with which it is connected by road. There are some glass works at Aasn\u00e6s. Vessels may pass between SkjerpS and the rock on the western edge of the extensive shoal which almost blocks the entrance to Lyngen fiord, to the anchorages in Baugsund, Altvig, and F\u00e6vig. Rddsund and Gylte fiords.\u2014 RSdsund fiord, between OtterS and Gioen, is connected with Namsen fiord by LSvS fiord, SSrvig Sund and Lokgarden ; and with Folden fiord by the Seierstad and Gylte fiords. From Gylte fiord, between Gioen and the mainland, vessels may also pass through Nordsund, eastward of ElvenS, to Lokgarden and Namsen fiord Nearly all these channels are narrow and tortuous, and a strong current runs through them, generally to the northward ; they are, however, for the most part free from dangers. Stokgrund, about a mile north-westward of OtterS, breaks constantly, and is marked by an iron pole. Taarnfald, off the western islet on the north side of GiSen, nearly always breaks. Vessels may pass on either side of Stokgrund, and proceed into RSdsund fiord as soon as the entrance is well open. Anchorage may be found in Saltbuvigen, on the east side of OtterS ; and in the bay at StrSmmen, on the west side of ElvenS ; a shoal spit runs off the point on the south side of the entrance to StrSmmen bay at least one cable. SSrvig, a small cove at the south end of SSrvig Sund, is a good harbour for small craft ; the depth is 5 to 8 fathoms, over sand and clay, and there are mooring rings northward of the houses. On the east side of tLokgarden, there is temporary anchorage at Halsos and Katmark. To enter Gylte fiord, vessels may either pass through Brakstad Sund, between GiSen and the islets to the northward, or between Taarnfald and Flottra rock, and steer easterly till the entrance to the fiord is well open. Shoals extend about 2 cables from the points northward and southward of Fosn\u00e6svig, otherwise the channel is clear. There is good anchorage in the cove at Brakstad, on the south side of Brakstad Sund, in 4 to 6 fathoms, sand and clay. Small craft may bring up in the bights between Tingstad and Botne, on the east side of Gylte fiord ; and on the east side of Nordsund, about a mile from the north entrance, there is good anchorage in the cove at Brisselien, in 8 to 10 fathoms over sand and clay."], [290, "272 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. Folden fiord. \u2014 The whole of the open space eastward of Villa and Klakken, and southward of the islets off the Vigtens, is named Folden or Folden fiord by the fishermen and pilots, but the entrance to Folden fiord proper is between Taarnfald and the islets westward of Apelv\u00e6r. Inner Folden fiord extends about 15 miles in an E.N.E. direction from Kvisten fiord ; it then bends to the southward and runs about S.E. by-E. for nearly 13 miles; the channel is very narrow throughout. Southward of Heilhornet, Inner Folden fiord is only separated from the southern branch of Bindals fiord by a neck of land about one mile broad. The only dangers in Folden fiord, eastward of Stokgrund, Flottra, and Taarnfald, are Salsn\u00e6staren, about 6 cables E.N.E. from Ryn\u00e6s ; Mefald taren, marked by an iron pole, If miles eastward of Falderaa ; Lille Taren and Stor Taren, about 3 and 4 cables south-eastward of Oxning ; and Kjetaren, 3 cables from the west side of Kjeholm, at the entrance to Kvisten fiord. Besides the anchorage at Brakstad there is a small harbour at Apelv\u00e6r, on the north side of the entrance to Folden fiord, but a pilot is necessary to point out the entrances, which are very narrow and difficult to make out. Synstholm and ApelvarS are each distinguished by a stone beacon with a pole and red cage. At Smedn\u00e6s, 5 miles eastward of the entrance to Gylte fiord, there is anchorage in 4 to 5 fathoms over clay and sand, off the houses on the south-east side of the point. There is also a small harbour, with a depth of 4 fathoms over sand and clay, between Hatholm and Purkholm, about N.N.W. 3 miles from Smedn\u00e6s ; the entrance is eastward of Hatholm and southward of Fladholm and Purkholm. On the south side of Kvisten fiord there is anchorage eastward of the houses on the north-east point of BueS. When entering Kvisten fiord, vessels should pass about one cable westward of Kjeholm to avoid Kjetaren and the rocks off Oxning. GJ\u00c6SLING ISLANDS\u2014 Amongst the South Gj\u00e6sling islands, or, as they are commonly termed by the pilots, Sor Gj\u00e6slingerne, a group lying about 7 miles southward of Outer Vigten, there are two places where a large vessel might anchor ; and small craft or vessels of moderate size might bring up in most of the sounds between the islets and rocks forming the cluster, in 3 to 4 fathoms. LIGHT. \u2014 On HaraldsS Kraaka, a rock lying E. by S. \u00a3 S. 2 miles from Kv\u00e6rnholm, stands a white stone tower, which exhibits a fixed light showing white from seaward when bearing between E. by N. \\ N. and"], [291, "CHAP.

The light, elevated 66 feet, should be visible 11 miles, and is shown from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. Beacon. \u2014 On Kv\u00e6rnholm, an islet at the south entrance to Sor Gj\u00e6shngerne, is a red stone beacon surmounted by a cross. Directions. \u2014 Entering Folden fiord from seaward, keep Apeltua open southward of Nylandsskjer till Kv\u00e6rnholm beacon bears E.N.E., which will lead southward of Bredgrundfald to DSrbrak ; a pilot will be sure to come off here, and there is nothing to fear to the southward. To enter the harbour pass between DSrbrak and Storfald, which always breaks; proceed between Kv\u00e6rnholm and Fladskjer, and eastward of Nonholm, and bring up south-westward of the largest Gj\u00e6sling island in 7 to 8 fathoms, over sand and clay : the same depth and holding ground will be found on the east side of the island, and the anchorage there is more secure. With south-easterly wiuds, when it is difficult to enter between DSrbrak and Storfald, bring Ramnaken or Gj\u00e6slingnaken, the north-western islet of the group, in line with the east point of Kv\u00e6rnholm, and steer for the latter islet with this mark on ; pass between Kv\u00e6rnholm and Little Kv\u00e6rn holm, keeping nearest the former, and proceed eastward of Nonholm to the anchorage. VIGTEN ISLANDS.\u2014 When approaching the Vigten islands from seaward there will be little difficulty in recognising them ; though not more than 500 or 600 feet above the level of the sea they are visible from a distance of 15 to 20 miles, and stand out distinctly from the mainland. On the south-west side of the Vigtens there are two passages leading through the reefs to the harbours amongst the outer islands, and on the north side of the group there is also a narrow entrance from seaward, but only the utmost necessity would justify a stranger in attempting any of these channels without a pilot. When circumstances permit, vessels should either pass southward of all the rocks off the Vigtens, and steer for one of the entrances already described ; or keep to the northward, and endeavour to make Sklinden (page 283). If unable to adopt either of these courses, the following directions may be of some service : \u2014 Hitterd. \u2014 With the exception of Klakken, HitterS is the westernmost shoal off the Vigtens ; it has 4 fathoms on the shoalest part, and breaks K 740. s"], [292, "ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD ) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. 274 with a moderate sea. Freflisa, (the northernmost of three large rocks above water about 2i miles W. by S. from NordS), shut in with the north point of that island, will lead northward of HitterS. Bugtafald, which carries 6 fathoms, lies a little south-east of HitterS. Sulafjeld, a conspicuous hill on Outer Vigten, visible eastward of NordS, leads southward of Bugtafald. The space between Hittero and NordS is occupied by rocks above and below water, which form an almost continuous reef extending nearly 4i miles E.N.E. and W.S.W. with an average breadth of one mile, so that in bad weather the sea breaks uninterruptedly throughout the whole distance. Directions. \u2014 If northward of HitterS, and obliged to stand in for the Outer Vigten harbours, steer for Freflisa on an E. by N. bearing, and pass northward of it ; an E. by N. course made good for 2\\ miles will then carry a vessel between Guldkist and MelSse up to NordS. If the weather permits, fishermen will always come off from NordS, and point out the passage to KjonsSvaag, or the sound northward of KarstenS ; in both these anchorages there are 5 to 6 fathoms over sand, but if possible it will be better to run on to Austafiord in Lang Sund. If southward of Bugtafald, steer for Bursflisa and NordSbura, and pass 2 or 3 cables southward of them ; proceed in mid-channel between Surenofald, which always breaks, and Mefiordskjer, and steer for Kors holm, where fishermen will generally come on board and take the vessel farther in. But as already observed, it is much safer to pass southward of the Vigtens altogether. Entrance north of Vigten islands. \u2014 Aarsgrund, the outer shoal north-westward of the Vigtens, carries a depth of 10 fathoms, but breaks with a heavy sea. V\u00e6rumsnubben, a conspicuous round topped mountain about 1,400 feet high, in line with Maaholm, will lead in between all the dangers off the North-west Vigtens. Fishermen may be expected to come off from FrelsS, which is inhabited ; but if no assistance can be obtained the above marks will lead clear up to Maaholm. The south side of this islet must be passed within a distance of one cable, as a shoal, which breaks in a moderate sea, lies southward of the east point. The western anchorage in this passage is between the north and south Fj\u00e6rholms and Vaholm, in 8 to 12 fathoms, sand and clay, but it is exposed to a heavy sea ; the entrance is westward of North Fj\u00e6rholm, three quarters of a mile S.E. by S. from the east point of Maaholm. From Maaholm small vessels may steer for the south point of KvalS, and bring up between that island and the islets to the southward in 6 to 8 fathoms, sand and clay. To enter this harbour a vessel must pass north ward of Tenholm, and eastward of the islet to the northward."], [293, "275 CHAP. XI.J VIGTEN ISLANDS \u2014 INNER LEAD. Large vessels must pass southward of KvalS, and northward of Mefiord boen ; V\u00e6rumsnubben kept southward of the north point of Gj\u00e6ringen, (a rather lofty island which will be easily recognised from KvalS), will lead southward of Verlan, a shoal carrying 6 fathoms, and course may be shaped for Riisv\u00e6r or TrSvik Sund according to circumstances. There are also passages between LSvS and Gj\u00e6ringen, and between the latter island and Riisv\u00e6r, but they should not be attempted without a pilot. Lang Sund, the narrow strait between the Outer and Middle Vigtens, is 12 miles long, and navigable throughout. Off Austafiord, a trading station on Outer Vigten, there is good anchorage in 8 to 10 fathoms, sand and clay. This harbour is particularly serviceable to vessels that may be driven in among the Vigten islands in winter or late in the autumn, and are obliged to seek winter quarters, not only on account of its security, but because supplies may be obtained from the merchant. Caution. \u2014 It must be borne in mind that the best advice to those approaching Vigten islands from seaward is, \" give them a wide berth.\" INNER LEAD. BESAGER SUND TO N\u00c6RO SUND\u2014 From Besager Sund the Inner Lead continues past Droxholm aud HepsS, between Bispen and Lamholm, and eastward of Buholm, whence coasters usually proceed outside the islands to N\u00e6rS Sund. The inner passages between Oxbaasheia and Folden fiord are too intricate to admit of description ; they are also extremely narrow, and are only used by fishing vessels and small coasters. Beacons. \u2014 Droxholm is marked by a stone beacon, and Droxholmsten by an iron pole. Langtaren carries an iron pillar, and Saxen an iron pole. Buholm i^ distinguished by its yellow pyramid, and there is a black stone beacon on Storkolla, northward of Oxbaasheia. Directions. \u2014 On leaving Besager Sund, steer direct for Droxholm, and pass close to it on either side ; then steer for the west point of HepsS, which must also be passed within a short distance, and proceed between Bispen and Lamholm, taking care to keep nearest, the latter; Bispen in line with the north-west point of HepsS, will then lead clear to Buholm. From Buholm, vessels may pass between the shoals off Kantraas Skjer and Grundene by keeping the west point of the largest Buholm in line with Skjervo-hakket. To pass outside these shoals, which is the safer course, give the rocks northward of Buholm a good berth, and steer northerly till the vessel is about a mile westward of Grundene ; a N.E. \u00a3 E. course made good for 16 miles, will then lead westward of s 2"], [294, "276 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO.

Anchorage. \u2014 Besides the anchorages already described, viz., Besager Sund, RamsS, and Vingsand, there is a small harbour on the west side of Oxbaasheia, named N\u00e6svaag ; it has a depth of 5 to 6 fathoms, but the enfrance is very difficult. N\u00c6RO SUND, between N\u00e6rS and Inner Vigten, is by no means a difficult passage, as the rocks off the south entrance are easily avoided ; but as the Vigten islands obstruct the direct course of the tidal streams, the water is forced through the narrow straits eastward of Inner Vigten with a velocity hardly to be stemmed by sailing vessels during the strength of the tide, even with a commanding breeze. LIGHT.\u2014 A fixed white light, elevated 39 feet, and visible 9 miles when bearing from N.E. by E. \\ E. through east and south to S.W. f W., s exhibited from Pr\u00e6stS, an islet on the east side of the south entrance to N\u00e6rS Sund, from the 1st of August to the 15th of May.

HaraldsS Kraaka light house bearing W. | S. leads southward of Grinna and Stua. Gjeitungerne. \u2014 From Gjeitungerne, a group of small holms lying nearly 2 miles W. f N. from Pr\u00e6stS, islets and rocks extend in an E.N.E. direction the whole way to Inner Vigten ; Haraldso Kraaka light, bearing W. by S. J S. southerly, will lead southward of them. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Approaching the entrance to N\u00e6rS Sund from the southward, keep HaraldsS Kraaka lighthouse between the bearings E. by N. I N. and N. by E. E. until LSkefald is passed, and do not bring Pr\u00e6stS lighthouse, to bear northward of N.E. by E. f E. until the vessel is past New rock, or until HaraldsS Kraaka bears westward of N. by W. Pr\u00e6stS lighthouse bearing N.E. by E. \\ E. will lead well westward of Stabben and Breigrundfald ; and HaraldsS Kraaka lighthouse bearing W. | S. leads southward of Grinna and Stua. When well past the latter rock, haul to the northward and proceed in mid-channel through N\u00e6rS Sund, taking care not to bring HaraldsS Kraaka to bear southward of W. by S. | S. southerly until within half a mile of Inner Vigten. No marks can be given for avoiding the dangers off Pr\u00e6stS, therefore the south-west side of that island must not be approached nearer than one mile, and the west and north sides should be given a berth of half a mile. With a fair wind the simplest plan after passing New rock is to keep Pr\u00e6stS light between the bearings N.E. by E. \\ E. and E.N.E. until within a mile of it ; then steer N. by E. \\ E. until the lighthouse bears E. \\ N., when a N.E. by E. course will lead clear through the sound. When past MarS, vessels may proceed either westward or eastward of StrSmsS, continuing between KraakS and the mainland ; SvinS may be passed on either side, and the channel then leads eastward of Gj\u00e6ringen to Riisv\u00e6r. Haverskjer, which lies nearly in mid-channel between StrSmsS and OttersSen is generally visible, and may be passed on either side. Gj\u00e6rings galten, off the south-east side of Gj\u00e6ringen, is marked by an iron pillar, and dries at half-ebb. Anchorage. \u2014 Small craft may anchor in the narrow sound on the north side of N\u00e6rS, in 3 to 7 fathoms, sand and clay ; and there is anchorage for larger vessels farther to the north-east in 10 to 15 fathoms. Vessels of moderate size may bring up in RSrvig, northward of MarS, in 6 to 8 fathoms, or in Smedvig, on the north side of MarS, in 4 to 5 fathoms, sand and clay. There are mooring rings at both these places ; and an iron pole on Smedvigbo in RSrvig may be used as a warping post."], [296, "278 ALMINDING ISLANDS (BRAND FIORD) TO LEKO. [chap. xi. The cove on the south-west side of OttersSen is a good harbour for small vessels ; it has a depth of 4 to 5 fathoms over sand and clay, bnd there is a passage on either side of the small holm in the entrance, aut close to the south point of this holm is a sunken rock. Vessels may bring up to wait wind or tide opposite the houses on the north-east side of KraakS ; but if northward bound, it is better to anchor northward of LyngS. There are also stopping places along the south-east side of SvinS ; on the east side of Gj\u00e6ringen, northward of Gj\u00e6ringsgalten beacon ; and between Maan\u00e6s and the islets to the northward. RiisVSBr.\u2014 In Riisv\u00e6rsund good temporary anchorage may be found, either off the houses or southward of LeerS, in 7 to 8 fathoms, sand and clay. In the middle of the sound there are 16 fathoms. The entrance from the southward is between BlikS and Oterholm. South-westward of Oterholm is a rock marked by an iron pillar. Blikogrund is marked by a staff and broom. RisS is distinguished by a black stone beacon with a white belt; and Garntyven rock, off RisS, carries an iron pillar. Risv\u00e6rgalten and Haandbo are marked by iron poles. Lekd Fiord. \u2014 From Risv\u00e6r, the Inner Lead continues between EdS and Langholm, and eastward of HvidS, to LekS fiord. When working to windward vessels may pass westward of these islands, and stand in between HvidS and MasS, taking care in doing so to avoid a rock lying 2 cables northward of HvidS. In turning through LekS fiord, the east side of MasS must not be approached nearer than half a mile, but there is deep water close to the mainland. Indre MasSflue is marked by an iron pole. Frdvig Sund. \u2014 At the north end of FrSvig Sund, between LekS and FrovigS, there is a good harbour which may be entered either from the southward or northward. Entering from the southward keep on the west side of the sound; proceed in mid-channel between LekS and FrSvigS, and bring up anywhere between the north point of the latter island and Klungholm, in 7 to 8 fathoms over sand and clay. Vessels from the northward may pass either eastward or westward of Klungholm, but care must be taken to avoid a rock lying close to the north point of that islet. Southward bound vessels may anchor in the bight at Skjei, about a mile northward of Klungholm, in 6 to 8 fathoms, sand and clay ; and there is anchorage for small craft in the cove on the north side of Havneholm.

The province of Nordland, which extends in a north-easterly direction for about 260 miles from Bindals fiord, near LekS, to Anden\u00e6s, the northern extreme of Vesteraalen, comprises an area of 14,251 square miles, and next to Finmarken is the largest Amt in Norway ; it is subdivided into the districts of North and South Helgeland, Sal ten and Lofoten, and Ves teraalen, and contains 56 parishes, with a total population of 101,300. Nordland is unquestionably one of the most interesting parts of Norway, but owing to its distant situation, great extent, and imperfect means of communication, it still contains large tracts of country concerning the natural characteristics of which there is much to be learnt. The coast and \" skjergaard \" are remarkable for their fishing stations (fiske-v\u00e6r), sea fowl colonies,* winding fiords, and stern rugged scenery, which maintains for hundreds of miles a character of surpassing interest and variety ; while n the inner districts beautiful valleys clothed with luxuriant vegetation, mountain plateaux only visited by wandering Lapps with their herds of reindeer, vast glaciers, magnificent falls, subterranean rivers, stalactite caves, nd many other rare phenomena, render the province of Nordland a pecu iarly interesting and attractive field for scientific investigation. There is a marked difference between the characteristics of the outer and inner parts of the principal fiords of Nordland, and in summer the damp chilly air, and rugged scenery of the coast, present a strong contrast to the mild climate and rounded verdant slopes of the districts farther inland. The people of Nordland are a bold and powerful race, with fine well-knit frames, an expressive and sonorous language, and great independence of character. LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO. GENERAL REMARKS.!\u2014 The district of Helgeland lies between the parallels of LekS and Kunna. Between LekS and DSnn\u00e6sS the \" skjer gaard \" extends generally to a distance of 20 to 30 miles from the mainland. * At Lovunen, Varo, and Rost, large numbers of puffins (Fratercula Arctica) are caught by means of trained dogs, and salted down, their feathers also are valuable. t See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Norway, sheet VII., Lekb to Donn\u00e6so, No 2,309."], [299, "281 CUAP. XII.] REMARKS. With the exception of the large islands of LekS, Vegen, AlstenS, and DSn n\u00e6sS, the whole of this space is thickly covered with innumerable small islets surrounded by rocks both above and below water ; the passages leading in from seaward are consequently fewer, longer, and more dangerous than any of those farther south. Between the Vigtens and Vegen, there is only one entrance which might safely be taken without a pilot, namely, the Sklinden channel ; but as even here the distance from the outer rocks to any secure anchorage is about 30 miles, vessels must enter in good time in order to reach a place of safety before nightfall. The various entrances northward of Sklinden are so narrow and difficult that necessity alone would justify strangers in attempting them ; and as the outer islets and rocks are nearly without exception low, and void of any distinctive features, a vessel's position can only be determined by bearings of distant objects. The mountains on the larger islands and the mainland possess, however, such striking characteristics, and attain such an elevation, that in tolerably clear weather they may be recognised at a distance of 40, 50, and even 60 miles, so that there is no difficulty in selecting conspicuous landmarks by which to fix a position before approaching the outer and most dangerous part of the \" skjergaard.\" The depths on the outer rocks are marked on the chart, so that the amount of danger in passing over them may be estimated by the sea that is running ; these rocks break more readily with westerly and north-westerly winds than with those from other directions, partly because these winds raise the heaviest sea, and also because the reefs are generally steep to the westward and north-westward. In describing the entrances from seaward, such harbours only will be mentioned as from their position and security are most likely to be useful ; the anchorages further in will be found under the heading of the Inner Lead. The heights of the principal mountains have been partly determined by barometrical measurements and partly by estimation and comparison. The principal fiords between LekS and DSnn\u00e6sS are Bindals fiord, which forms the boundary between Trondhjems Stift and Nordland ; Vel fiord, which runs in eastward of Vegen ; and Vefsen fiord, which separates AlstenS .from the mainland ; all these fiords have their tributary rivers. MosSen, at the inner end of Vefsen fiord, is finely situated at the mouth of the Vefsenelv, a river of some magnitude ; this place exports large quan tities of timber, felled in the forests of Vefsen, and is rapidly rising in importance. On HalsS, about a mile from MosSen, there are some large saw mills. Pilots. \u2014 Between LekS and Fleinv\u00e6r there is no regular pilot service. During the summer, fishermen will generally be found on the outer shoals,"], [300, "282 LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO. [chap. xii. or they may be expected to come off on a signal being made ; but in stormy weather they cannot venture out in their small open boats. Tides. \u2014 The flood stream sets north-eastward, and the ebb south-west ward, but the north-east going stream is the stronger. When the wind blows steadily in any one direction the tidal stream follows it. It is high water, full and change, at 12h. Springs rise 6 to 7 feet. LANDMARKS. \u2014 When approaching the land 10 miles northward of Vigten islands there will be little difficulty in distinguishing Sklinden v\u00e6r, an isolated group of islets, the largest of which is about 200 feet high. The whole range of the Vigtens will be seen to the southward, and in clear weather, Galtenfjeld, on the mainland, will be visible over them. V\u00e6rumsnubben presents much the same appearance as when seen from the southward (page 274). LekS is about the same height as V\u00e6rumsnubben, and on a pointed knoll rising from the middle of the island stands a beacon, which is a useful object for determining positions by. On the north side of the conspicuous horn-shaped mountain Heil hornet, are three smaller peaks which cannot be seen from the southward. Gutvigfjeld, on the south side of the entrance to Bindals fiord, is long and rounded. Tr\u00e6ln\u00e6shatten has a nearly flat summit, and is somewhat higher than the neighbouring mountains. Farther northward is Andal shatten, a conspicuous cone shaped mountain about 3,000 feet high. The HSiholmtinderne are four sharp peaks about the same height as Andalshatten ; the two central peaks are the smallest and nearest together. When seen from the southward, the mountains on Vegen, (Gulsvaagfjeld and Vegtind), appear to form one block, but being isolated and 2,000 feet high they are easily distinguished. Westward of Vegen is the small island Sola, it is about half as high as Vegtind, and will be known by its precipitous wall-like sides.* ASPECT of COAST from SJOLA (SIOLA).\u2014 If ap- proaching the land on the parallel of Vegen (about 65\u00b0 40' N.), the small islet SjSla, which is inhabited by fishermen, will be seen on the outer edge ofthe \" Skjergaard \"; and the whole of the coast from LekS to Donn\u00e6sS and even as far northward as Lovunen will be in sight at the same time. Donn\u00e6s or Aakvik-fjeld will then be visible at the distance of about 35 miles, it is of nearly the same height as the mountains on Vegen, and has an irregular summit. On the west side of DSnn\u00e6s-fjeld is a detached conical peak named DSnmanden, which serves as a mark for several shoals. The steep, lofty, and sharp peaks on AlstenS, known as the Syr SSstre (Seven Sisters), or Alstadhaug peaks, form a conspicuous and well known land- See View I. on Admiralty chart, No. 2,309."], [301, "283 CHAP. XII.] LANDMARKS \u2014 SKLINDEN. mark, but they appear more distinct from each other when seen from the northward.* A little northward of SSla and Vegen, the remarkable mountain Finkn\u00e6et rises abruptly from the mainland ; it is narrow, and somewhat flat on the top with precipitous sides. Finkn\u00e6et is higher than Heilhornet, but lies farther inland, eastward ofthe entrance to Vistenfiord ; both mountains may be recognised at a distance of 60 or 65 miles. From a position near SjSla, Gulsvaagfjeld and Vegtind stand well out in the foreground, they are separated from each other by a broad valley which is closed when seen from the northward or southward. The trigonometrical beacon on Vegtind is not on the highest point of the mountain, but stands on a round knoll jutting out from the east side of it. When in line with Vegeu, HSiholmtinderne and Andalshatten will be hidden, but if visible present much the same appearance as when seen from the southward. Moesaxlen, a ridge southward of Andalshatten, though much lower stands out distinctly ; and immediately to the south ward is the small sugar-loaf hill Ramtindeu, which serves us a mark for the Storbrak entrance. Tr\u00e6ln\u00e6shatten appears to be separated from the high land southward of Ramtinden by a valley named Rodalskaret, and the most conspicuous object to the southward is Heilhornet. From this point of view LekS appears detached from the mainland, and rises gradually in the centre, with a steep declivity towards the sea.f In the event of a vessel being to the northward of her reckoning, it is possible that the Tr\u00e6n islands might be in sight ; DSnn\u00e6sf jeld and the Seven Sisters would be easily recognised, and in clear weather the HSi holmtinderne would be visible to the southwards SKLINDEN.\u2014 When clear of the rocks off the Vigtens, Sklinden will be easily distinguished. There are passages on both sides of Sklin den-v\u00e6r, but that to the northward is the most spacious, and leads direct to Sklinden harbour where temporary anchorage might be found if thick weather or approaching darkness should render it undesirable to proceed. It must be borne in mind that the distance from Sklinden harbour to any safe anchorage farther in is 25 miles. Dangers Off Sklinden. \u2014 Westward of Sklinden there are four shoals, which break iu anything like a rough sea ; vessels should not attempt to pass between them. Horsgrund, the northernmost of these shoals, carries 6 to 8 fathoms. It will be sufficient guide in passing to the northward of Horsgrund to keep Tr\u00e6ln\u00e6shatten northward of all the * This range presents the characteristic ruggedness of the formation, mica slate, which is here predominent ; the southern peak is 2,800 feet high, and the ascent of the northern peak may be made from Sann\u00e6so (page 294) and Botnet farm. f See Views II. and III. on Admiralty chart, No. 2,309.

On Galttarren, the southernmost shoal, there are 8^to 10 fathoms. The whole of Tr\u00e6ln\u00e6shatten open southward of Sklinden, or that islet bearing E. by N. | N., will lead southward of Galttarren. Findsvaen, a shoal canying 4 to 5 fathoms, lies S.W. by W. \\ W. 44 miles from Sklinden, on the \u25a0north-western extreme of the extensive reefs off RSdS and KvalS. Sklinden in line with the northernmost of the HSiholmtinderne, bearing E. by N. f N. northerly, will lead between Findsvaen and Galttarren ; and a vessel will be eastward of both these shoals when Rundflisen, the northernmost of the small holms lying about 4 miles southward of Sklinden- v\u00e6r, is in line with V\u00e6rumsnubben, bearing S.E. f S. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Entering between Findsvaen and Galttarren, a vessel will be safe as long as Sklinden is kept between Tr\u00e6ln\u00e6shatten and the northern peak of HSiholmtinderne. Breigrund shoal, three-quarters of a mile south-westward of Sklinden, breaks constantly ; and the visible rocks of Sklinden-v\u00e6r may be approached to within half a mile. A vessel may either heave-to off the east side of Sklinden, or stand off and on, and a pilot or fisherman will be almost certain to come off. Sklinden harbour, between Sklinden and Tusholm, has a depth of 10 to 18 fathoms over sand ; the ground is very irregular, and a heavy sea sets in during bad weather, especially with northerly and north-westerly gales. It should therefore only be used in cases of necessity. To enter Sklinden harbour from the northward, give the rocks above water off Sklinden-v\u00e6r a berth of half a mile ; when past the eastern rock steer for the north-east point of Sklinden, proceeding for the anchorage when the sound between Sklinden aud Tusholm is well open. Care must be taken to pass a long cable from the north-east point of Sklinden, as a shoal runs off it to the northward. ENTRANCES from SKLINDEN\u2014 From Sklinden, vessels may proceed northward or southward of LekS, according to circumstances, in either case it is better to steer for the south end of that island until near Mefiordsbo, which lies S.E. by S. 6^ miles from the north-east end of Sklinden, and if covered, always breaks. If intending to proceed southward of LekS, pass 2 or 3 cables westward of Mefiordsbo, and steer South for 6 miles ; this will carry the vessel past Brunflisen, the westernmost of the range of islets extending 6 miles from the south-west part of LekS ; then steer about E. by S. J S., edging to the southward if necessary to give TSrflisen and Nyrene a berth of from one to 2 cables ; when southward of LekS, proceed for the anchorage in FrSvig Sund. The shoals Metaren and Smaataren, southward of TSrflisen and Nyrene, are not dangerous, as they both carry 8 fathoms, and hardly ever break."], [303, "285 CHAP, xii.] SKLINDEN \u2014 LANGO SUND. If the wind is too northerly for the vessel to enter FrSvig Sund, proceed as directed above until past Brunfliseu, and bring the highest point of V\u00e6rumsnubben a little northward of Gj\u00e6ringen, bearing S.E. by S. ; this mark will lead northward of the 6-fathom shoal Verlan ; and when the highest part of LekS bears E.N.E., course may be altered for the northern entrance to Riisv\u00e6rsund which will then bear about S.E. by E. A, E. The entrances between Riisv\u00e6r and LSvS should not be attempted without a pilot. PASSAGE NORTH OF LEKO\u2014 To enter the passage northward of LekS, keep Sklinden bearing N.W..by N. till the vessel is near Mefiordsbo, and after passing southward of that rock, steer E. by S. for about 7 miles ; pass 2 or 3 cables northward of Stensflisene, a line of rocks lying 2 miles north-westward of LekS, and proceed for the small island Melsten, which will be seen nearly in line with the south end of KvalS, on the north side of the entrance to Bindals fiord, bearing about East. When within 3 or 4 miles of Melsten, course may be altered to about E. by N. \\ N., which will lead to Helgelandsflisen ; there is also a channel between Melsten and the shoals to the eastward. Vessels may also pass southward of Kaaterfald and the shoals off Hor tenv\u00e6ret, and northward of Eiuarsfald (all of which break constantly), by keeping the north-east point of Sklinden bearing N.W. by W., or steering S.E. by E. from that point for some object half-way between the highest part of LekS and Heilhornet, until near Stensflisene. Beacons. \u2014 Helgelandsflisen, a rock 2 miles north-eastward of Mel sten, is marked by a yellow stone pyramidal beacon, and there is an iron pole on Uaarsfald, the northern rock on the shoal eastward of Melsten. LANGO SUND, between KvalS and LangS, has good anchorage throughout up to the small holm off the north point of LangS, and might admit of two large vessels mooring. There are 10 fathoms at the south end of the sound, whence the depth decreases gradually northward to 6 fathoms ; the bottom consists of sand and clay. The tidal streams run rather strong through LangS Sund, the flood settling northward, and the ebb southward, and sailing vessels cannot enter when the windis northward of north-west. Directions. \u2014 After passing eastward or westward of Melsten according to the foregoing directions, steer direct for Helgelandsflisen, and pass between that rock and Uaarsfald ; then steer for the north point of Gimling island, which is high and easily distinguished, and haul to the northward between Gjedung and KvalS ; there is a rock off the south-east side of Gjedung, but it is always visible. Proceed between KvalS and the islets to the westward, keeping on the west side of the channel in order"], [304, "286 LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO. [chap. xii. to avoid Vesvikbo, which is also visible ; and bring up anywhere between LangS and KvalS. To enter LangS Sund from Helgelandsflisen, vessels may also pass between Gjedung and Little Gjedung, keeping on the south side of the passage ; or between Little Gjedung and the islets off the south point of LangS, where there is a small harbour with 3 to 4 fathoms over sand and clay. HOIBRAKEN.\u2014 About 11 miles N.N.E. of Sklinden-v\u00e6r is a small solitary holm named HSibraken or Hoibrak, which may be seen at a distance of 4 miles, and 2 miles S.S.W. of it are two rocks above water named Sliflisen ; the whole space between these rocks and Hoibrak is dangerous ground. Ufstaren shoal, on which there are 7 to 8 fathoms, lies on the western extreme of this reef, one mile westward of HSibrak. A vessel will be westward of the HSibrak reefs as long as V\u00e6rumsnubben can be seen southward of Sliflisen. The north side of HSibrak must not be approached nearer than 5 or 6 cables. Should a vessel come upon this part of the coast, course should at once be altered for Sklinden channel, if possible, as the entrances eastward and northward of HSibrak are so difficult that they should only be attempted when absolutely necessary. Before describing these passages it is advisable to mention the outer shoals between Sklinden and Stenene, the western most islets off Vegen, and also those to the eastward of HSibrak. Shoals. \u2014 The outer shoals between Sklinden and HSibrak are Veg taren and Brunan. Vegtaren carries 6 to 8 fathoms, and Brunan, which lies about 2 miles southward of Sliflisen, carries 6 to 7 fathoms. A vessel will be westward of these shoals and the HSibrak reefs as long as Sklinden bears eastward of S. W. Mikalen lies between HSibrak and Stenene; it carries 14 to 15 fathoms, and seldom breaks. A vessel will be northward of Mikalen when the whole of the Seven Sisters, on AlstenS, are open northward of SSla. Storrygsluen, 16 to 18 fathoms, only breaks with a very heavy sea. Blaen carries 6 fathoms. Ufstaren, on which there are 10 to 12 fathoms, is the southernmost of the outer shoals on the north side of Storbrak entrance. Ramtinden, in line with Storbrak (on the highest part of which there are some fisher men's huts), bearing E. A S., leads southward of Ufstaren. Skjeribo (Skieribaaen), on the western edge of the rocky ground off Horsv\u00e6r, is partially uncovered, and breaks always. Marks. \u2014 The highest point of LekS bearing eastward of S. by E. will lead westward of all the shoals between Skjeribo and Mikalen. Ryggefald, on the south side of Storbrak entrance, nearly always breaks ; Storbrak, open southward of Andalshatten, leads northward of it."], [305, "HOIBRAKEN \u2014 STORBRAK ENTRANCE. 287 CHAP. XII.] Kjelsgrund, about 1\u00a3 miles northward of Ryggefald, carries 12 to 14 fathoms. Skudfald lies about 2 miles westward of Storbrak, and generally breaks. STORBRAK ENTRANCE.\u2014 Should it be necessary to seek an anchorage from a position westward of HSibrak, or between that island and Stenene, and circumstances prevent a vessel from taking the Sklinden channel, she may stand in either southward of Sliflisen, or between HSibrak and Mikalen. Great care must be taken not to approach the west, north, or east sides of HSibrak nearer than one mile ; and the highest part of LekS must be kept bearing eastward of S. by E. until the leading marks are clearly distinguished. The fishing huts on Storbrak in line with Ramtinden, bearing East a little southerly, will lead clear of all the outer dangers up to Fiskebo, a rock above water lying W. a N. 1^ miles from Storbrak, but as these marks lead rather close to Ufstaren and Skudfald it is advisable to keep the highest part of Ramtinden a little southward of Storbrak until SSla bears N.E. \\ N. ; then edge to the northward until the same peak is just northward of the huts on Storbrak, and steer about E.N.E., taking care to pass Ryggefald, Skudfald, Fiskebo, and the rocks north-westward of Storbrak at a distance of not less than half a mile. Fishermen may always be obtained from Storbrak in summer ; but in winter the island is deserted. When the huts on Storbrak bear S.S.E. distant IA miles, steer direct for the northernmost of the HSiholmtinderne, taking care to pass at least three-quarters of a mile northward of Ertenbrak and the islets to the east ward, on which there are some fishing huts, and about I-1, miles south ward of Kv\u00e6rsten, where fishermen live both summer and winter. The rocks extending about 3 miles southward from Vegen, and the islands on the opposite side of the channel should be given a berth of about half a mile. Anchorage. \u2014 Having passed the rocks off the south side of Vegen, as directed above, a vessel may proceed for the south point of Ulving, and bring up between that point and the islets to the westward in 6 to 7 fathoms over saud ; but as this harbour is exposed to the southward, it is better to continue between Ulving and the Velfiord holms to Havn Sund, between HavnS and EsS. In the southern part of Havn Sund there is a depth of 5 to 7 fathoms over clay and sand, and at the north end of the sound opposite the houses on HavnS, there are 3 to 4 fathoms. When entering from the southward care must be taken to avoid a shoal lying S.W. by W. x W. 3 to 4 cables from the south point of EsS. The northern entrance is very narrow. Passages East and West of Ertenbrak.\u2014 If unable to lay up for Ulving or Havn Sund, owing to a shift of wind, a vessel might bear"], [306, "288 LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO. [chap. xii. up through the passages eastward or westward of Ertenbrak for the anchorages in LangS Sund, Lyngv\u00e6r, or Sandv\u00e6r. In this case, seamen must depend entirely on the guidance afforded by the tracks marked on the chart,and bearings of the principal islets, as explicit directions cannot be given. Pilots might possibly be obtained from Unsten, Malm, or Hensten, three fishing stations southward of Ertenbrak, which are inhabited through out the year. Mudv\u00e6r entrance. \u2014 About 4 miles northward of Storbrak entrance there is a passage leading to Mudv\u00e6r, a fishing station south-west ward of Vegen, where temporary anchorage might be found ; but as the channel, though over 100 fathoms deep, is so narrow and difficult that the slightest deviation from her course would run a vessel on shore, it within should never be attempted without a pilot. Bremsten. \u2014 Nine miles westward of Vegen, at the fishing station of Bremsten, is a small harbour where vessels of less than 18 feet draught might find shelter with north-westerly or northerly winds. The west side of Stenene, and the north-west side of SjSla (Siola), may be approached to within a few cables, and a pilot will generally come off from Bremsten. The entrance is southward of Svinglebo, which constantly breaks, and northward of Leibrak, which is above water. From half a mile northward of Leibrak steer for the north point of Bremsten, and pass between that and the rocks to the northward ; having rounded the point, and a rock lying close to the east side of it, keep close in to the south end of Bremsten, where there are 3 fathoms, in order to avoid a rock on the opposite side of the channel ; and bring up off the houses in 6 to 7 fathoms over sand. It is impossible to enter from the southward in rough weather, as the sea breaks right across the entrance, and vessels can only enter from the northward when the wind is northward of north-west. Bremsten to Ddnnsesd. \u2014 From Bremsten to 16 miles northward of Vegen the sea is covered so thickly with islets and rocks that it is im possible to find a passage through them, and the only places where shelter might be found in an emergency are the small harbours at Skjerv\u00e6r and Nordv\u00e6r, on the outer extreme of the \" skjergaard,\" 8 miles north-west ward of Vegen. The space westward and southward of DSnn\u00e6sS is equally foul, but there is an entrance southward of Ytterholm which might be taken in case of need, though not without a pilot. Skjerv\u00e6r and Nordv\u00e6r. \u2014 As these fishing stations are in habited a pilot may be expected to come off should the weather permit ; but as the entrances to the harbours are not very difficult the following directions will be sufficient guide if carefully attended to. The highest part of Vegen. bearing S.S.E. A E., will lead to the en trance between Skjerv\u00e6r and Nordv\u00e6r. The entrance to Skjerv\u00e6r"], [307, "289 cnAP. xii.] MUDV\u00c6R ENTRANCE \u2014 INNER LEAD. harbour is close eastward of the western Kraaksundholm, so that when entering a vessel must pass westward of two small holms, Tenholm and the Eastern Kraaksundholm ; this must especially be borne in mind in bad weather, when the sea breaking over the small holms on the west side of the anchorage increases the difficulty of distinguishing the narrow entrance. The anchorage is between the Klep holms and Skjerv\u00e6r; it has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms, sandy bottom. To enter Nordv\u00e6r, bring the highest part of Aakvigfjeld, on DSnn\u00e6sS, in line with SkarvS, the western islet of Nordv\u00e6r ; these marks will lead eastward of Spildra and SkarvSsten, and westward of SkarvSbo, on all of which the sea breaks continually. When the sound between Vikelso and HusS is open, proceed through it, and bring up opposite the highest part ofVikelsS in 6 to 8 fathoms, fine sandy bottom. In bad weather this harbour, though very narrow, is preferable to that at Skjerv\u00e6r, as the entrance is more easily distinguished. Shoals westward Of Ddnn\u00e6SO.\u2014 The outer shoals westward of DSnn\u00e6sS are Bak Svee, Skal Svee, and Lille Svee. Bak Svee and Skal Svee carry 14 to 15 fathoms, and break during heavy gales. Heilhornet, well open westward of SSla, leads westward of these shoals. Lille Svee, on which there are 22 fathoms, hardly ever breaks, and is therefore not dangerous. HestmandS, open northward of Lovunen, leads westward and northward of it. Ytterholm entrance.\u2014 The outer part of the \" skjergaard \" off the south end of DSnn\u00e6sS consists of the Ytter and Inder holms, with the rocks surrounding them. Vessels taking the passage southward of Ytter holm and northward of Flissen will find anchorage eastward of Indre Oksningen, in 6 to 10 fathoms ; also in the narrow sound between BrasS and Pr\u00e6stS; and in the bight at Aakvig, on the south-west side of DSnn\u00e6sS ; but as none of the outer passages on this part of the. coast can be safely navigated without a perfect knowledge of the locality, any attempt to describe such dangerous labyrinths would be misleading rather than useful. INNER LEAD. LEKO FIORD to BRONO SUND\u2014 On leaving LekS fiord, steer direct for Melsten, which may be passed on either side ; and after passing eastward of Helgelandsflisen, bring the beacon on that rock in line with Melsten, which will lead between Lyngv\u00e6ret and GrSnstabben. Torghatten, a rounded hill 800 feet high on Torget island, is in shape some- thing like a sou'-wester hat, and will be easily recognised.* The east side of * The remarkable natural tunnel which perforates Torghatten is 520 feet long in a N.E. and S.W. direction, 70 feet broad and 64 feet high at the north-east end, 36 feet broad and 200 feet high in the middle, 88 feet broad and 239 feet high at the south-west K 740. T"], [308, "LEKd TO DONN\u00c6SO. 290 [chap. xii. Torghatten touching the west side of Moesaxlen will lead westward of Gloven, and eastward of Sandv\u00e6r, up to 'forget, the east side of which is perfectly clear ; thence the channel continues eastward of OrmS, and westward of OrmSgalten, to BrSnS Sund. Should the wind be easterly a vessel may pass eastward of OrmSgalten, keeping close to the south-west point of RSrskjer ; but care must be taken to avoid a shoal extending about a cable southward and eastward from the latter. Beacons. \u2014 In the direct channel between LekS fiord and BrSnS Sund the following islets and shoals are marked by beacons : \u2014 Uaarsfald, on the northern extreme of the shoal eastward of Melsten, marked by an iron pole. Helgelandsflisen : \u2014 pyramidal stone beacon, yellow. GrSnstabben and Gloven : \u2014 iron pillars. HelbergsSen, Sandv\u00e6r : \u2014 stone beacon. Sylskjer, northward of Somn\u00e6sS : \u2014 iron pillar. Ovden, southern end of OrmS: \u2014 stone beacon, black with white belt, surmounted by pole. OrmSgalten : \u2014 cannon with pole. Anchorage. \u2014 Between LekS fiord and BrSnS Sund there are several anchorages on both sides of the Lead. LangS Sund is the first anchorage northward of LekS, and from thence small vessels may pass westward of the rocks off the north side of KvalS, and eastward of Vardskjer, to Lyngv\u00e6ret, where there are 4 to 6 fathoms over sand and clay. A rock lies close to the south-west side of the eastern island, otherwise the sound is clear. Entering from the northward keep well clear of the rocks northward of Lyngv\u00e6ret until the sound is open, and then steer straight in. In Vikraag, north-eastward of Lyngv\u00e6ret, Jelskjer is marked by a black stone beacon with white belt, and Sjulsbo by an iron pillar. Sandv\u00e6r has good anchorage for small craft between F\u00e6S and the narrow islet to the westward, in 7 to 10 fathoms, sand and clay. Entering from the southward steer for the central and highest knoll on Sandv\u00e6rS until the sound is open, and proceed in mid-channel between the cairns on end, and 25,140 cubic fathoms in content ; the floor is highest (457 feet above the sea level), at the north-east end, and lowest in the middle ; the summit of the island is 266 feet above the middle of the roof. The degradation of a vein of mica in the granitic rock of which the island is composed, the action of waves, currents, and ice, and the great Scandinavian upheaval, have been suggested as explaining the formation of the tunnel and its present elevation above the sea. No wave-marks or remains of marine animals are to be found in the tunnel, but this might be accounted for by the consider able disintegration of the rock which has occurred, and still progresses, especially during the spring months ; if this process continues, it will probably convert the tunnel into an open chasm similar to Kinnekloven in Kinn island."], [309, "291 CHAP. XII.] INNER LEAD \u2014 TOFT SUND. the south points of the islands forming the harbour, taking care at the same time to give the south point of F\u00e6S a good berth, as a shoal runs off it to the southward and eastward. The sound is navigable throughout, but the northern entrance is extremely narrow. Amongst the islets south-westward of Torghatten there is anchorage for small craft at HavnS, in 2 to 3 fathoms, sandy bottom. When entering, keep close to the point on which the cairn stands. MSihavn, between Torghatten and OrmS, has 8 to 10 fathoms over clay and sand. The entrance is marked by small cairns. BRONO SUND, between BrSnS and Torget, cannot be safely navi gated without thorough local knowledge, for although the dangers are marked, yet the channels between them are so narrow, and the tidal streams so strong, that slight mistakes have on several occasions led to disaster.* One iron pillar, three iron poles, and three staff and broom beacons mark the various dangers in BrSnS Sund. On the east side of the holms, in the middle of the sound, there is anchor age throughout in 3, 4, or 6 fathoms over hard sand: but owing to the narrowness of the channel, the strength of the tidal streams, and the shoals off the west side of Brono, weighing is attended with difficulty. There is also anchorage near Buholm in 4 to 5 fathoms ; but here also care is necessary, when weighing, to avoid being driven on shore by the tides before the vessel is under command. Seamen are cautioned that no vessel is allowed to lie in the fairway, which, on the west side of Buholm, is only 30 yards wide. LIGHT.\u2014 From Buholm, at the north end of BrSnSsund, afixed white light, elevated 34 feet, and visible 8 miles between the bearings of S. f W.

(which leads west of OrmSgalten) through east to E. by S. a S., is exhibited from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Entering BrSnSsund from the northward at night, care must be laken, after passing westward of Salhusrogn, not to bring Buholm light southward of S. by W. ; this bearing will lead clear up to Buholm, which is clean close to ; and a S.W. course will then lead through the narrow passage westward of the lighthouse to the anchorage. TOFT SUND, a deep clear channel on the west side of Torget, though less direct, is easier than BrSnS Sund. Kv\u00e6rnen rock, which lies in the middle of the sound near the south end, dries at half-ebb, and is marked by an iron pillar ; it may be passed on either side. * Several vessels have been stranded here, even with Norwegian pilots on board. T 2"], [310, "292 LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO. [CHAP. XII. Entering Toft Sund from the southward, pass southward of all the islets and rocks off the south-west side of Torghatten, and haul to the north ward between the small holms Store and Lille Fleinen, continuing along the west side of Torget through the sound. There is anchorage on the west side of Toft Sund, between the two southernmost Stens islets, in 5 to 8 fathoms over fine sand ; the entrances. are between Lilv\u00e6rbratten (which will be known by its height and conical top), and Kirsti holm, and between the latter islet and the Southern StensS. From Toft Sund, vessels may either pass close to the east side of Maaso (between which and the shoals off the western Pr\u00e6stS there is a clear channel), or they may keep to the southward of these shoals and proceed either between or eastward ofthe Pr\u00e6st islands to- the main channel west ward of Salhusrogn. Between the Pr\u00e6st islands there is anchorage in 8 to 10 fathoms, clay and sand. Caution. \u2014 It is advisable for long heavy vessels to pass southward and westward of all the islets and rocks about Torget, except Lille Fleinen, which is clear all round, and re-enter the Inner Lead southward of Ulving ; the additional distance is only about 3 miles, and the channel is far safer and easier. BRONO SUND to DONN\u00c6SO\u2014 From BrSnS Sund to DSnn\u00e6sS the Inner Lead is by no means difficult, and there is everywhere sufficient space for working.

Juledagen, Donn\u00e6ssund : \u2014 iron pole. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 After passing westward of Salhusrogn beacon, and eastward of Taarn\u00e6s Flissene, a N.N.E. course for about 12 miles will lead eastward of Ulving, and westward of HavnS and Sjelva. From one mile N.N.W. of Sjelva beacon the course is N.E. by N. 5 miles to the south end of TiStS, and then N.N.E. nearly 4 miles to Alstadhaug. Having passed 2 or 3 cables westward of Alstadhaug and Kaar holm, steer about N.E. a. n. for 5 miles, passing between Vigholm and ValS galten ; continue along the north-west side of AlstenS, and when westward of Sann\u00e6sS steer direct for BjSrnsodden. With strong off-shore winds, small sailing coasters generally take the passages between RosS and Skaalv\u00e6r, where the wind is more steady and less violent than in the channel between RosS and TiStS. Turning through the channel northward of BrSnS Sund, it must be borne in mind that Saursula hill on MaasS touching the west side of Torghatten, or BrSnS church bearing S. by W. \\ W., will lead eastward of the shoals north of Taarn\u00e6s Flissene. Care must be taken to avoid the shoals off the south point of EsS, and the islets between Sjelva and Minland must not be approached nearer than half a mile ; neither should a vessel stand in between the islets north-eastward of Sommer voxteren. The east side of RosS is clean close-to ; but a shoal extends nearly half a mile from the west side of TiStS northward of Juledagene beacon. There is a passage between Alstadhaug and Kaarholm, but a shoal runs off the south point of the latter nearly 3 cables. The west side of AlstenS is shoal 3 or 4 cables off shore between Hellesvig and Bakskjer ; and off the south side of LSvo is the shoal LSvSgalteu. A shoal extends about one cable from Stamn\u00e6s, westward of the church ; and Ulvansn\u00e6s, northward of Sann\u00e6sS, must not be ap proached within half a mile. With the exception of some rocks off the north side of SkorpS, the channel is then clear up to BjSrnsodden. ANCHORAGES. \u2014 Northward of Pr\u00e6stS there is anchorage at Tilrum on the west side of Moesaxlen, in 6 to 7 fathoms over sand and clay. An annual fair is held at Tilrum. Southward bound vessels might bring up for a time in the narrow sound between the StrSms islands, 2i miles northward of Tilrum ; the entrance is marked by small cairns. The harbours on the south-west side of Ulving, and between HavnS and EsS, have already been described (page|287). Anchorage may also be found at RSrS, on the east side of Vegen. In Smaav\u00e6r, northward of Ulving, there is a very small harbour with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms over sand."], [312, "294 LEKO TO DONN\u00c6SO [CHAP. XII. The cove on the east side of RosS may be used temporarily by vessels bound either way ; but in order to avoid a shoal in the entrance, it is necessary to keep close to the land on the south side, where there is a mooring ring. The sound westward of the north part of RosS, affords fair anchorage throughout. Alstadhaugvaag has anchorage in 10 to 11 fathoms within the entrance, in 8 to 9 fathoms opposite the warehouse belonging to the parsonage, and in 6 to 7 fathoms farther in, over sand and clay ; the inner part of the bay is shoal. South-westerly gales send rather a heavy sea into this harbour. Hellesvig. \u2014 In the bay northward of Hellesvig, which is also known as SSrvikvaag, westward of the Seven Sisters, there is very good anchorage for several large vessels, the depth decreasing gradually from 20 to 7 fathoms over sand and mud. Small vessels bound to the northward may bring up between the HjertS holms in 10 to 11 fathoms, entering northward of the eastern islet. At Sann\u00e6sS, a trading station on the north side of AlstenS, there is a fair small harbour with a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms opposite the jetty, over sand and clay. The shoal off Stann\u00e6s must be avoided when entering from the westward. At BjSrns Markedsplads, a large village on the south-east side of DSnn\u00e6sS where the principal Nordland fairs are held, there is a good harbour for vessels of moderate size, with a depth of 7 to 10 fathoms over sand and clay. A shoal extends about one cable north-eastward from the point on the south side of the entrance. There is also anchorage in 8 to 12 fathoms in the sound westward of BjSrnsholm, which is more easily left than the inner harbour."], [313, "295 CHAPTER XIII. DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA.

There are several islands of considerable size on this part of the coast, but DSnn\u00e6sS is far the largest. The entrances from seaward |are long and difficult, and the outer islets are so low that a vessel's position can only be determined by the bearings of mountains on the mainland or larger islands. The group of islands known as Tr\u00e6nen, which lies 24 miles from the mainland on the Arctic Circle is therefore invaluable either as a landmark or point of departure, as its precipitous peaks are visible in clear weather at least 40 miles; and cannot be mistaken for any others. Tr\u00e6nen has two good harbours, one or other of which may be made available with any wind ; the entrances are somewhat narrow, but the leading marks are so clearly defined that unless the weather is singularly unfavourable, the chart and directions will be sufficient guide. Fondalen, or as it is sometimes named Svartisan, a range of glacier bearing mountains between Ranen and Salten fiords, is one of the most remarkable features of this part of Norway, and as there is no other snowfield so near the sea on any other part of the coast, it cannot be mistaken. Blaamanden, one of the glaciers of the Sulitelma group, east ward of BodS, lies so far inland that it is hardly visible from an offing of 10 to 15 miles beyond the outer rocks, or 30 to 35 miles from the mainland, while the great snowfield of Fondalen, reaching as it does almost to the coast, may be seen distinctly at a great distance ; in the spring, and during cold summers it is snow white, but in warm summers, when the surface snow disappears, it has a clear bluish green colour.f * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Norway, sheet VII. Donn\u00e6so to Fleina, No. 2,310. f Fondalen is said to extend through 50' of latitude, with a breadth of from 15 to 30 miles ; it is perhaps the largest snowfield in Norway, and is the only one that sends glaciers actually into the sea ; as yet, however, it is but little explored, and has"], [314, "DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. 296 [chap. xiii. Of the numerous fiords which penetrate this part of the coast, the Ranen and Sionen fiords, eastward of DSnn\u00e6sS and TommenS, are the principal ; the former extends about 30 miles inland, and several rivers] fall into it. Mo, a flourishing little place at the inner end of Ranen fiord, is the centre for the Swedish trade in Nordland, and the proposed starting point for a line of railway between Norway, Sweden, and Finland, which might be ex tended as far north as RSsvik in Folden, and as far south as Trondhjem. There is also a flourishing village at Hann\u00e6sbierg, which separates the north and south Ranen fiords. The inhabitants of Ranen are noted for their skill in boat-building, which is carried on to a considerable extent. Timber is also exported from Ranen. Pilots are stationed at Fleinv\u00e6r (page 314). Tides. \u2014 Between DSnn\u00e6sS and Tranen, the tidal streams take the same course as between LekS,' and DSnn\u00e6sS (page 282) ; northward of Tr\u00e6nen the tidal stream is uncertain, generally setting outwards from the coast past the Lofotens, but depending in a great measure upon the prevailing winds. It is high water, full and change, at Tr\u00e6nen, at 1 lh. 45m. Springs rise 7 feet. LANDMARKS. \u2014 The landmarks on this part of the coast are far more distinct and conspicuous than any to be found farther north. The high peaks on the mainland and larger islands, which often rise to a height of several thousand feet above the sea level, may be seen at a distance of 40 or 50 miles, and sometimes even farther ; their rugged Alp like forms are easily recognised, and do not materially alter their ap pearance when viewed from different positions ; in tolerably clear weather a vessel's position can therefore be determined with ease and certainty. Tr\u00e6nS or Tr\u00e6n island, the principal island of the Tr\u00e6nen group, is by far the most important landmark on this part of the coast ; it is divided into four peaks, which rise to the height of about 1,000 feet, and as already observed may be seen at a distance of 40 miles. Tr\u00e6nstaven, the northernmost and highest of these peaks, is entirely separated from the others, and forms a nearly perfect cone. The two middle peaks (Miaatin derne), are close together, and will be nearly in line when bearing about N.E. or S.W. The southern peak, Gumpen, has a precipitous face towards the south, but slopes gradually on the opposite side towards the Miaatin derne, which it joins at about half their height, and is therefore less never been accurately surveyed. On the seaward side of Fondalen a glacier of the first order descends to the Nord fiord, a small branch of the Mel fiord, and three others descend to the Holandsfiord, which is the innermost part of the Skars fiord. On the landward side is a glacier named Hatvisvagge J\u00e6kna, in lat. 66\u00b0 47'. The eastern boundary of this snowfield touches Storm- vand and Eiter-vand ; and, farther south, a considerable glacier descends to the Svartis-vand, or lake, which it partially fills."], [315, "CHAP, xiii.] 297 LANDMARKS. isolated than Tr\u00e6nstaven. On nearing the coast the small but steep hills of DSrv\u00e6r will be seen to the north-eastward of Tr\u00e6nen ; the southern most is the highest, and there is a smaller peak close to the northward of it. The three peaks on Orka, the northernmost island of DSrv\u00e6r, are in line on an easterly bearing.* From the vicinity of Tr\u00e6nen, the coast is visible in clear weather as far southward as Vegen and SSla, while Kunna will be just in sight to the northward. RSdS or RSd LovenS is a conspicuous island something in shape like a crouching lion ; and between RSdS and HestmandS, which appears just northward of Tr\u00e6nstaven when the latter bears East, is a lower island with sloping sides, named N\u00e6sS. HestmandS is over 1 ,600 feet high, with a sharp summit, and stands out distinctly from the jagged peaks on the mainland. Lovunen, which is about 2,000 feet high, and appears isolated, is easily recognised by its steep, nearly perpendicular fall, to the westward, and its gradual slope towards the mainland ; it appears rounder when bearing between North and E.S.E., but when seen from any other position has about the same appearance as^that shown in the view on the chart.* South eastward of Lovunen are the Tomtinderne, three high peaks on TommenS ; the northernmost of these, Tomskj\u00e6lven, is separated from the others, and is cone-shaped like Tr\u00e6nstaven, but with a broader base in proportion to its height ; the two southern peaks are not so sharp. LurS, an island about 1,600 feet high, with rounder and less abrupt declcvities than those in its vicinity, lies between the Tomtinderne and HestmandS ; and east ward of LurS is the Oxtinden, a lofty blunt cone of rock on the mainland. The Seven Sisters on AlstenS, Aakvigfjeld on DSnn\u00e6sS, and HSiholmtin derne, will be visible southward of Lovunen ; aud in clear weather the snowfield of Fondalen will be plainly seen. Northward of Tomtinderne the mountains present very different characteristics to those farther south ward, their outlines being more sharply defined, jagged, and torn, while they are also generally patched with snow during the whole summer. Of the landmarks j ustmentioned, Tr\u00e6nen, DSrv\u00e6r, HestmandS, and Lovunen, are the most important, as with the help of these it is easy to make one of the Tr\u00e6nen harbours. When approaching the coast northward of Tr\u00e6nen, the southernmost of the Lofoten islands will be visible in clear weather ; Sandhornet, a mountain at the entrance to Beiern fiord, which rises to the height of about 3,000 feet, with a precipitous face to the westward, and the islands Fleina and FuglS, will also be easily recognised. Fleina is low, FuglS is high and steep, and in cold summers has patches of snow on it. About 8 miles south-westward of FuglS is the conspicuous headland of Kunna, which is only connected with the mainland by a strip of flat alluvium, and has, therefore, the appearance of an island. Southward of Kunna the outlines of * See View on Admiralty chart No. 2,310."], [316, "298 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [chap. xiii. the land become gradually more indistinct till terminated by the peak of HestmandS, which is still just visible. The great snowfield of Fondalen will be unmistakable, its appearance differing in a marked manner from that of the dark and riven peaks in the foreground, amongst which MelStind and Bolgen are conspicuous. During the winter, when all the mountains are covered with snow, Fondalen is still distinguishable, because when seen from the offing it appears to run parallel with the horizon with hardly any depressions or peaks ; the highest part only will show some dark patches of bare rock amongst the snow.* LIGHT. \u2014 On SSholm, the southern islet of Tr\u00e6nen, 5 miles south ward of Tr\u00e6nstaven, stands a red iron lighthouse, from which is exhibited at an elevation of 118 feet, a flashing white light, showing a flash of twelve seconds' duration every minute. The light, which should be visible 17 miles in clear weather, is shown from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. ENTRANCES FROM SEAWARD. FLOHOLM fishing station, which is inhabited during the summer, is the outermost group westward of DSnn\u00e6sS ; it lies about 20 miles south-westward of Tr\u00e6nen, and is composed -of several small islets sur rouuded by rocks and shoals. About 4 miles north-eastward of the Floholms is the Svee shoal, on which there are 12 fathoms ; and between this shoal and Ovskallen (which carries 6 fathoms and lies 2 miles south ward of SSholm), there are no dangers. The southernmost of the Tomtin derne, in line with Aasv\u00e6r lighthouse leads northward of Svee shoal ; and a vessel will be southward of Ovskallen as long as Tomskj\u00e6lven is well open southward of Lovunen. BETWEEN LOVUNEN and AASV\u00c6R.\u2014 If southward of Tr\u00e6nen, and unable to make the harbours in that group, vessels may stand in between Lovunen and Aasv\u00e6r, but care must be taken to enter in good time, as with the wind on shore it would be difficult to clear Floholm and the shoals to the south-westward, and for a distance of over 60 miles. or as far southward as Sklinden, there is not a single entrance that can be safely taken without a pilot, as explained in the last chapter. LIGHT. \u2014 On Andeisbak,the north-eastern islet of Aasv\u00e6r, stands a white concrete building, from which is exhibited a fixed light, elevated 45 feet, and visible 11 miles. The light i3 white and red, visible between the bearings of E. by S. \\ S. (through south and west) and N. by E. \\ E.

A W. to N. by E.A E. : it is shown from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. * See View on Admiralty chart No. 2,310."], [317, "299 CHAP. XIII.] FLOHOLM \u2014 SHOALS OFF TR\u0152NEN. The bearing E. by S. \\ S. leads northward of the north-western rocks off Aasv\u00e6r ; the bearing W. by N. \u00a7 N. leads southward of the rocks off Synstholm, and the bearing N.W. by W. W. leads north of DSnn\u00e6sS, but south of UdSbo. Beacons. \u2014 A rock south-eastward of Synstholm, and the shoal UdSbo, which lies three-quarters of a mile from the north point of DSnn\u00e6sS, are marked by iron pillars. RisS and Kvalhousen, in Aasv\u00e6r, are distinguished by wooden beacons. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The channel between Lovunen and Aasv\u00e6r is not difficult with daylight and clear weather, when the inner mountains, especially the Tomtinderne, can be seen ; fishermen will come off from Aasv\u00e6r in almost any weather. The southernmost nf the Tomtinderne, bear ing E. by S. | S. will lead northward of Aasv\u00e6r, and Andersbak lighthouse bearing S.E. leads southward of Ovskallen and the foul ground off Lovunen. Vessels may either pass close northward of Andersbak, and bring up in 20 fathoms on a bank of soundings close eastward of the lighthouse (whence there are passages leading to the inner harbours of Aasv\u00e6r), or, after passing nearly half a mile southward of Synstholm they may steer for the north point of DSnn\u00e6sS, and bring up in NordS vaagen in 6 to 10 fathoms over clay and sand ; UdSbo might be passed on either side. There are secure anchorages amongst the islets of Aasv\u00e6r, but the entrances cannot be described with sufficient accuracy to enable strangers to take them without a pilot. The other available anchorages within 5 miles of the north point of DSnn\u00e6sS are Riisv\u00e6r, Hofsvaag, and Gleinsvaag. At night. \u2014 Entering the channel between Lovunen and Aasv\u00e6r at night, steer direct for Andersbak light, taking care not to bring it to bear southward of S.E., in order to avoid the shoals off Lovunen. After passing close northward of Andersbak, vessels may either bring up as directed above, or proceed farther in, keeping within the red sector of light, which will lead clear of everything except UdSbo and the shoals westward of TommenS. Channels and anchorages westward of Donn\u00e6so.\u2014 Between the various fishing stations and groups of islets westward of DSnn\u00e6sS, there are several practicable channels ; these are, however, too intricate and dangerous to be attempted without a pilot. The harbours on the west side of DSnn\u00e6sS are Aakvig ; SSrvig, in 7 to 8 fathoms ; Nordvi\" trading station, in 12 to 16 fathoms ; and the cove westward of DSnn\u00e6s church, in 8 to 10 fathoms; in all of these the bottom consists of sand and clay. SHOALS Off TR\u0152NEN.\u2014 The following shoals must be avoided when bound into Tr\u00e6nen harbour from the westward. It is not easy for"], [318, "300 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [ CHAP. XIII. strangers to distinguish the various small islets which are given as marks for these shoals, neither is it necessary that they should, as reliance may be placed on the leading marks given for the entrances. Nord Miaagrund, 5 fathoms, lies N.W. by W. I W. about 2 miles from the north point of Tr\u00e6nen, with the northern slope of Lovunen in line with the south extreme of Tr\u00e6nen, and Orkatinderne in line with Bremholm. Katten, 6 fathoms, lies N.W. by W. \u00a7 W. nearly 1| miles from Alvor, the western extreme of Tr\u00e6nen, with the south point of DSrv\u00e6r a little northward of Tr\u00e6nstaven, and the northern slope of Lovunen southward of Sjyrsholm, a whitish islet south-westward of Gumpen. Solken, 10 fathoms, lies W. by N. \\ N. 2 miles from Alvor, with Lovunkn\u00e6erne, two white knolls on Lovunen, westward of the highest part of the island, visible over the north part of Flottingen, and the south point of DSrv\u00e6r a little northward of Tr\u00e6nstaven. GaUVen, which only carries 2 fathoms and nearly always breaks, lies W. by S. \\ S. If miles from Alvor, the western extreme of Tr\u00e6nen. CLEARING MARKS.\u2014 So long as BSval, a rather dark islet about three-quarters of a mile southward of Gauven, is shut in with Lovunen a vessel will be well southward of all the above shoals. The west sides of BSval and Froa may be approached to within 2 or 3 cables. ENTRANCES to TR\u00c6NEN.\u2014 It will depend upon the direc tion of the wind, and whether DSrv\u00e6r,' HestmandS, or Lovunen, can be seen most distinctly, which of the following entrances to Tr\u00e6nen will be the most convenient. Vessels should not attempt to make the Tr\u00e6nen harbours from the westward during strong southerly winds, as heavy squalls then sweep down from Tr\u00e6nstaven in different directions. Between Gauven and Solken.\u2014 When Tr\u00e6nstaven bears E. iN. the southernmost and highest peak of DSrv\u00e6r will be visible close northward of it ; these marks will lead between Gauven and Solken to Alvorsbo, which will be seen breaking right ahead ; pass northward of this shoal, and continue between Tr\u00e6nen and Stavfjeldbo, which always breaks. The north side of Tr\u00e6nen is clean close-to, with the exception of a small rock close to the north-east side of Tr\u00e6nstaven. After passing Stavfjeldbo, steer so as to pass close northward of Flessa, a small holm distinguished by a cairn, off the east side of Tr\u00e6nstaven, and then haul to the southward for the anchorage. Vessels may bring up in the outer harbour, either just southward of Flessa, or off the houses at the foot of Tr\u00e6nstaven, in 6 to 7 fathoms over clay and sand ; farther eastward, near the island on which the church stands, there are 10 to 12 fathoms. Fresh running water can be obtained, both in summer and winter, close to the houses under Tr\u00e6nstaven."], [319, "CHAP, xin.] 301 TR\u00c6NEN. From the outer harbour, vessels may either warp or sail to the inner anchorage eastward of the church, but a pilot should be engaged to point out the channel. Between Katten and Nord Miaagrund \u2014 When Tr\u00e6n- staven bears about E. by S. A S. HestmandS will be northward of Tr\u00e6nS. When standing in, keep HestmandS so far northward of Tr\u00e6nstaven that the opening between the two shall be equal to that between Tr\u00e6nstaven and the Miaatinderne ; these marks will lead between Katten and Nord Miaa grund, and when the breakers on Stavfjeldbo are visible, proceed as directed above. As a farther guide for this channel, in case HestmandS cannot be seen owing to thick weather, it is intended to erect a beacon on SandS, a small island north-eastward of Tr\u00e6nS, which is to be kept northward of Tr\u00e6n staven when standing in. North of Nord Miaagrund. \u2014 Entering northward of Nord Miaagrund, keep the southern slope of Lovunen close southward of Gumpen, and take care not to stand so far to the southward that the whole of Lovunen can be seen ; when near Tr\u00e6nen, course may be altered for the outer harbour. In this entrance the depths vary from 20 to 50 fathoms, therefore it is possible that in very heavy gales the sea might break ; in the two former channels the depth is about 40 fathoms. Southward Of Alvor and Gumpen there is a fair channel leading both to the outer and inner Tr\u00e6nen harbours. To make the outer harbour, pass close to the south point and east side of Tr\u00e6nS, passing west ward of the shoal which lies a little southward of the east point of that island. When proceeding for the inner harbour, give the north side of Spanne a good berth, and continue between HeS and RensSgalten (the brown weed on this shoal can always be seen under water). Hikilen is a lofty, abrupt, and narrow peak on an islet northward of SurenS, the eastern holm on the south side of the channel, and close eastward of Hikilen is the small islet of Lille Haksholm. Pass close southward of Hikilen, proceed in mid-channel through the sound eastward of Lille Haksholm, and bring up iu the inner harbour, off the houses southward of the church, in 7 to 8 fathoms, over clay and sand. Shoals SOUth Of Tr\u00e6nen. \u2014 The whole space between Ovskallen and the channel southward of Alvor and Gumpen, a distance of nearly 6 miles, is occupied by islets and rocks, between which there is no navigable channel.

Entering from seaward, take care to keep Tomskj\u00e6lven southward of the south point of Lovunen until Baadskjer, the easternmost round black rock eastward of SSholm, is nearly in line with Tr\u00e6nstaven ; then haul to the northward, passing 2 or 3 cables eastward of Baadskjer, and bring Orkatinderne close eastward of SkarvS, the eastern most and highest round islet of Tr\u00e6nen ; these marks will lead westward of SurenSbo, and when Hikilen is made out, course may be altered to pass eastward of SurenS and Lille Haksholm to the inner harbour. If the wind is strong from the north-westward, or it is considered un advisible to attempt the inner harbour without a pilot, vessels may either heave-to to leeward of DSrv\u00e6r, or if the weather is fine they may bring up eastward of the eastern islets of Tr\u00e6nen, which may be approached to within one or 2 cables, and a pilot will almost always come off on a signal being made. DSrv\u00e6r bearing N.E. \\ N. will lead eastward of SurenSbo. Dorvser harbour. \u2014 Under the circumstances just mentioned, anchorage might also be found amongst the DSrv\u00e6r islets. To enter the harbour, keep the highest peak of DSrv\u00e6r bearing N.E. i N. until suffi ciently near to distinguish the southernmost round islet of the group ; pass close to the west side of this islet, then steer up the sound, and bring up far enough in to be sheltered from wind and sea, in 5 to 6 fathoms. The sound is very narrow, especially at the entrance, and in one place a depth of only 2\\ fathoms has been reported. Kvalholm, about 3 miles north-eastward of Lovunen, is the outer anchorage in Tr\u00e6n fiord, and will afford shelter if a north-westerly gale renders it impossible to make Tr\u00e6nen ; it may be entered either from the eastward or westward. After passing Ovskallen according to the foregoing directions, steer about N.E. by E. A E. until the southernmost of the Tomtinderne is visible northward of Lovunen. The vessel will then be past Felting, a 9-fathom patch on the north-western extreme of the foul ground off Lovunen, and course may be altered to pass either northward or southward of Kvalholm. LurS, kept northward of Kvalholm, will lead to the eastern entrance, aud after giving the east point of Kvalholm a berth of 2 cables to clear the shoal which runs off it, a vessel may proceed in mid-channel through the sound to the westward, where there is anchorage off the middle of Kvalholm in 14 to 15 fathoms, over clay and sand. LurS, shut in with the south side of Kvalholm, will lead up to the western entrance to the sound, but care must be taken to avoid the rocks off Lovunen, which extend the whole way from Felting to the islets south of Kvalholm. Var6 and ROSO. \u2014 If wishing to proceed farther in from Kvalholm, pass half a mile northward of Kvitingen, a cluster of small white holms northward of Solv\u00e6r, and steer about S.E. by E. until Eggelose, a round"], [321, "chap xiii.] DORV\u00c6R HARBOUR \u2014 T\u00c6NHOLM ENTRANCE. 303 islet covered with heather, can be seen ahead. From Eggelose, which may be passed ou either side, vessels may proceed southward of OnS and Sjono to Sti fiord, or they may steer for the south point of VarS, and bring up between that island and RSsS, in 7 to 10 fathoms, over clay and sand. When entering the harbour, keep close in to the south point of VarS in order to avoid a rock, on the south side of the entrance, which dries at half ebb. The small harbour on the south-west side of RSsS has a depth of 12 fathoms, and is secure in all weathers. There are passages between and westward ofthe two holms off the entrance, but they are very narrow. There is also anchorage between the south-east point of RSsS and the islet to the eastward in 7 to 8 fathoms. Erkneskjer, RSsosund, is marked by a stone beacon surmounted by a white cross. The other harbours on this part of the coast are described under the heading of the Inner Lead. Ydre Mykoeme. \u2014 The outer islets and rocks of the \" skjergaard \" north-eastward of Tr\u00e6nen should not be approached within several miles ; vessels of light draught might however, if necessary, bring up to wait wind or tide between the islands known as Ydre MykSerne. This is the only anchorage to be found amongst the outlying islets between Tr\u00e6nen and Fleina, and it is easy of access. When approaching from the northward, vessels should beat to the southward of the group if the wind is foul, and then run straight up the sound. With a fair wind the north entrance may be taken. In the principal sound, between the island on which the houses stand and that to the northward, there are 4, 5, and 6 fathoms, over rocky ground with patches of sand ; there is also anchorage in the smaller sound to the south-eastward. Mykoeme to Fleina. \u2014 About 6 miles eastward of MykSerne is a group of islets named Valv\u00e6r ; \u2022 they are uninhabited, and there is no anchorage either here or in the groups to the eastward and north-east ward, viz., Skjerv\u00e6r, T\u00e6nholmerne, GrSnna, and R\u00e6vskind. TSBnholm entrance. \u2014 Between the T\u00e6nholm group and Skjerv\u00e6r there is a passage leading in from seaward to the channels northward of MelSv\u00e6r. Entering from seaward, care must be taken to avoid the reefs Sveebo and Liosbo, which are generally marked by breakers. Torgrund, a 12-fathom patch three quarters of a mile eastward ofthe north end of Sveebo, lies 3^ miles westward of Kols islets. When about 2 miles eastward of Kols islets, vessels may either edge to the northward and proceed through Stableleden, or they may steer for the opening south of SSrstot, taking care to avoid South Bredgrund, and proceed according to circumstances."], [322, "304 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [chap, xiii. There is also a passage southward of GrSnna, for which bearings of Kunna and FuglS would be the best guides. INNER LEAD. BJORNSODDEN to MELOV\u00c6R\u2014 From BjSrnsodden (the south-east point of DSnn\u00e6sS northward of BjSrns Markedsplads), the coast ing steam vessels usually take the intricate channels leading westward of LSkten, TommenS, and LurS, to HestmandS, as there are trading stations all along the route ; from HestmandS there are several passages leading to MelSv\u00e6r. When making a passage, the channels leading eastward of the above islands, through Sti fiord and southward of RangsundS, are far preferable, as they are spacious and free from dangers. When turning through the latter channel, the West side of Hanu\u00e6sS, northward of Valla, must not be approached nearer than 3 cables ; and care must be taken to avoid Kjer ringskjer, which lies 2 good miles from the north side of TommenS, with Tomskaj\u00e6lven bearing S.S.W. | W. westerly. The channel eastward of RenS affords more room for working than that to the westward, and is free from dangers, with the exception of a shoal extending about 1^ cables from the north point of the island. Anchorage may be found between Hann\u00e6sholm and the south-west point of Hann\u00e6sS, and also at Kvitv\u00e6r.

After passing Mangvardene, keep the east side ofthe round heather covered islet EggelSse inline with the west side of Kvitv\u00e6rko, or, if turning through keep half of EggelSse visible westward of Rundholm, the high round islet close eastward of Kvitv\u00e6rko ; and do not stand in amongst the rocks eastward of Solv\u00e6r. Kvitv\u00e6rko and EggelSse may be passed on either side, and the track then leads close eastward of SSrv\u00e6r, and westward of a shoal off Korsholm ; the latter islet must then be kept eastward of EggelSse until Sorv\u00e6r is passed, when course may be altered for Andklakkene, three round hillocks south eastward of HestmandS. There is a much better channel between SSrv\u00e6r and Maav\u00e6r, but when turning through vessels must not stand in amongst the rocks southward of Maav\u00e6r, and care must be taken to avoid a shoal lying 2 or 3 cables from the west point of GrydS. There are passages eastward and westward of Andklakkene, and also between them. To pass to the westward, which is the safest course, give the west sides of Dragskjer and BlikS a fair berth, taking care to avoid the rocks southward of BukS, and continue in mid-channel between Klubholm and the island to the eastward. The entrance to the eastern passage is between Andholm and Dragskjer, both of which must be given a berth of at least one cable ; proceed eastward of BlikS and Andklakkene, giving the eastern AndklakhSi (Andklak height) a fair berth, in order to avoid a rock lying close in shore, and continue between KjSbmandskjer and the north point of the western Andklakke, keeping in mid-channel to avoid the shoals on either side of the passage. KjSbmandskjer is a small black rock with a cairn on it. The channel between the Andklakke islets is seldom used except as an entrance to the anchorage, being foul and narrow. A vessel should steer N.E. by E. for about 2\\ miles from Andklakkene to BiSrnS, whence the houses in SelsSvik and the sound westward of SelsS will be visible. Give Klofittingeu a good berth to avoid the shoal which runs off N.N.W. from it and proceed through SelsSsund passing on either side of the high islet Ornstol, off the north point of SelsS, and from thence between GierS and GierS-v\u00e6r, and through Gi\u00e6ro-v\u00e6r to Rod LSvenS. This passage cannot be recommended, as it is narrow, diffi cult, and for strangers almost impracticable ; after passing Ornstol it is K 740. f"], [324, "306 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [chap. xiii. better to proceed either through HundsrSven, the narrow sound southward of GierS, or between RangsundS and the' island to the northward ; but, as already observed, the passage southward of RangsundS is the best of all. There are shoals on both sides of the eastern entrance to HundsrSven, otherwise the sound is deep, and has a good small harbour with a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms, over sand. Caution is necessary when hauling to the east ward from Ornstol, as if the wind is fresh from the south-eastward it will be dead foul between RangsundS and GierS, with very heavy squalls off the land. There are no dangers in the channel eastward of GierS, and a vessel might bring up to wait wind or tide between the northernmost islets off the north-west side of Reno, The highest part of SvinS, westward of the western slope of Bolgen, is the mark for passing eastward of the rocks off the south end of RSd LSvenS, but it is better to keep more on the east side of the channel, and when turning through, S\u00e6tvigodden must not be approached nearer than 2 cables. Besides the above passages there is a good channel leading westward of GierS-v\u00e6r and Gi\u00e6so-v\u00e6r, and northward of RSd LSvenS. From RSd LSvenS, the Inner Lead continues between SvinS and Omn\u00e6sS or OmS to MelSv\u00e6r. ANCHORAGES. \u2014 Between BjSrns Markedsplads and MelSv\u00e6r are the following anchorages :\u2014 Gleinsvaag, on the east side of DSnn\u00e6sS, 3^ miles northward of BjSrnsodden, is a small but secure harbour for northward bound vessels ; it has a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms over good holding ground, and there are mooring rings on both sides. Keep in mid-channel when entering, as there is foul ground off the points on either side of the entrance. Hofsvaag. \u2014 There is good anchorage in the bights northward and southward of the projecting point at Hof, on the *west side of LSkten. On the north side of the point there are 6 to 8 fathoms, and on the south side 10 to 14 fathoms, shoaling to 8 and 6 fathoms farther in; the bottom consists of sand and clay. Hjerto. \u2014 There is anchorage for small craft among the islets off the south-west side of TommenS, in 2 to 3 fathoms over sand. After passing 4 or 5 cables southward of HjertSbo, steer for the highest part of HjertS till close in, and bring up in the sound to the eastward. There is also an entrance between the islets and rocks northward of HjertS, but it is very intricate and dangerous. NordOVaag is the northernmost harbour of DSnn\u00e6sS ; it has a depth of 5 to 10 fathoms, over clay and sand. Riisv\u00e6r, southward of Manvgarderne, has a small but good harbour on the west side of BukS, with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms. To enter it"], [325, "chap, un.] HUNDSROVEN \u2014 ANDKLAKKENE. 307 give the south-west side of Hangskjer a good berth, pass westward of Veiskjer, on which there is a small stone beacon, and proceed for the anchorage ; the northern entrance is blocked by a shoal. There are two tolerably high stone beacons on Buko, which will be visible in clear weather from DSnn\u00e6sS. There is also a stopping place close northward of Riisv\u00e6r, but care must be taken to avoid the shoals to the northward. Mangvarderne. \u2014 Small craft might bring up during a calm be- tween Lille and Store Mangvarden, but when weighing, care must be taken to avoid the rocks off the north point of Lille Mangvarden and ' Seiskjer. Reid. \u2014 There is good anchorage between the east side of RelS and the three Havn rocks, on each of which stands a small cairn, in 3 to 5 fathoms, over clay and sand. Vessels may either pass northward of the Havn rocks, giving the north-eastern point of the eastern rock a fair berth, or between the middle and south rocks. KvitVSBT. \u2014 On the west side of Kvitv\u00e6r is a small snug harbour, with a depth of 8 to 9 fathoms over sand. Entering from the southward, pass eastward of Bestefarskjer, and westward of a small shoal on the east side of the entrance to the anchorage. If coming from the northward pass westward of Svartskjer, proceed in mid-channel for the harbour, and bring up westward of the warehouses. Lyngv\u00e6r, northward of VarS and RosS has anchorage for small craft in 3 fathoms, but the entrance is difficult for strangers. Sorv\u00e6r has anchorage in three different sounds between the islets on the east side of the group, in 3 to 5 fathoms ; these anchorages though very narrow are often used, being close to the fairway, and secure in all weathers ; tho entrances are marked by small cairns. Kv\u00e6r6. \u2014 Vessels taking the eastern channels will find temporary anchorage on the east side of West Kv\u00e6rS at the north end of Sti fiord ; it may be entered either from the southward or northward. Andklakkene. \u2014 Entering'the passage between the Andklakke islets from the southward, pass westward of the south point of BlikS, and keep the east point of the western Andklakke touching the west point of the middle islet, which will lead between the rocks southward of BukS and westward of BlikS ; when these are passed proceed for the anchorage, and bring up either abreast of the houses in 6 to 8 fathoms, or southward of the middle Andklakke in 10 to 12 fathoms, over clay and sand. The northern part of the sound is only 8 or 9 feet deep at low water, therefore vessels of greater draught coming from the northward must pass eastward or west ward of the group, and either enter from the southward or betweei Andklakkene and BlikS. The Andklakke islets and KjSbmandskjer will be visible from SelsSsund and RangsundS. u 2"], [326, "308 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [chap. xiii. SelSOSUnd has good anchorage in 12 to 14 fathoms, over sand, and in the small bight near the houses there are 5 to 7 fathoms. R6d L6ven6. \u2014 In summer, or during a calm, small vessels may bring up between the islets off the south side of RSd LSvenS. R6d6rOSO, on the north-east side of RSd LSvenS, is a very good small harbour ; it has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms, sandy bottom, and may be entered either from the southward or northward. The entrances are xery narrow, but not difficult, and there are rings for mooring and warping. Svinv\u00e6r. \u2014 In the sound northward of SvinS, there is anchorage off rhe houses, and also further to the westward, in 3 to 4 fathoms over sand. The southern entrance is clear, but the northern entrance is so foul that it can only be used by those thoroughly acquainted with the locality. There is a sunken rock in the middle of the passage between the two anchorages. Omn\u00e6SO. \u2014 In the narrow sound between the west point of Oran\u00e6sS and the island to the westward there is anchorage in 5 to 7 fathoms, over sand. This harbour, though often used, is by no means good ; it may be entered either from the northward or southward. Mefiordholm. \u2014 Southward bound vessels will find temporary anchorage between the Mefiordholms, north-westward of Omn\u00e6sS harbour. OMN\u00c6SO to KUNNA.\u2014 Although the fairway between RSd LSvenS and MelSv\u00e6r is so spacious and free from dangers, it is not advisable for southward bound vessels to leave MelSv\u00e6r when it is blowing' from the southward or south-eastward. It is peculiar to the reach between Omn\u00e6sS and Kunna that off-shore winds, or those from north-east to S.S.E. do not blow so hard there as farther to the southward, and it gene rally happens that if MelSv\u00e6r is left with a light easterly wind, a south easterly or southerly gale, with rain, is encountered in the vicinitv of RSd LSvenS. This part of the coast is therefore kEOwn as \" Denstille Fjerding,\" or the calm quarter. MELOV\u00c6R, a cluster of islets and rocks about 2 miles in width and 3 miles in length, off the western end of MelS, is with reason considered one of the most dangerous places in the Inner Lead ; the tides are very strong and run in different directions through the numerous narrow sounds between the islets ; the wind also is frequently variable and baffling under the high land of MelS. To avoid passing through MelSv\u00e6r the coasting steam vessels take the passage between the east point of MelS and Sjerpa, which through narrow and winding, is free from dangers, proceeding either southward or eastward of Gaasv\u00e6r to the main channel. The best passage for vessels, whose draught does not exceed 12 feet, is that to the westward of MelSv\u00e6r, where there is room for beating to windward."], [327, "CHAP, xiii.] SELSOSUND \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 309 Beacons. \u2014 The following islets and rocks are marked as specified : \u2014 MelSv\u00e6rkua, the southern islet of MelSv\u00e6r \u2014 conical stone beacon, yellow.

DIRECTIONS and ANCHORAGE\u2014 After passing west- ward of Omn\u00e6sS, the beacon on MelSv\u00e6rkua will be sighted, and course may be altered for Glommen fiord and the passage between MelS and Sjerpa ; with the exception of a rock about 4 cables southward of the south-west point of MelS this channel is perfectly clear, and temporary anchorage may be found between the eastern islets of Gaasv\u00e6r. If intending to pass through MelSv\u00e6r, steer direct for MelSv\u00e6rkua, and pass about 2 cables eastward of it. The general depth in MelSv\u00e6r is 4 to 5 fathoms, and if the wind is light or the tide adverse, vessels may bring up as soon as the south beacon is passed. When proceeding to the north ward from MelSv\u00e6rkua, keep in mid-channel until the north point of Oterv\u00e6rS is abeam, when the nearest holm to the eastward will be Latein \u25a0 there is anchorage on the east side of this holm in 4 to 5 fathoms, over sand. Keep close to the west side of Latein in order to avoid the shoal to the westward ; pass close under the high grass-covered islet to the north' ward, give the next rock to be passed a fair berth, and proceed in mid channel between Olstokv\u00e6r and North MelSv\u00e6r. The entrance to the passage westward of Melov\u00e6r is between Bolgen aud MelSv\u00e6rkua ; give the south-west point of Oterv\u00e6rS a berth of about 3 cables, to clear a sunken rock ; pass westward of the next holm to the northward, and proceed between the western islet of Olstokv\u00e6r (from which a shoal extends about one cable to the north-westward), and the two small flat rocks to the westward, which are always visible. An anchor might be dropped during a calm in almost any part of this passage. To enter from the northward, pass 2 or 3 cables westward of the north MelSv\u00e6r beacon ;. continue along the north side of Olstokv\u00e6r, at a distance of one or 2 cables from the shore, and proceed eastward of the two small rocks mentioned above^ MELOV\u00c6R to FLEINA.\u2014 After leaving North MelSv\u00e6r beacon, care must be taken to avoid a rock lying 4 cables eastward of Sandv\u00e6r. The three bare rocky islets lyiag 1\\ miles northward of MelSv\u00e6r may be passed on either side at a distance cf one or 2 cables. Shoals extend"], [328, "310 DONN\u00c6SO TO FLEINA. [chap. xiii. about three-quarters of a mile westward from Gaasv\u00e6r, but they are visible at low water. Vessels may proceed to the northward either through Stableleden, StStsund, or the channel between StSt HusS and Kunna. Stableleden (the Stable channel), which leads westward of StStv\u00e6r, Fleinv\u00e6r, and Blixv\u00e6r, and eastward of T\u00e6nholm and Giv\u00e6r is the best passage for sailing vessels in fine weather, but between T\u00e6nholm and Giv\u00e6r it is fully exposed to seaward. At low water StStsund is only practicable for vessels drawing less than 10 feet. The channel between StSt HusS and Kunna is seldom used by sailing vessels, owing to the probability of being becalmed under Kunna, but it is, perhaps, the best for steam vessels, and with the exception of the rocks extending 2 or 3 cables from the north-east side of StSt HusS, is free from dangers. From Kunna, vessels may pass on either side of North Bredgruud (a 4-fathom patch lying 8 or 9 cables W.N.W. from StStkuv) to Stableleden, or they may proceed northward through the channel eastward of FuglS. STABLELEDEN.\u2014 Entering Stableleden from the southward it is best to pass between Kraaka and the islets westward of SSrstot, in order to avoid South Bredgruud, a reef carrying 5 fathoms, which lies nearly three-quarters of a mile westward of Kraaka. The highest part of RSd LSvenS, kept westward of Bolgen, will lead between the shoals off StStv\u00e6r and T\u00e6nholm, and westward of Ydstbo and Meebo, to the channels northward of Fleinv\u00e6r; but if bound to BodS, vessels may pass about 2 miles westward of the R\u00e6vskind group and Fuglev\u00e6r, and proceed through the channel between Fleinv\u00e6r and ArnS. After passing StStv\u00e6r vessels might haul to the eastward if considered advisable, and proceed southward of RSrbS, and northward or southward of Fl\u00e6sene, to the channel eastward of FuglS. There is also a good passage northward of North Bredgrund, StStkuv, and Fl\u00e6sene. RexSbaran, south-westward of the R\u00e6vskind islands, is marked by an iron pole ; and Sjursholm, in FuglSv\u00e6r, by a wooden beacon. If wishing to proceed westward of Fleinv\u00e6r, keep the highest part oi'RSd LSvenS open westward of Bolgen until past YdstbS. STOTSUND is very shallow, and the depth is yearly decreasing ; at low water there are barely 2 fathoms in the deepest part of the sound, and towards the north end there are not even 10 feet ; it is also narrow and intricate. Beacons. \u2014 SSrstSt, on the east side ofthe south entrance to StStsund, is marked by a yellow conical stone beacon ; Gjetryggen, by a cannon with staff and broom ; a rock off Svenningen by an iron pole, and Bonetskjer by a red stone beacon with a white belt.

Vessels may bring up in any part of StStsund, but the bottom, which consists of loose sand and shells, is untrustworthy holding ground. There is no obstruction in the northern part of StStsund, and when past Kunna, course may be altered for Stableleden or the channel eastward of FuglS. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light varied by a flash every two minutes, and visible at a distance of 13 miles when bearing from East through south aud west to N. \\ W., is shown at an elevation of 43 feet, from the tower of a yellow wooden building on the middle Seiskjer ; it is intended as a leading light for the northern entrance to StStsund, and is exhibited from the 15th bring up of August to the 30th of April. Directions. \u2014 Having passed Bredtarren, which will be cleared by keeping Seiskjer light to the westward of S.S.E. \\ E., pass northward of a rock which lies N.E. A N. 3 cables from the lighthouse ; then steer S. by W. A W., giving the rocks to the westward a berth of one or 2 cables, and south-westward of Bonetskjer in 8 to 9 fathoms. EASTWARD of PUGLO. \u2014 From Kunna vessels may proceed either northward or southward of Fl\u00e6sene, or Fuglesang, to the channel eastward of FuglS, where smoother water but less wind may be expected than in Stableleden. If the wind is N.N.W. outside the islands it will be about west under FuglS, and on closing Femris it will fall nearly calm with occasional puffs. The tidal streams are very strong in this channel, the flood setting northward and the ebb southward, and with westerly or north-west winds there is a strong indraught. The only directions that seem necessaiy for this channel are that vessels should keep nearest the mainland when passing between Fleina and VeS, continuing between Sandhornet and ArnS, whence a N.E. A N. course made good for about 7 miles will lead past Salten fiord to Svartoxen off the entrance to BodS. Anchorage. \u2014 The anchorage between Femris and RusS has a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms, and may be entered either from the eastward or west ward. There is a stone beacon on the west side of Femrissund. In Hustadsund, between VeS and Sandhornet, there is anchorage in 3 to 5 fathoms over sand, but it should only be used in summer."], [330, "312 CHAPTER XIV. FLEINA to VEST VAAGO. Variation in 1880. 14\u00b0 10' W. West Lofoten Vest Fiord - J South Entrance - 13\u00b0 20' W. \" I North Entrance - 12\u00b0 20' W. GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 The district of Salten comprises that part of Nordland which lies between Kunna and Ofoten fiord ; it is intersected by several deep fiords, which penetrate far inland, and is per haps the most desolate part of Norway, even firewood is scarce in many places, the pasture lands are few and small, the cattle diminutive, and cultivation is virtually limited to Saltialen and a low tract between the Salten and Folden fiords, where barley and potatoes are grown ; tlic population is scanty, and depends chiefly on the fisheries for subsistence. The Lofoten islands, which constitute the district of Lofoten, are sepa rated from the coast of Salten by the great open space or channel named Vest fiord, which is about 100 miles long, and from 40 to 50 miles broad at its southern extremity, narrowing gradually thence in a north-easterly direction to a mere strait. The Lofotens are a rocky chain of island mountains, with such sharply defined summits that they have been aptly compared to a row of shark's teeth ; the eastern peaks average 2,000 feet iu height, Vaagekallen on East Vaago attaining an elevation of 3,300 feet. The tortuous passages between the islands are extremely narrow, and the tidal streams rush through them with great violence, forming strong whirls and eddies, a fact to which the MalstrSm owes its fictitious celebrity ; these channels or tide ways are termed strSms. The mountains, where not too precipitous, are covered iu summer with a vigorous growth of grass, which supports a few diminutive cattle and sheep. The resident population of this group is about 4,000, but during the fishing season, (January, February, and March), the islands are visited by 4,000 or 5,000 boats, each with a crew of four or five men, who come from the neighbouring Amts, provided with provisions and tackle for the season. The coast of Salten consists of numerous straggling peninsulas, trending generally in a north-easterly direction, and is fronted by a \" skjergaard \" which extends from 10 to 15 miles seaward between Fleina and Folden * See Admiralty chart: \u2014 Norway, sheet ix., Fleina to VestFiord and Lofoten islands, ;Q. 2,311."], [331, "CHAP. XIV.] 313 REMARKS \u2014 TIDES . fiord, and gradually decreases in breadth from thence to the northward, disappearing almost entirely towards the inner end of Vest fiord. In this \" skjergaard \" the islands Landegode and EngelsS are important landmarks, on account of their size and configuration. The principal fiords on this part of the coast are Salten fiord, southward of BodS ; Folden fiord, northward of Landegode ; Sag fiord, eastward of EngelsS ; and Tys fiord and Ofoten fiord, at the north-east end of Vest fiord ; Ofoten fiord, which extends 45 miles inland on the south side of the boundary between the Amts of Nordland and TromsS, is in fact a continuation of Vest fiord. All these inlets are distinguished in places by imposing mountain scenery, and some of their tributary rivers are of con siderable size. There is a beautiful and well wooded valley at the inner end of Sag fiord, and Lapp settlements may be seen in Tys fiord. RSsvik in South Folden fiord, and Fagern\u00e6s in Beids fiord, near the inner end of Ofoten fiord, are stations from which several interesting excursions may be made. TIDES AND CURRENT.\u2014 Northward of the Arctic Circle the tidal streams run with greater velocity than on any other part of the coast of Norway, and where rapid streams are compressed within narrow channels whirlpools are formed, which are sometimes sufficiently strong to turn any vessel round, and to necessitate very careful steerage. These whirlpools are cavities in the form of an inverted bell, wide and rounded at the mouth, and narrower towards the bottom ; they are largest when first formed, and are carried along with the stream, diminishing gradually until they disappear ; before the extinction of one, two or three more will appear, following each other like so many pits in the sea ; the suction or spiral motion communicated to the water does not seem to extend very fat beyond the cavities. Fishermen affirm that if they are aware of their approach towards a whirlpool, and have time to throw an oar or any other bulky body into it, they will get over safely ; the reason is, that when the continuity of the surface is broken, and the vertiginous motion of the sea interrupted by something thrown into it, the water must rush suddenly in on all sides and fill up the cavity. For the same reason, in blowing weather, or when the waves break, though there may be a whirling round there can be no cavity. In the SaltstrSm (page 319), boats and men have been drawn down by these vortices, and much loss of life has resulted. When danger of this kind is imminent, the crew should endeavour to get under the thwarts and cling to them, for when a boat has been sucked under, it is invariably cast up again, frequently several times in succession, and generally whole and uninjured, so that those who have sufficient strength and presence of mind to keep their hold will rise with it, while the encased air will prevent their being drowned."], [332, "314 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xrv. Between Tr\u00e6nen and Vest fiord, the current is irregular, and dependent on the winds, but has a general tendency to set northward past the west side of RSst. In the whole of Vest fiord the motions of the tidal streams are materially influenced by the winds. Sometimes, when there is little or no current in mid-channel, there is a regular ebb and flood along the land on either side, the streams invariably setting in contrary directions on the opposite sides of the fiord. The flood sets in to the north-eastward, and the ebb runs out to the south-westward, either along the mainland or the south-east coast of Lofoten, but when, or on which coast, the streams will make, is uncertain, and frequently depends on the wind. FLEINA TO HELLIGV\u00c6R. Before describing Vest fiord and the Lofotens it will be convenient to complete the description of the coast as far northward as Helligv\u00e6r, which lies about 15 miles northward of Fleina and Sandhornet, and may be con sidered the northern termination of the great \" skjergaard \" between FrS Havet and Vest fiord. Between Fleina and Helligv\u00e6r are the fishing stations Fleinv\u00e6r, Blixv\u00e6r, and Giv\u00e6r, and within these islands are the entrances to BodS and Salten fiord. FuglS, Sandhornet, and the lofty island Landegode, in the summit of which there is a hollow running about N. by E. and S. by W., are excellent landmarks for this part of the coast. FLEINV\u00c6R. \u2014 Skibshavn, in the southern part of Fleinv\u00e6r, a cluster of low islands northward of Fleina, is the southern harbour of any importance in that part of the \" skjergaard \" northward of Tr\u00e6nen ; the anchorage, surrounded by small holms and rocks, has a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms over loose sand, and two moorings rings for shore hawsers. There is also a good harbour for small craft, with the same depth and bottom, in the northern part of Fleinv\u00e6r. Skibshavn may be entered or left with any wind, as there are four entrances ; these are very difficult, and cannot be taken without the assistance of a pilot, which service, however, every inhabitant ofthe group is able to render. Beacons. \u2014 The south and north-east entrances to Fleinv\u00e6r are marked by wooden beacons, consisting of three uprights with a horizontal cross piece ; the entrance to the northern harbour is marked by a red tri angular beacon ; and Varholmgrund carries au iron pole.

Arno Havn, about 3 miles eastward of Fleinv\u00e6r, is a good and safe but small harbour, with mooring rings, and a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms over loose sand. There is a 7-fathom patch off the south entrance, which may be avoided by keeping close to the shore on either side of the bay when entering. In passing through either of the northern entrances it is neces sary to keep very close to the land to the eastward. In the northern anchorage there are mooring rings in a small rock. The position of Arno Havn is marked by a yellow conical beacon. BLIXV\u00c6R- \u2014 The islands between Fleina and Landegode are termed volleetively Blixv\u00e6r, but include the small clusters Kj\u00e6rv\u00e6r, Terra, and Stensv\u00e6r ; the three latter groups are uninhabited, and afford no anchor age ; but on the south-east side of the large island Blixv\u00e6r, about 5 miles north-eastward of Fleinv\u00e6r, there are several harbours suitable for vessels of any class. The western harbour, between the south side of Blixv\u00e6r and the islet to the southward, has a depth of 10 to 12 fathoms over a good sandy bottom ; it is convenient for southward bound vessels, but has no mooring rings. The north-eastern harbour is very useful for vessels taking the Inner Lead, and meeting with foul winds off the entrance to Salten fiord. The best position is just southward of the warehouses, in 4 to 6 fathoms over sand, with a shore hawser made fast to the ring in the rock. With southerly winds the entrance southward of Einarholm is the best ; with northerly or easterly winds vessels may either pass southward of GrSnholm or between Stensv\u00e6r and Flesene. The north-east entrance to the harbour is marked with beacons, but they stand so low that it is diffi cult to distinguish them. The entrances to Blixv\u00e6r will be best under stood by reference to the chart. Giv\u00e6r and Giv\u00e6r-T\u00e6nholniS. \u2014 About 5 miles north-westward of Blixv\u00e6r is the group Giv\u00e6r, and 2 miles farther west, on the outer edge ofthe \"'Skjergaard,\" are the Giv\u00e6r-T\u00e6nholms (T\u00e6n islets). Thereisavery small and indifferent harbour in Giv\u00e6r, but as the group is inhabited a pilot might be obtained there. Vessels bound to or from Stableleden may either pass westward of the Giv\u00e6r-T\u00e6nholms, or eastward of Giv\u00e6r ; but if the wind is light, time will be saved by passing between these groups, taking care to avoid the Outer Mesyen shoal. Mesyen Shoals. \u2014 Indre or Inner Mesyen, which carries from 2 to 8 fathoms, lies about half-way between Giv\u00e6r and Blixv\u00e6r. Ydre or Outer Mesyen, on which there are only 2 fathoms, lies three-quarters of a mile eastward of the eastern Giv\u00e6r-T\u00e6nholm rocks."], [334, "316 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. Sdrboen Shoals extend 1\u00a3 miles southward from the western Giv\u00e6r- T\u00e6nholms. The southern islets of Giv\u00e6r, in line with the highest part of Landegode, will lead southward of these dangers. Giv\u00e6r-T\u00e6nholm beacon. \u2014 The south-western Giv\u00e6r- Tenholm is distinguished by a black and white woodeii beacon, consisting of two uprights with a horizontal cross piece. HELLIGV/ER, about 6 miles northward of Blixv\u00e6r, is much re sorted to by vessels engaged in the Lofoten fishery ; there is a sound right through the group, with good anchorage in almost every part of it, but the northern harbour is considered the best in winter. Pilots are stationed at Helligv\u00e6r. LIGHTS. \u2014 'she two following lights are exhibited from the 15th of August to the 30th of April ; they serve to mark the entrances to Helligv\u00e6r, and may also be useful to vessels entering or leaving Vest fiord. GrytO or South Helligv\u00e6r. \u2014 On the south-east part of GrytS (an islet on the west side of the south entrance to Helligv\u00e6r), stands a light house 36 feet high, from which is exhibited a fixed white light, elevated 102 feet, and visible 13 miles. VaagO or North Helligv\u00e6r. \u2014 A fixed red light, elevated 43 feet, and visible 7 miles when bearing from S.S.E. \\ E., through south to N.W. A N., is exhibited from the north-east point of VaagS, on the west side of the north entrance to Helligv\u00e6r. Rock. \u2014 A sunken rock lies about 40 yards N.E. A E. from the lighthouse. Beacon. \u2014 The islet on the east side of the north entrance to Helligv\u00e6r is marked by a stone beacon. Kjengboen, which lies N. by E. A^E. nearly 3 miles from VaagS light house, carries one fathom, and is neatly always marked by breakers. The northernmost visible point of Landegode, bearing southward of S.E. A E., leads northward of Kjengboen. Directions. \u2014 The southern entrance to Helligv\u00e6r, which is about a quarter of a mile south-eastward of GrytS, is rather difficult to make out, as the beacons are hidden by the high land. SSrv\u00e6rgalten is marked by an iron pillar. Entering from the northward, steer for the highest hill top on the north-east part of Helligv\u00e6r, keeping VaagS lighthouse or the north Helligv\u00e6r beacon to the eastward of S. \\ W., until past the western rock of Lyngv\u00e6r ; continue along the east side of VaagS, and bring up either in the sound, in from 7 to 10 fathoms over au uneven clay bottom, or between the holms to the eastward in 13 to 15 fathoms. There is also an entrance to the northern harbour from the eastward, but it is extremely narrow, and cannot be taken without a pilot. In the middle of the sound between the north and south anchorages there is a rock which covers at high water."], [335, "CHAP. XIV.] HELLIGV\u00c6R \u2014 BODO. 317 Lyngv\u00e6r. \u2014 The small harbour on the south part of Lyngv\u00e6r, about a mile eastward of Helligv\u00e6r, is only used by coasters and fishing vessels. BODO (Nordland's By), is the chief and only town iu Nordland ; it is finely situated on the south side of a bay about 8 miles eastward of Blixv\u00e6r, near the south-western extremity of the peninsula on the north side of Salten fiord. The productive herring fisheries in the neighbourhood have materially tended to further the prosperity of the town, and it has now a population of about 1,100.* When the Lofoten fishery is at its height the harbour is crowded with vessels, and as south-westerly gales send in rather a heavy sea, it is proposed to construct a breakwater. In the western part of the bay there are 6 to 9 fathoms over clay, but the inner end is shoal. Nyholm Sund, westward of Nyholm, has the same depth and bottom, and is more sheltered, but it is necessary to moor with hawsers made fast to the rings, as the sound is narrow and the tidal streams are strong. Small vessels may pass between the east end of HjertS and the mainland at high water, but the passage is very shoal. Temporary anchorage may be found in Skibsholm Sund, on the north-west side of HjertS, but south-west and north-east winds send in a heavy swell. Pilots and supplies. \u2014 Government pilots are stationed at BodS. Provisions and coal may be obtained, and there is a spring of good water at the inner end of the bay. On the north side of the harbour is a place where vessels of moderate size are beached for repairs, and on the east end of Nyholm is a coal store, with staging for vessels to haul alongside. LIGHT. \u2014 From the east end of Nyholm, in the entrance to Bodo har bour, a fixed red and white light, elevated 57 feet, and visible 8 miles, is exhibited from the loth of August to the 30th of April. In the western entrance the light is white from N.E. by E. f E. to E. a S., and red from E. A S. to E | N., when it is hidden by HjertS. In the northern entrance it is white between HjertS and the mainland, or between the bearings S. by W. \\ W., and S.S.W. \\ W., and shows white towards the anchorage. Beacons and Dangers. \u2014 In the approaches to BodS are the follow ing beacons and dangers : \u2014 Svartoxen, a round black rock about W.N.W. 1\\ miles from Hern\u00e6s Skaeen or Skagodden, the south-western extreme of the peninsula north of Saltern fiord, is the westernmost rock off the entrance to BodS, and is distinguished by a yellow stone beacon. Kirkgrund, on which there are only 6 feet, lies S.W. a S. 3 cables from Svartoxen. * Near Bodo I observed erratic blocks of highly crystallized syenite, white granite, aud quartzose porphyry. The prevailing rock of the country is mica slate.\u2014 Professor Forbes-"], [336, "318 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. A rock, carrying 3 fathoms lies three-quarters of a mile westward of the south extreme of Skagodden, and KavanS, an islet off the same point, is marked by a yellow stone beacon. KvitrSrskallen, off Hern\u00e6sland, is marked by an iron pillar ; and there are iron poles on Rundolmgrund and Nyholmgrund. The whole of Her n\u00e6sland, between Skagoddeu and BodS, is shoal for about a cable off shore. About 1J miles north-eastward of the north point of Landegode is a reef extending half a mile W.N.W. and E.S.E. ; its position is generally indicated by breakers. Lobsholm, a small islet lying N.N.E. E., 3 miles from Nyholm light house, is marked by a stone beacon ; a shoal extends nearly 2 cables from the south and west sides of LSbsholm. Toftbo, a sunken rock on the east side of the north entrance to BodS, lies 3 cables from the mainland and about one mile east of the north point of HjertS. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels bound to BodS from the southward should endeavour to make Tr\u00e6nen and from a position 10 miles N.W. of Tr\u00e6nstaven steer N.E. by E. i E. for about 50 miles, giving all visible rocks to the eastward a berth of 3 or 4 miles ; they will then make the Giv\u00e6r T\u00e6nholm s, and may close Fleinv\u00e6r for a pilot, taking care to avoid the SSrbo shoals, Ystbo, and Meebo. The best channel to run for, if there is no pilot on board, is that between Fleinv\u00e6r and ArnS, which is clear close up to the visible rocks on either side. Sandhornet in line with the summit of Fleina, bearing E. by S. | S., will lead in southward of Ystbo and Meebo ; and when Nupen, the southermost islet of Fleinv\u00e6r, bears N.E., and E. by N. |N. course for about 8 miles will lead clear through the passage. From about a mile north of ArnS, steer direct for HjertS on a N.E. by E i E. bearing, until within a mile of Svartoxen ; pass west ward and northward of that rock, taking care to avoid Kirkgrund, and proceed for BodS harbour. Svartbarren (about half-way between Svar toxen. and HjertS), and Rundholm (a small round islet off the entrance to the harbour) may be passed on either side, and the south side of Nyholm is clean close-to. There is also a passage through RSsSsund, between KvanS and RSsS, but it is not advisable to use it without some local know- ledge. When standing in from seaward between Fleinv\u00e6r and Blixv\u00e6r, the northern islets of Fleinv\u00e6r must be given a berth of 2 miles in order to avoid RSdgrundene, and the southern part of Kj\u00e6rv\u00e6r should not be approached nearer than one mile. At night. \u2014 After passing northward of Svartoxen, vessels entering BodS harbour from the westward at night, should keep on the southern edge of the red fight, which will lead southward of Svartbarren and"], [337, "319 CHAP. XIV.] BODO \u2014 SALTEN FIORD. Eholm. In passing through RSsSsund keep on the southern edge of the white light, taking care not to stand so far to the northward that the light is hidden by RSsS, and no farther to the southward when it begins to show faint. Northern entrance. \u2014 If bound to BodS from Vest fiord, keep the north extreme of Landegode southward of S.E. \\ E., until past Kjengboen ; pass on either side of the reef north-eastward of Landegode, and proceed between Bringholm and the islets off Kvi for Nyholmsund, passing on either side of LSbsholm. There is also a passage southward of Helligv\u00e6r and Landegode, bnt as there are several rocks between the south side of the latter island and Stensv\u00e6r, it is not a good entrance for strangers. Caution is necessary when navigating the space between BodS and Landegode, especially in winter, on account of the violent squalls to which it is exposed. Easterly winds are the most dangerous, as they blow with fierce and frequent gusts off the land ; north-west and W.N.W. winds are also very unsteady, with heavy squalls off the high peaks of Landegode. Anchorage. \u2014 Landegode has three harbours which might be useful to vessels entering BodS from the northward, but it is difficult to make them without a pilot, and the entrances are very narrow. Kjelbotten, on the north-east side of the island, has a depth of 4 to 5 fathoms over sand, and vessels may bring up in the entrance to the harbour in 16 fathoms. Kvi, nearly 2 miles southward of Kjelbotten, has the same depth and bottom. F\u00e6vaag, northward of F\u00e6n\u00e6s, is a small but snug harbour with 4 to 5 fathoms, sandy bottom. SALTEN FIORD. \u2014 About 10 miles eastward of Fleina is the entrance to Salten fiord, which, with its continuations, the Skjerstad and Saltdals fiords, penetrates about 40 miles inland. Violent storms and strong currents are experienced in the outer part of Salten fiord, and south-westerly gales send in a heavy sea. lt generally happens, especially in winter, that when a stiff breeze is blowing right out of Salten fiord it is calm, or the wind is southerly beyond Fleinv\u00e6r. Salten and Skjerstad fiords are connected by a narrow sound between StrSmS and GodS, through which runs the SaltstrSm ; GodSstrSm, between the east end of GodS (KnaplundS) and the mainland, is navigable for boats, but only at certain times. Skjerstad fiord has several small branches, amongst which Nordvik botten and Valn\u00e6s fiord, are noted for their rich deposits of iron ore. Saltdalen, a fertile valley consisting of a series of terraces, well dotted with farms, is watered by the Saltdalselv, which flows into Saltdals fiord at Salt\u00e6s, and is navigable for boats as far as Storjord farm. Saltstrdm or Saltens Malstrom is one of the most remarkable natural phenomena in Norway. Skjerstad fiord is a huge land-locked basin, which is partly filled and emptied by the tides twice a day ; the"], [338, "320 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap, xiv body of water consequently forced through the comparatively narrow sound between StrSmS and GodS in so short a time is enormous. At full aud change, and when the snows begin to melt in spring, there is sometimes a difference of more than 4 feet between the surface levels of the outer and inner fiords towards high and low water, and the violence of the stream is then so great that the houses near it tremble, and whales have been driven back when trying to force a passage through. Even in fine weather the noise of the stream may be heard at a considerable distance ; and it is only navigable during the short intervals of slack water, when vessels may pass between the west side of GodS and the low holm which lies nearly in the middle of the sound. Beiern fiord. \u2014 At the west end of StrSmS is the entrance to Beiern fiord, which extends about 16 miles inland to the fine river and valley of Beierdal, and separates the island of Sandhorn from the mainland. The scenery on the inner part of this fiord is magnificent. In winter a canal is cut through the ice to admit the local steam vessel from BodS. LOFOTEN AND VEST FIORD. The principal islands on the north-west side of Vest fiord are RSst, V\u00e6rS, Mosken\u00e6so, FlagstadS, Vest, or West VaagS, Ost or East VaagS, and HindS. Vessels bound to TromsS from the southward may either pass westward of RSst and the Lofotens to the entrances north of Anden\u00e6s, or they may proceed through Vest fiord to Tiel Sund. Having once entered Vest fiord it would be imprudent to attempt putting to sea again through any of the channels or strSms between the Lofoten islands, and it is un advisable to attempt either of the channels between RSst and Lofotodden { Lofoten point), except in fine weather or cases of emergency. PILOTS. \u2014 It must be borne in mind that the Lofoten pilots never use the words \"styrbord\" (starboard) and \"bagbord\" (port) like those on other parts of the coast, but say instead \" Hold ikke mer ud !\" \" ikke mer ind!\"(keep no farther out ! no farther in !), both of which expressions refer to the mainland, not to the coast of Lofoten. LANDMARKS. \u2014 When approaching Vest fiord from the south westward, in clear weather, Tr\u00e6nen and RSst will probably be sighted before the mountains on the mainland are visible ; but frequently a sea mist envelopes these islands, while the great snowfield of Fondalen and some of the high mountains to the southward may be seen dis tinctly. Northward of Fondalen, Kunna will appear quite isolated, with a rounded summit. Sandhornet will be conspicuous farther to the northward, and between that and the mountain on Landegode, only two blocks ot high land show above the horizon. RSst, V\u00e6rS, Mosken, and Helseggen or Lofotodden (the southern point of Lofoten), are easily recognised."], [339, "321 CHAP. XIV.] LOFOTEN ISLANDS. ROST is the south-western most group of islands on the west side of Vest fiord. RSstS or Hjemlandet is a flat and very low island from l\u00a3 to 2 miles in diameter ; it is surrounded by a great number of islets and rocks, none of which are visible beyond a distance of 8 or 10 miles. Southward of RSstS are the precipitous islands VedS and StorS ; Vedo is 780 feet high, and Storf jeld on StorS attains an elevation of 900 feet. StavS, on the east side of RSstS, rises to a height of 400 or 500 feet. These three islands are excellent landmarks, and in clear weather may be seen from a distance of more than 30 miles. When within 15 or 20 miles of Rost, the high sharp peaks of Ellevsnyk, Trenyk, and Hernyk will be visible south ward of Storfjeld ; the peculiar configuration of these islets renders them unmistakable, especially if seen when bearing E.S.E., from whence they show clear of each other. From a position northward or north-westward of RSst, V\u00e6rS, Mosken, and Lofotodden will also be visible. When seen from a distance V\u00e6rS will appear like a low ridge with small sharp peaks, and abrupt declivities to the north and south. The small island Mosken will show two peaks, and land will be visible to the northward as far as Fuglehuk, the north-western point of Mosken\u00e6so. RSst has several good harbours, but they can only be entered from the southward and eastward ; the north and west sides of the group are in accessible, consequently no shelter can be found from westerly or north westerly gales, but if the wind is south-westerly a vessel may run for Guldholmhavn at VedS. Pilots. \u2014 Although RSstS is inhabited, pilots can hardly be expected to come out eveu in fine weather and still less in foul. DANGERS OFF ROST. \u2014 An uneven sandbank, sufficiently shoal in some places to break in heavy weather, extends several miles southward and south-westward from RSst ; in consequence of this, and the extraordinary strength of the tidal streams, the southern islets of the group should not be approached nearer than 15 miles, unless the wind is northerly, when to prevent losing ground, a vessel might pass about three-quarters of a mile southward of the southernmost visible rocks, and northward of Notskallen and Sejskallen. The west side of RSst should be given a berth of at least 5 miles, to avoid the danger of being driven amongst the rocks by the tides if the wind should fail. Fl\u00e6s-skallerne are the northernmost heads on the uneven stony ground which extends about 4 miles northward and north-eastward from RSstS ; as there are 14 to 15 fathoms on the shoalest of these rocks, they only break when the sea is very heavy, but it is better to pass northward of them on account of the violence of the tidal streams in their vicinity. The south east point of V\u00e6rS, near the harbour, entirely hidden by Maahorn or K 740. x"], [340, "322 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. XIV Maaholm, bearing E. | S., will lead northward of Fl\u00e6s-skallerne, aud a vessel will be abreast of them when the eastern peak on Trenyk is visible between Storfjeld and VedS. Rocks above and below water extend 2 miles south-eastward from StavS, on the east side of RSstS, but their position is generally indicated by breakers. Mosken, or the south peak on Lofotodden, kept in sight to the eastward of the northern hill on V\u00e6rS, will lead eastward of all the dangers off the east side of RSst ; but if Mosken can be seen over the western slope of V\u00e6rS, the vessel will be running straight on to the rocks. Anchorage. \u2014 On the east side of RSstS there is good anchorage between Bryggen and Grav, and also at Lyngv\u00e6r, about a mile farther south. The entrances to these harbours are long and very difficult, and can only be taken with the aid of a pilot. Stangholm is marked by a stone beacon. Guldholmhavn, on the east side of VedS, is of much more im portance, as it might be entered without a pilot, but only with a southerly wind. If there is a strong westerly or south-westerly wind at sea, it will be scanty and irregular near Vedo, with sudden squalls. When approaching VedS from the southward, vessels must pass at least half a mile eastward of Fiskfl\u00e6sa, which lies S. by W. \u00a3 W. 3 miles from VedS, and E.N.E. 2 miles from the Odskjers ; at high water only two black naked rocks are visible, but at low water several more will be seen to the southward. It is almost impossible to mistake Fiskfl\u00e6sa, as it lies nearly 2 miles from the nearest islets, and is the only isolated rock in the whole of RSst. A sunken rock lies S. by W. W. IA miles from Fiskfl\u00e6sa, and E. by S.^ S. 1\u00a7 miles from the Eastern Odskjer ; the whole of the space to the westward and northward of this rock and Fiskfl\u00e6sa is shallow and foul. The highest part of VedS kept between N. \\ W. and N.N.W. will lead between the shoals on either side of the entrance to Guldholmhavn. On nearing the island, a smaller rounded hill will be seen under the highest part of VedS, and a vessel must stand no farther to the westward than to have those two in line ; several small rocks will also be seen off RSstholm, a high islet with a gradual slope to the southward and a steep fall to the north ; these must be given a good berth. After passing between RSstholm and Leiskj\u00e6r, which lies about 3 cables to the eastward, continue between the east side of VedS and the Tinholms, and bring up in 7 fathoms, when a low holm lying in a small bight to the northward is sighted ; small craft may run farther in, and bring up off the holm in I1; to 2 fathoms. There is a passage from VedS to the harbours farther north, but a pilot must be obtained from RSstS before it can be used. V\u00c6RO is as dangerous of approach as RSst, rocks and shoals encom passing it on all sides."], [341, "323 CHAP. XIV.] LOFOTEN ISLANDS \u2014 MALSTROM. The rocks off Maahorn, the south-western extreme of V\u00e6rS, are especially dangerous, as they extend nearly 2 miles to the southward, and with the exception of Kallen, which is only visible at low water, are always covered ; with a scant wind, strangers would be very likely to run straight on these rocks after passing northward of those off RSst. A vessel will be westward of the dangers off Maahorn as long as an opening can be seen between VedS and StorS. Stavo, in line with the north side of VedS, will lead southward and eastward. The whole north-west side of V\u00e6rS is unapproachable aud uninhabited* From Brunksallen, which lies 3-t miles from the south-western part of V\u00e6rS, the outer edge of the dangerous rocky ground surrounding that island and Mosken extends in a north-easterly direction to the Hogholms. Yttertuven, a hillock forming the south-eastern extreme of Lofotodden, kept eastward of E. by N. A N., will lead westward of these dangers, but as the east-going stream sets very strongly towards them, they should be given a wide berth. Immediately outside the bank there are 60 fathoms, and a short distance beyond that 120 fathoms. Anchorage.\u2014 Vaagen, or Rosn\u00e6svaagen, on the south-east side of V\u00e6rS, has a depth of 2 to 4 fathoms, over sand, off the houses, and rather deeper water farther iu. Kvitvarden (the white beacon) a round rocky hillock at the extreme end of the point on the east side of the entrance, is distinguished by its peculiar whiteness. Having once made out Kvitvarden the entrance is not difficult, but it is too narrow for working either in or out, and all the rocks and points must be given a fair berth. Lighthouse. \u2014 A lighthouse is in course of construction on the east entrance point of Vaagen. Anchorage. \u2014 Amongst the Hundholms, about 1J miles northward of Kvitvarden, there is a small summer harbour with a depth of 3 fathoms over sand ; the entrances are narrow and intricate. Tides. \u2014 In consequence of the narrow sounds through which a con siderable 'volume of water has to pass in and out of Vest fiord and the inlets of Salten. the tidal streams run generally with greater velocity at Lofoten than on other parts of the coast. A thorough knowledge of the tides is indispensable to the safe navigation of either of the channels between RSst and Lofotodden ; the prevailing weather must also be taken into serious consideration before attempting them. MALSTROM Or MOSKENSTROM\u2014 Though rumour has greatly exaggerated the importance of the Malstrom, or more properly MoskenstrSm, which runs betweeu Mosken and Lofotodden, it is still the most dangerous tideway in Lofoten, its violence being due in great measure to the irregularity of the ground, which rises rapidly from the westward towards the east end of the strait, while on the south sido the streams are x 2"], [342, "324 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [CHAP. XIV. obstructed by the bank northward of V\u00e6rS. The stream attains its greatest velocity, which may be estimated at about 6 knots an hour, during westerly gales in winter. Its direction depends very much on the wind and weather ; with a westerly gale at sea it often runs continuously to the eastward during both flood and ebb, either slackening or perhaps remaining quiescent for a short time at high and low water, but soon acquiring fresh strength and resuming its easterly course. If the sea should be getting up, and the tide rising at the same time, the rush of water is considerable, and the channel quite unnavigable. In winter it often happens that a westerly gale at sea will send a heavy swell in towards the coast, while there is clear weather over the land, and a steady easterly wind blowing out of Vest fiord ; at these times the surges swell to an extraordinary height, and rage and break with great violence over the whole space between Lofotodden and the HSgholms, as the strength of the tide increases the sea becomes heavier, and the currents more irregular, forming extensive eddies or whirlpools (MalstrSm). During such periods no vessel should enter the Moskenstrom, neither is it advisable to attempt the passage with light variable winds in summer ; but with a steady breeze, after several days fine weather, there is no danger at all in taking it. It is imprudent to try and force a passage either in or out if the tide is adverse. The MoskenstrSm runs strongest between Hel and the HSgholms, where the passage is narrowest, and its velocity is much greater on the north side of the channel than near the islets ; in several places it sets right in towards Lofotodden, in consequence of its meeting with the counter-tide,* which runs along the shore with a velocity often equal to that of the main stream, but in a contrary direction. Horgan, which lies S. W. 1 A miles from Yttertuven, with the largest of the HSgholms bearing W.S.W., is the only shoal in the MoskenstrSm ; it carries 7 to 8 fathoms, and even in calm weather, when the sea does not break, the water over it bubbles and appears to boil, leaving a white scum on the surface, owing to the stream being interrupted in its course and forcibly reflected upwards. To avoid Horgan, vessels have only to keep over towards the north or south side of the channel ; the north side is preferable, but neither Lofotodden or the HSgholms should be approached nearer than half a mile. Hel. \u2014 If caught in the MoskenstrSm, and obliged to seek shelter, small vessels might run into the cove at Hel, but it is unadvisable to do so without a pilot. Off the entrance there are two rocks on which the sea always breaks ; after passing southward of these, care must be taken to keep in * Termed by the fishermen \" bagevje.\""], [343, "MALSTROM \u2014 -TIDAL STREAMS. 325 CHAP. XIF.] mid-channel when entering the bight, as there are shoals on either side, when so far in that the houses are visible, course may be altered for the anchorage, where there are 2 to 3 fathoms over sand. A shoal lies close north-eastward of the small souud which has to be passed when entering the cove. Only very small vessels should attempt this harbour, and it is only known to those living there. BETWEEN V\u00c6RO and ROST.\u2014 When the MoskenstrSm is impracticable, vessels entering or leaving Vest fiord must either pass north ward or southward of RSst, as the whole of the space between the HSgholms and V\u00e6rS is studded with rocks and shoals. The tideway between V\u00e6ro and RSst sometimes equals the MoskenstrSm in velocity, but as the channel is broader and the depth greater, (no bottom being found at 120 fathoms), the streams ruu more evenly and do not raise such a heavy topping sea; this, however, only applies to the open channel, for over and near the rocks on either side it is just as bad. Entering between RSst and V\u00e6rS from the westward, Maahom should be kept bearing E. A S. until the eastern peak on Trenyk is visible between Storfjeld and VedS, when a S.S.E. course will lead southward of the rocks off V\u00e6ro. If the stream sets strongly to the eastward, a vessel must pass 6 miles northward of RSst, aud when Storfjeld or VedS bears S.W., a course must be steered that will lead at least 4 miles southward of Maahorn. Entering from the eastward, keep StavS in line with the north side of VedS, about bearing W. f S., until the western extreme of V\u00e6rS is eastward of N.N.E., when a N.N.W. course will lead clear through the channel. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The average time of high water, full and change, at V\u00e6rS, is Oh. 31m. On the day of full moon the rise and fall is 9i feet, but on the day of new moon it is only 6 feet. At high water the ebb begins to run S.W. from Lofotodden, out through the MoskenstrSm, and past Va rS and RSst, gradually turning through west towards N.W. At half ebb, the MoskenstrSm runs straight out to sea, bending to the northward west of Refsvig ; but at V\u00e6rS and RSst the stream has by this time assumed a more northerly direction, running directly to the northward past the south and west sides of these islands. At three-quarters ebb the stream bends more to the eastward at V\u00e6rS and RSst, and its strength gradually decreases. At this period the Mos kenstrSm has slacked, and remains quiescent for about half an hour ; it then begins to run eastward into Vest fiord, and gradually acquires its full velocity. At low water, when the MoskenstrSm has already assumed its easterly course, the water remains stationary at RSst for about half an hour. As the water rises the flood stream begins to set N.E. by E. and E.N.E. from RSst towards V\u00e6rS, gradually increasing in strength, and veering through east to the southward of S.E, Towards high water it"], [344, "326 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. takes a S.S.W. and S.W. direction, gradually slacking until it is scarcely felt ; then, after another interval of half an hour the succeeding ebb begins to make as before. The MoskenstrSm therefore runs eastward with the flood and westward with the ebb, while the streams turn completely round RSst, with the sun, once in 12 hours, the flood varying its direction gradually from about N.E. through east towards S.W., from which point the ebb turns through west towards N. and N.E. This is the regular course of the tides in fine settled weather. In winter, when the weather is very unsettled with protracted and violent gales from the west and north-west, there is slack water at RSst during the time when the streams would otherwise run from about east through south to west, and the tide does not set perceptibly to the N.W. until the second hour of the ebb ; it then acquires extraordinary velocity, veering through north to the eastward of N.E., but gradually loses strength as its direction becomes easterly, until at half flood it slacks altogether. During the first and second quarters of the moon the eastern streams are twice as strong as those which run to the westward ; but during the third and fourth quarters these conditions are reversed, and the west-going streams are the strongest. WEST COAST Of LOFOTEN.\u2014 The whole of the outer or western coast of Lofoten, from Hel (on the west side of Lofotodden) to Hassel fiord (on the north side of East VaagS), is inaccessible, and should be avoided ; on the whole of this reach there are neither entrances or places of refuge, with the exception of Flagstadpollen, NapstrSm, Bor gev\u00e6r, and GimsS StrSm, the approaches to which are dangerous in the extreme. From Lofotodden to Fuglehuk the coast presents an unbroken range of precipices, without any landing place, and, with the exception ofRefsvig, without inhabitants. It is also fronted by a sand bank, with rocks and shoals extending from 2 to 5 miles off shore ; beyond this the depth in creases rapidly to upwards of 80 fathoms, until at a distance of 25 to 30 miles from the coast a depth of 50 to 80 fathoms is found on the Havbro. The principal landmarks are RSst, V\u00e6rS, and Mosken ; Skiven, near Bun\u00e6s, on the west side of Mosken\u00e6sS, Fuglehuk, and Napstind. Current. \u2014 The current sets continuously to the northward on the west side of Lofoten, independently of the tidal streams. Pilots and Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels making this part of the coast should not approach the west side of Mosken\u00e6sS nearer than to have Eggumsaxlen, on the north-west part of West VaagS, well visible outside Fuglehuk. If obliged to seek shelter, the only places where pilots can be expected are off Stokvig near Fuglehug, or off the entrance to NapstrSm,"], [345, "327 CHAP, xrv.] LOFOTEN \u2014 VEST FIORD. where fishermen might possibly be found ; the nearest shelter in such case would be either in the shallow bay of Flagstadpollen, where there is a ground swell in bad weather, or at Nap. Borgev\u00e6r, between Eggumsaxlen and Kvaln\u00e6saxlen, has a depth of 4 fathoms, and though the approaches are very dangerous the eastern en trance might be taken in fine weather without a pilot. Vessels should pass about half a mile westward of Kvaln\u00e6sfl\u00e6sene, in order to avoid a 3-fathom patch which lies W. by N. N. one mile from those rocks, and proceed between SandS and the reef lying 3 or 4 cables to the northward. The harbour is only used in summer, but there is a place near the houses where vessels might be laid up in winter. Borge fiord is only navigable for boats at high water, and southerly winds are generally squally and irregular near Eggumsaxlen. VEST FIORD.\u2014 Entering Vest fiord in thick or dark weather, the best landmarks to look out for are V\u00e6rS, Mosken, and Skraaven. The latter island lies about E. by N. 45 miles from Lofotodden ; it is 600 feet high, and its form is that of a right angled triangle resting on its longer side, with the shorter side facing the north. Between Lofotodden and Skraaven the coast of Lofoten falls back about 5 miles, and if the weather is sufficiently clear the openings of all the strSras or channels will be visible from a distance of 10 or 12 miles. Vaagekallen, on the south-west part of East VaagS, rises above the other islands in the form of a sugar-loaf, and the broad opening of GimsS StrSm will be seen to the westward. Urbierg on West VaagS, Lille Molla, or Grundstadbierg, north-eastward of Skraa ven and some parts of Vaagekallen also, are so precipitous that the snow cannot lie on them ; in winter, therefore, they stand out dark and distinct against the snow covered mountains behind them. It is better to keep on the Lofoten side of Vest fiord, when westward and southward of Skraaven, not only on account of the dangerous \" skjergaard \" off the mainland, but because many of the islands on that side are unin habited, and it is difficult to find anchorage, while the Lofoten coast offers good and secure harbours, and in thick weather the position of a vessel may in some measure be ascertained by sounding. Eastward of Skraaven, however, the dangers are all on the north side of the fiord, and it is neces sary to keep nearest the mainland. The various harbours and lights in Vest fiord, northward of those already described, will be found under the headings \" South-east coast of Lofoten \" and \" Inner Lead.\" SOUNDINGS. \u2014 On the east side of Vest fiord, southward of Skraa ven, the ground declines abruptly from the outer rocks off the mainland to a depth of 150 to 200 fathoms, it then rises gradually to the westward, until at a distance of 5 to 8 miles from Lofoten it forms a tolerably level bank, which carries a depth of 40 to 60 fathoms to within a mile of the islands,"], [346, "328 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. where it first decreases to 30 fathoms. The depths vary off the entrances to the \" strSms,\" but not with sufficient regularity to form a guide. From about 10 miles south-eastward of Lofotodden, a line of soundings varying from 90 to 120 fathoms runs in an E.N.E. direction to within a mile of the south-west side of Skraaven, off which, with the exception of several dangerous rocks, the ground is as steep as on the opposite side of the fiord. The bottom is covered with seaweed,* with isolated patches of stone. Although the depths outside several of the fiords of Lofoten is less than 25 fathoms, there are sometimes 80 to 90 fathoms in the fiords themselves. When entering Vest fiord in thick weather the lead becomes of consider able importance. Towards Lofotodden the strength of the tidal streams may render sounding difficult, but between that point and the entrance to GimsS Strom, where the soundings drop suddenly from 40 and 50 to 60 and 70 fathoms, a vessel will generally be about 4 miles from the land, provided she does not shoal the water to less than 60 or 50 fathoms. Eastward of Skraaven the lead is of no use, nearly 200 fathoms being found within half a mile of some of the rocks off HindS, and between 200 and 300 fathoms within the same distance of the mainland. DANGERS. \u2014 The dangers off the south-eastern coast of Lofoten, westward of Skraaven, are all within 1^ miles of the land ; but those in the inner part of the fiord extend from 2 to 5 miles off the south side of HindS. Brandsholmboeme are several sunken rocks lying 1-^ miles south of Brandsholm, and about S.W. by S. 2 miles from Urbierg, with SvinS bearing W. by N. ; these rocks dry at low water, and when covered nearly always break ; they must be given a good berth. Grundskallen is a steep rocky ridge southward of Vaagekallen, the northern part, on which there are 8 fathoms, lies S.S.E. 2| miles from Henningsv\u00e6r lighthouse ; the southern part carries 20 fathoms. Skraaven bearing E. by N. | N. will lead southward of Grundskallen. Bonden, the southernmost of the rocks off Skraaven, carries 6 feet, and lies about one mile from the south-western extreme of the island. Bredgrund, an 8-fathom patch lying N. by W. 2\\ miles from \u00c6ggelSsa, the point northward of TranS lighthouse, and nearly 3\\ miles S.W. A W. from Vaholm (Hvaholm,) is the southernmost shoal on the edge of a bank extending about 6 miles south-westward from OffersS ; for a distance of about 3 miles westward of Bredgrund the edge of the bank carries from 20 to 28 fathoms, but immediately beyond that there are from 111 to upwards of 200 fathoms; the eastern edge of the * Alga and Zostera."], [347, "329 CHAP. XIV.] VEST FIORD ; DIRECTIONS. bank, between Bredgrund and Vaholm, is equally steep. Vaholm or Hvaholm is a rather large grass-covered islet, 2 miles southward of OffersS, and will be easily recognised. The highest point of Lille Molla bearing W. by N., will lead southward of all the dangers off HindS, eastward of Skraaven. EAST SIDE Of VEST FIORD.\u2014 The westernmost known dangers on the east side of Vest fiord are Oiensveboen, Utgrund, and KjSlibS. Oiensveboen, a rocky ledge carrying 8 fathoms, lies N.W. A N. 5| miles from Oiholm with the eastern peak of Landegode bearing S. W. Utgrund, on which there are 12 fathoms, lies W. \\ N. 2| miles from Kuven and about W. by N. \\ N. 10 miles from the land on the north side of the entrance to Folden fiord, with the western summit of Landegode bearing S. by W. Kjolibo, a rock with less than 3 fathoms on it, lies S.W. \u00a3 S. three-quarters of a mile from MaalSskarholm. Reported Shoal. \u2014 According to tradition, the sea has been seen to break during unusually heavy gales on shoal ground about 6 miles west ward of Utgrund ; no such shoal can be found however, and if in existence, it probably carries nearly 20 fathoms, as the sea would break oftener if the depth were less. Vessels without a pilot should not, however, approach the outer shoals laid down on the chart off HusSbaran nearer than 10 miles. Marks. \u2014 Vaagekallen bearing N.E. by N., or Skraaven and Lille Molla in line, bearing about N.E., would lead well westward of all the dangers off HusSbaran ; but as these marks are too far off to be relied upon, it is better, as before observed, to keep over towards the Lofoten coast when entering Vest fiord from seaward. PILOTS live on Nauto, a small island on the east side of Skraaven ; and may also be obtained from the mainland on the opposite side of the fiord, in the neighbourhood of Fikke. Vessels bound to the northward through Vest fiord cannot do better than run for the south-east side of Skraaven when in want of a pilot. Rocks extend nearly a mile southward from the south point of Skraaven, but NautS may be approached to within 2 or 3 cables. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 It will be seen from the foregoing remarks that, as a general rule, vessels bound northward through Vest fiord should give the southern islets of RSst a berth of 15 miles, and proceed for Skraaven, keeping over towards Lofoten. From NautS, an E. i S. course should be steered until \u00c6ggelSsa is made out, and after passing within 2 miles of that point, TranS lighthouse should be brought to bear S.W. \u00a3 W. ; a N.E. \\ E. course for about 10 miles will then lead up to the passage"], [348, "330 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xrv. between BarS and Rotv\u00e6r, southward of Tiel Sund. When turning through the channel northward of TranS with an easterly wind, vessels might stand to the northward as far as Mefiordbo or BSskjer, which lies W.S.W. 2 J miles from Vaholm, and dries at low water; but with south-westerly winds Lille Molla should not be brought to bear south ward of W. by N. If the wind is light, the south side of Vaholm, and the rocks to the westward, may be passed at a distance of half a mile ; and should it fall calm an anchor may be dropped on the bank near BSskjer. At. night. \u2014 Entering Vest fiord at night, a vessel should endeavour to make Henningsv\u00e6r light, or some of the harbour lights on the south east side of Lofoten ; she will then be able to shape a course for TranS and LSdingen. The Helligv\u00e6r lights will also be useful guides. SOUTH-EAST COAST OF LOFOTEN.\u2014 With the excep- tion ofNufsfiord, Orsvaag, and Storvaag, none ofthe harbours on the south east coast of Lofoten are suitable for large vessels, but gunboats and mer chant vessels might be moored in most of them. Raftsund is the least dangerous and most remarkable of the channels between the Lofoten islands westward of Tiel Sund, but the latter is the only passage leading northward from Vest fiord within the islands. Sorvaag, between Mosken\u00e6s church and Glopen a projecting point about 5 miles north-eastward of Yttertuven, is the southern harbour on the south-east side of Lofoten. Glopen, and the entrances to Kirk fiord, will be easily recognised. LIGHT. \u2014 From a small building on the north side of Glopen afixed white light, elevated 128 feet, and visible from seaward between the bearing of E.N.E. (through north) to S.W. | S., except where obscured by the land between the bearings of E.N.E. and N.E. A E. is shown from the 1st of September to the 14th of April; it should be seen in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels may either pass between Glopen and a black rock named Kraaka, which lies N.N.E. from the lighthouse, or between Kraaka and SkjSrtebakken. In the first case it is necessary to keep close in to Glopen, as there are three sunken rocks off the south-east side of Kraaka ; and when taking the other channel it is best to keep nearest to Kraaka, between which and Mosken\u00e6sland there are two rocks which dry at low water. Off the houses on the north side of Glopen there are 4 to 6 fathoms, good saudy bottom ; the harbour is very narrow, but secure in all weathers, though a swell sets in when the wind blows out of Vest fiord,* and it is then difficult to leave. Outward bound vessels would therefore * This wind is termed \" botning \" by the fishermen."], [349, "CHAP. XIV.] 331 LOFOTEN, SOUTH-EAST COAST. do better to anchor in PrSssilvaag, a little farther to the northward ; there is also anchorage in Mosken\u00e6svaag, but it should only be used in summer, and southerly winds send a heavy sea in to both these places. Reine Havn, about 2^ miles north-eastward of SSrvaag, will be easily recognised by the rather lofty island OienilsS, in the middle of the entrance to Kirkfiord, and also by a large house to the westward. The entrance is between Langskjer, a long low rock off the south end of OienilsS, and a tolerably high islet named Lamholm, which lies half a mile southward of the lighthouse. LIGHT. \u2014 From the south point of OienilsS a fixed white light, ele vated 35 feet, and visible 5 miles from the bearing W. by S. \\ S. through north and east to S. by E., is shown from the 1st of September to the 14th of April. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The entrance between Lamholm and Langskjer will be open when OienilsS lighthouse is seen between the bearings of N. by E. \\ E. and North. When passing northward of Lamholm, care must be taken to avoid a spit carrying 3 fathoms, which runs off the south end of Lansgkjer ; vessels may then steer direct for the high island AndS, passing close to OienilsS in order to avoid Fiske rocks, which lie about W.N.W. IA cables from the lighthouse, and are .almost covered at high water. The best anchorage is off AndS, in 5 to 6 fathoms, as there are shoals in the bay to the southward, and also in OienilsS Sund. Fsesth\u00e6len. \u2014 South of F\u00e6sth\u00e6len, in Havnsund, is a small but good harbour a depth of 4 fathoms over sand ; but the entrances are so narrow that only small vessels can enter if there is any sea on. Sundstrom, the channel between Mosken\u00e6sS and FlagstadS, is narrow and foul, and only partially navigable for very small vessels. There is a small unimportant harbour at Sund with a depth of 4 fathoms, but it cannot be left if the wind is between south-east and south-west. There is a stone beacon on Little Grimsholm ; and Sundsbo, a shoal in the middle of the harbour, is marked by an iron pillar. Nufsfiord. \u2014 There is a good anchorage on the west side of Nufsfiord, the inlet westward of NapstrSm ; and within the high islet north of the houses is a large and secure basin with a depth of 10 to 15 fathoms ; it is difficult to leave however with southerly and south-easterly winds. Napstrom, between FlagstadS and Vest VaagS, though broader than SundstrSm, is equally foul, especially on the west side. There is anchorage at StrSmS and Nap. Balstado. \u2014 Southward of the peninsula between NapstrSm and Bugtsn\u00e6sfiord is a cluster of islets and rocks, between which are the"], [350, "332 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. entrances to BalstadS Havn. SvinS, the southernmost and largest of these islands, will be known by its height. LIGHT. \u2014 From the east side of SvinS, a fixed red light, elevated 189 feet, and visible 6 miles when bearing from S.E. \\ E. through north and west to S.W. \\ S., is shown from the 1st of September to the 14th of April. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If wishing to enter BalstadS Havn, pass nearly a mile eastward of SvinS, and proceed either eastward or westward of the iron pillar on Teistbo, which lies in mid-channel between the large islet JermesS and a cluster of small rocks to the north-eastward ; continue along the north side of JermesS, pass eastward of a shoal opposite the houses at Balstad, and bring up near a small rock on the west side of the sound to the northward, in 4 fathoms. When northward of JermesS a large warehouse will be seen in a bight to the south-westward, where there is also anchorage, but the water is not very deep. There is a still smaller anchorage on the south side of JermesS. Mortsund, Ure, Stene, and Stamsund.\u2014 Mortsund, on the east side of the entrance to Bugtsn\u00e6sfiord ; Ure, northward of Urbierg ; Stene, 2 miles north-eastward of Urbierg ; and Stamsund, about 1\\ miles eastward of Stene, are all good, but very small harbours, and the entrances are too narrow and difficult to be attempted by strangers. Stamsund has a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms over sand. LIGHT.\u2014 From the south point of TSrnholm (about E.N.E. 8 miles from SvinS), afixed white light, elevated 51 feet, and visible 8 miles from the bearing N.E. a N., through north to W. | N., is exhibited from the 1st of September to the 14th of April. The light is eclipsed in a south-westerly direction over Stabben rock, and should be kept on the starboard side when entering Stamsund. Skokkelvig islets. \u2014 Amongst the Skokkelvig islets, on the west side of the entrance to GimsS StrSm, there is a small harbour with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms over sand, but it is only used by small fishing vessels. GiniSO Strom, between East and West VaagS, and eastward of Gimso, is soul and intricate, and the tidal streams run with great velocity ; it is consequently a dangerous passage to attempt, even with a pilot, 'and northward bound vessels would afterwards have to pass close to the west side of LangS, one of the most dangerous places on the coast. Bratholmbo marked by a staff and broom ; Klokkestrandbo carries an iron pillar ; and is there is an iron pole with wooden sphere on Vassulbo. At Lyngv\u00e6r, about 2 miles northward of Vaagekallen, there is good anchorage amongst the islets, and also off the houses farther northward but a shoal runs off from the jetty. Brudgomsskjer, in the southern entrance to Lyngv\u00e6r, and Br\u00e6ndholmbo, near the anchorage, are marked"], [351, "333 CHAP. XIV.] SVINO \u2014 HENNINGSV\u00c6R. by iron pillars. Temporary anchorage may also be found at Sundklak and Barstrand, and there is a fair but shallow harbour for small craft at Sand northward of GimsS church . SuudklakstrSm, which separates GimsS from Vest Vaago, is very shallow, the depth in some parts being only 3 feet. HENNINGSV\u00c6R, off the south west point of East VaagS, is the largest of the Lofoten fishing stations, but the harbour is small. LIGHT. \u2014 On the west side of Henningsv\u00e6r, at the entrance to Saltv\u00e6ringsund, afixed white light, varied by a flash every three minutes, aud visible 14 miles in clear weather, is exhibited, at an elevation of 107 feet, from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. The light bearing N. E. by N. \\ N will lead up to the western entrance to the harbour. Hyseskjer Or Leiskjer in the Hanekam channel, Saugrund in the BrSdre channel, and LysSgrund in Henningsv\u00e6r, are marked by iron pillars. Directions. \u2014 The western entrance to Henningsv\u00e6r harbour is not difficult. Vessels may pass either northward or southward of Vestv\u00e6r, a cluster of small islets and rocks westward of Henningsv\u00e6r, and proceed for the anchorage, taking care to avoid Holl\u00e6nderen shoal, which lies south ward of a small black rock, and nearly always breaks. In fine summer weather the anchorage off the houses may be used, but as there is a con siderable swell there in bad weather, it is better to anchor farther to the eastward, in 4 to 6 fathoms, good sandy bottom. In thick weather it is necessary to guard against mistaking the north west point of Vestv\u00e6r for the point on the south side of the entrance to Henningsv\u00e6r harbour, as if the breakers on Barene were taken for those on Holl\u00e6nderen, a vessel would probably run right in amongst the rocks. If northward of Vestv\u00e6r in thick or rough weather, it is advisable to pass northward of all the rocks off Henningsv\u00e6r, hauling to the southward when past the western islets off Vaagekallen, until sufficiently sheltered from the sea, when the anchor may be let go in 10 to 12 fathoms, over sand. The eastern entrance to Henningsv\u00e6r harbour is marked by the BrSdre rocks, which are difficult for strangers to distinguish. CAUTION. \u2014 It is unadvisable to stand to the northward between Henningsv\u00e6r and Skraaven without a pilot, as it is difficult to make out the entrances to the harbours off which there are numerous rocks ; the passages between Skraaven and Raft Sund are only suitable for small coasters. Bikjeboen is a sunken rock on the southern extreme of a shoal extending three-quarters of a mile south-westward from the Mo holms, which lie 4 miles eastward of Henningsv\u00e6r."], [352, "334 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. Skjoldene rocks, which lie north-eastward of the Mo holms, off the entrances to the harbours between Vaagekallen and Vaage, are only uncovered at low water, but generally break if there is any swell. Hopen and OrsnSBS. \u2014 Hopen Havn, about 4 miles E.N.E. of of Henningsv\u00e6r, is the southern harbour on the south-east side of East VaagS ; it is not much used, as the heavy squalls that strike down from Vaagekallen render it an unsafe anchorage, especially in winter. Orsn\u00e6s Havn, a little eastward of Hopen, is very small, and the entrance is narrow. In both these harbours there are 3 to 5 fathoms good sandy bottom. ORSVAAG, half-way between Vaagekallen and Vaage church, has a depth of 3 to 5 fathoms over sand, and is the best harbour in Lofoten for large vessels. The best entrance is between the Mo holms and Skjoldene and eastward of SagSen. LIGHT. \u2014 On the west side of the principal entrance to Orsvaag, a fixed white light, elevated 85 feet, and visible 8 miles when bearing from N.E. by E. \\ E. through north and west to S.E. \\ E., is shown from the 1st of September to the 14th of April. The lighthouse, a yellow wooden building 24 feet high, stands on the north end of SagSen. Directions. \u2014 When entering Orsvaag, the northern part of SagSen must not be approached nearer than a quarter of a cable ; and a narrow ledge of rock, with only 7 feet on the shoalest part at low water, lies about 1^ cables, N. by W. from the lighthouse.* The best anchorage is N. \\ E. from the lighthouse. Storvaag and Kabelvaag arc the next harbours eastwardof Orsvaag. One large vessel might moor in Storvaag ; but Kabelvaag, southward of Vaage church, is narrow, and exposed to southerly winds and swell ; a breakwater is however in course of construction. In both these harbours there are 3 to 5 fathoms, over sand. Bjorgvinskjer in Kabelvaag is marked by an iron pole. SVOLV\u00c6R is one of the largest and safest harbours in Lofoten, and is therefore frequented by hundreds of vessels during the fishing season. LIGHT. \u2014 From KjeS, an islet on the east side of the south entrance to Svolv\u00e6r, a fixed red light, elevated 47 feet, and visible 6 miles from the bearing N.N.E. \\ E. through north and west to S.W. \\ S., is exhibited from the 1st of September to the 14th of April. Kjeogrundene are two shoals marked by ron poles. A shoal in Skjeringleden is also marked by an iron pole. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Hvalbensleden, the southern entrance to Svolv\u00e6r, is narrow, but not difficult. To enter from the southward give Skraaven * H.M.S. Racoon anchored near the centre of Orsvaag and tailed on to this ledge, with 38 fathoms of cable out. Large ships can moor on the east side of the harbour, clear of this shoal. \u2014 Master's Remark book, H.M.S. Racoon, 1864."], [353, "335 CHAP. XIV.] SVOLV\u00c6R \u2014 SKRAAVEN. a berth of 1^ miles, and steer direct for Svolv\u00e6 fjeld, which will be easily recognised as it is the highest mountain on the coast eastward of Vaage kallen. When nearly abreast of Vaage church, Rodholm, a round, high, grass-covered islet, will be seen on the port bow, and immediately eastward of Rodholm are some small low rocks, one of which, Hvalbenskjer, is composed of several large boulders lying one upon the other. When this rock is nearly ahead the sound will be open, and the flat point of SvinS, southward of which lies a solitary black rock, will be seen on the starboard hand. SvinS will also be known by the houses on it. The passage between Hvalbenskjer and the point to the eastward is perfectly clear, though in bad weather the sea appears to break nearly the whole way across ; smooth water will however be found within, and sail should be shortened on entering the sound. Vessels should keep on the east side of the sound at first, and then haul over to the westward to avoid a shoal off the eastern shore ; when past that, the anchor may be let go either in 10 fathoms on the west side of the harbour, or in 4 fathoms near the houses on the east side ; there is also an anchorage farther in. The outer harbour is exposed to heavy squalls off the mountain during north-westerly gales. The eastern entrance is difficult, and can only be taken with a pilot. At night, Svolv\u00e6r light bearing N. by E. A. E. will lead clear of the islets southward of Kjeo, and when past these, vessels may proceed west ward of the light for the anchorage. Helle, Vatterflord, and Skjoldv\u00e6r\u2014 The harbours at Helle, Vatterfiord, and Skjoldv\u00e6r, northward and eastward of Svolv\u00e6r, are only suitable for small craft. SKRAAVEN is an important fishing station frequented by numbers of vessels, but the entrances from the southward and westward are ex tremely difficult, while the channels leading in from the northward and eastward can only be taken by vessels of 6 to 8 feet draught, and even these would have to anchor outside Valen to wait for high water. The harbour has a depth of 4 fathoms near the land, and 8 to 10 fathoms farther out, over good holding ground. LIGHT. \u2014 On the western part of Sjaaholm, a fixed red fight is exhibited from the 1 st of September to the 14th of April ; it is elevated 22 feet, and should be visible 6 miles when bearing from E.N.E. through east to S. \\ E., except between the bearings S.E. \\ S. and S. by E. \\ E., when it is hidden by the land. The bearing E.N.E. leads well southward of Grundskallen. Directions. \u2014 To enter Skraaven from the westward, keep Sjaaholm lighthouse, or light, bearing E.N.E. until near Vasvikholm ; continue past the north side of the latter islet, and proceed southward and eastward of"], [354, "336 . FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [cnAP. xiv. Skjaaholm for the harbour, the entrance to which is very narrow, and should not be attempted by strangers. Passages north Of Skraaven. \u2014 There are passages between Skraaven and Lille Molla, and also between the latter island and Store Molla, but they can only be used by those acquainted with the locality. MoldSren, the sound between Lille and Store Molla, is narrow and shoal ; N\u00e6verS and Jomfruen are marked by iron pillars. There is a small but good harbour among the Guldbrands islets, on the south side of Lille Molla. The small harbours at Vikan, on the north-east side of Lille Molla, and Brettesn\u00e6s and Guldvik on the south-east side of Store Molla, are only used by fishing craft. Ohel Sund, on the west side of Store Molla, is blocked by a reef, which can only be crossed by small vessels at high water. Raftsund. \u2014 Eastward of Store Molla is the entrance to Raftsund, a deep, and compartively clear, but very narrow channel, between East Vaago and HindS. The land rises precipitously on the west side of the sound, but the eastern shore, though steep, is of a different character, and is covered with birch woods and pasture. Between Svartsund and HanS, spring tides attain a velocity of more than 6 knots, the stream turning from one to 2 hours after high and low water ; the wind also is very unsteady and squally. There is deep water close to the holms northward of Raft sund, and the passage itself is not very difficult; it is 15 miles long, and northward bound vessels would have to put to sea again aud proceed west ward of AndS, after passing through Sortland Sund, as RisS Sund is very shallow. Anchorage may be found at Slotholm, Digermulen, and Svartsund, and vessels may bring up almost anywhere close to the shore. South Side Of Hind6. \u2014 There is no anchorage for large vessels off the south side of HindS eastward of Raftsund, and the passages between the islands are foul and shallow. There are harbours in Risv\u00e6r, Svellin gen, and Kjeo, but they are only used by the small coasters connected with the cod and herring fisheries in Ogsfiord and Kanstadfiord. Smith holm, or Nordre Formandsholm, off OffersS, is distinguished by a stone beacon ; and Latmandsbo, eastward of KjeS, is marked by an iron pole. INNER LEAD. From Svartoxen vessels may either put into BodS, or proceed westward of Skibshohn, and eastward of Landegode, as directed ; or, if bound to the northward from Stableleden they may pass either eastward or westward of Giv\u00e6r and Helligv\u00e6r according to circumstances. From Landegode to the north side of EngelsS, a distance of 35 miles, the Inner Lead is so diffi cult, and the rocks and shoals forming the \" skjergaard \" on the east side of"], [355, "337 CHAP. XIV.] INNER LEAD. Vest fiord lie in such thick clusters, that it is almost impossible to find the various channels without a thorough knowledge of the locality, and many of the passages are so shallow that low water springs leave a depth of barely 10 feet. None of the anchorages on this reach are suitable for large vessels, and with the exception of the small harbours at Helligv\u00e6r, BodS is almost the only place on the east side of Vest fiord, that could be run for with safety in bad weather. When past the reef northward of Landegode, vessels may either proceed through the Saltv\u00e6rsled or eastward of the Fjerkviting group. SALTV\u00c6RSLED, the passage leading westward of Fjerkviting aud Engelv\u00e6r, and eastward of HusSbaran, is principally used by north ward bound coasters of light draught, which generally steer by compass or very imperfect leading marks ; few of those who take this passage are acquainted with half the dangers that lie there. Beacons. \u2014 Oiholm, on the west side of the south entrance to Saltv\u00e6r sled, is distinguished by a white stone beacon ; there is a cairn on Kuven, 10 miles northward of Oiholm ; and MaalSskarholm, about 4 miles N. by E. from Kuven, was formerly marked by a cross, which has fallen down. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The first anchorage in the Saltv\u00e6rsled is at the south end of the Fjerkviting group. The north-western entrance is between LSrvene and Bredgrund, and northward of ArSbo, which always breaks ; the sound leading thence to the anchorage is difficult to make out, and a shoal lies in the fairway. The south-western entrance is some what easier ; after passing on either side of HusSbo, and between the south side of HusS and two small rocks (the southernmost of the group), vessels may either bring up in from 10 to 16 fathoms over sand and stones southward of the high grass-covered islet at the north-east end of the sound, or proceed eastward of it to the anchorage on the north side of Kviting, where there are 4 fathoms over a good sandy bottom. Entering the latter anchorage from the eastward, vessels must give the north-east point of Kviting a fair berth, or if the wind is foul they may bring up off the point and warp in. Karlsd or Kalso Havn, 3 miles north-eastward of Kviting, is small but secure, and has a depth of 6 fathoms over sand and clay. The western entrance, southward of the Kvitholms, is not difficult, but it is necessary to keep on the north side of the sound. There is also an entrance from the northward. HUSO. \u2014 At HusS, north-westward of the Br\u00e6ntinderne, there is a fair small harbour with a depth of 10 to 12 fathoms over sand. Entering from the southward, vessels may pass on either side of MoSbo, which breaks constantly, and proceed westward of South MoS and HusS. The entrances westward of North MoS and Andholin are not difficult, but the passage south of Kviting is foul and shallow. K 740. - Y"], [356, "338 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. EngelV36r, a cluster of uninhabited islets 7 miles westward of EngelsS, has two very small harbours, one at each end of the group ; that at the north end is furnished with mooring rings, and there are 2 to 3 fathoms over sand at both places. These harbours are often used by small coasters, and there is a passage right through the group, but it is very narrow and difficult. , LANDEGODE to VEDO.\u2014 From Landegode the Inner Lead proper continues eastward of Fjerkviting to VedS. The channel eastward of Fjerkviting is deep and clear ; Heloskjer may be passed on either side, and besides the anchorages in Fjerkviting, there is a small harbour at the trading station of KjirringS, 3 miles eastward of Kvi ting : a rock in KjerringShavn is marked by an iron pole. From HelSskjer vessels should steer for KjSbmandskjer or DSdmand fald, which is marked by an iron pillar, and pass westward of it ; Svartoxen will then be the nearest rock to the north-westward, and after passing east ward of that, and westward of the three islets to the north-eastward, course may be altered to pass close to the west side of VedS and eastward of a large high islet northward of Svartoxen. There is also a passage west ward of Fl\u00e6sskallen and FISbo, but it is very intricate. Ved6 Havn. \u2014 If wishing to enter VedS Havn, pass northward of the southernmost and largest of the three islets north-eastward of VedS, and southward of the two smaller holms ; proceed between VedS and the high bare islet to the south-eastward, and bring up in the bay abreast of the houses in 4 to 6 fathoms, over sand. A sand bank near the entrance to the harbour will show as a light patch at low water, but the least depth on it is 4 fathoms. When proceeding northward from VedS Havn vessels may either keep close to the mainland, or pass westward of the high round holm in the middle of the sound, but care must be taken to avoid the shoals off the north point of VedS. Ole PersS in Vedosund is marked by a stone beacon. VEDO to VALS V\u00c6R.\u2014 From VedS the Inner Lead continues westward of Sjaaholm, aud eastward of BensS, to Leiskjer. Northward of Leiskjer, the depth of the channel nowhere exceeds 5 or 6 fathoms, and is for the most part not above 3 or 4 fathoms ; the bottom is therefore visible nearly the whole way to Valsv\u00e6r. All the channels on this reach are extremely intricate and narrow, and the dangers are so numerous that a slight mistake would probably lead to disaster. Beacons. \u2014 The following beacons mark the principal dangers between VedS and Valsv\u00e6r : \u2014 Sjaaholm is a blackish, round, and rather high islet, marked by a white stone beacon with black vertical stripes, surmounted by a wooden mark ; there are similar beacons on Leiskjer and Brmgeb\u00e6rsundholm."], [357, "339 CHAP. XIV.] LANDEGODE TO VALSV\u00c6R. South of GrStS : \u2014 Skaten, marked by an iron pillar ; Bringeb\u00e6rsund \u2014 iron pole marked in feet ; Malts\u00e6kken \u2014 iron pillar ; Helligholm \u2014 stone beacon ; and HelligholmSren, marked by an iron pole.

Westward of GrStS. \u2014 Klepholmtangen MaalS, and a shoal on the west side of the channel south of MaalS, marked by iron poles. Mefaldsbo \u2014 iron pole. Brokskjer, between Engelv\u00e6r and GrStS \u2014 iron pillar. Directions. \u2014 There are 12 fathoms within 10 yards of the west side of Leiskjer, and it is necessary to pass very close to that rock in order to avoid the reefs to the westward. When past Leiskjer, steer for the high round islets named Brettingerne, in order to avoid the rocks Brettings boerne, which do not break at high water. Proceed eastward of Bretting erne, and steer direct for Spanna, a high and somewhat isolated hill on the mainland, taking care to avoid the shoals on both sides of the channel. Thorough local knowledge is indispensable to \u25a0 the safe navigation of Bringeb\u00e6rsund and GrStSsund* (the channels westward and northward of Spanna), and no directions can be given that would be practically useful. Vessels drawing more than 12 feet can only pass through at high water ; easterly and south-easterly winds blow straight through GrStSsuud with irregular puffs ; and the tidal streams are very strong, the flood setting northward and the ebb southward. Northward of GrStSsund, the passage becomes somewhat easier, but there are shoals on both sides, which are invisible at high water. Hol kestadn\u00e6saxlen, kept exactly in line with Steget, is the mark for clearing these dangers. Steget is a flat stone, with perpendicular sides, on the upper part of Stegebierg, the western peak of EngelsS. The channels leading from Holkestadn\u00e6s past LSvS and through Valsv\u00e6r, require perfect local knowledge, but the passage leading northward of Engelv\u00e6r to Vest fiord is less difficult. From Holkestadn\u00e6s vessels may proceed southward of EngelsS to Sag fiord, which is also connected with Vest fiord by the channels east and west of LundS. Skaanlandsholm, or Vikholm, is marked by a stone beacon ; BogSgrund by a staff and broom ; and Langgrund, in SSr Oxsund, by an iron pillar. * In approaching the station of Groto the steamer was navigated through a singular natural canal, of so intricate a kind that more than once it was impossible to divine how she should be extricated. \u2014 Professor Forbes. Y 2"], [358, "340 FLEINA TO VEST VAAGO. [chap. xiv. Anchorage. \u2014 Lein\u00e6s Havn is the first anchorage northward of VedS. To enter from the southward, pass southward of Sjaaholm, and steer for the south point of the nearest high island, continuing along its west side until past the north point, when the anchor may be let go in 4 to 8 fathoms over sand and shells. There is also anchorage farther northward off the houses. The northern entrance is between Fiordskjer and Fiordskjerbo, and eastward of the two small rocks at the north end of the sound ; on the west side of those rocks the depth is only 6 to 9 feet. Bringeb\u00e6rsund has anchorage iu 2 to 3 fathoms over sand and stones ; and off the warehouse in GrStSsund, where mooring rings have been placed by the proprietor, there are 3 to 5 fathoms, same bottom. Small craft may bring up in Valsv\u00e6r, but the channel has barely 12 feet in it at low water springs ; the bottom consists of sand. VALSV\u00c6R to TRANO and TIEL SUND\u2014 Northward of Valsv\u00e6r, the east side of Vest fiord is perfectly clear to TranS, whence, as before mentioned, a N. E. E. course for about 10 miles will lead up to the entrance to Tiel Sund. LIGHT. \u2014 Stangholm lighthouse, a wooden building on the west side of TranS, exhibits a fixed white light, elevated 39 feet, and visible 11 miles when bearing from E. f N. through south to W. A S.; from the 15th of August to the 30th of April ; the bearing E. by N. falls northward of SelsSodden. Anchorage. \u2014 Brunv\u00e6r, off' the north point of EngelsS, has anchorage for small vessels in 5 fathoms over sand.- Entering from the southward, pass northward of all the visible rocks, and southward of the largest island of the group ; proceed in mid-channel through the sound to the eastward, and bring up on the south side of it. About a quarter of a mile south eastward of the northern islet of Brunv\u00e6r is a rock which dries at low water, and a 4-fathom patch lies half a mile eastward of the same islet ; these dangers may be avoided by keeping within half a mile of LundS. Dalsv\u00e6r, 5 miles north-eastward of Brunv\u00e6r, has a small harbour with a depth of 3 fathoms, but it is very difficult to make out the entrance. Both Dalsv\u00e6r and StrSmhavn, 3 miles to the northward, are exposed to violent squalls. BjSrnvaag and Buvaag are two small and very indifferent harbours in the neighbourhood of Fikke, about 4 miles W.S.W. of TranS. The small harbour at BuS, 2 miles S.S.W. of TranS light, is seldom used, being out of the regular track of vessels ; and Engelsholmshavn at TranS is only used by small vessels bound to the northward."], [359, "341 CHAPTER XV.

GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 The northern part of the great island chain extending 150 miles north-east and south-west between RSst and Anden\u00e6s is known as Vesteraalen, and includes the islands AndS, LangS, HasselS or TJlvS, and the north-western part of HindS ; the latter has a circumference of about 140 miles, and is thus the largest island on the coast of Norway ; it is intersected by numerous fiords, the inner parts of which are separated from each other by low and narrow isthmuses. In the western and southern parts of the island the mountains are generally high, steep, and wild, especially eastward of Guiles fiord, where they attain an elevation of about 4,000 feet ; between Kv\u00e6 fiord and Vaags fiord the hills are rounder and lower, only one mountain Hemmestadfjeld, rising to a height of about',3,000 feet. The pleasant aspect of HasselS, and the beautiful scenery of Sortland-sund, where the frowning crags in the background are fronted by well wooded hills and green slopes, form a striking contrast to the barren coasts of Salten and Lofoten. The western part of LangS is pierced in every direction by arms of the sea, but the east coast is less ragged. Underlying the Dverberg marshesf on AndS is a stratum of Jura sandstone, with ammonites and belenites, coal and carbonaceous slate ; the coal measures having been found worth working, the island may acquire con- siderable importance, and it has been proposed to construct a tramway between Dverberg and RisS havn. Eastward of Vesteraalen and north ward of Ofoten fiord, is the Amt of TromsS, which up to 1866 was a part of Finmarken. TROMSO AMT, which includes the subdistricts of Senjen and TromsS, extends from Ofoten fiord to Kv\u00e6nangen fiord, has an area of * See Admiralty charts: \u2014 Norway, sheet x, Lofoten islands to Ando, No. 2,312, and Norway, sheet xi, Ando to Helgo, No 2,313. f In autumn the marshes on Ando are quite yellow with cloudberries (Rubus chamamorus) in Norwegian \" multeb\u00e6r,\" which are gathered in great quantities for the Christiana market. The cloudberries from the north of Norway have a much finer aroma than those grown in the southern parts ofthe country."], [360, "342 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. 9,448 square miles, with a population of about 48,500.* The inhabitants consist of Norwegians, Qaains, and Lapps, the western part of the Amt being chiefly peopled by Norwegians, and the eastern hundreds (herreder) by Lapps and Quains. This province may be characterised generally as an Alpine region, both the mainland and the islands which protect it from the sea being nearly covered with jagged precipitous peaks, separated by deep and narrow ravines. The vegetation which clothes every valley, glen, and mountain slope is remarkable for so high a degree of latitude, and presents a striking contrast to the rugged outlines of the fjelds, imparting great beauty and variety to the scenery. The limit of,the birch is from 1,000 to 1,200 feet above the sea on the coast, but rises to 1,800 feet in the interior, where the pine also flourishes at a considerable elevation.f There are numerous snowlields and glaciers, but most of the latter disappear at some distance above the sea ; avalanches and stone slips are of frequent occurrence, and several rivers have forced their way through the mountains, emerging on the opposite sides. The mountainous peninsula between Ulf s fiord and Lyngen fiord, east ward of the town of TromsS, is the northern extreme of a chain of lofty peaks which extends from thenee on the meridian of about 20\u00b0 E. longi tude to. the lake of Tornea Trask. From this range the ground declines on either side, but in a different manner ; to the westward the descent is gradual, the country preserving its Alpine character both throughout the coast region, where the principal summits attain an elevation of 3,000 to 5,000 feet, and also on the larger islands which generally vary in height from 2,000 to about 4,000 feet ; the eastern declivity is much more abrupt, and the transition to the plateaux of Finmarken is distinctly perceptible. J\u00e6ggevarre, south of Lyngseid, the loftiest mountain in the Amt, is 6,500 feet high. A striking characteristic of this Amt is the vast number of fiords and sounds which divide the coast and islands into numerous sections bounded on the landward side by isthmuses which seldom exceed a few hundred feet in height ; some of these fiords form good entrances from seaward and sheltered inshore passages, while others penetrate far into the mainland ; and as most of the roads (except those in the vallies) are mere reindeer paths (renveie), used by the Lapps in their spring and autumn migrations, the sea is by far the most importantant means of communication. * In 1815 the population was only 17,686 ; it has thus nearly trebled since that time. t The retrograde tendency of these limits, especially that of the sir, is very generally perceptible, even where no timber has ever been felled."], [361, "CHAP. XV.] 343 GENERAL REMARKS. Owing to the nature of the country, and the fact that most of the inhabitants of northern Norway depend chiefly on the fisheries, the coast is more thickly populated than the interior ; and agriculture, though carried on with tolerable success in some of the valleys, (those of Bardo and Lyngen being the most northern corn lands in the world), is but a secondary business. The upland pastures are however of considerable importance, and the loftier tracts, which cannot be used by the farmers, are grazed every summer by about 112,000 tame reindeer. The mineral resources of TromsS Amt would appear to be inconsiderable ; as yet, however, they are undeveloped. Sport. \u2014 Most of the lakes and rivers in TromsS Amt abound in fish, the principal varieties being salmon, trout, char, grayling, and turbot. Good shooting is to be found almost everywhere. Ptarmigan are plentiful on the coast ; capercailzie and black game are found in the larger valleys, and golden plover are common on the mountains. Hares are very abundant. Wild reindeer are scarce ; they are principally found in the mountains near the Rosta-elv. Otters and seals are occasionally killed. Bears have multiplied of late years, especially in Kv\u00e6nangen, on Senjen island, in SSr Reisen, and Maalselv ; wolves also have increased. Lynx and glutton, are local ; hawk, falcon, and owl, are common ; eagles are less frequent. Sea fowl are plentiful on the coast ; ducks and divers in almost every lake and tarn, and geese abundant near the frontier and in the northern fiords. VEST FIORD TO TROMSO. Before returning to the outer coast, it will be convenient to follow the Inner Lead from Vest fiord to TromsS, in order to preserve the continuity of the various channels as far as possible. TIEL-SUND, which, as already observed is the only inland means of communication between Vest fiord and the northern ports, is in several places very narrow, and the channel is rendered intricate by dangerous sunken rocks and shoals ; the tidal streams also are very strong, and the numerous whirls and eddies necessitate careful steerage. As, however, the principal dangers are well marked, the aid of a pilot, though desirable, is not indispensable with daylight and a fair wind. Large vessels can only pass Sandtorv at high water.* Tides. \u2014 In the southern part of Tiel sund^ the streams turn at high and low water, but in BalstadstrSm and at Sandtorv they turn about three hours later. The flood sets northward and the ebb southward. * The scenery of Tiel sund is much less striking than that of Vest fiord, but the appearance, not to be mistaken, of limestone cliffs, gives it a peculiar character, interesting not to the geologist alone. \u2014 Professor J. D. Forbes."], [362, "344 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. LIGHT. \u2014 From a small building on the eastern part of Hjertholm (LSdingen), on the west side of the entrance to Tiel sund, a fixed white light is exhibited from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. The light is elevated 61 feet, and should be visible 8 miles when bearing from N.N.E. \\ E. through west to S.S.W. f W. The bearing N.N.E. \\ E. falls \\\\ cables eastward of the eastern rocks of Rotv\u00e6r ; and the bearing S.S.W. f W. falls eastward of Falken and Strandholm. Havneskallen, on which there are 16 feet at low water, lies about 3 cables N.N.E. \\ E. from Hjertholm lighthouse; the east and north sides of Hjertholm may be passed at a distance of half a cable. Palken, which lies about 3 cables southward of Strandholm is marked by an iron pole. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 After passing Vaholm (Hvaholm), LSdingsaxlen mountain, between Tiel-sund and the broad opening of Kanstad fiord, will be easily recognised, and on approaching the small low islets of Rotv\u00e6r the church at LSdingen will be visible. Having passed the east side of Rotv\u00e6r at a distance of 3 or 4 cables, the highest islet of that group in line with the highest of the HammerS peaks will lead clear into Tiel sund. When beating into Tiel sund vessels should not bring the south-west extreme of BarS to bear northward of N.E. by N. in order to avoid the shoal ground extending about 3 miles from the high land on the north side of Tys fiord. The rocks on the west side of the entrance to Kanstad fiord may be approached to within 2 or 3 cables, but a reef extends a good half mile southward of Rotv\u00e6r, and there are rocks nearly the whole way from that group to LSdingen. The south-west side of TielS is also shoal from 2 to 4 cables off shore. In fine weather vessels might bring up on the shoal ground that, runs southward from LSdingen, in 6 to 7 fathoms good holding ground, with the parsonage house bo aring between North and N.N.W. LSdingen or Roliolm havn, between HjertS and Roholm, has a depth of 10 fathoms, shoaling to 5 fathoms within half a cable of the shore, over sand.* Having passed Havneskallen, Hjertholm in line with the east side of Rotv\u00e6r will lead eastward of Falken and Munkskjer, whence it is advisable to keep as nearly as possible in mid-channel up to BalstadstrSm. When turning through the southern part of Tiel-sund, vessels must not stand to the westward between Strandholm and Strand, the whole of the bay being shallow, and the west side of TielS should not be approached nearer * The yacht Annie anchored here in December 1874 during a south-easterly gale, and obtained fresh water. Nine coasters, including two steamers and a brig, came in after wards. The situation of the anchorage is convenient and sheltered, but large ships would run the risk of tailing on to Havneskallen. \u2014 Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N."], [363, "CHAP. XV.] TIEL SUND ; DIRECTIONS. 345 than 2\\ cables. The projecting point of Fiskeskagene, and the point at Taraldvig, should also be given a berth of at least 2 cables. Small craft might bring up in Dybf\u00e6st havn, a creek north-westward of Munksjer, in 4 to 6 fathoms over sand and clay ; the north side of Mun ksjer must be given a fair berth. There is also indifferent anchorage at Stagsvold and Kongsvig, in 12 and 10 fathoms ; the bottom is very irregu lar, and shoals rapidly towards Kongsvig. Large vessels sometimes bring up here when waiting for high water to pass Sandtorv. In passing through BalstadstrSm it is advisable to keep rather to the southward of mid-channel, except at Stensvig, where it is necessary to edge to the northward to avoid Stensvigflue, on which there is an iron pole. Hofen\u00e6s, the northernmost point of land between the houses at Hof and Stensvig, kept a little open southward of Haarbjerg, will lead northward of Stensvigflue. About three-quarters of a mile eastward of Balstad, a 2-fathom patch lies from 1 to 2 cables southward of S\u00e6ter, and between this and Ulvig vessels may bring up in 8 fathoms to wait wind or tide.* Ram-sund, a narrow channel on the east side of TielS, is very shallow and foul. Holsfluen, on the north-western extreme of an extensive sand bank which runs off the mainland between Ram-sund and Lavang fiord, is marked by a square stone beacon with cairn and pole , East Fjelddalsflue, on the northern edge of the same bank, southward of Sandtorv, is marked by a red nun buoy with staff and broom ; and West Fjelddalsflue, a rock on the opposite side of the channel, close to HindS, carries an iron pole. The south-eastern edge of Kobstengrund, a shoal occupying the northern part of the bight on the south side of the low projecting point north of Sandtorv, is marked by a square stone beacon with pole ; Storgrund, about 3 cables south-eastward of Kobstengrund, is marked by two red nun buoys ; Kobber skjer carries an iron pole ; and there is an iron pillar on Notlaget, north of Sandtorv. When approaching Holsfluen, keep the warehouses at Balstad in sight to the northward of Hofsn\u00e6s ; proceed in mid-channel between the shoals off Fjelddal, and keep rather close in to Sandtorv to avoid being swept off by the tide ; continue between Storbo and Kobstengrund, and when well past Skaanland chapel, where shoals extend nearly 3 cables from the mainland, the channel is open and clear up to Leikvig, and the land on either side may be approached to a distance of one cable. There is anchorage at Sandtorv off the merchant's wharf southward of Kobstengrund in from 15 to 10 fathoms, good holding ground, and small vessels may bring up off the point to the northward.

At Leikvig, about 3 miles northward of Sandtorv, the channel is nar rowed by several low grass-covered islets, and about 40 yards from the east side of the southern islet is a rock marked by a buoy with staff and broom. The south, middle, and north Stenslands rocks are marked respectively by an iron pole, a square stone stage, and an hon pillar. It is necessary to keep as nearly as possible in mid-channel between the Leikvig holms and the mainland, where, though the bottom is generally visible, there are probably from 8 to 10 fathoms. t In the northern part of Tiel Sund, between Leikvig and Gr\u00e6sholm, are the following shoals and beacons : \u2014 Voldstadfluen, about IA cables from Voldstad, is marked by an iron pillar, and immediately to the northward is a small bank of sand. Skallen, which lies a little westward of mid-channel, half a mile eastward of Fuskevaag, carries 4 fathoms, and never breaks. Svartskjerene are several rocks above water on a reef extending about half a mile from the mainland between Kvitn\u00e6s and Gr\u00e6sholm. Taakebo, on which there is only one fathom, lies about 3 cables S.E. \\ E. from Gr\u00e6sholm, and is marked by a staff and broom. Gr\u00e6sholm is distinguished by a stone beacon, and a rock lying 3 cables to the north-eastward is marked by an iron pole. Having passed between 2 and 3 cables eastward of Voldstadfluen, vessels should steer so as to pass about 2\\ cables north-westward of Svartskjerene. North Stenslandsn\u00e6s, shut in with the houses at Sandtorv, will also lead between Skallen and Svartskjerene up to Taakebo ; and after passing about one cable eastward of Gr\u00e6sholm course may be altered either for Vaags fiord or Asta fiord. Gr\u00e6sholm Havn is a small but secure harbour with a depth of 4 to 7 fathoms, over'sand ; there are scarcely 3 fathoms in the southern entrance at low water, but the eastern entrance is deeper. Steilholm, on which there is a cairn, is the eastern islet of the group, and must be given a fair berth. There are five floating marks on the various rocks in and near Gr\u00e6sholm Havn.

Under these circumstances northward bound vessels should endeavour to make TiStS, while those bound to the southward from Salberg fiord should keep over towards SenjenS, and bring up for the night either off the north-east end of LekangsS, or on the east side of Stangn\u00e6sland, westward of Bolholm, where there is better anchorage. Coasting vessels sometimes bring up during calms on the east side of Engen\u00e6s, the north-western extreme of AndorgS, but it is a very exposed position. The entrance to StrSmmen, 1J miles south-eastward of Engen\u00e6s, is so narrow, and the tides rush through with such velocity, that it is often quite unnavigable. Strong northerly winds raise a confused, short, disagreeable sea when the flood stream is making to the northward, and southerly winds produce the same effect during the ebb. When passing through Vaags fiord with a fair and 6teady breeze there is nothing to fear ; but when beating to windward, care must be taken to avoid Langgrund and the shoals between Roeln and Top-sund, as well as those off the south-western part of RollenS ; the rocks off North Roln\u00e6s and Bispeflue on the west side of the entrance to Solberg fiord, must also be given a good berth. Langgrund, which carries 4 fathoms, lies about half a mile south eastward of the little round rock Alskjer ; the eastern extremes of Rogeln and Lille Rogeln in line will lead eastward of this shoal. Between Rogeln and Top-sund.\u2014 The tracks shown on the chart on the west side of Vaags fiord, between Rogeln and Top-sund, show the channels used by coasters when bound to and from the various trading stations ; but strangers would find it difficult to distinguish the numerous small islets and rocks, and, as there are several dangerous shoals between them, it is unadvisable to stand to the westward of a line joining Lille Rogeln and the west side of TiStS without a pilot.

Svartskjerbo, and a sunken rock south of MaagS, are marked by staff and broom beacons, and there is a stone beacon on MaagS. RSken\u00e6sbo, on the northern extreme of a shoal extending nearly a mile northward from MaagS, dries at low water and is marked by an iron pole ; there is also an iron pole on Kraaken\u00e6sbo. Vessels will be eastward of Aarn\u00e6sbo (which carries 3 to 4 fathoms, and lies on the eastern edge of the shoal between MaagS and RSken\u00e6sbo), as long as Svartskjer is well open eastward of MaagS. RSken\u00e6s house, kept open northward of Kraaken\u00e6s, will lead northward of RSken\u00e6sbo. When entering Top-sund from Vaags fiord, it is advisable to keep well over towards the south point of TiStS, and to pass northward of the small island TjeS, in order to avoid the shoals to the southward. There is a small anchorage on the south-east side of TjeS. Storholm. \u2014 A sandy spit runs nearly 2 cables off the west and north sides of Storholm, which lies about a mile westward of South Roldn\u00e6s, the south-western extreme of RollenS, and nearly the whole of the space between the islet and point is occupied by a stony shoal.

The harbour proper, north-west ward of the only house on TiStS, has a depth of 10 to 6 fathoms over fine sand and clay. In fine weather small vessels may also bring up off the entrance to the sound, between the north-east point of TiStS and the islet to the northward, in 5 to 7 fathoms, good holding ground ; but they must not stand too far in, as the sound is nearly dry at low water. SOLBERG FIORD is a broad clear channel on the south side of SenjenS. When beating through, vessels must not approach TranS nearer than half a mile ; a small sunken rock lies opposite the house at Belholm ; aud between that and Mobakken, a shoal runs from 2 to 5 cables off' the mainland. With these exceptions there is nothing to fear between Bispe fluen and KISven. After rounding .the point northward of KISven a N.N.W. course for 2 miles will lead to Finsn\u00e6s, on the east side of the entrance to Gi Sund. TranSbotten is a broad but shoal inlet extending about 3 miles northward from TranS. South Reisen fiord extends about 2 miles inland from the east end of Solberg fiord, and receives the waters of two small rivers. There are no harbours in Solberg fiord between Belholm and KISven, but vessels would find shelter in DyrS sund when bound either way. KISven is a flourishing trading station at the east end of Solberg fiord ; there is a very small but snug harbour on the south side of the poiut opposite the merchant's houses, with a depth of 6 to 8 fathoms over clay and loose sand. In the outer part of the harbour the ground is uneven and rocky, and a rock which covers at high water, lies close to the point on the north side of the entrance. DYRO SUND, between DyrS and the mainland, has several fair anchorages, which are especially useful in winter to vessels meeting with bad weather in Vaags fiord or Solberg fiord. There are shoals off the house at Myklebostad, on the east side of DyrSgummen, and also off the point eastward of DyrS church, therefore these places should be given a berth of 2 or 3 cables. On the east side of the sound, immediately northward of the house at Kastn\u00e6s, a shoal with two rocks on it runs about 2 cables off shore ; at Skjeret, which bears about E.S.E. from DyrS church, a shoal runs off about one cable, and there are several rocks off the point on the west side of Broderstadbotten. Northward bound vessels generally anchor westward of the small islet off DyrS church ; northward of the shoal ground extending about one cable off shore opposite the houses at Dybvig ; or in the cove at the north east extreme of DyrS.

A reef runs nearly IA cables off the point on the east side of Havn, and the north and west sides of the point west of Kastn\u00e6shavn are shoal nearly 2 cables off shore.

J MjOSUnd, a narrow channel between AndorgS and the mainland, leads from Vaags fiord and DyrS-sund to Asta fiord, but being exposed to violent squalls it is very seldom used except by coasters bound to the trading stations Lavangsn\u00e6s and Havnvigen. There is a passage on each side of the holm in the middle of the sound, but when taking the eastern passage it is necessary to keep as far as possible from the mainland, as if taken aback by a squall a vessel would very likely be stranded on the shoal off' the south side of the point north-eastward of the holm. It often happens that after working up to DyrS it is necessary to bear up or seek shelter, in consequence of the violent gusts from TranSbotten and DyrSgummen. In this case TiStS harbour is a long way to leeward, and if unable to' make Kastn\u00e6shavn, vessels might bring up in MjS-sund, either immediately south of the holm or east of the shoal off the point to the northward ; the latter anchorage is sheltered from all winds except those from the south-east, with which it is easy to get under weigh. Bygden, between RollenS and AndorgS, connects Vaags fiord and Asta fiord. Coasting vessels bound from TromsS to Lofoten in January and February, and leaving TromsS with north-west or westerly winds (which blow from the south-west and south in Vaags fiord) are frequently obliged to run into Bygden or MjS-sund, and when a westerly gale drives the land wind back, their only place of refuge is in one or other of the branches of Asta fiord. * Lieutenant G.

Vessels may pass either eastward of Ty vholm or westward of Fladholm, but the whole space between these islets is shallow. Asta fiord, which separates RollenS and AndorgS from the main land, is free from danger, with the exception of the shoal eastward of Storholm, which extends about a mile south-westward from South Roldn\u00e6s. In fine weather vessels may bring up off Havnvigen, on the east side of RollenS, but there is no secure harbour in the whole of the fiord. Asta fiord sends four small branches into the mainland. Grav fiord, southward of Drangen mountain, is about 3 miles long ; the outer and inner parts are connected by a narrow sound, through which the tidal streams run with great velocity. Gratangen is a winding inlet about 8 miles long ; the shores are steep and inaccessible except at the inner end. Lavangen is about 5 miles in length ; the shores of the outer part are precipitous, but become less bold towards the inner end, where alluvial banks of con siderable extent have been deposited by the Spansdal river. These three inlets are free from danger, but a shoal extends nearly 2 cables off shore between Myrland and the entrance to Gratangen, and there are two rocks off Lavangsn\u00e6s, on the north side of the entrance to Lavangen. Salangen extends about 3 miles eastward from AndorgS, and at the inner end is a cluster of islets and rocks, from which Sag fiord runs 2 miles to the southward. All these fiords are inhabited, and, with the exception of Sag fiord and the inner part of Gratangen, (which freezes to a distance of about 2 miles from the mouth ofthe Fiordbotten river), they are generally open all through the winter, but violent squalls strike down from the surrounding mountains.* GI-SUND, a winding channel between SenjenS and the mainland, connects the Solberg and Malang fiords ; it is' about 16 miles long from Finsn\u00e6s to Aglapsvik, and at LSkhelle and Gibostad the navigable channel is only from 2 to 3 cables broad.

The flood sets northward from Vaags fiord, DyrS-sund, and Solberg fiord, past KISven and Finsn\u00e6s, but loses strength towards Leikn\u00e6s, where it meets the stream which runs to the southward past Lenvik and Gibostad from Malang fiord. From Leikn\u00e6s the ebb sets southward past Finsn\u00e6s and KISven, and northward past Gibostad and Lenvik to Malangen fiord, where it meets the west-going stream from Ry StrSmmen, and runs out to sea. At Finsn\u00e6s the streams turn at high and low water.

DIRECTIONS. \u2014 It is evident from the foregoing remarks that caution must be observed in passing through Gi-sund, especially if under sail. There would be no difficulty in obtaining a pilot before entering the sound, and it is unadvisable to proceed without one in winter ; but in summer, with avfair wind, there would be but little risk in doing so.f Entering Gi-sund from the southward, pass close westward of Finsn\u00e6s and the rocks to the northward ; give the point between LSkhelle and Viken a berth of 2 or 3 cables, and then steer so as to pass about 2 cables westward of Leikn\u00e6s.

When well past Lenvik church, the entrance to Malang fiord, will be opened, and the channel is then free from danger up to Ry StrSmmen. When beating to windward between Gi-sund and Ry StrSm men it must however be borne in mind that the south side ot KvalS is shoal to a distance of from one to 3 cables off shore ; Aglapsbo, in the bay north of Aglapen, will be avoided by keeping Bentsjordtind in line with the point on the east si3e of Aglapsvik.

On the north side of Kaarvik there is anchorage in 6 fathoms ; but a shoal with 3 fathoms on the north-west extreme, extends 4 cables from the shore south of the Sandbak river. Small craft may bring up north eastward of Hann\u00e6s, one mile north-westward of Sletn\u00e6s, in 6 fathoms ; the bights north and south of the point are shoal. There are 1 1 fathoms about 2 cables from the shore south-westward of Lenvik church, and 10 fathoms westward of the church, shoaling rapidly towards the bight. Lenvik has a depth of 3 fathoms near the point on the north side ; but southward of the church there are only 7 feet. RY STROMMEN, a remarkable strait and rapid between KvalS and the small island RyS, is about IA miles long, and in the narrowest part is barely 2J cables broad, therefore the numerous whirlpools render it a somewhat hazardous passage even for steam vessels, and it can only be taken by sailing vessels when the tide is favourable.* The stream changes * H.M.S.

The town is pleasantly situated on the east side of the small but remarkably fertile island from which it takes its name ; it is fronted by a row of warehouses, has several regular streets, with large private houses and good shops, and presents a singularly thriving and cheerful appearance, the luxuriant vegetation and numerous picturesque villas on the hill above the town, which barely exceeds a height of 400 feet, presenting an agreeable contrast to the wild mountain scenery in the back ground. Tromsdalstind, on the mainland eastward of TromsS, is 4,064 feet high ; and in Tromsdal is a well-known Lapp encampment. TromsS is the residence of the Stift Amtmand and the bishop ; and besides several churches and good schools, has a hospital, a savings bank, a branch of the Bank of Norway and ofthe Nordenfjeldske Credit bank, and a museum. Since the crisis of 1867, TromsS has more than regained its former com mercial activity ; its prosperity is mainly due to the brisk foreign trade created by the extensive fisheries of Northern Norway ; the sealing ex peditions annually despatched to Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya have also been very successful of late years, and a lucrative trade is carried on with Arkhangel. With the exception of several establishments for the prepa ration of cod liver and train oil, two tanneries, a rope walk, and a brewery, TromsS has no manufactories ; there are very few mechanical workshops ; and ship-building is almost confined to repairing the vessels belonging to and frequenting the port. In 1876 the value of the imports, which consist of manufactured goods and articles of home consumption, amounted to 94,444/., and that of the exports, which are chiefly the produce of the fisheries, was 27,778/. the Customs' receipts amounting to 13,500/. In the same year vessels clearing inwards registered 19,700 tons, and those clearing outwards 9,400 ; the aggregate tonnage of vessels belonging to the port was only 1,700, having greatly decreased since 1866, owing to the rapid progress of steam com munication. Supplies of coal and provisions may be obtained at TrSmso; but water should be procured from the east side of TromsS-sund, that supplied to the town from Pr\u00e6stevand, a lake with boggy shores, being indifferent. An English vice-consul is resident. TrOlUSO harbour is formed by a small bay with a bar to the east ward. Owing to the filling up of the harbour by deposit it is now very small, and vessels drawing more than 10 feet often touch the ground at low water springs. Where the larger class of vessels lie, there is only room for 7 or * See plan of Tromso havn on Admiralty chart, No. 2,313. Z 2"], [374, "356 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. 8 vessels, moored head and stern, but there is water enough for small craft to the northward and southward. The north and south ends of the bar forming the east side of TromsS harbour are marked by square beacons built of stones and rough spars, with poles in the middle ; and there is a similar beacon on a rock off Hanskjon\u00e6s, a little north of the town. Vessels should pass nearly lh cables southward of the southernmost of these beacons when entering the harbour ; there is also a narrow channel between the north end of the bar and Toldbodn\u00e6s (Custom House point), but it can only be used, even at high water, by vessels of moderate draught. The eastern shore of TromsS-sund is shoal a short distance off shore ; and the bight north of Storsten-n\u00e6s is nearly dry at low water. In TromsS-sund, which is protected from sea winds by the high land of KvalS, there are 10 to 12 fathoms, at 2 or 3 cables southward of the harbour bar, over good holding ground consisting of firm sand ; and there is also good anchorage north-eastward of Toldbodn\u00e6s. In the whole of TromsS-sund, and past the bar as far as the middle of the harbour, the tidal streams are very strong, therefore it is generally necessary to run out hawsers to one of the buoys. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at TromsS at lh. 45m.*; springs rise 8 to 9 feet ; ordinary rise about 5 feet. The flood runs southward through TromsS-sund from Kval-sund, until three hours after high water, when the ebb sets northward, until three hours after low ater ; if, therefore, southward bound vessels get under-weigh from TromsS two hours after high water, the remainder of the ebb will carry them through Ry StrSmmen and Malang fiord; Gi-sund will .probably be reached by the time it is low water, and the flood will then be favourable as far as Leikn\u00e6s. ENTRANCES. \u2014 The principal entrances to TromsS from the south ward are Vest fiord, And fiord, and Malang fiord. The best northern entrance is that to the eastward of Inderbofaldet; there are several entrances between that and Malang fiord, but they are all more or less intricate and dangerous, ami should not be taken without a pilot, except in fine clear weather, or in case of emergency. COAST. VESTERAALEN.\u2014 The coast of Vesteraalen, like that of Lofoten, is dangerous of approach, and should be avoided, Hassel fiord being prac tically the only place of refuge between Vest VaagS and Anden\u00e6s. *From\" Den Norske Lods,\" Vol. VIII., 1870. In the Norwegian Almanac, lh. 14m. is given as the average time of high water, full and change, at Tromso."], [375, "357 CHAP. XV.] TROMSO \u2014 GENERAL REMARKS. ASPECT. \u2014 The mountains of Lofoten and Vesteraalen are steep and lofty, often covered with snow, and on the whole easily recognised ; they may be seen at a distance of 40 to 50 miles. When approaching Vesteraalen from the south-westward, several prominent mountains will be visible in clear weather. Himmeltinderne, two conical peaks on the west side of Vest VaagS, attain an elevation of about 3,000 feet, and rise higher than the other mountains of Lofoten. MS Sadlen on HindS, about 3,500 feet high, is always covered with snow, and when bearing S.E. the summit appears nearly flat, with two almost perpendicular peaks, on which the snow cannot lie, to the southward. In clear weather MS Sadlen will be seen as soon as the Lofotens, although it is so much farther inland. On nearing the coast the sharp hills ou the small island Gauk V\u00e6ro, and those near Nykvaag, 10 miles to the northward, will appear to stand out from LangS. Haarkallen or Staven is a sharp isolated peak on the north side of Eids fiord, and northward of Haarkallen is a nearly flat ridge with seven small rounded knolls, named Boina or BSrnene (the Children) ; with these exceptions, the mountains on LangS are too much alike to present any con spicuous landmarks when seen from a distance ; the openings of the fiords will, however, be recognised without difficulty. From Westward of LangS, the Lofotens will be visible in clear weather, and the broad opening that forms the entrance to Hassel fiord and Eids fiord will appear like a deep bay, with the mountains of HasselS near the middle, and those at B6 to the northward ; Gauk V\u00e6rS will show out against the latter, and MS Sadlen will be visible over them. From BSfjeld, a chain of sharp peaks extends northward to Maln\u00e6stind, which forms a projecting and almost perpendicular point. Aasen or Vikan-axlen is a high bold headland 6 miles northward of Gauk V\u00e6rS ; Skaarvaagfjeld is much lower. Northward of Maln\u00e6stind land may be seen indistinctly as far as Langen\u00e6s, and if the weather is very clear the mountains on AndS will possibly be visible. From a position westward of AndS, the high and strongly marked mountains on that island will be easily recognised, as they rise abruptly from low marshy lands of considerable extent, and from a distance appear like detached rocky islands ; in clear weather they are visible 40 or 50 miles. The mountains on the northern part of AndS are separated from Okla and the Bora and Bjornskind fjelds by the Dverberg marshes, which cannot be seen beyond 8 miles ; sometimes, however, the peaks on SenjenS will be visible over them. Between Bjornskind and Orkleven the land is also very low, and Langen\u00e6s stands out distinctly against it. Klotinden 4 miles southward of Langen\u00e6s, is the highest peak on the north end of LangS ; it assumes a sharply pointed appearance when brought to bear southward of East, and is then an excellent landmark. Myrtinden, between"], [376, "358 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. xv. 2 and 3 miles southward of Klotinden, Hornet, with its peaks inclining towards the north, and the deeply indented summit of SkogsS, are also noticeable objects. DyrStind and Tindstinden, south-westward of SkogsS, stand out distinctly like two sugar-loaves, and the promontory between the MSkland and Maln\u00e6s fiords has the appearance of a steep rocky island. Aasenaxlen and Skaarvaagfjeld will be merged and indistinct ; the small peak of Gauk V\u00e6rS will be just visible above the horizon at a distance of about 30 miles, and if the weather is sufficiently clear, the snow clad summits of Madmoderen, Vaagekallen, Kvaln\u00e6saxlen, and Himmeltinderne, will be seen faintly to the southward. HAVBRO. \u2014 The Havbro-Sea-bridge is a bank about which very little reliable information has yet been obtained ; southward of Lofoten, where its distance from the outer \"skjergaard\" is supposed to vary from 30 to 40 and 50 miles, and [its breadth from 8 to 16 miles, it is nowhere dangerous to navigation, having a depth of 60 to 80 fathoms on the shoalest parts known ; but off the coast of Lofoten and Vesteraalen, where it approaches the outer islands to within a distance of 5 miles, and in some places rises so high that the sea might break on it, a knowledge of its depth and extent becomes of great importance. From Lofotodden to Hassel fiord, a sandbank, on which there are numerous rocks and shoal spots, extends almost without interruption from one to 5 miles from the coast of Lofoten ; beyond this bank the depth increases so rapidly that there is no bottom at 80 fathoms, except on the edge or slope of the shoal ground, until, at a considerable distance from the coast another bank is met with, which is probalby a continuation of the Havbro to the southward. This bank approaches the south-western rocks of the RSst group to a distance of little more than 4 miles ; farther north it retires from the coast of Lofoten and Vesteraalen to a distance of from 16 to 24 miles, and again runs in to within a few miles of the coast of LangS ; here its breadth increases considerably, and it is divided into numerous branches or ridges, on some of which there are only from 20 to 30 and 40 fathoms. Andersboskallen, Torfindskallen, Klakken, Gjeineggen, and Sortskallen may be considered as elevations of the same bank. ANDERSBOSKALLEN lies about W.N.W. 19 miles from Skaar vaagfjeld, with MS Sadlen, bearing S.E. by E. \\ E., and the Western Himmeltind, bearing about S. by W. ; it is divided into two parts, SSrskallen and Nordskallen ; the marks for the latter are Haarkallen on LangS, visible over Gustad Kleveu, a hill near Aasen fiord, and Ongstad nyken on UlvS, just south of the highest peak on Gauk V\u00e6rS. On SSrskallen the fishermen report a depth of 24 fathoms, but 32 fathoms was the least depth found by the surveying officers ; the ground is tolerably level, and there is no danger in passing over it."], [377, "359 CHAP. XV.] HAVBRO BANK. Nordskallen is composed of uneven rocky ground, with small patches of brown and yellowish sand, shells, and coral ; it is very steep towards the west and north-west, and probably breaks with a heavy swell from those quarters. For a distance of about 7 miles south-eastward of Nordskallen Hie depth varies between 50 and 60 fathoms over hard ground, with patches of yellow and brown sand, broken shells, and coral ; it then increases gradually to the eastward, and past the eastern edge of the Havbro there is no bottom at 180 and 200 fathoms up to the western edge of the so-termed land bank. According to the fishermen there are only 16 fathoms on Nordskallen, but the least depth found was 24 fathoms ; as the bottom is very irregular it is nevertheless possible that a single peak may rise to within 18 fathoms of the surface, and if so it would be by no means safe to pass over it with a heavy westerly swell, which would raise a high topping sea, even if it did not break ; rollers set in towards Andersboskallen from a long distance to the westward. On comparing the configuration of Andersboskallen with that of the coast, it seems probable that it forms part of the outer edge of Havbro, and that the great ocean depths are not far to the westward. The large flocks of sea birds which assemble over the shoals of coal fish on Anders boskallen, and which led to its discovery, are never seen anywhere else on this part of the Havbro, as they would be on equally shoal ground ; it is therefore almost certain that this is the only outlying shoal off Lofoten and Vesteraalen that can be considered dangerous. Torfindskallen, Klakken, and Gjeineggen lie nearly in line with each other, with the south-western high peak on SkogsS bearing about S.E. a. S., and as already observed' must be considered as belonging to the Havbro ; as Torfindskallen is on the inner edge of the bank, while Klakken and Gjeineggen are probably on the outer part, it is here about 9 miles broad, and approaches the shoal ground off LangS to within 3 miles. Torfindskallen is rocky, and carries 41 fathoms ; there are 60 to 70 fathoms on Klakken, and 75 to 80 fathoms on Gjeineggen. On the Havbro itself there are here about 50 fathoms, but it is intersected by channels or gullies, in some of which the depth is much greater. SORTSKALLEN. \u2014 The southern and shoalest part of Sortskallen lies about N.W. 12 miles from Gjetbjerget on Langen\u00e6s ; the reported depth on it was from 42 to 46 fathoms, but not less than 47 fathoms were sound ; the bottom is generally rocky. CURRENT on the HAVBRO.\u2014 On the whole of the Havbro, northward of a position about 10 miles south-west of Andersboskallen, a strong current runs to the north-eastward and eastward, often attaining a velocity of 4 knots over the shoalest places, where the sea is consequently very high ; the velocity of the current increases steadily to the northward"], [378, "360 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. but depends very much on the wind. The Havbro is here so near the coast that the regular tides have some influence on the current, but the only perceptible effect is that it runs more slowly to the northward during the ebb. On the whole there is scarcely any place off the coast of Norway where the current is so strong as between the Lofotens and AndS. HASSEL FIORD.\u2014 The harbours at the inner end of Hassel fiord might be of considerable importance to vessels embayed between West VaagS and LangS. The bearings of Madmoderen and Ongstadnyken will be the best guides for avoiding the dangers off GimsS-strom and UlvSholm. From Hassel fiord vessels might either proceed northward through Sort land-sund and Gavl fiord, or southward through Raft-sund, to Vest fiord, but it would be unadvisable to attempt GimsS-strSm, under almost any circumstances. Dangers Off GimSO-Strom. \u2014 The northernmost dangers off GimsS-strSm are Krogtindskallen and Tintorskallen. Krogtindskallen, on which there are 5 fathoms, lies 4^ miles from the north-west point of East VaagS, with the southern part of Madmoderen bearing S.E. J S., and Ongstadnyken bearing E. \\ N. Tintorskallen, which also carries 5 fathoms, lies about 2 miles south-westward of Krogtindskallen, with Madmoderen bearing S.E. \\ E., and Ongstadnykeu about E. by N. HavbO or Ulvofaldene, the southernmost dangers on the north side of the entrance to Hassel fiord, lie S.W. | W. about 1| miles from UlvS holm ; they dry at low water, but almost always break when covered : these rocks should be given a berth of at least one mile when there is a heavy sea from the westward. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Entering Hassel fiord from the southward or westward keep Himmeltinderne open westward of Kvaln\u00e6saxlcn until Ongstadnykeu bears East, or the south extreme of HasselS is in line with MS Sadlen bearing about E. \\ S. ; Madmoderen kept about S.S.E. will lead in from the northward. A vessel will be eastward of Krogtindskallen when the eastern extreme of the high island GimsS bears S. by W. \\ W., aud should then edge to the southward in order to give Havbo a good berth, proceeding in mid-channel between East VaagS and HasselS for the most convenient anchorage. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 The only secure harbours between Hassel fiord and Sortland-sund are HanS at the north end of Raft-sund, and RisS at the east end of BSrS-sund ; but small vessels might bring up in summer on the east sides of SelS and HoldS, and also at MelbS, on the south side of HasselS. Han6. \u2014 Entering HanS harbour from the westward, pass 2 or 3 cables northward of Ho holm, a rather large solitary islet nearly 4 miles south-"], [379, "361 CHAP. XV.] HASSEL FIORD \u2014 SORTLAND SUND. ward of Hassel church, and steer about S.E. by E. until the round black rock Stabben is recognised : having passed southward of Stabben and the rocks to the eastward, proceed through the sound south of BrotS, passing on either side of HanSholm, and bring up off the high holm eastward of the houses at HanS in 5 to 6 fathoms ; there is also anchorage farther in, but the inner part of the bight is bordered by shoal ground. Entering HanS harbour from Raft-sund, give the point on the south side of the entrance a fair berth, as a shoal runs off it. Only a few small stones of the Kjuklinger rocks, eastward of HanS, are visible at high water. At and near HanS are the following beacons : \u2014 Futhellen, entrance to HanS, marked by an iron pillar ; Brotoskjer \u2014 white stone beacon; Skallen, Brotholmsund \u2014 iron pole with cage ; and HanS-havn \u2014 white pole with wooden sphere. B6r6-SUnd. \u2014 At the east end of BSrS-sund, a narrow channel between HasselS and LangS, there is anchorage at RisS, Stokmarkn\u00e6s, and Bitterstad. The whole of BSrS-sund is navigable. J\u00e6ven or J\u00e6va, a small low island about 1| miles eastward of Hassel church, is distinguished by a black wooden beacon with red cage ; rocky ledges run nearly 3 cables off the north and south points of J\u00e6ven. The edge of Fruboen, a rocky ledge extending nearly 3 cables from Skagen, the point on the north side of the east entrance to BSrS-sund, is marked by three staff and broom beacons ; and there is a staff and broom on the shoal south-east of Frin\u00e6sodden, at the east end of BSrS. If intending to proceed for the anchorage at RisS from Hassel fiord, keep nearly in mid-channel between East VaagS and LangS until Hassel church bears N.N.E. ; pass eastward of IndbjSrskjer, a solitary rock off the south east side of HasselS, and steer so as to pass at least 3 cables eastward or westward of J\u00e6ven ; give the north-east side of RisS a berth of 2 cables, and bring up off the north-west side of that island in 4 fathoms over a good sandy bottom ; small vessels may anchor farther in. The harbour at Stok markn\u00e6s, where a fair is held, may be entered either from the eastward or westward. Entering BSrS-sund from the westward it is necessary to keep within three-quarters of a mile of the north side of HasselS in order to avoid the sunken rocks off SkjervS and the islets to the eastward ; MS Sadlen, kept well shut in with BSrS, will lead southward of these dangers. Near the west end of BSrS-sund there is a small harbour at Fladset, on the north side of HasselS. Sortland-SUnd, a beautiful channel between HindS and the south east side of LangS, connects Raft-sund and Hassel fiord with Gavl fiord and RisS-sund. Lotterbo is a sunken rock lying E. by N. half a mile from Lotterskjer ; a shoal extends about 2 cables from LangS between BS and"], [380, "362 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. xv. SteirS, and the point southward of Sortland church is shoal nearly 4 cables off shore. V\u00e6rholmgrund, on the west side of the north entrance to Sort land-sund, is marked by an iron pole. Vessels may bring up almost any where in Sortland-sund, but the best ground is southward of Fiskholm ; the cove at Kvitn\u00e6s is very small, and is difficult to leave with northerly winds. BETWEEN HAVBO and Gauk V\u00e6ro.\u2014 Iu thick and stormy weather it might happen that a vessel running for Hassel fiord might miss the entrance by keeping too far to the northward, and be compelled to stand in between Havbo and Gauk V\u00e6rS ; in that case she might either run into BSrS-sund as already directed, or seek shelter at LilleS, Stene, or Guvaag ; but, if the weather permits, it would be advisable to heave-to off the north-west side of HasselS for a pilot, taking care to avoid the rocks off LangS and SkjervS. If uncertain as to position, the peak on Gauk V\u00e6rS, MS Sadlen, and the openings of BSrS-sund and the inlets on the north side of Eids fiord, might serve as landmarks. Lilleo, or Lille V\u00e6ro, has a flat summit, and is lower than Gauk V\u00e6rS, which is steep and sharp. The approach to the anchorage is easy, a vessel having only to pass southward and eastward of all the visible rocks lying south-west of Lille V\u00e6rS at a prudent distance, and bring up off the entrance to the small bight east of the house. If there is no pilot on board it will be easier to make Lille V\u00e6rS than Stene. Stene. \u2014 The entrance to Stene is between the two islands named Jerme sSerne or JersSer. It is necessary to pass close to the east side of the small round black rock south of the Western JersS, in order to avoid a sunken rock to the eastward ; and the anchor should be let go southward of the warehouses, the whole of the bight farther in being shoal. Kvalbakken is marked by an iron pillar. There is also anchorage at Venje, westward of Stene, but the entrance is difficult. On Venjeodden is a black stone beacon with triangle. Guvaag, between the two western inlets on the north side of Eids fiord, would afford good shelter to vessels of moderate size; there are 10 fathoms in the entrance, and 4 fathoms farther in. When entering Eids fiord a vessel should keep nearly in mid-channel till eastward of the isolated rock JSrgenfiordfl\u00e6sen, when the entrance to Guvaag, between a high woody islet and some houses to the eastward, will be seen ahead ; the anchor may be let go either eastward of the islet or farther in. WEST COAST Of LANGO.\u2014 The west coast of Lango is everywhere fronted by rocks and shoals, and the few channels between them are narrow and dangerous. Northward of Maln\u00e6s the island is intersected by long and narrow fiords, the entrances to which are obstructed by islets, rocks, and shoals; on some ofthe latter the depth is considerable"], [381, "LILLEO \u2014 PR\u00c6ST FIORD. 363 CHAP. xv.J but as they are exposed to the full force of the open sea, it is dangerous to pass over them even in tolerably fine weather, therefore only the utmost necessity would justify strangers in resorting to this part of the coast for shelter. The best landmarks in clear weather are the mountains on Lauge n\u00e6s, which stand out distinctly against AndS, and the peak on Gauk V\u00e6rS, for as the mountains on the islands nearest the coast are generally high and conical, it is difficult to distinguish them from those to the eastward until quite near the land. At cape Delpen, north-eastward of the entrance to Pr\u00e6st fiord, there are three small sharp peaks of considerable height. Tindstinden, DyrStind, and the most notable peaks on LangS, have already been described. Tides and Current. \u2014 At some distance from the coast of LangS the current runs to the northward as on the Havbro ; but nearer the land, and between the islands and rocks, the flood stream sets northward and the ebb southward, the streams turning irregularly, either before or after high and low water, at different places. Skaarvaag. \u2014 Between LilleS and Maln\u00e6s, the coast is almost inac cessible from seaward. There is a good small harbour in Skaarvaag, about 3 miles northward of Gauk V\u00e6rS, but there is difficulty in leaving it unless the wind is north-easterly. The pilot for this part of the coast lives on SvinS, eastward of Gauk V\u00e6rS. Pr\u00e6st Fiord. \u2014 About 4 miles northward of Maln\u00e6s there is a channel leading in southward of SkogsS, but it is foul and difficult ; Pr\u00e6st fiord, the sound on the east side of SkogsS, is easier. By bearings of Langen\u00e6s and the three conical peaks at Delpen, it will be easy to make out Nord voren, which lies one mile northward of GaasS ; Anv\u00e6rboerne extend three quarters of a mile from Klotinden, and Teisten, which nearly always breaks, lies about 8 cables westward of Krogn\u00e6s. Entering Pr\u00e6st fiord from the northward, pass 3 or 4 cables eastward of Nordvoren, and steer so as to pass within 4 cables of the east side of GaasS and the rocks to the southward, in order to avoid Anv\u00e6rboerne. When past the rocks south of GaasS, edge to the eastward to avoid Teisten, and steer for the north-east side of SkogsS. If the wind is westerly a vessel may bring up in smooth water off the east side of SkogsS westward of the small and very low islet J\u00e6va, which lies about 6 cables eastward of Frivaag ; but with northerly winds it will probably be necessary to run on to Oxn\u00e6s church taking care to avoid a shoal lying 2 cables E.N.E. of the houses at Fjeldo-rimstad. A pilot may be obtained at Oxn\u00e6s who will take the vessel to Bredstrand if the weather permits ; but southward of SkogsS the channel is foul, and the wind variable. Svartboria, at Bredstrand, is marked by an iron pillar."], [382, "364 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [CHAP. XV. North-westerly winds fall calm at Bredstrand, and when the wind is south-easterly or southerly it will blow fresh from the northward at Bred strand and Oxn\u00e6s, and fall quite calm northward of Maln\u00e6s. Langen\u00e6s. \u2014 Vessels bound to the southward and meeting with south-westerly winds off the coast of AndS will find it difficult to proceed on account of the strong current ; under these circumstances the small harbours north of Langen\u00e6s church and farther to the westward at StS might possibly be useful, but they should not be attempted without a pilot. A vessel should therefore stand off and on to the westward of the large grassy islet An den, which, with the low rocks Fl\u00e6sa and Brakan, will be easily recognised; the shoals off Langen\u00e6s will be avoided by keeping cape Delpen bearing southward of S.W. by S. During northerly gales a swell is felt in the harbours at Langen\u00e6s, but they are nevertheless preferable to those in Pr\u00e6st fiord, from which it is difficult to put to sea on account of the irregularity of the wind. GAVL FIORD, which separates LangS from Ando and HindS, is connected with Hassel fiord by Sortland-sund, and is the only entrance between Langen\u00e6s and Anden\u00e6s, the whole of the west side of AndS being quite inaccessible. If bound to Hassel fiord or Lofoten from the north ward, vessels of the larger class should pass well westward of LangS, as the northern entrance to Gavl fiord is very difficult, especially if the weather is thick or stormy, and should not be attempted by strangers unless they have first obtained a pilot, from Anden\u00e6s or some place south ward of Langen\u00e6s. If driven in between Langen\u00e6s and AndS during a north-westerly gale, the safety of a vessel will depend on a sharp look-out and attention to the chart and directions, as under these circumstances probably no boat would be able to get off. DANGERS. \u2014 Fl\u00e6sa and Brakan, though very low, will be easily recognised ; they break constantly and are the northernmost rocks oft Langen\u00e6s and Anden. A reef extends 1^ miles south-westward from Fl\u00e6sa. A rocky ledge, on the outer part of which there are from 1 2 to 20 fathoms, extends 2 miles in a north-easterly direction from the northernmost islets off GisselS. On the opposite side of the channel a sandbank, carrying from 10 to 20 fathoms, extends from half a mile to a mile off the west coast of AndS. The passage between the reef and bank is only three-quarters of a mile broad, and there is such a heavy swell across the whole of this space during northerly gales, that it appears to be quite impassable. Mev\u00e6r, one of the northernmost islets off the north side of GisselS is marked by a stone beacon, and there is a white wooden beacon with a black top on Sandholm."], [383, "LANGEN\u00c6S \u2014 RISO SUND. 365 CHAP. XV.] DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When approaching the entrance to Gavl fiord from the westward and northward, there will be no difficulty in recog nising Langen\u00e6s, which is high, and steep towards the sea ; the lofty pointed summit of BjSrnskindfjeld on AndS is also a good landmark. Having passed northward of Brakan, or between that and Fl\u00e6sa, a vessel may steer for the north-western part of Orkleven, on a S.S.E. bearing, until within about 2 miles of AndS. Sandn\u00e6s, a projecting point near the south end of AndS, bearing S. W., or Bremn\u00e6s bearing S. f W., will then lead between the reef and bank at the northern entrance to Gavl fiord. If neither of these points can be distinguished, the projecting point at Aaken\u00e6s, south-westward of Orkleven, may be kept bearing South until BjSrnskindfjeld bears E. | S., or Langen\u00e6s bears W. by N. | N. A vessel will then be about half-way between the reef and bank, and should steer so as to pass at least half a mile westward of Aaken\u00e6s. When southward of the rocks off the latter point, it is only necessary to pass the visible rocks between GisselS and Bremn\u00e6s at a prudent distance, and to avoid the shoals extending nearly half a mile from the land north of Gaas fiord and Rensn\u00e6sS. Having once entered Gavl fiord, a vessel may either proceed through Sortland-sund, or seek an anchorage. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Alsvaag is the best harbour in Gavl fiord, but the entrance is not easy for strangers. A shoal runs off the point on the south side of the harbour, but it dries at low water, and is marked by an iron pillar. If wishing to enter Alsvaag from the northward, steer S. by W. westerly from Aaken\u00e6s until the low rocks Skibleiskjerene are on the starboard beam ; pass a good cable eastward of these rocks, proceed between the Gr\u00e6sholms and IndstS, keeping about one cable from the land on the north side of the entrance to the harbour, in order to avoid the shoal to the southward, and bring up off the merchants' houses in 5 to 8 fathoms over sand and clay. To make Alsvaag from the southward, give the Bremn\u00e6s holms a berth of at least 2 cables, and proceed either between Holmsklubben, (a little round hillock on the south side of Li fiord), and Troldskjer, or between that rock and LyngS. Give the west sides of LyngS and Mas-skjer. a good berth, in order to avoid the shoal ground between them, and do not haul in for the harbour until within one cable of IndstS. Indifferent anchorage may be found at SkjSIhavn, on the west side of the entrance to RisS-sund ; southward of the shoal extending about 3 cables from the south side of Bremn\u00e6s holm ; and also on the east and south sides of Rensn\u00e6sS. Ris6-SUnd, between HindS and AndS, becomes more shallow every year, and eastward of the trading station Risohavn the depth at low water is now only 3 or 4 feet. ,"], [384, "366 VEST NAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. ANDEN\u00c6S, the northernmost point of AndS and Nordland, is a celebrated fishing station, and important landfall. When approaching Anden\u00e6s from the westward, the mountains on AndS and LangS, will be sighted long before those to the eastward are visible. RSiken, which forms the northern termination of the high land on AndS, rises to the height of 1,483 feet above the level of the sea,* and is steep towards the north and west. From the foot of RSiken a low sandy flat extends, about 3 miles to the north-eastward, and from the western edge of this flat, about half-way between RSiken and Anden\u00e6s lighthouse, a rock named Anden\u00e6s M\u00e6rket or Beacon, which at a distance of 8 or 10 miles has the appearance of a small round hummcck, rises almost perpen dicularly to a height of about 200 feet. When RSiken bears between East and S. by E., the \" Beacon \" appears detached ; but on all other bearings from seaward it closes with the high land to the southward, and cannot well be distinguished. 'The church and houses on Anden\u00e6s will not be seen from the deck beyond a distance of 4 or 5 miles ; but the lighthouse, a red circular iron tower 1 17 feet high, is an excellent landmark. On SenjenS, which lies 16 miles eastward of AndS, there are several remarkable mountains and headlands ; Kv\u00e6rnen, with its sharp peaks and patches of snow ; the round white summit of Snefjeld ; and the steep pro jecting points Kj\u00e6rringn\u00e6s, Teisten, Tr\u00e6llen, and Oxen, are all good land marks ; but KjSlva peak, which forms the northern extreme of the island, is especially prominent, and from a position north-westward of Anden\u00e6s can hardly be mistaken. LIGHT. \u2014 From Anden\u00e6s lighthouse, which stands on the north ex treme of the point, a fixed white light, varied by a flash every third minute, is exhibited, at an elevation of 128 feet, from the 15th of August to the 30th of April. The light should be visible in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. Pilots may be obtained at Anden\u00e6s, but they will not be able to come off during gales from the northward and westward. BANK OFF ANDO.\u2014 As already observed, the whole of the west coast of AndS is inaccessible, being skirted by a bank of white sand, on which there are numerous rocks above and below water. Northward of BSra this bank carries a depth of from one to 4 fathoms, and extends from 2 to 3^ miles off the west coast of AndS and nearly 5 miles north ward from Anden\u00e6s, the general direction of its western edge beino north-easterly; on the east side of AndS it does not extend more than a mile from the shore. * According to the measurement of Professor Keilhau."], [385, "367 CHAP. XV.] ANDEN\u00c6S \u2014 AND EIORD. Owing to the frequency of westerly and north-westerly gales on this part of the coast, vessels making Anden\u00e6s from the southward should stand well to the northward before closing the land, so that in case of being obliged to enter And fiord, they will be able to pass 8 or 10 miles northward of RSiken and Anden\u00e6s lighthouse, in order to clear the shoals on the northern extreme of the bank off AndS ; there is no passage south ward of these shoals, aud although they carry 4 to 5 fathoms they break heavily, and are dangerous to vessels of every class. ANDEN\u00c6S ROAD. \u2014 There is no harbour on either side of AndS ; but vessels in want of a pilot may bring up in the roadstead on the east side of Anden\u00e6s, in from 8 to 16 fathoms over fine white sand. The snowy summit of Barstind, kept just northward of Maan\u00e6s, bearing E. by S. \u00a3 S., will lead about one mile northward of all the shoals off An den\u00e6s, and when the lighthouse bears S.W. by S. course may be altered to pass at least a mile eastward of Fl\u00e6sene, the north-eastern rocks above water off Anden\u00e6s. With northerly winds vessels should anchor well out from the bank off AndS in from 12 to 14 or 16 fathoms, so that there may be no difficulty in getting under weigh ; but if the wind is westerly they may bring up about IA miles from the shore in 10 fathoms, with the light house bearing about N.W. W. and Haugn\u00e6s about S. by W. BSringen, one ofthe numerous rocks off Anden\u00e6s, is marked by an iron pole ; and there is also an iron pole at the entrance to the boat harbour. AND FIORD, the large inlet between AndS and SenjenS, extends about 25 miles to the southward from the west side of GrytS under the name of Kv\u00e6 fiord, the inner part of which, Guiles fiord, penetrates so far into HindS that it is only separated from Kanstad fiord and Vest fiord by a low isthmus 4 miles broad. On the east side of And fiord there are several groups of low islands, surrounded by rocks and shoals ; the west side is clear outside of the bank off AndS, with the exception of the shoals between Dverberg aud Myrefl\u00e6sene, a small cluster of rocks 2 miles S.E. of Dverberg church. And fiord is connected with Vaags fiord and the Inner Lead by Top sund and the channel between MelSv\u00e6r and Steinav\u00e6r ; it is however but little frequented, except by small coasters, as the larger class of vessels, when bound to Vesteraalen and North Lofoten fron the northward, almost always pass westward of AndS and LangS. Top-sund is exposed to heavy and baffling squalls, and it is difficult to find anchorage there without a pilot. The passage between MelSv\u00e6r and Steinav\u00e6r is preferable to that through Top-sund, but a pilot should be obtained from Anden\u00e6s before taking it, as there are several shoals and low rocks that would be dangerous to strangers, especially in thick or hazy weather, and the harbours between Anden\u00e6s and TiStS are only suitable for small vessels. If the wind is fair"], [386, "368 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. xv. for entering Aud fiord, it will probably be accompanied by rain and fog ; while south-westerly aud southerly winds, which are compressed between the mountains on AndS, and blow from the westward across the Dverberg marshes, fall so light towards MelSv\u00e6r that it is difficult to proceed. Easterly winds generally blow fresh off the land and bring clear weather, but are foul nearly the whole way from Anden\u00e6s to Vaags fiord. On the whole then it cannot be considered advisable for northward bound vessels to enter And fiord unless a north-westerly gale is coming on, and they cannot weather SenjenS ; under all other circumstances Malang fiord is the best and shortest entrance to TrSmsS from seaward. Vessels bound to the southward, and encountering a south-westerly gale off Anden\u00e6s. might however find it convenient to put into Anden\u00e6s road, after which they must be guided by circumstances. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The entrance to And fiord is broad and clear, but it is necessarv to keep within about 7 miles of the east side of AndS, taking care at the same time not to approach it nearer than 1^ miles until past Mybro, as sunken rocks extend about 2 miles W.N.W., and West from the high islet Orja, and there are numerous rocks to the north-westward of Steinav\u00e6r. There is a harbour about 1^ miles northward of Orja, but it is very small, and the entrance is extremely narrow. Myrbo is the western shoal off Steinav\u00e6r ; it dries at low water, and nearly always breaks. If obliged to proceed through And fiord from Myrbo without a pilot, a vessel should, if possible, stand towards MelSv\u00e6r and endeavour to pick up a fisherman. There are several harbours near MelSv\u00e6r, but with the exception of that in Symsvoldsund, where there is good anchorage for vessels of moderate size, they are only suitable for small craft ; a rock in Symsvoldsund is marked by an iron pole. Failing to obtain a pilot at MelSv\u00e6r, it is advisable to continue under easy sail past the west side of the Froholms, which will be recognised by some fishing huts on the highest part of the middle and largest islet, and when past the southernmost rock of the group, course ma}' be altered, either for Symsvoldsund, GrytSv\u00e6r, or Top-sund ; Ausa rock in GrytShavn is marked by au iron pole. Between Melov\u00e6r and Steinav\u00e6r. \u2014 After passing Myrbo, vessels taking the passage between MelSv\u00e6r and Steinav\u00e6r should keep as nearly as possible in mid-channel between those groups, and endeavour to make the small and very low rocks, Fl\u00e6sene, the southernmost of which should be given a berth of nearly half a mile in order to avoid a shoal carrying 2 fathoms. Fladfl\u00e6sa is marked by an iron pillar. Having passed between Fl\u00e6sene and Kalten rock, the shoals extending nearly a mile from the south-west part of Senjehesten will be cleared by keepino over towards the round black rock Tr\u00e6lskjer, which though small is isolated"], [387, "CHAP. XV.] 369 AND PIORD \u2014 KV\u00c6 FIORD. and conspicuous ; the western islet of Lemmingv\u00e6r should be given a berth of at least one mile, and course may then be altered to proceed as requisite through Vaags fiord. Top-sund. \u2014 Entering Top-sund from And fiord it is advisable to give the western islets of GrytSv\u00e6r a berth of nearly 2 miles, in order to clear the off-lying rocks. TjeS, a rather high islet at the south-east end of Top-sund, kept nearly its own width open north and east of Elsn\u00e6s, will lead north-eastward of Skarvhausbo and the other shoals south -westward of GrytSv\u00e6r, which only carry 3 to 4 fathoms, but seldom break. Hestebo, which lies 3 cables northward of Elsn\u00e6s, and dries at low water, is the only dangerous shoal in Top-sund, but, as before mentioned, heavy and baffling squalls may be expected off the mountains on GrytS, the height of which is estimated at about 4,000 feet. As both shores of Top-sund are inhabited, there will be no difficulty in obtaining a pilot capable of taking a vessel through Vaags fiord and Tiel-sund. The eastern entrance to Top sund has already been described, see page 347. Kv\u00e6 Fiord. \u2014 There is no harbour in any part of Kv\u00e6 fiord, and the anchorages on the east side of GapS, and at the south-east end of Kv\u00e6S are so much exposed to southerly and easterly winds, that they should only be resorted to when absolutely necessary. ANDEN\u00c6S to NORTH KVALO.\u2014 The coast from Anden\u00e6s to North KvalS, like that to the southward, is fronted by a range of large islands with abrupt declivities towards the sea ; these again are fronted by a \" skergaard \" from 5 to 10 miles deep, the outer boundary of which trende generally in a north-easterly direction from the western extreme of SenjenS. This part of the coast is of considerable importance, as it includes several entrances to TromsS, as well as to the extensive fiords which penetrate the mainland. It is also important to Archangel traders, as these vessels frequently approach the outer islands in order to get a correct departure, or are driven in by north-westerly gales. Here also is the northern termination of that range of islets and rocks that forms one of the most distinctive features of the western coast of Norway ; eastward of North KvalS, though the mainland is still partially protected by islands for a considerable distance, there is, properly speaking, no \" skjergaard.\" Of the various entrances from seaward, Malang fiord, VengsS ' deep, and the entrance north of South FuglS, are the only channels that can be safely taken by strangers, even in fine weather, without a pilot ; therefore, owing to the prevalence of fogs and north-westerly gales, and the distance to which the \" skjergaard \" extends from the outer islands, it is recommended that vessels bound to Kaa fiord, Hammerfest, or round the North Cape, should give this part of the coast a wide berth, and make the land to the eastward of North Kvalo. K 740. A A"], [388, "370 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [CHAP. XV. Tides. \u2014 The tidal streams on this part of the coast are irregular, and depend very much upon local conditions ; as a general rule, the flood sets northward and the ebb southward, both on the Havbro bank, and near the outer islands, while in the various fiords and sounds between SenjenS and North KvalS, the flood sets in direct from seaward, following the direction of the channels, and the ebb ruus out, the streams turning at nigh and low water. The \"ordinary rise and fall is about 5 feet. Springs rise 8 to 9 feet. HAVBRO BANK. \u2014 Northward of SenjenS, the Havbro, ap proaches several parts of the coast to within 'a few miles of the \" skjer gaard,\" and a little northward of Utv\u00e6r, is only one mile distant from the outer shoals. It is not improbable that the elevations of the sea bottom off LangS and Utv\u00e6r have no connexion with each other, but that the bank off LangS stretches to the northward at some distance from the coast, while that off Utv\u00e6r is merely an extension of the ridge that forms AndS and the fishing grounds off Anden\u00e6s. Situated as these banks are, in many places at a considerable distance from the coast, and in a sea frequently disturbed by storms, it is not surprising that they are but little known to the fishermen. It is supposed, however, that the Havbro fishery was formerly much more extensive than at present, and that the men engaged in it were acquainted with many good fishing grounds, which, though traditionally known to the present generation, have never been visited by them ; amongst these may be instanced the banks^off RSst and Gank V\u00e6rS, and the so-termed Seitarre off Malangen. This fishery is uow carried on much nearer the coast, and only at particular places, but it would probably be pursued with more vigour if the bank was better known ; the principal fishing stations are B6 at the south end of LangS ; Oxn\u00e6s on SkogsS ; Anden\u00e6s ; the Torsken and Bergs fiords on the west side of SenjenS ; and Utv\u00e6r. The accounts of the ancient fishing grounds are mea\u00b0re and untrustworthy ; and, indeed, all the information that has been obtained respecting the Havbro, on this as on other parts of the coast, is very unsatisfactory, and refers only to some of the most noticeable points ; still is it considered worthy of attention, and the bank has been laid down on the chart in accordance with it. The following are the principal statements of several experienced fisher men : \u2014 \" West and north of Utv\u00e6r the Harbro is as flat as a table, with \" a depth of 40 fathoms,* but on going south and west towards the outer * This depth was measured with two droppers, which are usually cut off in 18 fathom lengths, and therefore should not exceed 36 fathoms ; but as the bank is not uniformly level, the average depth may be estimated at between 30 and 40 fathoms as marked on the chart."], [389, "CHAP. XV.] 371 HAVBRO BANK. \" edge there are 60 fathoms ; on the edge itself, which descends abruptly, \" there are 180 fathoms, and in many places there is no bottom at that depth. The inner edge runs exactly in line with the inner slope of South FuglS kept a door's breadth open westward of RSdeggen, the \" north point of GrStS. The bottom consists of light sand and pulverised \" coral.\" \" South FuglS in line with Mulen, and RisS with Bispenaava (the edge \" of Skarstensfjeld), gives 40 fathoms.\" \" On Utv\u00e6r Havbro, South FuglS is in line with GrStS, and Bremn\u00e6s \" tinderne with Hoia.\" \" Northward of a line joining LyngS and Bispenaava, there are 40 \" fathoms eveiywhere on the Havbro until Trehorningen (a single peak \" of Mulen) is in line with the inner slope of FuglS ; RisS is then in line \" with Bjelkevik (south of Klokkerholm, which lies close to Skarstens \" fjeld).\" \" When westward and a little northward of FuglS, it necessary to \" keep well out (to the north-westward) to follow the inner edge of the \" Havbro, which here forms a large bight.\" \" Exactly on the inner edge lies Havbrobakken, a long sandbank with a \" depth of 16 fathoms, which never breaks ; Trehorningen on Mulen is \" then in line with the inner slope of FuglS, and [the cairn ou Sandv\u00e6r \" (near RisS) with Troldbotsnaava (the south-western point of Skarstens \" fjeld). The east side of Havbrobakken descends abruptly to a depth of \" about 100 fathoms.\" One of the most experienced Havbro fishermen of HelgS parish stated that on one occasion when, according to the usual custom, he had ascended a mountain during a winter storm with an unusually heavy sea, for the purpose of discovering unknown shallows, he observed a spot where the sea \" went,\" that is, rose high and blue, but did not break heavily, and concluded that it must be a long sandbank with shoal water. Seen from a considerable height this bank appeared to be just on the horizon, which convinced him that it formed part of the Havbro. The following summer, he proceeded to search for the spot in an open boat, and after finding 40 fathoms, the usual depth on the shoaler parts of the Havbro, he at length came to a place where the depth was only 30 fathoms ; but rowing to the northward until Brusen (the south point of North FuglS) was in line with Vandn\u00e6ringen, he again found 100 fathoms ; a north-westerly gale and thick fog then compelled him to return, and no further search was made. The following information may be accepted as tolerably reliable. West of Malang fiord the Havbro lies 4 to 8 miles from the outer edge of the \" skjergaard,\" but runs in much nearer towards Utv\u00e6r ; it is thus separated from the rocks and shoals off the coast by a channel varying in width, and a a 2"], [390, "372 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. generally over 100 fathoms deep. The assumed breadth of the bank is from 8 to 16 miles, and according to the unanimous statement of the fishermen it is \" flat as a table,\" with an average depth of 40 fathoms. The bottom consists of sand, and is partially covered with echini and their shells ; but in other places, where the fishermen positively assert that there are fresh water springs, it is clear and white, and large quantities of fish may be expected. The regularity of the bank is broken by slight elevations and hollows, and when the latter contain white sand, which denotes the exist ence of fresh water springs, they are considered the best fishing grounds of all ; such places are named \" Fiskeklakker,\" fish spots, and when discovered, their position is carefully fixed by cross marks. From South FuglS to VandS, eastward of North KvalS, there is no fishery, and nothing is known about the bank. CAUTION. \u2014 The foregoing remarks point to the conclusion that when approaching this part of the coast during thick weather the lead should be frequently used, and if after striking soundings in about 40 fathoms, a vessel should stand into much deeper water on an easterly course, she would probably be not far from the outer rocks, and might possibly be close to the shoals off Utv\u00e6r. LANDMARKS. \u2014 Strangers will have some difficulty in recognising this part of the coast from the offing. The highest visible mountains lie a considerable distance inland, and seldom exceed an elevation of 4,000 or 5,000 feet, while the islands occupying the foreground frequently rise to a height of 2,000 to 3,500 feet. When seen from a distance therefore, the mountains on the larger islands appear to diminish those in the back ground, and on a closer view, hide them, altogether. At a distance also the islands themselves lose the height and peculiarity of outline which they really possess, and appear to form a continuous mass, which is capped by so many sharp peaks, that considerable local knowledge is required to distin guish any one in particular with certainty. The most noticeable points are Anden\u00e6s, and the north extreme of North KvalS, both of which he so far from the inner coast that they stand out very distinctly against it; as a rule, however, the openings of the numerous fiords and sounds will prove the most useful guides. When nearing the land to the northward and westward of KjSlva, the opening of Oi fiord will be visible eastward of the snowy peaks of M\u00e6len. South-eastward of KjSlva are the conspicuous couical mountains Astrida, or Astria, and Skindkollen, which are most important marks for the entrance to Malang fiord ; they are separated by a deep valley, and are very steep towards the sea, with sharp summits.

Hoia, or HaaS, is distinguished from all the neighbouring islands and mountains by its height and precipitous descent towards the sea, and will be seen at the same time as the mountains on S\u00e6sS and the northern part of South KvalS. In clear weather the mountains on AndS will be visible to the southward, and land will be seen to the northward as far as Rebben\u00e6sS and South FuglS. If westward of the low islets and rocks of Utv\u00e6r, the Alp-like mountains on South KvalS, amongst which Bremn\u00e6stind, Skamtind, Tromtind, and Blaamanden are the most remarkable, the sharp lofty peak of VengsS, and the rounded snowy summit of Snefjeld or Nonstind, on RingvadsS,* form a background to Hoia, S\u00e6sS, and the lower islands Angstouren, BjSrnS, and RSsholm. The two highest peaks on AndS will still be above the horizon to the westward of SenjenS, while the irregular outline of Reb ben\u00e6sS, the lower and flatter island SandS ; and the sharp pyramidal peak of South FuglS, will be visible to the northward of Skarstensfjeld and SkagS-sund. On an easterly bearing, South FuglS assumes the appearance of an almost perfect pyramid ; but when seen from the northward or southward, it shows several smaller peaks, of which the southernmost appears to be quite isolated. When westward of South FuglS, the high, dark, and steep mountain Mulen, or Bredviks Mulen, on the northern part of Rebben\u00e6sS, stands boldly out ; and southward of Rebben\u00e6sS, Snefjeld and the jagged peaks Skulgamtinderne, on RingvadsS, which are almost always covered- with snow, are especially noticeable. If farther to the northward, GrStS, and the mountains Alangen and Rosmaalen on North KvalS, will be easily recognised ; and the small but high island HatS, with SandS and South FuglS, will be conspicuous to the north and west of Rebben\u00e6sS. The northernmost mountains on North KvalS and VandS fall almost perpendicularly towards the sea, and are distinguished from those to the southward by their slightly undulating summits ; the peaks of Alangen, on the contrary, are high and sharp, and their hollows are almost always filled with snow ; they are separated from the mountains to the northward by a deep valley, which, however, is only visible from a position westward of GrStS, whence the northern ridge of VandS may be seen through a similar valley on the south side of Rosmaalen. Between North KvalS and VandS is the smaller island HelgS, whose western steep peak is termed Hornet. * The glacier of Eingvadso has pushed before it at large moraine, which, extending quite to the sea-side, has dammed up a considerable valley, forming thereby a nearly circular piece of fresh water, from which the island takes its name.\u2014 \" Tracing of the North of Europe \" Chambers."], [392, "374 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. Senjeno. \u2014 Next to HindS, SenjenS is the largest island on the coast of Norway, and when viewed from the sea, its peaks, which strikingly resemble those of Arran, and like them are composed of granite, present a singularly wild and imposing appearance. A ridge from 2,000 to 3,000 feet high extends about N.E. and S.W. along the whole island, dividing it into two sections of very different character, the north and west sides being rugged and precipitous, while the south and east sides are characterised by rounded slopes, which are covered with luxuriant birch woods, interspersed with cultivated fields and thriving hamlets. The west and north coasts of SenjenS are indented by numerous inlets, which are separated by lateral spurs of the main ridge ; northward of Senjehesten these inlets will be found in the following order : \u2014 Sel fiord ; Si or Sild fiord, with its branches Gjiska and Medby fiord or Veimandsbotten ; Torsken fiord with its three branches, Oster fiord, Skibs fiord, and Grylle fiord ; Bergs fiord, which is connected with StrSmmen by a sound 70 yards broad, through which the tides run with great violence ; Stans (Steen) fiord and Ers fiord ; Me fiord ; Oi fiord ; Bals (Baltestad) fiord west of Hekkingen ; StSnn\u00e6sbotten ; and, lastly, Lysbotten on the west side of Gi-sund : most of these inlets are either directly exposed to the open sea, or are only partially sheltered by groups of small islets and rocks, which render the entrances dangerous. There is an anchorage south of Torsken church that may be entered with out much difficulty ; but, as a rule, all the [headlands between And fiord and Malang fiord should be given a berth of at least 5 or 6 miles. At Havn in Bergs fiord is a nickel mine, which, on account of the richness of the ore and the facility of transport arising from the imme diate vicinity of the sea, seems destined to become the most important in the Amt ; it has been for some years in the hands of an English company. MALANG FIORD.\u2014 Between the small islands Hekkingen and EdS is the entrance to Malang fiord, which first separates SenjenS and South KvalS, and then dividing into several branches penetrates about 20 miles inward, its greatest length being about 33 miles. Malang fiord must be considered the best entrance to TromsS for sailing vessels of the larger class, as it is not a difficult channel, and the distance from Kvalkjyvene to TromsS-sund is only 30 miles. DANGERS. \u2014 The most dangerous shoals off the entrance to Malang fiord are Kvalkjyvene, a cluster of sunken rocks on which the least water is from 3 to 3^ fathoms ; the eastern rock lies about N.N.W. 31 miles from Hekkingen lighthouse, with KjSlva bearing W. by S. f S. Shoal ground also extends between 3 and 4 miles in a north-westerly direction from Hekkingen."], [393, "CHAP.

Hekkingen light house, bearing S. f W. will lead westward of Aarsboen.* Rocks and shoals occupy the whole of the space between EdS and Kvit holm, but many of them are visible. Shoals extend about 3 cables off shore between Thorsn\u00e6s and Outer Buvik, and 6A cables between Inner Buvik and Sandvik ; the south side of South KvalS should nowhere be approached nearer than 3 cables, as in many places large boulders he some distance from the shore.

The bearing S. by E. \u00a7 E. leads eastward of Kvalkyvene. Beacon. \u2014 A stone beacon with a flat top stands on the highest part of Hekkingen, at an elevation of 265 feet. Pilots. \u2014 There is a pilot station on SommerS, and pilots may also be obtained from LSkvik. Tides. \u2014 During spring and the greater part of the summer a current always sets out of Malang fiord, independently of the tidal streams, which are then only perceptible near the shore, where they turn at high and low water as usual ; therefore, as sea winds generally fall light towards the coast, vessels should have boats ready for towing in case it should be neces sary. During the rest of the year the flood sets in from seaward, and the ebb runs out. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels bound into Malang fiord from the southward should keep westward of 10\u00b0 E. longitude until northward of the 68th parallel, in order to pass the west coast of Lofoten at a safe dis tance ; they may then steer more to the north-eastward, and endeavour to make Anden\u00e6s. When northward |of AndS, KjSlva and the headlands on the west coast of SenjenS, with Kv\u00e6rnen and Senjehesten, will be easily recognised, and course may be shaped to pass 5 or 6 miles northward of KjSlva. When Astria and Skindkollen are open eastward of M\u00e6len (the mountain south of KjSlva), there will be no difficulty in distinguishing Hek kingen and EdS, and course may then be altered to about E. by S. ; KjSlva should not, however, be brought to bear westward of S.W. by W. until the point at LSkvik, on the east side of Astria, is visible eastward of Hekkin gen, bearing about S. by E. \\ E. ; these marks will lead eastward of Kvalkjyvene up to the entrance to Malang fiord. * Norwegian Light list, 1880."], [394, "376 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. A vessel will be westward of the shoals off Hoia and EdS, as well as Aarsboen, as long as- Hekkingen beacon, or lighthouse, bears eastward of S.| W. Having passed Hekkingen and EddS at a prudent distance, it is only necessary to give the land on either side of Malang fiord a berth of about 3 cables, and to avoid the shoals between Thorsn\u00e6s and Sandvik, proceeding past Gi-sund for Ry StrSmmen and TromsS as directed (pages 352-354). ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Having entered Malang fiord vessels might bring up to wait wind or tide either between Store LyngS and Lille SommerS ; in LSkvik ; in Inner Buvik ; or off the shoal between Inner Buvik and Sandvik. To make the anchorage between Store LyngS and Lille SommerS, pass 2 or 3 cables south of EddS, and the same distance south and east of the small rock Kvalen, which lies S.E. by E. A. E. 7 cables from the south extreme of EddS ; then steer so as to pass about 1-A cables westward of Store LyngS, and bring up half-way between that island and the south west end of Lille SommerS, in 15 fathoms over clay. The anchorage is only 1^ cables broad, and it is not advisable to attempt it without a pilot. Small craft may pass southward of the islets east of Store LyngS, to the anchorage west of Varholm, which has a depth of 5 fathoms. In LSkvik, about 2A miles from Hekkingen lighthouse, and the same distance S.S.W. from the south point of EddS, anchorage may be found in from 15 to 19 fathoms, over sand and clay ; the bank is very steep to the eastward, but there is a ring for shore hawsers. The points north and south of LSkvik must be given a fair berth, and the cove south of the mooring ring is shoal to a distance of 1^ cables from the shore. About 2 cables from the shore at Inner Buvik, there are 15 and 10 fathoms over clay, and off the western edge of the shoal between Inner Buvik and Sandvik, there are 6 to 11 fathoms, over sand and large stones. Caution is necessary in taking up the latter anchorage, as the bank is very steep. Inner Malang.\u2014 The inner part of Malang fiord, with its three principal branches; Indre Malang, SSr or Aure fiord, and Nord fiord, is almost everywhere free from dangers to within 2 or 3 cables of the shore. RoksfiordstrSm, which connects Roksfiordvand with Malang fiord, is only navigable for boats. A shoal runs 41. cables off Spildern\u00e6s in a south-westerly direction, and shoal ground extends 3 cables northward, and 6 cables southward, from SpilderS. The inner parts of Indre Malang and Nord fiord are ob structed by alluvial banks of considerable extent, and the whole of the"], [395, "377 CHAP. XV.] MALANG FIORD \u2014 ERS FIORD DEEP. inner part of Malang fiord must be navigated with caution, on account of the sudden and baffling squalls to which it is exposed. There is anchorage west of Tendskjerholm, on the west side of the entrance to the inner part of Malang fiord, in about 8 fathoms over sand and clay ; vessels may also bring up northward of Roksfiordn\u00e6s in about 9 fathoms. In GjSvik and eastward of FurS, Spildern\u00e6s, and Spildero, there is indifferent anchorage for small craft. Indre Malang, the most important branch of Malang fiord, extends about 4 miles in a S.S.W. direction on the west side of Maalsn\u00e6s, a thickly wooded point 4 miles southward of Spildero.* At the inner end of this branch is the mouth of the Maals-elv, which, with the Rosta, Divi, and Bardo rivers, and numerous tributary streams forms the prin cipal watercourse in TromsS Amt. The Maals-elv is navigable for boats up to Malangsfos, a distance of about 15 miles, and j\u00e6gts ascend it as far as Brandskogn\u00e6s, about 3 miles below Malangsfos, for timber, fire wood, tar, birch-bark, &c. Above Malangsfos, (a fall 30 to 40 feet high), the upper part of the river is practicable for boats as far as Rosta-vand, a distance of nearly 25 miles. The Maals-elv is not highly spoken of as a salmon river, and the attempts made to lower the Malangsfos by mining, to facilitate the passage of timber rafts, and to allow the fish to run up, have, so far as the latter object is concerned, been attended with indifferent success. North of HilleSO.: \u2014 The first entrance from seaward, north of Malang fiord, is the narrow and difficult channel between the rocks off HillesS and TusS ; it should only be attempted by the larger class of vessels, when in distress and obliged to seek the nearest shelter, in which case they might find anchorage on the south side of TusS, in 5 fathoms, between the rock off the houses and the point to the westward, where there is a mooring ring. The passage from TusS to Malang fiord, eastward of HillesS, is extremely narrow and intricate. Ers fiord Dybet or Deep, between TusS and Hoia, is a much casier entrance than that between HillesS and TusS, but it cannot be recommended to strangers until the position of Aarsboen, has been deter mined. Having passed about a mile westward and northward of Skul baren, an isolated black rock lying about W. by \\ S. 4 miles from the south extreme of Hoia, the channel is open and clear to the eastward, and course may be altered to pass either west or east of Angstouren to TusS, or between Hoia and S\u00e6sS to VengsS fiord. On the east side of Angstouren there is anchorage near the shore in 8 fathoms; but as the ground is uneven and the tides are very strong, it should only be resorted to in case * There are three limekilns on Maalsn\u00e6s."], [396, "378 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [ghap. XV. of emergency. There is a good small harbour on the east side of Hoia ; the rocks in the entrance, which dry at low water, may be passed on either side. VENGSO DEEP and FIORD.\u2014 This passage to Kvalsund and TromsS is of great importance to vessels making the land about Utv\u00e6r, especially if southerly winds should hinder them from entering Malang fiord or Kval-sund ; it is also one of the easiest entrances on this part of the coast. In tolerably clear weather there will be no difficulty in distinguishing the landmarks already mentioned, and care must be taken not to approach too near the shoals off Utv\u00e6r, which will be cleared by keeping Angs touren in sight to the westward of Hoia. The summit of VengsS bearing East will lead southward of Bringskjer-Dragene, which dry at low water and break when covered; and when past these rocks a vessel may edge to the northward a little, in order to give the shoals off RSsholm a good berth. The Ganholms, or Black and White Ganholms, two round islets about 3 miles westward of LjSsS, will then be easily recognised; the southernmost is almost black, and the other is whitish, and immediately to the northward is a cluster of small rocks. It is advisable to steer for the Ganholms on an easterly bearing, but they must not be brought either northward or southward of LjSsS on any account. When within IA miles of the Ganholms, a vessel should steer so as to pass about 4 cables southward of them, proceeding in mid-channel through VengsS fiord. The shoals eastward of the Ganholms will be avoided by keeping rather over towards the point north of Tromtind, which may be passed within a distance of one mile, or by keeping the steep point on the west side of the entrance to Kai fiord bearing E. by S. From VengsS fiord vessels may pass eastward of VengsS and Musv\u00e6r, and westward of VaagsS and Gaasv\u00e6r, to Kval-sund ; the channel is free from dangers, and it is only necessary to give the land on both sides a good berth ; there is also a passage east of VaagsS. Tides. \u2014 Eastward of VengsS the tidal streams are very strong, the flood setting in from VengsS fiord, and the ebb running out. Anchorage. \u2014 The north-east extreme of Hoia bearing S.E. leads between the rocks off that island and BjSrnS to the anchorages within Ersfiord Deep. On the south side of RSsholm there is just room for one small vessel moored head and stern. In LjosSsund, between LjSsS and VengsS there is a snug harbour for small craft close to the house on LjSsS ; there is also anchorage in the middle of the sound, but the depth is 15 fathoms; the tides are very strong, and northerly winds send in a heavy swell."], [397, "VENGSO DEEF \u2014 KVAL SUND. 379 CHAP. XV.] Tromvig, on the east side of Tromtind, has a depth of 4 to 8 fathoms, and is a good harbour in any weather; the best position is off the northern most house on the west side of the bay. Vessels may bring up to wait wind or tide off Vengsvig on the south east side of VengsS, in 4 fathoms over sand. In Puskevig and the whole of the sound between VengsS and VaagsS there is a good level sandy bottom ; but a shoal runs about one cable off VengsS towards the northern part of the sound, and, as already observed, the tides are very strong. KVAL SUND, which separates South KvalS and RingvadsS, is the channel generally used by vessels bound to TromsS from the northward. The entrances from seaward, Simabak Leden and Stor Leden, are separated by a number of shoals, most of which break during westerly winds on account of their irregular formation and steep slope to the westward, while even in calm weather the ground swell causes the sea to break on several of the shoalest parts ; they are therefore at all times more or less dangerous, although the least water on them is 5 fathoms. Vindstraafald, the outer shoal between the two entrances, carries 5 fathoms, and breaks with very little sea. Faldene, on which there are 7 fathoms, is the northernmost shoal on the south side of Store Leden, and is also one of the first to break. A vessel will be near the shoals off the entrance to Kval-sund, when the principal cluster of Utv\u00e6r is in line with Astrida, and the north extreme of GrStS is hidden by South FuglS. Pilots. \u2014 Iu June, July, August, or September, pilots might be obtained from LyngS, which, though not inhabited, is frequented by fishermen during the summer ; at other times Musv\u00e6r, north of VengsS, is the only place whence assistance can be expected. Tides. \u2014 The tidal streams are very strong in all parts of Kval-sund, especially towards the south end of the sound, and in the narrow passages east and west of Haakj\u00e6rring holm, where springs attain a velocity of 6 or 7 knots. The streams turn at high and low water, the flood setting in from seaward, and the ebb running out. ' DIRECTIONS. \u2014 If intending to enter Kval-sund, Utv\u00e6r should be kept a little eastward of Astrida, and South FuglS should be shut in south of the north extreme of GrStS, until Skarstensfjeld and Sejhuln\u00e6s, on the north and south sides of the entrance to Kval-sund, are clearly distinguished ; the small round island LyngS, the flat-topped island RisS, and a small stream named Snig-elv, which runs down Skarstensfjeld, and looks like a fine white stripe on the side of the mountain, are also important landmarks. Snig-elv in line with Treingerne, the western rocks off LisS, will lead northward of Vindstraafald ; and the highest part of LyngS in line with Valn\u00e6s, the point immediately south of Gaasv\u00e6r, will lead clear through the Simabak channel, and westward of the 3-fathom shoal Stortorskbo. When within IA miles of"], [398, "380 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. LyngS, course may be altered to pass 2 or 3 cables northward of the rocks off that island, and the channel is then clear up to Kval-sund. If unable to proceed through Kval-sund on account of the tide, a vessel may bring up either at Outer or Inner Korvig on the south-west side of RingvadsS, or on the opposite side of the sound at Vaagen or Tronjord. Shoal ground extends about 2 cables northward from the rock off the en trance to Outer Korvig, and the same distance westward from the point south of Inner Korvig ; a rock lies near the shore about 4 cables northward of the house at Tronjord, and the northernmost rock on the south side of the anchorage lies between one and 2 cables from the shore eastward of the house. Small Russian fishing craft sometimes anchor on the east side of LyngS, but the harbour is small and shallow. There is also anchorage on the avhole of the east side of RisS, but there are only 2 fathoms at several cables from the shore, aud farther out, where the depth is greater, vessels would be exposed to north-westerly winds and swell. In Engvig, on the west side of Rebben\u00e6sS, there are only 8 to 12 feet. After passing Inner Korvig it is necessary to keep over towards Ring vadsS, in order to avoid a rocky shoal lying nearly in mid-channel one mile eastward of Tronjord house. Haakj\u00e6rring holm, from which a shoal ex tends half a mile to the northward, may be passed on either side, but it is advisable to take the western passage, keeping as nearly as possible in mid-channel. The shoals off TSnsn\u00e6s, are the only dangers between Haakj\u00e6rring holm and TromsS. Besides the places already mentioned, vessels might bring up in almost any part of Kvalsund, near the shore, to wait for a favourable tide. The marks for entering Stor Leden, which is broader than the Simabak entrance, are Little LyngS, a small holm close south of LyngS, in line with the point between Outer and Inner Korvig, or that point kept just north of Sejhuln\u00e6s. After passing Vindstraafald and Faldene, there is nothing more to fear in fine weather ; but if there is much sea on, it is advisable to edge to the southward when the breakers on Faldene bear about W. by S. until Snig-elv approaches the rocks off LyngS, in order to give Nord Ledbo and MjSlvigbo a good berth. Furboen, about 2 miles westward of LyngS, breaks constantly. When within 2 A miles of LyngS, course may be altered to pass northward of that island as directed above. Entrances North and South of Sando.*\u2014 These channels are difficult, and should not be attempted without a pilot. Small vessels taking the southern entrance might find anchorage among the islets south * Also termed Mjolvig by the pilots and fishermen, after the house on the east side of the island."], [399, "381 CHAP. XV.] DIRECTIONS. of SandS, on the east side of RisS, or at the south end of Rebben\u00e6sS ; there is also an anchorage at MjSlvig. NORTH Of SOUTH FUGLO.\u2014 The entrance north of South FuglS is on the whole easy, but if the tide is falling a vessel will have a strong stream against her in GrStS-sund ; the tides run strongest over a rocky ledge carrying 4 to 6 fathoms, which extends right across the sound from the north point of AndamS, or Andammen. From GrStS-sund and Bers\u00e6t-sund, vessels may proceed either through SkagS-sund and Kval-sund to TromsS ; eastward through HelgS fiord ; or northward through Raasa. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 By bearings of the sharp sugar-loaf peak of South FuglS, the small island M\u00e6gta, and the two peaks of HatS, there will be little difficulty in distinguishing the small rock Kolbenskjer, which lies 1^ miles northward of South FuglS, and bas the shape and appearance of a black cask. T\u00e6nbo, on which there are 13 fathoms, lies W.N.W. H miles from Kolbenskjer, and the south extreme of HatSbo, a rocky ledge carrying 2 to 5 fathoms, lies N.N.E. E. IA miles from the same rock. Kolbenskjer, kept between the north and south points of HatS, will lead between the shoals off South FuglS and T\u00e6nbo ; and the same rock in line with M\u00e6gta, leads between T\u00e6nbo and HatSbo. The north side of Kolbenskjer should be given a fair berth, and vessels entering from the southward should edge to the northward when within a mile of it. When within 2 miles of HatS, course may be altered to pass between that island and Mulen to GrStS-sund. The rocks eastward of the low holms south of HatS, and Sandholmbo (between the north points of Rebben\u00e6sS and AndamS), are dry at low water, and break when covered. If unable to stem the tide in GrStS-sund a vessel might bring up for a time off the rocks west of GrStS ; the anchorage off GrStS house has only a depth of 3 fathoms over sand. When proceeding through GrStS-sund it is necessary to keep about two-thirds over towards the south side of the sound, as large masses of fallen rock extend several cables from GrStS. When past the south-east point of that island, course may be altered for Bers\u00e6t-sund. Varge-sund, between Rebben\u00e6sS and HersS, is so narrow, and the tidal streams run through with such violence, that though sufficiently deep it cannot be considered a navigable channel. Bers\u00e6t-SUnd. \u2014 In passing through Bers\u00e6t-sund, an easy channel between HersS and North KvalS, it is only necessary to keep well out from the land on either side, and vessels should not haul into SkagS-sund until Hornet on HelgS is open south of North KvalS, or until the north points of RingvadsS and the high steep island DaavS are in line, in order"], [400, "382 VEST VAAGO TO NORTH KVALO. [chap. XV. to clear the shoals extending nearly three-quarters of a mile south-east ward from HersS. SkagO-SUnd. \u2014 In SkagS-sund, a winding passage southward of HersS and Rebben\u00e6sS,. the tidal streams run very strong, especially be tween Varvig and GjSvig ; the flood sets north-eastward and the ebb south westward. The shoals off Storfjeld, GjSvig, and Skarstensfjeld will be avoided by keeping nearest to RingvadsS in the north-eastern part of the sound, and nearest to Rebben\u00e6sS when southward of Varvig. If unable to stem the tide, vessels may bring up in almost any part of SkagS-sund near the shore. On the south-east side of HersS there is a good harbour for small vessels, with a depth of 3 fathoms, increasing to the westward and southward. The best anchorages in SkagS-sund are Varvig, Botten, Finkirken, Jutevig, and GjSvig, but at all these places the depth decreases to about 3 fathoms near the shore, and farther out vessels are in the strength of the tide. Small craft may also bring up in the sound east of Teistholm, where there are 3 fathoms. In Maasvig there are only 8 to 12 feet. North of Grdto. \u2014 There is a narrow chaunel leading northward of HatS and GrStS from South FuglS, but it cannot be taken without a pilot, and is only known to those living in the immediate neighbourhood. There is also a straight but narrow passase between the rocks and shoals that extend 5 or 6 miles northward from GrStS and North KvalS. The marks for this channel are Toftefiordn\u00e6s on Rebben\u00e6sS in line with the north-east extreme of GrStS, but it ought not to be attempted by strangers The flood stream sets in to the southward between the rocks off GrStS and North KvalS, and the ebb runs out to the northward. Eastward of Maasn\u00e6s, the west point of North KvalS, there is a good harbour for vessels of 8 feet draught. INNER LEAD. \u2014 Vessels bound to the northward from TromsS may either put to sea through Kval-sund, or proceed through GrSt-sund or Lange-sund, to FuglS Sveet, FuglS-sund, or the inner channels south ward of ArnS. Between TromsS and South KvalS is a channel named Sande-sund, which, though sufficiently deep in mid-chaunel, is never used. Near the east side of GrindS the depth is only 4 fathoms, but increases towards the west side of TromsS ; farther northward, in the narrowest part of the sound, there are shoals on both sides, with a depth of 8 fathoms between them. Gr6t-SUnd. \u2014 In GrSt-sund, a broad clear channel southward of RingvadsS and RenS, the wind is less variable than is usual in the inner channels on this part of the coast, and the tides are but little felt, as the"], [401, "CHAP. XV.] 383 INNER LEAD. principal streams of flood and ebb are directed through Kval-sund and TromsS-sund. TSnsn\u00e6sbo is a rocky shoal extending nearly three-quarters of a mile N.W. and S.E. ; a low white rock on the south-eastern part, which lies 4 cables from the point on the south side of TSnsvig, is marked by a stone beacon, and never covers ; the north-west end, which lies nearly one mile from Kragn\u00e6s on South KvalS, shows rooky at low water, and is marked by an iron pillar. Two rocks, carrying 6 and 8 feet, lie half a mile south westward of TSnsn\u00e6sbo. These dangers may be passed on either side, but the eastern channel is narrow, and has only 4 fathoms in the middle, shoaling gradually towards the sides.* A shoal, visible under water, runs off GrStn\u00e6s, the south-east point of RenS.f Small vessels will find good anchorage, in 4 fathoms over sand, south westward of Ringvadsholm, a small low islet westward of the entrance to Lange-sund. There is also good anchorage north and south of the islets between NipS and Finkrogen, in 9 to 4 fathoms ; a sunken rock, south east of NipS, is marked by an iron pole, and the rock westward of NipS is 4 feet above high water. * Master's Remark book, H.M.S.

GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 This part ofthe coast (North KvalS to North Cape) includes the entrances to Hammerfest and the Kaa fiord copper works in Alten fiord, as well as the principal northern entrances to TromsS, and is therefore of considerable importance. It has already been mentioned, that eastward of North Kvalo there is no regular \" skjergaard,\" and from this point to the Russian frontier in Varanger fiord the mainland is either exposed to the open sea or protected at intervals by large islands with bold foreshores ; it is also deeply indented by large fiords, which generally run straight in from the sea, with but few branches or windings. Between the islands and the mainland there are several considerable sounds, so that the Inner Lead still continues, though with long and frequent breaks, as far as Porsanger fiord, eastward of the North Cape. It is con sidered advisable, however, to describe the inner passages on this part of the coast in their natural order, together with the entrances from seaward and the principal fiords, instead of, as heretofore, regarding the Inner Lead as a continuous channel. At North KvalS the coast bends more to the eastward, and trends generally in an E.N.E. directiou to the North Cape. NORTH KVALO to SORO.\u2014 About half-way between North KvalS and the North Cape is the large island SSrS, in point of size the third island on the coast of Norway, The outer islands between North KvalS and SSrS are VandS, North FuglS, ArnS, and Loppen ; within these are the three great inlets Ulfs fiord, Lyngen fiord, and Kv\u00e6nangen fiord ; and between Loppen and SSrS is the opening named Alten, which forms the western entrance to Hammerfest and Alten fiord. The large peninsula formed by Kv\u00e6nangen fiord, Stiern-sund, and Lang fiord (a branch of Alten fiord), separates the Amts of TromsS and Finmarken, and is connected with the mainland by Alteidet, an isthmus 6 miles broad, over which there is a road for vehicles ; this peninsula is a mass of wild mountains, attaining * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Norway, sheet, xii, Helgo to Soro, No 2,314, and Norway, sheet xiii, Soro to the North Cape, No. 2,315."], [403, "NORTH KVALO TO SORO. 385 CHAP. XVI.] a height of 3,500 feet, and exposing flat snow-covered surfaces, from which glaciers pour down on almost every side nearly to the level of the sea ; it is named the JSkels* fjeld, and is indented by fiords in all directions.! TIDES. \u2014 At a distance of 5 to 10 miles from the outer islands the tidal streams follow the direction of the coast, the flood setting to the north ward and eastward, and the ebb to the southward and westward. Nearer the land the flood sets more directly towards it, and the ebb runs off to seaward, the direction of the streams varying with the trend of the coast. In the outer channels the tides are still more affected by local conditions, and the influence of the wind is very perceptible. Thus, when the wind remains fixed in one quarter the tidal current frequently follows it in FuglS-sveet, FuglS-sund, Lyngen fiord, and SorS-sund, for several days. In Lange-sund, between RingvadsS and RenS, where the tide is much stronger than in GrSt-sund, the streams turn one hour after high and low water, the flood setting northward, and the ebb southward. In KarlsS-sund the flood runs eastward, and the ebb westward. In Kaag-sund, Log-sund, and Maur-sund, the streams turn 3 hours after high and low water, the flood setting to the eastward and northward, and the ebb in the contrary direction. In the outer parts of the various inlets the tide runs in from seaward \u2022with the flood, and out with the ebb. The ordinary rise and fall is 5 or 6 feet. LANDMARKS.\u2014 There is generally little difficulty in distinguishing the landmarks on this part of the coast, as there are several conspicuous mountains on the outer islands, which stand out in bold relief against the broad openings of the fiord. Vandn\u00e6ringen, the name usually applied to the high land on the north end of the large island VandS, is formed by the flat-topped precipitous mountains Bratn\u00e6ring and Jeisn\u00e6ring, the summits of which slope gradually towards the north. The mountains on the southern part of VandS attain an elevation of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. When approaching VandS from the north-westward, South FuglS, and some of the landmarks already described, will also be visible ; North FuglS will project beyond Vandn\u00e6r ingen, to which, from this point of view, it has some resemblance. * Jokel is the Icelandic name for \" glacier.\" \u25a0f These are probably the northernmost glaciers of the old continent except, perhaps, the small ones on the neighbouring island of Seiland. Only one or two summits near Alten fiord attain the snow hue, and the hills being lower in the interior of Finmarken than on the coast, at the same time that the snow line is higher, perpetual snow may be said to be entirely unknown there, as well as at the North Cape, in Finland, and in Russia in Europe. \u2014 Professor J. D. Forbes. Cairns are not unfrequently found on the Jokels fjeld ; they are said to have been built for the reception of Lapp idols. K 740. E B"], [404, "386 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. When FuglS-sveet is open, North FuglS will appear quite detached and is then a very conspicuous landmark, it rises to a height of about 2,500 feet, with a very steep fall to the south and west ; about three-quarters of a mile from FuglS-skagen, the north-western extreme of the island, lies a small islet named Kalv. On opening Kv\u00e6nangen fiord the jagged summits of Kv\u00e6nangstinderne will be visible eastward of the high island ArnS, which is very steep to the north and west. Loppen will appear low and dark, with an even slope to the northward, it is the lowest land on the coast, and has a flat summit. The mountains on StjernS will be visible over or eastward of Sildmyling, on the north end of Silden, which will make like sugar-loaves ; and in clear weather the north-western promontory of SSrS, which is named Fuglen or Soppen, will be visible at a distance of 30 miles. If farther to the eastward, Andotten, which is very steep towards the the sea, will be seen on the north side of Bredvig Bunden, a large bay on the west side of SSrS. Lille Haaen, the south-west point of SSrS, is also a good mark, it is separated from the higher hill Store Haaen or Navern, north of Hasvig, by a low neck of land. The north coast of SSrS cannot be seen distinctly from the westward. Other useful objects will be seen on nearing the land; but as they serve as leading marks for the various entrances from seaward, they will be described hereafter. DANGERS off VANDO and NORTH PUGLO.\u2014 At a distance of 7 to 9 miles from VandS and North FuglS, a dangerous line of rocks and shoals, between which there are several difficult passages, extends about 17 miles in an east and west direction and at 6 and 12 miles north eastward of these are the Inner and Outer Gj\u00e6sboen shoals. The western shoals north of VandS are Tampeisa with 6 fathoms, GrStSgrund with 3 fathoms, Ost Fuglbo with 10 fathoms, Svebo with 5 fathoms, NordstS with 3 fathoms, and eastward of these, Kusgrund with 8, and Bredgrund with 5 fathoms water. NordstS, the northernmost of these shoals, lies about N.W. | N. 8A miles from Grimsholm, an islet eastward of Vandn\u00e6ringen, with the north-western extreme of VandS bearing S. \u00a3 W. Vestre or West Gaassene.\u2014 According to some of the fishermen, West Gaassene are two steep shoals lying about 2 miles north and south of each other, one being named Medgaastaren, and the other Gaas\u00e6gtaren. Others state that all these names belong to a single small shoal carrying 6 to 10 fathoms, which breaks, but only with a heavy sea. All agree, however, that a bank, which sometimes breaks in several places, extends about 2 miles north and south, and that the marks for the northern extreme are HelgS Hornet in line with Thorsnakken, and Luten (one of the"], [405, "CHAP. XVI.] 387 DANGERS. R\u00e6kvik peaks on Arno), in line with Brusen, the south point of North FuglS. Ostre or East Gaassene, between 2 and 3 miles eastward of West Gaassene, extend IA miles in a north-west and south-east direction, they dry at low water, and the sea breaks all round them in many places. The marks for the western rock are RSdgamsn\u00e6s in line with the west side of Vandn\u00e6ringen, and Bredskartind, southward of Luten, in fine with Brusen. Nordbo, on which there is only one fathom, extends about one mile N.W. and S.E., and breaks in three places ; the centre of the shoal lies about 7 miles N. E. from North FuglS, with Kv\u00e6nangstinderne in line with the north-east side of V\u00e6ggen, the high land on the north end of ArnS ; the cross marks for the north-west or south-east extremes of Nordbo are Spennen in line with Kalv or FuglS-skagen. Kj\u00e6rring-grund, a fishing ground southward of Nordbo, carries 18 to 22 fathoms and does not break. Kalvbo, a steep conical rock carrying 5 fathoms, lies barely half a mile northward of FuglS-Kalv ; it breaks with a moderate sea. INDRE GJ\u00c6SBOEN or INDERBOFALDETisconsidered the most dangerous shoal off this part of the coast on account of its position and extent. The shallowest part found, on which there are 5 to 6 fathoms lies about N.N.E. f E. 13 miles from the north end of FuglS, in latitude 70\u00b0 30' N., longitude 20\u00b0 27' E. ; the marks for this spot are Vandtinden on VandS in line with FuglS-skagen, and Eliasen on StjernS in line with Sildmyling. The ground is very irregular, rising in sharp rocky points to within 5 or 6 fathoms of the surface, while 20 fathoms are found close-to. The 5 and 6 fathom patches break in quite moderate weather ; and in bad weather it is probable that the sea' breaks where there are 15 and 16 fathoms. YDRE GJ\u00c6SBOEN, about 5 miles N.N.E. of Inderbo Faldet, is the northernmost part of the Gj\u00e6sbo fishing ground ; it has a uniform depth of from 20 to 30 fathoms, and consists of coarse sand with small stones and corals. There is no reason to suppose that Ydre Gj\u00e6sboen ever breaks. The fishermen state that Inner and Outer Gj\u00e6sboen are separated by a channel 80 fathoms deep, and as the formation of Inderbo Faldet is ex tremely irregular, it is possible that such a depth may exist to the north ward ; it seems probable, nevertheless, that both these banks are elevations of a continuous ridge, especially as the ground declines with a gradual slope to the southward aud northward. The limits of Gj\u00e6sbo are very1 indefinite, the name being indiscriminately applied to all the fishing grounds in the direction of a line joining Vandtinden and FuglS-skagen. Marks. \u2014 Rosmaalen on North KvalS, kept southward of S.W. by W. will lead westward of Inne and Outer Gj\u00e6sboen ; Fuglen on SSrS bearing BE 2"], [406, "NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. 388 [chap. xvi. E. S. will lead northward, and Eliasen on StjernS bearing S.E. by E., or well open northward of Sildmyling, will lead northward. Shoals off S6r6. \u2014 There are several shoals carrying from 4 to 10 fathoms westward of SSrv\u00e6r and Fuglen ; but they are all within 2 miles of the shore. Kveitegrund and Grundbak, further to the westward, are fishing grounds with more than 30 fathoms water. Renlibo, about 3 miles N.N.E. of Fuglen, has only 16 fathoms water, and may be supposed to break in bad weather. Sildbo, which lies about a mile northward of Renlibo, is also considered dangerous by the fishermen ; but as the least water found was 23 fathoms, it probably never breaks ; the same remark applies to BrSndseraas. HAVBRO. \u2014 In 1841-2 Lieutenants Motzfeldt and Johansen, of the Norwegian navy, were employed to determine the extent and position of the shoals and supposed fishing grounds between South FuglS and SSrS. The result was a probability, bordering on certainty, that off this part of the coast there is no continuous bank, such as was supposed to exist. The shoals off VandS and North FuglS may be more correctly considered as spurs of the ridges to which those islands belong. The only trace of such a bank as the so-termed Havbro is that the surveying vessel, when sounding along the coast at a distance of 50 to 60 miles from the outer islands, found less water than when nearer the land, but generally not less than 130 to 140 fathoms ; the least depth found was 118 fathoms, in latitude 71\u00b0 26' N., longitude 19\u00b0 49' E.* It is possible that shallower spots exist, but judging by the soundings hitherto taken, it seems very improbable that there is any bank of practical use to seamen. Where soundings have been taken between the coast and the lesser depths, the bottom has generally been reached with about 200 fathoms of line. The edge of th.e barrier, beyond which lie the greater depths of the cold area, is probably not far to the north and west of South FuglS ; but between the whole of the north coast of Norway and the Spitzbergen bank, the depth has not been found to exceed 200 or 300 fathoms. MAKING the LAND.\u2014 In clear weather, South FuglS, North KvalS, VandS, and North FuglS will be seen long before the outer dangers are approached, and there will be no difficulty in making the channel between Gj\u00e6sboen and SSrS, which is on the whole the safest for strangers . it is therefore recommended, that vessels bound to TromsS from the north ward, or to any part of Finmarken from the southward, should endeavour to make the land to the eastward of North KvalS, in preference to attempt ing the devious channels between Malang fiord and North FuglS. With a fair wind and fine clear weather vessels might pass on either side of Nordbo, but the narrow passages between East Gaassene and the western * Den Norske Lods, vol. 8, 1870."], [407, "CHAP. XVI.] 389 HAVBRO BANK \u2014 DIRECTIONS. rocks off VandS, should not be attempted at any time without a pilot, as the wind is very unsteady near the land, the currents are strong, and if caught in a fog, a vessel would be in great danger. Pilots may be obtained from Loppen island, and also from Hasvig and Risvaag, on the south-western extreme of SSrS. ENTRANCE between NORTH KVALO and VANDO. \u2014 The rocky ground off GrStS and North KvalS extends nearly 4 miles northward from Fladv\u00e6r, a group of low islets off Rosmaalen, and about the same distance N. by E. from LyngS, a low island on the west side of the channel between North KvalS and Vandn\u00e6ringen. If intending to stand in for this channel from the north-westward it must be borne in mind that when Brusen is in line with the north extreme of VandS, a vessel would be steering direct for the northernmost shoals off Fladv\u00e6r ; the whole of North FuglS must therefore be kept open northward of VandS or until LyngS is in line with Finsula, the eastern extreme of North KvalS, until the eastern extreme of HelgS is just open westward of Vandn\u00e6ringen ; the latter marks, or Hornet on HelgS bearing S. W., will lead in between the dangers off Fladv\u00e6r and VandS. The whole of Fladv\u00e6r kept southward of South FuglS, or the latter island kept southward of S.W. by W., will lead northward of the dangers eastward of VandS, and when the east point of HelgS is westward of Vandn\u00e6ringen a vessel may haul to the southward as directed above. Fl\u00e6sa rocks, which lie about 2 miles westward of Vandn\u00e6ringen, may be passed on either side, but when taking the eastern passage it is necessary to keep well over towards VandS, especially if there is much sea on. When past Fl\u00e6sa, vessels may either proceed westward of HelgS, through Raasa to SkagS-sund, or HelgS fiord ; or eastward of HelgS, through Hammer fiord, to Lange-sund, or KarlsS-sund. Thorsvaag, on the north-west side of Vandn\u00e6ringen, is an indifferent harbour for small vessels ; east of the high islet Koja there are 2A to 3 fathoms, and farther out in the sound 4 fathoms ; southerly winds send in rather a heavy sea. Hammer fiord. \u2014 Vessels may bring up on the east side of Hammer fiord, with the northern extreme of HelgS bearing W. by N. A N., in 8 to 12 fathoms over sand ; but the roadstead is exposed to north-westerly winds. There are no dangers in Hammer fiord. Raasa.\u2014 With a southerly wind it is better to beat through Raasa than Hammer fiord whether bound to the eastward or westward ; the land on either side may be approached to within 2 cables, and anchorage may be found, if necessary, eastward of the rocks off HelgS house, on the south west side of HelgS ; the depth is 4 to 6 fathoms over fine sand, but near"], [408, "390 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. the eastern rock there are only 2\\ fathoms, shoaling towards the shore. If the wind is strong from the south-east, vessels might bring up between the westernmost of these rocks, and the west point of HelgS. There is also a good but very small harbour between North KvalS and the holms west of RSdgammen ; it has a depth of 3 fathoms over good holding ground, and may be entered either from the eastward or westward. HelgO, Daav, and Grund fiords. \u2014 When passing through HelgS fiord vessels should give the whole of the north coast of RingvadsS a good berth, as large blocks of stone extend several cables off shore. Kj\u00e6rringskjer, which lies S.W. l\u00a3 miles from the south-east point of HelgS, is visible above water. A reef runs about 2\\ miles in a N.W. by N. direction off Fusken\u00e6s, the north point of RenS ; the north-western extreme carries 16 feet at low water springs, and never breaks ; about one mile N.W. from Fusken\u00e6s, the depth is 4 to 4^ fathoms, but nearer the point there are numerous large boulders. Besides the harbours off HelgS house, there is anchorage on the south side of DaavS in 8 fathoms. The harbour at Langstrand, on the east side of Daav fiord, is very small, but deep enough for large vessels ; the rocks east and south-west of the islet that forms the harbour, are dry at low water. Grund fiord has,anchorage in 4 fathoms ; on the east side of the entrance is an extensive shoal carrying from 2 to 2\u00a3 fathoms. There is a mine here which is worked by Englishmen.* Lange-SUnd, \u2014 Between the shoals off Grund fiord and Fusken\u00e6s is the entrance to Lange-sund, a narrow channel between RingvadsS and RenS, which connects HelgS fiord and GrSt-sund, the eastern entrance to TromsS ; it is free from dangers, and good anchorage will be found north and south of the projecting point, Skatoren, in 4 to 8 fathoms over sand ; there is also good holding ground near both shores of the sound, but as the tides are strong, and the wind invariably fails, the channel eastward of RenS is always preferable for sailing vessels. Karls6-SUnd and Vand6-SUnd. \u2014 KarlsS-sund, between RenS and KarlsS, is free from dangers, with the exception of the reef off Fusken\u00e6s. The anchorages opposite KarlsS church and at Gammel Gaarden, (the old house), are protected from northerly and southerly winds ; but it is advisable to anchor well off shore, as if the wind shifts to north-west or south-east it is generally necessary to weigh. VandS-sund, between KarlsS and VandS is a broad, clear channel, but has no anchorage. * I believe that iron pyrites are exported from Grund fiord, but have not been able to ascertain for certain. \u2014 Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N."], [409, "chap, xvi.] HELGO FIORD \u2014 FUGLO SUND. 391 FUGLO-SVEET and PUGLO-STJND, the entrances west and east of North FuglS, are generally used by vessels bound to TromsS from the northward. The wind nearly always fails in FuglS-sund, even when a stiff breeze is blowing outside and inside, therefore it is not recommended for sailing vessels. Having entered between the rocks off North KvalS and VandS, a vessel might proceed northward of VandS to FuglSsveet, passing on either side of the Grimsholms and Rundskjer, instead of continuing through Raasa or Hammer fiord. The Grimsholms are rocky islets about 200 feet high, and when open north of Vandn\u00e6ringen will show three detached peaks ; the southern peak, kept just open north of Vandn\u00e6ringen, will lead southward of Tampeisa. As a rule, the channels between Bredgrund and Inderbo Faldet should only be taken by those acquainted with the marks for the various shoals, but in fine settled weather, careful bearings of North FuglS might be sufficient guide. Shoals extend nearly one mile from Kvitn\u00e6s, the eastern extreme of VandS ; but southward of that point the channel is clear, and vessels bound to TromsS may proceed either north or south of KarlsS to Lange sund, or eastward of RenS to GrSt-sund, according to circumstances. Between Gj\u00e6sboen and S6r6. \u2014 If intending to stand in between Gj\u00e6sboen shoal and SSrS, which, as already observed, is the best entrance for strangers, give North KvalS and VandS a berth of at least 10 miles, and keep Rosmaalen bearing southward of S.W. by W. until Fuglen bears E. -| S., or Eliasen on StjernS bears about S.E. by E., when it will be open northward of Sildmyling. The latter marks will lead north-eastward of Outer Gj\u00e6sboen ; the east side of North FuglS bearing S.W. by S., or Vandtinden open southward of Brusen, will lead well eastward of Inderbo Faldet, and when within 10 miles of North FuglS, course may be altered for FuglS-sveet or FuglS-sund. Kalvbo will be cleared by giving FuglS skagen a berth of 1 A or 2 miles. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 BurS-havn, between VandS and BurS, has a depth of 5 fathoms ; the southern entrance is clear, but that from the northward should not be attempted by strangers. BurS will be easily distinguished ; it forms a single hill, about 500 feet high, and nearly round. ' The sound between Store and Lille SkSrS can only be entered from the southward. There is anchorage under Store SkSrS, opposite the house nearest the entrance ; but vessels would be more sheltered from the squalls off VandS, and out of Lyngen fiord, off the holm lying in a small bight on the north-east side of Lille Skoro ; there are 4 fathoms over good holding ground at both places."], [410, "392 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. North Fugl6 is so steep and inaccessible that there is only one place north of Haakj\u00e6rringn\u00e6s where boats can land, and that only when the sea is smooth. Spennen, eastward of SkorS, is also steep, but not very high ; vessels might bring up in summer, during north-westerly winds, between the rocks off the south side, where there is also a landing place. Vandvaag, on the south-east side of VandS, has a depth of 5 fathoms over sand, but is small and narrow, and exposed to heavy squalls in bad weather. Lang Fiord. \u2014 On the west side of Lang fiord, an inlet on the south side of ArnS, is a bight named Akker fiord, where vessels might anchor, either off the house or farther to the northward, in 4 to 5 fathoms over sand ; but they would be exposed to heavy squalls during all westerly winds. North and SOUth Lenangen, the inlets on the east side of the entrance to Ulfs fiord, would afford anchorage to small vessels, but they are bordered by shoal ground, and are exposed to the northward. ULFS FIORD forms the continuation of the channel leading east ward of RenS from FuglS-sveet and FuglS-sund, and, with SSr fiord, extends upwards of 20 miles in a S.S.W. direction from GrStsund ; it is free from dangers, and besides the open roadsteads at Oldervig and J\u00e6ger vand, has more sheltered anchorage at the trading station GjSvig, on the south side of the entrance to Kjosen, where there are 5 to 6 fathoms opposite the merchant's house, and 4 fathoms in the small bight to the westward. There is also a boat harbour at Skjevaag, between Ulfs fiord and GrSt sund. SSr fiord is connected with Ulfs fiord by a narrow strait and rapid known as StrSmmen, which is hardly navigable for boats. Kjosen is a narrow inlet extending 7 miles in an easterly direction from GjSvig to Lyngseide, between mountains averaging about 5,000 feet in height ; the wind sweeps down from these mounlains with such violence that the houses and farms in the neighbourhood often sustain considerable damage. Kjosen and the inner part of SSr fiord are generally frozen during some part of every winter. Lyngstnen. \u2014 Ulfs and Lyngen fiords are separated by a remarkably wild mountainous peninsula, which rises in several places to upwards of 4,000 feet, and terminates in the headland named Lyngstuen or Lyngens Klubb. Lyngseide, the isthmus connecting this peninsula with the mainland, is 2 miles broad between Lyngen and Kjosen, and not more that 200 feet high ; it is crossed by a good road for vehicles. A shoal runs about 2 cables off the north side of Lyngstuen."], [411, "NORTH FUGLO \u2014 KAAG SUND. 393 CHAP. XVI.] LYNGEN FIORD, with its continuation Stor fiord, penetrates about 40 miles inland in a southerly and south-westerly direction from Lyngstuen ; it is nevertheless unfrozen the whole year through. This fiord is politically interesting, as the inner part is only about 25 miles from the western boundary of the Russian Empire. It is also noted for its magnificent scenery. In November and January a fair is held at Skibotten, on the east side of the Stor fiord ; there is a bridle road through the Ski botten valley, as well as a winter track communicating with Sweden ; the latter is principally used by Lapps, who bring the produce of their reindeer to the winter fairs, and by Quains, who trade chiefly in butter.* Lyngsbo, about 2 miles westward of VorterS, is nearly always awash, and carries an iron pillar ; the marks for it are the north points of Lyngs tuen and KarlsS in line ; Brusen in line with Sotn\u00e6s on ArnS ; and the north point of VorterS in line with the north side of Kaagen. Both Lyngsbo and Braadtet, off the west side of U1S, are very dangerous in thick weather, but if the land can be seen they are easily avoided by keeping rather to wards the western shore ofthe fiord. A shoal extends 1| miles northward from Spoken\u00e6s, and there are several rocks off the AarS holms, as well as in Lyngseide-bugt, and along the low land between that and Pollen. Anchorage may be found at Dybvig, AarS holm, Lyngseide-bugt, Pollen, and Skibotten, but the latter place is exposed to the northward. Kaa fiord extends 9 miles in an easterly direction from Nordn\u00e6s ; the inner part is shoal. Winds. \u2014 Both Ulfs fiord and Lyngen fiord must be navigated with great caution, on account of the violence and irregularity of the winds. Lyngen fiord is considered especially dangerous, as the wind is deflected by the mountains, and blows in contrary directions in different parts of the fiord. It frequently happens that when a gale is blowing in one of these fiords it is dead calm in the other, a fact to be borne in mind when rounding Lyngstuen. All winds from East through south to W.S.W. blow out of Lyugen fiord, where there is often a stiff breeze while it is calm in FuglS sund. Northerly winds prevail in summer, and southerly winds in winter ; the latter are the most dangerous. , INNER CHANNELS. \u2014 On leaving GrSt-sund or Lange-sund, vessels bound to the northward and eastward from TromsS may either pro ceed northward or southward of ArnS to Kv\u00e6nangen fiord. Kaag-sund is the shortest passage from KarlsS or Lyngstuen, and Maur-sund from Lyngen fiord. Kaag-SUnd, between ArnS and Kaagen, is free from dangers, with the exception of a rock carrying 6 feet, which lies nearly half a mile south- * The Mortendals, Skibotten, and Kaa fiord rivers, which flow into Lyngen fiord, though rich in trout, are of little importance as salmon streams."], [412, "394 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. ward of the house on Haugn\u00e6s, the point on the east side of the entrance to Lang fiord. Skagegrund, which also carries 6 feet, lies within 3 cables of the north point of VorterS. From Kaag-sund vessels may proceed east ward of LSgo, passing on either side of Skj\u00e6rvo-skjer and Skj\u00e6rvS-bo, or westward of LSgS through LSg-sund; the latter channel is not recom mended, as very sudden and violent squalls strike down from ArnS during westerly and south-westerly winds. Kaag-sund is connected with VorterS sund and Maur-sund by KjSlmangen, a clear channel between VorterS and Kaagen. The anchorages between GrSt-sund and Kaae-sund are KarlsS-sund ; North and South Lenangen ; and Lang fiord. Vessels tamng this passage may also bring up northward of Singlen, a house on the south-east side of ArnS, in 6 to 8 fathoms over good holding ground, or south of Havnn\u00e6s in LSg-sund, where there is also good holding ground, in 8 so 12 fathoms. Maur-SUnd. \u2014 VorterS-sund, between VorterS and U1S, and Rot-sund, between U1S and the mainland, lead into Maur-sund from the westward. The only dangers in these channels are the shoals off Spoken\u00e6s and the west side of U15, at the south entrance to Rot-sund. There are passages on both sides of the low island Store Hagsten, at the east end of Maur sund, but a shoal stretches nearly half-way across the western channel from the east side of Lille Hagsten. There is anchorage between the Folles islands in VorterS-sund, in 5 to 7 fathoms over good holding ground, and also on the east side of Havnn\u00e6s, the south point of U15. KV\u00c6NANGEN FIORD extends about 40 miles inland in a S.E. by S. direction from the open sea ; the entrance is between ArnS and Brynild, a projecting point forming the western extreme of the peninsula between the Amts of TromsS and Finmarken. It is, with few exceptions, free from dangers, but is dotted with islands, some of which are of con siderable size and height. Between Kv\u00e6nangen and Reisen fiords are the Kv\u00e6nangs-tinderne, a fine group of jagged mountains eastward of Kaagen. On the east side of Kv\u00e6nangen fiord are the Older, Ren, JSkel, Lille Alten, and Bur fiords, but Reisen fiord is the only branch of any importance.* The inner part of Kv\u00e6nangen fiord is termed Kv\u00e6nangsbotten ; it is divided into two basins, and the water in the inner one is nearly fresh. At Kj\u00e6kan in Kv\u00e6nangsbotten there are copper works belonging to the Alten Mining Company ; an annual fair is also held there. The entrance to Kv\u00e6nangsbotten is through a narrow sound, which is impassable during springs. * At the head of the Jokel fiord is the only glacier in Norway which is actually washed by the sea, and which \" calves \" like those of Greenland."], [413, "CHAP. XVI.] KV\u00c6NANGEN FIORD \u2014 REISEN FIORD. 395 Should circumstances render it advisable to stand into Kv\u00e6nangen fiord, a vessel may either proceed for TromsS through the channels described above, or seek anchorage ; but this entrance is less used that FuglS-sveet and FuglS-sund. Vessels bound to the eastward from Kv\u00e6nangen fiord may pass on either side of Svartskjer, Kalven, and Loppen. DANGERS. \u2014 After passing eastward of Gj\u00e6sboen, as directed (page 387), a vessel may either stand towards Loppen for a pilot, or steer direct for the entrance to Kv\u00e6nangen fiord; but when working in, it will be necessary to avoid Loppebo, Svartskjer, ArnSbo, and Skj\u00e6rvSbo. Loppebo, which lies W. \\ N. 2 miles from the north point of Loppen, carries 10 fathoms, but probably breaks in bad weather. Svartskjer lies IA miles from the mainland, and 2 miles N.NE., from Brynild point ; it is very low, and a reef runs off about half a mile to the south-westward ; the sea breaks heavily over it. Amobo or V\u00e6ggbo are two rocks lying 2 miles north-eastward of the north extreme of Arno ; they are always uncovered, and break continually. Skj\u00e6rvobO, 3 miles north-eastward of Skj\u00e6rvo, carries 7 fathoms, and only breaks in very bad weather ; the marks for it are, Skj\u00e6rvSskjer in line with a stream close to the house at Storstensn\u00e6s on Kaagen, and the highest part of HukS in line with Meilandstind, one of the Kv\u00e6nangstinderne. There are several rocks about half a mile from the north side of HukS, and a reef runs 6 cables off Mandskarvig, on the north-east side of Kv\u00e6nangstinderne. Svart rocks lie half-way between Spilderen and Kj\u00e6rring holm, off the entrance to Lille Alten and Bur fiords ; and a shoal runs half a mile off the point eastward of NSglen island. A sunken rock in the entrance to Kv\u00e6nangsbotten is marked by an iron pole about 15 feet high, with a keg on the top. Anchorage. \u2014 The first anchorage southward of LSg-sund and Singlen is in a bay on the east side of Skj\u00e6rvS, which is exposed to heavy squalls during south-westerly winds. There are 5 to 8 fathoms opposite the church and houses, but the inner part of the bay is foul. The shoal off the point on the south side of the entrance carries 7 fathoms, and hardly ever breaks. There is also anchorage on the south-east side of HukS, and off the houses at Meiland. The harbours on either side of Alten mio-ht also be useful to vessels bound into Kv\u00e6nangen fiord from seaward. Reisen fiord is a large irregular inlet extending about 13 miles in a south-westerly direction from HukS. The Reisen-elv, which falls into this fiord is, next to the Maals-elv, the largest river in TromsS Amt \u2022 it is"], [414, "396 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAFE. [chap. xvi. of some importance for communication, and is said to be a good salmon stream.* ALTEN. \u2014 As already observed, the great open space between Loppen and Silden on the one side, and SSrS on the other, is termed Alten. It not only forms the western entrance to Hammerfest and Alten fiord, but is also resorted to by vessels seeking shelter and intending to put to sea again. When sure of the landmarks, a vessel may stand in between Gj\u00e6sboen and SSrS as directed, and either stere for Loppen or Hasvig, in order to obtain a pilot, or proceed direct through SSrS-sund or Stjernsund. There are no dangers in Alten except the shoals off SSrv\u00e6r and Fuglen and Haagrund, which lies W.S.W. half a mile from Haanebben, the western point of Lille Haaen, and carries 8 fathoms. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Iu and near Alten are the following anchorages ; and a few miles within the entrance is the harbour at Vasdalen in Ox fiord, on the south side of Stiern-sund. Loppen road and Frak Fiord. \u2014 The roadstead southward of Loppen church has a depth of 5 to 15 fathoms, shoaling quickly towards the shore, over a clean sandy bottom ; as all westerly winds send in a heavy swell, vessels are often obliged to weigh. The anchorage off the house at Stolen, on the west side of Frak fiord, is out of the way, and the wind is generally light and unsteady within the entrance to the fiord. Neither of these anchorages are recommended. When beating in or out of Loppen road, care must be taken to avoid Fluen shoal, which carries 5 fathoms, and runs nearly 3 cables off the north point of MarS. Between MarS and the mainland there are only 2 fathoms. BergS fiord. \u2014 Between Silden and the island to the southward, which is also named MarS, is a passage leading from South Bergs fiord to the anchorage in North Bergs fiord, which, though out of the way, might be useful in case of being obliged to leave Loppen road. The channel between the south point of Silden and MarS is very narrow, and as there is no passage between MarS and the mainland, the entrance throngh North Bergs fiord, east of Silden, is preferable. There are 6 fathoms north-eastward of the round islet Klubholm, and 3 fathoms between two islets to the east ward, but the latter anchorage is very small and the northern entrance to it is only 2 fathoms deep. It is advisable to keep nearly in mid-channel when passing through North Bergs fiord, as the wind is very squally near the land.f * According to the surveying officers the Storskog, Navet, and Vaddern rivers, though of inconsiderable size, afford fair fishing ; the Vaddern falls into the bight of the same name, east of the entrance to Kv\u00e6nangsbotten. \u2022f The principal glacier in Bergs fiord is one of the most accessible on the coast, being only a quarter of an hour's walk from the sea."], [415, "397 CHAP.

HaSVig. \u2014 The harbour at Hasvig, on the east side of the isthmus between Lille and Store Haaen, is open to all winds out of SSrS-sund, and westerly gales send in a heavy sea. A rock, covered at high water, lies close to the east point of Lille Haaen, and there are two rocks near the shore south of Store Haaen, otherwise the harbour is clear ; there are 8 fathoms over sand in the outer part, and 3 to 5 fathoms farther in, south of the merchant's house. Bredvig Bunden. \u2014 In the inner part of Bredvig Bunden, the large bay on the west side of SSrS, there is anchorage east of the islet lying close to the south shore, and also in the cove at Havnen. There is no passage south of the islet, and care must be taken to avoid a sunken rock lying close to the shore west of Havnen. S6rv\u00e6r. \u2014 The harbour at SSrv\u00e6r, south of Fuglen, is very small, and cannot be entered without a pilot. FINMARKEN. The Amt of Finmarken comprehends the northern portion of TromsS Stift, and extends from Brynild, on the north side of the entrance to Kv\u00e6nangen fiord, to Jacob's river in South Varanger ; it includes the sub districts of Alten, Hammerfest, Tanen, VardS, and Varanger, and has an area of 17,795 square miles. In 1875, the population of this Amt amounted to 19,000; of these about one-half were Norwegians, one-third Lapps, and the remainder Quains and \" Blandingsfolk \" (half-castes). In 1825 the population was only 8,320.* The fisheries supply the means of living to most of the inhabitants of Finmarken, who follow their arduous avocation at all seasons of the year when the weather admits of their putting out to sea. In the western part of Finmarken the islands and coast preserve the Alpine character of TromsS Amt, but on a less extensive scale, only the highest mountains exceeding an elevation of 3,000 feet. There is scarcely any vegetation near the coast, and most of the mountains rise precipitously * Towards the close of the 15th century the part of Einmarken then belonging to Norway had 17 churches and 12 officially appointed priests ; its further development was effectually checked by the monopoly system of trade allowed by the Danish Go vernment, and the condition of the province was deplorable until free trade was declared in 1789. The frontier question between Finmarken and Sweden was arranged in 1751, and the point was settled with regard to Russia by the convention of 1826. In 1787, Finmarken was united to Senjen and Tromso as one Amt, and was again divided in 1866."], [416, "398 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE.

There are several important fishing and trading stations, however, and some larger loomeries,')' which are mentioned hereafter. East Finmarken is distinguished by table lands of inconsiderable elevation, which descend abruptly to the sea. The whole coast of Finmarken is deeply indented, the Alten, Porsanger, Laxe, Tana, and Varanger fiords being the principal inlets. There are very few roads in this Amt, and to travel in the interior during spring and autumn is almost impracticable, while in summer, during calm weather, the air literally swarms with mosquitos ; in winter, all land journeys are performed with reindeer. Most of the lakes and rivers abound in fish, and feathered game is also plentiful. ALTEN tO the NORTH CAPE.\u2014 Southward of SSrS are the three large islands StjernS, Seiland, and KvalS ; between these are the various entrances to Alten fiord, and on the west side of KvalS is the town of Hammerfest, the capital of Finmarken. The principal islands eastward of SSrS are RolfsS, HjelmsS, MaasS, and MagerSen, the northernmost island of Europe. Having already described the various approaches to Hammer fest and Alten fiord from the westward, as far as Alten, it is considered advisable to complete them before commencing with the entrances from seaward between SSrS and the North Cape, as the latter are principally used by vessels approaching from the eastward. HAMMERFEST,! the northernmost town in the world, has now 2,100 inhabitants ; in 1807 there were only 77, and in 1854 about 1,000. The port is altogether so convenient, from its easy access and vicinity to the opeu sea, that it is of great importance to seamen ; its spacious harbour affords protection from any kind of weather, while good pilotage, and almost everything a vessel is likely to require, may be obtained at a moderate rate; it is also in the direct route to the White Sea, Siberia, Novaya Zemlya, and Spitzbergen. The town forms a semicircle round the south side of a large bay, and is fronted by a row of fine warehouses ; it is almost sur rounded by barren hills, which not only conceal it from seaward, but also to a certain extent deprive it of the limited amount of sunshine that it would otherwise enjoy. Nature here seems almost torpid, fogs are frequent, the birch trees are mere bushes near the level of the sea, and very little can be grown in the gardens ; the hills are nevertheless green during the * A hut built of turf, clay, and stones. f Fuglev\u00e6r.

Hammerfest is the residence ]of the Amtmand, and has a church, two good schools, a hospital, savings bank, and several handsome private houses. The chief trade of the port consists in purchasing and exporting the pro duce of the Finmarken fisheries, and sending expeditious to the great fishing banks for cod, and to Spitsbergen for reindeer, walrus, seals, white bears, and eider down. The harbour is resorted to by English, Russian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, German, and Spanish traders, but it is especially frequented by Russian coasters, which come to fish or to buy fish, and bring hemp, flax, tow, sailcloth, linen, tar, nails and ironmongery, and sometimes a con siderable quantity of corn. Cod liver and train oil is prepared here in large quantities, and the smell thus created sometimes pervades the whole town, and is not easily forgotten. White bear, silver fox, reindeer, and other skins, as well as eider down, walrus tusks, Lapp boots, snow shoes, &c, are sold at fair prices. SUPPLIES. \u2014 Supplies of provisions and water may be obtained at Hammerfest ; ordinary repairs can Le executed ; and, if necessary, a vessel may be strengthened for ice navigation. There is also a slip for small vessels. Vice-consuls for Great Britain and most foreign nations are resident. HAMMERFEST HAVN, which is bounded on the north-west side by a long, narrow, projecting point named Fuglen\u00e6s, is sufficiently capacious to contain several large vessels. It is well sheltered by the suiTounding mountains from all winds except those from S.S.W. to W.S.W. ; and even when those winds blow hard, vessels may ride in security near Fuglen\u00e6s, which is the best anchorage in the bay, the depths varying regularly from 5 to 23 fathoms, according to the distance from the shore, over good holding ground consisting of sand and clay. The bower may be dropped in 18 to 20 fathoms, and a stream laid out to the S.S.E. The eastern part of the bay is not only more exposed, but the shores are much steeper. Near the extremity of Fuglen\u00e6s are the remains of a battery, the harbour light, and the house and establishment of Mr. Robertson, the British vice-consul.* * Close to the consul's house is a granite pillar surmounted by a bronze globe, marking the northern termination of a meridional arc, measured, under the direction of M. Struve, from Ismail on the Danube through 25\u00b0 20' of latitude, the longest arc ever measured on the earth's surface. Fuglen\u00e6s was one of a chain of stations, extending from the equator to Spitzbergen, at which pendulum observations were made by Sir Edward Sabine in 1822-3."], [418, "NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. 400 [chap. xvi. The harbour of Hammerfest, though small, often berths a considerable number of moderate sized vessels and is, perhaps one of the most secure in the world, as no wind can affect its shipping, in fact it may be said to be completely land-locked, so that when a gale of wind is blowing outside the harbour remains unruffled and presents almost the appearance of an inland basin. The anchorage is excellent, in from 5 to 13 or 17 fathoms, and there is a row of buoys, for the use of which a small tax is levied, for securing stern hawsers to ; the inner part of the bight is shallow. There is water enough for small vessels alongside several of the private jetties. Tides.* \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Hammerfest, at about lh. 10m. From various observations made, springs would appear to rise from 7 to 10 feet. LIGHT. \u2014 On the extreme of Fuglen\u00e6s stands a yellow wooden building with a red roof, from which is exhibited a fixed white light from the 25th of August to the 19th of April. The light is elevated 25 feet, and should be visible 8 miles when bearing from S. by E. \\ E. through east and north to W. by S. \\ S. ; it cannot be seen from Soro-sund, until it is open north of Seiland, bearing about E. by N. \\ N. Molvigbo, a large sunken rock which is nearly dry at low water, lies about one cable off shore on the south side of the entrance to Hammerfest, with the south point of MelkS in line with Borvik-Klubb on SSrS ; it is marked by an iron pole with cage, and will be cleared by keeping the white house at Molden, at the head of Hammerfest bay, open northward of Hammerfestn\u00e6s, the point north of the church. It is not advisable to approach the shore nearer than one cable anywhere between Rypklubb and Hammerfestn\u00e6s, as it is rocky and foul in several places. ENTRANCES. \u2014 SSrS-sund is the shortest, and on the whole, the best entrance to Hammerfest from the westward, especially in bad weather, wheu it is undesirable to be off the north coast of SSrS ; but in summer, with an easterly wind, a long tedious beat might be saved by stretching well off the land, and standing in to the eastward of SSrS. The best entrance from the eastward is through RolfsS-sund. SORO-SUND. \u2014 The western part of SSrS-sund is from 6 to 8 miles broad, but between SSrS and the north-western part of Seiland it narrows to less than 2 miles ; the shore may everywhere be approached to within 2 cables, on either side of the sound, except between Karken islet and Oi fiord, where a rock carrying 4 fathoms lies about 3 cables off shore. * According to the Norwegian Almanac it is high water, full and change, at Hammer fest, at about 2h.

DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When proceeding through SSrS-sund from Alten, steer E. by N. for 15 miles from a position 2 miles south of Lille Haaen, the vessel will then be near a small islet named Vatneholm, which lies about 4 cables from SSrS; the high island Haajen will bear about N.E. | E. distant 13 miles; and a smaller island, Hjelmen, which looks very like a beehive, will be seen to the westward of Haajen. There are passages on both sides of Vatne holm, but the northern one is narrowed by a shoal, running off the point on the west side of the cove at Vatne. About 1\u00a3 cables east of Vatne holm is a sunken rock with 3 feet on it at low water, and 17 fathoms close to its south side. The Svartvig rocks off Seiland, on the opposite side of the sound, are close in shore and show above water. After passing about 2 cables south aud east of Vatne holm, steer direct for Haajen, giving the north point of Seiland a fair berth, and proceed for the houses ou Fuglen\u00e6s, taking care to avoid Molvigbo. The south side of Hjelmen, kept in sight southward of Haajen is an excellent leading mark for the entrance to Hammerfest bay, which is not very easily distinguished. Give Fuglen\u00e6s a fak berth, and bring up either E.S.E. of the consul's house in from 10 to 18 fathoms, or abreast of the warehouses round the harbour, where there is generally a row of small coasting vessels moored head and stern. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Temporary anchorage may be found in almost all the small fiords on the south side of SSrS, eastward of Hasvig ; bu the first fair harbour is the small cove at Vatne, northward of Vatne holm, where there is good anchorage for vessels of moderate size, especially during westerly winds, in 5 to 8 fathoms over sand and clay. The east side of Vatne holm, and the point on the west side of the harbour, must be given a berth of 2 cables. Fella. \u2014 At Fella, 3^ miles north-eastward of Vatne holm, there is a good small harbour with a depth of 5 fathoms over sand ; but it is difficult to leave with southerly winds. A shoal, carrying 6 feet, runs about 2 cables south-westward from the point on the east side of the entrance. Korhavn, on the north side of the projecting point of Seiland south eastward of Fella, has a depth of 5 to 6 fathoms, and is free from dangers ; but is only suitable for northward bound vessels. Grundvaag, on the north end of Seiland, has a depth of 4 fathoms over sand, but is exposed to a swell during northerly winds. K 740. c c"], [420, "402 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. Alten fiord, the largest and best known of the West Finmarken fiords, penetrates about 16 miles inland southward of StjernS and Seiland ; its shores are irregular, forming several large bays and small inlets ; but Lang fiord, which extends 15 miles in a westerly direction to the east side of Alteidet, is the only branch of any extent ; the whole of the fiord and district of Alten is well populated, chiefly by Quains. On the north side of Kaa fiord, which extends about 4 miles westward from the inner part of Alten fiord, are the well known copper works belonging to the Alten Mining Company,* and on the south side of Rafs Bunden, a large bay eastward of the trading station Bosekop, is the mouth of the renowned salmon river Alten. A large fair is held at Bosekop in November and March. The Alten valley, which is the most extensive in Finmarken, has a comparatively mild climate and a productive soil. In summer the thermometer sometimes rises to 57? F. in the shade, and in winter it rarely, if ever, falls below zero, when in many parts of the world, in the same latitude, mercury freezes. Vegetation is remarkable for so high a latitude, the birch, fir, alder, and mountain ash grow and thrive, while barley, potatoes, and other vegetables are successfully raised, this being the most northern point on the globe where agriculture is carried on.f There are numerous cattle and good dairies. Geology. \u2014 The geology of this part of Norway has, from its metal lurgical importance, naturally attracted more attention than that of most equally remote parts, but the relations of the rocks are intricate and obscure, therefore not to be lightly judged of by casual visitors. The islands of StjernS aud Seiland present the same geological features as the great peninsula of the JSkels-fjeld, of which they form the continuation, the prevalent gneiss formation being interspersed with outbreaks of hypers thene rock. The rocks in the vicinity of Kaa fiord are all more or less rounded and scored by external abrasion. The ore from the Kaa fiord copper mines is principally the common yellow copper pyrites ; the rocks consisting of clay, slate, limestone, and hypersthene rock, to which may be added a peculiar sort of sandstone or granular quartz, which, according to Von Buch and Keilhau, succeeds the gneissic formation near Talvig on the west, and Altn\u00e6s on the eastern shore of the Alten fiord, and extends a long way into the interior. The space between Bosekop and Alten river * The officers of the Alten Mining Company have done much good in this neighbour hood ; they import articles of clothing, food, &c, for the benefit of their workpeople, and a church was expressly built for them by the late Sir J. W. Crowe. They are also most kind and hospitable to travellers, and are sometimes able to supply vessels with coal. f The rapidity of vegetable growth at Alten is marvellous, barley will grow 2j inches and peas 3 inches in 24 hours for several consecutive days, and this too in about the same latitude as Disko and the ice-bound regions of Boothia."], [421, "CHAP, xvi.] 403 ALTEN FIORD \u2014 STJERN STJND. is chiefly alluvial sand.* Near Alten, the marine terraces, or ancient sea beaches, which have been traced for a great distance along the coast of Norway, have the remarkable peculiarity that they are not continuous at the same exact level above the present sea, but incline in such a way as to show that the coast has not only been raised bodily out of the water, but in an unequal manner, the part towards Hammerfest having emerged less than the part towards Bosekop. ENTRANCES. \u2014 The entrances to Alten fiord are Stjern-sund, which separates StjernS from the mainland ; Rogn-sund between StjernS and Seiland ; and Varg-sund, which separates Seiland from the mainland and KvalS. Tides. \u2014 The tidal streams are very strong in all these channels, but especially in Rogn-sund, which is not only shallower than the two others, but also receives the greater part of the fresh water from the rivers in Alten fiord. At low water the flood stream begins to run in through Stjern-sund and Rogn-sund to the eastward and southward, but splits off Korsn\u00e6s, one branch running southward into Alten fiord, and the other north-eastward through Varg-sund.' About 3 hours after low water the tide turns in Varg-sund, and the streams from all three sounds then run into Alten fiord. At high water, the tide turns in Alten fiord, Rogn-sund, and Stjern-sund, and runs out to the northward and westward, but does not turn in Varg-sund till 3 hours later, when it again runs to the north-eastward for 6 hours. Southward of Korsn\u00e6s there is but little tide, and the freshes cause a continual northerly current during the greater part of the summer ; they have also a perceptible influence on the tides in Rogn-sund, where the streams run much stronger to the northward than to the southward. DIRECTIONS through STJERN-SUND\u2014 Stjern-sund is clear close up to the land orr either side, but when entering from Alten, care must be taken to avoid Nusfiordbo, the northern extreme of which lies 1^ miles from the point on the east side of the entrance to Nus fiord ; shoal ground also extends from 2 to 4 cables off Stjernfoden, the north-west side of StjernS. Klubben\u00e6s-tind, a remarkable sugar-loaf mountain on the south side of the entrance to Stjern-sund, bearing S.E. by S., or Klubben\u00e6s bearing S.E., will lead northward of Nusfiordbo. The wind is very unsteady in Stjern-sund, calms and heavy squalls alterna ting in rapid succession. * It was here that a base of about 1,200 fathoms was measured in 1853 by MM. Lindhagen and Klouman, in connexion with the measurement of an arc of the meridian from Hammerfest to Tornea, the northern division of the arc already mentioned, (page 399). The Norwegian part of the arc, from Hammerfest to Kautokeino extends through 1\u00b0 46' of latitude. CC 2"], [422, "404 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. When proceeding from Stjern-sund to Alten-fiord, vessels should give the points north and south of Lang fiord a fair berth. Korsn\u00e6sgrund, a shoal off the point on the east side of the entrance to Alten fiord, is marked by an iron pole. There are several small rocks and islets about l|r miles north-westward of the headland between Kaa fiord and Rafs Bunden ; southward of these are two shoals, which are almost awash at low water, but they would only be dangerous to vessels beating in or out. Indreskjer and Brandholmskjer are marked by iron poles. Oskarn\u00e6s, on the north side of the entrance to Kaa fiord, should be given a wide berth, as it runs off shoal ; the opposite shore is bluff, and many be approached with safety. ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Ul fiord, on the east side of LSrsn\u00e6s, is shallow, and has no anchorage. The first harbour eastward of North Bergs fiord, is on the south side of a projecting point on the east side of Nufs fiord ; it is only suitable for small vessels, and is exposed to heavy squalls.* OX FIORD. \u2014 Eastward of Klubben\u00e6s-tind is the entrance to Ox fiord, which penetrates 10 miles into the JSkels-fjeld peninsula. There is anchorage on both sides of this inlet about 2 miles from the entrance ; that on the east side is in a small bay off the outlet of Vasdalen, a large ravine extending about 3 miles inland, j The best berth for vessels of the larger class is in 6 to 10 fathoms over sand, a little eastwardof the Ox fiord trading station, a flourishing establishment belonging to Herr Wilhelm Buck. All ordinary supplies may be obtained here, as well as good water ; the harbour is consequently much frequented by Russian traders, coasters, and fishing craft. It is also of some importance as a place of refuge to vessels that may be driven into Alten during bad weather, as it is often comparatively calm in Ox fiord, and the water is smooth when a hard gale is blowing outside, and even in Stjern-sund. Sometimes, but rarely, south easterly winds sweep through Vasdalen with great violence, and it is then necessary to shift berth to Tver fiord, the harbour on the opposite side ; there is also anchorage about 4 miles farther in. There are no dangers in the harbour off Vasdalen, but when entering Ox fiord it is necessary to giVe Klubben\u00e6s and Ysn\u00e6s a fair berth. Lille and Store Lokker fiords. \u2014 On the south side of Stjern sund, there is anchorage eastward of Ox fiord in Lille and Store Lokker fiords ; the latter is the best harbour, but the inner part is shallow ; the bottom consists of sand. Sima-vig and Halvar-Vig, the harbours on the north side of Stjern-sund, are open to southerly Vinds, which however do not blow home. * One of the glaciers in Nufs fiord descends to within a short distance of the sea. \u25a0f At the upper end of Vasdalen is a considerable lake, which is dammed up by an ancient moraine."], [423, "CHAP.

Talvig, a trading station 5 miles southward of Voldstranden, is a very fair harbour, even for large vessels; the depth varies from 4 to 15 fathoms over sand and clay. The best berth is on the north-east side of the bight. Aar6 and Dybvig. \u2014 On the south-east side of AarS,* there is a good but small harbour with a depth of 5 fathoms ; and about 3 miles south eastward of AarS there is anchorage in 5 fathoms at Dybvig, but a shoal lies off the warehouse. Bosekop, on the east side of the entrance to Kaa fiord, has a small harbour with a depth of 5 fathoms over good holding ground. Kaa fiord. \u2014 The inner part of Kaa fiord is divided into two basins, the entrance to which is through a very narrow channel, with only 18 feet in it at high water. The inner basin is small and shallow, but the outer one is deep and large, and forms an excellent harbour. Vessels bound to the copper works, either anchor at the smelting house to discharge coal or load with ore, or off the warehouse within the church. There are 4 to 5 fathoms near the shore at low water, but the bottom is rather hard. Off the point under the church there are two rocks which cover at high water ; the outer one lies about 25 fathoms from the shore.\")\" There are 25 fathoms on the north side of Kaa fiord, outside the entrance to the Coppermine basin, but too close to the shore for single anchor ; on the south side there are 21 fathoms at a distance of one to 2 cables off shore, and within that the water shoals gradually to 10, 8, and 7 fathoms, close up to the rocks.J There is also anchorage on the south side of Oskarn\u00e6s where vessels will be well sheltered from northerly winds. The tidal streams run very strong through the entrance to the Coppermine basin ; but the ebb runs out in a narrow stream through the middle of Kas fiord, and is hardly felt towards the sides. Rafs Bunden has no regular anchorage, and the south side of the bay is occupied by alluvial banks, which are dry in places, and extend about one mile from the islets at the mouth of the Alten river.

Junkerhavn, on the west side of Seiland, is a small but good harbour, with a depth of 4 fathoms. On the opposite side of the sound, there is good anchorage in Kval fiord, and also in the next bight to the northward, but there is a rock on each side of the entrance to the latter, and it is difficult to leave either of these places under sail. VARG-SUND. \u2014 Between Seiland and the mainland, Varg-sund is quite free from dangers, and is one mile broad in the narrowest places ; towards Hammerfest, however, the channel is narrow and intricate, there fore dangerous for a large vessel should a fog set in. Between 5 and 8 cables north of Komagn\u00e6s is a shoal carrying 3 fathoms ; Sjaaholmskjer, which lies three-quarters of a mile south-west of Sjaaholm, is marked by an hon pole, and Lysgrund, which lies three-quarters of a mile south of Klokker holm, and the same distance from KvalS, carries 5 fathoms. The narrows between KvalS and the north end of Seiland are known as StrSmmen, from the rapid currents that run through them. In the southern part of Varg-sund there is anchorage in 6 fathoms, over good holding ground, off the trading station on the south side of Komag fiord, which runs one mile into the mainland ; and on the south side of the small islet in Older fiord, on the south-east side of Seiland, in 4 to 5 fathoms over sand and clay. Temporary anchorage may also be found in several parts of the sound. At Kvisn\u00e6s on Seiland, 2 miles southward of StrSmmen, there is a good small harbour with a depth of 5 to 7 fathoms over sand. StSvel-havn, on the west side of the south entrance to StrSmmen, has a depth of 8 to 9 fathoms, and is a good stopping place for vessels unable to stem the tide, but the bank is rather steep. There is also anchorage, in 3 to 5 fathoms over sand, in Klokkerholm-havn, south of the projecting point on the east side of StrSmmen ; the east side of Klokkerholm must be given a good berth, and there is no passage between the islet and point.* COAST.

The coast of Soro is generally high, and presents a broken appear ance of bold steep headlends separated by deep inlets. Near the east end of Soro is the remarkably craggy islet BondS, and 2 miles south-eastward of Bondo are the islands Store and Lille KamS, which, as well as KjSd vikfjeld, will be known by their jagged and peaked summits. Eastward of KjSdvikfjeld, which is the north-east point of SSrS, and nearly in the middle of the broad opening between SSrS and RolfsS, is the high rounded islet Skibsholm, and 2 miles southward of Skibsholm is the flat and low islet R\u00e6vsholm. These islets, though not visible at a great distance, are excellent marks for the entrance to Hammerfest. RolfsS and IngS, as well as HjelmsS, are high and mountainous, there fore visible from a considerable distance. HjelmsS is very steep towards the sea, and on the north end is a high rocky pinnacle named HjelmsSs tauren, which rises nearly perpendicularly from the sea, and is easily dis tinguished when seen from the north-eastward. Off the western part of MagerSen are the Stapper or Stappen islands, which, though small, are high and precipitous; Stappestauren, which forms the western part of Store Stappen, has the same remarkable formation as HjelmsSstauren. KNIVSKJERODDEN.\u2014 The long low projecting point, Knivsk- jerodden, though undoubtedly the northernmost extremity of MagerSen, and consequently of Europe, is much less conspicuous, and therefore less cele brated, than the North Cape, which is flat on the top and very steep towards the sea. When a vessel is sufficiently near the coast for the North Cape to be seen over Knivskjerodden, MagerSen will be easily recognised as the land's end. According to the latest Norwegian determinations the northern extreme of Knivskjerodden is in latitude 71\u00b0 11' 0\" N., longitude 25\u00b0 40' 0\" E., and that of the North Cape is in latitude 71\u00b0 10' 25\" N., longitude 25\u00b0 45' 45\" E. LIGHT. \u2014 On Fruholm, a small islet north of IngS, stands a circular iron tower 62 feet high, from which a fixed white fight is exhibited from the 25th of August to the 1st of April. The light is elevated 141 feet, and in clear weather should be visible from a distance of 19 miles. The lighthouse is painted red with a white belt. Beacon. \u2014 A conspicuous stone beacon, built in ledges or steps, has been erected on the northern part of KjSdvikfjeld. Pilots may be obtained from Fruholm or Akker fiord, at the east end of SSrS. A pilot is also stationed at Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r, 8 miles westward of the North Cape. Tides. \u2014 Outside the islands the flood stream runs 9 hours to the north east, and the ebb 3^ hours to the south-west.* Within the islands the tides * Remarks by the late Sir J. W. Crowe."], [426, "408 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. are regular, but there is a tide and half-tide, that is, the streams do not turn in mid-channel till three hours after high and low water by the shore, being gradually propelled from the sides towards the middle of the channel as the tides make. The tides are much stronger than might be expected, consi dering the depth of the water, and the line between the opposing streams is generally distinctly marked by ripplings and whirls, which in calm weather will turn small vessels round.* The direction and velocity of the tidal streams depend very much upon local conditions and the strength of the wind. The ordinary rise and fall is from 5 to 6 feet. Brondseraas, a bank about 15 miles north-eastward of Renlibo and Sildbo, has 21 fathoms on the shallowest spot found, which bears N.W. by W. distant 9 miles from BondS ; it is not steep, and according to the fishermen, never breaks. NORTH COAST Of SORO.\u2014 Although there are no outlying dangers off the north coast of SSrS, it is a dangerous lee shore during northerly gales, for as the inlets by which it is indented are fully exposed to the open sea, there is no secure harbour between Alten and Akker fiord. Between the Sand islands in SandS fiord, a large inlet southward of BondS, and westward of some small islets on the west side of Fin fiord, which runs in eastward of 'KamS, there are harbours of refuge for the smaller class of vessels ; but they are exposed to violent squalls, and also to the heavy sea that runs in with westerly and northerly gales. ENTRANCE EAST Of SORO\u2014 The best marks for the en- trance eastward of SSrS are the islands of BondS and KamS, KjSdvikfjeld with the projecting headland Tarhalsen. and the islets Skibsholm and R\u00e6vs holm. If these can be distinguished there is no difficulty in entering, but in thick weather the two following shoals are extremely dangerous. TUBOEN, a shoal which lies between 6 and 7 miles north-westward of Skibsholm, and the same distance N.N.E. of Tarhalsen, is nearly 1\u00a3 miles in diameter, and breaks in many places, the depths on it varying from 3 to 6 and 8 fathoms. From Tuboen, the west side of KamS is in line with Staalet, a high cliff on the west side of SandS fiord ; the outer extreme of Tarhalsen is in line with Veivig in Gamvig fiord ; and Skibsholm is in line with BjSrnS, which lies 5 miles southward of RolfsS. The shoal is so broad that BjSrnS open east or west of Skibsholm only just clears it. Fruholm light bearing E. by N. leads northward of Tuboen. FALDET. \u2014 About 2\\ miles N. by E. \u00a3 E. from the outer extreme of Tarhalsen is the small but dangerous shoal Faldet, which carries 2 fathoms, and lies right in the fairway. From it, Tarhalsen is iu line with * In July 1874 the yacht Annie was carried from Kvalo to Hjelmsbstauren during a dead calm, varied by very light baffling flaws, in less than 48 hours, only towing as requisite to work the tides. \u2014 Lieut.

Snoals off R\u00e6vsholm. \u2014 There are several shoals round R\u00e6vs holm, but they will be avoided by giving that islet a berth of 2 miles. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Having passed north of the Outer Gj\u00e6sboen, as directed (page 387), a vessel bound to Hammerfest through -the entrance east of SSrS, should steer E. by N. northerly, which will lead between 6 and 7 miles north of FuglS up to BondS. BondSskjer, which lies W. S. 1| miles from the south point of BondS, is steep-to all round, but a shoal lies half a mile off the north end of BondS. R\u00e6vsholm bearing northward of E. by S. A S., will lead southward of Faldet ; Skibsholm kept between the bearings of E. by S. and S.E. by E. E. will lead between Faldet and Tuboen ; and Skibsholm bearing S.E. by S. will lead eastward of Tuboen. After passing 2 miles west or east of R\u00e6vsholm, course may be altered for the high land of Mylingen, on the north end of KvalS. There are no dangers off the east side of SSrS, but if turning to windward between Skibsholm and RolfsS, care must be taken to avoid a 2-fathom patch lying S. by W. nearly half a mile from Stoppelfiordn\u00e6ring. When well past Akker point, Hjelmen and Haajen will be easily recog nised, and MelkS will make like a low projecting point. A rocky shoal extends nearly 2 cables from MelkSskagen, the south-west extreme of MelkS, but it is marked by an iron pillar. From thence the channel is clear up to Hammerfest harbour, and it is only necessary to avoid Molvikbo. Small vessels may pass through MelkS-sund, keeping close to the north side of MelkS ; this passage is shoal and very narrow, therefore, not fit for strangers. A sunken rock in MelkS-sund is marked by an iron pillar. Anchorage. \u2014 On the east side of Akkerfiord (which is the north eastern inlet on the south side of SSrS) there is a harbour with 5 to 6 fathoms over sand ; and southward bound vessels will find anchorage on the east side of Skibn\u00e6sfiord, 4 miles N.N.W. of Haajen, in 3 to 4 fathoms ; but the depth increases rapidly towards the centre of the fiord. The harbour at ForsSl, on the east side of the north end of KvalS, is only suitable for small northward bound vessels, beiug narrow and exposed to northerly winds; it is necessary to keep close to ForsSIS, to avoid a shoal off Sten bitskjer, and there is a rock off the point on the east side of the cove, where there are 4 or 5 fathoms over sand. Kval-SUnd, which separates KvalS from the mainland, is principally used by boats and Russian fish-traders. It is everywhere free from dangers, but the southern part is very narrow. The only anchorage in the sound is off the merchant's house at Kvalsund, on the west side of the entrance to"], [428, "410 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [chap. xvi. Reppe fiord ; it has a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms over sand, but is exposed to northerly winds. From Kvalsund, vessels may proceed through Varg sund, either to Hammerfest or Alten fiord. From Reppe fiord, which extends 8 miles south-eastward from Kval sund, there is an overland route across Reppefiordeide to Russemark and Kistrand in Porsanger fiord ; as there is no beaten track, and the way lies among hills and morasses, intersected by numerous unbridged streams, it is a long and tedious journey ; the distance is about 20 miles. IngO Havn, on the north side of IngS, is very conveniently situated for vessels bound round the North Cape aud obliged to seek shelter. The harbour is somewhat open to the north-west, and when the wind is in that quarter it is difficult to get to sea under sail. The entrance is between Fruholm lighthouse and Stabben rock, and after passing westward of Seiskjer, which constantly breaks, a projecting point will be seen to the southward ; keep close to the outer extreme of this point to avoid the rocks to the eastward, and bring up in the middle of the harbour, right opposite the house at Ytre Inga, in 8 to 10 fathoms over sand. Two rocks in Ingo-havn are marked by iron poles. Vessels not drawing more than 6 feet will find an excellent harbour farther in, off the house at Sandvig, to which there is also an entrance between Svartoxen and KartSskjer. A beacon has been built to mark this entrance, but the only directions that can be given to strangers are to keep a sharp look-out and steer for light bottom, avoiding the dark patches. ROLFSO-SUND. \u2014 The entrance between IngS and HjelmsS, and through RolfsS-sund, a broad clear channel between RolfsS and RenS, is easy and clear ; it is only necessary to give the islets and rocks off the east side of IngS a good berth, and to avoid GjetSskjer, off the west side of HjelmsS. Anchorage may be found in HavS-sund, RolfsS-havn, and Bustad-sund. There is also a stopping place, with a depth of 3 to 5 fathoms over sand, on the south side of Lille LatS, but it is open to southerly winds. Hav6-SUnd. \u2014 When entering HavS-sund from the westward, vessels should keep over towards the mainland, as the deepest water is on the south side of the sound, and rocky ground runs off the south-west side of HavS. The shallowest part of the sound is southward of HavS church, where there are only 2A fathoms at half tide. There is anchorage in the western part of the sound in from 2A to 4 fathoms over sand ; but eastward of the merchant's house, where the tides are not so strong, there are only 2 fathoms at low water. Rolfso Havn, on the south-east side of RolfsS, is the only harbour in the whole island, and is so exposed that it should only be resorted to in fine summer weather. The holding ground is good, but the depth is greater"], [429, "CHAP. XVI.] INGO HAVN STUKEBO. 411 on the north than on the south side of the harbour. The point on the south side of the entrance must be given a berth of 2 cables, as a shoal runs off it. Bustad-SUnd, between RenS and the mainland, is free from dangers, but a shoal runs nearly 2 cables off the north-eastern extreme of RenS. On the south side of the sound is a small land-locked harbour, which however is exposed to squalls off the surrounding hills, and as the entrance is extremely narrow, it is almost exclusively used by Russian fish traders in tending to remain some time. Vessels should not anchor northward of mid-channel, as a rocky ledge runs off the northern shore ; the depth varies from 8 to 15 fathoms, over sand. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels from the eastward might stand into the north-west coast of MagerSen, and either seek anchorage in Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r or proceed between HjelmsS and the low island MaasS, and through Bred sund, to RolfsS-sund. Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r Havn. \u2014 With the exception ofthe Stapper, the numerous islets forming the trading and fishing station of Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r are low and flat, therefore strangers should not stand in amongst them until the pilot comes off. Entering Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r havn from the north-eastward, pass nearly half a mile north and west of Langskjer, which lies off the north western extreme of MagerSen, W. by S. J S. 3 miles from Knivskjerodden, and continue between Bog-Stappen and LysS, giving the west side of the latter a berth of at least 2 cables. The rocks north-east of Refsholm and BokS will be avoided, by keeping Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6rn\u00e6ring open south of Refsholm and north of the highest part of Store LyngS. Give the east point of Sandholm a berth of 2 cables, and bring up north-east of LyngSskjer, a small rock off Store LyngS, in 6 to 8 fathoms ; small vessels may anchor in the bight at Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r in 3 to 4 fathoms over sand. Entering Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r havn from the westward, pass at least one cable north ward of Leikua and Molvigholm ; then steer for Sandholm, giving the north side of Store LyngS a fair berth, and bring up when north-eastward of LyngSskjer. If intending to anchor in the bight at Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r, steer for the round holm south of Store LyngS, when well past Molvigholm ; pro ceed for the rock off the east end of Store LyngS, and do not haul into the bight until it is well open. This passage should not be attempted by strangers. Four of the most dangerous sunken rocks in the above passages are marked by iron poles. StukebO. \u2014 H intending to pass northward of Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r and the Stapper, after rounding the north side of MagerSen, care must be taken to avoid Stukebo, which lies N.E. f E. IA miles from the northern extreme of Store Stappen, and carries 4 fathoms. The marks for it are Langskjer in line"], [430, "412 NORTH KVALO TO THE NORTH CAPE. [CHAP. XVI. with the cleft on the inner part of Knivskjerodden, or MaasS-Kalv in line with the north-west side of Stappestauren, and the eastern shoulder of Store Stappen in line with the peak on Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6rn\u00e6ring. Outer and Inner Stappe Shoals. \u2014 These shoals carry 15 and 11 fathoms respectively, and lie 5\\ and 3| miles N. \\ E. from the eastern extreme of MaasS, with that point in line with Slottet hill, on the west side of Rygge fiord.

If the wind is fair, a vessel may pass southward of these shoals by steering direct for MaasS-Kalv, from about one mile west of Stappestauren. Bred-SUnd, between HjelmsS and HavS, is free from dangers, but has no anchorage ; vessels drawing less than 12 feet would, however, find shelter in HavS-sund. When entering Bred-sund from the north-eastward it is only necessary to give the north-west extreme of MaasS a berth of nearly half a mile after passing west of MaasS-Kalv, and to keep StrSmsn\u00e6s bearing a little westward of S.W., in order to avoid the shoals off the east side of HjelmsS. Between Mageroen and Maaso.\u2014 After passing the Stapper and Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6rn\u00e6ring, vessels might, if considered advisable, proceed between MagerSen and MaasS to MaasS-sund or MagerS-sund. The western extreme of MagerSen, and the east side of MaasS, should be given a berth of half a mile ; and care^must be taken to avoid Torveskallen, which lies IA miles east of Torven\u00e6s, and frequently breaks. Graakold Bugt, on the west side of MagerSen, is au indifferent har bour, with a depth of 5 to 7 fathoms over sand. There are two entrances, but that from the northward through Vandholmsund is very narrow, and can only be used in calm weather on account of the ground swell ; when taking it, vessels should pass half a cable east of Skarveskjer. Vand fiord. \u2014 On the north side of Vand fiord, a large inlet 2 miles south of Graakold fjeld, there is anchorage off a house named V\u00e6rrc in 3 fathoms, shoaling towards the inner part of the bight, over sand. Ostvaag and V\u00e6rre. \u2014 In Ostvaag, on the south-east side of Maaso, there are 3 to 4 fathoms over sand ; and in a bight named V\u00e6rre, 3 miles south of Torven\u00e6s, the point on the north side of Ostvaag, there are 3 fathoms over sand ; these harbours afford very little protection from easterly winds. Maas6-SUnd, which connects Bred-sund and MagerS-sund, is quite clear. Kj\u00e6rring-grund, half a mile eastward of Holmen, on the south side of the sound, carries 7 fathoms."], [431, "CHAP. XVI.] 413 STAPPE SHOALS \u2014 KJELVIG. Mager6-SUnd, between MagerSen and the mainland, is narrow, but free from dangers. The streams turn 3 hours after high and low water in MagerS-sund, the flood setting eastward from half flood to half ebb, and the ebb westward from half ebb to half flood. In MagerS-sund are the following anchorages : \u2014 Stikkelvaag Havn, southward of Vand fiord, is a good, small har bour with a depth of 4 to 7 fathoms over sand ; the best berth is near the small holm in the inner part of the bight. La fiord. \u2014 On the east side of La fiord there is also a good small harbour, especially for vessels proceeding westward ; a little south of the gamme, or Lapp hut, there are 4 to 5 fathoms over clay. Lille Vein\u00e6s Bugt, on the west side of the entrance to Sarn\u00e6s Pollen, a large bay on the south side of MagerSen, has good holding ground, but is open to easterly winds. SarnseS Pollen. \u2014 East of the islet in the inner part of Sarn\u00e6s Pollen there is good anchorage in 9 to 15 fathoms; the inner part of the creek is shoal. Sarn\u00e6s. \u2014 The small harbour on the north side of Sarn\u00e6s, east of Sarn\u00e6s Pollen, has a depth of 4 fathoms, and may be entered from the east ward or westward ; but as a shoal spit of sand runs nearly 2 cables off the north-west point of the islet between Altesula and MagerSen, the eastern entrance is the best. Altesula. \u2014 Between Altesula and the islet off Sarn\u00e6s there is anchorage in 6 to 10 fathoms over sand, and although open to the eastward it is spacious, and may be easily left with any wind. The north side of Altesula should not be approached nearer than 2 cables, as a rocky shoal runs off it. Sondre HonningSVaag. \u2014 On the east side of SSndre on South Honningsvaag, the inlet east of Altesula, is a good small harbour with a depth of 4 fathoms over sand, which is especially convenient for vessels going westward. Kjelvig. \u2014 Vessels bound to the eastward would find indifferent an chorage in Kjelvig, a peculiar cauldron-shaped hollow in the high land on the eastern extreme of MagerSen ; but it is exposed to violent squalls, and a swell is felt during north-easterly winds. The depth varies from 6 to 15 fathoms on the south and north sides of the cove; the islet in the en trance may be passed on either side.

GENERAL REMARKS.*\u2014 From MagerSen to Jacob river, which separates the coasts of Finmarken and Russian Lapland, the mainland is entirely unprotected by islands ; MagerS-sund is therefore the northern termination of the Inner Lead. The great inlets Porsanger, Laxe, Tana, and Varanger fiords, which, with their minor branches, penetrate the north-eastern part of Finmarken, also divide it into large peninsulas, which again are indented by smaller inlets extending from one to 10 miles inland. The largest of these penin sulas are (Jorgas-Njarga, between Laxe and Tana fiords, and the Varanger HalvS or peninsula Varjo Njarga. (^orgas-Njarga is connected with the mainland by a low isthmus named Hops-eide, which is barely half a mile broad between the inner extremes of the Eids and Hops fiords. Varanger HalvS, which is the largest peninsula in Norway, having a coast line of about 160 miles, is bounded on the west by Tana fiord and river, on the north and east by the Barentz sea, and on the south by Varanger fiord ; it is connected with the mainland by an isthmus named Eidet or Var anger-fjeld, which is about 9 miles broad, between Seida and Nyborg, and 500 feet high.f * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Norway, sheets XIV. and XV., North cape to Tana fiord and Tana fiord to Varanger fiord, Nos. 2,316 and 2,317. Note. \u2014 The Lappish as well as the Norwegian names of many places are given in these charts as they are not unfrequently used by the fishermen. f In 1860, a fence, 6 feet high, was constructed across Varanger-fjeld to prevent the reindeer from returning to their old winter quarters and being confiscated or shot by Russian officials. The agreement made in 1751, by which the Norwegian Lapps were allowed to pasture their reindeer on Russian territory during the winter, while the Russian Lapps migrated with their herds to Norway in summer, having been suddenly repudiated by the Russian Government in 1852. In consequence of this severe measure, which principally affected those who were least able to bear it, the Norwegian nomadic Lapps, the number of tame reindeer decreased in 10 years, 1855-65, from 12,815 to 4,282 in the parish of Syd- Varanger, from 15,663 to 9,252 in that of N\u00e6sseby, and from 83,554 to 65,090 in the whole of Finmarken."], [433, "415 CHAP. XVII.] GENERAL REMARKS. On the east and south coasts of Varanger peninsula are the towns of VardS and VardsS. Tides. \u2014 From the North Cape to VardS, the general direction of the flood stream is easterly, and of the ebb westerly, the east-going stream being the stronger. The ordinary rise and fall is about 6 feet. The NORTH CAPE * of Norway is the highest and most con spicuous headland on the north coast of MagerSen, and is therefore a more important landmark than Knivskjerodden. It is a bold black headland with a smooth, flat summit, and is composed of nearly vertical strata of mica slate, cut off at exactly the same level. The highest point of the plateau is 1,005 feet above the level of the sea, and the outermost edge is very little lower. Although frequently represented as a perpendicular, and even overhanging cliff, the North Cape really slopes at an angle of 50\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 from the horizontal, but may be somewhat steeper towards the upper edge. A remarkable pointed crag or spur named Hornet, which strikingly resembles the horn of a rhinoceros, projects from the eastern slope of the cape, and on a mound near the northern edge of the summit is an obelisk of hewn granite, which with its pedestal is 8 feet high.f Vessels might bring up for a few hours, in about 20 fathoms, in Hornvik, a small bight on the east side of the North Cape, but only in calm weather. J North Cape to Nord Kyn. \u2014 There is a great deal of similarity in the headlands on the north-east coast of Finmarken, all being dark, precipitous, and barren, with deeply furrowed sides and level summits, cut off at an altitude of about 1,000 feet; they are, therefore, not easily dis tinguished from a long distance, but the openings of the fiords are almost unmistakable. When approaching North Cape, either from the westward or eastward, MagerSen will be easily recognised as the land's end. Skarsvaagn\u00e6ring, the headland east of North Cape, is also high, dark, and table-topped, but has a peculiar hollow or recess, like an amphitheatre, in the middle, and there is a small but high island, Store Skikka, 1^ miles to the north-westward. From thence to the east point of MagerSen the coast is hilly and uneven. East of MagerSen the broad entrances to Porsanger and Laxe fiords are very conspicuous ; they are separated by a projecting mass of high land named Spierta Njarga, which, when seen from the sea, appears to form an unbroken and almost horizontal ridge, terminating in the lofty precipi tous cape S v\u00e6rholtklubb. When seen from a distance Sv\u00e6rholtklubb appears detached, and, during the summer, quite white, as if covered with snow, * In Norwegian \" Nordkap.\" f Erected in commemoration of H.M.

(true), distant 36 miles from the North Cape, to which it has some resemblance. When seen from the northward, however, Nord Kyn shows a rounded and more gradual slope to the eastward, while the west side is steep and abrupt. Coast. \u2014 Eastward of Nord Kyn the coast of (^orgas-Njarga is rugged, precipitous, and irregular, with several large projecting points and bays, but does not present any conspicuous landmarks. The land south of Sletn\u00e6s, 10 miles E. by S. S. from Nord Kyn, is quite low, and therefore not easily seen ; the nearest hills rise at some distance inland. At Omgangsklubb, on the north side of the entrance to Tana fiord, the land is higher, but still without any noticeable features. The entrance to Tana fiord is narrower and less conspicuous than the openings of Porsanger and Laxe fiords, although the land in its vicinity is higher. TANAHORN, on the south side of the entrance to Tana fiord, is the best landmark on this part of the coast ; it is a steep, dark, conical hill 865 feet high, and forms a striking contrast to the land around, more especially to that on the west side of the fiord, which is much lower, and generally has the appearance of being covered with snow. When within a distance of 20 miles, on a W. S.W. bearing, Tanahorn will make like an island, but when seen from a greater distance it cannot be distinguished from the high level mountains further inland. * Sv\u00e6rholtklubb is the most remarkable \" fugle-bjerg \" or \" loomery \" in Norway, and perhaps in the world. The rock falls almost perpendicularly, and forms a series of narrow ledges 2 or 3 feet apart, rising like a gigantic flight of stairs to the height of about 1,000 feet. On these ledges, which extend along the face of the cliff for more than a mile, are perched millions of sea birds in horizontal rows, their white breasts contrasting strongly with the black rock behind. On firing a gun, or blowing a steam whistle, a roar of wings is heard, mingled with harsh wailing screams, and a dense cloud rises from the face of the rock and literally darkens the sky ; in spite of this, however, the numbers still remaining on the ledges appear to be undiminished. Of the species that breed here the three-toed gull or kittiwake (Larus tridactylus) is the most numerous. The shag or green cormorant (Phalacrocorax cristatus) breeds in great numbers on the lower part of the cliff, while the common guillemot {Uria troile), razor-bill <Alea torda), and puffin {Fratercula arcticd) are also abundant. Amongst the less numerous species may be named the common gull 'Larus canus), the great black-backed gull (i. marinus), the herring gull (L. argentatus), the lesser black backed gull {L. fuscus), and the black guillemot or dovekie {Vria grylle), the summit ofthe cliff being often occupied by a pair of white-tailed eagles (Hali\u0153etus or Aquila albicilla'). The skuas tLestrin\u0153}, and various species of gulls, auks, guillemots, terns, and other sea-fowl too numerous to be mentioned here, as well as rare falcons and hawks, are also found on many of the cliffs of Finmarken."], [435, "417 CHAP. XVII.] NORD KTN TO VARDO. Coast. \u2014 From Tanahorn the coast trends generally in a S.E. by E. direction for about 50 miles to VardS, and presents the appearance of a nearly horizontal ridge 400 or 500 feet high ; there are no landmarks, neither does the aspect of any particular tract serve as a guide. The' only point that might be noted is Tavlen hill, on the south side of Sylte fiord ; it is conical like Tanahorn, but has a rounder apex. The openings of Ris, Kongs, Baads, Sylte, and Pers fiords may be distinguished at a distance of about 10 miles ; there are two large hills at the head of Ris fiord, which will be visible when the inlet is quite open. Harbaken or Havningberg, a projecting headland between Sylte and Pers fiords, is also a noticeable point, and when bearing eastward of S.S.E. may be recognised at a distance of 25 miles. The general appearance of the country is barren ; hardly a trace of soil or vegetation is visible on the table-lands, and fresh green grass is only found in the clefts of the hills facing the sea. Sleppen bank. \u2014 About half-way between the North Cape and Nord Kyn, and 11 or 12 miles N. by E. from Sv\u00e6rholtklubb, is the well known fishing bank Sleppen, which was surveyed by Lieutenants Motz .feldt and Johansen, of the Norwegian navy in 1842. The shallowest spot found, on which there are 40 fathoms, is in latitude 71\u00b0 9' 45\" N., longi tude 26\u00b0 47' E. Shoals off Sletn\u00e6s and Omgangsklubb.\u2014 It has often been reported that dangerous shoals extended some distance off Sletn\u00e6s, between Nord Kyn and Tana fiord, but the surveying officers could find none except the TSrboerne, which lies within a mile of the shore. Off the entrance to KSi fiord, between Sletn\u00e6s and Omgangsklubb, there are three rocks carry ing from 10 to 16 fathoms, and a rock with 6 fathoms over it lies three quarters of a mile northward of the fishing station at Omgang. According to the soundings laid down on the chart, it is not advisable to stand into less than 60 or 70 fathoms in foggy weather, and as there is very often a heavy sea between Sletn\u00e6s and Omgangsklubb, owing to the strength of the tides and the irregularity of the ground, it is prudent to give this part of the coast a berth of 4 or 5 miles. North Cape to VardO. \u2014 If bound to VardS vessels should steer E. S. from a position north of the North Cape until Nord Kyn bears S.W. A W. distant 8 or 10 miles ; the course is then S.E. by E.

ANCHORAGE. \u2014 Most of the harbours between the North Cape and VardS are small and exposed, therefore, though the absence of out lying dangers renders them easy of access, they should only be sought in case of emergency. They will be described in their natural order. Skarsvaag,t a trading station on the east side of the projecting point Born\u00e6s, is the first harbour eastward of Gj\u00e6sv\u00e6r ; it is chiefly frequented by Russian fish traders, and being open to the northward should only be resorted to in fine summer weather ; the inner part of the bay is shoal, and forms several small lagoons. The best anchorage is north of the point to the eastward of the merchant's house. The marks for Skarsvaagbo, which lies N.N.E. half a mile from Store Skikka, are Skarsvaagn\u00e6ring in line with Heln\u00e6s, and Store Skikka in Une with Born\u00e6s. Store Skikka may be passed on either side at a distance of 2 cables ; there is no passage southward of Lille Skikka. A sunken rock lies about one cable from the northern extreme of Born\u00e6s, and there is a shoal carrying 2\\ fathoms about half-way between that point and the east side of the North Cape, but it is out of the track of vessels. The entrance to Skarsvaag is nearly 3 miles S.S.E. from the eastern extreme of the North Cape. Kamo fiord. \u2014 There is anchorage in KamS fiord between the east side of MagerSen and KamS, but it is small and out of the way. Shoal ground runs a short distance off the south and east sides of KamS, which may be passed on either side. PORS ANGER FIORD penetrates 65 miles inland in a S.W. by S. direction from Sv\u00e6holtklubb. It is seldom visited except by occasional vessels trading to Repvaag, and by Russian \"lodjes\" (small coasters which visit the fishing stations on the northern coasts of Norway to load with * See Directions for making the passage from the Downs to the White Sea, 1858. \u25a0\\ This is the best station from which to ascend the North Cape."], [437, "CHAP. XVII.] 419 SKARSVAAG \u2014 SV\u00c6RHOLT BAY. fish) ; these also chiefly frequent Repvaag, partly because no important fishery is carried on south of TamsS, with the exception of the salmon fisheries in BSrselv and Laxelv, and partly because there are no safe har bours in the neighbourhood of the fishing stations. The coasting steam vessels, however, run regularly up the fiord as far as Kirstrand, about 20 miles southward of Repvaag. The outer part of the fiord is bounded by precipitous and barren table lands, with almost uniformly level summits, and the scenery is sombre and monotonous ; farther in the shores are different in character, the dwarf birch reappears, and the slopes are covered with green pasture. Iron and copper ores having been discovered in the inner part of Porsanger fiord, as well as limestones, it is not improbable that the locality may in time be more frequented than it is at present. In Porsanger, as in most of the fiords of Finmarken, the tide sets in from seaward with the flood, and out with the ebb. Land winds are prevalent in summer, and draw straight out of the fiord. The outer part of Porsanger fiord is from 7 to 10 miles broad, and the only shoals that can be considered dangerous are the East and West Lys bund (Guoustabodni), which lie about S.W. by S., from 2 to 2A miles from the south end of TamsS ; the first carries 6 feet, and the latter 5 to 6 fathoms. Rocky ground extends about 1 \u00a3 miles in a north-westerly direction from the north point of North LangS, and the whole of the inner part of the fiord is very shallow, navigation being further obstructed by a great number of low islands and holms ; the principal passages and harbours are shown on the chart. Vestbotten, the south-western extreme of the fiord, is so shallow that it is only navigable, even for boats, at high water, and is still filling up. The inner part of Porsanger fiord is generally frozen in winter as far out as Osekar holm, and sometimes farther. Repvaag, a large trading station on the west side of Porsanger fiord, about 12 miles southward of MagerS-sund, is the only place of shelter in the outer part of the fiord ; the harbour, though narrow, is good and secure, but difficult to make during westerly winds, which are squally and baflling ; it has a depth of 3 to 6 fathoms, over good holding ground con sisting of clay and sand. Shoal ground runs a short distance off the eastern shore of the harbour, and on the west side, just within the entrance, is a small rock ; vessels should therefore keep as nearly as possible in mid-channel when entering or leaving. Good temporary anchorage may be found on the north side of Vedbotten, nearly a mile northward of Repvaag ; the depth varies from 5 to 7 fathoms, according to the distance from the shore, over clay and sand. Sv\u00e6rholt bay, on the east side of Sv\u00e6rholtklubb, is inhabited, and the construction of a harbour is conterbplated. D D 2"], [438, "420 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. LAXE FIORD, which extends 35 miles in a S. by W. direction from the east side of Sv\u00e6rholtklubb, is generally from 7 to 10 miles broad ; the shores are very irregular, however, and form a succession of bays and inlets, which extend from 1| to 6 miles inland from the main fiord. If vessels can neither weather Sv\u00e6rholtklubb nor reach KjSlle fiord, they may safely run into Laxe fiord, as it is quite clear nearly up to Lebesby, and anchorage may be found either in the Eids or Store Torske fiords; there is also a stopping place in TSmmervig, and a good harbour at Lebesby. In Laxe fiord the tide sets in with the flood, and out with the ebb. Kjolle fiord runs 4 miles inland on the east side of the entrance to Laxe fiord ; the head of this inlet forms a fairly sheltered bay, where there is a fishing and trading station. Vessels may anchor on the south side of this bay in 4 to 5 fathoms, east of the nearest point to the inner end of the fiord ; the point itself must be given a good berth, as a reef runs nearly 2 cables off it to the northward. The best anchorage, especially in winter, is in a bight west of the trading station on the north side of the bay, where there is deep water over sloping ground ; a rock carrying 6 feet, lies about one cable from the south-western shore of the high land west of the bight. Finkirker rocks are nearly isolated from the bold headland on the south side of the entrance to KjSlle fiord ; they resemble a building with square towers, and are said to have been formerly worshipped by the Lapps. Tommervig, a small inlet 13 miles S.W. f W. from the Finkirker, should only be resorted to during westerly winds ; the depths vary between 4 and 10 fathoms, over good holding ground, but the inner part of the bay is shoal. Eids fiord, the principal branch of Laxe fiord, extends about 6 miles in an E.S.E. direction from the large bay south of KjSlle fiord. Having passed on either side of a round rock about 4 miles within the entrance, vessels may anchor according to their draught, the depth decreasing to 3 fathoms towards the creek leading to Hops-eidet. Store Torske Fiord is the northernmost of two small inlets about 9 miles south of the entrance to Eids fiord. The best berth is just within the first point on the south side of the fiord ; but there is also anchorage along the northern shore. The depth is from 4 to 8 fathoms. Lebesby (Lebbesby), about 7 miles south of Store Torske fiord, is the principal place in Laxe fiord ; it is surrounded by pasture land, and the hills are wooded with birch. The harbour south of Lebesby church is good and spacious, but somewhat difficult to make without a pilot, it has a depth of 5 to 8 fathoms over good holding ground. Skjotningberg is a cove 2 miles south-eastward of Kjelsn\u00e6ring, the headland north of KjSlle fiord. Vessels may bring up in about 4 fathoms"], [439, "chap, xvii.] 421 LAXE FIORD \u2014 TANA PIORD. either abreast of, or a little within the trading establishment on the west side of the cove ; but the anchorage is unsafe during northerly or westerly winds, and the shores run off flat and stony. Sand Fiord, a bay on the west side of Nord Kyn, is inhabited, and might afford temporary anchorage during calm weather, but it is fully exposed to the north-west. Kuskj\u00e6lhavn and Mehavn, on the west and east sides of the middle bay south-eastward of Nord Kyn, are small but safe harbours ; the first is used by eastward, and the latter by westward bound vessels ; the inner part of Mehavn is shoal and dries at low water. When entering or leaving these harbours, it is necessary to avoid Kinerod-fluerne, three rocks carrying 3 to 6 fathoms, which lie IA miles W.S.W. from the north and south points of KamS. Stenvaag, a fishing station on the west side of Sletn\u00e6s, is inhabited, but has no anchorage. Gamvig. \u2014 At Gamvig, on the east side of the low land south of Sletn\u00e6s, there is a church and trading station, besides several houses ; and the harbour is much frequented during the spring fisheries. Vessels may pass on either side of Baren shoal, and bring up between the small round islet and the mainland in 5 fathoms. Russian and other coasters of light draught also anchor in the shallow bight farther in. A rock on the north side of Gamvig is marked by a dolphin ; the entrances are difficult, and should not be attempted without the assistance of a pilot, which may be obtained on the spot. Koi fiord. \u2014 There is good anchorage in 6 to 8 fathoms over sand, in a small cove on the east side of the inner part of KSi fiord ; but being out of the way it should only be sought in case of necessity. Vessels may run in on either side of KSiS and the islets to the southward, but the western passage is the clearest. TA.NA FIORD proper penetrates about 26 miles inland, in a south westerly direction, on the west side of the Varanger peninsula. Its shores are abrupt mountain declivities, intersected, especially on the west side, by smaller inlets. The principal branches are Hops, Lang, and Vester Tana fiords, which extend in a westerly and south-westerly direction from the main fiord, at the inner end of which, on the east side, is the mouth of Tana river. This inlet is distinguished from the other fiords of East Finmarken by the comparatively great altitude of the mountains encompassing it, Stangen\u00e6s-fjeld, east of the entrance to the Tana river, attaining a height of 2,300 feet, while Algas-Varre opposite Guldholm, and Digermiilen on the south side of the entrance to Lang fiord, are not much lower. A kind of sandstone quartz is here the prevailing formation ; the rock"], [440, "422 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. consists of white, yellow, and red strata, and crumbles readily when exposed to the atmosphere ; steep naked cliffs, deep chasms, and huge masses of fallen rock and debris, are visible on every side. In consequence of the considerable body of water which Tana river empties into the sea, a strong current almost always runs out through the fiord, especially between the mouth of the river and Molvigskjer. Skar and Hul fiords. \u2014 Between Omgangsklubb and Hops fiord, a distance of 12 miles, the western shore of Tana fiord is steep, inaccessible, and uninhabited ; but between 8 and 10 miles from the entrance there is anchorage in Skar and Hul fiords, which extend A\\ 'miles in a north westerly direction from the main branch. These harbours would afford shelter from south-east gales, and temporary anchorage in' calm weather ; but during strong south-westerly winds, when heavy baffling flaws render it almost impossible to beat in, they should not even be attempted. The anchorage in Skar fiord is at the head of the bay on the north side, in 8 fathoms over sand. In Hul fiord vessels may either anchor near the northern shore, west of a low grassy point just within the entrance, or at the inner end of the fiord ; there are 4 to 8 fathoms over sand at both places. Hops fiord is an irregular inlet extending 10 miles in a W. by N. N. direction from Tana fiord to Hops-eidet. In this branch the tidal streams are irregular, and sometimes very strong ; they depend in great ;measure on the winds prevailing at sea. There are no harbours on the south side of Hops fiord, but anchorage may be found on the north side of the entrance at Ydre and Indre (Outer and Inner) Hop. The outer harbour is open to south-east winds, but is the easiest to get away from under sail ; it has a depth of 12 fathoms over clay. When entering Inner Hop, vessels should keep close to the low point running out from the eastern shore, and bring up on the north side of it in about 20 fathoms over sand. It is necessary to moor well with shore hawsers during westerly winds, which are here very unsteady and violent. At the inner end of Hops fiord there is good anchorage east of Hops-eidet, a trading station on the isthmus of that name ; the best berth is a little north of the houses, in 8 fathoms. A shoal lies about one cable from the northern shore of the fiord, 1^ miles eastward of Hops-eidet. Lang fiord. \u2014 The outer part of Lang fiord extends 8 miles from Digermulen to Suolog\u00e6dje islet, whence it runs 8 miles farther inland in a W. by S. direction. It is considered a very dangerous place during southerly winds, on account of the heavy squalls which then sweep down from Digermulen and the high steep mountains to the westward. Near the middle of the fiord, 2 miles from the entrance, is a solitary rock, from which a shoal runs some distance to the southward. There are three small harbours on the north side of Lang fiord, but none"], [441, "CHAP. XVII.] 423 SKAR FIORD \u2014 TANA RIVER. on the south side. The outer harbour, a small narrow creek named Guolso vuoppi, is inhabited ; when entering or leaving, vessels must keep the southern shore close on board, in order to avoid a rock on the north side of the entrance, within which there are 4 fathoms over sand. Nearly 2 miles westward of Guolsovuoppi is another small creek, with a depth of 4 fathoms over clay ; and 3 miles farther in there is good and safe anchorage, in 4 to 12 fathoms over clay, off the west end of Suolog\u00e6dje, which may be passed on either side. Trold fiord. \u2014 The eastern shore of Tana fiord is steep and almost unbroken, Ydre and Indre Molvig being the only inhabited spots between Tanahorn and Stangen\u00e6s-f j eld. In case of necessity, vessels might anchor on the north side of Trold fiord, a small inlet 5 miles E.S.E. of Digermulen, either just within the two rocks near the entrance, or opposite the Lapp hut farther in. Stangen\u00e6s. \u2014 The anchorage on the south side of Stangen\u00e6s, the south-western extreme of Stangen\u00e6s-fjeld, is protected from all winds blowing into the fiord, but during the autumn a swell is thrown in from seaward, and southerly winds raise a heavy cross sea. Vessels should keep Stangen\u00e6s on board when proceeding to or from the anchorage, as.the banks thrown up by the Tana are not far south ofthe point; these banks undergo annual alteration, and only carry a few feet of water. Tana river. \u2014 This well-known stream is the third river in Norway as regards length of course, and probably the Glommen alone surpasses it in volume ; its valley is richly wooded, but thinly inhabited. The Tana is formed by the junction of the Anarjokka and Karasjokka, and for a long distance constitutes the boundary between Norway and Russia, but at Polmak church, in latitude 70\u00b0 4', the frontier bends abruptly to the south eastward, while the river diverges to the northward and disembogues west of Stangen\u00e6s-fjeld. The lower part of the river, though broad and im posing in appearance, is occupied by extensive banks of mud and sand, which form shallow changeable channels, only navigable for the boats of the country.* * The river boats common to Einmarken and Lapland are roughly built, long, low, narrow, and very light ; they have neither thwarts, rudder, or keel, and float in the shallowest water. Each boat (elebaad) is managed by two men, one sitting in the bow the other in the stern ; the latter faces forward and steers, using either a pair of small oars or a single paddle like a spade. When ascending the river, the boat is kept close to the bank, to avoid the strength of the current, and on coming to a rapid, or \" stryk,\" the men stand up, poles 8 to 10 feet long are substituted for the oars, and the steersman keeps the boat in position while the bowman gets a good purchase, then uniting their efforts the boat is forced a few yards farther up the river. This process is called \" stagning.\" If the rapid or fall is impassable, the boat is dragged past it on a narrow path, which is generally provided with transverse timbers, so that two men can get along easily with an ordinary sized boat. The nicest skill is required to shoot the rapids when going down stream, but an accident is seldom heard of."], [442, "424 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap, xvii, Small craft might ascend the Tana, with the last of the flood, as far as Marienlund, IA miles above the trading station on Guldholm, a small islet opposite the church, 2 miles from the mouth of the river. Generally, how ever, vessels bring up at Stangen\u00e6s. At Seida, 15 miles above Marienlund, there is a Lapp settlement, whence the fjeld may be crossed to Nyborg in 4 or 5 hours. Vester Tana and Smal fiords extend 9 aud 6 miles inland from the inner part of Tana fiord, of which they are in fact continuations. There is no harbour in either of them. Berlevaag, a fishing station 6| miles eastward of Tanahorn, is much frequented by Nordlanders. The harbour is sheltered from south and west winds, but open to those from the north and east, which, however, do not send in much sea, as the reefs at the entrance form a natural breakwater ; the depth is only 2 to 3 fathoms. The coast is shoal nearly half a mile off shore west and east of Berlevaag, and it is necessary to keep near the northern shore when entering the harbour, to avoid the reefs on the south side. Svartoxen, a rock on the north side of the entrance, is marked by a dolphin. KongS fiord. \u2014 There is anchorage in 3 to 4 fathoms over sand on the south side of Vein\u00e6shalseu, the isthmus connecting the small peninsula between the Ris and Kongs fiords with the mainland. The entrances are difficult, and should not be attempted without a pilot, on account of the numerous rocks and shoals off the islets in the outer part of the fiord ; the harbour is therefore seldom used. The western passage is the easiest. At the entrance to Kongs fiord are Kongs islands, noted for their pastures and sea-fowl colonies, and at the inner end of StrSms fiord, which is con nected with Kongs fiord by a very narrow passage, is the StrSms-elv or Gednie-jokka, which is said to afford good fishing. Baads fiord. \u2014 The most secure harbour between Tanahorn and VardS is at the inner end of Baads fiord. When entering the harbour, vessels should give the point on the east side a fair berth, taking care at the same time to avoid a small rock to the westward, and bring up abreast of the houses in 8 to 10 fathoms over clay and sand ; the fiord is free from danger. There is another small harbour three-quarters of a mile to the northward, but the entrance is extremely narrow. Makur, 1 % miles east of the entrance to Baads fiord, is one of the numerous places that were ruined by the former monopoly of the Fin marken trade. It was once a flourishing village, but is now almost deserted, a few fishermen only frequenting it during the spring. Lonfaldene, a cluster of rocks one mile east of Makur, extend nearly half a mile seaward, but the sea nearly always breaks on them. Sylte fiord. \u2014 The harbour at the inner end of Sylte fiord has a depth of 2 to 3 fathoms over sand. The only danger in the fiord is"], [443, "425 CHAP. XVII.] BERLEVAAG \u2014 VARDO. Tavleskjer, which lies about three-quarters of a mile west of Tavlen, and is visible at low water. Vessels must pass westward of Tavleskjer, as a shoal runs off it to the eastward. There are good pastures in inner the part of Sylte fiord, and for some distance up the Orddo-jokka there is said to be a fair growth of birch, but on the shores of the fiord almost every tree has been felled. Note. \u2014 The harbours iu Kongs, Baads, and Sylte fiords are generally used by Russian fish traders only, leaving them under sail being attended with difficulty. Havningberg, on the south side of Harbaken, is one of the best fishing stations in Finmarken, but as the harbour is fully exposed to the eastward, it can only be regarded as a stopping place for vessels pro ceeding west. It has a depth of 3 to 5 fathoms over sand, and as the shore runs off shoal, care must be taken not to stand too far in. Pers fiord, the first inhabited inlet north of VardS, has no anchorage. Although grass thrives here, there are no signs of trees or even bushes. VARDO.* \u2014 The islands of VardS are situated off the eastern extreme of Finmarken, on the north side of the entrance to Varanger fiord. Tke western and largest island, which is separated from the mainland by Busse sund, is divided by two bays, Vest and Ost Vaagen, between which there is only a narrow neck of land. The western division of the island is long and narrow, extending nearly 3 miles in a north and south direction, while the eastern part though higher and broader, hardly exceeds one mile in length ; the north-western extreme is 4 miles south-eastward of Pers fiord. RenS, and HornS, the eastern islands of the group, are kept as \" dun-v\u00e6r,\" or breeding places for the eider duck. Vegetation is almost confined to cloud berries and scurvy grass, which, however, grow luxuriantly, the latter covering many of the house roofs. The town of VardS is chiefly built on the eastern shores of Vest and Ost Vaagen, and is commanded by VardShus, a small fort on the west side of the island.f It was formerly one of the most important fishing stations in northern Norway, but its prosperity declined after the monopoly of the Finmarken trade was granted, and even as late as 1825 the total population was only 160. Of late years, however, the place has risen rapidly, and has now upwards of 1,200 inhabitants. At present the fisheries constitute the chief resource of VardS ; but the situation, security, and capacity of its harbour, as well as the facilities offered for discharging and taking in cargo, and storing goods, would make it a convenient depot for Siberian and White Sea traders. * See plan of Vardo bay on Admiralty chart, No. 2,317. f Said to be the northernmost fortification in the world ; it was erected by Haakon V., probably about 1310."], [444, "426 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. Supplies. \u2014 Good water and supplies of almost every kind may be obtained at VardS, and small vessels may be beached for repairs.* Pilot. \u2014 A branch pilot lives at VardS. VEST VAAGEN. \u2014The harbours of VardS, Vest and Ost Vaagen, run nearly north and south, not west and east as their names imply ; it would therefore be more correct to call them Nordre and Sondre (North and South) Vaagen. The northern bay, Vest Vaagen, is the principal and the best har bour ; it is nearly half a mile long from the point on the east side of the entrance to the neck of land connecting the east and west parts of VardS, and the breadth decreases gradually from about 3 cables at the entrance to one cable near the head of the bay. The depth shoals from 11 fathoms near the entrance to 6 and 2 fathoms farther in. As Vest Vaagen is exposed to northerly winds and sea, serious loss of life and property has been caused by heavy winter gales ; a breakwater, which will enclose a good and safe harbour is, however, in course of construction, and already affords some protection. On the west side of the harbour is a cannon for securing hawsers to, and several mooring buoys have also been laid down. Only small vessels can lie alongside the private jetties fronting the ware houses, but those of large tonnage might load or discharge in any weather alongside the Government pier, where there are 141- feet at low water, and 23 feet at high water, the depth increasing outwards. The pier, which is well protected by the western arm of the breakwater, is connected by a tramway with the level ground outside the fort, and is altogether very convenient ; it must not, however, be used without permission. ENTRANCES. \u2014 Vest Vaagen may be entered either from the northward or south-eastward, but there is no passage between RenS and HornS ; the northern entrance is the easiest. The dangers in the northern entrance to Vest Vaagen appear to have been greatly exaggerated, and if a vessel is able to lay up South she might stand in without a pilot : Shoal ground extends from 2 to 3 cables, off the east side of VardS north and south of SvinS, a long low islet near the north end of the island ; and the east side of SvinS is shoal nearly one cable off shore. Tofteskjer, which lies about 2 cables from the east side of VardS, half a mile southward of SvinS, is marked by an iron pole. The east side of VardS is also shoal about one cable off shore, between the point south of Tofteskjer and the small bight northward of the fort, and a shoal runs nearly due north about 2 cables off the point on the east side of the entrance to the bay. * A small factory, with a slip or dock capable of accommodating vessels of large tonnage, is a great desideratum for this port ; and, judging by inquiries made on the spot, the cost of construction would be moderate. \u2014 Lieut. G. T. Temple, R.N."], [445, "427 CHAP, xvii.] VARDO \u2014 BUSSESUND. The only directions that seem necessary for the northern entrance to Vest Vaagen are that vessels should pass at least one cable eastward of Svino and Tofteskjer, or nearly 4 cables eastward of the northern part of VardS, and keep nearly in mid-channel when entering the bay. If working in or out, care must be taken not to stand to the eastward between RenS and RenS-skjer, as a shoal runs nearly 2 cables off the south-east side of the latter. The church, which stands on an eminence, is a conspicuous object from the north entrance. Entering Vest Vaagen from the south-eastward, keep within 3 cables of the east side of VardS until past HornSflue ; then haul over towards the south side of RenS, and run along it until the bay is open, in order to clear the shoal on the east side of the entrance. HornSflue, which is marked by an iron pillar, is about 3 cables long, east and west, and barely 2 cables broad ; the southern edge lies 3 cables from the south side of HornS. The position of the shoal will be shown by a short breaking sea if there is any swell outside, and by tide ripplings in fine weather. Ost Vaagen, the bay on the south side of VardS, runs in about 4 cables north and south, and decreases in breadth from about 2 cables at the entrance to less than one cable near the inner end. In the outer part of the bay there is anchorage near the western shore in 3 to 4 fathoms over sand ; but it is very much exposed to south-easterly winds, which throw in a heavy sea, and is not adapted to the larger class of sailing vessels. En tering Ost Vaagen, keep at least 3 cables southward of Steiln\u00e6s, the point on the west side of the entrance, until the bay is well open ; avoid the eastern shore, which runs off shoal to a considerable distance, and take care not to stand too far in, as the depth decreases to 9 and 6 feet about 1| cables northward of Steiln\u00e6s. BUSSE-S UND, between VardS and the mainland, has an average breadth of one mile, and affords good anchorage to vessels bound either way, though it is somewhat exposed to swell from the northward and southward. There are 10 to 14 fathoms in the middle of the sound, but the usual anchorage south-west of the fort has a depth of 8 to 4 fathoms, according to the distance from the island shore, over sand and small stones. There is also a small harbour between the south-west side of Tyveholm and Ostre Smelror. The space between the north side of Tyveholm, and the point north of Vestre Smelror is shallow and rocky ; Englsvikflue, a small rock abreast of the powder magazine on VardS, will be avoided by keeping in mid channel, or by giving the west point of VardS, south-eastward of Tyveholm, a berth of at least 2\\ cables ; it must be borne in mind that shoal o-round extends about 3 cables southward from the south-west end of VardS.

VARDO tO the WHITE SEA. \u2014 From 5 miles east of VardShus, vessels bound to the White Sea should steer E.S.E. easterly (S. 69\u00b0 E.) for 111 miles, which will lead on the meridian of Oleni island, and a farther distance of 100 miles on a S.E. by E. course will lead 18 miles north of Sviatoi Nos. CAUTION. \u2014 When sailing along the coast of Russian Lapland, great caution is necessary in consequence of the prevalence of fogs, during which it is unsafe to run, unless the position of the vessel is well known, on account of a decided indraught, which invariably sets on the shore. The flood stream runs 8 hours to the south-east, and the ebb 4 hours to the north-west ; this rule is however only applicable when close inshore, for in the offing the flood sets in more directly from the northward, and is in fact the indraught against which it is necessary to guard. VARDO TO JACOB RIVER. VARANGER FIORD.\u2014 At Kibergn\u00e6s, 41 miles S. A W. from the south-western extreme of VardS, the coast bends to the westward, and forms the northern shore of the estuary of Varanger fiord. Domenfjeld, between VardS and Kiberg, attains an elevation of 500 feet, and is the highest point for some miles round, the coast between Kiberg and VadsS, a distance of 31 miles, being generally low and flat, forming open shallow bays bounded by white sand hills. Being better protected against northerly gales than the east and north shores of the Varanger peninsula this coast is now thickly populated, and vegetation, though still scanty, is more vigorous. WEATHER. \u2014 The climate in Varanger fiord differs materially from that of the outer coast, consequently the wind often blows in contrary directions between Kibergn\u00e6s and VadsS. The sea wind generally reaches as far in as Lille EkkerS, 20 miles westward of Kiberg, and there meets the so-termed Varanger wind, which often blows out of Varanger fiord from the south-west or south, while there is a north-west wind, with foggy weather at VardS. In the entrance to Varanger fiord, between VardS and Ribachi peninsula, easterly winds are remarkably prevalent during the summer, and are so constant that they might almost be named trade winds. They continue till the autumn, when shifting winds and unsettled weather form a transition to a hard and stormy winter, during which the prevailing winds are south-westerly.* * At 5 p.m. on the 14th of July 1874, when becalmed about 15 miles westward of Ribachi peninsula, the yacht Annie was struck by a regular white squall from the N.W., which subsided to a strong breeze lasting 6 hours. This was followed by moderate north-easterly winds, with overcast rainy weather, which lasted 3 days. For some hours before the squall the air was hazy and very oppressive.

XVII.] From the middle of May to the beginning of July, when the ice breaks up in the White Sea, dense sea fogs often roll in as far as VadsS, but seldom reach the inner part of Varanger fiord. CURRENTS. \u2014 Southward of VardS, and especially on the coast between Kiberg and VadsS, very strong currents are experienced ; the principal set is to the eastward, but it changes at high and low water, and is probably dependent on the winds prevailing westward of the North Cape, as well as on the great ocean current that sweeps round the coast. In Varanger fiord, and along the contiguous Russian coast, there is also a strong but irregular current ; it creates a short and heavy sea, which often rises without any wind, when distant gales drive fogs and swell in towards the coast. SOUNDINGS- \u2014 Between VardS and VadsS, the depths near the land vary from 50 to upwards of 100 fathoms, increasing to the southward, and there is no off-lying shoal nearer than HenS-grund, 23 miles south ward of Kiberg. Kiberg. \u2014 The harbour at Kiberg, a fishing station much frequented by Russian coasters, is cousidered good by the inhabitants ; but it is open to all winds from the east and south, which must throw in a heavy sea, and there are several rocks in the entrance. Vessels may bring up on the east and west sides of the bight, and also between the two middle rocks ; the space between the rocks and the houses is shallow. The western anchorage has a depth of 3 to 8 fathoms over sand. KIBERG to SKALN\u00c6S. \u2014 For a distance of nearly 3 miles westward of Kiberg, low islets, and rocks above and below water extend from one to 1 Jj miles off shore, therefore it is prudent to give this part of the coast a berth of 2 miles. Entering Varanger fiord in thick weather it is necessary to keep a good look-out for the promontory of Skaln\u00e6s, or Gallonjarg,as its long, flat, projecting point might easily be mistaken for one of the Ekker islands, which lie farther to the south-west, and in that case a vessel intending to pass between Lille EkkerS and the mainland with a scant wind, might run aground in Skalvik, between Komagn\u00e6s and Skaln\u00e6s. There is no harbour or safe anchorage between Kiberg and Skaln\u00e6s, and the various points and bays run off flat and stony for a considerable distance. Store Ekkero. \u2014 Vessels meeting with contrary winds off Lille EkkerS might bring up in 3 to 5 fathoms on the west side of Store EkkerS, 7 miles south-westward of Skaln\u00e6s ; a heavy sea runs in during south easterly winds, and the holding ground is untrustworthy. The inner part of the bay is shallow, therefore care must be taken not to stand too far in. Both Store and Lille EkkerS are now inhabited, after having long been"], [448, "430 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. deserted. Store EkkerS consists of horizontal strata of sandstone, abruptly broken off to the eastward ; immense number of sea fowl breed on it, and their eggs form a valuable addition to the resources of the inhabitants. VADSO,* a town situated on the northern shore of Varanger fiord, 7 miles westward of Store EkkerS, was endowed with the privileges of a market town in 1833, and has now 1,850 inhabitants, of whom a large pro portion are Qu\u00e6ns. f It consists of neatly built wooden houses, with tolerably regular streets, and is divided into Ydre, Midtre, and Indre VadsS, the Norwegians occupying the middle or principal part, while the outer and inner, or east and west divisions, are inhabited by Qu\u00e6ns. The east end of the town is also named Kv\u00e6nbyen (the Qu\u00e6n town). The fisheries form the chief resource of VadsS, but it is also the station for Herr Svend Foyn's whaling expeditions in Varanger fiord, which he has conducted since 1864.J On Store VadsS or KirkeS, the island opposite the town, Herr Koyn has erected a steam factory for the preparation of train oil and guano, and in 1870 he sent 1,700 barrels of train oil and 700 bags of fish guano into the market as the produce of that season's fishing. \u00a7 The average number of whales killed every summer varies from 30 to 40, || and when the factory cannot keep pace with the supply of raw material, masses of putrescent flesh and offal lie floating or stranded about the harbour, creating an offensive smell. VadsS is the last place at which the Norwegian mail steamers call. * So named because the old town stood on the island of Vadso, or more properly Vando, where there was a fresh water spring, which has now disappeared. See plan of Vadso havn on Admiralty chart, No. 2317. \u25a0f The constant flow of Qu\u00e6ns into Norway has now almost assumed the proportions of a regular migration, and Vadso is especially the place where they have established themselves. f Before that time the \" sinner \" or \" rorqual \" was not considered worth the risk of pursuit, its blubber being thinner and of inferior quality, and its baleen much shorter and of less value than that of the \" right whale,\" while its amazing power and activity render it a far more dangerous object of attack. Herr Foyn's method, which cost him nearly 9,000/. before it was perfected, is to pursue the whales in a small screw steamer painted green, with a swivel gun weighing about 3 cwt. in the bow. From this is fired a compound projectile, consisting of a harpoon with hinged barbs like the arms of an anchor, and an explosive shell containing about one lb. of powder, the whole weighing 20 or 30 lb. The barbs lie snugly along the harpoon shaft till it has penetrated the flesh of the whale, bat when it is drawn backwards they open out at an angle of 45\u00b0, and prevent its withdrawal. The whale is often killed instantaneously by the bursting of the shell, and is towed into harbour by the nose. An important feature of the Vadso whale fishery is the economic utilisation of the whole animal ; instead of using the blubber and bone only, the remainder of the carcase or \" kreng,\" is converted into guano or portable manure. The value of 36 whales killed up to the 21st of Septem ber 1870 was 6,666/., exclusive of guano, the value of the average yield of each whale being 123/. in oil, and 62/. in whalebone. Two steam vessels were employed. \u00a7 Chr. TSnsherg. || Professor I. A.

Off the west end of the island there are 24 to 28 feet at mean low water, shoaling to 16 and 15 feet farther in. The bottom consists of loose sand, and the depth is continually diminishing. The ground rises to the eastward, and the east and west ends of the sound are only connected by a narrow channel, which during spring tides has about 10 feet in it at high water, and dries at low water. The anchorage off the east end of the town has a depth of 6 to 9 feet. Loading and unloading has to be performed by lighters, and is attended with difficulty, as the tidal streams run through the sound with great strength, and the shores run off shoal to a considerable distance. It is said that measures will probably be taken for the improvement of the harbour. As KirkeS is low, the town of VadsS is visible over it from Varanger fiord ; the church is very conspicuous. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at VadsS at 6 h. 30 m. During north-easterly gales, springs rise as much as 12 feet. The average rise is between 6 and 8 feet.* Shoals. \u2014 The only shoals off the entrance to VadsS harbour are two patches carrying 8 and 6 fathoms, which lie S.E. by E. \\ E. distant three quarters and 1^ miles from the east end of KirkeS ; the south-eastern shoal sometimes breaks in bad weather. VADSO tO NYBORG.\u2014 From between VadsS and BugS, the inner part of Varanger fiord, with its two small branches or continuations, M\u00e6sk fiord and Karl or Karel-bunden, extends about 25 miles inland, and gradually decreases in breadth from 6 miles at the entrance to 2 miles between N\u00e6sseby and Kvaln\u00e6s. The northern shore trends about W. by N. from VadsS to Nyborg (at the inner end of M\u00e6sk fiord), and is higher and less flat and uniform than the coast to the eastward, the loftiest hills being Klubben\u00e6s and Storfjeld. Vegetation also becomes more vigorous towards the inner part of the fiord ; at Paddeby, 7 miles westward of VadsS, a few scattered birch trees appear, and at Klubben\u00e6s, only 5 miles farther in, the hills are clothed with verdure and a luxuriant growth of birch, to the very summits. From hence the coast is well populated. The prevailing for mation is sandstone. Nordre JakobS and Skidten Rivers.\u2014 Between Vadso and Paddeby the shore runs off flat to a considerable distance, and should be given a good berth. The Nordre Jakobs, or North Jacob river, a stream said to abound in fish, disembogues at Finsn\u00e6s, 2 miles west of Paddeby, and three-quarters of a mile farther west is the mouth of Skidten river. Anchorage may be found at both these places in 3 to 4 fathoms over clay. From \" Den Norske Lods, Vol. VIII, 1870."], [450, "432 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. A rock lies in the middle of the entrance to North Jacob river, but vessels of light draught might pass over it at high water, and there is a deep secure basin within. MortensnSBS. \u2014 The bay at Mortensn\u00e6s, a trading station on the west side of Storfjeld, 7 miles from Finsn\u00e6s, would afford anchorage to vessels of any draught, but it is exposed to a heavy sea during southerly winds, and there are several rocks west of the point. Between the south-eastern rock and the point there are 10 to 12 fathoms, but towards the northern shore of the bay, and in the small cove near the houses, there are only 3 fathoms ; the bottom consists of clay.* NsBSSeby. \u2014 The small bay east of N\u00e6sseby church, 3| miles west of Mortensn\u00e6s, has a depth of 3 fathoms over clay, but is open to the south ward. M\u00e6sk fiord is the northern and innermost branch of Varanger fiord, with which it is connected by a very narrow passage named M\u00e6skfiord strSmmen, 2\\ miles from N\u00e6sseby church. At the inner end of the fiord, on the north side, is the trading station of Nyborg or Raavikjok, whence Varanger-fjeld may be crossed to Seida. For a distance of nearly 2 miles westward of N\u00e6sseby, shallow stony ground runs 3 or 4 cables off shore, and as there are shoals on both sides of M\u00e6skfiord-strSmmen, the services of a pilot are indispensable. Shoal ground also extends from 2 to 4 cables off the south and west shores of M\u00e6skfiord. About three-quarters of a mile eastward of Nyborg is a rocky shoal which covers at high water, and between that and the land to the northward is a good summer anchorage, with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms over soft mud. In winter the fiord is frozen as far out as M\u00e6skfiord-strSmmen. Temporary anchorages. \u2014 Besides the harbours and anchorages already mentioned, there are several other places, between Kiberg and N\u00e6sseby, where Russian vessels are iu the habit of anchoring ; they cannot, however, be termed harbours, and frequent disasters have proved their insecurity. Amongst these places may be named Kramvig, west of Kiberg ; Komagelv, Skalelv and Skalvig, northward of Skaln\u00e6s ; Nordvaag at Store EkkerS; Lille VadsS, Andersby, and Sandskjer, between VadsS and Paddeby ; and other spots, where, although it is possible to find fair holding ground, it is unadvisable to anchor. KvalllSDS. \u2014 At Kvaln\u00e6s, an important fishing station on the south side of Karl-bunden, there is anchorage opposite the houses in 3 fathoms.

S YD- VARANGER.\u2014 The whole of the southern shore of Varange fiord is commonly termed Syd or South Varanger, although the western part actually belongs to the parish of N\u00e6sseby, which is included in the Tana district. The coast, which trends nearly E.S.E. 45 miles from Kvaln\u00e6s to Jacob river, is intersected by several deep inlets, and the cliffs, though neither lofty or imposing in form, are yet steep, bold, and rocky, presenting a striking contrast to the flat-topped sloping terraces on the north side of the fiord ; the absence of outlying islands and rocks is in fact the only feature common to both coasts. The general character of the country also differs materially from that of the Varanger peninsula, and the forest growth is especially remarkable for so high a latitude ; even near the coast, the bare rocky hills are relieved by birch, scrub, and heather, while within the fiords the trees rapidly increase in size and number, until at no great distance from the sea the hills are covered with birch, aspen, and alder, with luxuriant grasses and heather. About 15 miles farther inland, the birch begins to disappear, and is gradually lost in the dense forests of fir, the area of which, in Syd- Varanger alone, may be estimated at not less than 800 geographical square miles.* The surface of the country is hilly and undulating, the thickly wooded slopes being interspersed by numerous lakes and tarns. The principal rivers are the Neiden, Pasvig (Kloster), and Jacob. Granite appears to be the prevailing rock on the coast. In winter the fiords of Syd-Varanger generally freeze to a distance of 3 to 7 miles from the inner end. During the iast 30 years the population of Syd-Varanger has greatly increased owing to the improved means of communication and other con ditions favourable to colonisation, and the parish has now two churches, j Kvaln\u00e6s to BugO. \u2014 From Kvaln\u00e6s to BugS, a distance of 19 miles, the coast is desolate, barren, and generally more mountainous than that to the eastward ; it is free from dangers, with the exception of a few scattered rocks lying within 2 or 3 cables of the shore, but affords no anchorage. BugO. \u2014 The first harbour in Syd-Varanger, eastward of Vein\u00e6sbunden, is between the mainland and BugS, a low island lying S. by W. 6 miles from the town of VadsS. It may be entered either from the northward or eastward, but the northern entrance is narrowed' by rocks off the west side of BugS, and is also rather shallow ; the eastern entrance is deep and clear. Vessels may bring up either opposite the houses, or off the south- * \" Indberetning om Skovforholdene i Finmarken.\" \u2014 Forstmester Barth. t Wolves have lately been troublesome in Syd-Varanger ; it is supposed that they are attracted to the coast by the \" krengs \" that drift ashore from the whaling establishment at Vadso.

The depth decreases to 15 or 16 feet towards the shore, and as a swell runs in during easterly winds the latter anchorage is indifferent. BugO fiord. \u2014 Eastward of BugS is the entrance to Bugo fiord, which runs 8 miles inland between BugS fjeld and Bras fjeld. At the inner end of the fiord is a Quain settlement. Bras Havn, on the east side of the point between BugS and KjS fiords, is a small land-locked harbour with a depth of 6 fathoms over sand ; the proper entrance is southward of the islet forming the harbour, as the passage on the north side is only 40 to 60 feet broad, and the depth in it at mean high water s not more than 6 to 8 feet. When entering the harbour, vessels should pass well to the westward of a shoal carrying 2\\ fathoms, which lies half a mile N.W. from the north point of KjS. Kj6 fiord. \u2014 Between Bras havn and SkogerS (a large island 1,600 feet high), is the entrance to KjS fiord, which extends 14 miles inland, and is connected with BSg fiord by Kors fiord ; the inner part, into which the Neiden and Munk rivers disembogue, is named Neiden fiord. The shores of this inlet are high, rocky, and barren for some distance inland, but assume a milder character towards Neiden fiord, where there are several Quain settlements. The banks of the Neiden and Munk rivers consist of huge sand hills. There is a loomery in the outer part of the fiord. * KjS fiord is free from dangers with the exception of Hal var skjer, which lies close to the mainland 1\\ miles south of Bras-havn ; but about 2 miles within the entrance is a narrow strait and rapid named StrSmmen, which sailing vessels can only pass through with a commanding breeze if the tide is adverse. Immediately south of StrSmmen there is good anchorage in Stensn\u00e6svaag, on the west side of the fiord ; and at Buholm, on the south side of the entrance to Kors fiord, there is anchorage in 15 fathoms over clay. Off the mouth of the Neiden, about 2 miles from the head of the fiord, are extensive sand banks, which dry at low water, and as banks have also been thrown up by the Munk river, the inner part of the fiord will only admit vessels of very light draught. KORS FIORD. \u2014 Eastward of Buholm there is anchorage in Kors fiord at Junkerelv, in 5 fathoms over clay ; vessels may also bring up in almost all the coves and bights on both sides of the fiord, and wherever the land is not very high or steep. It is advisable to keep on the north side of the fiord when passing Tusundvig, as a shoal is said to run some distance off the southern shore. Ellinghavn, at the east end of the fiord on the south side, has a depth of 5 fathoms over sand. BOG FIORD. \u2014 Eastward of Sk0 rS is the entrance to BSg fiord, which, with its continuations, Kloster-elv and Lang fiords, is the"], [453, "435 CHAP. XVII.] BUGO FIORD \u2014 RENO ROAD. largest and most important of the fiords of Syd-Varanger. It \u2022 extends 12 miles inland to the mouth of the Pasvig river, and 17 miles to the inner end of Lang fiord. The hills are of inconsiderable altitude on both sides of the fiord. Vegetation consists chiefly of birch and luxuriant grasses. On Kirkn\u00e6s, or as it is also termed Piseln\u00e6s, between the Kloster elv and Lang fiords is the church and parsonage of Syd-Varanger, as well as a trading station where the ordinary articles of ship chandlery may be obtained in moderate quantities.* Entering BSg fiord, vessels may pass on either side of Kj\u00e6lmesS, which lies between SkogerS and Holmengraa-fjeld, but the eastern passage is the best and most spacious. East Dragene, the rocks off the north-east point of Kj\u00e6lmesS, should be given a good berth. The stream produced by the freshes from the Pasvig river almost always runs out through BSg fiord. and early in summer, when the river is high, it is almost impossible to navigate the fiord under sail without a strong breeze, j Kj\u00e6lmeSO. \u2014 There are several small harbours on the west and south sides of Kj\u00e6lmesS, that near the north-west end of the island being the best ; it has a depth of 3 fathoms over fine sand, but is very narrow. Entering from Varanger fiord, keep rather over towards SkogerS until past West Dragene rocks, which extend about three-quarters of a mile in a N.N.W. direction from the north-west point of Kj\u00e6lmesS ; proceed along the west side of the latter island, passing at least one cable west of a little sandy cove, and keep a good look out for the entrance to the harbour, which cannot be seen until the vessel is close to it. The point forming the harbour is steep-to. The coves on the south-west and south sides of Kj\u00e6lmesS are only suitable for very small coasters. Sdlvfarbugt. \u2014 Within the eastern point on the north side of SSlvfarbugt, the inlet on the east side of SkogerS, is a good harbour pro tected from all winds, and although it is frozen in winter, vessels might safely lay up there. The entrance which opens directly the point is passed, is through a sound IA cables long, north and south, and half a cable broad in the narrowest part. The harbour extends 2 cables N.W. by W. from the north end of the sound, and is IA cables broad. The least depth in the sound is 18 feet, but in the harbour there are 18 to 19 fathoms, decreasing regularly to 4 fathoms near the shore ; the bottom consists of clay. Reno road, on the south side of RenS, would afford good anchorage to vessels of any draught. On the south side, and in the middle of the bay, there are 30 to 33 fathoms, the depths decreasing to the north, east, * In 1867 Bog fiord was frozen as far out as Kj\u00e6lmesS, and even on the 25th of June the ice lay about three miles out from the head ofthe fiord. \u2014 Professor J.

The best anchorage is along the south side of Reno in 15 to 20 fathoms, shoaling to 4 fathoms within ' a ship's length of the island shore. The bank, which consists of clay, is steep to the westward. Vessels may also anchor at the south end of the narrow sound between RenS and the mainland. When entering RenS road from the westward, care should be taken to avoid a steep bank of stones and clay, which lies a little south of mid channel ; it carries 9 feet, has an extent of 6 to 8 fathoms, and may be passed on either side ; from it to the south-west point of RenS bears N.W. a little northerly, and the western extreme of H\u00e6len bears S.W. Both the flood and ebb streams run to the eastward along the south side of RenS, but on the south side of the anchorage, between H\u00e6len and Ropelv, the flood runs to the westward. Kloster-elv fiord. \u2014 Anchorage may be found at several places on both sides of Kloster-elv fiord (named Pasvik fiord by the Russians), and vessels-of-war may anchor in 15 fathoms off the east end of Skogholm, a low island east of Kirken\u00e6s. A shoal lies between 2 and 3 cables from the eastern shore of the fiord between H\u00e6len and Skogholm. Lang fiord extends 3 miles in a south-westerly direction from Kirken\u00e6s, and then bending abruptly to the S.S.E. runs 5 miles farther inland ; the outer and inner parts are connected by a narrow tidal rapid, the passage of which is attended with danger, even for boats, as it is obstructed by large boulders. The entrance to the inner part of Kloster-elv fiord is eastward of Skog holm, the narrow sound on the west side of that island being partially dry at low water. A shoal, on which strangers are almost certain to run, lies right in the fairway southward of the east point of Skogholm, and as it has not yet been charted correctly, and local knowledge is required to dis tinguish the clearing marks, vessels bound to Pasvik river without a pilot should bring up a little northward of the point in about 15 fathoms, and send a boat to Elven\u00e6s for assistance. Elven\u00e6S. \u2014 In the cove at Elven\u00e6s, the point on the east side of the mouth of Pasvik river, there is good anchorage for yachts or coasters in 5 to 7 fathoms ; the best berth is right opposite the house of Herr Klerk, the Lensmand of Syd-Varanger ; but the anchor should not be dropped too far in, as the east and south shores of the cove are flat, and dry out a short distance at low water. The stream from the river is thrown to the westward of the anchorage by the point. Pasvig river. \u2014 The Pasvig,* which is also termed the Kloster, because the salmon fishery formerly belonged to the Peisen \" kloster \" or monastery, rises in lake Enare, and for a distance of about 60 miles, or * Patsjokka in Lappish."], [455, "chap, xvii.] 437 KLOSTER-ELV FIORD \u2014 PASVIG. very nearly its whole length, forms the boundary between Norway and Russia. The boundary was drawn across the river at Boris-Gleb, a little below the first fos, in order to include a small wooden chapel,* and a few Greek Catholic Lappsf ; by this means Russia obtained the best place in the river for salmon fishery, and about 100 acres of land on the Nor wegian bank. A noticeable feature of the Pasvig is that it forms a chain of narrow lakes, which are connected by reaches of river that seldom exceed one mile in length, and generally consist of rapids. It is said that there are about 12 lakes, and 29 fosses or falls on this river ; the first fos, beyond which salmon cannot run up, is less than 2 miles from Elven\u00e6s. The whole length ofthe Pasvig is navigable by means of \"stagning;\" but no vessels can ascend above Elven\u00e6s. The country bordering on the Pasvig is well suited to settlers ; there are extensive pine forests interspersed with patches of birch, of sufficient size for building purposes, and the river offers an easy means of transport for timber ; the soil is in places rich and fertile, and naturally produces good pasturage, while the river abounds iu fish and its banks in game. Shoals Off Holmengraa-fj eld. \u2014 NordkapstSten, a rock with only 7 feet over it, lies about 4 cables from the north side of Holmengraa fjeld, and the north-east side is shoal from 2 to 3 cables off shore between NordkapstSten and Holmengraa fiord. East Dragene rocks, kept well shut in to the southward of the north-west point of Kj\u00e6lmesS, will lead north ward of NordkapstSten. Jar fiord is a narrow inlet extending 11 miles inland on the east side of Holmengraa-fj eld ; the inner part is inhabited. Anchorage may be found at HindS or Tsogam, and in the inner part of the fiord ; vessels might also bring up for tide at several places near the shore. Rocks extend about three-quarters of a mile off shore on the east side of the entrance, but they are easily avoided by keeping over towards Holmengraa-fjeld. PASVIG, a fishing and trading station 3 J miles eastward of Jar fiord, is the eastern harbour of any importance on Norwegian territory. The point on the east side of the entrance is distinguished by a large stone beacon, which however is masked from the eastward, therefore vessels approaching from that direction should endeavour to make Skibsholm, and steer so as to pass at least 3 cables northward of it. There is no passage to the south-west of the rocks in the entrance to the harbour, but the channel between these and the point, though very narrow, will admit * A new chapel, also built of wood, was consecrated here on the 6th of September 1874. f Commonly termed \" Sholte \" Lapps, from a scrofulous affection of the head, which was formerly prevalent among them and deprived them of hair ; it has been almost eradicated by the efforts of Norwegian medical men."], [456, "438 THE NORTH CAPE TO JACOB RIVER. [chap. xvii. vessels of any draught. Vessels of large tonnage should anchor on the south-west side of the bay in 20 to 24 fathoms. Small vessels may run in towards a low point, and bring up in the bight between that and the steep shore to the southward. There are 15 fathoms right opposite a slope of broken rocks and stones, and 7 to 8 fathoms farther in towards the sands, about three-quarters of cable from which is a ballast heap with only 1 1 feet over it. A reef, with 7 fathoms water, stretches across the entrance to Pasvig, and forms a natural breakwater, so that although the harbour is open to the westward very little sea runs in. Smaastrom fiord is a fishing station 2 miles eastward of Pasvig. The entrance, which is narrowed by low rocks, should not be attempted without a j)ilot, until some local knowledge has been acquired. In the outer port of the fiord the depths vary from 4 to 7 fathoms. Kobholm fiord, between SmaastrSm fiord and Jacob river, is uninhabited, and has no good harbour, the depths being very irregular, and the wind baffling and squally off the surrounding hills. Small vessels may bring up in about 6 fathoms, close to the north shore of the bay on the west side of the fiord, but it is advisable to moor with a shore hawser, as the bank is very steep to the southward. There is also anchorage off the mouth of the stream at the inner end of the fiord. Strangers are recommended to pass westward of the small islets in the middle of Kob holm fiord, as rocks and shoals extend nearly half a mile off shore to the westward of Jacob river. JACOB RIVER, Jacobs-elv, or Vuorjem, disembogues half a mile eastward of Kobholm fiord, and forms the northern termination of the boundary between Norway and Russia. There are a few Norwegian houses on the left bank of the river, and two Russian families five on the opposite side, where there are also several fishing huts and salting houses. Russian fishing vessels from Kola lie in the mouth of the river during summer, but there are only 5 to 7 feet in the entrance, and it is also ob structed by alluvial banks of considerable extent, on which the sea breaks with the least swell from the northward.* A stone chapel, named after His Majesty King Oscar II., who attended divine service there on the 4th of July 1873, stands on the west side of the entrance to the river, not far from the three hundred and sixty-third and northern of the cairns that define the boundary between Norway, Russia, Finland, and Sweden, and thus marks the north-eastern limit of the kingdom of Norway. * The Norwegian gunboats Lougen and Gunhild found anchorage off the mouth of the river on the 4th of July 1873."], [457, "439 INDEX.
