III. Childe Harold was he hight : \u2014 but whence bis name And lineage long, it suits me not to say; Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame, And had been glorious in another day : But one sad losel soils a name for aye, However mighty in the olden time ; Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay, Nor florid prose, nor honied lies of rhyme Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.

But long ere scarce a third of his passed by, Worse than adversity the Childe befell ; He felt the fulness of satiety : Then loathed he in his native land to dwell, Which seemed to him more lone than Eremite's sad cell.

XII. The sails were silled, and fair the light winds blew, As glad to waft him from his native home ; And fast the white rocks faded from his view, And soon were lost in circumambient foam : And then, it may be, of his wish to roam Repented be, but in his bosom slept The silent thought, nor from his lips did come One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept, And to tbe reckless gales unmanly moaning kept."], [32, "26 CHILDE HAROLD'S CANTO I, XIII. But when the sun was sinking in the sea He seized his harp, which he at times could string, And strike, albeit with untaught melody, When deemed he no strange ear was listening : And now his singers o'er it he did fling, And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight.
