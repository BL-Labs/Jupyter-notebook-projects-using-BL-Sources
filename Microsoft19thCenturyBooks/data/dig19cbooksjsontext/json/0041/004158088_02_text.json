Lanwhitton, vulgo Lawhitton, is in the hundred of East ; and hath to the west South Pederwin, to the north Laun ceston, to the east the river Tamar, to the south Lezant. As for the name, I take Whitton to be the same as Whidden, white or fair ; so as to signify the white or fair church, from the beauty of its first building. It is a rectory valued in the King's books at 19/. 6s. 8d. The Bishop of Exeter is the patron. All this parish doth in a manner entirely belong to the Bishop of Exeter's great manor of Lanwhitton, I shall begin therewith : Mr. Camden tells you that this was one of the three manors given by Edward the elder about the year 905 to the Bishop of Kirton, from whom, on the union of the sees, it came to the Bishop of Exeter, in whose hands it hath ever since continued. By an extract from the Register of John de Grandison, Bishop of Exeter, from 1327 to 1369, it appears that at vol. in. b"], [14, "2 LANWHITTON, OR LAWHITTON. an Assizes held at Launceston, before John de Berwick, Walter de Burveton, Henry Spigurnel, John Ralph, and Henry de Stainton, Justices Itinerant, Thomas Bishop of Exeter was summoned to answer to our Lord the King by what authority he held the different royalties in the manors of Lanwhitton, St. Germans, and Poulton, and certain other privileges in Tregear and Penryn, with a free market, fairs, &c. ; and free warren over all lands belonging to the see throughout Cornwall. And the said Bishop, by his attorney, comes into court and saith, That as to the free market and fairs, and free warren, that the Lord Henry, father to our Lord the King that now is, did grant to one William, lately Bishop of Exeter, his predecessor, the said liberties to him and his successors for ever ; and pro duced the said King's charter for the same. And in respect to the liberties, he saith, that himself and his predecessors have held them from time of which there is no memory, without interruption, and therefore claims their continuance. The jurors agree that the said Bishop and his pre decessors had the said liberties, &c. in his manor of Pen ryn; but as for the manor of Tregear, that he and his predecessors had the same liberties from his and their villains, and not from their free tenants, a tempore quo non extat memoria, sine intermissione. The Bishops of Exeter have been accustomed to farm out their manor on lives to several gentlemen. The pre sent farmers are \u2014 Francis Manaton, Esq., William Clow berry, Esq., and Edward Bennet, of Hexworthy, Esq. I now costie to treat of the remarkable places of the said manor ; and first of the barton Hexworthy. Hexworthy \u2014 the field of reeds, corrupted, by pronuncia tion, from hesk or hesken, a reed or bulrush, and the Saxon worthing, a field. This place has been for three or four descents the seat of the family of Bennet. The present possessor, Edward Bennet, Esq., has been twice married ; first, to a daughter of Sir Walter Moyle, of"], [15, "3 LANWHITTON, OR LAWHITTON.

This was lately the seat, by copy of court roll under the farmers of this manor, of John Coren, Esq., who in the reign of Queen Anne was in the Commission of the Peace, and Deputy-Surveyor of the Duchy of Cornwall, who dying without issue, left his estate to his widow ; and on her de cease it fell to the three gentlemen above-named, lessees of the manor. Mr. Coren derived himself from the Co rens of St. Stephen's, in Branwrell, and gave for his arms, Arg. a millrind between two martlets in sess Sab. He left a part of his estate to a younger brother, now (November 1735) a captain of foot. THE EDITOR. The church of this parish, although gone much into decay, is said to exhibit appearances of venerable antiquity In it is a monument to the memory of Richard Bennet, counsellor at law, who died in 1619. And another of ar tificial stone, with the following inscription : \u2014 Underneath lieth the body of Richard Coffin, Esq. and also some of his nearest and dearest relations, who resided for many generations at Hexworthy, in this county. He was the son of Edward Bennet and Honor his wife, daughter of Richard Coffin, of Portledge iQ Devon, Esq. and Honor his wife, who was daughter of Edmund Prideaux, of Padstow, Esq. in this county. Dying without issue, in him ended the lineal descent of tbe families of Bennet and Coffin. He was born in the year 1715, and died Sept. 30, 1796*. This gentleman gave Hexworthy to one of his relations, the Prideauxes of Padstow. The lessees of the great manor having neglected to renew their holding, it reverted to Doctor George Lavington, B 2"], [16, "4 LANWHITTON, OR I.AWHITTON. Bishop of Exeter fom 1746 to 1762, who made anew lease in favour of his only child, afterwards married to the Rev. Nutcombe Nutcombe, Chancellor of the Cathedral, in whose three daughters or their families it still remains. The Editor cannot quit this parish without noticing that here resided as rector during many years the Rev. Robert Walker, who once entertained thoughts of really executing, what is now feebly attempted, a parochial history of Cornwall. The Editor well remembers waiting on him in 1787, to make inquiries respecting some of his own ancestors, when Mr. Walker, then far advanced in life, received him with the utmost kindness, insisted on his taking refreshments, and when they were declined on the ground of giving him trouble, Mr. Walker remarked, that such trouble was at once a duty and a pleasure, since out most important business in this world was to accommodate each other, and to make each other happy. In a letter from him dated November the 9th, of the same year, the parish is written Lewhitton. Mr. Walker is said to have been born in 1699. Lawhitton measures 2455 statute acres.

Where argillaceous earth, either alone or in conjunction with carbonate of lime, prevails in these rocks, the soil produced from them is very fertile ; but sometimes silica is so predominant, that the ground is comparatively barren."], [17, "5 LELANT. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Lelant is in the hundred of Penwith, and hath to the west Towednack, to the north St. Ives, to the east the river Hayle and St. Ives Bay, to the south St. Earth and Ludgvan. I take Lelant to be compounded of Le, a place, and Lan, a church, so as to signify the church place. It is dedicated to St. Uny, and therefore hath the adjunct of Uny Lelant mostly used in writings. But Leland calls it Lannant ; and if that be the right name, it is a church in a valley. In the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas, Lanvanta or Laventa is rated at 15/. 13s. id. It is a vicarage valued in the King's book together with \u25a0St. Ives and Tewednack, which pass in the same presenta tion, at 22/. Ils. lOd. The patronage in the Bishop of Exeter. The sheaf and tithe of fish in Lord Hobart, as heir to Sir John Maynard, who got possession of them from Edward Noseworthy, Esq. St. Uny, to whom not only this church, but .ilso that of Redruth, and a ruined chapel in St. Wendrone, are de dicated, is by Leland called St. Unine. THE EDITOR. The church of this parish is situated in the midst of sand, at the very extreme point inclosed by the sea, and by the estuary of Hayle. It is said to have been almost entirely covered towards the early part of the last century by one of these immense drifts of shell-sand which occa sionally overwhelm this coast, originating, as is supposed,"], [18, "6 LELANT. from the Nympha Bank, lying about midway between the Land's End and Cape St. Clear. The Editor has in his possession the following receipt for money contributed by his collateral ancestor towards clearing the church, and accommodating it for the celebration of divine service ; which was then done, and the old church restored \u2014 not a new one constructed, as some writers on Cornwall have erroneously stated. August 11th, 1738. Mr. Hugh Powley and Mr. John Pears received of Mr. Henry Davies for bounty money towards Lelant church, twenty-six pounds five shillings, as appears by the church book. Thomas Kniveton. Several great inundations of sand appear to have covered this coast at distant and uncertain periods; but the com minuted shells are perpetually increasing on the sea shore, from whence they are drifted over the adjacent lands : their progress has, however, been checked, and in some places almost arrested, by the simple expedient of planting the Arundo Arenaria of Linn\u00e6us, named by others, Calamagrestis Arenaria. This rush grows readily in the sand, where it mechanically opposes all motion on the surface, and ultimately favours the production of a grassy turf. Tradition asserts, that a town of some magnitude, having a market, and the establishment of a custom-house, stood near the church, when Hayle afforded deep water with out the aid of artificial works, and before St. Ives had risen into consequence. Foundations of houses have un doubtedly been discovered here under the sand ; and the tradition is somewhat confirmed by a distinction paid to the principal village, which is universally called Lelant Town, and not Church Town, as in other parishes. The town is divided into two separate portions, usually distinguished as higher or lower, but the latter was for merly called Tredreath, the town on the sand or beach."], [19, "LELANT. 7 This parish has several other villages : Brunion, Trecrob ben, giving name to the most picturesque granite hill in that whole district, Polpear, Trink, &c. In the taxation of Pope Nicholas, Lelant, under the name of Lanvanta or Laventa, is rated at 15/. 13s. id. without any notice of St. Ives or Towednack. Lelant, as the mother church, is alone of the three parishes provided with a glebe; but this land, although more extensive than what falls, on an average, to neigh bouring incumbents, is rendered of very little value, and totally unfitted for a residence, by the encroachment of sand. An ancient vicarage house is believed to have dis appeared with the town at the last great inundation, and the parish has remained longer than the period of memory, without a resident clergyman; but in this very year (1835) the Reverend Uriah Tonkin having been most liberally accommodated with an elevated situation at some distance from the sea, by Mr. Praed, is now constructing a house adequate to every thing that can be wished. The rectorial tithes are said by Mr. Lysons to have been given by Robert de Cardinham, in the reign of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, to the monastery of Tywardreath ; but that afterwards they were appropriated to the College of Cre- diton. Although this college has in part survived the general devastation of King Henry the Eighth, yet the tithes of Lelant were Liken from it, and after passing through various hands, they now belong to Mr. Praed. Mr. Lysons also states, but without giving any authority, that St. Uny (a brother of St. Herygh), patron of Lelant, Crowan, and Redruth, was buried in this church. If St. Uny and St. Herygh ever existed at all, they were probably two of the missionaries from Ireland. The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to Candlemas day, but supposed to be in commemoration of the Saint. Trembetha is said to have been the seat of John Hals, one of the judges in the reign of King Henry the Fifth,"], [20, "8 LELANT. and to have been sold by him to the Godolphins. In the time of Queen Elizabeth it belonged to the Mahons. The barton and manor are now the joint property of Mr. Praed and Mr. Champernowne, of Dartington, near Tot nes, as to two-thirds ; and the remaining share is divided between Mr. Tremayne, Mr. Rodd, and Mrs. Stephens, as coheirs of the family of H earle. Lelant was for centuries the residence of three old and respectable families\u2014 Praed, Hoskin, and Pawley. The Hoskins still remain possessed of their ancient freehold, and other property ; and Mr. Henry Hoskins, the present head of the family, resides in a house at the northern ex tremity of Tredreath, or Lower Lelant Town, bearing all the marks which distinguished the dwellings of private gentlemen in the times of the Tudors or Plantagenets. The Pawleys are extinct, having declined through a series of years; Goonwhyn, or Gunwin, (the White Croft) where the family had long resided, together with some other remnants of property, came to Miss Jane Pawley, sufficient, however, to give her the reputation of an heiress : but misfortunes and disgraceful conduct reduced her so very low, that the Editor recollects her soliciting charity from those who once looked up to her superior station ; and this representative of an ancient family closed her mortal career in a parish workhouse. The Praeds are also extinct ; but the name has, with singular felicity, arrived at tenfold splendour in a new dynasty. The original family became at last represented by two brothers : the elder distinguished as Colonel Praed, married a Basset cf Tehidy, but died soon after, leaving all the personal property to his widow : the younger brother suc ceeded to the real estate ; but having been unsuccessfully engaged in trade, and finding the farms mostly leased on lives with the payment of small quitrents, according to the custom of those times, he became more and more embarrassed; till, meeting with a gentleman of the family"], [21, "9 LELANT. of Mackworth, in Glamorganshire, bred to the higher department of the law, he arranged with this gentleman, that on being freed from all pecuniary difficulties, and receiving a certain annuity for life, the whole Cornish estate should be transferred to Mr. Mackworth ; on the further conditions of his taking the name of Praed, and what seems almost ludicrous, of his engaging, so far as the consent of one party could be sufficient, to marry Miss Penrose, of Penrose, near Helston, the heiress-at-law to Mr. Praed's estate. Mr. Praed died about the years 1716 or 1717, when Mr. Mackworth came into possession, having performed every engagement to the utmost of his power ; for the Editor recollects having heard from his son, the late Mr. Humphrey Mackworth Praed, that his father went to Penrose in execution of the condition dependent on another ; but that, so far from obtaining success, he found some difficulty in escaping with his life. The validity of the transfer was ultimately disputed on the part of Miss Penrose ; and Mr. Humphrey Mackworth Praed has told the Editor that he was present at the trial in his nurse's arms, when the agreement was finally esta blished. The lady married a gentleman of the name of Pearse, and left an only daughter, who married Mr. dim ming; and their great-grandson, Sir Alexander Cumming Gordon, of Elginshire, is the present representative of the former family of Trevethow. Mr. Mackworth Praed settled at Trevethow, where he was succeeded by his eldest son, Mr. Humphrey Mack worth Praed, one of the most distinguished men in his adopted country, for abilities, acquirements, wit, know ledge of the world, kindness, and unbounded hospitality. He once represented the county in Parliament, and on another occasion the borough of St. Ives. He married a lady of the eminent family of Forrester, in Shropshire, widow of Sir Bryant Broughton Delves, and had six chil dren : William, his eldest son and heir ; Herbert, Rector of"], [22, "10 LELANT. Ludgvan, who died in early life; and four daughters- Catherine, Mary, Arabella, and Julia. Mary married the Reverend William .Sandys, Vicar of St. Minver, and died without leaving any family. The other three never married. Mr. William Praed married Miss Backwell, of Tyring ham, in Buckinghamshire, eventually sole heiress to her very opulent family. He represented St. Ives in several Parliaments, and Banbury in one. Endowed with a strong mind and with an active dispo sition, Mr. Praed did not confine his public services to the discharge of duties in the House of Commons. To him the nation is mainly indebted for one of the most useful and most successful of our public works \u2014 The Grand Junction Canal. Three extensive chalk ridges issue from the great cen tral nucleus forming Salisbury Plain; the most southern terminates at Beachy-head, constituting what is called the South Downs. The middle range, passing through Hamp shire, Surrey, and Kent, extends to Dover, inclosing between them the wealds of Kent and Sussex, with the Hastings sand formation, and the great alluvial deposits of Romney and Pevensey Marshes. The northern range is still more extensive than the other two: this, passing through Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, traverses Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire; then, after being cut through by the Wash, re-appears in Yorkshire, and finally terminates its long course at Flamborough Head. These two latter ranges intercept all water communication between the capital and the interior of England, except by the Thames, which finds its way through the northern ridge of chalk above Reading. Most river navigations beyond the reach of tides, are impeded by shallows in summer, by floods in winter, by artificial rights of mills, drainages, &c, all of which are avoided by the Grand Junction Canal, which, availing itself of cross valleys, and perforating narrow ridges, has opened an inland navigation from the metro-"], [23, "11 LELANT. polis to the British Channel, to the Irish Sea, and to the German Ocean. Mr. William Praed closed his useful and honourable career of life at Trevethow, in Oct. 1833, having com pleted his eighty-fourth year; and is succeeded by his eldest son, Mr. James Praed, recently elected member for Buckinghamshire, the county in which he principally resides. Mr. Praed married Miss Chaplin, of Lincolnshire, and has several children. If this distinguished family should now unfortunately be lost to Cornwall, it is curious to remark that, after remaining there much above a century, no permanent connexion has been formed, and not a single relative will be left behind. Trevethow is by its natural situation one of the finest places in the west of Cornwall. The house looks to the estuary of Hayle, over a park variegated by rising ground and vales ; and immediately behind the house stands Tre crobben or Trencroben-hill, crowned by tin ancient for tress, corresponding with those described by Dr. Barham in the third volume of the Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall ; this hill is the last towards the killas formation of a granite district, extending from the Land's End, and covered with rocks of a magnitude to create strong impressions of grandeur. The house was so much enlarged and decorated by Mr. Humphrey Mack worth Praed, as almost to claim him for its founder; and it is sheltered by trees more numerous and of a larger size than can usually be found in a country unfavourable to their growth. But the great artificial ornament of this place is its exten sive plantations. Mr. Humphrey Mackworth Praed dis played on this comparatively trifling subject, the same acumen which distinguished him in matters of importance, throughout a long life. Having observed a single pinaster fir, the Pinus Pinaster of Linn\u00e6us, growing in an exposed situation, and braving the violence of our west wind, Mr."], [24, "12 LELANT. Praed immediately conjectured that this tree might be rendered available not merely for ornament, but as affording a shelter for better trees ; the experiment was immediately tried, and with complete success. The pinaster loses all its beauty when it gets beyond the dimensions of a shrub : its wood in this climate is almost useless, and no tree ceases to live after so short a period ; but it grows rapidly at first in all situations, and almost in any ground, so that mixed with deciduous trees, and planted round the exterior, it acts as a nurse, and the office is fully performed long before the termination of its short existence. By this use of the pinaster fir, Cornwall is now acquiring valuable and decorative plantations of the best timber trees, for all which it is indebted to the example given by Mr. Praed. Lelant measures 3,279 statute acres. Annual value of the Real Property as \u00a3. s, d. returned to Parliament in 1815 . . 3165 0 0 Poor Rate in 1831 . . . 462 15 0 Ponulation \u2014 i\"in 1801' I in 1811\u00bb ! in 1821> inlSSl, population,- -j 1083 | n80 | i6Q2> giving an increase of 48 per cent, in 30 years. GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. The western part of this parish rests on granite, which is generally coarse-grained and crystalline, often with laro-e porphyritic crystals of felspar ; here and there it contains beds of porphyry (elvan courses), and also of shorl rock, sometimes in masses, but more frequently in the form of large and irregular veins. This granite has been pro ductive of metallic ores, and more particularly of tin. The eastern part is composed of rocks belonging to the porphyritic series. The principal varieties \u00b0are felspar rock, both massive and schistose, and green-stone. The soil derived from these rocks, as is often the case near granite, is on some spots very fertile. Some land near"], [25, "13 LELANT. the entrance into Hayle is covered with testaceous sand, so common in the vicinity of all the bays and inlets of the sea on the north coast of Cornwall, and which, whenever it is unprotected by vegetation, is drifted by the winds over the uncultivated lands. Nature has pointed out the remedy for this evil to be the diffusion and increase of arenaceous plants. The Editor. \u2014 Whele Reath, a mine on the extreme western border of this parish, where it joins Towednack, has proved more productive of tin than any other mine except Whele Vor ; and it has been prosecuted to a depth unexampled till within these few years, even in mines of copper. At the other extremity of the parish, near the sea-shore, both copper and tin have been found in the belt of green stone which generally interposes between the granite and the sea-shore. LESKEARD. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Leskeard is situate in the hundred of West,. and hath to the west St. Pinnock, to the north St. Clair, to the east. Menhinnet, to the south St. Kaine, and St. Matin's juxta Looe. As for the name of this town and parish, I derive it from les, a court or palace, and kaer, a fortified town, as having been for many ages a seat and castle of the ancient Princes"], [26, "14 LESKEARD. and Dukes of Cornwall. Mr. Carew's derivation from les broad and ker-gone, is so much out of the way that it is not worth confuting ; neither doth he himself put any stress on it. This parish is a vicarge, valued in the King's Books at =\u00a3\u25a018. 13s. 10-i. The patronage in Mr. Blatchford. This church, in A. D. 1291, 29 Edward I., was valued at \u00a38. and the vicarage at \u00a32. 13s. id. it being appro priated to the Priory of Launceston. The great duchy manor of the same name, including the whole parish and borough, I shall first begin with it, and then go on with the town, the church, castle, and the other most noted places in it. THE MANOR OF LESKEARD. In the extent of Cornish acres 12 Edward I. this is valued in 18. The 3d Henry IV. this manor is said to be half of a small fee of Morton, and was then in the hand of the King ; who had not then, it seems, as may be made out in other places of the same book, given livery to Prince Henry of all the lands belonging to the Duchy of Corn wall ; but since that time it having gone with the rest of the Duchy of Cornwall, and accounted for accordingly, I need not say any more of it here; and so come to treat of the TOWN OF LESKEARD. Mr. Willis, in his Rot. Parliamentaria, vol. ii. p. 27, gives this account of it : \" This borough was, in like man ner as spoken of in Launceston, held in the time of the Conqueror by Robert Earl of Morton and Cornwall ; and afterwards, as that did, belonged to Richard, brother to King Henry the Third, created Earl of Cornwall in the 15th year of his reign, who made this place a free borough, and granted to the burgesses all those liberties and free customs which he, by his charter, had before granted to his"], [27, "15 LESKEARD. burgesses of Launceston and Helston. This charter is dated the 5th of June, anno 1240, in the 24th year of the reign of his brother King Henry the Third, about ten years after the date of Launceston charter, as I guess. To this Richard succeeded Edmund Earl of Cornwall, his son, who in the 3d year of the reign of Edward I. granted this whole burgh, with the rent of the same, &c. and toll of the market and fairs, and all fines, mulcts, and perquisites thereof belonging to him and his heirs, in fee farm, at the rent of \u00a318 sterling; upon which conditions the said bo rough being* leased to the townsmen, has remained in their DO ' hands ever since, and the corporation at present enjoy the profits of the fairs and markets, &c. which yield them about \u00a3200 per annum. The royalty of this borough has been in like manner as that at Launceston, vested in the Duchy ever since Edward the Third's time; and the Dukes of Cornwall, tis tenants of the Crown, have received the said fee-farm rent till the reign of the late King William, who alienated the same, and gave it to the present Lord Somers, to whom the corporation pay the abovesaid chief rent of .\u00a318.\" Leland, Itinerary, vol. iii. lob. 19, saith, \" The towne knowlegith freedom and privileges by the gift of Richard, King of Romanes and Earl of Cornewaul.\" Perhaps by him this place was antiently incorporated; but the present charter doth not say when or by whom, for thus runs the last Visitation : ' The towne and burrough of Liskeret, alias Liskerd, was antiently incorporated by the name of Mayor and Burgesses of Liskeret, alias Liskerd, and re-incorpo rated the 6th day of July, in the 29th year of Queen Eliza beth, by the same name of Mayor and Burgesses, and by that name to have perpetual succession ; and enabled in law to purchase lands, tenements, and liberties, and like wise to assign the same, and by the same name to plead and be impleaded ; and that the borough and corporation should consist of 9 Burgesses, which shall be called the Common Councell of the said burrough, whereof one for"], [28, "16 LESKEARD. the time being shall be yearly chosen for Mayor, to have power to chuse a Steward and Recorder. That the Mayor and Burgesses shall have a common seal for their affairs; and that the Mayor and Recorder shall be Justices of the Peace within the said burrough (of which new corporation, granted by Queen Elizabeth, John Hunkin was the first Mayor), with diverse other privileges and immunities, as by their charter doth appear. And at this present visitation, the 12th day of October, 1620, was Edward Chapman, Mayor, Sl William Wrey, Knight, Recorder, John Hun kin, Gent. High Steward, Thomas Jane, John Vosper, Martin Sampson, John Pott, Jeffrie Clarke, Jobn Taperell, and William Grege, Chief Burgesses, and Walter NichoUs, Town Clark, of the said town and burrough.\" Mr. Willis goes on: \" As for the right of election of Members of Parliament, 'tis vested in these nine capital burgesses and fifteen assistants, with others who are free of the borough, as many of the neighbouring gentlemen are ; so that the whole number of electors is near about 100, who are all sworn freemen. The town of Leskeard is very large and populous, and contains (as I am informed) about 500 houses. It has a very considerable market, and per- haps the greatest in this county. It was in Leland's time the best except Bodmin, which it much exceeds now, [this is a great mistake,] as the town does in buildings. This being in all respects one of, if not the biggest and best built in Cornwall [I take Falmouth to exceed by much every way, and so doth Truro too in building, if not big- ness]; 'tis situate partly on rocky hills, and partly in a bottom. On the eastern ascent of the hill stands the church (of which more by and by) . On the north side of the town stood the castle, of which Leland speaks thus : ' There was a castle on an hill in the town side, by north from St. Martin. It is now all in ruin; fragments and pieces of waulles yet stand. The site of it is magnificent, and looketh over all the town. This castle was the Earles of Cornwall.' \""], [29, "17 LESKEARD. Mr. Willis continues: \" In this town is an admirable conduit of water (this Leland too mentions), which plenti fully supplies the streets about the market-place, which lies in a bottom about the middle of the borough; and from thence branch several other streets, divers of which lie on steep ascents. The town is near four furlongs over every wray, and in some parts the houses stand scattered, though the streets are generally broad. This is one of the towns for coinage of tin (but there are hardly blocks of tin coined here in a whole year, the works in its neigh bourhood being rather neglected than worn out) ; and was remarkable, anno 1642, for the defeat of the Parliament army by Sir Ralph Hopton, a memorial of which was put up in the church. The market, in Leland's time men tioned to be observed on the Monday, is now kept on Sa turday. The town hall stands on stone pillars, and is a good building. At the top is a clock-turret, having four dials. It was erected about the year 1707, by Mr. Dol ben, one of the Members for this town, at near ,\u00a3200 ex expense. There has been given also to this corporation very handsome presents of plate, with two large silver maces well gilt, as are several of their silver cups, round one of which, in most constant use, is this engraved : ' Qui fallit poculum, fallit in omnibus.'\" THE EDITOR. Leskeard still continues a place of considerable trade, and distinguished by its excellent market, although in rela tive importance it does not maintain the station among towns in the county assigned to it a hundred years since by Mr. Tonkin. Of late years, several persons possessed of large properties have decorated the environs with excel lent houses; and one gentleman of the town, Mr. Lyne, has brought home from successful trade and speculation, conducted at Lisbon by himself and his uncles during two thirds of a century, a fortune that may be denominated vol. in. c"], [30, "18 LESKEARD. princely. Leskeard has benefited beyond most other towns by the recent improvements of roads, and by a canal from the port of Looe, which affords a cheap and easy convey ance for lime, the most important of all manures in that district. This town has been the residence, if not the origin, of several distinguished persons. Dr. William Jane, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford in the time of Charles the Second, was from hence. And I believe that Mr. Jane, for many years master of the grammar-school at Truro, was his nephew ; and this gen tleman's son, first a student at Christchurch, and after wards Rector of Iron Acton, in Gloucestershire, bore a conspicuous part among the learned divines of his day. From hence also originated the family of Taunton ; of whom Mr. William Elias Taunton, knighted on some oc casion of the King visiting Oxford, attained the highest eminence in that city as a legal practitioner ; and he had the satisfaction of seeing his eldest son attain the proud situation of a judge. Of this family is also Richard Taun ton, M.D. distinguished by his eager pursuit of all scientific acquirements, as well as by his medical skill ; now resident at Truro. To this gentleman's liberality the Editor is in debted for the original manuscript of Mr. Hals' Parochial History, the foundation of this work. Among eminent persons residing at Leskeard, it is im possible to omit Mr. Haydon, for many years master of the grammar-school. Of his classical acquirements it may be sufficient to say that Dr. Cornelius Cardew, who has been mentioned under St.EwStty and must be again under Truro, was his favourite scholar; but, in addition to literature, Mr. Haydon acquired a profound knowledge of mathema tics and of astronomy ; and in these, the most exact and the most noble of sciences, he was not content with theory, and with the practical result of labours carried on by others. Mr. Haydon provided himself with various instruments, of a size and accuracy rarely possessed by individuals at that"], [31, "19 LESKEARD. period; and with those he made important observations on the transit of Venus in June 1769; and for a long time all the longitudes of places in the West of England were de duced from Mr. Haydon's determination of Leskeard. He ultimately retired to the family living of Okeford, in De vonshire, and was succeeded in the school by Mr. Lyne, whose grandson has been noticed for his acquisition of an immense fortune. A gentleman of very singular habits flourished at Les keard through a large portion of the eighteenth century, the last of an ancient and respectable family, Trehawke. No one stood more prominent for ability, knowledge of business, or for integrity; all disputes were referred to his arbitration, and every one pressed eagerly to obtain his advice ; but habits of parsimony grew on him to such an extent, that the most ridiculous tales were circulated of his private savings, without, however, detracting from the esti mation in which he was otherwise held. Having decupled his fortune, he left the whole to a distant relation, Mr. Kekewich, since Member for Exeter, a gentleman altoge ther worthy of so splendid a gift. Mr. Lysons says, \" In the town of Liskeard was a nun nery of poor Clares, founded and endowed by Richard King of the Romans,\" but of which he had not been able to obtain any further account. But this seems to be a mistake; as Richard King of the Romans died in 1271, and the Nuns of St. Clare were first brought into England by Blanch Queen of Navarre, and wife of Edmund Earl of Lancaster, about twenty years afterwards. The monastic remains appear, moreover, too magnificent for an esta blishment of Nuns Minories, or Poor Clares, the female branch of the begging monks or friars instituted by St. Francis. The castle walls have entirely disappeared, but the ele vated site is still conspicuous ; it is surrounded with trees, and the centre is occupied by the school-house. The church is among the largest in Cornwall, and its c2"], [32, "20 LESKEARD. south wall, like that of St. Neot, is embattled, and also or namented by a handsome porch. There is a tradition which describes this church as being decorated with two towers, one on each side of the building, but taken down in the year 1627. The existing western tower is very in ferior to the church The great tithes of this parish were appropriated to the Priory of Launceston. They were granted by Queen Eli zabeth to a Mr. Harris, and they have recently been sold in parcels to the various proprietors of land. Mr. Honey, who holds the vicarage, is also patron. In the church are various monuments to the family of Trehawke, &c. and one to Joseph Wadham, who died in 1707; being the last of that family, founders of Wadham college, Oxford. The house and the room are still shewn which were oc cupied by King Charles the First in August 1644, before the surrender at Fowey of the army commanded by Lord Essex. Mr. Lysons gives an account of the various persons and estates in this parish. The chief proprietors are Mr. Keke wich and Mrs. Connock. The extensive property of the Moreheads has been entirely sold in various lots, and their manor of Lamellian, or Lamellin, now belongs to the Edi tor of this work. The borough, made co-extensive with the parish by the Reform Act of 1832, sends one Member to Parliament. There cannot be a question as to the first syllable in the name of this town being les, a court, or inclosure ; and the second may probably be derived, as Mr. Tonkin conjec tures, from kaer, a fortress; but in times when every thing was referred to the French language, les became changed into lis, and a flower-de-luce was adopted on the town seal.

The rocks of this parish are principally on the boundary of the porphyritic and calcareous series ; partaking of the former in the northern part, and of the latter in the southern. The former sometimes nearly resemble horn blende schist; and, gradually leaving the hornblende, they pass into a coarse, lamellar, argillaceous rock, of a dirty yellowish brown colour, irregularly and indistinctly marked with blue spots. There are several large quarries in this rock round the town of Leskeard, where the stone is exten sively used for building. It very nearly approaches in cha racter to that of Bodmin, but is not quite similar. The Editor. At a short distance from the town, on the road side leading towards Plymouth, occurs a soft micaceous schist, of a deep yellow tinge, which was most unfortunately mistaken for an ore of gold, about fifty years since, by a Mr. Hoskin, of Leskeard, and by his son, a clergyman, who, in utter ignorance of modern science, ex- pended considerable sums of money in erecting machinery, for the prosecution of pursuits so vain as the raising of gold ore and extracting the metal."], [34, "22 LESNEWITH.

Lesnewith is in the hundred of the same name, and hath to the west Trevalgar, to the north Tintagell and Minster, to the east Otterham, to the south Davidstow. I have always imagined, whether rightly or not I am not certain, that this place, instead of giving name to the hun dred, changed its own, when this was divided into two hundreds, Strathan and Lesnewith ; having been formerly but one hundred, called Trigg Major, as they still continue in respect to ecclesiastical affairs ; and if so, then the name signifies the New Court.

A large bed of this peculiar rock oc curs at Grylls or Garles, near the western boundary of the parish. An attempt was made here to burn this rock as a limestone for agricultural purposes; but after several trials it was abandoned ; for, unless great care be taken in select ing those parts alone in which calc spar mainly abounds, the whole charge of the kiln vitrifies, or runs into a slag, owing to the great fusibility of hornblende, the other con stituent of this calcareous rock."], [36, "24 LESTWITHIEL. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Lestwithiel is in the hundred of Powder, and is sur rounded to the west, north, and south, by Lanlivery ; to the east it has Fowy river between it and St. Winnow. As for the name, 1 take it to be a corruption of Les-uchel, i. e. the lofty place, as having been from all antiquity the chief seat of the Dukes, &c. of Cornwall. Mr. Camden in Corn wall saith, \" the Uzella of Ptolemy is seated, and has not yet quite lost its name, being called at this day Lestuthiell, from its situation. Now uchel, in British, signifies the same as high and lofty.\" But of this more when we come to describe the town. As for Mr. Carew's derivation, who calls it Lostwithiel, from the Cornish Losswithiall, which in English, saith he, signifieth a lion's tail, it is so ridicu lous, as not to be worth repeating ; neither doth the word carry that sense. This parish is a vicarage, valued in the King's books at \u00a32. 13s. id. The Duke of Cornwall is patron. The incumbent Mr. Baron, who succeeded Mr. Whiteford. This church is not valued in Tax.

THE TOWN AND BOROUGH OF LESTWITHIEL, \"Reputed,\" saith Mr. Willis, \"the ancient Uzella of Ptolemy, lies situated on the river Uzella,\" (I wonder how Mr. Willis came to be guilty of this mistake, since both Leland and Camden, whom he quotes, tell him that it lies on the river Fowy,) \"from which it more probably had its"], [37, "25 LESTWITHIEL. name, as the learned Camden thinks\" ( Mr. Camden says as I have quoted him above,) \"than from Carew's inter pretation of the word Lestwithiel, which he would have to signify in English, lion's tail. This town is reputed in for mer times to have stood on a high hill, where the old castle of Lestormel showeth its ruins, which with a park thereto belonging, lies on the north side of the town\" (and is in the parish of Lanlivery, for which reason it is not treated of here). \" In the park was a Chapel of the Trinity, long since defaced, as are the public buildings of the town, in somuch that little remains of them ; though some small parts are repaired, and made use of for the prisons and courts belonging to the Tin Stannaries, which are appointed to be kept here, this being one of the coinage towns.\" Before I go on any further with Mr. Willis, it may be proper to insert at length what Mr. Camden saith of it. \" More within the land, on the same river (Fowy), the Uzella of Ptolemy is seated ; and has not quite lost its name, being called at this day Lestuthiell, from its situation ; for it was upon a high hill, where is Listormel, an ancient castle ; though now it is removed into the valley. Now Uchel, British, signifies the same as high and lofty ; from whence Uxellodunum of Gaule is so termed, because the town be ing built upon a mountain, has a steep rugged ascent every way. This in the British history is called Pen-Uchel-Coit, a high mountain in a wood, by which some will have Exe ter meant. But the situation assigned it by Ptolemy, and the name it has to this day, do sufficiently evince it to have been the ancient Uzella. Now it is a little town, and not at all populous ; for the channel of the river Fowy, which in the last age used to carry the tide up to the very town, and bring vessels of burthen, is now so stopped up by the sands coming from the tin-mines, that it is too shallow for barges; and indeed, all the havens in this county are in danger of being choaked up by their sands. However, it is the county town, where the Sheriff every month holds the County Court, and the Warden of the Stannaries has his"], [38, "26 LESTWITHIEL. prison. For it has the privilege of coinage, by the favour (as they say) of Edmund Earl of Cornwall, who formerly had his palace there. But there are two towns which especially eclipse the glory of this Uzella, \u2014 Les- kerd to the east, and Bodman to the north.\" Now to return to Mr. Willis. \" It is a very ancient cor- poration, belonging to the Duchy, having had great privileges conferred upon it by Richard Earl of Cornwall (so saith Leland, Itinerary, vol. III. fol. 16,) who, when he was King of the Romans, in the twelfth year of his reign, by charter dated at Wallington, made Lostwithiel and Penknek (alias Penkneth, in the parish of Lanliversey, for Lanlivery, saith Leland, in the above cited place,) a place near adjoining, and now part of the borough, one free burgh, and granted his burgesses a gild mercatory, &c. When this place was first incorporated, I have not been informed ; but it has returned Members to Parlia ment ever since 4 Edw. II. and once before, viz. 23 Edw. I. The Representatives are chosen by the majority of the Corporation, which consists of seven capital burgesses (whereof one is Mayor), and seventeen assistants, in whom, as I presume, the fee-farm rent of the borough is vested, who hold the same, or not many years since did, of the Duchy. This Corporation (otherwise a poor one) holds also the anchorage in the harbour, and bryhelage of mea sureable commodities, as coals, salt, malt, and corn, &c. in the town of Fowey ; which port lies lower on this river, which was navigable to this town before the sands barred it up. The town of Lestwithiel consists chiefly of two streets, from east to west, meanly built, and has in it a church (of which more at the end). In August 1644, some soldiers of the Parliament Army, as may be seen in Dugdale's Short View of the late Trou bles in England, p. 560, defaced several stately edifices in this town, as the great Hall and Exchequer of the Dukes of Cornwall, who had their palace here in times past ; this having been formerly reputed the shire town of the county,"], [39, "LESTWITHIEL. 27 a small branch of which it yet retained], viz. the election of knights of the shire, and keeping the county weights and measures, which it had assigned by Act of Parliament, anno 1 1 Hen. VII. Who held this manor (note, that this place is no manor, but Penknek.) at the making of Domes day Book, the learned Dr, Brady could not discover; but no doubt it was reckoned among those of Robert Earl of Moreton and Cornwall, the King's brother. Though in the reign of Richard I. it was part of the demesne lands of Robert de Cardinan Lord of Fowey, who was returned debtor into the Exchequer, of ten marks due to the King for having a market at Lestwithiel. Robertus de Cardinan debet decem marcas pro habendo Foro apud Lostwithel. Mag. Rot. 6 Ric. I. Rot. 12 a. m. 2, Cornwallia. However, this town belonged, temp. Hen. III. to Richard Earl of Corn wall, King Richard's nephew, upon the death of whose son Edmund, it became part of the King's demesne, and anno 7 Edw. III. upon the creation of John Earl of Cornwall, the King's brother, he had this borough, inter alia, granted him ; which was afterwards assigned to Edward the King's son, when he was made Duke of Cornwall, and became, upon his death, the jointure or dowry of Joan Princess of Wales, his wife ; on whose decease, anno 9 Ric. II. the King granted it to Tho. Holland Earl of Kent, his (half) brother, who held for life the manors of Lestwithiel and Camelford; he died in the 20th Ric. II. His son Thomas was created Duke of Surrey, and was beheaded anno 1 Hen. IV.\" Mr. Willis having a little mistaken this, I have thus rectified it. After the death of which last Thomas, (who also held them for life), Sir John Cornwall, Lord Fanhope, obtained a grant of the same on account of mar rying Elizabeth, the King's sister ; and obtained a grant of the same from Henry Prince of Wales to enjoy them dur ing her life ; and afterwards procured it for his own life, and died accordingly seised thereof in December 1443 (22 Hen. VI.) as may be seen in Dugdale's Baronage."], [40, "28 LESTWITHIEL. The yearly rent of this borough, payable to the Duke of Cornwall, is in Doddridge's History of that Duchy, p. 108, set down at<fll. 19s. 10*K The town is situated between hills. Boats of ten and twenty tons come up hither. Here are about 70 houses ; and the manor is in the duchy. THE EDITOR. Lestwithiel evidently owes its locality to that which de termined in early times the site of all towns placed on the banks of navigable rivers. They were universally built on the highest point to which vessels or boats frequenting the estuary were capable of being carried by the tide. Richard Plantagenet might well have been captivated by the beauties of this place and of the surrounding country, by its central situation, and by the commanding eminence of Restormal. Here the last of our real feudal princes, whether he originally built or only enlarged the castle, fixed his court, and collected those revenues with which he is said to have bought from the venal electors of Germany, the titular office of King of the Romans; conveying, how ever, the legal right of succession to the throne of his grandfather the Emperor Henry the Fifth. Nummus ait pro me, nubit Cornubia Rom\u00e6. Carew, 204, Lord Dunstanville's edit To Richard King of the Romans Lestwithiel is indebted for the remains of the palace or stannary buildings, and for its privileges. The palace, if it was ever the residence of a Prince, has long since been converted into a prison, with apartments for occasionally holding the Stannary Courts. Various charters have been granted to this town. The last was given in the reign of King George the Second, by which seven permanent Aldermen annually chose, for one"], [41, "29 LESTWITHIEL. year, seventeen other persons, misnamed freemen, who altogether formed the select body for electing Members of Parliament. The validity of this charter has never been contested ; but a doubt can scarcely be entertained of ali- its being utterly void, at least as to constituting a Parliamen tary grant, on the ground of its entire variance from the common law of the land : but this question has now lost its importance in consequence of the Reform enacted in 1832. The church possesses a character unusual in the west of England, by having its nave elevated, with a series of win dows above the two ailes. It contains several monuments, and a curious antique font. The etymology of this town, like that of Leskeard, has suffered from modern caprice, the Les having been here changed into Los; as Dover, from some strange fancy, is rapidly passing into Dovor.

Dr. Boase says of the geology of this little parish, that it is composed of the same schistose rocks as the eastern part of the parish of Lanlivery."], [42, "30 ST. LEVAN. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. St. Levan is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and is bounded to the west by the ocean, to the north by Sennon, to the east by St. Burian, to the south by the mouth of the Channel. This parish taketh its name from the saint to whom the church is dedicated, St. Levine. It is a daughter church of St. Burian, forming part of the deanery of St. Burian. THE EDITOR. St. Levan exceeds perhaps every other parish in the whole county for bold and romantic scenery. First it possesses Trereen Dinas. This magnificent promontory has towards the land one of those ancient entrenchments which so much distinguish the western coast, from whence the word dinas. There the point runs out into the sea, rising into a succession of na tural granite towers in spires, and aiguilles, and the first presenting a perpendicular front, is crowned with the far famed Loging Rock. Without calling in question the religious uses made of this stone in rude and barbarous times, it may be declared as a certainty to be entirely natural. Among the thousands of rocks lying scattered in all directions, some possessing a convex surface have accidentally rested on the flat surface of another. Many such rocks are known, but this one tran scends in size, and occupies a most commanding station. The rock has been measured with the greatest care, and it is"], [43, "31 ST. LEVAN. believed to weigh about ninety tons, yet any one, by applying his shoulder to the edge, and favouring the vibrations, can easily cause the stone to log through a very sensible angle. Doctor Borlase, in his most learned and ingenious specu lations on the religion and policy of the Druids, paid consi derable attention to rock monuments in general, and espe cially to this, the most remarkable of all. In p. 180 of the Antiquities, second edition, Doctor Borlase says, \" In the parish of St. Levan, Cornwall, there is a promontory called Castle Treryn. This cape consists of three distinct groupes of rocks. On the western side of the middle groupe, near the top, lies a very large stone, so evenly poised, that any hand may move it to or fro ; but the extremities of its base are at such a distance from each other, and so well secured by their nearness to the stone which it stretches itself upon, that it is morally impossible that any lever, or indeed force (however applied in a mechanical way) can remove it from its present situation.\" This rather over-strong expression piqued the vanity of a gallant and intrepid officer, commanding an armed vessel on the coast, in 1824, who maintained that nothing could be impossible to the courage and skill of British seamen, and therefore, attended by ten or twelve of his men, Lieu tenant Goldsmith, nephew of the celebrated novelist and poet (for it would even be unjust to withhold his name, as connected with a transaction on the whole redounding to his credit), went on the eighth of April to the rock, and there, by a continued application of their united strength, they threw this huge mass into vibrations of such extent as to cause the convex surface at last to slide from its hori zontal base, most fortunately in the direction opposite to that in which they stood. The rock was saved from falling to the ground, and from thence probably into the sea, by a narrow chasm which caught it in the descent. Mr. Goldsmith having thus achieved what had been de clared impossible by the highest authority that Cornwall could produce, must have congratuled himself on such com-"], [44, "32 Sl. LEVAN. plete success ; but the sensations of all the neighbourhood were entirely at variance from those of the gallant officer; fears were even entertained for his life ; and a meeting of the Magistrates and principal persons was contemplated, for the purpose of representing the affair to Government : but the Editor of this work being then in London, and having the honour of being known to all the Lords of the Admiralty, he went there, and representing the exploit that had been performed in the light of an indiscreet frolic, he proposed that the Admiralty should lend a proper ap- paratus, and send it from Plymouth, while he on his part would endeavour to raise an adequate sum of money ; and that Lieutenant Goldsmith, having thrown down this natu ral curiosity, should superintend the putting it up again. The terms were accepted, and thirteen capstans, with blocks, chains, &c. were sent from the dock-yard. The Editor having commenced a contribution of money with twenty-five pounds, raised it to a hundred and fifty; and on the 2d of November, in the presence of thousands, amidst ladies waving their handkerchiefs, men firing feux- de-joye, and universal shouts, Mr. Goldsmith had the satis- faction and the glory of replacing this immense rock in its natural position, uninjured in its discriminating properties. In consequence of the Editor making a second applica- tion to the Admiralty, and of his commencing another con- tribution of money with five pounds, Lanyon Cromlech was also replaced by the same apparatus. The walk of about a mile and a half along the cliffs from Trereen Dinas to St. Levan Church, is grand and ro mantic in the highest degree. Between the two points is inclosed Porth Kernow, where the water is beautifully transparent, over a fine sand composed in part of minute shells quite entire, and of various species and genera, to be collected on the beach. The church itself is in a most se questered spot, and said by Mr. Tonkin to be dedicated to St. Levina, who was a British female, and suffered martyr-"], [45, "33 ST. LEVAN. dom under the Saxons before their conversion to the Chris tian faith. The relics of St. Levine or Lewine were long preserved and honoured at Seaford, about ten miles from Eastbourn in Sussex, till, in 1058, eight years before the Norman Con quest, her remains, together with those of St. Idaberga, another female, and a portion of the relics of St. Oswald, were carried beyond the seas, and deposited in the abbey of St. Winock at Bergh in Flanders, amidst a variety of miracles attested by Drogo, an eye-witness, and published in the great collection of the Bollandists. The only object worthy of attention in St. Levan church is a plain monument to Miss Thomasin Dennis, with the following inscription : Thomasin Dennis, de Trembath, ingenio, suavitate, virtute insignis, doctrina insignissima. Nata xxix die Septembris, 1771, v\u00e6! lenta sed pr\u00e6matura morte erepta obiit xxx die Augusti 1809, anno \u00e6tatis xxxviii. Miss Dennis was born at Sawah in this parish, the daughter of Mr. Alexander Dennis, one of the superior class of farmers, who occupy their own estates held at quit rents for lives. He afterwards removed to Trembath in Maddern. Her superior genius displayed itself at a very early age, in reciting poetry from our best authors, and then in producing imitations of her own. \" She lisped in numbers from her mother's arms.\" French was acquired with equal accuracy and facility ; and then, observing that her eldest brother appeared to make an inadequate pro- VOL.

The celebrity which Miss Dennis had now acquired, brought her acquainted with the Rev. Mr. Hitchins, the learned vicar of St. Hilary, with the Editor of this work, and with several others, more or less scholars, from all of whom she received the praises due to her superior talents, and such instruction or assistance as they could afford, by lending books, or by indicating the most approved methods of proceeding; and with such slender help her progress was so great and almost unexampled, that not only were all the Roman authors soon read, but the Greek writers followed in a rapid succession, till \u00c6schylus and Pindar became her familiar acquaintance. About this time Miss Dennis was induced to accompany Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Wedgewood from Penzance, chiefly as a friend and a visitor, but partly also, in return for their civilities and kindness, to overlook the progress of their son ; but her health began to fail, her only sister fell into a consumption, she returned to nurse her, and died of the same most pitiable complaint.

Miss Dennis proved herself adequate to the composition of any work in prose, by publishing in 1806, at Mr. Johnson's in St. Paul's Churchyard, \" Sophia St. Clare,\" in name indeed a novel, but far superior in style of writing and in correct ness of sentiment, to the fictions of the day. From the want of incident, however, similar to those which are cha racterized in the drama by producing stage effect, the work failed of becoming popular. This parish, after Trereen Dinas, is distinguished by"], [47, "ST. LEVAN. 35 the possession of Tol-Peder- Penwith, about a mile west ward from the church, the approach to which lies under romantic cliffs, and crosses a short deep vale, where boats are sheltered in a small cove apparently inacces sible to human art or daring. At the very extremity of the point an excavation has been made by the sea, of some portion less compacted than the remainder of the rock, probably of a lode, which opens to the surface in the form of an inverted cone. This place is'very dangerous of access, on account of the steep descent covered by a slip pery turf; but strangers are tempted to risk their lives in approaching the abyss, by the dashing of the waves within it, and by the tremendous roar of the sea. Two gentlemen from London were induced to enter the cavern leading from the sea, and were surrounded by the tide. One, who excelled in swimming, fortunately got out and communi cated the perilous situation of his companion to a neigh bouring farmer, who hastened with assistance and with ropes to the spot, and succeeded in lifting him to the sur face through the cone. Nor must the circumstance be omitted, that, although the stranger was possessed of a very large fortune, he could not prevail on his rescuer to accept of the least pecuniary rewaid for preserving the life of a fellow-creature. The villages in this parish are of small importance. Bosistow belonged in remote times to a family of the same name, giving for their arms Azure, three escallops Vaire. Mr. Bosistow, now residing at Tredreath in Lelant, is believed to represent this ancient familj'. In more recent times Bosistow belonged to the Davieses. All the farms in this parish have been constantly oc cupied either by the freeholders or by persons possessing leaseholds, paying quit-rents, for lives; in consequence, they have taken extreme care against making parishioners, and in managing their Poor Rate, as will appear from its small amount. d 2"], [48, "36 ST.

This parish is entirely situated on granite, which in many places furnishes a good and fertile soil, as has been observed in the adjoining parish of St. Burian. Its fine sea cliffs exhibit many varieties of the granite, and dis tinctly show the manner of arrangement in the more com mon and larger masses. To enter on the details of this subject, would occupy too much space. The geologist will find ample amusement along the whole line of these cliffs, which are always viewed by the romantic tourist with great delight. Besides the elevation and grand contour of the cliffs, here will be found the celebrated Logan Rock at Trereen, and the Tunnel Rock at Tol-Peder- Penwith. THE EDITOR. It may be observed, that I have always used the words Log-ing Rock, for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas. Much learned research seems to have been idly expended on the supposed name, \" Logan Rock.\" To log, is a verb in general use throughout Cornwall, for vibrating or roll ing like a drunken man ; and an is frequently heard in pro vincial pronunciation for ing, characteristic of the modern present participle. The Loging Rock is therefore strictly descriptive of its peculiar motion."], [49, "37 LEWANNICK. LEWANNICK. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Lewannick is in the hundred of East, and hath to the west and north Alternun, to the east South Pederwin, to the south North Hill. The right name of this parish is Lanwennock; and it is dedicated to the same Wennack as Landewednack. It is a vicarage valued in the King's Books at \u00a31. 18s. 2d. The patronage in the Crown. This is but a poor parish, and hath not many noted places in it. The most considerable is the manor of Trelask, Trelask, that is the burnt town, from such an accident I suppose happening there. I take this to be the most ancient seat of the Lowers in this county ; who in the last century were a flourishing family, divided into several branches, though now the females have carried off the estates into other families, and there are very few of the males remaining. On the death of Edward Roper, Esq. this manor fell to Plowden, Esq. descended from the famous lawyer of that name, who is the present lord of it. THE EDITOR. The parish church is distinguished by some remains of Gothic ornaments, and by its lofty tower. Within the church are some recent monuments to the Archers of Tre-"], [50, "38 LEWANNICK. lask, and one to the Rev. W. A. Morgan, the late vicar. There are also several ancient monuments, but greatly de- faced. The villa-res in this parish are small, and the houses are o-enerally constructed of the* least durable materials. The principal are Hick's Mill, Pollyfont, Trenhorne, and Tre vadlack. The manor of Trelaske, having originally belonged to a family of the same name, came to the Uptons. It is stated by Mr. Lysons that two co-heiresses of the Upton family married two brothers of the Lowers, between whom the property was divided. One half passed to the family of Plowden ; and the other half was sold by Thomas Lower, Esq. who died in 1703, to John Addis, Esq. whose son purchased the share of William Plowden and others. In 1741, William Addis, Esq. bequeathed the whole to Nicholas Swete Archer, Esq. in whose collateral heirs it still remains. Trelaske is a handsome gentleman's seat, and surrounded by extensive woods. Mr. Nicholas Swete Archer married a sister of the late Mr. Francis Basset, of Tehidy, and resided chief!)' at Truro in a house the property of Mr. Enys, of Enys, who had married another sister of Mr. Francis Basset ; this gentleman dying without children, left Trelaske to his nephew, whose son greatly improved the house and the place ; but has recently been taken out of this life at an early age, leaving a numerous family amply provided with the gifts of fortune, and con soled by the recollection of a parent universally respected and esteemed. The manor of Tinney Hall belonged to the family of Beaumont ; the last possessor of that name, Mrs. Dorothy Beaumont, bequeathed it to her nephew Mr. John Speccot, of Penheal, from whom it passed to his relation Mr. Thomas Long (see Egloskerry), and the manor now be longs to his heir-at-law the Rev. Charles Sweet. The etymology given by Mr. Tonkin for Trelaske does not seem to be very probable. The verb Los5i is in"], [51, "39 LEWANNICK. Cornish to burn ; but it does not approach nearly to the sound of laske, and the derivation has not any support from tradition at this place, nor in Cubert, nor in Pelynt, where the name occurs. The manor of Pollyfont was heretofore a parcel of the priory of Minster near Botreaux Castle *, and has been annexed to the rectory of Minster parish. Some remains of a chapel are still to be seen at this place. The great tithes belonged to the family of Gedy or Giddy, of Trebersey, from whom they descended to Mr. John Eliot, heir-at-law of the celebrated patriot Sir John Eliot, who married the heiress of that family ; and they were by him devised, with the whole of his property, to Mr. William Eliot, second brother of Lord Eliot, of Port Eliot, now Lord St. Germans, who has parted with them to Mr. William Hocker, of Trewanta in this parish.

Lezant is in the hundred of East, and hath to the west Lewannick and Linkinhorne, to the north South Pederwin and Lawhitton, to the east the river Tamar, to the south Stoke Climsland. \u00bb 4 Lezant is an abbreviation of Lansant, the Holy Church, and so it is written in the Taxatio Beneficiorum ; so called, perhaps, as being dedicated to All the Saints: so that Lezant may signify the same as All Hallows. It is a rectory, valued in the King's Books at \u00a332. The patron is the Bishop of Exeter. The incumbent is the Rev. Mr. John Grant, Rector likewise of Ruan Lany horne, Canon of Exeter, and son-in-law to the present Bishop, Dr. Stephen W'eston. The first place of note that offers itself in this parish, is the manor of Trecarell, which gave name to an eminent family, seated here (as it is said) before the Norman Con quest, who gave for their arms, Ermine, two chevrons Sable. Next, Landew, the black inclosure ; aptly enough (in my opinion) so called, as being under a dismal hill. This place was for several descents the seat of a younger branch of the family of Trefusis : the last of which, Nicho las Trefusis, of this place, was chosen Knight for this county in Parliament, to succeed Sir Bevil Granville, as Mr. Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan, was to succeed Sir Alexander Carew; both which knights fell for the King's cause in 1643 and 1644, the first by the sword, at the battle of Lansdowne, the other by the axe, on Tower Hill. The said Nicholas Trefusis had by his wife two daughters"], [53, "41 LEZANT. and coheirs : Mary, married in her father's lifetime to Edward Herle, of Prideaux, Esq. and Catherine, married after his death to Richard Kelliow, Esq. Mr. Trefusis, by his will, bearing date August 13, 1647, settled (inter alia) this barton, with its appurtenances, called his barton and demesnes of Landew and Dinham's land, with the Almes Pool Meadow, and Greston Moor, on the said Mr. Herle and Mary his wife, and their heirs for ever. Mr. Herle settled in this place his eldest son, who new built the house here, but did not live to finish it, for he died in his father's lifetime, leaving by his wife two sons, Edward and Nicholas, and several daughters. Edward Herle, Esq. seated himself and family here, was Sheriff of Cornwall in the 12th year of Ann, 1713; and was a Member in the last Parliament for the town of Launceston. A gentleman of bright parts, a lovely aspect, and admired and esteemed by all that had the happiness to know him, \u2014 I may say by all that ever heard of his name and character ; but being miserably tormented by the gout, so as to be a perfect cripple with it, he died in the best of his time, at this place; leaving by his wife, the daughter of Northmore, of Oakhampton, in Devon, Esq. North more Herle, Esq. who is now about twenty years of age. His mother is since married again to Charles Kendall, M.D. second son to Archdeacon Kendall, of Killigarlh, who has left her a widow, for the second time, with five daughters. Since the above was written, Northmore Herle, Esq. has died at Oxford, unmarried, in May 1737, in the 22d year of his age. THE EDITOR. This parish seems to be inserted among others belonging to the hundred of East, in the valuation of Pope Nicholas, under the name Ecclesia de Sacre, and valued at \u00a35. Trecarrell, but slightly noticed by Mr. Tonkin, appears"], [54, "42 LEZANT. to have been a place of considerable consequence. The last of the original family bearing the same name, was living there in the year 1540, when, having lost his only son, Sir Henry Trecarrell built the beautiful church at Laun ceston. On this gentleman's decease, the property became divided among his three daughters; but at the period of the Civil Wars Trecarrell had passed into other hands, and Mr. Maneton, then proprietor, entertained King Charles the First, on the 1st day of August 1644, previ ously to his proceeding to Leskeard, and from thence to the surrender of the army commanded by Lord Essex. Mr. Maneton died in 1654, since which time it has ceased to be a mansion. The property is now vested in Sir Tho mas Acland, and Mr. Geake who resides on the place, where some portions of the ancient building are still to be seen, especially the remains of a hall, and of a chapel dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen. Landew also bestowed a name on its ancient proprie tors, or received it from them ; two of whom occur in the list of Members returned to Parliament for Launceston. Mr. Tonkin has mentioned the early death of Mr. North more Herle : this gentleman devised Landew to one of his half-sisters, daughter of Dr. Kendall, from whom it de scended to the late Mr. Humphry Lawrence, of Launces ton, who sold it to Mr. Wrilliam Bant. But the place has been sold again, and is now the residence of John Thomas Phillipps, Esq. representative, with Mr. Carpenter of Mount Tavy, of the Phillippses of Newport and Camelford. Landew had formerly a chapel dedicated to St. Bridget ; and there was a third in the parish, dedicated to St. Lawrence. . Carthamartha, a part of the great manor of Lawhitton, leased by Bishop Lavington to his daughter, is the occa sional residence of Mr. John Gould, a place beautifully situated on the banks of the Tamar river, the most roman tic of all the mountain torrents in the West of England.

THE MANOR OF CARNEDON PRIOR. THE ROCKY HILL. In Domesday Book is a manor called Carneten, which I believe to be this. And if so, it was one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Mor ton, when he made him Earl of Cornwall. THE EDITOR. The manors of Millaton and Carnadon Prior belong to the Duchy of Cornwall ; the latter had belonged to the Priory of Launceston, and is one of the manors given in ex change by King Henry the Eighth for the honour of Wal lingford. On the waste of this manor stands the lofty hill usually called Carraton Downs, supposed, with the exception of Brown Willy (which is elevated 1368 feet above the sea) to be the highest land in Cornwall. Here King Charles the First drew up his forces on the 2d of August, 1644, and was joined by Prince Maurice. The manor of Trefrize or Trefy is said to have belonged, at a remote period, to the family of Trefey. It belonged to Sir Henry Trecarrell, of Trecarrell, in Lezant, and became split among his daughters. It is now again united in the family of Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. Some accounts repre-"], [57, "45 LINKINHORNE. sent this place as having been very magnificent, and the re- sidence of a Lord (qu. Laird ?) Trefey. In this parish are several elevated points of land covered with granite or other crystaline rocks in the most magnifi cent groups, and commanding extensive prospects, first over this rugged ground, then across the Tamar, and its fer tile vale, with Hamoaze, Plymouth, and the Sound, having the whole bounded by the mountains of Dartmoor. Among the most remarkable of those points or carnes are Sharp or Sharpy Tor, the Cheese Wring, and the Hur lers.

HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Ludgian is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and hath to the west Maddern, to the north Lelant and Towedneck, to the east St. Erth and St. Hilary, to the south Gulval and the Mount's Bay. Mr. Gwavas derives the name from Lug Var, the high or hilly placed tower. To which the situation of this church does very well agree. This is a rectory valued in the King's book at \u00a330. 1 Is. Qd. The patronage in the Duke of Bolton. At the Taxation of Pope Nicholas, in 1291, this church is valued at \u00a37 a year, having never been appropriated; and it is there called Ecclesia de Ludewon. The chief place in this parish, on which stands the church, is the manor of Ludgian Lease, that is, Ludgian place, or inclosed land. In Domesday Book it is called Ludaham, being one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to his half-brother, Robert Earl of Morton. THE EDITOR. The manor of Ludgean Lease has been of great conse quence and extent. It still spreads over lands in several parishes; and holds as appendages the advowson to the rectory of this parish, and the high lordship of St. Ives, where certain honorary perquisites are paid to the lord of this manor for ships entering the port ; and moreover, on the day of holding the annual court, the corporation maces are borne before the steward. Mr. Lysons states that the"], [59, "47 LUDGVEN, OR LUDGEAN. manor was given by Richard Earl of Cornwall to the family of Ferrers ; from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to those of Champernown and Willoughby (Lord Broke), and from a coheiress of the latter to the family of Paulet; and it now belongs to the two daughters, or their descendants, of Henry Paulet, last Duke of Bolton, who died in 1794. Treassow has been for a considerable time the seat of the family of Rogers, since removed to Penrose, in the neighbourhood of Helston, in consequence of a large for tune acquired there by Mr. John Rogers, as steward to the Godolphins. Annexed to Treassow is Castle-an-Dinas, the most loft}' hill in that whole district, and the one standing furthest towards the south. It differs, however, from all the other hills thereabout in the quality of its material; for, although the whole is granite, not a rock is to be seen, and at its north-western base works are carried on, similar to those near St. Austell for preparing china-clay. On the top of the hill a considerable part remains of the extensive dinas, entrenchment, or castle, that has given the name, redupli cated in modern times, from an entire forgetfulness of the Celtic language. Borlase gives the following description of these remains : \" Castle-an-Dinas consisted of two stone walls, one within the other, in a circular form, surrounding the area of the hill. The ruins are now fallen on each side of the walls, and show the work to have been of great height and thickness. There was also a third, or outer wall, built more than halfway round. Within the walls are many little inclosures of a circular form, about seven yards diameter, with little walls round them of two or three feet high ; they appear to have been so man \u2022 huts for the shelter of the garrison. The dia- meter of the whole fort from east to west is four hundred feet, and the principal ditch sixty feet. Towards the south, the sides of the hill are marked by two large VOL. III. d 8"], [60, "LUDGVEN, OR LUDGEAN. 48 green paths, about ten feet wide. Near the middle of the area is a well, almost choked up with its own ruins, and at a little distance a narrow pit, its sides walled round, pro bably for water also, now filled up.\" On this account the following remarks have been made by a recent intelligent writer : * \" It is to be regretted that Borlase did not publish a plan to illustrate his description of this Castle, as it has been much dilapidated since his time. A tower was built on the site of the outer wall about forty years ago, by Mr. Rogers, of Penrose; and subsequent reparations have not contributed towards a restoration of the old walls. Nor are there any perceptible remains of the inclosures, two or three feet high, which formed the huts for the shelter of the garrison ; but in this respect, Borlase's description exactly corresponds with the remains I ob served within the area of Chun-Castle, as already men tioned. I could discover no traces of the ancient en trance, nor does Borlase notice it ; if it was towards the west, as at Chun-Castle, it has been blocked up, for the walls on that side seem to have been rebuilt or repaired ; if on the southern side, where, Borlase says, there were two broad paths leading up the side of the hill, towards the Castle, it has been totally destroyed. \" I now proceed to a description of this ancient and curious fortress. The first inclosure is a mound of earth alone, seven or eight feet high, surrounded by a ditch. Within this, a second fosse, or ditch, encircled the outer wall, which was built as before described, and is about five feet in thickness, and four or five high, excepting towards the south-east, where it has been destroyed, and * Extracted from an \" Account of certain Hill Castles, near the Land's End in Cornwall,\" by William Cotton, Esq. F.S.A. printed in the Arch\u0153o logia, vol. xxn. where a plan and section of Castle-an-Dinas will be found, taken with greater care than that in Lysons's Cornwall. In the Gentleman's Magazine, lxxii. p. 393, are engravings of two stone weights found within the inner circle of this fortress. The weight of one was seventeen pounds and a half ; and that of the other three pounds one ounce."], [61, "49 LUDGVEN, OR LUDGEAN, the materials used in building the tower before men- tioned. \" A vallum, or terrace, separates this wall from another of considerable strength and thickness, being thirteen feet across at the top. The circular area inclosed by this wall is two hundred and fifty-four feet in diameter. A third wall, of no great substance or height, like the others, appears to have made a circuit within this space, and re duced the diameter to one hundred and ninety feet. But what is most curious in this Castle, is the appearance of a certain wavy outline, slightly raised above the natural soil, but overgrown with turf. The singular form of these foundations, if they are supposed to be the inclosures noticed by Borlase, and their exact regularity, which I took some pains to ascertain, is perhaps deserving the attention of some more experienced antiquary. \" The area within is very uneven, and has, nearly in the centre, a small round inclosure, twenty-two feet in dia meter, without an entrance. It is exactly similar in its construction to the remains in Caer-Brane and Bartine Castles. There is a well also within the circuit of the walls, and we were told it was never known to be without water. The diameter of the whole work, from ditch to ditch, north and south, is four hundred and thirty-six feet.\" Rosevithney was for ages a gentleman's residence. The family of Larmer possessed it during a considerable time,. till it passed by an heiress to a branch of the Davieses. The freehold has recently been sold three or four times. Trowell, an adjoining farm, which belonged to the Go dolphins, is remarkable for the extremely productive cop per-mine, called Whele Fortune, which first launched Mr. Lemon on his splendid voyage through life. The name of another farm in Ludgean, which cannot be accidental, requires notice. On this farm was a well, now destroyed by mines, having, in all probability, some slight quality of a chalybeate. The water acquired an established reputation for the relief of weak sight, and hundreds re- VOL. III. d 9"], [62, "50 LUDGVEN, OR LUDGEAN. paired there every year to bathe their eyes. The firm is named Collurian, and has been so time out of mind. Varfull has been held as a leasehold for lives, or under copy of court roll, for more than a century, by the family of Davy, and actually belonged to Sir Humphry Davy, whose name has reflected so much honour, not on Cornwall alone, but on the whole nation to which he belonged. The church, with the church town and the rectory, are placed in a commanding situation, and being surrounded by trees, make one of the most pleasing objects in the Mount's Bay. The house has been entirely rebuilt by the late rector Mr. John Stephens. The tower is one of the most correct in its proportions and in its ornaments of any in the west of Cornwall. About the year 1761, a pin nacle was thrown down by lightning, and the effect was then universally imputed to the vengeance of a perturbed spirit exorcised from Treassow, and passing eastward to wards the usual place of banishment in the Red Sea. A more ancient legend is also connected with this church. After St. Ludgvan, an Irish missionary, if such a one ever existed, had constructed the fabric, he brought a stream of water under the church stile, with the intention of bestow- ing on the water various miraculous powers ; among others, that of enabling every infant sprinkled with it at the bap- tismal font, instantly to acquire the power of making all the responses in distinct words, and probably in the Latin tongue ; but, being interrupted by some unhallowed inter- ference, his general purposes were defeated, so that one alone of the many intended qualities could by possibility be con- ferred ; a qaality very different from the former, but so much esteemed by some descriptions of persons, that, within times of memory, children are reported to have been brought there for baptism, to acquire the protection af- forded by this consecrated stream, which, after washing away the stain of original sin, does not indeed effectually guard the infant against committing crimes of his own, but against ever expiating them through the medium of an"], [63, "LUDGVAN, OR LUDGIAN. 49 hempen cord ; and experience is said to have proved that the charm does not extend to one of silk. But the church of Ludgvan is not driven to seek renown from ancient missionaries or from legendary saints : during fifty years of the eighteenth century, it had for its rector Dr. William Borlase, a man of whom Cornwall will ever have reason to be proud. At a time when the very names of natural science were scarcely heard among us, and when our mining and me- tallurgic processes were matters merely empiric, Dr. Bor- lase kindled the first spark of light, and fanned it by long- continued and able exertions, guided by a correspond- ence with persons the most distinguished on the continent of Europe, as well as at home, with the great Linn\u00e6us, and with Boerhaave, in some departments superior even to Linn\u00e6us himself. When no communications were main- tained by the rapid circulation of periodical journals, an- tiquities, as connected with classical acquirements, had proceeded much further than the sciences dependent on mathematics and on natural philosophy. Dr. Borlase, in a most learned work, essayed to trace the learning, the mythology, and the civil institutions of the Celtic people, the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and especially of their priests the Druids ; and with such success, that it esta- blished his high reputation for learning, for extensive re- search, and for discriminating judgment, throughout the literary world, where the subject, from its general nature, excited universal attention. For ihis work the degree of Doctor in Civil Law by diploma was conferred on him by the University of Oxford; an honour bestowed with so much discrimination and regard to its high value, that the next instance occurs in the case of Dr. Johnson, about ten years afterwards.

William Borlase, LL.D. a very ingenious and learned writer, was of an ancient family in Cornwall, and born at Pendeen in the parish of St. Just, February 2d, 1695-6. His father had represented St. Ives in Parlia ment. Mr. Borlase received the early part of his education at Penzance, but in 1709 removed to Plymouth. In March 1712-13 he became a member of Exeter College; and in June 1719, took his degree of Master of Arts. In 1720 he was ordained priest, and in 1722 he received institution to the rectory of Ludgvan in Cornwall. In 1732 the Lord Chancellor King presented him to the vicarage of St. Just, his native parish, the only preferments he ever obtained. In the parishes of Ludgvan and St. Just were at that time rich mines of copper and of tin, abounding with a great variety of curious minerals. These he collected, and e 2"], [66, "52 LUDGVAN, OR LUDGIAN. from that pursuit was led to study at large the natural his tory of this most interesting county. The numerous monuments of remote antiquity scattered over the hills and promontories of Cornwall, made also deep impressions on his mind, and he availed himself of every resource placed within his reach, by previous learn ing and erudition, to acquire a knowledge of the Druidical learning, and of the manners and customs of the ancient Britons previously to their becoming Christians. In 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1753 published in a folio volume, at Oxford, \" The Antiquities of Cornwall.\" A second edition in the same form came out at London in the year 1769, with considerable addi tions, under the following title : \" Antiquities, Historical and Monumental, of the County of Cornwall, consisting of several Essays on the ancient Inhabitants, Druid Supersti tion, Customs, and Remains of the most remote Antiquity in Britain and the British Isles: exemplified and proved by Monuments now extant in Cornwall and the Scilly Is lands: with a Vocabulary of the Cornu-British language. Revised, with several additions, by the Author.\" His next publication had for its title, \" Observations on the ancient and present state of the Islands of Scilly, and their importance to the Trade of Great Britain,\" Oxford, 1756, 4to. This work was an extension of a paper, read before the Royal Society in 1753. In 1758 came out his \" Natural History of Cornwall, with Engravings of all the specimens, both animate and mineral, deemed to be of curiosity or of importance,\" printed also at Oxford, in one volume folio, the original specimens and many antiquities being deposited in the Ashmolean Museum. All these works, executed with great ability, patient dili gence, and skill, raised the reputation of the author so high throughout the learned world, that in March 1766, the University of Oxford conferred on him their highest honour, the degree of Doctor by diploma, which he lived to"], [67, "53 LUDGVAN, OR LUDGIAN. \u25a0enjoy somewhat more than six years, having departed this life on the 3lst of August, 1772. Besides his literary correspondence with various learned men, he carried on one of peculiar frequency with the great poet of his age, Mr. Alexander Pope, and a large collection of Mr. Pope's letters to him is still extant, with a variety of other papers, obviously intended for publica tion. Dr. Borlase furnished Mr. Pope with many Cornish fos sils to decorate his celebrated grotto at Twickenham, where the donor's name was scored in capitals of the most splen did materials ; and in a letter written on the occasion, Mr. Pope says, \" I am much obliged to you for your valuable collection of Cornish diamonds. I have placed them where they may best represent yourself, in a shade, but shining.\" The Royal Society is indebted to Dr. Borlase for about twenty different communications, and in addition to all these labours, he for several years undertook the care of some private pupils, and had together under his roof the heirs of the principal families in the neighbourhood, Haw kins, St. Aubyn, and Vyvyan. A plain stone has been laid over his remains in Ludgven Church, with an inscription rendered almost illegible in the short period of sixty years. The monument of some distinguished person bears an inscription ending with these words : Commemorat h\u00e6c tabula brevi et ipsa interitura.

He mar ried Miss Alice Dewen of Marazion, but died without a family. The other son was rector of St. Mewan, and his grand son is now in possession of the family estates, not one of the numerous sons of Dr. Walter Borlase having left a male heir. Since the decease of Dr. William Borlase, two perma nent rectors have alone held the church up to the last year 1834, Mr. Herbert Praed, second son of Mr. Humphry Mackworth Praed of Trevethow, and Mr. John Stephens of Tregenna; but their relative situations, in regard to the in dividuals possessing the right of presentation, have induced many to conjecture that this power may have been exer cised from considerations not strictly conformable to those in contemplation when advowsons were entrusted to pri vate hands. Mr. Stephens is succeeded by the Rev. Henry Elliot Graham ; a relation or connection of the gentleman now representing the Powlet family. The chief proprietor of land in this parish is the Rev. John Rogers of Penrose, canon residentiary of Exeter. Mr. Gregar of Trewarthenick has also some farms; and as leasehold proprietors, the family of Curnow have been ancient residents.

The northern corner of this parish is situated on gra nite, resembling that of Gulval in every respect, except as"], [69, "55 LUDGVAN, OR LUDGIAN. to one variety .abounding in mica. Much of this stone may be seen in the more ancient houses at Penzance. The spot, however, from whence this stone was procured, is no longer known. A difference of opinion is indeed enter tained as to whether it was gotten from blocks near the surface, or from a bed that has been exhausted ; but all are agreed as to the district from whence it came ; and it is universally known by the name of Ludgvan stone. The property of cleaving evenly into regular blocks, eminently possessed by this species of granite, makes it valuable for building purposes ; and this property is clearly derived from the even arrangement of the scale of mica in which it abounds. Between the granite and the sea-shore a considerable portion of the schistose rocks is covered by a marsh, and by banks of sand. These rocks are made up of compact fel spar, sometimes nearly pure, at others intimately united with hornblend or actynolite; they are traversed by courses or dykes of felspar porphyry, as may be seen on the sea shore. LUXILIAN, or LUXULIAN. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Luxilian is in the hundred of Powder, and hath to the west St. Roche and St. Anstell, to the north Lanivet, to the east Lanlivery, to the south St. Blasey and Tyward reth. The right name of this parish is Lan Julian, the church of Saint Julian ; but although the church was originally dedicated to him, it has since changed its patron, and be longs to St. Ayre."], [70, "56 LUXILIAN, OR LUXULIAN. It is a vicarage, valued in the King's books at 10/. The patronage in Sir Nicholas Trevanion and Mrs. Carverth, now married to Mr. Cole, the present incumbent, whose father was incumbent before him. This church was valued, if at all in the taxation of Pope Nicholas, together with that of Lanlivery, both being then appropriated to the priory of Tywardreth. I shall begin with the principal as well as the most westerly estate in it, THE MANOR OF PRIDEAUX. This some would derive from a French original, as being pres d'eaux, near the waters ; for that the sea formerly flowed up as high as this place, till the stream works choaked up its entrance, any one that views the high cliff's under this place, and those on the opposite side of the val ley in Tywardreath, must needs be convinced of. And this leads me to another etymology for it, and as suitable to its situation, from Pir or Prid, clay, and Aus, the same with Als, the cliff or sea-shore. But be this how it will, Prideaux Castle herein was for several ages (probably before the Norman Conquest) the seat of, and gave name to a family which hath been very eminent both in this county and in Devonshire, and still flourisheth in both. Thomas de Prideaux represented this county in the Parliament 26 Edward I. and Roger de Pri deaux was Sheriff of Cornwall 15 Edward III. His father Dominus Thomas Prideaux de Prideaux, was one of those who had in the 25th of Edward I. 201. per annum or more, in lands or rents in this county, which he held by knight's service. This family gave for their arms, Party per pale Azure and Gules, three castles Counterchanged ; which arms are now quartered by Mr. Prideaux of Padstow, who is descended, as well as all of the name, from younger branches of the family residing here."], [71, "LUXILIAN, OR LUXULIAN. 57 THE EDITOR. There does not seem to be any thing connected with the remaining property of this parish that is important or cu rious. The chief landholders are the Rashleigh family, and Mrs. Agar, representative of the Robertses. Mr. Coleman Rashleigh, son of Mr. John Rashleigh of Penquite, a younger brother from Menabilly, has pur chased Prideaux, built there an excellent modern house, and restored the place, although in a different style, to its ancient splendour. This gentleman has distinguished him self as one of the most active, most able, and most energetic among those who have supported in Cornwall the theories leading to recent organic change in the system of our repre sentation, and he has been created a Baronet by the Reform administration. The church is situated on very lofty ground, amidst granite rocks, so universally scattered over the surface, that many houses are built hi such a manner as to make one or more of these rocks available in the walls. Yet the soil is good ; and Mr. Grylls, the present vicar, has proved that taste and per severance may create an elegant assemblage of whatever is useful or ornamental in a situation apparently the most unpromising. The tower as well as the church far exceed the average in size and beauty. The tower has a singular addition of a small room at the top ; and in this room va rious records relating to the Stannaries and to the Duchy of Cornwall are said to have been preserved, while the armies on both sides, in the civil war, were ravaging the country, and destroying the towns. Mr. Tonkin has remarked on the romantic and beauti ful vale which descends from Luxilian Church by Prideaux to St. Blazey Bridge, and in explaining the phenomena of lofty and precipitous inland cliffs, he has anticipated the most recent theories of modern geology.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. This parish stretches north and south across the large patch of granite, which is situated between Bodmin and St. Austell, and also extends over the slate at its northern and southern extremities. The extent of surface covered by the northern slate is more than a square mile ; but the southern slate forms only a small triangle north and north east of St. Blazey Bridge. The northern half of this pa rish corresponds with the parish of St. Dennis in the na ture of its rocks; the southern half with St. Austell and St. Blazey The most interesting feature of this parish, in a geological point of view, consists of its numerous and ex tensive stream-works. This part of Cornwall, including the adjoining parishes, has long been celebrated for the fine quality of its stream-tin, which is, as to the greater part, either crystalline, or of the kind denominated wood tin, on account of its fibrous texture. The gravel con taining this stream-tin rests on the rock, or on its untrans ported debris ; above this occurs a regular stratum of de cayed trees and plants; in the deepest stream-works these are covered by another bed of gravel containing tin, hav ing also a superincumbent layer of decayed trees and plants : but this second stratum of tin, always less in quan tity than the first, is seldom of sufficient value to p.ay for the labour of separation. Over all occurs a layer of uncer tain thickness, composed of the debris of adjacent rocks, and sustaining on its surface a coating of recent vegetable, and forming marshy, arable, or meadow land, according to the accidental situation of the spot."], [73, "59 MARE THE EDITOR. The greater part of the valleys in Cornwall having been long since streamed, exhibit little else than heaps of un sightly rubbish: instead of displaying, as in other districts, the most pleasing features of a country. The late Mr. Humphrey Mackworth Praed has, however, proved in the case of a valley at Lelant, that such deformities may be removed, and the meadows restored to their natural beauty, accompanied even by pecuniary advantage to the pro prietor. But such improvements are greatly obstructed by an anomalous property called the right of bounds. MABE. HALS. Mabe, a vicarage, is situated in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the north Stithians, and west Constantine ; east, part of Gluvias and Bradock. For the name, it is plain Cornish Mab or Mabe, being a son, and in this place either to be construed in reference to Milorus (son of Melianus, King or Duke of Cornwall), who lies buried in Milor church-yard, and who was lord of this place, or had some jurisdiction over it, as Milor church at this day hath in spirituals over Mabe, to which it is considered as annexed. Or perhaps the name of this church, Mab or Mabe, refers to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whose honour it may have been erected by our ancestors as a pledge of their orthodox faith, in opposition to the Ebio rite and Arian heresies. At the time of the Norman conquest the district was"], [74, "60 MABE taxed under the jurisdiction of Tremiloret, i. e. Milor's Town.

In this place, at Tremough, is the dwelling of John Worth, Esq. sheriff of Cornwall 10th of Queen Ann, who married Trefusis, his father Penularick ; originally de scended from the Worths of Worth, in Devon or Somer set ; who giveth for his arms, in a field Ermine, an imperial eagle with two necks Sable, armed Gules. Tre-mayne in this parish, i. e. the town of stone, or the stone town, transnominated the gentle family of Peares or Perys, i. e. Pearce in English, to that of Tre mayne, tempore Edward III. at which time Peres de Tre mayne was lord and possessor thereof, who married Dame Opre, or Obre de Treskewis, and by her had issue John, that died without issue ; 2ndly, Peros, that married Onera Trevartea, by whom he had issue Richard, who had issue Thomas, that married Isabella, daughter and heir of Tren chard of Collacomb in Devon, and removed thither, by whom he had issue Nicholas, Canon of St. Peter's Churcb, Exeter ; which Isabella, surviving her husband Tremayne, married Sir John Damerell, Knight, sheriff of Devon 1 Richard II. 1377, by whom she had no issue: never theless so prevailed with him, having no issue of his own, to settle divers land upon her issue by Tremayne, which was a great advancement of the estate of the Tremaynes. In 1392, Nicholas her son aforesaid married Jane, and had issue Thomas that married Carew, who had issue John, who by Joan Warr had issue John, who had issue Tho-"], [75, "61 MABE mas, who by Grenville had issue Roger, Edmund, and De gory; Degory had issue Arthur, that married Grenville, by whom he had issue Edmund and Richard, from which Richard the Tremaynes of St. Ewe are descended.

The name of this parish in the king's book is La Vabe, that is, St. Vabe, or Mabe's Place. The chief estate in this parish, and which I shall there fore begin with, is the manor of Carnsew, alias, says Mr. Carew, Carndew, the black rock, or rather a heap of black rocks, this parish and estate abounding in great rocks of moorstone. This place gave name to a very emi nent family, which removed afterwards to Bokelby in St. Kew. One of the Carnsews of Bokelby granted a lease of the barton of Carnsew, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to William Thomas, which William Thomas from thence forth took the name of Carnsew ; and I have in my posses sion a grant of arms from Sir Richard St. George, Cla renceux King-at-Arms, to Henry Carnsew, of Trewone, junior, dated the 2d of December 1633, recognising this assumption of a new name from his place of residence. This family has since removed to a better settlement at Trewoon in Budock. Carverth, which signifies the green town, is also within and held from this manor. This place gave name to, and was the seat of an ancient race of gentlemen, from whom it passed to the Penalunas, till, in the reign of King Charles the First, it was sold to Thomas Melhuish of Penryn, mer-"], [76, "62 MABE chant, descended from the Melhuishes of Northan in Devonshire. Tremogh, that is, the dwelling or town of hogs, is also held from this manor, and was likewise formerly the seat of a family of the same name, from whom it came to the fa mily of Blois of Penryn, in which name it continued till the year 1 703, when Roger and John Blois, two brothers, sold this barton, which is of considerable value, to John Worth, Esq. of Penryn, who had for some time before a considerable mortgage on it. Mr. Worth hath built on Tremogh a very large house of moorstone (granite), and hath inclosed a small park for deer. He hath been a justice of the peace during all the reign of Queen Anne, King George the First, and King George the Second ; and was sheriff of the county in the tenth year of Queen Anne. His father, Mr. William Worth, of Penryn, merchant, married Jane, one of the daughters and coheiresses of Pennalerick, by whom he had, among others, a second son, William Worth, D. D. now Archdeacon of Worcester. Mr. John Worth hath been some time a widower by the death of his wife Bridget, daughter of Francis Trefusis, of Trefusis, Esq. who has left him only one son, of the same name. Hantertavas is likewise held of this manor, which signi fieth the half tongue, but why I know not. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has been singularly unfortunate in his etymo logy of Tremogh, which has therefore been omitted. With out all doubt, it means, as Mr. Tonkin has interpreted, the hog or pig's town ; and the street leading to Tremogh from Penryn is now called Pig's Street. The heiress of the Wrorth family married an adventurer of the name of Ha milton, who ruined all his affairs by contested elections and extravagances. Tremogh was sold about the year 1775 ; and"], [77, ".MABE 63 having passed into the hands of persons of a nearly similar description, the house remained shut up till the wood de cayed, and the place was disfigured by the sale and removal of all the trees. The property has, however, at last been secured by a respectable gentleman, who resides on the spot, has renovated the house, and commenced plantin<r and other decorations. The most discriminating feature of this parish and of the immediate neighbourhood, is the great abundance of granite, not merely in large blocks, the proper moorstone, but in regular and extensive quarries; aud so great has been the exportation of this most valuable material, that almost the whole of Waterloo Bridge, and much of the interior of London Bridge, are constructed of stone car ried to the Thames from Falmouth harbour. Districts abounding in crystalline rocks are usually un even, and in this parish the main road, leading from Hel ston and all the west to Penryn and Falmouth, had to descend Mabe-hill; but in this year (1835) the line has been turned from the south of Tremogh to a vale on the northern side, which reduces the upper level, and converts a precipitous descent into one sufficiently sloped for car riages of every description. Tbe old road has, however, still an attraction for botanists, as the antirrhinum monspessu lanum, a plant very rarely found in other situations, grows there abundantly on the banks and hedges. Mr. Tonkin is mistaken in tracing the family of Tre mayne, long settled at Heligan, in St. Ewe, from the barton in this parish. That family is unquestionably derived from Tremayne in St. Martin's, on the Helford river. Mabe measures 2029 statute acres.

One corner of this parish, immediately north of Penryn, extends on the slate in the form of a very narrow and short stripe; but all the remainder rests entirely on granite, which is for the most part coarse-grained and crystalline, abounding in porphyritic crystals and felspar. It, how ever, also contains numerous beds of a finer quality, which being well-adapted for building is extensively quarried. ST. MABEN, or ST. MABIN. HALS.

But nothing has in modern times so much distinguished O \"***, this parish as the residence of its learned rector, the Rev. Charles Peters. Mr. Peters' reputation for a most profound acquaintance with oriental literature, is sufficiently established by a con troversy with the mighty man of his time, Doctor William Warburton ; but there is also a traditional history of his benevolence, of his piety, and of his genuine simplicity, so interesting that the Editor has most gladly availed himsell of a communication from persons nearly connected with this great and good man, to insert it here. \" The Rev. Charles Peters, of St. Mabyn, was de scended from a merchant of Antwerp, who fled to England from the persecution of the Protestants in Germany. His grandson was a Turkey merchant of Fowey in the time of Queen Elizabeth : this gentleman was father of the famous Hugh Peters, and his mother was a Treffry, of Place-house. \" The ancestor of Mr. Peters of St. Mabyn was a roy- alist. The Rev. Charles Peters was born on the 1st of December 1690. In Tregony, at the German school there, he was taught Latin and Greek, and the first rudi- ments of Hebrew. He was afterwards of Exeter College, Oxford. When first ordained he served the curacy of St. Just in Roseland ; then was presented with the living of Boconnock. In 1723 the living of Bralton Clovelly was given to him, and three years afterwards St. Mabyn, where from that time he chiefly resided, but spent a part of each year at Bralton, keeping a curate at each. Every Sunday he entertained a great number of the poorest of his parishioners; and on Monday the remaining meat was dis tributed to them, with bread for each; and thus in succes sion he entertained all the poor of the parish ; and there was scarcely any poor rate in St. Mabyn during his life. \" He .spent a large portion of his income in relieving the f 2"], [82, "68 ST. MABEN. temporal wants of his fellow-creatures, and much of his time in their spiritual instruction. Besides morning and evening prayers, he read the Bible daily to his family, and also daily studied it himself in the original languages. \" When he published his Dissertation on the Book of Job, and drew on himself the insolence of Warburton, he bore it with the most perfect Christian charity. \" He had written a vindication of Homer in answer to Warburton. Before it was published W'arburton had be come a Bishop, when, fearing that the faults of the man might reflect on the sacred order, he abstained from pub lishing it, saying, ' Thou shalt not speak evil of the rulers of thy people.' Mr. Peters was of abstemious habits, regu lar both in his studies and his exercise, which the natural delicacy of his constitution required. He never married, but educated the two eldest sons of his elder brother, Dr. Joseph Peters, M. D. of Truro, and the Rev. Jona than Peters, of St. Clement's. The latter was bred to the church at his desire, and continued with him as his curate, till the living of St. Clement called the nephew to the cure of his own church. \" Mr. Peters lived to the age of eighty-four, retaining the full possession of his faculties to the last.\" Extracts from his Meditations in manuscript : \u2014 When speaking of Warburton, he says, \" Let me then go on with this work which I have begun. Let me beg the assistance of God, that I may do it in a proper manner, so as not to return evil for evil, or railing for railing, but to preserve my temper, and to consider what the Dean has said, in a cool dispassionate way if possible ; or at least to check my pen so as to say nothing that may misbecome me either as a Christian or a clergyman. \"As to what relates to Dean Warburton, he has freed me, I think, from all manner of obligation to say anything in complaisance; for this, considering the usage he has given me, would look like stooping to him, and distrusting the cause I have to plead for. I must keep up my spirits"], [83, "69 ST. MABEN. then, but beware of transgressing the rules of charity, of prudence, or of good manners. \" If it be necessary that I should publish the remainder of the Reply to the author of the Divine Legation, grant, oh Lord ! that I may conduct it with all that decency and prudence, that strict regard to charity as well as truth, which may become a Christian and a minister of Christ ; that I may have a constant check upon myself with regard to every thing that may be either light and ludicrous, or bitter and sarcastic : if my antagonist has given but too much into this way of writing, the greater shame to him ; and the greater shame to me if I should not endeavour to avoid so palpable a fault.\" Under the influence of an opinion, or rather of a preju- dice similar to those of plenary inspiration, and an imma- culate preservation of the text, and unmindful that the Gospels themselves convey a large portion of their instruc- tion under the form of allegory or parable, Mr. Peters maintained the historical authenticity of the book of Job against Dr. Warburton, who argued in favour of the oppo- site and manifestly the correct hypothesis. Yet so accu- rate and so extensive were the Hebrew learning and the general erudition of this profound scholar, that he com- pletely worsted the most celebrated critic of his age, and drove him from a sober investigation of facts, of ancient opi- nions, or of the peculiar form aud nature of moral instruc- tion used by eastern nations at various and remote periods, into virulent and personal abuse. It is curious to observe that the Book of Job has not the most remote allusion to anything connected with the Jews, neither to their laws or their ritual, nor to their patriarchs, or to their leader and legislator. And it is more curious that in all the writings trans mitted to our time by this extraordinary people, from the Book of Genesis to the last prophecy antecedent to its Babylonish captivity, not the slightest reference is made to a state of future existence ; unless the strange narrative"], [84, "70 ST. MABEN. respecting the Witch of Endor should be deemed an excep tion, suspected as it is of interpolation; and at all events utterly unfitted for announcing, and that too incidentally, the most important of revealed truths. Previously, more over, to the captivity, no personification is ever mentioned of the Principle of Evil. \u2014 \" Now the serpent was more sub tile than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made ; and he said unto the woman,\" &c. No allusion is here made to any supernatural being; nor did the serpent lose the disgraceful credit till three thousand five hundred years after the fact, of having by his own unassisted subtilty, ma levolence, and craft, led our first parents into the fatal snare predestined to work the utter and eternal destruc tion of countless millions of the human race, but for the stupendous mystery of their subsequent redemption. In the Book of Job reference is made to a future life ; and the Principle of Evil not only appears as a distinct person age, but is placed in collision and in debate with the Prin ciple of all Good, driving the Divinity itself to the clumsy expedient, suited only to the imperfections of a finite intel lect, of ascertaining by an actual experiment, whether a man were capable of sustaining certain degrees of bodily pain and of mental affliction, without murmuring against his Creator, the Lord and Giver of life, in whom we live, and move, and have our beino*. It seems plain, therefore, from the doctrine of a future state first noticed in this work, from the first introduction of a being hostile to the happiness of all others and delight ing in their misery, and from the absence of any allusion to a single fact connected with the Mosaic dispensation, or to the history embodied in the Sacred Records ; and, lastly, from the dramatic form of the whole ; that the Book of Job must be a parable, a moral tale, a poem wholly uncon nected with the Jewish faith. It seems not to be improbable that such a composition, teaching the important duties of resignation and submission to the Divine will,"], [85, "71 ST. MABEN.

And a work so excellent, so abounding in the most sublime and elevated flights of eastern poetry, soaring towards such topics as even that poetry is unable fully to reach, may well have been added by Ezra to the Book of the Law which he brought before the congregation, and read before them in the street, when they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground. The Editor has also been desirous of obtaining informa tion respecting another member of this family, whom, at the distance of almost two centuries from those times of vio lence and of civil commotion in which he lived, we may now consider as one persecuted in his death and in his fame, far beyond the degree which any demerit on his part, either as a fanatic in religion or as a partizan in politics, could have justly merited. He was probably selected as a victim by his opponents to gratify the base passions of an ignorant multitude, now anxious to destroy those whom they had previously adored ; and ridicule was cast on his memory by the triumphant party, as an expedient for beating down religious opinions hostile to the system of ecclesiastical government then re established : perhaps also, the possession of Lambeth Palace, like that of the house adjoining the capitol by Manlius, may have excited similar feelings ; and possibly he was considered in some degree as an equivalent for Laud. Extract from a History written in 1781 : \u2014 \" William, Thomas, and Hugh Peters were brothers, and born at Fowey in Cornwall. Their father was a mer chant of large property, and their mother was Elizabeth"], [86, "72 ST. MABEN. Treffry, daughter of John Treffry, Esq. of a very ancient and opulent family in that town. \" William received his education at Leyden, Thomas at Oxford, and Hugh at Cambridge. Between the years 1610 and 1620 Thomas and Hugh became clergymen in London. William continued a private gentleman. About the. year 1628 Thomas and Hugh having rendered them selves obnoxious by their popularity and puritanic preaching, were silenced by the Bishop. They then went to Holland and remained till 1633, when they returned to London. The three brothers then sold their landed property, and in the following year embarked for America. Hugh settled at Salem, and soon became so popular as to excite the jea lousy of those who had previously swayed the fanatical opinions of that place. Mr. Hugh Peters was in a short time appointed a trustee of the college at New Cambridge. He built a grand house, and purchased a large tract of land. The yard before his house he paved with flint-stones from England ; and having dug a well he paved that also with flint-stones, for the accommodation of every inhabitant in want of water. It bears the name of Peter's Spring up to the present time. \"He here married a second time, and had one daughter named Elizabeth. His renown as a zealot increasing, he received an invitation to remove from Salem to Boston, with which he complied, and there laid the foundation stone of the great meeting-house, of which the Reverend Doctor Samuel Cooper, one of the most learned literati in America, is the pastor. Those whose envy he had excited at Salem, ill brooked being thus outrivalled by Mr. Peters. Yet finding him an orthodox fanatic, and more powerful than themselves, they seemingly bowed to his superiority, at the same time that they were contriving a plan which ended in his destruction. \" In 1641 they conspired with the civil authorities of Bos ton to convert their leading priest into a politician, by ap pointing him agent to Great Britain. The plot succeeded,"], [87, "73 ST. MABEN. and Mr. Hugh Peters assumed his agency under colour of petitioning for some abatement of customs and excise ; but his real commission was to foment the civil discontents, wars, and jars then prevailing between the King and the Parliament. He did not see into the motives of these peo ple ; and he felt a strong inclination to chastise the Court and the Bishop of London, who had turned him out of the church for his fanatical conduct. \" On Mr. Peters 's arrival in London, the Parliament took him into their service. The Earls of Warwick and of Essex were also his patrons. In 1644 the Parliament gave him Archbishop Laud's library, and soon afterwards made him head of the Archbishop's court, and gave him the estate and palace at Lambeth ; all which he kept till the Restoration. \" The people of Boston conducted themselves with in gratitude and neglect towards Mr. Peters ; they never paid him any part of the stipend attached to his office, although he discharged the duties of it during twenty years, and ob tained from the Protector a charter for the Society for pro pagating the Gospel in New England, which, by contribu tions raised in Great Britain, has supported all the mis sionaries among the Indians to the present time. \" An occurrence at the melancholy close of Mr. Peters's life evinces his firmness of mind and self-possession. \" The sentences of our law, now barbarous in words alone, were in those days executed with horrors so savage, as to forbid description. The scenes of cruelty were repeated one after the other; and in his own case Mr. Peters, either from design or accident, remained to witness on others the inflictions which awaited himself. At that moment an offi cer whose heart must have been more obdurate than the hardest flint, or than Marpewan rock, inquired of him how he liked the proceeding, and received for answer, ' Friend, thou doest ill to dist\u00a5*ss. a dying man !

In the church and churchyard are monuments to various distinguished families resident within the parish : Borlase, NichoUs, Arundell, Harris, Pearce, Jenkin, Heckens, Clies, Pascoe, &c. ; and some in memory of strangers, who too long delayed availing themselves of the mild climate and salubrious air of the M ount's Bay. One of the more ancient monuments has these lines : Belgium me birth, Britaine me breeding gave, Cornwall a wife, ten children, and a grave. Castle Horneck is thought to be the site of a castle deno- g 2"], [98, "84 MADDERN. minated Hornec, or iron, from its supposed strength, and built by the Tyers, who were lords of this district early in the times of the Plantagenets. This place was the residence during a long life, of the Rev. Walter Borlase, Doctor of Civil Law, Vice- Warden of the Stannaries, and Vicar of Maddern for more than fifty-five years, who died April 26, 1776, aged 81 years and six months. Doctor Borlase appears to have been universally re spected, as a man of ability .and learning, and for firmness and decision of character. He was the eldest son of Mr. John Borlase, of Pendeen in St. Just, sometime Member of Parliament for St. Ives, and brother of the Rev. Wil liam Borlase, also Doctor of Civil Law, and Rector of Ludgvan, our justly celebrated historian. Doctor Walter Borlase married Margaret, daughter of the Rev. Henry Pendarves, vicar of the adjoining parish of Paul: and he is said in consequence of this marriage to have quitted the law, in which profession he could scarcely have failed of attaining some considerable distinction. They had a very numerous family of sons and daughters ; but, none of the sons having left a son, the family estate has passed, under an entail, to the descendants of Doctor William Borlase, and now belongs to his great-grandson. Doctor WTalter Borlase built the house at Castle Horneck. The family arms are, Ermine, on a bend Sable, two hands issuing at the elbows from as many clouds Proper, and rending a horseshoe Or. Trereife has been long the residence of the Nicholls's, of whom the most distinguished person was Frank NichoUs, M.D. Physician to King George the Second, and son-in law of the celebrated Dr. Mead. His life has been written in Latin by Dr. Lawrence, sometime President of the College of Physicians, with his portrait. It appears from this work that Dr. NichoUs was born in 1699, that he be came a member of Exeter College, Oxford, in March 1714 took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1729, and was"], [99, "85 MADDERN. chosen a Fellow of the College of Physicians in the follow ing year, being previously a Fellow of the Royal Society. Nine different communications from Doctor NichoUs are printed in the Philosophical Transactions, and he pub lished a separate work: \" De Anima Medica,\" to which is added a treatise, \" De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Ho mine Nato et non Nato.1' His reputation stands deservedly very high as an Anato mist. Several dissections of the viper's head and poisonous fangs, engraved for Dr. Mead's work, are believed to be his; and to him is attributed the invention of what are termed corroded preparations. He died in January 1778, having completed his 79th year. This gentleman's elder brother married in London, but finally settled at Trereife, with one son and two daughters. The two daughters married, the eldest Mr. Love of Pen- zance, the second William Harris, of Kenegie, Esq. but neither left any family. The son, William NichoUs, mar- ried Miss Ustick, of Penzance, and died leaving one son. Mrs. NichoUs subsequently married the Rev. Charles Va- lentine Le Grice, of Bury St. Edmunds, then Lecturer of Penzance, and bore him a son, who, together with Mr. Le Grice, now hold the estate as tenants in remainder, and by the courtesy, under the will of Mr. NichoUs, Jun. who lived to the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. Trengwainton appears to have been inhabited by branches of\" the Arundell family, for a long series of years, and finally the last Mr. Arundell, of Menadarva, removed there, hav- ing in a great measure rebuilt the house. Soon after his decease it was sold, and Mr. Praed, of Trevethow, became the purchaser. Trengwainton was thus chiefly used as a farm-house till the late Sir Rose Price, wishing to form a seat in that neighbourhood, obtained it as an accommoda tion from the late Mr. Praed, and under his hands it has become a splendid residence. It appears that a gentleman of the name of Price accom panied Venables and Penn in their successful expedition"], [100, "86 MADDERN. against Jamaica, during the Protectorate, and obtained an extensive grant of land, which his descendants lived on and improved, till early in the last century one of the sons was sent to England for education and health. It is under stood that Doctor NichoUs was consulted as a physician, and that he recommended the climate of Penzance ; per haps Mr. John Price may have been the first invalid ever sent from a distance to breathe the soft air of this all but island in the Atlantic. At that time Mr. Henry Badcock, from the parish of Whilstone, in the north-eastern extre mity of Cornwall, held the office of Collector at Penzance, where he had married Parthenia Keigwin, daughter of Mr. John Keigwin, of Mousehole. The young patient was re ceived into their house by Mr. and Mrs. Badcock, who had several daughters. Mr. Price married in the year 1736 Margery, one of their daughters; but having gone back to Jamaica he died there three years afterwards, leaving her with an only son, also John Price. This gentleman, having gone through the usual stages of education, ending with Trinity College, Oxford, went also to Jamaica, and there married Elizabeth Williams Bramer, daughter of John Bramer, a physician. They had only one son, who lived to a mature age, and succeeded his father in January 1797. Mr. Rose Price, in the subsequent year, married Miss Elizabeth Lambert, a young lady from the county of Meath, born on the 12th of April 1782, by a singular coin cidence on the very day that Admiral Rodney's victory saved Jamaica from being captured by the French, and therefore about sixteen at the time of her marriage. Mr. Price served the office of Sheriff for Cornwall in the year 1814, as his father had done forty years before, in the year 1774. In this year also he was made a Baronet, in conse quence of a promise from King George the Fourth, then Regent. Lady Price died early in life, leaving a large family; and"], [101, "87 MADDERN. Sir Rose Price died on the 29th September 1834, having nearly completed his 65th year. And here I would add a few lines to commemorate a gentleman whose progress through life was mainly guided by his connexion with this family, and whose conduct re flects credit on them for their choice. In compliance with a custom evidently derived from the Catholic times of our forefathers, when every thing relating to the church was transacted in the language of ancient Rome, all boys whose parents were raised above the lowest state in society, went for six or twelve months to a Latin school. Mr. John Vinicombe was among the number, but his progress exhibited so great a superiority above other scholars of his age, that Mr. Perkin, the Lecturer and schoolmaster, prevailed on his father to allow of his staying an additional year. Just at that moment Mr. John Price placed his son at the same school ; and, at the suggestion probably of Mr. Perkin, Mr. Price was induced to pur chase at some small premium a further continuance of Mr. Vinicombe at the school, that he might assist, instruct, and be in some degree the companion of Mr. Rose Price. A connexion thus formed naturally went on; Mr. Vini- combe became a member of Pembroke College, Oxford, where he obtained a Fellowship; attended Mr. Rose Price to the school at Harrow, and acted as his private tutor when he became a gentleman commoner of Magdalen; made with him the tour of Europe; and finally, attended his friend and former pupil to Jamaica, where, by a resi- dence of .about two years, they nearly doubled the value of the estate. Soon after their return to England Mr. Vini- combe went to his Fellowship, and became not only a college tutor but one of the Public Examiners, under the then recent statute, and he had confident expectations of preferment in the church ; but a premature death termi nated his useful and honourable career, occasioned (or hastened at least) by a fall from his horse. An excellent"], [102, "88 MADDERN. picture of Mr. Vinicombe, by Mr. Opie, has gone to Pem broke College, under the will of Sir Rose Price. Rosecadgwell has been for a considerable time in the family of Borlase. Mr. John Borlase, father of the two Doctor Borlases, removed there from Pendeen in the latter portion of his life ; and Samuel Borlase, Esq. representa tive of this ancient and respectable family, resides there at present. Nanceolvern almost adjoins Rosecadgwell. This was the residence of Mr. Carverth. After building there an excellent house, Mr. Carverth died in very embarrassed circumstances, which gave rise to an unusual extent of litigation. This place, however, was purchased by one of the Mr. Urlicks, and it now belongs to Mr. Scobell, who married the heiress of that branch of the family. Poltare has a large and decorated house, built by the late Mr. Richard Heckens, of St. Ives, who married one of the daughters and coheiresses of Mr. George Veale. That place has passed by purchase also to the Scobell family. Trenear was formerly a seat of the Olivers. The last of this family, Doctor William Oliver, a physician, died at Bath in 1764 ; and another William Oliver, M.D. had the honour of accompanying King William in the expedition which placed him on the throne, to preserve the civil and religious liberties of England. Trenear was sold soon after the younger Dr. Oliver's decease, and purchased by Mr. Robyns, who built there a good house, and made it a gentleman's seat. It afterwards became the property and residence of the Rev. Anthony Williams, sometime Vicar of St. Kevern, and it has passed with one of his daughters and coheiresses to Henry Pendarves Tremenheere, Esq. late Captain of one among the first-rate ships in the East India Company's Service, where he merited and obtained the approbation, esteem, and respect of every individual with whom he had the slightest connexion, and the same effects of honour, ability, and kindness of heart, have fol lowed him into retirement."], [103, "89 MADDERN. Rose Hill has a good house, built about the commence ment of this century by Richard Oxnam, Esq. who served the office of Sheriff in the year 1810. It has since become the property and residence of the Rev. Uriah Tonkin, re cently appointed Vicar of Lelant. Lariggan is remarkable for the beauty of its situation ; having been selected, and a neat house built there, by Mr. Thomas Pascoe, a worthy and respectable magistrate. And just above the town of Penzance stands a house having almost the appearance of a palace, built some years since by an individual of the name of Pope. Mr. Pope was originally from Camelford ; he conducted business for some time at Bristol, and then emigrated to the United States, where he accumulated a large fortune, unknown and forgotten by his family ; till on a sudden he appeared at Penzance, recognised some relations, and, having purchased a few acres of ground, he built this mag nificent house, which instantly became known by general acclamation as the Vatican, a name suited at once to its splendour, to its elevated situation, and to its founder's name. Mr. Pope scarcely lived to inhabit this mansion; but left it to his nephew Mr. Vibert, to whose patriotism, skill, and perseverance, as a member of the corporation, Pen zance is mainly indebted for several of its improvements, and especially for its new church. The house is now inhabited by Mrs. Rogers, widow of the late Mr. John Rogers, of Penrose, near Helston, and her daughters. Lanyon was in former times the residence of one branch of the ancient and respectable family bearing that name. It now belongs to Mr. Rashleigh, of Menabelly ; the farm, however, possesses one of those monuments in comparison with which all family records are modern. In a croft near the side of the road leading from Pen zance towards Morva, stands the Cromleigh or Coit de scribed by Doctor Borlase, in pp. 230, 231, of his Antiqui ties, 2d edition. It fell down and has been replaced, (see the Logging Rock under St. Levan). Dr. Borlase men-"], [104, "90 MADDERN. tions another Cromleigh at Malfra, in this parish, and two others in the adjoining parishes of Morva and Zennor, all within a few miles of each other. These monuments, scat tered over a large portion of Europe, bear all the marks of great antiquity. Their construction is rude as well as simple, a flat but unhewn stone, laid on three columnar stones, also in their natural state, and all of Cyclopean di mensions. The flat stone at Lanyon has been estimated at twenty ton. Their use is much less certain. They are generally sup posed to be sepulchral monuments ; but the flat surface of the upper stone always inclined at a small angle from the horizon, would seem to countenance the opinion of their being meant for religious observances, probably for sacri fices, which is further countenanced by the etymology of the name, if it means in Celtic the Holy Hearth. Landithy, the college or preceptory of the Knights Tem plars, belonged for several generations to the Flemings, a family now quite extinct, and their property alienated. The great tithes of this parish belonged to the Knights Templars, under a gift from Henry de Pomeroy, one of the great family of the Pomeroys, Lords of Bury Pomeroy Castle. They were given by Henry the Eighth to some private person, and have belonged for a considerable time to the family of NichoUs, now Le Grice. The Vicarage has passed through other hands. It is related by Hals and Tonkin to have belonged to Flemino* and to Harris, and then by purchase to the corporation of Penzance, from which body it passed by sale to the family of Borlase, and is now vested in the heir-at-law, or in the devisee of the late Samuel Borlase, Esq. But at a remote period the baronial residence of an ex tensive lordship was at Alverton, held by the Pomeroys ; and Mr. Lysons says that it passed successively through the Tyes, Lisles, and Berkeleys, till reverting to the Crown it was granted to Whitmore and others, and has been di vided and subdivided. Scarcely a trace can be seen at Al-"], [105, "PENZANCE. 91 verton of its former magnificence. The portion still claim ing the nominal distinction of Manor of Al verton, Pen zance, and Mousehole, was bought of the Keigwins by the late Mr. George Veale, second son of Mr. Veale, of Tre vaila, who acquired a considerable fortune at Penzance by the practice of the law ; afterwards divided between his three daughters, \u2014 one married to Mr. Hickens, of Pol tair; another to Mr. Baines, a Captain in the Navy; and the third to Mr. Jenkin, an officer in the army. These ladies, or their families, have since disposed of Alverton, and the whole is now vested in James Halse, Esq, M. P. for St. Ives. Maddern Well is one of the numerous springs of water almost revered in former times on account of imputed su pernatural virtues ; and it has in reality, from time out of mind, diffused health and comfort over the thousands of persons inhabiting Penzance, the stream having been con ducted there by a winding channel of some miles in extent, and arriving at the highest part of the town, it is enabled to flow down to the sea through every street. Penzance, the most western market town in Corn wall, is one of the most flourishing. It appears to have been in former times no more than a small village, occu pying the promontory now distinguished as the Quay, where stood a chapel, dedicated to St. Anthony, the Patron of fishermen, which in all probability gave it the name of Pen-sance, or the holy head (land), and it seems further probable that the new church or chapel yard may have been an ancient fortress for the protection of the place. Houses however gradually extended beyond this narrow limit ; and the place had acquired some magnitude, when, in the year 1 595, on the 23d of July, a predatory squadron of ships from Spain, stood into the bay, and landing about two hundred men, destroyed Mousehole, burnt Paul Church, and did much injury to Penzance; see Carew, Lord Dun stanville's edition, p. 381. But, as appears from history to be very usual in such cases, the town arose with increased"], [106, "92 MADDERN. splendour from its ashes, and a charter of incorporation having been soon after, in 1614, granted by King James the First, measures were taken by this new body of trustees for insuring the increase and prosperity of the district com mitted to their charge. The most material of these were purchasing the seignorage of the harbour, and of the market, and of fairs, which according to the rude policy of former times had been vested in private persons, for indivi dual benefit ; the first of whom was Alice de Lisle, lady of the manor of Alverton, about the year 1332. The Corporation also acquired a piece of ground called the three-cornered spot, on which a spacious market house was constructed, and buildings proper for shops and for merchandize, were raised on the three faces of the triangle. Penzance acquired also the privilege of being a coinage town. From this period it continued gradually to increase in size, in wealth, and in consideration, notwithstanding some adverse events in the Civil War, till the progress re- ceived an almost unlooked-for acceleration by another effort of the faithful trustees for the place, the body corpo- rate. They, by a series of judicious efforts, continued for many years, at last completed a Pier, so extensive and well placed as to afford shelter for perhaps a hundred vessels, to admit several of the largest size used for traders, and to afford every accommodation and facility for the shipping or unshipping of merchandize. From the completion of this great work in 1813, up to the present period, Penzance has flourished beyond example ; and though much may be im- puted to the general prosperity of the times, and to the diffusion of knowledge, yet by far the greater part must be ascribed to the management of an unappropriated fund, by a body of honest and disinterested trustees, for the public benefit ; and the Editor is especially disposed to bear this testimony to one Corporation, at a period (1835) when all municipal bodies are about to be remodelled, on the alleged ground of their insufficiency for useful purposes. Penzance, for all ecclesiastical matters forming a part of"], [107, "93 PENZANCE. the parish of Maddern, has long had a chapel of ease, with a lecturer appointed for life by the corporation, oil an endowment made in 1680 by Mr. John Tremenheere, at that time a merchant residing in the town, and either the direct or collateral ancestor of the very respectable family of that name still remaining in the town and neighbour hood. It has since been augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty ; but, the chapel having become wholly inadequate to the population, a church has been built in its place, accompa nied by a lofty tower, and all constructed of granite, so as to add, in a most extraordinary degree, to the beauty of the town, and at the same time to afford every convenience that the space could possibly admit; and it is pleasing to add, that the work has been conducted and executed by all the parties concerned, in a manner highly creditable to their taste, to their judgment, and to their care in the expen diture of public money. But among the gentlemen who have exerted themselves in different ways, it would be un fair not particularly to mention Mr. Vibert, whose general skill, ability, and accurate knowledge of details have been most conspicuous throughout the whole undertaking ; and the Editor hopes that the ties of consanguinity will not be thought of a nature to preclude him from referring here to the late Mr. Edward Giddy, who, in the situation of chief magistrate, conferred on him, over and over again, in every other situation, on all occasions, and especially in regard to this splendid and useful building, proved himself the active, zealous, and intelligent friend of the town and of all its inhabitants; and it is further gratifying to state, that the existing' members of the family of Tremenheere, in emu lation of their ancestor, to whom the chapel is indebted for its original endowment, have added the splendid deco ration of painted glass over the whole east window of the chancel. The new church will be opened for divine ser vice in the present year ; and in this year also, as perhaps the last act of a select corporate body, which, in the"], [108, "94 PENZANCE. administration of an income little short in its gross amount of two thousand pounds a year, may challenge the most minute investigation, the town and neighbourhood will receive the benefit of a new, commodious, and ex tended market-house, with the usual appendages, fully ade quate to the still increasing opulence and commerce of the place. Penzance may justly be proud of the many distinguished families and individuals connected with it : Clive, Fleming, Borlase, Tremenheere, Tonkin, Veale, John, Pellew, Bat ten, Came, Davy, Boase, Colston, Giddy. It would re quire a volume to give even a slight history of each family, and of its individual members. The Tonkins were long represented by Mr. Uriah Ton- kin, who, through a life extended far beyond the period usually assigned to human nature, obtained universal re- gard and esteem. This gentleman had several sons; from one of whom is descended the Reverend Uriah Tonkin, now Vicar of Lelant. Another son, Mr. John Tonkin, pursued the practice of medicine till he succeeded to the family estate. He was distinguished for ability, good nature, and for quaint- ness of expressions in the form of apophthegms ; but the most remarkable incident in Mr. John Tonkin's life was his adoption of Humphry Davy, with the intention of edu- cating him to the medical profession, and making him his successor. Davy, having succeeded to a small fortune on the decease of his father, soared above the narrow limits of a country practitioner, and was preparing him- self for Edinburgh, when the Editor most fortunately directed his course to Clifton, where Dr. Beddoes was then engaged in applying pneumatic chemistry in aid of the Bristol waters for the cure or alleviation of incipient consumption ; from thence be fought his way to the pin nacle of honour attached to experimental science. Everything of importance in the life of this extraordi nary man has been given with accuracy and ability by Doc-"], [109, "PENZANCE. 95 tor Paris, in a Life of Davy, 1 vol 4to. or 2 vols. 8vo. Colburn and Bentley. 1831. The family of Batten have been for some time the lead ing merchants of Penzance. They have recently lost Mr. John Batten, distinguished by the intelligence and libe rality incident to gentlemen in that profession ; but he has left a family more than promising to support his reputa tion and the credit of his ample fortune; and this family has the honour of possessing the Reverend Joseph Hallett Batten, D.D. Principal of the East India College. This gentleman having been placed at Trinity College, Cambridge, by the Editor's recommendation, immediately distinguished himself in the public examinations and by obtaining college prizes; and on taking his degree Mr. Batten became Third Wrangler. These honours led at once to a Fellowship, and to the most desirable private tuitions ; and, having married, he was placed at the head of an institution destined to prepare the minds and the habits of young men for the government of a vast empire. Mr. William Carne came to Penzance about sixty years ago, where, by active and intelligent industry, he has ac quired an ample fortune. Of his son, Mr. Joseph Carne, it would not be an easy task to speak in terms sufficiently laudatory :\u2022 I therefore refer to his commnnications in the Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall, to his most ample and valuable collection of natural history, and to his patronage of every institution established for the diffusion of knowledge. The late Mr. Boase left Cornwall at an early age, and became the active partner in a London bank, from whence he returned to Penzance, and conferred important benefits on the town as a magistrate and member of the corpora tion, and by the judicious employment of his capital. His eldest son Dr. Henry S. Boase supports, as Se cretary, the Geological Society, instituted by Doctor Paris in the year 1814. Besides papers in these Transac tions, Dr. Boase has published, \" Primary Geology,\" a"], [110, "96 PENZANCE. separate work, in 1 vol. 8vo. Longman and Co. 1834. which has attracted the attention of natural philosophers throughout Europe ; and although this is not the place to express my individual gratitude, yet I may say, that the most valuable additions to Mr. Hals's and Mr. Tonkin's parochial histories will be found in Doctor Boase's geo logical description of each separate parish. I cannot omit here to notice, among the inhabitants who have done credit to Penzance, my late respected relation Mr. Thomas Giddy, as a gentleman, a scholar, and a man of unblemished reputation. He came to Penzance in the year 1774, was chosen Mayor ten different times, and in his last mayoralty mainly assisted in carrying into execution a great improvement of the town, by removing the Coinage Hall from a place adjoining the Market House, to a proper situation near the quay, permission for which the Editor had the good fortune to obtain from the Lord Warden and the Duchy Officers. Mr. Giddy died July the 26th, 1825, having nearly completed his eighty-fourth year, and having somewhat more than completed the sixtieth year of his marriage. His widow survived him about five years. Dr. Stephen Luke was also from Penzance. He prac tised with much success and reputation at Falmouth, Ex eter, and London, where he died on the 30th of March 1829. Finally, I may state that the intrepid and successful Admiral Pellew, although not a native of Penzance, re ceived his nautical education in this town. A grammar school has long been endowed by the Cor poration ; and the master used formerly to hold in addition the lecturership of the chapel. The Reverend James Parkin, afterwards Rector of Oke ford in Devonshire, held both offices for a considerable time ; and under his care, for about eighteen months, the Editor received the only instruction for which he is in debted to a stranger."], [111, "97 PENZANCE. The school is now presided over by the Reverend Mr. Morris, M.A. from Balliol College, Oxford; and Mr. Le- Grice having resigned the lecturership, after holding it above twenty years, has been succeeded by the Reverend Mr. Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. Penzance has become, in the last half century, a consi derable resort of invalids ; and much benefit has been re ceived in pulmonary cases from the mildness and compara tively even temperature of the climate, which has been most satisfactorily established by the observations of Mr. Ed ward Giddy, printed in the Journal of Philosophy. For a detailed account of Penzance and of the Mount's Bay, in a medical point of view, the reader is referred to the works of Dr. Paris, who resided some years in the town, till he left it to acquire one of the most extensive fields of prac tice in London. An event occurred at Penzance in the year 1760, of a nature so curious as to be well worthy of remembrance. This country was then deeply engaged in what has since been termed the seven years' war ; and, notwithstanding the splendid successes of 1759, the nation still felt alarm from the always threatened invasion by France, and from the fear of predatory excursions, when in the night follow- ing the 29th of September the town was roused by the firing of guns, and soon after by the intelligence of a large ship of a strange appearance having run on shore on the beach towards Newlyn. Great numbers of persons crowded to the spot, where they were still more astonished and shocked by the sight of men still stranger than their vessel, each armed with a scymetar and with pistols. It was now obvious that they were Moslems; and a vague fear of Turkish ferocity, of massacre and plunder, seised the unarmed inhabitants, just awakened from their sleep in the middle of the night. A volunteer company obeyed, however, with alacrity the beat to arms, and 172 men were conducted or driven into a spacious building which then stood on the Western Green, and for some reason or other VOL. III. H"], [112, "98 PENZANCE. was called the Folly. Eight men were found to be drowned. Before morning it was ascertained from them selves, by some who understood the lingua Franca, that the ship was an Algerine corsair, carrying 24 guns, from nine to six pounders, and that the Captain had steered his ves sel into the Mount's Bay, and run it against the shore under a full conviction that he was safe in the Atlantic Ocean, at about the latitude of Cadiz, thus committing an error of thirteen degrees in latitude. The instant it was known that the sailors were Algerines, a fear seized the town and neighbourhood scarcely less formidable than the other of massacre and plunder \u2014 namely, of the plague. The volunteers, however, kept watch and ward to prevent all intercourse. Intelligence was conveyed to the govern ment, and orders are said to have been issued for troops to march from Plymouth for surrounding the whole district ; but most fortunately the local authorities ascertained that no cause whatever existed for such a precaution, and the orders were countermanded. When it was found safe to visit the strangers, curiosity attracted the whole neighbourhood. Their Asiatic dress, long beards and mustachios, with turbans, the absence of all covering from their feet and legs, the dark complexion and harsh features of a piratical band, made them objects of terror and of surprise. They were on the whole treated kindly ; their vessel had totally disappeared, and consequently after some delay a ship of war took all the men on board, and conveyed them to Algiers. The tower of Penzance Church is situated in latitude 50\u00b0 6' 48\"; longitude 5\u00b0 31' 0\"; in time 22 m. 4 s. west of Greenwich, as deduced from the Trigonometrical Survey.

THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. A large portion of this parish is situated on granite, the boundary line of which extends from near the church, in a semicircular form, to Buryas Bridge. South of this line the parish consists of felspar, hornblend, and actynolite rocks, all of which occur both in massive and in schistose forms. A fine instance of the latter may be seen at the back of the quay at Penzance, and may be traced for some distance in a westerly direction on the sea shore below high-water mark. About halfway to Newlyn another bed of porphyry, or an irregular continuation of the former, was a few years since explored for tin, and became the cele brated Wherry Mine, yielding not only a large quantity of tin, so as to afford profit after paying the expenses of a h 2"], [114, "100 MADDERN. steam-engine, but also beautiful specimens of rare metallic minerals. For an account of this curious submarine mine, Mr. Hawkins' Paper in the Transactions of the Cornwall Geological Society, vol. 1, p. 127, may be consulted ; and in the third volume of the same work, p. 166, will be found an account of the sand bank and submarine finest existing near the same spot (by Dr. Boase. Ed.). Every part of this parish appears to be intersected with metalli ferous veins; some copper and small quantities of lead have been raised, but tin is the only metal that has yet proved of importance. To the above the Editor must add, that Penzance has the good fortune to possess a geological and mineralogical treasure peculiarly its own. In the year 1814 Doctor Paris and Mr. Ashurst Ma jendie began to institute the Geological Society, and to form a museum. The Society has flourished far beyond any expectation that could have been originally formed ; and the collection has been enriched by the liberality of Mr. Carne, Dr. Barham, Mr. Henwood, and others; but, above all, by Doctor Bottse, who has deposited specimens from all parts of Cornwall, collected on an actual survey extended to each individual parish. All these specimens are arranged, labelled, and numbered, with reference to their localities and to his admirable work. For the general arrangement of the cabinet, with in dexes, 8tc. the Society and the public are indebted to the ingenuity and industry of the late Mr. Edward Giddy; and the room of the Cornwall Geological Society at Pen zance may justly be pointed out to scientific strangers as the object most worthy of their attention throughout the whole extent of the country."], [115, "101 MAKER.

Part of Maker, and those lands called Mount Edgcumbe, were formerly the lands of Durneford of Devon, of which family, Stephen Durneford was Sheriff of Devon 6 Henry V. 1413, and of Cornwall 7 Henry V. 1419, whose great granddaughter, (the issue male failing) the sole heir of the family, was married to Sir Piers Edgcumbe, Knight, Lord of Cotehele in Cornwall by long inheritance, and of East Stonehouse in Devon, whose ancestor Peter Edgcumbe, Esq. 12 Flenry VI. 1443, was certified by the Commis- sioners to be one of the gentry of the county of Devon. He was the father of Richard Edgcumbe, afterwards knighted, Sheriff of Devon 2d Henry VII. 1487, when John Tremayne was Sheriff of Cornwall ; the which Mr. Edgcumbe was a gentleman that hazarded his life and for- tune in espousing the Earl of Richmond's case and title to the Crown in opposition to King Richard III. He then lived at Cotehele aforesaid in Calstock parish ; and being"], [116, "102 MAKER. discovered to be one of that faction or party, he was forced to abscond and retire into the thick woods that then were and still are about Cotehele; nevertheless, King Richard, having notice of his absconding, ordered his officers to make diligent search for him, and in all probability had taken him, had he not rescued himself from their pursuit by an unparalleled accident, as Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 114, (page 270, Lord Dunstanville's edition), informs us, viz. \" at such tymes as those searchers were in his woods, and himself hid in a secret hole of the sea cliffe, the tide being full up, he put a small stone into his wear inge cap and threw it into the sea, which swimming in the water the winds and waves tossed it to and fro that it soone came to those seekers' sight and observation. :' Whereupon they concluded he had leapt into the sea and drowned himself for fear of their discovery and being taken by them, and so left over further quest after him, which gave him opportunity soon after in a small ship to waft over the British Channel to Britany to the Earl of Richmond, with whom afterwards he returned again into England, and was engaged with him in the battle of Bos worth Field in Leicestershire, where King Richard's army was overthrown and himself slain upon the spot. When soon after the said Mr. Edgcumbe was by King Henry VII. knighted and made one of his Privy Council ; and as a further reward of his good services, rewarded with the whole estate and lands of inheritance of Sir Henry Tre noweth, of Bodrigan, Knight, of a very great value, then forfeited by attainder of treason on the part of King Richard III. against King Henry VII.; as also with the Castle and Lordship of Totnes in Devon, with much other lands of John Lord Zouch, then also for the same fact for feited by attainder of treason against King Henry VII.

Him or his father I take also to be that Edgecumbe which founded at West Conworthy, on the west side of the river Dart, between the towns of Totnes and Dartmouth in Devon, a priory of Benedictine monks, whose revenues out of Zouch's lands was valued 26 Henry VI 1 1, when dis solved, 63/. 2s. 10c?. as the Monasticon Anglicanum in forms us.

Now as from the premises it appears those gentlemen's estates were greatly augmented by the bounty of King Henry VII. so after a grateful manner they have converted great sums of money towards the service of their prince and country; and to this purpose I find it recorded, that as Sir Richard Edgcumbe the first was Sheriff of Devon 2d Henry VII. so his son Sir Peers or Peter Edgcumbe aforesaid, was Sheriff of Devon 1 0th Henry VII. also the 13th; also the 9th of Henry VIIL also the 20th; also Sir Richard Edgcumbe that married Tregian, and built the pre sent house here called Mount Edgcumbe, 36th Henry VIIL also the 1st of Queen Mary ; also Peter Edgcumbe his son 9th Elizabeth."], [118, "104 .MAKER And of Cornwall Sir Peter Edgcumbe 14th and 15th of Henry VII. also 21st; also 8th of Henry VIIL also 26th.

Half of Millbrook in this parish and of Mount Edg cumbe lands, are part of the county of Devon, though severed from it by the Tamerworth sea or harbour ever since King Athelstan, anno Dom. 930, separated Devon from Cornwall, and made them several jurisdictions, which before were but one county or regniculum; and the reason in all probability why several parcels of land, not only here in this place, but in divers others on the east and west side of the Tamer river, the Devonshire side lands are an nexed to Cornwall, and the Cornwall side lands to Devon, was in all probability by reason the owners of those lands were possessed of lands both in Devonshire and Cornwall ; and it could not in any sense consist with justice that the Cornish men should lose their lands in Devcn, or the De vonshire men lose their lands in Cornwall, because those counties were divided by the river Tamar, and both peo ple under the dominion of one kinnr."], [119, "105 MAKER. This town of Milbrook, as I am informed, amongst others was once privileged with the jurisdiction of sending of two Members to sit in the Lower House of Par liament, but was divested of that privilege propter pau pertatem, tempore Henry VIIL for that the town was not able to pay their Burgesses' salary of 4s. per diem whilst they sat in Parliament; however, Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 101, tells us, that within his memory this town had near forty ships and barks at one time pertaining to the inhabitants thereof, that followed trade, merchandize, and fishing; but upon the breaking out of Queen Eliziibeth's wars with Spain, the townsmen neglected their usual honest employments and took up a more compendious though not so honest way of gaining, and began by little and little to reduce those plain dealers to their former undeserved plight, &c. id est, by piracy and privateering at sea. In this parish standeth Cremble Passage, the common place of transferring passengers by boat or barge over the rapid and dangerous waves of the Tamerworth Harbour or Sea Haven from the Cornish shore to the Plymouth or Devonshire side or lands, wherein many persons heretofore by the violence of the seas and wind in their passage have lost their lives. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not noticed this parish. THE EDITOR. This parish, forming the western boundary of Plymouth harbour, and extending between Hamoaze and the sea, occupies a situation more beautiful than any other on the whole coast. The church stands on the summit of the ridge, and its lofty tower was long an object of curiosity on account of"], [120, "106 MAKER the signals displayed on it to indicate the arrival of ships or fleets. From ten to twenty arbitrary signals were made, by means of differently shaped and coloured flags, displayed from a perpendicular staff, and by balls suspended on two others, rising at an inclined angle from the opposite parapets. The tardy adoption of a method, so simple and universal as that of conveying intelligence through the combination of signals, and of alphabetic writing, may be reckoned among the most curious anomalies of the human mind; when the common mode of what is called talking with the fingers actually does the thing itself, and Polybius, the friend of P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus, and his companion, at the destruction of Carthage, 145 years before our \u00e6ra, gives a detailed description of a method by which this ob ject may be attained, and dwells on its immense advantages. He admits indeed that difficulties must be expected in the execution ; but adds, \" In the present age the sciences are advanced to so great a perfection that almost every thing is capable of being taught by method.\" See the General His tory of Polybius, book 10, extract 7, chapter 2. It was, how ever, reserved for the French, in their Revolutionary War, to practise this art, and for the first time in the spring of 1794, more than nineteen hundred years after the sug gestion by Polybius, and notwithstanding repeated recur rences to nearly the same effect by various writers in modern times. Mr. Hals states, that in the valuation of Pope Nicholas this parish was assessed, the Rectory at 100s. the Vicarage at 53s. id.

Inceworth appears to have been the principal manor in this parish, and belongs to the family of Trefusis; it in cludes Milbrook, formerly a town of some consequence. Here were till very lately the brewhouses attached to the great naval establishment of this port; they are now re moved to The Point on the Devonshire side, where one of the most extensive and most useful works ever constructed for such purposes has been recently completed. Walls have been laid in deep water, by the use of diving bells, so as to allow of the largest ships coming quite in contact with the wharfs, and there receiving, in the course of a few hours, all the supplies of meat, bread, beer, water, &c. that are requisite for their going to sea. The object however which attracts the attention of strangers from all others in this parish, is the place formerly called Vaultershome, and afterwards West Stonehouse, but which Mr. Edgcumbe, who acquired it by a marriage with the heiress of the family of Durneford, its former possessors, chose to name Mount Edgcumbe, a proceed ing now sanctioned by time, as are those of the change from Port Prior to Port Eliot, and some others. It would be useless to describe this most beautiful and superb place, considered by many as altogether the finest gentleman's seat in the West of England. Nor can it be the least necessary to say any thing here of the distinguished family after whom it is called ; who have possessed an hereditary seat in Par liament since the year 1741, and for two descents have been Lord Lieutenants of Cornwall. By a strange absurdity this south-eastern extremity has been, notwithstanding that the whole river is attached to Cornwall, artificially considered as a part of Devonshire ; but this and other similar anomalies are in some degree corrected by modern acts of the legislature, the authority of magistrates for any county having been extended over these insulated portions of another, and the right of voting"], [122, "108 MAKER for Members of Parliament is brought back to its natural state by the enactments of 1832. A small town or village, partly in Maker, but extending into Rame, is distinguished by the double appellation of Kingston and Cawsand ; the latter name is applied to the bay formed by a recess of the land at this place, a bay ca pable of containing the. largest ships, and esteemed the least dangerous part of Plymouth Sound. The Harbour of Plymouth consists of three distinct parts, the Sound, entirely exposed to the violence of south and south-western winds, and two inner harbours, Catwater and Hamoaze ; the former adapted only for small vessels ; and Hamoaze rendered utterly inaccessible in bad weather by a ridge of rocks extending from Drake's Island to the western shore, thus restricting the only passage to a nar row and winding channel round that Island under the Hoe, and between Mount Edgcumbe and the Point. To remedy this most essential defect, by making a safe anchorage in the outer harbour, an immense work was commenced in August 1812, which should be called the Artificial Reef, from its close resemblance to a natural reef, and from its having been avowedly planned in imi tation of the coral reefs, abounding near all the Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Plymouth reef consists of a middle part a thousand yards long, and lying directly across the entrance of the Sound, and of two wings bending inwards at a small angle, each 350 yards long, making in all I1? 00 yards, or very nearly a mile. Advantage having been taken of a shoal, the depth under low water averages about 36 feet, and the height above low water is just 20 feet. The slope towards the sea forms an angle of 22\u00b0 with the horizon, giving an in crease of breadth of nearly two feet and a half for each foot of descent ; the slope towards the land forms an .angle of 33\u00b0 with the horizon, and increases one foot and a half for each foot of descent : consequently the increase of breadth on the whole is four feet for one of descent. The whole"], [123, "MAKER. 109 mass is composed of stones blown by the force of gun powder from limestone rocks on the river side, from whence they are rolled at once on board barges, which sail to the spot and drop them into sea. The whole weight of the reef is estimated at 2,500,000 tons. It may be curious to compare it with the largest building in the world. The Great Pyramid of Egypt mea sures 687 feet on each of its four sides, and the perpendi cular height is 480 feet; these dimensions, supposing the Pyramid to be solid, give a content of 76,500,000 cubic feet, and a weight exceeding 5,500,000 tons, more than double the weight of the reef, and the materials are large blocks hewn into regular forms, transported from a consi derable distance by land carriage, then raised into the air, and finally laid with cement in their exact places. The artificial reef has cost a million of money ; the Pyra mid must have required an amount of labour represented at present by perhaps twenty times that sum, a building without use or beauty, while the reef has made Plymouth one of the best harbours in the whole world.

In the Domesday Book, 1087, this district is not named, neither can I tell under what jurisdiction it was then taxed, unless Lizart, or Leschell, which latter may be a corrup tion of Kestell ; neither is the name Manackan Church of any great antiquity, for in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Be nefices, 1294, Ecclesia de Minster, in decanatu de Kerryer, (which is now called Manackan) is rated \u00a34, but in Wol sey's Inquisition, 1521, it is called Manackan, and valued \u00a34. 16s. 0\u00a3c?.

And lastly Manacan, as aforesaid; by both which names it is evident that heretofore there was some abbey or religious house of monks in this place or parish, wherein God was served with a minister; viz. vocal or instrumental music in time of divine service, as that appellation in British implies. And of this place we further read, (Carew's Survey of Cornwall, page 46,) the 12th Edward I. its revenues was rated for twelve Cornish acres of land, that is to say, seven hundred and twenty statute acres ; in that book, page 44, that the Bishop of Exeter held by tenure of knight service, in Minster in Kerrier, half a knight's fee of land, 3 Henry IV. ; proba- bly this Minster was some alien monastery or priory, sub- jected to some abbey beyond the seas, as many others were in this land, all dissolved by Act of Parliament, temp. Richard II. and Henry V. for transmitting the secrets of the State to their superior house aforesaid, in the French Wars ; for which reason perhaps it is not mentioned in the Monasticon Anglicanum, 26 Henry VIIL when other religious houses were dissolved ; neither for the like reasons are St. Neot's, Lancells, or St. Benet's in Lanyvet, which I take to be those three abbeys or priories mentioned by Dugdale and Speed to have been dissolved in Cornwall, the value of whose revenues they do not set down, but saith they were Black Monks of the Angells, for Black Monks of the Augustines. Moreover, let it be remembered that Manack is also a glove in British, and Manackan signifies the glove. Kes-tell, id est, a castle, probably the Reschell in the Domesday Book aforesaid, in this parish, so called from some British camp, intrenchment, or fortification, formerly upon the lands thereof, or contiguous therewith, on the sea-coast, gave name and original to an old family of gen tlemen now in possession thereof, surnamed de Kestell ;"], [126, "112 MANACCAN. and in particular John Kestell, Esq. sometime Commis sioner of the Peace and Taxes, that married Gregor of Tredenick; and giveth for his arms in a field Or three castles Gules.

The ancient name of this parish was Minster, which every one knows doth signify in Saxon a monastery, and from thence most commonly a church, and so it is called in the Taxatio Beneficiorum 20 Edward I. THE EDITOR. The ancient name of this parish, Minster, and the more recent one Manac-an, conspire to point it out as the locality of some religious establishment, since Manack is the Cornish word identical with Monk, and evidently from the same root, while an is the article, but although adjectives in all the Celtic dialects are placed after the substantive, yet the article regularly precedes it, and this inversion throws some doubt on the meaning of the compound word, more especially as not the slightest trace exists of any monastic institution within this parish in any authentic record, nor does tradition point out a spot where the foundation of a building can be perceived. There is not any thing worth remarking about the church; it is pleasantly situated, and surrounded by a neat church town.

Marham Church rectory, called Marwyn Church, Mar won Church, in some old books and manuscripts, is situate in the hundred of Stratton, and hath upon the north Strat ton parish, east Bridgerule and the Tamer river, south St. Mary Wick, west Poundstock. For the name, it sig nifies without doubt the house, home, habitation, or church dwelling (for so the words Mar and Ham do signify in the British, Armorican, and Scottish tongues) ; and by the name of Mar-om-cerch it was taxed in the Domesday book 20 William I. 1087, from whence it appears here was a famous endowed rectory church before the Norman Con quest; for vicarage churches, especially in Cornwall, sprung not up till after that time. The first of those appro priations of the advowsons of churches that I find on record in England, is that of William the Conqueror's, anno Dom. 1070, who by charter granted the patronages or advowsons of the churches of Feversham* and Middle ton in Kent to the abbey of St. Austin's in Canterbury, in these words : \" Donatio Domini Regis WTillielmi Anglorum de Ec clesiis Feveresham et de Middeltone. \" In nomine sancte et individue Trinitatis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

Afterwards King Edward III. 1349, appropriated to the same Abbey three other church advowsons, viz. Wivelsberge, Stone, and Brockland in Kent, ratified and confirmed by Pope Cle ment the Fifth's bull, and by Simon Mepham, then Arch bishop of Canterbury, with the establishment of three per petual vicarages in those churches. Of these sort of vicarage churches appropriated to Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, Abbots, Colleges, and Priories, there are in England about three thousand eight hundred and forty-five, in Cornwall one hundred and twenty-two ; most of them endowed with glebe lands and small tithes, except about fifteen of them wholly impro priate, the vicar subsisting only on a small salary or sti pend by custom or subscription. Wales-bury, i. e. the Wales or Welsh burying, or the place where some Welsh tribe lived and had their burying place or were interred, was another manor or lordship, under which jurisdiction this district was taxed 20 Wil liam I. 10S7, from whence was denominated an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed de Walesbury, who flou- i 2"], [130, "116 MARHAMCHURCH. rished here in worshipful degree and great affluence of wealth for many generations till the latter end of the reign of King Edward IV. ; at which time, the issue male failing, this estate fell amongst daughters, one of which was mar ried to Trevillian, who was no small advancer of the fame and wealth of that family. Of this family Thomas Wales bury was Sheriff of Cornwall 20 Henry VI. when Wil liam Wadham was Sheriff of Devon ; Thomas WTalesbury, his son, was Sheriff of Cornwall 32 Henry VI. when John Cheyney was Sheriff of Devon ; his son John Walesbury was Sheriff of Cornwall 37 Henry VI. when Richard Hals, of Kenedon, was Sheriff of Devon.

The church of this parish has the appearance of being very ancient ; it contains several monuments to former resi dents on the principal estates. Mr. Lysons says, that the manor of Marham Church has been in the families of Pyne, Stafford, and Rolles ; from the last it has descended to Trefusis. That the manor of Walesborough gave name to an an cient family residing there, from whom it went with an heiress to the family of Trevelyan, from whom it was pur chased by the late Mr. Justice Buller, and now belongs to his grandson. Mr. Lysons further states, that the manor of Hilton, also in this parish, was held jointly by the families of Cobham, Carminow, and Botreaux ; that it subsequently came into the possession of a Rolle, and now belongs to the Rev. John Kingdon. Wood-Knowle was formerly the residence of the Rolles, probably of the branch which came possessed of Hilton ; it is now the residence of the Rev. Henry Badcock. The Rev. John Kingdon is Patron of the rectory, and the present incumbent, instituted in 1818.

ST. MARTIN'S, near LOOE. HALS. St. Martin's rectory is situate in the hundred of West, and hath upon the north Morvall by Looe, south and west the British Channel and Looe Haven, east Seaton River and St. Germans. This parish is denominated from the church thereof, as it is from its tutelar guardian and patron .St. Martin, Bishop of Tours in France, which was a famous endowed rectory church before the Norman Conquest, as is testified by the Domesday book in Cornwall 20 William I. 1087, wherein we read, Lant Martin, i. e.

Within this parish stands the borough town of East Looe, that is to say, the town that stands on the east side of the River Looe ; for as loo, looe, lough, in the old Scots and Irish tongues and the French, signifies a lough, a lake, or pool of water, so it is sometimes used in the same sense in old British. East and West Looe towns, situate in the Looe Haven or harbour thereof, afford opportunities to the inhabitants for foreign and domestic trades and mer chandizes to be imported and exported, to their no small advantage. In which town of East Looe there is a chapel or oratory for divine service, wherein the rector of St. Mar tin's, or his curate, officiates on Sundays for convenience of its inhabitants. It was of old a privileged manor by prescription, all which was confirmed by a charter from Queen Elizabeth, the 29th year of her reign, whereby it was also incorporated by the name of the Mayor and free Burgesses, consisting of a Mayor and eight chief Burgesses or Council, the two Members of Parliament elected by the majority of them. It is also privileged with administration of justice within the liberties or precincts thereof, as also with a market on Saturday weekly, and fairs on the 2d of February and the 29th of September yearly. The arms of this town are a gallot (high ship) in the sea, rigged with ropes and yard, bearing three escutcheons, each charged with the arms of De Bodrugan. The writ to remove an action of law, depending in this Court Leet of East Looe, to a superior; and the precept for election of Members of Parliament from the Sheriff, must be thus directed : \" Majori et Burgensibus Burgi sui de East Looe, in comitatu Cornubi\u00e6, et eorum cuilibet, salutem.\" The history of Kevorall is by mistake placed under St. Germans, a contiguous parish, only parted by the Lynar or Seaton river, which should be placed here."], [134, "st. martin's, near looe. 120 TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing relative to this parish or town, but a long quotation from Browne Willis, wholly uninteresting ; and a conjecture that the chapel at Looe is dedicated to St. Kenna, usually pronounced St. Kayne, adding as a confirmation, that her festival is kept on the 30th of September, and that on the eve of that day a fair is established in the town. THE EDITOR. It will be unnecesary to enter on any details respecting either St. Martin's parish or Looe, since every thing cu rious or interesting may be found in a most excellent work : \" Topographical and Historical Sketches of the Boroughs of East and West Looe, in the County of Cornwall, with an account of the Natural and Artificial Curiosities, and Pic turesque Scenery of the Neighbourhood. By Thomas Bond, Esq. London, printed by and for J. Nichols and Son, 25, Parliament Street.\" Since Mr. Bond's work was published, both Looes have lost the privilege of sending Members to Parliament ; and it is said that a spirit of active exertion has already super seded the listless reliance on patronage which used to cha racterize small borough towns. A carnal has also been constructed to Leskeard, since the time of Mr. Bond's publication, promising to diffuse cul tivation and fertility over districts previously inaccessible to manure ; and now at its commencement the canal trans ports coal, lime, and other bulky commodities, to such an extent as to amply repay the sums expended on its formation. Another plan of a great work is in agitation, likely to render this beautiful and romantic neighbourhood the re sort of strangers from all parts of the kingdom. Cornwall is stretched out into the sea by an interrupted chain of granite hills, extending from Dartmoor to the Land's End."], [135, "ST. MARTIN'S, NEAR LOOE. 121 The valleys follow a general course on either side, transverse to the granite chain ; so that to avoid the perpetual recur rence of steep declivities, the main road has been carried along the middle line, above the formation of the valleys, or, as it is termed, on the backbone of the ridge, over a most uncultivated and dreary tract. It is now proposed, in consequence of the safe convey ance at all times by steam across the Tamar river from Plymouth, and in humble imitation of the road connecting France and Italy by the maritime Alps, to convey a new line of road along the face of the cliffs, over the debouches of the vallies, and across the Looe and Fowey rivers on lofty bridges, thus to avoid the hills, and to shorten the dis tance nine miles between Tor Point and St. Austell ; but the very large expense may possibly defeat the execution of a plan, which, in addition to the essential advantages already stated, would lead travellers to Falmouth, or to any part of the west of Cornwall, through a district as beautiful, as that which the road now traverses is unsightly and uncouth. The situation of East Looe is at once singular and pleas ing. The two rivers, uniting about half a mile above the bridge, expand into a lake, loch, or low, evidently bestow ing its name on the towns, and are then contracted into com paratively a narrow channel by the near approach of two steep hills. A beach has nevertheless been formed on the eastern and least precipitous side, by the meeting of the sea with the descending stream; and on this beach, secured by artificial mounds, and on the slope of the hill, East Looe is built. Perhaps the only other addition that I can make to Mr. Bend's work is to state that he himself has been the chief ornament of Looe for many years past, and that his ances tors may be found among the mayors and aldermen of the corporation, up to the period when the charter was given to the town."], [136, "ST. martin's, near looe. 122 Mr. Hals has detailed at great length the history of St. Martin of Tours, the undoubted patron of this parish. It may be sufficient to state a few particulars of this far famed personage. He was born in Hungary, of parents elevated in life, and commenced his early career in the Roman army, but afterwards became an ecclesiastic, having obtained celebrity, influence, and power, by adopting the most baneful of all practical heresies, founded on a belief that the favour of the Almighty may be effectually ob tained by reversing the order established by his Divine Pro vidence, and bestowing on idleness, profligacy, and vice, the legitimate rewards of industry, frugality, and care ; in consequence, he became the favourite of rogues, thieves, vagrants, and impostors, and has continued so in Catholic countries to the present time. A part of his high repu tation has however been derived from a more pure source. He supported the orthodox faith against the Arians, who at that period are supposed to have more than numerically divided the Christian Church. The most absurd and ridiculous legends are related of this Saint by his disciple St. Sulpicius, and by other writers. In one of these it is said that our Saviour himself appeared to him on a cold winter's night, under the disguise of a half naked wandering beggar ; and that Martin, then a soldier, not having any thing else to bestow, divided his cloak with a sword, and gave one portion of it to the supposed mendicant. In another, setting at defiance the precept \" Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,\" he allowed himself to be fastened with cords, immediately under the inclining trunk of a tree, as workmen were dividing the roots; but just as the tree was about to fall on him, he signed it with the sign of the cross, when instantly the trunk ascended, and reached the ground in an opposite di rection. Raising people from the dead, and resisting personal temptations of the devil, appear to have been fre quent and ordinary occurrences. He died at Tours, in the odour of sanctity, in the year 397, having held the bishop-"], [137, "ST. MARTIN'S, NEAR LOOE. 123 rick 26 years. The festival in honour of St. Martin is kept on the 11th of November, but parish feasts are not observed in the eastern parts of Cornwall. The advowson of this living, appurtenant to the manor of Pendrym, came to the family of Paulet, through the same succession as that which brought Ludgvan Lease, in cluding the high lordship of St. Ives; and a peculiar al though well-known relationship having continued to exist between the two properties, the learned Mr. Jonathan Toup was translated from the borough town to this rec tory in the year 1751, where he died, Jan. 19, 1785. A monument has been erected to Mr. Toup's memory by the Delegates of the Oxford Press, and he is there related to have been born in Dec. 1713. Mr. Toup has been men- tioned under St. Ives, the place of his birth. There are other monuments : \u2014 to Walter Langdon, of Keveril, stated to be the last of his race ; to Philip Maiowe, probably ancestor of John Mayo, or Mayow, M.D. Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and afterwards Physician at Bath*; also to the Rev. Stephen Midhope, sometime Rector of this parish, who died in the year 1636 ; but this gentle man, hurried away by the whirl of fanatical opinions, grow ing out of the Reformation, had resigned his living some years before, on professing himself an Anabaptist.

Mr. Hals mentions a Nunnery at a farm in this parish, called Hellnoweth, which Mr. Lysons says did belong to the Monastery of St. Michael's Mount; but there is not the slightest trace to be found in any authentic work of a separate establishment having ever existed there ; although Mr. Hals is so confident of it, as fancifully to derive the word Meneage from Menales, a supposed appellation of the nuns. All the parishes in the Lizard district, bounded by the Helford River and the Looe Pool, are said to be in Meneage, although no such division is recognised for any civil or ecclesiastical purpose.

This district of Meneage is a kind of peninsula, formed between the lakes or rivers Looe and Hayle, conjoined at the neck only by a little part of this parish of Mawgan with that of Gwendron and Helleston ; from whence further south in length and breadth, the land shooteth in towards the British Ocean, in the several parishes of St. Martin's, Manaccan, St. Anthony, Kevorne, Ruan Major, Ruan Minor, Landawednack, Grade, Cury, Mullyan, Gonwallo. Which peninsula is further notable for its great fertility between the rocks for corn and grass ; for as at St. Ke- vorne and other parishes, if wheat corn be seasonably tilled and well manured, it will produce commonly in the be- ginning of July a harvest of twenty bushels Cornish mea- sure, that is to say sixty bushels Winchester to a Cornish acre of land ; so in like manner this neck of land, being the most south-west part of this island of Britain, and situate between two seas, will in ten weeks time after the sowing of barley, produce a harvest in many places of much greater increase than that of wheat aforesaid. Moreover, it is also profitable for breeding and feeding bullocks and sheep of all sorts ; and particularly Gon-hilly Downs, id est the Hunting Downs, is notable for the breed of an under- statute sort of mares and horses, s.vift and sure of foot, and of great strength and hardiness for travel and labour. Which Downs consist of many hundred acres of land, all overspread with grey cloos, or a kind of marble stones as aforesaid. The barton and manor of Carmenow, Car-mvnow, Car-"], [143, "129 ST.

I know, contrary to this etymology, Mr. Carew tells us that Carminow is a little city, p. 55 Surv. Cornwall. But Caer- Vyan, or Caer- Byan, or Vyan-Caer, is a little city in Cornish ; Caer- Broas, Bruse, a great, large, or extensive city. Again, page 142, he tells us that the interpretation of Car-mynow is often-loving ; from which contradictory or cross etymo logy of this compound word aforesaid, it is evident he knew very little of the language of our ancestors the Britons, as his successor Mr. Camden did much less. This local place gave name and original to an old British family of gentlemen surnamed de Carmynow, now extinct, who flourished there for many generations in great fame and riches ; in particular here lived Robert de Carmynow, who held \u00a316 per annum by the tenure of knight service, who was summoned by writ, 48 Henry III. to come and take his degree of knighthood. (Carew's Survey of Corn- wall, page 50.) This gentleman, as tradition saith, accom- panied King Edward I. in the Holy War in Pales- tine. He had issue Ralph Carmenow, said to be Cham- berlain to King Edward II. ; who had issue Ralph Car- menow, Sheriff of Cornwall 2 Richard II. 1379.

(father of William Lord Scrope, Earl of Wilt- shire and Lord Treasurer of England 21 Richard II. and Knight of the Garter, beheaded at Bristol for attainder of treason against Henry IV. anno Dom. 1399,) happened a memorable trial in the Court of Chivalry, or Earl Mar shal's Court, about the bearing on their shields, or coat armour, viz.

To this declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and in justification of the bearing aforesaid, said that his an cestors were Cornish Britons ; and lived at Carmenow long before the Norman Conquest ; and particularly, that one of them was sent by King Edward the Confessor an ambas sador, either to the French King or Duke of Normandv ; who gave those arms in and for his device, or shield ; and that from that time to the time of King Edward III. afore said, which was about three hundred years, his posterity had ever given or borne the same arms, without interrup tion or alteration. To this the plaintiff rejoined, that there was then no such public record extant in the Office of Arms, or Marshal's Court, that appropriated any such bearing to this name or family of Carmenow, neither was the Provincial Herald called Clarencieux, for granting arms and recording the r. . \"^ descents of private gentlemen for the south-west part of England, instituted but just before this action; and there fore, if the said Ralph Carmenow, or his ancestors, gave those arms, they were only personal badges or devices that terminated with their lives, and could not be hereditary or descend to posterity. And further it was alleged that in case Carmenow's ancestor lived at Carmenow before the Norman Conquest, those arms could not be appropriated to him by the name of de Carmenow, for it was not the custom of the Britons till about a hundred years after, to style themselves from local places with the Latin pronoun"], [145, "131 ST.

But be fore were generally distinguished by the names John Mac Richard, Richard Mac Thomas, Robert ap Ralph, &c. that is to say the son of Thomas, Robert, and Ralph, ac cording to their lineal descents. Whereupon, after a full view and hearing of what could be said and shown on either part, by learned council as to records, manuscripts, deeds and pedigrees, the Earl Mar shal, in Westminster Hall, gave judgment for the plaintiff; and the definitive sentence was afterwards made and signed with the public seal of that Court, and read in open audi ence ; and orders given to the Sub-Marshal to put the same in execution ; which was, that Carmenow should never more give the arms aforesaid without a label of three points Gules for a distinction ; when accordingly the same was first en tered of record in Clarencieux, or the Provincial Herald's books, as the subsequent hereditary coat armour of his family, (and as tradition saith Carmenow paid costs,) which rule was ever after by those gentlemen observed in their bearings. And though Carmenow's friend pleased themselves in this distinction of a label, because given by the Emperor of Rome's son and heir whilst his father was alive ; and for that it is the mark or cognizance of the eldest son and heir of a family of the greatest degree ; yet it is manifest Car menow himself was so distasted therewith, that he chose for the motto of this new bearing arms, a Cornish sentence which abundantly expressed his dislike thereof: Cala rag Ger da, id est, a straw for fame, or breath.

This John Carmenow suffered the barton and manor of Carmenow, with other lands, to go in mar riage with his two daughters and heirs, married as aforesaid ; whilst the greatest part of his ancient estate, by virtue of the entail, after his decease descended to his younger bro ther, John Carmenow, of Fentongollan, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall 5 Henry VIIL In this local place of Carmenow those gentlemen had their ancient domestic chapel and burying place, the walls and windows whereof are still to be seen ; in which place also formerly stood ihe tombs and funeral monuments of divers once notable persons of this family; of which sort, in the beginning of King James the First's reign, when this chapel was left to run to ruin and decay, the inhabitants of this parish of Mawgan, out of respect to the memory of those gentlemen, brought from thence two funeral monu- o ' D ments in human shape, at full length, made of alabaster, freestone, or marble, man and woman I take it, curiously wrought and cross-legged, with two lions couchant under their feet, and deposited or lodged them in this parish church of St. Mawgan, where they are yet to be seen, though the inscriptions and coat armour thereof are now obliterated and defaced by time. Now, though it was the custom to form the funeral monuments of such as had been in the Holy War temp. Richard I. and Edward I. cross legged, yet I find that posture of monuments for the dead was much more ancient, and placed on the tombs of such as had never been in the Holy War, in memory of the cross whereon our Blessed Saviour suffered for our re demption and salvation. Lastly, it is further observable of this family of Carmenow, that, notwithstanding their great estate, gentility, and antiquity, they never had any higher title of honour or dignity conferred upon them by our English Kings than that of Knights Bachelors, of which sort two or three of them had been knights.

Originally the Vyvyans were possessed of Trevederne in Buryan, as they still are.; and from thence matched with the daughter and heir of Skyburiow, afterwards with the daughter and heir of Ferrers of Trelowarren ; which first brought those lands into the possession of Vyvyan ; particu larly as I am informed Richard Vyvyan, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall 9 Henry VII. 1494 ; Richard Vyvyan, Esq. his son, was Sheriff of Cornwall 20 Henry VIII ; Michael Vyvyan, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 22 of Henry VIIL ; Hanniball Vyvyan, Esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 43 of Elizabeth; whose son, Frances Vyvyan, Esq. afterwards knighted, was Sheriff of Cornwall 15 James I. who built the house now extant at Trelowarren, and married one of the coheirs of Vyell, of Trevorder. His son, Richard Vyvyan, Esq. afterwards, 12 February 1644, by King Charles I. was created the 384th Baronet of Eno-land. married Bulteel, and had issue by her Sir Vyell Vyvyan, Baronet, afterwards knighted by King Charles II. ; who married Thomasin, daughter and heir of James Robins, of Penryn, Gent. Attorney-at-Law, who died without issue ; afterwards he married Jane, daughter of Thomas Mel huish, of Penryn, Gent, the relict of Michael Cood, but"], [149, "135 ST. MAWGAN IN MENEAGE died without issue that lived. Note that the name Mel huish is local, viz. from the barton or tenement of Mel huish, near Kirton in Devon, which signifies a lark-bird, or larks, as alauda. After Sir Vyell Vyvyan's decease, his nephew Sir Ri chard Vyvyan, Baronet, that succeeded to his estate and honour, son and heir of Charles Vyvyan, Esq. Barrister-at- Law, (younger brotherof Sir Vyell aforesaid) by Erisey, mar ried Mary, daughter and heir of Francis Vivian, of Coso warth, Esq. by Anne, daughter and heir of Henry Mynors, of St. Enedor, Gent, by Bridget, the only surviving child of Sir Samuel Cosowarth, Knight, and sole heir to her brother Nicholas Cosowarth, Esq. that died without issue temp. Charles II. By the which Mary Vyvian, his lady, Sir Richard is now in possession of Cosowarth and Vivian's lands. Sir Richard Vyvyan, Bart, first mentioned, had also issue by Bulteel five daughters, married to Robinson, Tre wren, &c. The arms of this family are in a field Argent, a lion rampant Gules. TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least consequence different from Mr. Hals. THE EDITOR. It is curious that this parish should have afforded resi dences to three families so distinguished as Carminow, Reskymer, and Vyvyan. The two first have been long extinct; Vyvyan still continues one of the first in Cornwall. Sir Richard Vyvyan, mentioned by Mr. Hals, adhered to what was thought by many in those days to be the good old cause of the Cavaliers and the Restoration of Charles the Second ; and in consequence King George the First"], [150, "136 ST. MAWGAN IN MENEAGE. and his ministry, excusing themselves perhaps by the au thority, Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt Moliri, not only removed all their suspected opponents from the commission of the peace, and from places of trust, but com mitted several to prison. Among others Sir Richard Vy vyan, who was seized in his house at Trelowarren, conveyed by water to Pendennis Castle, and removed from thence to the Tower. A story is related of a king's messenger having been de tained at an inn called Hallworthy, east of Camelford, while an adherent reached Trelowarren, and enabled Su fi ichard Vyvyan to destroy many documents, which might have proved his being adverse, as well as many other Cor nish gentlemen, to the new government. As the persons then in power failed of being able to prove any overt acts taken against themselves, they were obliged to discharge this gentleman out of custody ; but not till he had a daughter, Ann Vyvyan, born in the Tower, whom the Editor well remembers; and Sir Richard Vyvyan was, as a matter of course, chosen one of the re presentatives for the county at the next election, which situation he had however held in some former Parliaments. He married Mary, only daughter and heir of Vyvyan of Cosowarth, in the parish of Little Colan, and left a nu merous family. His eldest son, Vyel Vyvyan, married Mary, daughter and heiress of the Rev. Carew Hoblyn, and left two sons, Richard, who married Jane, daughter of Christopher Haw kins, Esq. of Trewinnard, and of Mary, coheiress of the Hawkinses of Penzance :\u2014 they had not any family ; and Carew the second son, a clergyman, never married. Richard, the second son of Sir Richard Vyvyan, married the heiress of the family of Piper, and settled at their seat called Modford, almost in the town of Launceston."], [151, "137 ST. MAWGAN IN MENEAGE. Their eldest son Philip, married Mary, the daughter and heiress of Sheldon Walter, Esq. and through her mother heiress of the Medlands, of Tremail, in South Petherwin. Their son, Vyel, succeeded to the family estate, and having married Mary, daughter of Thomas Hutton Rawlinson, of Lancaster, Esq. has been succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan, of whom it may be sufficient to say, that, having been very early in life elected member for the county of Cornwall, he so distinguished himself in Parliament as to receive an invitation from all the leading gentlemen of Bristol, to represent their city, when a differ ence of political opinion severed him from the constituent body of Cornwall, and that he has twice obtained the honour of being elected Member for the second city in England. Trelowarren alone remains of the seats in this parish, and it amply compensates for the disappearance of the others. No place in the county, excepting perhaps Pen hale in Egloskerry, comes into comparison with Trelowar ren, as a gentleman's residence in the style of former times. The house is believed to be more ancient than the time assigned to it by Mr. Hals, and that Mr. Francis Vyvyan only repaired and possibly enlarged a building at the least as old as the possession of the Ferrers. Sir Richard Vy vyan almost entirely reconstructed the interior of the house, soon after the year 1750, and great improvements have been made by the present proprietor, and by his father. Doctor Borlase has given a view of the house, page 86 of his Natural History. The manor of Carminow continued long in the family of Arundell : it is now by purchase the property of the Rev. John Rogers. A detailed account of the curious trial before the judges of the Court of Chivalry, and ultimately before the King himself in person, relative to the arms borne by the Carmi nows, has been given in \" Anecdotes of heraldry,\" published by a lady about thirty years since. The decision of the"], [152, "138 ST. MAWGAN IN MENEAGE. King is there stated to be, that each claimant should bear the arms without differences. The motto given by Mr. Hals is literally in Cornish, Cala rag ger da, a straw for a good word. Mr. Lysons, quoting from \" The Scrope and Grosvenor Roll,\" another controversy on the same armorial coat, (and which has been recently published by Sir Harris Nicolas) notices that testimony was adduced on behalf of the Car minows, tracing the use of their arms back to the reign of our renowned King Arthur ! To such evidence on armo rial bearings, as Lysons justly remarks, little credit is due. The church is large, and contains some ancient monu ments, believed to be of the Carminow family, with shields and other decorations. The advowson of the living belongs to the Trevelyans, of Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, and one of that family is the incumbent.

In the Domesday Book, 20 William I. 1087, this dis trict was taxed under the name of Lan-cherit ; here was an endowed rectory, chapel or church before that time ; and the same endowed by the Prior of the Priory of Plympton (founded by the West Saxon Kings). Afterwards, when this old church was re-edified and enlarged to the mode and bulk it now shows, it was then consecrated or dedicated to the honour of Almighty God, in the name of St. Mawgan aforesaid ; and this is evidenced from the Inquisitions of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, 1294, into the value of Benefices, in decanatu de Pidre, Sancti Maugani \u00a36. 13s. id., and the Prior of Plympton received \u00a3] . 6s. 8c?.

The issue male of the Pincernas failing, the two daugh ters and heirs of his family were married, temp. Edward III. to Arundell, of Trembleth in St. Ervan, and Umphravill ; hence it is we read in the Rolls of the Exchequer and Carew's Survey of Cornwall, page 43, Johannes de Umfran vill tenet in decanatu de Pidre, ratione Alici\u00e6 uxoris su\u00e6, unam mag. feod. in Lanherne, 3d Henry IV. After Arundell's match with Pincerna's heir, he removed to Lanherne, which hath ever since been the seat of that famous and flourishing family, who derive their name from John de Arundell, temp. Henry I. ; since which time (for about twenty-three descents) they have married with the inheritrixes of Trembleth, Pincerna, Lamburne, Lescor, Lanbaddern, Tresithny, Carmenow, Grey, Denham, and several others ; so that by reason of their wealth, or great estates, the country people heretofore entitled them by the name of the Great Arundells, (see Mr. Carew's Survey of Cornwall, page 144,) though there was a great diminution of their ancient estate at and after the time that John Arun dell, temp. Queen Mary, married Anne, the daughter of Sir Henry Gernigan, Knight, Master of the Horse, or Cap tain of the Guards to that Queen. However, I take it his son or grandson, John Arundell, Esq. married the co heir of Chydiock, and thereby repaired part of that loss, and bad by her issue John Arundell, Esq. afterwards knighted, who married Elizabeth Roper, daughter of the Lord Teynham, and by her had issue two sons that died without issue, and Elizabeth, married to Sir Richard Billinge, knight ; married to Sir Robert Beding-"], [155, "MAWGAN IN PYDER. 141 field, knight ; and that was entered into a mo nastery of Benedictine nuns in France, as I am informed. Sir John Arundell, knight, (my very kind friend,) after his lady's decease, took for his second wife daugh- ter of John Arundell, of Trerice, esq. the relict of John Trevanion, of Caryhayes, esq. by whom he had no issue. Whereupon the said Sir John Arundell, having by fine, proclamation, and recovery, docked his estate tail to bar the remainder, settled the same upon his grandson, Richard Billinge, Esq. by his last will and testament ; on condition that he and his posterity for ever should assume the sur name of Arundell, in conjunction with that of Billinge, or separate, anno Dom. 1701. The first gentleman of this family that appears on public record to have served the state or the country, was Sir John Arundell, knight, Sheriff of Cornwall, 6 Henry V. 1418, when Stephen Durneford was Sheriff of Devon. Renfry Arundell, esq. his son, was Sheriff of Cornwall 16 Henry VI. 1443, (when one Thomas Arundell was Sheriff' of Devon,) Renfry Arundell, esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 3 and 4 Edward IV. 1483. John Arundell, son of the said Renfrye, had his first education in the college of Canons Augustine in St. Co lumb, partly founded and endowed by his ancestors ; from whence he removed to Exeter College, in Oxford, where, after he had taken his degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts, he was ordained Priest, and presented by his father to the great rectory of St. Colmub Major in Cornwall ; and accordingly, had institution and induction thereto from the Bishop of Exeter ; afterwards he was chosen Dean of Exeter, when Doctor Fox was Bishop thereof, 1490 ; where after he had sat for some time, upon the translation of William Smith, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, to Lincoln, (the successor of John Hals, who died 1492,) he had bestowed upon him by King Henry VII. that bishoprick, and was consecrated anno Dom. 1496 ;"], [156, "142 MAWGAN IN PYDER. afterwards, upon the death of Dr. Redman, Bishop of Exeter, 1504, he was translated to that diocese, and was in stalled Bishop thereof 1504; where, after he had well go verned that diocese for about two years space, he died at London, 19 February 1506, and lies buried in St. Cle ment's Church without Temple Bar. From this family, by younger branches, were descended, temp. Richard III. the knightly family of the Arundells late of Tolvorne (from whence the writer of those lines by females is descended) ; as also the Arundells, late of Tre vithick, in St. Columb Major, temp.

Though this family by the name of Arundell is set forth in Battle Abbey corrupted roll, to have come out of France with the Conqueror, I take it to be denominated from Arundell town and castle in Sussex, (for as Sir John Arundell, the last possessor of Lanherne, told me he could never understand there was any such local place in France as Arundell, though he lived long in that country and made strict inquiry after it,) for Ederick the Saxon was Earl of Arundell town and castle aforesaid, before Wil liam the Conqueror landed here, who after the death of King Harold was displaced and disinherited by the Con queror, and Roger de Montgomery made Earl thereof in his place, to whom his estate was given.

Car-nan-ton in this parish, id est, the Rock Valley Town, was the voke lands of a considerable manor, taxed in the Domesday Book 1087.

Henry IV. as Mr. Carew informs us. It was lately the dwelling of William Noye, of Pendrea in Buryan, Esq. farmer thereof; who was first bred a student at law in Lincoln's Inn ; afterwards, having taken his degrees therein, he was chosen Member of Parliament for the town of St. Ives in Cornwall, in which capacity he * Probably a Bishop in Partibus Iofidelium."], [158, "144 MAWGAN IN PYDER. stood for some Parliaments in the beginning of the reign of King Charles I. and was specially famous for being one of the boldest and stoutest champions of the subject's liberty in Parliament that the Western parts of England afforded ; which being observed by the Court party, King Charles was advised by his Cabinet Council that it would be a prudent course to divert the force and power of Noye's skill, logic, and rhetoric another way, by giving him some Court preferment ; whereupon King Charles made him his Attorney-general, 1631 ; by which expedient he was soon metamorphosed from the assertor of the subjects' liberty and property to a most zealous and violent promoter, be yond the laws, of the despotic and arbitrary prerogative or monarchy of his Prince; so that, like the image of Janus at Rome, he looked forward and backward, and by means thereof greatly enriched himself. Amongst other things he is reflected upon by our chro nologers for being the principal contriver of the Ship money tax, laid by King Charles upon his subjects, for setting forth a navy or fleet of ships at sea, without the consent of Lords or Commons in Parliament ; which moneys were raised by writ to the Sheriffs of all counties, and Commissioners for a long time brought into the Ex chequer twenty thousand pounds per mensem, to the great distaste of the Parliament, the Laity, and Clergy, who de clared against it as an unlawful tax. Nevertheless all the twelve judges after Noye's death, except Hutton and Crook, gave their opinions and hands to the contrary, in Hamp den's case ; viz. Branston, Finch, Davenport, Denham, Jones, Trevor, Vernon, Berkeley, Crawley, and Weston. (See Baker's Chronicle, printed 1656.) However, out of kindness to the clergy, the King wrote to all the Sheriffs of England, requiring that the clergy, possessed of parson ages or rectories, should not be assessed above a tenth part of the land rate of their several parishes, and that regard should be had to vicars accordingly ; by which rule the quanto or sum of this Ship-money Tax by the month may"], [159, "MAWGAN IN PYDER. 145 be calculated. But I shall conclude this paragraph of Noye in the words of Hammon Le Strange, Esq. in the Life of King Charles I. viz. \" Noye became so servilely ad- dicted to the King's prerogative, by ferreting up old penal statutes, and devising new exactions, for the small time he \u25a0enjoyed his power, that he was the most pestilent vexation to the subject that this latter age afforded,\" &c. He died on Saturday, August the 9th 1634, and was buried in the church of New Brentford, Middlesex, with an inscription on a stone to this purpose : \" Here lyes the body of Wil- liam Noye, Esq. som tyme Atturney Generall to Kinge Charles I.\" This gentleman writ that excellent book of the law called Noye's Reports ; he married and had issue : Edward Noye, his eldest son, killed in a duel soon after his father's death ; and Humphrey Noye, his second son.

TONKIN. The patron of this parish is St. Mawgan, one of the missionaries from Ireland. It is a rectory, in the patronage of Sir John Arundell, of the Lanhearne, which was the ancient name of the parish ; which, says the author of the English Etymological"], [163, "MAWGAN IN PYDER. 149 Dictionary, is not unlikely from Lan, a church, and Herwa, to fly, meaning a place of refuge. I shall begin with the most important place, THE MANOR OF LANHEARNE. This place had formerly possessors of the same name, but how long they lived in it is uncertain ; for I can meet with but one and the last of them ; John de Lanhearne, who by Margaret, the daughter and heir of Richard Fitz John, had only one daughter and heir, Alice, married the 15th Henry III. (A. D. 1231) to Sir R. Arundell, of Trembleth, Knight, ever since which time Lanhearne hath been the principal seat of this illustrious family. I shall not here enter into a detail of the many great men it hath produced, referring myself to their well known pedigrees ; and shall only take notice here that the Lord Arundell of Wardour, Arundell of Tolvorne, Trevethick, &c. were de scended from younger branches thereof; and insert what Mr. Camden and Mr. Carew say of them. The first hath these words : \" Near which place (St. Colomb), at a little distance from the sea, stands Lanhearon, the seat of the family of the Arundells, knights, who upon account of their vast riches, were not long since called ' The Great Arundells.' They are sometimes called in Latin De Hirundine; and appositely enough in my mind, for a swallow in French is Hirondelle, and their arms are, in a field Sable, six swal lows Argent. 'Tis certainly an ancient and noble family, as also very numerous : to the arms whereof Brito, a poet, alludes, where he describes a warlike man of this family attacking a Frenchman, about the year 1170.

The country people entitle them < The Great Arundells,' and greatest for love, living, and respect, in the country heretofore they were.\" (See Carew, p. 343, Lord De Dunstanville's edition.) THE EDITOR. The name of Arundell has not, in all probability, any thing to do with swallows. It is on the contrary derived from their Castle in the Arun Dale, Sussex, which like all other British or Saxon names having the slightest resem blance in sound to a French word, has been referred to a Norman origin. Mr. Lysons says that Sir John Arundell, the last of the Lanhearne branch, or parent stock, who died in 1701, settled his estates on his grandson, Richard Billinge, Esq. with the condition of his taking the name of Arundell. This gentleman had an only daughter and heiress, who carried the property by her marriage to the Lords Arundell of Wardour. It does not appear that any of the Wardour Arundells have ever resided at Lanhearne; with a sectarian attach ment to the ancient faith, they kept up a Catholic esta blishment at this place, and retained great numbers of the parishioners in communion with the See of Rome, by mak ing it a passport to lucrative employment and to good cheer ; but the house having been appropriated to the reception of Nuns from Antwerp, of the order of Carmelites, as re formed by St. Tereza, and the secular establishment broken up, the system of private interpretation has entirely su perseded the authority of Popes and Councils, so that not a Catholic can now be found without the walls. The Nuns were received here on their flying from the French Inva sion to their native country, for all were English, and their numbers are still maintained by fresh recruits. Henry Arundell, the 8th Baron Arundell, of War-"], [165, "MAWGAN IN PYDER. 151 dour, having built a magnificent house adjacent to the old castle, and feeling little interest about the property in Cornwall, although it is said to have regularly descended through the Dinhams, from a period anterior to the Nor- man Conquest, sold the whole in parcels, with the excep- tion of Lanhearne, and has thereby several the very an cient connexion of his family with this county. The church stands near the river, and adjacent to the house of Lanhearne. It is decorated on the inside with a rood loft, very few of which have been suffered to remain, and by monuments to the Arundells, with inscriptions, most of which may be found in Mr. C. S. Gilbert's History of Cornwall. There is also another to Humphrey Noye, which, as his descendant and heir, the Editor hopes he may be excused for transcribing : Here lyeth the Body of Collonell Humphry Noye, Son and Heir of William Noye, of Carnanton, Esqe, Attorney Generall to Charles The First, of Blessed Memory, King of Great Britaine, France, And Ireland. Who was intered the 12th of December, Annoqe Dom : 1679. On the stone are the arms : Arg. three bends and a canton Sab. on the canton an English cross of the Field. The crest of Noye is a dove bearing an olive branch, and the motto : Teg yw Hedwch, Lovely in Peace. Evi dently an allusion to the names Noye and Noah. The above words were on a slate stone laid flat on the pavement, so that the letters were beginning to disap pear ; but Mr. Humphry Willyams, his successor in Car narton, although not his descendant, has recently preserved"], [166, "152 MAWGAN IN PYDER. the stone and the inscription, by placing this memorial perpendicularly against one of the walls. The manor of Carnarton belonged to the father, if not to the grandfather, of the Attorney-general. He was born however at Pendrea, in St. Burian, where the family had been settled time out of mind, but understood to be of Norman extraction. Little is known of Mr. Noye's early life, till he became a member of Exeter College, in the year 1593. He re moved from thence to Lincoln's Inn, and was chosen Member for Helston to the Parliament which met in January 1620. He afterwards represented St. Ives, and certainly took an active, zealous, and able part in fostering the nascent liberties of his country ; but having formed a connexion with Mr. Wentworth, he became a partizan in what was afterwards named the Stafford Faction, was made Attorney-general in 1631, devised the exaction of Ship Money, and conducted himself in a manner very different from the promise of his former days ; fortunately for him self, Mr. Noye died in 1634, before the more violent agita tions commenced, which terminated in the Civil War. He left three children, Edward his eldest son and heir, Hum phrey, and Catharine. Edward lost his life not long after the Attorney-gene ral's decease, in a duel with a Captain Byron. Humphrey then inherited the property. Catharine married John Cartwright, esq. of Aynhoe, in Northamptonshire, whose descendant in the fifth degree, William Ralph Cartwright, is now of that place (1835), and Member for the county. Mr. Noye's will is so curious as to be worthy of insertion : Incerta mortis hora, hodie ventura, suspecta esse debeat Christiano : sensi me gravatum : mens tamen, Deo annu ente, sanitate viget (quam nollem in extremis de munda riis cogitare) hinc est quod \u2014 Ego Will'mus Noye die mensis Junii tertio, anno Do mini millesimo sexcentesimo trigesimo quarto, rerum me-"], [167, "153 MAWGAN IN PYDER. arum dispositionem, per pr\u00e6sens testamentum meum (Dei nomine primitus invocato) ut inferius scriptum est ordinare statui.

Mr. Noye had the honour of receiving the public thanks of his College, under the following circumstances: Sir William Petre, son of John Petre, of Torbryan in Devon- shire, well known as Secretary of State in the time of King Henry the Eighth, and successively in the reigns of his three successors, had been a Commoner of Exeter College, and from thence elected a Fellow of All Souls. He after- wards became Principal of Peckwater Hall, one of the Visitors of Religious Houses, and finally Secretary of State. Sir John Petre, by participating in the good fortune of all those who were favourites at Court in this eventful period of our history, appropriated to himself a share of the Con- fiscated Church Lands, most profusely distributed ; and by so doing became the founder of a family still existing, with an hereditary seat in Parliament, and professing the Catholic religion. Wishing perhaps to make some resti- tution, Sir John Petre founded eight Fellowships at Exeter College, in the Protestant University of Oxford, to all of which, called Petrean Fellowships, he continued to nomi- nate during his life, according to an ancient custom in similar cases ; but when his successors attempted to exer- cise the same right or privilege, they were resisted by the College, and the cause came to be tried in the Court of Common Pleas, under the form of a replevin ; they were successfully and gratuitously supported by Mr. Noye, as will appear from the passage in the College Register.

The Editor possesses a picture of Mr. Noye painted on oak, by Cornelius Jansen ; and at the desire of Exeter College, he has recently presented to them a copy, which is placed in the Hall. Mr. Noye was succeeded by his eldest son Edward; but the melancholy forebodings expressed in his will : \" I have left all the remainder of my property to my son Ed ward (whom I have constituted executor of this my will) to be squandered, nor have I ever hoped any better,\" were rendered vain by the death of this young man, soon after that of his father, in a duel with a Captain Byron. Humphrey then succeeded as eldest son, and in the year 1637 allied himself by marriage with the very distin guished family of Sandys, of The Vine, near Basingstoke, in Hampshire. The Editor has their marriage contract, which may be esteemed a curiosity, as compared with the more lengthened writings of recent times. \" Articles of agreement, indented, had, made, and agreed upon the three and twentieth day of May, in the thirteenth"], [171, "157 MAWGAN IN PYDER. year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord Charles, by the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c.

Mr. Willyams married secondly Dorothy, daughter of Mr. John Day, by whom he had two sons.' John, the elder, married the daughter and heiress of Mr. Oliver, a gentleman of Falmouth. They had a son, Mr. John Oliver Willyams, for many years Colonel of the Cornwall Militia; and a daughter Ann, married to Mr. William Lemon, jun. only son of the great Mr. Lemon.

Mr. Cooper Willyams died July the 17th, 1816, leaving two sons and two daughters.

Mr. Hals devotes some pages to the virulent abuse of Colonel Humphrey Noye, against whom it is obvious that he must have entertained a personal animosity ; but the Editor, having omitted various similar effusions, hopes that he shall not be accused of any partial favour towards his own ancestors, by omitting this also, which does not carry with it the semblance of truth.

He was the father of Sir John Coryton, of this place, who, the 27th February 13 Charles II. 1661, was by his letters patent of that date, created the 605th Baronet of England. He married Mills of Exeter, and had issue by her Sir John Coryton, Bart, his eldest son ; who married one of the heirs of Mr. Richard Chiverton, Knight, bred a Skinner in London, and was Lord Mayor of that city 9 Charles II. 1657, by whom he had issue two daughters. He was Sheriff of Cornwall, 1682. After his decease his younger brother, William Coryton, Esq. Barrister-at-law, succeeded to his honour and estate; who married the daughter of Sir Theophilus Biddulph, of Westcomb, in Kent, the 744th Baronet of England, by letters patent, bearing date 2 November 16 Charles II. ; by whom he had issue Sir John Coryton, Bart, now extant. After Sir William's first wife's death, he married the widow and relict of Thomas Williams, Gent, a gold smith or banker of Lombard Street, in London ; by whom, though a very aged woman, to recompence that defect he had much riches or wealth. After his death she married Sir Nicholas Trevanion, of St. Germans, who followed in marriage the Delphic Oracle's direction, and Dion's, Refuse noe woman nere soe old, Whose marriage bringeth store of gold.

Denominated, I suppose from Trevisa, or Tre-wisa, in St. Enedor, and originally descended from John Trevisa, born in Gloucestershire (as Baker saith), who being for some time bred in Oxford, afterwards took orders, and became a secular priest, that might marry ; and then became do mestic chaplain to Thomas Lord Berkeley, by whom he was afterwards made Vicar of Berkeley in Gloucestershire ; where, at that Lord's request, he translated the Sacred Bible into the English tongue, though the same was done by John Wickliff fifty years before, but not with that per fection of language that Trevisa did it ; although Trevisa's translation is altogether as far short of Tyndall's in Henry the Eighth's days, by reason the English tongue was still improving to a higher perfection ; and yet Tyndall's trans lation was far inferior to that of King James I. notwith standing they all agree in the original substance, sense, and meaning of words in those translations; wherein Wick liff, Trevisa, and Tyndall, made use of infinite Cornish- British words to express the same. Neither is the last translation of King James I. altogether void of them. Mr. Trevisa also translated Bartholomew de Proprie tatibus Rerum ; the Poly-chronicon of Ralph Higden ; a treatise of all the Acts of King Arthur; and divers other things.

However I hear lately, notwithstanding this his promise of returning in two years space to Pentiley, that Sir James's body is eaten out with worms, and his bones or skeleton fallen down to the ground from the chair wherein it was seated, about four years after it was set up; his wig, books, wearing apparel, also rotten in the box or chair where it was first laid. TONKIN. I take this parish, as well as Mullion in Kerrier, to take its name from its tutelar saint, Melania. The church is a rectory ; the patronage in Sir John Coryton.

William de Ferrers was Knight of this shire with Thomas Sereod, Knight, 8 Edward II. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has given a long history of St. Melania, the supposed patron of this church, containing, however, little more than the usual details of effects produced by the ascetic fanaticism popular in those days. Personal suffer ings and privations were then endured, under a persuasion that bodily pain, mental stupidity, and a course of life ut terly useless to the human race, could alone ensure the divine favour, in opposition to the sentiments, Hie manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi ; Quique sacerdotes casti, dum vita manebat; Quique pii vates et Ph\u0153bo digna locuti ; Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes; Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo. Newton came into the family of Coryton, by a marriage with the heiress of Ferrers, and continued till that family became extinct in the male line, on the decease of Sir John Coryton in 1739, who gave the property to his widow Ra- chael, a daughter of Weston Helyar, Esq. of East Coker in Somersetshire ; and it has continued with her relations nearly to the present time, under an entail, which carried Newton from Mr. Weston Helyar, probably a great-grand- son of the gentleman above mentioned, to several other younger brothers ; till the failure of heirs male in all these brought it back to the son or grandson of the elder brother, who, wishing to concentrate his property in Somersetshire, has parted with the whole Cornish estate to Edward Col lins, Esq. of Truthan. Although Sir John Coryton alienated his principal seat"], [180, "166 ST. MELLION, OR ST. MELLYN. and manor by this bequest to his widow, he devised a large share of the family property to the descendants of his eldest sister Elizabeth, who married William Goodall, of Fowey ; and their grandson, on succeeding to the estate, assumed the name of Coryton. The present representative of this ancient family, John Tillie Coryton, Esq. has built a mag nificent house or castle at Pentilly in a most beautiful situation, on the Tamar river, so that he need not regret the loss of Newton. Sir John Coryton had two other sisters, one of whom, Johanna, married John Peter, of Harlyn, Esq. The third sister married a gentleman of the name of Vaughan. In addition to the tales relative to Sir James Tillie's fu neral direction, Mr. Hals has added several others, all to this gentleman's disadvantage, but not in any way illustra tive of the times in which he lived, or of the general man ners prevalent in the country: they are therefore omitted, with the exception of one respecting armorial bearings. It is certain that Mr. Tillie was one of those persons, most justly esteemed, who advance themselves in the world without being beholden in any considerable degree to their ancestors. Mr. Tillie was knighted by King James II. and then not finding himself provided with a coat of arms, he assumed, as Mr. Hals states, the blazon of Count Tillie, a German Prince, which coming to the knowledge of Ring James, an inquisition was ordered, the fact was established, and a fine imposed on the knight, in addition to the demo lition of the assumed arms, with some acts of indignity. It is moreover proper to add, that although Sir James Tillie did without all question express some absurd fancies in respect to his mortal remains, which were in part exe cuted, yet they are far from bearing the colour of impiety cast on them by Mr. Hals, and still less are they charge able with the blasphemies imputed to them by Mr. Gilpin. The church and tower are plain on the outside, but within are several handsome monuments to the Corytons. It seems much more probable that this church is dedi-"], [181, "167 ST.

Bede has given various particulars of this eminent per son, and his life may be found in Capgrave's Aurea Le genda. He led a second body of missionaries in aid of the great St. Austin, and the conversion of a Pagan temple into a Christian church, since expanded into St. Paul's Ca thedral, and also the foundation of Westminster Abbey, are imputed to him. He departed this life on the 24th of April, in the year 624. St. Mellion measures 2410 statute acres.

Within the precincts of which lordship is situate the house and barton of Poole, so called after the English from the natural cir cumstances of the place ; where, by reason of the level or evenness of the town place, in winter season many lakes and pools of water stand. Of which place thus speaks Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall : \" Poole, for its lowe and moyst seate, is not unaptly named, houseth Sir Jona than Trelawny, far beneath his worth and callinge.

Ten-creek, Den-creek, in this parish, was formerly the lands and possessions of Richard Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, second son of King John ; who probably at some time lived at it (as also at his castle of Leskeard), for in the old dilapidated houses of this once famous fabric, I saw the ruins of a moorstone oven, about fourteen foot di ameter, in testimony of the hospitality once kept here. And moreover, in the front of the castlewise moorstone gate, or portal, I beheld his arms cut in stone; viz. within a bordure bezantee, a lion rampant crowned, whose arms in colours I think ought to be thus blazoned : ill port ung lyon rampant de Gowles, en Argent, bordure de Sable, talentee. Here groweth a sort of tree, bearing a strange sort of leaves and fruit, or berries, not seen in any other part of Cornwall, and therefore without name given it by me or others. Tre-havock, in this parish, Cornish Saxon, id est, the hawk town, was taxed in the Domesday Book, 1087, as the voke lands of k parish or manor which now is suitably called after the Cornish English Tre-hauke; for that it seems heretofore it was a place notable for keeping, mewing, or breeding hawks (or for that those lands were held by the tenure of paying hawks to its lord) ; from which place was denominated an old family of gen tlemen surnamed de Tre-hauke, who gave for their arms, in a field Sable, a chevron between three hawks. It is now in the possession of Peter Keckwich, Esq. descended from the Keckwiches of Catch- French, as they were from the Keckwiches of Essex ; who give for their arms, Ar gent, two lions in bend passant Sable, cottised Gules."], [184, "170 MENHENIOT.

From Becket this place came by sale to Harris ; from Harris to Hamlyn ; from Hamlyn to Cole, now in posses sion thereof, who was steward to Francis Roberts, Esq. and got riches in the service of the Earl of Radnor. Tre-wint, in this parish, id est, the spring or well town, is the dwelling of Thomas Kelly, Gent. Dr. John Moorman, Vicar of this church, was the first minister in Cornwall that said or taught the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the Creed in the English tongue. (See Feock and Creed.) He also catechised the children therein ; which I judge was in the latter end of King Henry the Eighth's, or the beginning of King Ed ward the Sixth's reign, 1549; for then by proclamation were called in all books of the Latin service for churches ; and the Bishops commanded in their several dioceses that forthwith should be warned, all prebendaries of their ca thedral churches, all parsons, vicars, curates, and the church wardens of every parish within their dioceses, to bring in and deliver up particularly. In this parish was formerly extant a hospital for lepers, that had competent lands and revenues. TONKIN. Pool, adjoining to the church town, was the seat of the Trelawnys, and their chief dwelling for many generations, till they fixed at their present one of Trelawen, in the parish of Pelynt. The chief manor in this parish is called Menheniot, or Tregelly."], [185, "171 MENHENIOT. THE EDITOR. The church of this large and opulent parish is of size proportioned to it, having three large aisles. The tower is low and surmounted by a spire. In the church are some monuments, but not of much antiquity. Archbishop Courtenay appears to have settled the right of presentation to this parish, by giving it to the Chapter of Exeter, with the limitation of their always bestowing it on some one who is at the time, or has been, a Fellow of Exeter College. The vicarage is endowed with the great tithes, on a payment of \u00a3 20 a year to Exeter College, and it is therefore considered as a rectory. Mr. Carew observes (p. 277, Lord de Dunstanville's edition) that this parish has been successively graced with three well born and well educated incumbents, Doctor Tremayne, Master Billett, and Master Dennis ; and it is believed that Wil liam of Wykeham held this preferment for some time pre viously to Archbishop Courtenay's endowment. The late incumbent, the Reverend WTilliam Holwell, may be noticed for his taste and skill in the fine arts. He was the son of a medical practitioner at Exeter, and nephew of William Holwell, student and tutor of Christ Church soon after the middle of the last century, and then Vicar of Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, where he died in 1798, having distinguished himself by the following, among other works : The Beauties of Homer, selected from the Iliad, 8vo. Extracts from Pope's Translations of Homer compared with the Beauties of the Original. 8vo. A Mythological, Etymological, and Historical Dic tionary. 8vo. Mr. William Holwell, the nephew, was of course a Fel low of Exeter College. He travelled through France and Italy about the year 1780, where he began forming a col lection of pictures, bequeathed on his decease to the Na-"], [186, "172 MENHENIOT. tional Gallery. He is said to have taken Orders with some reluctance, for the purpose of accepting this valuable living. But the most important event in this gentleman's life was his marrying Charlotte, daughter and heiress of James Carr, Earl of Erroll. He in consequence assumed the name of Carr. He died in the year 1830, having survived his wife nearly twenty years, who has a monument to her memory in Menheniot church. In the valuation of Pope Nicholas, the name of this parish is written Manyhinyhet, or Saihinet, proofs of the small reliance that can be placed on mere phonic etymo logies. Cartuther, noticed by Mr. Hals, became the property and the residence of the Morsheads, but having been sold, with all the other possessions of that family, it was pur chased by Mr. Kekewich. Mr. Lysons gives a detail of other manors and bartons of little interest. This parish has the reputation of being the most fertile of corn, especially of wheat, in the whole county. The aspect of the church town gives a strong impression of monastic remains, but there is not any tradition on record of a religious establishment in the place. Menheniot measures 6047 statute acres.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. The southern part of this parish is bounded by the hill of Clicker Tor, which is entirely composed of a dark com pact serpentine, abounding in steatite, asbestos, tremolite, and other magnesian minerals. The occurrence of this"], [187, "173 MENHENIOT. large mass of serpentine, amidst an extensive tract of rocks belonging to the calcareous series, imparts no little geolo gical interest to this parish, which deserves therefore to be more minutely examined ; for the cursory observations hitherto published have not satisfactorily developed the connection of this serpentine with the adjoining rocks. In crossing the parish from north to south, the rocks are first seen to consist of compact felspar and hornblend, re sembling those at Rosecradook in St. Clear ; next they become more schistose, and the hornblend forms only the colouring material, as it does on the north of Leskeard town ; at Pengover the hornblend again abounds, and is intermixed with calcareous spar, as in the vicinity of St. Ives. Approaching the church of Menheniot, the rocks again put on the appearance of a true hornblend schist, and this is succeeded by the serpentine of Clicker Tor. THE EDITOR. Not only is the serpentine of the Lizard found at Clicker Tor, but the plant also indicative of that formation, the great ornament of our southern promontory, the Errica Vagans, the multiflora of Hudson and Ray, and the di- dyma of Withering. Nothing seems to be more extraor- dinary, nor what, independently of experience, would be more unexpected, than the existence of the same rare plants at distant and unconnected places, where the peculiarities of soil and climate happen to agree; but to increase the wonder still further, even this diffusion has its limits. The southern hemisphere is said not to be decorated by a single wild rose, the Avavaa AvQwv of the northern world. And the whole continent of America is believed not to pro duce a single heath. Our preconceptions of what would be fitting for intelli gences superior to our own, and a fortiori as to what might be expected from infinite wisdom and power, have been"], [188, "174 MENHENIOT. established beyond the shadow of a doubt by Sir Isaac Newton, in respect to the great bodies moving in our uni verse. They perform all their revolutions in obedience to the simple and general laws of gravity and inertia ; and the rapidly progressive discoveries of each succeeding year, establish the same principle respecting causes acting con formably to general laws in the internal construction, pre servation, and renovation of our planet; and we are more over induced to believe that a like system must prevail in the moral world, not from analogy alone, but from a deep conviction that such a plan, and no other, can re concile the existence of partial evil with universal good: and thus conciliate the actual state of things with the at tributes of unlimited goodness, wisdom, and power; but in respect to animal and vegetable life, although an arrange ment as plain and as demonstrative of infinite wisdom may exist, it is, in the actual state of our knowledge, utterly hidden from our view. Thousands of distinct species or genera have ceased to exist, and their remains, varying from the most gigantic skeletons to objects suited for a microscope, are daily brought under our view \u2014 animals and plants have succeeded each other in the various geo logical periods, tending in succession towards more elabo rate construction and greater general perfection ; but not a trace is laid before us of the plan by which this beautiful system is arranged; our ignorance compels us therefore to suppose the immediate agency of the Divinity itself, when a plant indigenous to an old formation appears on one more recently elevated to the surface ; or when any of the innumerable changes take place in an organized inhabitant of this or of some other plant."], [189, "175 ST. MERRAN, MERIN, or MER-YN. HALS. Mer-in or Mer-yn, is situated in the hundred of Pedyr, and hath upon the north the Irish sea, west St. Evall, south St. Ervyn, north-east Padstow. In the Domesday Book this district was taxed by the name of Trevoes or Trevose, id est, the maid or virgin's town ; then and now the voke lands of a manor annexed to Pawton, or Polton, (parcel of the lands of the Prior of Bodman and Bishop of Exon before the Norman Conquest,) on the confines of which, towards the sea, is yet extant the ruins of an old church, chapel, and cemetery pertaining thereto, dedicated to St. Constantine, the first Christian Emperor of Rome : which, upon the encroachment of the sea-sand on the marsh beneath, which surrounded and over whelmed the same, was discontinued, and thereby gave occasion to the inhabitants to build their now church of Merin in a more secure place, further up in the country from the sea and sand, and moor or marsh ground ; the church of St. Constantine being in part converted now to a dwelling house for poor people. Near this church is yet extant St. Constantine's Well, strong built of stone and arched over ; on the inner part hereof are places or seats for people to sit and wash them selves in the streams thereof; the consequence of which facts, if the inhabitants may be credited, is not only very refreshing and salubrious, but, if it be dry weather, imme diately showers of rain will follow. The barton of Trevose is now, by lease, in possession of Gregory Peter, Esq. and Lawrence Growden, that well known Quaker, the reversionary fee pertaining to Sir Ni cholas Morice, Baronet, as parcel of his manor of Pawton; and is a large lofty promontory of land, shooting out far"], [190, "176 ST. MERRYN. into the Irish sea, beyond all other lands there, yet notable for its production of sheep, barley, and rabbits, and not altogether unprofitable for bullocks in winter season ; and as fatal and unfortunate for wrecking ships, that happen by night or stormy weather to fall on the rocks thereof, at that or any other time. Arel-yn, alias Har-lyn, in this parish. This barton is the dwelling of my very kind friend and brother-in-law, Gregory Peter, Esq. Sheriff of Cornwall part of the last year of William III. and first of Queen Anne, 1701; he married Elizabeth, daughter of Gove of Devon, the relict of William Wadland, merchant, by whom he had issue two sons, William and John ; William died without issue, and John that married Anne, the daughter of Sir John Coryton, of Newton, Baronet, by whom he hath a numerous issue of children of both sexes. After the death of the said Elizabeth, he married the daughter of Anthony Carveth, of Peransand, Gent, his cousin german removed, and hath issue by her Francis Peter. Gregory Peter aforesaid was the son of Thomas Peter, of Treater, in Padstow, Gent, who married the daughter and heir of Mitchell, lord of Harlyn ; the which Thomas Peter was the son of John Peter, of Trenaran, in Padstow, Gent, that married Toms, as John Peter was the son of John Peter of Trenaran, that married Kestell. Whether this surname of Peter be derived from the christian or font name of some of their ancestors, or from their being ancient inhabitants of Pedyrstowe, id est, Peter's dwelling, now Padstow, I cannot resolve. Their arms are in a field Gules, on a bend between two escallops Argent, two Cornish dawes Proper; much resembling the arms of the Lord Petre of Exeter, now of Essex. If this church of Merin, or Meran, were extant, it was not endowed with any revenues at the time of the Inquisi tion of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, since it is not named therein. And the five churches of Peran-sand, St. Agnes,"], [191, "177 ST. MERRYN. St. Colomb Minor, St. Breock, Lanhidrock, were then under the same circumstances. The tutelar guardian of this new church of Merin is St. Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose festival is duly celebrated by the inhabitants of this parish of Me ran on July the 7th, being commonly called his day, a hundred and twenty-two years after his death made a ca lendered Saint, who was slain at the altar in his cathedral church of Canterbury, the 30th of December 1172.

One Margaret Tregoweth, ofCrantock, temp.

[But who this Sanctus Meranus, or St. Meran, was I know not.] TONKIN. Mr. Tonkin does not add any thing to the history of this parish except the following assertion. This parish takes its name from a female patroness, Sancta Merina, so that the name should be written Merin. the editor. Mr. Tonkin has not given any information respecting St Merina, nor is any such name to be found. The barton of Harlyn, or Arlyn, belonged to the family of Tregewe ; from that family it passed by a marriage to the family of Michell, and with the heiress of Michell to Peter. Perthcothen, which belonged to the family of Tre vethen, is now the seat of another Mr. Peter. VOL. III. N"], [192, "178 ST. MERRYN. The manor of Trevose having formed a part of the very extensive property acquired by the Roberts's, was pur chased from them by the Morices of Werington, and in the division of property between the coheiresses of that family, it fell to the share of Molesworth of Pencarrow ; one part of it is held on lease by Mr. Peter, of Harlyn, and another belonged to the late Mr. Rawlings, of Pad stow. There is not any thing remarkable about the church. The stone in that immediate neighbourhood, at a place called Catacluse, is very favourable for building, and for ornamental work, as may be seen in the fonts at this church and at Padstow, and also in the ruins of the old church, dedicated to Constantine. The Editor has been favoured with the following com munication respecting this ancient building, by William Peter, Esq. of Harlyn. \" Constantine church is now in ruins, and the parish (if it ever was one) has been long merged in that of St. Merryn. The festival of Constantine is still celebrated by an annual hurling match, on which occasion the owner of Harlyn sup plies, and has (according to parish tradition) from time immemorial supplied, the silver ball. \" Adjoining the church of Constantine was a cottage which a family of the name of Edwards held for generations, under the proprietors of Harlyn, by the annual render of a pie, made of limpets, raisins, and various herbs, on the eve of the festival. This pie, as I have heard from my father and from more ancient members of the family, and from old servants, was excellent. The Edwards's had pur sued for centuries the occupation of shepherds on Harlyn and Constantine commons. The last died about forty years ago, and the wreck of their cottage is almost buried in sand.\" The font and the pillars of Constantine church are hand somely carved out of Catacluse stone, and Mr. Peter adds, that the font was transferred by his great-grandfather to St. Merryn Church, when it underwent a thorough repair."], [193, "179 ST. MERRYN. Under Catacluse Cliffs is a small pier, constructed by the late Mr. Peter for the shelter of coasting vessels and boats. The feast of Constantine is kept on the nearest Sunday to the 10th of March. The feast in honour of the comparatively modern Saint to whom St. Merryn Church is dedicated, is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to July the 7th, the Translation of St. Thomas of Canterbury (Becket). The great tithes belong to the Chapter of Exeter, and the Bishop collates to the vicarage. It has been remarked that three successive gentlemen of the name of Gurney held the living for above a century. The diversion of hurling, mentioned by Mr. Peter as taking place on the festival in honour of Constantine, is now wholly discontinued, or kept up on this particular oc casion as a mere remembrance of former times, when the manners of society were more adapted to such rude exer tions of activity and strength. For an account of hurling see Carew, p. 195, Lord Dunstanville's edition. St. Merran measures 3,644 statute acres.

The rocks of the southern part of this parish resemble those of St. Ervan, but near the church a lamelar blue slate prevails, like that of Endellion, and like it also abounding in veins of the sulphurets of lead and of anti mony. n 2"], [194, "180 MERTHYR. The western part of the parish, which extends into the sea, forming a promontory called Trevose Head, is com posed of crystalline rocks, which are massive, and differ from all the rocks that are interposed between it and the o-ranite of St. Dennis. Both the composition and the rela tive situation of these rocks are very interesting. They appear to be the equivalents of the masses of serpentine of Clicker Tor, and of tlie Lizard district ; of the felspathic rocks which form the downs between Launceston and Da vidstow; and of that curious mass of rock at King Arthur's Castle, in Tinta\u00b0el. Geologists have yet to learn the pre cise relation of these crystalline masses with the calcareous series in which they are situated. MERTHYR. HALS. Merthyr, Murder, vicarage, is situated in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north and east Probus and Tresilian river, south Lamoran and St. Michael Penkivell, west an arm of Falmouth Harbour, towards Clemens. As for the name, it refers to the tutelar patron and guardian saint of the church, who it seems was murdered and slain for the Christian religion, as a martyr ; viz. one St. Cohan, a Briton of this parish, whose little well, and consecrated chapel annexed thereto, was lately extant, upon the lands of Egles Merthyr barton, (that is to say upon the lands of the Martyr's Church,) though now in a manner demolished by greedy searchers for money. This church goes in presen tation and consolidation as a daughter to St. Probus, which vicar is to present the cu rate, vicar, or chaplain of Merthyr to the Bishop for li cence and confirmation ; though the eight men of the said parish are by ancient custom to choose and name him, in"], [195, "181 MERTHYR. consideration whereof the vicar of Probus is to receive an nually from them, on the high altar, three shillings and four pence. However, great controversies have happened in the Bishop's Consistory between the vicar of Probus and the inhabitants of this parish, before and since Henry the Eighth's days, upon the death, removal, or translations of the vicar of Probus, concerning the right of the jurisdiction, presentation, or patronage of this church ; whether in the vicar of Probus, or the eight men of the said parish, the vicar presenting one clerk or curate to be confirmed by the Bishop, and the eight men another ; but generally it hath passed as a rule in the Ecclesiastical Court, where this matter, by learned counsel or proctors, hath been debated, that the right of patronage and presentation of this church lay in the eight men of the parish, and not in the vicar of Probus, though the same hath been often controverted. There is a Latin deed which I have seen yet extant, be- tween Bar. Combe, vicar-general to Dr. Peter Courtenay, Lord Bishop of Exeter, 1480, under seal of the diocese, and John Fullford, perpetual vicar of Probus of the one part, and Thomas Tresithney, John Hallvose, Thomas Webber, and others of the eight men of the parish of Merthyr on the other part, wherein those premises are concerted or regulated ; and moreover, therein a confir- mation, covenant, or agreement, made and established be- tween them, according to ancient custom ; that in case the said eight men and their successois should annually pay to the vicar or curate of the said 'parish of St. Cohan Martyr, of Merthyr, for ever annually the full and just sum of twenty marks lawful moneys of England, that then the lands of the said parish, and every part and parcel thereof should be exempt and free from the payment of small tithes in kind, oblations, or obventions to the vicar thereof for ever. Which privilege hath ever since been kept and enjoyed by the inhabitants of the said parish accordingly ; to the great loss of the vicar, and greater gain of the inhabitants."], [196, "182 MERTHYR. Now, though when this compact was made and con firmed, the vicar had much the better bargain, not one vicarage church in Cornwall being of that value in the King's or Pope's Books towards Annats in the first inqui sition, 1294, nor many in Wolsey 's Inquisition, 1520; yet now the inhabitants have great profit thereby, since the plenty or commonness of money lessens the intrinsic value thereof, whereby much number of money will buy but little lands, goods, or chattels, whereas in those days a little quantity of money would purchase much of those things. (Witness Baker, and other our chronologers, temp. Henry VII. soon after the compact aforesaid was made, wherein we may read that a bushel of wheat, Winchester measure, was sold for 6c?., a bushel of salt for 3\u00a7<i., a ton of Gascoign wines 40s., and all other things sold after a pro portionable price.) In the Domesday Book, 1087, this district was taxed under the jurisdiction of Penkivell. Afterwards, upon the setting up the vicarage of Probus, it was concerted into that parish about the beginning of King Henry the Third's days; for in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, its superior or mother church was rated for it, as also the five chaplains for their salaries, that officiated in Probus, Cor nelly, and Merthyr. It was endowed by the treasurer of the cathedral church of Exeter, which must be after that dignitary was first set up there, by William Brewar, Bishop thereof 1224.

At Tre-saws-an, alias Tre-saus-an, id est, the Saxon town, or dwelling, a place heretofore pertaining to some Saxon, is the possession by lease of James Hals, Gent., granted him by his mother in the time of her widowhood, as parcel of the manor of Fentongollan, whereon she had power of leasing during her widowhood. He was a younger"], [197, "183 MERTHYR. son of Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollan, Knight, by Grace his wife, daughter of Sir John Arundell, of Tal verne, Knight; and was first bred a soldier in Pendenis Castle, whereof his father was Governor, under King James I. and Charles I. Afterwards he was made lieute nant of his brother Captain William Hals, in the expedi tion of the Duke of Buckingham in the French war, at the Isle of Rhe and Rochelle. And after that war was over was sent with his said brother by King Charles I. with a foot company of soldiers to supply or reinforce the garrisons of the Barbadoes, St. Christopher's, and Mountserat Islands in America, where he remained about seven years ; and after his brother's death, who died returning into England, Captain Ayleworth was displaced, and the said James Hals made Governor of Mountserat Island, by King- Charles I. After which, the wars breaking out in England, between that King and his Parliament, he and divers other officers were commanded to return back into England for the King's service ; where soon after his arrival at Plymouth, that stood for the Parliament, then besieged by the King's army, he was cajoled out of his allegiance to King Charles I. by his country gentlemen then in that place ir. garrison, and engaged against that King, to become Lieutenant- Colonel to Colonel Nicholas Boscawen's troop of horse, then posted there. From whence he was commanded, with several other troops of horse, to go outside the lines, under conduct of the Earl of Stamford, then Governor of Ply- mouth for the Parliament, and to fight the King's army that besieged it under conduct of Sir Ralph Hopton, Knight, and Sir Richard Grenvill, Knight and Baronet, the King's Generals in the West ; where, after a sharp engage- ment and loss of many men between both parties, the vic- tory fell to the King's army ; and then and there the said James Hals, and many other gentlemen were taken pri soners of war, and forthwith sent prisoners to Lidford"], [198, "184 MERTHYR. Castle in Devon, under custody of Marshall Ellery, of St. Colomb Major. Where soon after several of his companions, or fellow officers and soldiers, viz. Mr. Leach, Mr. Morris, Mr. Bra byn, and others, were executed without trial or judgment, as guilty of high treason. But the said James Hals had his life spared or given him by the General Sir Richard Grenville, Knight, upon account of consanguinity, but not without many frowns and angry threats ; (a sure token of his clemency, as his smiles and embraces were of death and destruction, suitable to those of King Richard III. and King James I. and Caius Caligula, Emperor of Rome,) to dissuade him from the Parliament service to that of the King's, with promise of greater preferment in his army ; all which proving ineffectual, he was sentenced a straight or close prisoner to that tremendous castle, in daily expecta- tion of death; where he remained immured up for about twenty months space, in great want, durance, and misery, till General Essex came into those parts with the Parlia- ment army, and set at liberty him and other Lidford pri- soners, by Captain Braydon raised the siege of Plymouth, and sore distressed Hopton and Grenville in Cornwall. During the time of this James Hals' imprisonment in Lidford Castle, amongst others there came to visit him one Mr. Doctor William Brown, of Tavistock, who gave him a copy of rambling verses and observations he had made upon the borough and castle of Lidford, for his di version ; which verses, for want of the original, I find false and imperfectly set forth and printed in Mr. Prince's Worthies of Devon, therefore I have hereunder set it down verbatim from the Doctor's own copy, given Mr. Hals, viz.: I oft have heard of Lidford Lawe, They have a castle on a hill j 1 took it for some old windmill, How in the morn they hang and draw, And sit in judgment after ; At first I wondered at it much, The vanes blown off by weather ; To lie therein, one night 'tis gast, 'Twere better to be stoned or pressed, But since I find the matter such, As it deserves noe laughter.

(See Glover's Somer set, and Duverdier's History of the Swiss Cantons.) The same law was in force amongst the people of Ca rinthia, a country adjoining to the Alps and Italy on the south, and Styria on the north ; moreover, if upon the trial three days after the offender's execution, he appeared to be guilty, his body should be left so long to hang upon the gibbet, till his members rotted piecemeal from his body.

THE EDITOR. Trevilian bridge is the most remarkable spot in this parish. It is situated in a beautiful valley, with a fine stream navigable for barges from Falmouth, which conveys large quantities of limestone from Plymouth, and of coast sand dredged in Falmouth harbour. In consequence also of the new line of road, completed about four years ago from Bodmin, and therefore from London to Truro, through Ladock valley, the Earl of Fal mouth has made a private road to his own house, from the eastern end of this bridge, equal perhaps in beauty to any drive of an equal extent in the whole county. Some fairs are annually holden at this place, and it is recorded in history as the place where the treaty was agreed on for the surrender of the army of about five thousand men, com manded by Lord Hopton, then lying in Truro, to the troops of General Fairfax, on the Mth of March 1646.

Mena-guise-y vicarage is situated in the hundred of Powdei-, and hath upon the north St. Mewan, east St. Austell, south the British Channel, west Gurran. For the modern name it may be interpreted either the hill cus tom ; otherwise, Mena-gusseg, after the Welsh, is the hill and waves or surges of the sea. I know Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, (contrary to this etymology) tells us that this church is called Me naguisey from its two tutelar guardian Saints, Meny and Isey ; query who they are or were, for in the Agonal, or Legend, I can find no such Saints ; besides, in the Inqui sition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of benefices in Cornwall, 1294, Ecclesia de la Mor-ike, in decanatu de Powdre, (which must be this church) that is to say the church of the sea cove, lake, or creek place, is valued at 40s.

Penwarne in this parish heretofore, if not now, the voke lands of some manor, (as I take it still it is,) gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen, surnamed de Penwarne ; whose daughter and heir, together with her self, carried those lands to Cosowarth, by whose heiress it passed to Otwell Hill, Esq. that married Denham, de scended from the Hills of Lancashire ; who gave for his arms, Gules, a chevron between three garbs Ermine ; from whose heir it passed, by sale or descent, to John Carew, merchant, that married Hellman, who by her had issue only five daughters: 1. married to Lewis Tremayne, of Halligan, Esq. ; 2.

TONKIN. The church, which is a very indifferent low building, consists of a nave only, with one north aisle and a cross aisle to the south. There was formerly a square tower at the western end with three bells, which being something out of repair, they pulled it down in the rebellious times, and sold the bells, which turned (as all such sacrilegious actions ought to do) to the utter undoing of all those concerned in it ; there remaineth however one bell in that part of the tower which is standing, even in height with the roof of the church."], [206, "192 MEVAGISSEY. THE EDITOR. Mr. Tonkin has written much more on this parish than on most others, but the details relative to families, and to individuals long since forgotten, and never of any distinc tion, are quite uninteresting. Mr. Lysons has abridged it to the following effect, inter mixed with additions of his own. Tonkin says that Mevagissey, lately a poor fishing village, contained in his time two hundred houses ; that a pier had been constructed at the expense of the Trewolla family ; that it was the most convenient place on the coast for the pilchard fishery ; that on an average twelve thousand hogsheads were cured annually. The present number of houses is about 370. The eastern part of the town, which in old deeds is called Porthilly, belongs to the Hoblyns ; the middle part to the Grenvilles, of Stowe in Bucking hamshire, as parcel of the manor of Trelevan ; the western part is included in Mr. Tremayne's manor of Penwarne. Ships of 100 tons burden may ride securely in the pool. The fishing cove of Porthmellin is partly in this parish. The manor of Trelevan belonged for several generations to the family of Trewolla, of Trewolla in St. Goran. It was by them sold, about the year 1667, to Walter Vincent, Esq. of Truro, who in 1 680 was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer, but died on his way to London before he had been sworn into that high office. His grand son Nicholas Vincent, who died in 1726, mortgaged this estate, the manor of Tregavethan in Kenwyn, and the greater part of his property, to John Knight, Esq. of Gos field Hall in Essex. This gentleman's widow married Lord Nugent, whose only daughter and heiress carried the whole to the Grenvilles, now Dukes of Buckingham. The barton of Trelevan was successively the seat of the families of Croome and Stevens, as lessees under the Tre wollas. The Vincents, having bought in the lease, made it their residence ; and, after the decease of the last of the"], [207, "193 MEVAGISSEY. Vincent's, Mr. Tonkin resided there for some time, being the heir-at-law, but the property was too much incumbered for him to retain the freehold. The manor of Pentuan was the property and its bar ton the chief seat of the Pentires, after they removed from Pentire in Endellion. The heiress of Pentire married Roscarrock, from whom this estate passed by a marriage to the Darts, of Dart Ralph in Devonshire, who sold it lo Robarts, of Lanhidrock; and the last Earl of Radnor be queathed it to Mr. James Laroche, a merchant of Bristol, afterwards created a Baronet. This gentleman becoming insolvent, sold the manor, together with a large property scattered over Cornwall, to a friend, who soon afterwards dying restored the whole by his will ; but in a little while, and as it would seem with the intention of guarding against the possibility of a similar occurrence, the estate was sold a second time in parcels; when this manor of Pentire was purchased by the late Mr. Tremayne, of Heligon, and the barton, which was reserved by Mr. Dart when he sold the manor, has descended to Mr. Tremayne from that family. The manor of Penwarne belonged to an ancient family of that name. Vivian Penwarne, who died in the reign of Henry the Seventh, left three daughters, coheiresses, mar ried to Cosworth. Penhallow, and Penwarne, of Penwarne in Mawnan. The elder daughter inherited this manor, which passed in marriage with the heiress of Coswarth to Alan Hill, Esq. There is a monument in the church to his son Otwell Hill, of Penwarne ; after his death the estate passed to a nephew, Mr. John Carew, second son of Richard Carew, of Anthony, the Historian of Cornwall. Mr. John Carew distinguished himself at the siege of Ostend, in 1601, where he lost his right hand by a cannon ball. His only son John died in 1640, leaving five sisters, one of whom married Fortescue, in whom this property continued till within recent times : it is now, however, sold in lots. vol. m. o"], [208, "194 MEVAGISSEY. The barton of Trewincy, sometime a leasehold seat of the Sprys, is now a farmhouse, the property of Mr. Tre- mayne. The vicarage is endowed with the great tithes of about one third part of the parish. The remainder of the great tithes has gone with the manor of Treleven to the Grenvelles. The patronage of the vicarage belongs to the Edgcumbe family, of Mount Edgcumbe ; the whole were formerly ap propriated to the college of Glaseney at Penryn. Mevagissey is one of the principal stations for taking of pilchards by seine nets, if it is not the very first. The bay is sheltered, free from rocks, and of a depth which allows the leads on one edge of the net to rest on the smooth sand at the bottom, while the other edge is raised to the surface by corks. All fish are by custom in this parish liable to tithes, which are payable to the vicar, and amount in some years to much more than the ordinary income of the living. The vicarage house is very pleasantly situated in a valley rising from the town, and the whole glebe received great improvements from the late vicar, Doctor Lyne, a gentle man of much respectability, but most distinguished by his singularities; among other fancies, he entertained such strong apprehensions and fear of contagion, as not to touch even gold coin till it had been flung into water ; but this caution seems to have been compensated by a subsequent attachment to the precious metal, as several thousand pounds in specie were found in his house.

Mr. Hals has given several etymologies of the word Ms wan, but so little probable as not to merit attention. It may be the name of a missionary, as is the case in so many other parishes. The church does not present any thing remarkable, ex cept a pleasing appearance among trees at a short distance north of the turnpike road leading from Truro to St. Austell, just where a hill has been lowered, and a valley raised within these few years, to the very great improve ment of the line of communication westward from Ply mouth.

His grandson now at the head of that ancient family."], [211, "197 ST. MEWAN. The object of most curiosity in this parish is Polgeoth mine, one of those wrought through the greatest length of time, and with the greatest produce of tin, in the whole county. Pol-gooth is in Cornish the old pit or mine. Mr. Hals mentions, as a matter of astonishment, its having pro duced above five hundred thousand pounds weight of tin in less than forty years, and that it paid a fifth dish or share to the proprietor of the soil. Nothing can more clearly evince the enlarged scale of working in modern times; 500,000 pounds weight of tin in forty years would give an average of 12,500 pounds weight for each year, and at the recent price of four pounds sterling for a hundred weight of tin, about \u00a32,200 a year. In some of the later workings perhaps thirty or forty thousand pounds have been expended in an outfit, or what is called bringing the mine into a course of working, in the purchase of steam engines, and of various other elaborate machines ; and in stead of paying a fifth part of whatever minerals are raised, free of expense to the proprietors of the soil, an eighteenth or perhaps a twenty-fourth share is all that can reasonably be demanded or afforded after such an outlay of capital, which small share, however, usually amounts to a greater value than did the fifth or sixth part received in former times. The manor and village of Burngullo belonged to the Robarts's, of Lanhidrock, and have descended to Mrs. Agar. . The manor of Trewoon belongs partly to the family of Hawkins, and partly to Tremayne and Hoblyn. St. Mewan measures 2,240 statute acres.

The northern part of this parish extends over the cen tral mass of granite, in the form of a long narrow stripe, the base of which is about one mile north of the church. All the remainder of the parish consists of compact and schistose felspar rocks, traversed by beds of porphyry, and intersected by numerous veins of tin and copper, more par ticularly of tin. On the whole, this parish bears a very close geological resemblance to St. Austell. See p. 401 of this Volume. ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. HALS. St. Michael Cary-hayes rectory, is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north Creed and St. Ewe, south the British Ocean, east Goran, west Verian. In the Domesday Tax, 1087, this parish was taxed under the names of Cari-crougi. At the time of the In quisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, this church was not endowed, if extant ; afterwards it was, by the Cornwalls, Hendowers, or Tregarthins, of Court in Branell, and de dicated to God in the name and honour of St. Michael the Archangel ; which gentlemen afterwards wholly impropri ated or appropriated their churches of St. Stephen's in Branell, and St. Denis, to the rector of this St. Michael Carhayes ; the patronage now in Tanner ; the incumbent"], [213, "199 ST.

Sheriff of Cornwall 17 Henry VII. 1503; Witte, or Sir William, Trevanion, knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall the 8th of Henry VIIL 1517; Hugh Trevanion, esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall 19 Henry VIIL ; Sir William Tre- vanion, knight, that married Edgcumbe, was Sheriff of Cornwall 23d of Henry VIIL He had issue Hugh Tre- vanion, esq.

Member of Parliament for Tregony, that married one of the coheirs of Sir William Drummond, knight, by the daughter and heir of Sir Nicholas Lower, of St. Wenow, knight; by whom he had issue John Trevanion, esq. twice chosen one of the Shire Knights for this county in Parliament, now living, that married Anne, daughter of Sir Francis Blake, knight. Charles Trevanion, esq. had also issue a son, educated beyond the seas, who entered into Holy Orders after the doctrine and discipline of Rome, as I am informed. The arms of these gentlemen are, in a field Argent, a sess Azure, charged with three escallops Or, between two chevronels Gules ; which arms I suppose heretofore were the arms of two distinct families, and for some peculiar reason united. TONKIN. This parish has its name from the Archangel, conjoined to that of the principal place in it. THE MANOR OF CARHAYES. The name of this place is derived from caer, a castle, a house, or dwelling, and hay a hazel hedge, as the situation does plainly make out; and did much more so before the great alterations which Mr. Trevanion hath lately made here. I have reason to believe that this place was part of Car minow's lands, and that it came into the Arundell family on the match with Jane, the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Carminow, in the reign of Edward the Third. Of this family, in recent times, Col. John Trevanion was killed in his father's lifetime, at the head of his regiment before Bristol, whose character may be seen in Clarendon. His father, Sir Charles Trevanion, was a very worthy honest gentieman, and suffered much for the king's cause, to the"], [215, "201 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. great detriment of his estate, and dying before the Restora tion, lived not long enough to have those amends made to his family, which his own merits and their losses deserved. Col. John Trevanion married Anne, daughter of John Arundell, of Trerice, esq. by whom he had a numerous issue, and among the rest Richard Trevanion, a famous sea commander, under King Charles the Second, and King James the Second, with which last he went to France, and died there in exile. The said Anne, his mother, was after wards remarried to Sir John Arundell, of Lanherne, by whom she had not any issue. Sir Charles Trevanion was succeeded by his grandson, of the same name, who first married the daughter and coheir of Sir Adam Drummond, by the heiress of the Lowers of St. Winnow, and had two sons. He died on the night of the great storm, Nov. 26, 1703 ; being succeeded by his eldest son, John Trevanion, who first married Anne, one of the daughters and coheirs of Sir Francis Blake, of Ford Castle in Northumberland, by whom he had no issue ; and secondly Barbara, the daughter of William Lord Berkeley of Stratton, by whom he has one son William, and two daughters, all very young. Mr. John Trevanion has been three times elected knight of the shire for this county, in the 9th and 12th of Queen Ann, and in the 1st of King George the First. O o He has bestowed a great deal of money in buildings, gardens, &c. on this place ; but as there is nothing of regu larity observed, it may more properly be called a pleasant romantic seat than a complete habitation ; and although it faces the south, yet it lies too much under an hill, and is therefore cold and damp in winter. The house anciently stood to the north of the present, towards the brow of the hill, according to my opinion in a far better situation. The place where it was built is still called the bailer, that is the hall ; but the odd desire of our ancestors to settle in our vallies, and to get, as they called it, in the luthe, in clined one of the Arundells to remove the house to where"], [216, "202 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. it now stands, and that was done so long since that nothing remains but the name to point out this ancient dwelling. Trevanion, formerly written Trevagnion, that is, the town or dwelling in an hollow, gave name and was the ancient inheritance of this very eminent family, which they left on their marriage with Arundell 's heiress, for Car hayes. The house at Trevanion is now so wholly de stroyed, that it would be hard to guess where it stood, had not the footsteps of two or three ways leading towards it pointed out the former situation. The park is at this place, and not at Carhayes, being well wooded, and having a fine river flowing through it. A portion of the park is in the parish of Gorran, called by the name of Porown Berry, and paying a quit-rent to the duchy manor of Tre vennen, out of which it plainly appears to have been taken. Hurris, or Herys, was formerly the seat of a knightly family, of which family I believe was Henricus de Herys, mentioned by Carew to have held a knight's fee in the reign of Richard the First. Near to this place is Treberrick, the fruitful or fertile town. Treberrick in this parish (for there is another place of the same name in St. Ewe) carries with it not only the advowson of St. Michael Carhayes, but also of St. Stephen's, and St. Dennis in Branwell. It was sold by John Tanner, esq. to Charles Trevanion, of Carhayes. This place is now the seat, under lease, of Simon Slade, gent, a younger brother of the late Mr. William Slade, of Trevennen. Mr. Simon Slade was twice married, first to one of the daughters of Mr. Thomas Hancock, of Pengelly in Creed, and not having any surviving children, he mar ried secondly the daughter of Stephen Thomas, of Trega mena in Verian, gent, by whom he has two sons and two daughters. The church is but small : being seated however on a hill, it is a good sea mark. This church consists of a nave, a south aisle extending about half its length, a north cross aisle, and a small confessionary to the north of the chancel."], [217, "ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES 203 The tower is low and without pinnacles, provided with three bells. A broken flat stone in the chancel has this inscription round its margin : Here lyeth the bodie of Mr. Zacharie Hooker, of this parish rector, who was buried ye xxv day of Nov. 1643. On the middle of the stone, Si genus aut nomen qu\u00e6ras, insignia monstrant : Si vitam, aut mortem, sat pia facta docent. Non opus est tumulo, cujus tot viva sepulchra Commemorant meritum, terra quot ora tenet. At the end of the verses is an achievement, containing the arms of Hooker, with several quarterings. THE EDITOR. The ancient and respectable family of Trevanion, like all others able to trace themselves back, in influential situa tions, to remote periods, has experienced the vicissitudes arising from civil dissensions. In those times it is quite clear, that love of plunder, and eagerness after confisca tions, must have been the sole motives of action on either side ; since, trifling as have been the causes of domestic as well as of foreign wars, no one can believe that, in the ab sence of all contested political principles, men could be found who would deluge their country with blood for the sake of seating on the throne an individual whose name was Edward instead of another designated as Henry, on the frivolous pretence, that, had England been a farm, and its inhabitants farm stock, one of the parties possessed a claim through females superior to the other, if it were not defeated by legal fiction, or by the lapse of time. In such a conflict three families at the least from Corn wall were engaged, Bodrigan, Trevanion, and Edge cumbe ; and when Richard the Third obtained sovereign power, on the division which then look place in the York"], [218, "204 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. faction, Bodrigan endeavoured to seize the property of Edgcumbe, with little respect, as it would seem, for the life of the possessor ; but in the final struggle at Bosworth Field, where Henry Tudor put an entire end to this con test for power under the guise of property, by seizing the whole to himself, Trevanion and Edgcumbe had the good fortune to appear on the winning side, and subse quently availed themselves to the utmost of belligerent rights against Bodrigan, as he had attempted to do before against them. The last of that family was driven from his home, and seems to have perished in exile. His property was divided between the two families opposed to him, and after the lapse of three hundred and fifty years continues to form a large portion of their respective possessions. At a subsequent period, when wars were levied in sup port of principles, and when men of honour and of virtue engaged on either side, as their early prejudices, investiga tions, or accidental experience induced them to believe that one or the other would prove most conducive to the public good \u2014 the Trevanions were less successful. They asserted their conviction in arms, that the country would be best go verned by concentrating hereditary power in a single man \u2022 and Mr. John Trevanion, bearing a Colonel's commission, shared in the military glories of the western army, and fell under the walls of Bristol. His father experienced the mitigated fate of those who were vanquished in this contest, by compounding for his estate ; and when, after a long in terval, his friends came again into power, and succeeded in placing at the head of affairs the son of their former chief, those immediately surrounding the seat of govern ment possessed but slender means, and still less inclination, to risk their own safety by indemnifying those at a distance, who had suffered in the Good Old Cause. The grandson obtained however the popular reward of representing Cornwall in parliament ; and the Editor has in his possesssion a letter addressed by Mr. John Treva nion to his great uncle Mr. Henry Davies, a hundred and"], [219, "205 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. twenty-five years ago, declaring his readiness to spend his fortune and to shed his blood, as his ancestors had done, in support of the same cause. This gentleman died in 1740, leaving William Trevanion his son and heir, and two daughters, the eldest of whom married John Bettesworth, LL.D. Dean of the Arches, and the younger married Ad miral John Byron, well known in his younger days by a narrative of the disastrous expedition of the Wager Store ship, commanded by Captain Cheep, as a part of the fleet conducted by Commodore Anson round the promontory of South America, in the year 1740, and of his own adven tures after the ship was wrecked on the coast of Patagonia, the dead reckoning giving them an erroneous longitude of fifteen degrees to the west, till his return in 1746. Ad miral Byron is now better known as grandfather to the most popular of recent poets. William Trevanion served in parliament for the borough of Tregoney, and died in 1767 without children, when the male line of this family became extinct. He was suc ceeded by Mr. John Bettesworth, his sister's son, and his son John Trevanion Purnel Bettesworth Trevanion, esq. is now the possessor of Carhayes, where he has substituted a magnificent gothic castle, after a plan of Nash, the ar chitect of Buckingham Palace and of Regent Street, for the house described by Mr. Tonkin. Mr. Trevanion married early in life, and was left a widower with several children. He has for his second wife Miss Burdett, daughter of the individual to whom the country mainly owes the great alteration in the constitu tion of its government, on the ultimate effects of which no one is yet qualified to form even a conjecture, still less an opinion. The family of Bettesworth have been settled on the manor of Fyning, a part of Rogate parish in Sussex, since about the year 1570 ; and a pedigree of nine descents is given in Dallaway's History of the Rape of Chichester, ending with Thomas Bettesworth, who assumed the name"], [220, "206 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. of Bilson in 1740, and died in 1754, aged 58. This gen tleman bequeathed a life interest in his property to Thomas Bettesworth, of Chithurst, and after his decease gave it to Henry Legge, fourth son of William Legge, first Earl of Dartmouth, on condition of taking the name of Bilson. Mr. Henry Bilson Legge married Mary Stawel, daugh ter and heir of Edward Stawel, Lord Stawel, and was in consequence himself created Lord Stawel in 1760. They were succeeded by their son Henry Stawel Bilson Legge, who died in 1820. The parish of Rogate is situated between Petersfield and Midhurst, on the bank of a small river, which (after water ing Selborne, a name made familiar to every one by the admirable work of its vicar, Mr. White,) flows into the county of Sussex, and joining the Arun, finally reaches the sea through Arundale, a name mistaken by the Nor mans for that of a swallow. The manor of Fyning belonged to a monastery of Pre monstratensian Canons, founded at Dureford, an adjacent parish, about the year 1160, by Henry Hosatus, or Husey, and augmented three hundred years afterwards by Henry Guldeford. It was surrendered to King Henry the Eighth, by John Simpson, the last superior. Temporary grants were made of the lands, till they were finally bestowed in fee on Sir Edmund Merwyn, a gentleman of Sussex, from whose descendants they passed to the Bettesworths. In the church of St. Michael Carhayes are several mo numents to the Trevanions, and pieces of armour, the tro phies of former days ; also a sword, believed to have been the very one used by Sir Hugh Trevanion at Bosworth Field. Etymologies, deceptive at all times, become so in a ten fold degree when they are sought in the varying pronun ciations of an unwritten language. But car, caer, &c. are known (like Rocca in the Italian) to mean a fortress, a castellated house, a dwelling; and hay, running colloquially into hayes, is an enclosed fence or yard. Carhayes may"], [221, "207 ST. MICHAEL CARHAYES. therefore signify the castle surrounded by a basse court or enclosure. Although Carhayes is several miles detached from the two adjoining parishes of St. Stephen and St. Dennis, yet it forms with them one united benefice, purchased by Mr. Pitt, with the other Mahon property. This more than usually improper association cannot by possibility escape the attention of those, who are engaged in reforming such abuses as may have crept into our Church Establishment.

St. Michael Penkevil rectory is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north and east Merther and Lammoran, and is otherwise wholly encompassed with the sea arm of Falmouth harbour, that extends towards Tre gony, Truro, and Tresilian bridges.

This church of St. Michael was endowed by the Fenton gollans, or de Tregagos, lords of the manor of Fentongcl lan, upon whose lands it was built (out of which is since taken the manor of Tregothnan), who also at their own proper cost and charges, built the south chapel or aisle thereof, as a peculiar to them and their families, and obliged those lands for ever to repair the same, (both over and under) as they still do. Besides this they founded in this church a chantry, together with a convent house in the churchyard still extant, for the chanter's residence ; and endowed the same with competent lands for their sub sistence, to pray for the souls of them and their ancestors, that after death they might be delivered from the flames of purgatory, and transported into heaven ; now these funeral songs or offices for the dead are commonly called obits. By the statute 27 Henry VIII. also 1 Edward VI. all chantrys, colleges, free chapels and hospitals, were given to the king ; at which time John Carmenow, esq. obtained by gift or purchase the grant of this chantry from the crown, and annexed it, together with its lands and reve nues, to the manor of Fentongollan, out of which at first"], [223, "209 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. it was taken ; all of which at length John Hals, esq. lord of the manor, together with the patronage of this church, sold to Hugh Boscawen, esq. temp. Charles II. Fenton-gollan, Venton gollan, was and is the voke lands of a considerable manor, which heretofore comprehended the whole parishes of St. Michael Penkevil and Merther ; except the tenements of Penkevil], Tregothnan, (Trega nyan, Penhell, Eglesmerther, and some others,) now as above subdivided into the manors of Tregothnan and Fen tongollan ; which latter had heretofore upon its lands many large and commodious houses, as halls, parlours, and dining rooms, a notable tower and bell, three stories high, and a chapel adjoining thereto for divine service, and two large gatehouses at each end of the town, which fabric the writer hereof hath often seen in his youth, when his grand mother lived in it, and enjoyed the same lordship, together with the manor of Bohurro, alias St. Anthony, as her join ture or freehold for life. But now, alas! since her death, those lands have been sold and transferred to several persons by her son John Hals, and those houses are all pulled down, and the chief stones thereof carried to build the gates and houses of Tregothnan. This lordship, as I have been informed, soon after the Norman Conquest passed from the family from thence de nominated de Fentongollan, to that of Tregaga, or Tre saga aforesaid, who for many generations were gentlemen of great fame and wealth, and in all probability were so denominated from Tregaga, or Tregage, house and tower, or castle, yet extant at Ruan Lanyhorne. In the rector's chancel or chapel of this church is yet to be seen a marble tombstone, with this inscription on it : Here lieth the body of John Trembraze, Master of Art and Law, and sometime rector of this church, who de parted this life 12 November 1503, upon whose soul Jesus have mercy. Trembraze is a place in Leskeard parish. This church, as I said before, being a quarter cathedral VOL. III. P"], [224, "210 ST.

Now it is a doubtful question amongst the canonists whether the gossips to such bells may marry with each other afterwards by ca nonical law. (See also to this purpose Fox's Acts and Monuments, temp. Henry VIIL p. 84.) TONKIN. St. Michael Penkevil is in the hundred of Powder, and is surrounded to the west and south by branches of the river Fale. This parish hath the adjunct of Penkivell from Penki vell therein, although I should think it ought rather to have had that of Fentongollan, since that always, till of late, hath been the principal place in this parish, and the patronage of it belonged thereto. I shall therefore in the first place treat of the manor of Fentongollan. The name of this manor does not bear the meaning as-"], [225, "211 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. signed to it _y Mr. Carew, but it signifies the holy well. The Saint's well of the parish being on the barton. But note that a part of the barton, and the greater portion of the manor, are in the adjoining parish of Merthyr; but as the house is wholly in St. Michael Penkevil, this is the most proper parish wherein to treat of it. Fentongollan has been the seat of several considerable families ; the first that I meet with as lord of this place is John de Trejago, or Trejano, Sheriff of Cornwall in the time of Edward the Second, whose son Stephen Trejago left an only daughter Jane, married to John Trenoweth, of Trenoweth, in whose posterity it continued, and was their principal residence till about the middle of the reign of Edward the Fourth, when John Trenoweth, of this place, left four daughters and coheiresses. Philippa, married to John Carminow, who obtained with her this place. Maud, married to Thomas St. Aubyn, of Clowance Catherine, married to John Raynwood, and secondly to Edmund Stradling, of Dunlery. Margaret, to John Godolphin, of Godolphin; and be tween these his large inheritance was divided. But this lordship, with many adjacent estates, came en tire to Philippa, his eldest daughter and coheir, the wife of John Carminow, esq. whose posterity lived here in great splendour, and went by the name of the great Carminows. John Carminow, of Fentongollan, was Sheriff of Corn wall in the fifth year of Henry the Eighth. His son, Thomas Carminow, was a gallant courtier and gentleman of the privy chamber to the same king ; but his grandson, Oliver Carminow, put a final end to the greatness of his family, having squandered away a vast estate, no less it is said than eight thousand pounds a year of actual receipts, leaving two daughters coheirs to what remained. Ann, married to William Salter, of Devonshire. Margaret, to Philip Cole, also of Devonshire, who sold this lordship to one Mr. Holcomb, in the latter part of p 2"], [226, "212 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. Queen Elizabeth's reign. The Carminow family was, how ever, continued through George, younger brother to Oliver, who lived at Polmawgan, in St. Winnow, as his posterity did at Trehanick, in St. Teath, where the last male of this family died, in the reign of King Charles the Second. Mr. Holcomb sold this place in the reign of James the First to Sir Nicholas Hals, who resided here. His son John Hals, parted with it to Ezekiel Grosse, esq. whose daughter carried this, together with sixteen other manors, to the family of Buller, of Shillingham ; and Francis Bul ler sold it in King Charles the Second's reign to Hugh Boscawen, esq. who pulled down this noble old mansion, the lofty tower and fine chapel, and carried the stones to build his new house at Tregothnan, so that not a footstep is to be seen of this once magnificent place, and a poor farm-house is built for a tenant in its stead. Under Fentongollan is a passage or ferry boat to go to Truro, and likewise to Kea, which is called Mopas ; this place was formerly famous for oysters, which are now spoiled by the vessels that carry off the copper ore, which vessels, lying generally at this place, and pumping up the poisonous water from the ore, let in by leakage, have in fected them with a strong brassy taste, so that eating a few of them will make any one ill; and yet, what is very re markable, the oysters themselves grow large and fatten as well as ever. Adjoining to Fentongollan is Treganyan, which I take to be a contraction of Tre-gan-ythan, the fursy town on the downs: however, its present plight may be better. This was anciently the seat of the family of Sayer. To the south of Treganyan is the church town and rec tory house, and near to them is Tregothnan, which signi fies the old town in the valley, a name suitable to the situa tion of the old house, although not of the new one. This place was anciently the seat of a family of the same name, till Johanna, the daughter and heir of John Tregothnan, by her marriage in the 8th year of Edward the Third,"], [227, "213 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. 1334, with John Boscawen, of Boscawen Rose, in the parish of St. Burian, brought Tregothnan to this family, whose principal seat it hath been ever since, now just upon four hundred years ; who have greatly enriched themselves, as well as ennobled their blood, since that time, by marriages with the heiresses of Albalanda, Trenoweth, &c. and by matching themselves into the most eminent families of the county. By a bill indented, bearing date the 4th of July 20th of Henry the Seventh, Thomas Hobbs, clerk, witnesseth to have received for the king's use, of Richard Boscawen, esq. five pounds of lawful money, in full of his fine to be released from the dignity of Knight of the Bath, at the cre ation of Prince Henry. Sir John Arundell, of Trerice, knight, late Sheriff, ac knowledges to have received of Hugh Boscawen, esq. four marks of lawful money of England to their Majesties' use, for that he repaired not to the Queen's coronation to receive the honour of knighthood, dated January the 18th, the 1st and 2d of Philip and Mary. This is the gentleman said in \" the Bayliff of Blackmore,\" to have been a wise man, learned in the laws of the realm, who yet was outwitted, or rather cheated, by a family of Truro, of which he tells a long story. Hugh Boscawen, esq. was Sheriff of Cornwall the 10th of King Charles the First, and was grandson to the above Hugh Boscawen, through his eldest surviving son Nicholas Boscawen and Alice his wife, one of the daughters and co heirs of John Trevanion, of Tr_voster. THE EDITOR. Mr. Hals has very naturally been induced to give the history of this parish, particularly of Fentongollan, and of every one connected with it, at great length ; but he has done this in a manner so diffuse and incoherent, that the Editor has thought it expedient to omit nearly the whole,"], [228, "214 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. and to substitute a short abridgment made by Mr. Lysons from Hals and Tonkin, although this will include some re petition from the latter. LYSONS. The manor and barton of Penkevil belonged in the reign of Edward the First to the family of De Wen, from whom Hals supposes it passed in marriage to the Penkevils ; it is however quite as probable that the property remained in the same family, they assuming a new name from the place of their abode. This family, says Hals, flourished for several descents in a genteel degree, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when Penkevil was given or sold to George Courtenay, gent, whose great-grandson alienated it to Hender Molesworth, esq. by whom it was conveyed to Hugh Boscawen, esq. The manor of Fentongolland, which extends into the parish of Merther, is said to have belonged at an early period to a family of the same name, from whom it passed by a succession of female heirs, to the families of Trejago and Trenoweth. John Trenoweth, who died in 1497, left four daughters, coheirs. The eldest, Philippa, brought this manor to John Carminow, of Resprin, (a younger branch of the Carminows, of Carminow,) who became, in consequence of this match, as Mr. Hals says, \" more famous for his wealth than any other of his name or house, or than any other family in Cornwall.\" Thomas, son of this John Carminow, was gentleman of the privy chamber to King Henry the Eighth. Hals, speaking of the hospi tality of John Carminow, the grandson, says, \" That he kept open house for all comers and goers, drinkers, min strels, dancers, and what not, during Christmas time ; and that his usual allowances of provisions for these twelve davs were twelve fat bullocks, sixty statute bushels of wheat, thirty-six sheep, with hogs, lambs, and fowls of all sorts, and drink made of wheat and oat malt proportionable, for"], [229, "ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. 215 at that time barley malt was little known or used in those parts.\" Oliver Carminow, son of this John, is said to have squan dered away the greater part of his very valuable estates. He left two daughters, married to Salter and Cole, by whom this manor was sold, in the year 1600, to the Hol combes. Sir Nicholas Hals purchased this estate in 1603, and made Fentongollan his residence; his son sold it to Ezekiel Grosse, whose daughter and heiress brought this and several other estates to Francis Buller, Esq of Shil lingham. It was purchased of that family about the year 1676, by Hugh Boscawen, Esq. who soon afterwards pulled down the fine old mansion-house of the Carminows, with its lofty towers and chapel. A farm-house now occupies the site. Tregothnan, the seat of Lord Viscount Falmouth, came to the Boscawens in marriage with the heiress of Tregoth nan in the fourteenth century. Treganyan, or Tregonian, formerly the seat of a family bearing the same name, passed by successive female heirs to the Haleps and Sayers ; by bequest from the latter to Trevelyan ; and by a coheiress of Trevelyan to Rowe. It was purchased of the Rowes by Mr. George Simmons, who conveyed it to Lord Falmouth. The barton-house is now occupied by a farmer. ' Nancarrow, in this parish, was also the property of a family to whom it gave its name. The family of Boscawen is unquestionably of very great antiquity, of Norman or British origin, having either im parted their name to Boscawen Rose, in St. Burian, or received it from that place. The peninsula west of the Mount's Bay, little fre quented in former ages, and scarcely accessible to strangers, abounded, as all similar districts have been found to do, with long settled possessors of landed property ; who, con tent with the small fortunes transmitted from their ances-"], [230, "216 ST.

Such were the Boscawens, Vyvyans, Levelas, Trevilians, Noyes, and perhaps Usticks, Davieses, Kegwins, and some others, all inhabitants for centuries of this remote portion of Corn wall, and all arranged on similar scales of property and influence. The Boscawens however emerged in the four teenth century, and pursued with great perseverance and success the only path then leading to advancement in the world. They married heiress after heiress, and acquired extensive properties in various parts of the county. The Boscawens were among the few Cornish gentlemen in the western division, who took what may now be called the liberal side in the Civil WTar, and they continued to oppose the arbitrary principles of the faction, having at its head the two last brothers of the house of Stuart \u2014 and assisted in the glorious Revolution which secured us from civil and religious despotism, by placing the Prince of Orange on our vacant throne. Hugh Boscawen married Margaret Clinton, eventually coheiress of the Earl of Lincoln, by whom he had a nu merous family, all of whom died before him, with the ex ception of Bridget, married to Hugh Fortescue, ancestor of Earl Fortescue; and with this lady, Mr. Hals states that Mr. Boscawen gave lands and money to the value of a hundred thousand pounds; he died in 1701, and was suc ceeded by his relation of the same name. This gentleman is understood to have possessed very considerable talents, and powers of exerting them. He continued ably to support the Revolution government, and brought to it a powerful aid arising from the peculiar feature which distinguished Cornwall up to the year 1832. In 1714, on the German .accession, hopes, fears, expec tation, and party violence, burst forth with all the fury that had driven them into action thirty years before. Vigorous proceedings were therefore demanded, and may be justi fied by the exhortation at Salamis, Nu>* b-rrep iravruy Aywv."], [231, "217 ST. MICHAEL PENKEVIL. Yet in moments of cool reflection, and at the distance of a hundred and twenty years from this agitated period, one cannot refrain from thinking that Mr. Boscawen was carried beyond the limits of duty to his country, or zeal for his associates embarked in the same cause, when he under took and executed the task of arresting his countrymen, and probably his former friends, on the suspicion of their entertaining opinions more favourable than his own to monarchical power, and to what in modern phrase might perhaps be termed conservative principles. Sir Richard Vyvyan was seized at Trelowarren, conveyed by water to Pendennis Castle, and from thence to the Tower. Mr. Basset, of Tehidy, would also have been arrested if he had not left his house ; and other proceedings were taken of equal violence. These acts, however necessary at the time, produced their moral effects of creating feuds and permanent irrita tions, so that while the principal agent was admired by one party, and received the reward of an hereditary seat in parliament, as was industriously propagated, in return for these services, the opposite party detested his name, and usually joined to it an epithet drawn from the inferior apparitors of the common law. This gentleman, created Viscount Falmouth in 1720, married Charlotte, daughter and coheir of Charles God frey, Esq. and his wife Charlotte Churchill, sister of the great Duke of Marlborough. They had a very numerous family ; the eldest son, Hugh Boscawen, succeeded of course to his father's estate and hereditary seat in parlia ment; very little is remembered about him. He is be lieved to have been kind and benevolent in private life, and the Editor is anxious to avail himself of this opportu nity for acknowledging an act of generous and feeling liberality exercised by this gentleman to the benefit of a near relation, about fourscore years ago. In ability he probably fell much below the usual standard of his family, for he is known to have been cajoled into marrying a kept mistress; and idle tales are circulated of his mistaking vol. m. r 5"], [232, "218 ST.

It is probable these mistakes never literally happened, but such anecdotes are usually characteristic of the individual; if however they really were made, the credit of tbe family has been amply redeemed by a nephew, who has given to the public one of the best translations of Horace extant in any language. Of his various brothers very little also is known or re membered, excepting of one, and that one is Admiral Bos cawen, the glory not of Cornwall but of his country, the Nelson of his time. Edward Boscawen went early to sea, expecting (as the Editor has heard from one to whom he related the circum stances) to be advanced almost immediately through family interest and connection to the station of a Lieutenant; when the order was suddenly made for subjecting all mid shipmen to a .service of six years at the least. \" To this order,\" he was accustomed to say, \" I owe all my knowledge of seamanship, and to this order the British Fleet is mainly indebted for the superior knowledge and skill of its officers.\" The young man was properly advanced as occasions offered themselves; and from the period of his commanding a ship, his whole career was one of glory and of deserved success. Besides engagements with single ships, and their capture, his achievements are recorded at Porto Bello, Carthagena, Cape Finisterre, the East Indies, the Coast of Spain, and above all at Louisbourgh Harbour, in Cape Breton, where he effected a conquest most gallant in itself, and essential to the subjugation of Canada by General Wolfe ; and what may equal the spolia opima of Rome, he three times made M. Hoquart, the French commander, a prisoner in the course of one war. Admiral Boscawen was beloved throughout the navy for his care and attention to the health, the comfort, and the happiness of every one under his command, to as high a degree as he was admired for skill, for prudence, and for valour; throughout Cornwall he was adored. So that, not withstanding the rule observed in that county, of considering"], [233, "219 ST.

The general elec tion arising from the accession of George the Third was approaching, when a fever closed the life of this great man, on the 10th of January 1761, in the 50th year of his age. Admiral Boscawen married Frances, daughter of Wil liam Evelyn Glanville, a lady possessed of every quality that could .idorn the highest station, or that could render her amiable in domestic life. They had several children The eldest, called after his father's name, died at Spa in Germany, in early life, on the 17th of .luly 1774. The second son, William Glanville Boscawen, having engaged in the sea service, anxious to emulate the splendid example given by his father, and having become a Lieute nant, was most unfortunately drowned in Jamaica, on the 21st of April 1769. On this melancholy occasion the fol lowing elegy was composed by Doctor John Walcot. This gentleman was bred to the medical profession un under an uncle at Fowey, where he afterwards practised, hut standing high in the estimation of Sir William Tre lawny, appointed Governor of Jamaica, Doctor Walcot, provided with a medical degree, went out with him as his physician ; and in times when propriety and decorum were less attended to than at present, he was also admitted into holy orders, and thus became qualified for holding a living in the Island, one of which he actually obtained ; but having returned to England after the Governor's decease, he relin quished the preferment, which could not be held without residence, and abandoned the character of a clergyman.

On Fancy's ear shall swell the sigh By blooming virgins breath'd in vain, On Fancy's ear the knell shall die, That sadden'd all the weeping plain. Tho' forced from thee I wander far, Thy fate shall cloud my rising Morn *, And oft with Evening's silent star I '11 hover o'er thy distant urn.

Tregothnan, from its bold and elevated situation, com manding an extensive view, intersected by various branches of the Falmouth river, and of the harbour, from the abund ance of its trees and woods, and from the integrity of its surrounding property fenced in by natural boundaries, must be considered as the first gentleman's seat in Corn wall, with the exception perhaps of Mount Edgcumbe. The house standing there till within these few years, bore the appearance of considerable antiquity, and harmonized with the surrounding scenery ; the ruins of Fentongol lan could not have been used for building this house, as Mr. Hals relates : they may have supplied materials for repair, or for additional offices. The present proprietor has taken down the old house, and replaced it by a new one, that may compete with the best in England for real utility, and for decorations har monizing with its bold situation and surrounding landscape.

The church has a few monuments to the Lowers and others. The only village in this parish, in addition to the church town, is called Treveighan. Trevenin was a seat of some branch of the Lower family, now all extinct ; and Tregone, heretofore belonging to the Mayows, is now the property of Mr. Hockin. The advowson is in the Duke of Cornwall.

Robert de Cardinan, by a very ancient deed, without date, which I have seen, gave Crucgleu and Pengaer to Richard Dangeros and his heirs. This family, who by their matches seem to have been gentlemen of considerable note, continued at this place till the beginning of the reign of Henry the Fourth, when James Dangero left two daughters and coheirs : Margaret, married to David Renaudin, of Arwothal; and Isabella, married to Richard Bonithon, second son of Simon Bonithon, of Bonithon. This barton fell to the share of the said David Renaudin, but he and Margaret his wife dying without issue, their portion of the whole inheritance, said to be worth \u00a3500 per annum, came to Richard Bonithon and Isabella his wife. The last male descendant of this family, Richard Bonithon, esq. a very worthy gentleman, died July the 31st 1697, in the 45th year of his age, leaving by Honor his wife, daughter of Sir Thomas Heale, of Fleet, one daughter and heir, Jane, married to Samuel Kempe, oi\" Penryn, esq. ; which said Samuel Kempe died without issue, October the 20th 1728, leaving the said barton of Carclew, and some small part of the ancient lands, (for he had sold off tbe rest in his lifetime,) to his widow, who now resideth there; a lady who, for her many virtues, bounty, and other accomplishments, deserveth a much better fortune, in every respect, than she has had the luck to meet with.

It was formerly written Restrongas, and I take the sense of the word to be Res, Ros, Rose, a valley ; trong, a nose, used in the same sense as we use ness, from the French, for land jutting into the sea; and gas, or guys, deep ; so as to signify altogether, the valley with the deep promontory or point of land. Wil liam de Bodrigan was lord of this manor in the 12th of Henry the Fourth, And that family possessed it till the beginning of the reign of Henry the Seventh, when, on the attainder of Bodrigan, it was given to William Treva nion, in which family it still continues, John Trevanion, of Carhayes, Esq. being the present lord thereof. In the vil lage of Restronget have lived in lease for several genera tions a younger branch of the Leys of Ponacumb. There is a passing boat kept here, it being the post road, and by much the nearest cut from Falmouth to Truro and the east, called Restronget Passage. A part of the Bishop's manor of Penryn extends into this parish. MANOR OF TREFUSIS AND TREGOSE. Trefusis, saith the Editor of Camden, in the Additional Part, p. 22, signifies a walled town, or fortified place."], [241, "227 MYLOR, OR MILOR. This hath been the seat of an eminent family of the same name ever since the Conquest, if not before. The present possessor hereof is Robert Trefusis, Esq. a young gentle- man of great hopes, who is yet unmarried. These gentle men, led away by a false notion, (with many others) <}f being of French extraction, have given, in allusion to the supposed meaning of their name in the language of that country, for their arms, Argent, a chevron between three fusees, or wharrow spindles, Sable. The house is extremely pleasant by its situation, and would be much more so were it built a little higher up. To the south of the house is a fine grove, and a walk, at the end of which is a pleasure-house, built by this gentle man's father, from whence there is a very beautiful pros pect. Adjoining to Trefusis is Nankersy, that is the winding valley, from ceirsie, to twist or wind about. This place, by a lease from the Trefusises, has been for two or three generations the seat of a younger branch of the Littletons, of Lanhidrock; the late owner, William Littleton, Gent. died a bachelor in the year 1734, and by his decease the estate is fallen into the lord's hands. The arms of Little ton are Argent, a chevron between three escallops Sable. On this Nankersy hath been lately built by the Dutch- men a considerable town, called by them Flushing, after a town of the same name in Zealand, by which name it is now generally known. And had these Dutchmen had the continuing of this town, they would have made it in some measure to resemble its namesake, by digging a canal to discharge all sorts of merchandise through the middle of it, there being a large marsh adjoining, that seemed by nature to have been placed for that purpose ; but as it is, though there are some good houses here, the whole is without any order, contrivance, or regularity. The late Samuel Trefusis, Esq. was at no small expense in levelling the place, the buildings, quays, &c. for loading or unload ing the vessels ; and could he have settled the packet boats e 2"], [242, "228 MYLOR, OR MILOR. here, for which it lies far better than Falmouth, the water being deeper, and they all lying before it, Flushing would soon have been a place of great resort; but, having failed in that, the town is now falling to decay, and many of the houses of which it consists are uninhabited. THE MANOR OF MYLOR. A small lordship which takes its name from the parish, and in which the church is situated, so that probably the churchyard and the glebe were taken out of it by the gift of some former proprietor, although the fact is now for gotten. The present lord of this manor is Martin Lister Killigrew, Esq. an adopted heir to Sir Peter Killigrew. The church is situated at the south-east end of the parish, near that branch of Falmouth haven called Mylor pool. It is but a small building, consisting of a nave, one aisle of the same length, with a handsome north cross aisle, be longing to Carclew ; and a little distance from the west is a low square campanile covered with slate, in which are three bells. THE EDITOR. Mr. Tonkin seems to have fallen into an error respect ing the valuation of this living in the taxation of Pope Ni cholas ; which he says was \u00a36. 8s. id. But no name in the least degree resembling Milor, can be found under Kerrier hundred in the parliamentary publication of that record, nor is any parish rated at that sum. The church contains several monuments. The most in teresting is one of marble, placed there to the memory of her father, mother, and husband, by Jane, the heiress of the Bonithon family, and widow of Samuel Kempe, who built the house at Carclew, and died on the 20th of Octo ber 1728, in the 59th year of his age. There is also a monument to Francis Trefusis, who died in 1680, decorated by handsome sculpture. And one to"], [243, "229 MYLOR, OR MILOR. the memory of Edward Baynton Yescombe, esq. who fell while he was bravely defending the King George, Lisbon packet, against the enemy, in August 1803. And another executed by the celebrated artist Mr. Westmacott, to the memory of Reginald Cocks, youngest son of Charles Cocks, Lord Somers, and Anne his wife, sister of the late Mr. Re ginald Pole Carew. Carclew was devised by Jane Kempe to her relation Mr. James Bonithon, of Grampound, from whom it was pur chased by Mr. Lemon in 1749, who immediately began io finish the house, and to complete the whole as a family residence on the scale appropriate to every thing that he undertook. Here Mrs. Lemon resided after she became a widow, and here the family have resided ever since. Mr. and Mrs. Lemon had an only son William Lemon, who married Anne, daughter of Mr. John Willyams, of Carnan ton. Both died in early life, leaving three children. William, born Oct. 6, 1748, who succeeded his grandfa- ther in 1760, married Jane, daughter of James Buller, of Morvall, esq. was elected member of Penryn, on the decease of Mr. Francis Basset in 1769, and at the general election of 1774 succeeded in a contest to represent the county, which, universally esteemed and respected, he continued to do by ten subsequent unanimous elections, during a period of fifty years, up to his decease on the 11th of De- cember 1824. This gentleman was created a Baronet, and commanded for several years the county militia. John, the second son, became a colonel in the army, commanded the militia of Cornish Miners, served in par- liament for the borough of Saltash, and four times for Truro. He died unmarried in 1814, at Polvellan, a place that he had created with great taste on the southern side of the lake, loch, or loo, formed by the two rivers above East and West Looe, and close on the margin of a large salt water pond, made to retain the sea water at high tide, af terwards to give motion to the machinery of grist mills,"], [244, "230 MYLOR, OR MILOR. from whence Mr. Lemon named his new place Pol-Vellan, in Cornish the mill-pool. Colonel Lemon was such a proficient in music as to perform extemporaneous voluntaries ; and several psalm tunes and chants of his composition have been printed. Anna Lemon, the sister, married Mr. John Buller, of Morval. Sir William Lemon greatly improved Carclew, and added most materially to the extent of the property round his seat, by purchasing from Mr. Trefusis the manor of Restronget, which had been acquired some years before from Mr. Trevanion. He is most worthily succeeded by his son Sir Charles Lemon, now member for the county, to whom the house at Carclew is indebted for still further improvements made in the best taste; the grounds and gardens have also been enlarged and beautified, and further arrangements and other decorations are still in progress. It is a very curious cir cumstance that several acres of ground at Carclew have been recently found covered with the eria ciliaris, not known before as an English plant. Of his eight sisters three have married Cornish gen tlemen. Harriet, married to the late Lord de Dun stanville. Caroline, to John Heale Tremayne, esq. late member for the county. Jane, to her double cousin-ger man Mr. Anthony Buller, Barrister-at-law, and knighted on his going to India as a judge. The family of Trefusis can now scarcely be considered as connected with Cornwall, Robert George William Trefusis having succeeded, on the death of George Wal pole, Earl of Orford, to the barony in fee of Clinton, cre ated by writ of summons in the year 1299, the 28th of Edward the First, and under a deed of settlement, made by the same Lord Orford, having succeeded also to a very large estate, chiefly in Devonshire; and finally, in conse quence of their having alienated by far the greater part of their possessions in this county."], [245, "231 MYLOR, OR MILOR. This gentleman having married Marianne Gaulis, a lady of Switzerland, and died in 1797, has been succeeded by his son Robert Cotton St. John Trefusis. He married one of the daughters of William Stephen Poyntz, Esq. and niece of Mark Anthony Browne, last Lord Montague, of Cowdray Castle, in Sussex; but having died without issue, he is succeeded by his brother Charles Trefusis. The widow is recently married again to Colonel Horace Seymour. The situation of Trefusis is very beautiful, the whole jutting into Falmouth harbour, with Penryn river on the south and Milor river to the north. Mr. Tonkin has given a picture of Flushing, very far from corresponding with its present features : instead of falling into decay it has grown up to be an elegant town, although the packet station has not been fixed there, nor is it in all probability suited to that purpose. If the word Gas, or Guys, which Mr. Tonkin says means deep in Cornish, should also, as in some other lan guages, bear the correlative sense of lofty, his explanation of Restronget would be more complete.

Near the church are some ruins still to be seen of a mo nastic establishment, said by Mr. Lysons, on the authority of Doctor William Borlase's manuscript collections, to have been a priory of Black Monks called Minster, or Tol carne, founded by William de Botreaux, as a cell to Ty wardreth, itself subject to the abbey of St. Sergius and Bacchus, in Angiers. Tywardreth, however, after having been seized into the King's hands, as an alien priory, was made independent and denizen, and continued till the general dissolution by Henry the Eighth. Probably there fore Minster remained as a parcel of Tywardreth up to the same eventful period. Tanner, however, calls it merely an alien priory to the abbey of St. Sergius and Bacchus at Angiers, without any notice of Tywardreth. In Dugdale's Monasticon is the following addition to"], [247, "233 MINSTER. Tanner : Minster Prior, alienigena habet in proprios usus Ecclesias de Minster et Bodecastell ; and in a note there is a reference to muniments in Exeter Cathedral, and to MS. collections in the British Museum, vol. XL. p. 39, for a resignation of this priory by the abbot and convent de Valle, or Vale Royal, in Cheshire ; from which it would seem that this house was not restored to Tywardreth after the sequestration of both. The manor of Pollifont, in Lewannick, (see that parish) which formerly belonged to this priory, is now an append age to the living, so that the rector of Minster is lord of the manor of Pollifont; and the customs of the manor are said to be, that on the accession of a new rector, after the decease of the former, but not otherwise, the tenants pay him thirty pounds and one penny, raised according to some ancient schedule among themselves. Several small fees are due on surrenders and on admis sions at the manor courts, and on the death of each tenant a heriot becomes due to the lord, which is either his best beast or six guineas, and in addition to these, there is an annual payment of four pounds. Minster church lies in a deep valley, surrounded by trees, giving the strongest impression of its forming the quire of a sequestered monastery. It contains several mo numents to the Henders, Cottons, 8tc. One has a Latin inscription, with the curious pedantic device of certain let ters standing prominent among others in the different words, and indicating, as Roman numerals, the various dates. Four lines on William Cotton, son of William Cotton who held the see of Exeter from 1598 to 1621, and on Elizabeth his wife, daughter and coheir of John Hender, have been frequently transcribed, on account of their ex treme simplicity : Forty-nine years they lived man and wife, And what 's more rare, thus many without strife, She first departing, he a few weeks tried To live without her, could not \u2014 and so died."], [248, "234 MINSTER. This church is one of the very few in Cornwall that want the decoration of a tower, and strange legends are circulated to account for this defect, probably of a more ancient date than the Reformation. The bells are said to have arrived in a vessel almost to the spot where they would have been landed, when an expression of the captain, im- plying confidence in the powers which God had given him, construed into blasphemy by Anthopomophites of all re- lio-ions, is supposed to have caused the immediate destruc- tion of the ship, with every one on board ; but when the ground seas roll with their accustomed violence on this iron-bound coast, the bells are still fancied not only to ring a peal, but to indicate by particular sounds the cause of this reputed miracle, intended to convince mankind that they are bound to neglect and to render vain what ever gifts the Almighty may have bestowed on them, and thanklessly to employ their time in imploring more. This place was in feudal times the residence of a baro nial family, bearing the name of Botreaux, which they im parted to a manor, or, as the Court Rolls would testify, to an honor, having manors dependent, and enclosing the town of Botreaux Castle, dignified by the appellation of a borough ; a term, it may be observed, that had not in ancient times any reference to the privilege of sending members to parliament. Mr. Lysons says, that William Lord Botreaux, the last of this family, fell in the second battle of St. Alban's, leav ing an only daughter, married to Sir Robert Hungerford. The honour of Botreaux, and the manor of Worthyvale, went with the heiress of Hungerford to the family of Has tings, by whom this property was sold to John Hender, esq. in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. John Hender appears to have had four daughters and coheiresses : Katharine, married to John Molesworth ; Frances, to Richard Robarts, of Truro ; Mary, to Ellis Heale, of Devonshire ; and Elizabeth, to William Cotton, son of the Bishop ; Boscastle and Worthyvale came as a portion to the last."], [249, "MINSTER. 235 Sir John Cotton, probably the grandson of William Cotton, resided here, and died in 1703, without a family; he gave the property to his sister's son, Mr. Amy, Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1714, whose father had the livinc* of Minster. His son, Cotton Amy, esq. married one of the two daughters and coheiresses of Samuel Gilbert, of Tackbear, in Bridgerule, and had two daughters : Grace, married to Mr. Jonathan Phillipps, of Camelford, a Captain in the Cornwall Militia. This lady had several children, who all died at early ages ; and her sister never married, having continued in a state of derangement at Botreaux Castle for many years. Sir Jonathan Phillipps (for he had been knighted on the occasion of presenting an address from Camelford, when a female offering a petition to King George the Third, was observed to have a knife in her hand,) left his share of this property, with the remainder of his own estate, to Mr. Thomas Winslow, the son of his sister, on his taking the name of Phillipps, which he did, and was suc ceeded by his son, who now resides at Landue, in Lezant, but having purchased that place and lands about it, Mr. Phillipps has parted with much of the estate at Botreaux Castle to Mr. Avery, a gentleman who carries on a very considerable trade there, and seems likely to raise the place into greater opulence and importance than it can have experienced since the fall of its feud.al grandeur. An elevated piece of ground, rendered steep by artificial scarping, is pointed out as the site of the castle, which gave a termination to the honour of Botreaux. This castle had, however, disappeared before the time of Carew ; and the dwelling of Sir John Cotton, probably constructed after the cp -tie had become a ruin, which used to be called The Great House, was scarcely habitable fifty years ago, and has now disappeared. The port of Botreaux Castle admits coasting vessels in fine weather, and considerable trade is carried on there by exporting the excellent slatestone with which that neigh bourhood abounds, and by importing coal and lime, in ad-"], [250, "236 MINSTER. dition to such articles of commerce as the adjacent country may require. It is generally believed that the harbour might be ren dered safe and commodious for a sum much within the limits of private expenditure. Ponderous articles might be raised to any required level by the power of water wheels, and from the summit of the acclivity, a flat plain extends to the distance of many miles inland ; so that a possibility at the least seems to exist, of Botreaux Castle becoming the site of an extensive commerce\". The advowson of the living belongs jointly to Mr. Thomas John Phillipps, representative through his great uncle of Miss Grace Amy, and the representatives of her sister. The late incumbent was the Rev. R. Winsloe, uncle to Mr. Phillipps. The manor of WTorthyvale was sold to Mr. Hugh Bos cawen in the early part of the last century, and was used as a hunting seat ; it has again been sold by one of his descendants, and it belonged some years since to a gentle man of the name of Farnham. The single stone laid over a stream, having some letters cut on its lower surface, and which is believed to have marked the exact spot where Arthur received his death wound, is nearly in front of the house at Worthyvale.

He travelled through the south of Europe with Mr. Francis Basset, af terwards Lord de Dunstanville, and held the living of II logan till Mr. John Basset, a younger brother, received priest's orders. He married Miss Mary Praed, of Treve thow; and dying in 1816, he left the larger part of a handsome fortune to Mr. William Warren, a sister's son, who married Miss Marshall, another sister's daughter, and their son having taken the name of Sandys, is now the possessor, and resides at St. Minver. A presentation to the vicarage was given by Mr. Sandys to the Rev. George Treweeke, the son of a third sister, who has also the rectory of Illogan. Mr. Sandys, in consequence of some incident or of some allusion now forgotten, but not in diminution of the respect most justly due to his talents and his learning, acquired the appellation of Cardinal, perhaps from his having worn a scarlet dress at Rome, on some public occasion.

Pentire Point in this parish is the boldest promontory on the southern side of the Bristol Channel. The barton of which this headland forms a part, belonged to a family of the same name, till it passed with an heiress to Roscar rock, and from them by an heiress to Tremayne; and it belongs at present to John Hearle Tremayne, esq. of Heligon. Trevelver, once a seat of the Arundells, belongs' now to the family of Yeo. This parish is divided on the eastern side from St. Kew, by an estuary dangerous to passengers, and where lives were not unfrequently lost, till Mr. Sandys took the lead in constructing a bridge across the ford, which he effected after much exertion, and at a considerable expense to himself. Although St. Minver is strictly one entire parish, yet there are two ancient chapels still remaining with districts assigned to them, out of which some of the parish officers are annually chosen. The parish church, with its more appropriate division, is called Highlands, and the remaining part annexed in some degree to the chapels, is called Lowlands, subdivided into north and south. One of the chapels, according to Mr. Lysons, is dedicated to St. Michael ; which, if the fact is so, must be a very unusual circumstance, as the wings of the archangel appear to have associated his habits, in popular opinion, with those of birds, which led him to delight in elevated situations ; the other chapel has for its patron St. Enodoc or St. Gwinnodock. One of these chapels happening to require repair about the middle of the last century, the vestry or the parish officers sold the bells to reimburse the expense, notwith standing their being tenfold consecrated by the inscription:"], [255, "241 ST. MINVER, OR ST. MYNFER. ALFREDUS REX. It is perhaps too much to assume that they were given by the Great Alfred, although his visits to St. Neot must have brought that most illustrious of our kings into this neighbourhood. The baptising of bells, and their dedication, have so much prevailed, that these were in all probability cast long since the time of Alfred ; but his name should have been their protection, if other protection were wanted than their consecrated use. The following monkish lines not unfrequently appear on bells made prior to the reformation : Laudo Deum verum \u2014 Populum voco \u2014 Congrego clerum Defunctos ploro \u2014 Fugo fulmina : \u2014 Festa decoro.

VOL. III. R"], [256, "242 MORVA. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Morva is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and is bounded to the west by St. Just, to the north by the sea, to the east by Zennor, to the south by Sancred and Maddern. It is a daughter church to Madderne, the vicar of which performs divine service, and preacheth in the morn ing on the first Sunday in every month. The said vicar hath the small tithes. Morva signifies Locus Maritimus, a place near the sea, as this parish is. The name is sometimes written Morveth, implying much the same sense. The chief place, and almost the only one of note in this little parish, is Tregamynyon, that is, the stony dwelling, which was for several generations in the family of Lanyon, and the residence of a younger branch thereof ever since the 30th of Queen Elizabeth ; for in Trinity term the 31st year of her reign was a fine passed at Westminster be tween William Lanyon, gent, and Richard Lanyon, esq. and John Lanyon, gent, of three messuages, ten acres of meadow, sixty acres of pasture, one hundred and fifty acres of furze, one water-mill, ike. in Tregamynyon. Here his posterity flourished in good repute till the reign of Queen Anne, when John Lanyon, of this place, gent, and John Lanyon, jun. his son and heir, joined in the sale of this estate to John Borlase, of Pendeen, esq. who is the present possessor thereof. The said John Lanyon, jun. married to his wife Frances Brydges, sister to James Lord Chandos, and aunt to the Duke of that name, who is since"], [257, "243 MORVA. dead without issue, being well stricken in years when he married, and twice a widower before. John Lanyon, the father, married Borlase, of Pendeen. His grand father was commonly called the Golden Lanyon, as having gotten great riches by tin, which he divided among his numerous issue ; but before I quit this place I must relate for the benefit of my readers what Mr. Lanj'on, sen. told me respecting the covering of his house, as it may be of great use to persons building in high and exposed places. That not being able to keep his house here in good repair, it being rifled and uncovered by every storm, he at last resolved to plaster it with lime and hair on the lathes within, where the stones are fastened ; after which he had not the least stripping of his healing for thirty years. This same thing was tried with the same success by Mr. Hector Trelevant, of St. Agnes ; and it is, I verily believe, a cer tain and cheap prevention of damage. THE MANOR OF CARVOLGHE, OR CORVAEGHE. This manor was one of those forfeited by Francis Tre gian, esq. (See Probus). It appears by an inquisition taken in the fifth year of King Charles the First, that the manor then belonged to Ezekiel Grosse, of Comborne, gent. THE EDITOR. The church of this parish has been recently new built with the assistance of the parliamentary grant. Its situa tion near the sea adds much probability to Mr. Tonkin's interpretation of the name. The great tithes are appended to those of Maddern, and belonged to the family of Nichols, now Le Grice. This parish has to boast of an ancient military work, more curious perhaps than any other in the west of Eng land. It consists of two inclosures nearly circular; the inner 174 feet in diameter, the inner wall 12 feet thick, and r 2"], [258, "244 MORVA. still remaining from 10 to 12 feet high ; outside this is a vacant space 30 feet wide, and then the second wall, having a diameter of almost 230 feet, and built like the other, but less solid and not so high. The stones are all laid after the Cyclopian manner, unhewn and without cement; yet, by great labour and repeated trials, so adjusted as to form a close, even, and apparently smooth front. All round the interior surface of the inner wall are traces of rooms resembling in their situation modern casemates, and near it appear the simple remains of an ancient town. A description and plan of this most interesting ruin called Castle Chiowne, or Chioune, contracted into Choon, which is well known to mean the house in a croft, have been given by Doctor Borlase, in his Antiquities, p. 346 of the 2d edition. There is also a description by Mr. Britton in the second volume of the Beauties of England and Wales ; and a very accurate plan and section, with a full descrip tion, may be found in the Arch\u00e6ologia published in 1829, volume the 22d, p. 300, by William Cotton, esq. M.A. It is to be hoped that the proprietors of the soil will take care to prevent any further destruction of this most ancient and curious fortress, by effectually prohibiting a practice which has disfigured even Rome itself, that of reck lessly removing the materials for domestic purposes. At about 500 yards to the south-west of the Casde, is a cromleigh noticed by Doctor Borlase, p. 232. Morva also contains, either in the whole or in part, the most romantic granite hill of the western formation.

MORVAL. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN. Morval lies in the hundred of West, and has to the west ward the rivers Looe and Duloe, to the north St. Kayne and Leskeard, to the east St. German's, and to the south St. Martin's. In the year 1291, the 20th of Edward the First, (if, at least, I am right in taking this to be the church there called Capella de Lamana,) it was valued at \u00a31. 10s. being then appropriated to the Priory of St. German's. Morval, a vicarage, stands in the King's Book at \u00a36. Us. 9d. The name of this parish signifies the Sea Valley, it being written anciently Morevale ; not that I would from thence insinuate that the sea came up formerly to this place, though the same be not impossible. But as Morval may be interpreted the Mory or Fenny Valley, I rather take that to be the right."], [260, "246 MORVAL. THE EDITOR. It is with much diffidence that I venture to approach the subject of etymologies, but it seems at least to be clear that Mr. Tonkin is mistaken. Val or Vale is not Cornish for a valley, but an inclosure. More, in its original signification is great, large, vast, whence figuratively it has acquired the substantive meaning of a widely extended tract of land ; as the Sea is in English, called the Deep. I conjecture, therefore, that Morval may be The Enclosed Sea, in reference to the Loch, which gives names to the towns of East and West Looe ; or, if the substantive and adjective are inverted, and More resumes its primitive sense, it may be The Large Inclosure. Mr. Bond states, in his History of Looe, and of the neighbourhood, that the principal seat in this parish, and a place of the same name in Cumberland, belonged to Sir Hugh de Morville, \" a foul disgrace to knighthood's fair degree,\" one of those villains who murdered Becket at the altar in Canterbury Cathedral ; but the honour of Cornwall is not stained by the assassin's birth. The manor of Morval passed in early times to the family of Glynn. Mr. Bond has also preserved a very curious memorial of the lawless and unsettled state of Cornwall, and probably of all England, during the contests for plunder, glossed over by the fiction of adverse rights between two branches of the Plantagenets. In the year 1471, John Glynn, esq. was barbarously murdered at Higher Wringworthy, in this parish, by seve ral ruffians, employed by Thomas Clements, whom he had superseded in the office of Under-steward of the Duchy. In the preceding year he had been assaulted and grievously wounded in the face by the retainers of Clements as he was holding the King's Court at Leskeard, and thrown into Leskeard prison, where he signed a compulsory obliga-"], [261, "MORVAL. 247 tion not to prosecute. Some months preceding the mur der, the retainers of Clements went to Morval, and plun dered the house and premises of goods and chattels to the value of two hundred pounds and upwards, as then esti mated. All this appears from the petition of Jane Glynn, the widow, to Parliament, which sets forth, that she could have no redress for these terrible outr.ages in the county of Cornwall, by reason of the general dread of the malice of Clements and his lawless gang; she prayed, therefore, that her appeal might be tried in London by a Cornish jury; and that, in default of Clements appearing to take his trial, he might be dealt with as convicted and attainted. Her petition was granted. The words of Jane Glynn's petition to Parliament are : \" The said Thomas Flete &c. then and there, at four of the clock in the morning, him feloniously and horribly slew and murdered, and clove his head in four parts, and gave him ten deadly wounds in his body ; and when he was dead they cut off one of his legs and one of his arms, and his head from his body, to make him sure; and over that, then and tliere his purse and twenty-two pounds of money numbered, and a signet of gold, a great signet of silver in the same purse contained, a double cloke of muster-de viles, a sword, and a dagger, to the value of six marks, of the goods and chattels of the said John Glynn, feloniously from him they robbed, took, and bore away.\" The following enumeration of the particulars, as con tained in the schedule annexed to Jane Glynn's petition, may perhaps be thought interesting, as giving some idea of the furniture and stock of a gentleman's mansion in the reign of Edward the Fourth. \" Fourteen oxen, ten kien, a bull, eight hors, sixty bo lokis, four hundred shepe, ten swine, six flikkes of bacon, three hundred weight of woll, three brasynpannes, eve rych containing sixty gallon, ten pair of blankets, twelve pair of sheets, four matres, three fether beddes, ten cover letys, twelve pillowes of feders, four long gounes, six short"], [262, "248 MORVAL. gounes, four women gounes, two drought beddes, a hang ing for a chamber, three bankenders, twelve quyssions of tapsterwork, four cuppes of silver, three dozen of peauter vessell, two basons counterfet of latyn, two other basons of latyn, two dozen of sylver spoons, a saltsaler of sylver, two basons of peauter, two saltsalers of peauter, three pipes of Gascoyn wiijL a hoggeshede of swete wyne, two pipes of sider, four ho<ljjeshedes of bere, four hundred galons of ale, three folding taiLles, two feyre long London tabules, four peyre of trestell,1\u00bbjpipefull of salt beef, a hundred of mil well and lyng drye^k quartern of mersau'te lynge, a hun dred weight of talow-^forty pounds of candell, two hun dred hopes, ten baiTe_kft*ve large pypes, eight keves, ten pots of brasse, fourteeiv^Jines of brasse, four pettys of yron, four andyeris, two knbflyng fates, a hundred galons of oyle, six galons of grese, three hundred pounds of hoppes, two hundred bushell of malt, forty bushell of barly, sixty bushell of oyts, four harwyis, ten oxen tices, two plowes, ten yokk, ten London stolys, four pruse coffers, and three London coffers within the same conteyned, four standing cuppes covered, whereof one gilt, dyvers evidences and muniments concernyng the possession of the said John Glynn.\" See also Mr. Lysons. In the very early part of the sixteenth century, Richard Coade, esq. married Thomasine, daughter and heiress of John Glynn, with whom he acquired Morval, and in this family the manor continued till Anne, the daughter and heir of John Coade, carried it by her marriage to John Buller, second son of Francis Buller, of Shillingham. Their grandson, John-Francis Buller, married Rebecca, daughter and coheir of Bishop Trelawny; and on the death of his relation James Buller, of Shillingham, he succeeded to the family estate, very gready increased by a marriage with the heiress of Grosse, a family from Norfolk, which settled first at Leskeard and afterwards resided in the parish of Camborne and Trescobays in Budock. James Buller, son of John-Francis Buller and Rebecca"], [263, "MORVAL. 249 Trelawny, represented the county in Parliament, and died in 1765. Mr. Buller married twice, and left Morval, with a con- siderable portion of his estate, to John, the eldest son of his second marriage with Jane Bathurst, daughter of Allen Bathurst, esq. created one of the twelve Peers by Queen Anne in 1711, and an Earl sixty-one years afterwards by King George the Third, in 1772. Their second son, Francis, became one of the Judges of the King's Bench ; and a third son, Edward, having married a Miss Hoskin, of Looe, lived and died at Port Looe, in the parish of Tallend. Their eldest daughter, Jane, married Sir William Lemon, during fifty years member for the county of Cornwall. The eldest son of his first marriage settled at Downs, near Crediton in Devonshire, a property that he acquired by his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of William Gould, of that place, which is now the residence of his grandson James- Wentworth Buller. Mr. John Buller resided at Morval, represented Exeter, Launceston, and West Looe in Parliament ; and married Ann Lemon, only sister of Sir William Lemon.

The seat next of importance in this parish is Bray And Mr. Bond says of it, \" Bray, Bre, Brea, in Cornish signify a hill ; and this place is situated on the side of Bin down Hill. Bray commands very beautiful prospects.\" The manor of Bray, then held under the Vyvyans, as of their manor of Treviderow, was in the reign of Charles the Second in the family of Heles, who were succeeded by the Mayows, of which family was Dr. John Mayow, an eminent physician in the reign of Charles the Second, who contributed some papers on Respiration, and other sub jects, to the Philosophical Transactions. Bray is now the property and occasional residence of Philip- Wynill Mayow, esq. Another account which I have met with states, that Phi lip Mayow, of Looe, purchased in the sixth of Elizabeth (anno 1504) the manor of Bree or Bray, in the parish of Morval, of Christopher Copplestone, of Warleigh, esq. These accounts, therefore, vary ; and which is right I can not ascertain.

In the forty-first number of the publications made by the Royal Society previous to the regular series of the Philo sophical Transactions, anno 1668, p. 833, will be found an account of two works by John Mayow, LL.D. and M.D. Tractatus duo. Prior de Respiratione, Alter de Rachitide (the rickets) ; see also the Abridgment, vol. i. p. 295, where the authors say in a note, \" As an account of the life and opinions of Dr. Mayow was published only a few years ago by a physician now living, we deem it unnecessary to insert in this place a biographical notice of this distin guished chemist and physiologist. We shall only remark, that in his writings are to be found the primordia of some of the most important theories and experiments of modern chemical philosophers.'\" The physician alluded to was Thomas Beddoes, of Pem broke College, Oxford, and afterwards of Clifton, near Bristol, whose life has been given to the public by Dr. John Edmonds Stock, in one vol. 4to, printed for Murray in 1811; and his pamphlet is entitled, \" Chemical Expe riments and Opinions extracted from a Work published in the Last Century. Printed at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1790.\" Doctor Beddoes here bestows on Mayow the praise he most justly merits, and to be praised by Doctor Beddoes is laudari a laudato viro. Few persons ever displayed more genius or power of invention ; and to him we mainly owe the preparation of Humphry Davy for his splendid philo sophical career, after a most fortunate introduction by the Editor of this Work. Anthony Wood gives the following particulars of Mayow : \" John Mayow descended from a genteel family of his name, living at Bree in Cornwall; was bom in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West in Fleet-street, London, ad mitted scholar of Wadham College the 27th of September"], [266, "252 MORVAL. 1661, aged sixteen years; chosen Probationary Fellow of All Souls College soon after, and upon the recommenda tions of Henry Coventry, esq. one of the Secretaries of State ; where, though he had a legist's place, and took the degrees in the civil law, yet he studied physic, and be came noted for his practice therein, especially in the sum mer time in the city of Bath ; but better known by these books, which show the pregnancy of his parts.

A manor, or reputed manor, called Wringworthy, be longs to the Copleys of Bake. The only place of trade in this parish is a small village, situated at the spot where the Looe River ceases to be navigable for barges at high water. There are several kilns for burning lime, which is used to a great extent throughout all the neighbourhood as a manure; but the modern name of Sand Place indicates a recent origin.

At the general dissolution, the tithes of this parish were valued at \u00a35. 6s. 9^-6?. being a part of the ecclesiastical pos sessions of the hospital of St. John at Bridgewater. The great tithes now belong to the family of Trefusis, through those of Walpole and Rolle. This parish forms the north-eastern extremity of the county, and gives origin to the river Tamar, (Ta-more, the great water,) which flows to the south coast, there forming the superb harbour of Plymouth. The portion of More winstow adjoining to the Irish channel, partakes of the rugged grandeur common to this district. The church stands near the cliff, commanding a fine view of the sea. The building is large, containing several fine specimens of"], [269, "255 MOREWINSTOW. gothic architecture. It is also decorated by monuments, to the Kempthornes, Waddons, Sic. Mr. Lysons states, that the principal villages in this parish are Coumbe, Crosstown, Eastcot, Gooseham, Hallabeer, Woolford, and Woolley. He also states, that Stanbury, a seat and manor in this parish, belonged to a family of the same name, and gave birth to Richard Stanbury, Bishop of Hereford, who died in 1471. But Mr. Lysons seems to have fallen into an error respecting the christian name of this individual, and also as to the year of his decease. John Stanbury was confessor to King Henry the 6th, and made by him the first Provost of the College, which that unfortunate king founded at Eton in the 19th year of his reign, 1440-41. He was made Bishop of Bangor, May 4th, 1448, and translated from thence to Hereford, on the 7th of February, 1453, and died May the 11th, 1474. Little more seems to be known of this prelate, although he must have been a man of learning and of much considera tion in his time, and one who may fairly be reckoned among the distinguished persons of the county. The property of the Stanburys passed to the family of Mannings, and has been subdivided among heiresses. The great tithes of this manor, and of some other lands in the parish, have been endowed on the vicarage. Tonacombe belonged to a family said to have changed their name from Lea to Kempthorne, although the reason of their doing so is not known. The family resided there during several descents, till it passed by an heiress about a hundred and fifty years ago to the Waddons. It has again passed by a female descent, and is now the property of William Waddon Martyn, esq. There is also a farm in this parish called Lea, belonging to George Thynne Carteret, son of Henry Frederick Thynne, second son of Thomas Thynne, and Louisa Car teret, daughter of Grace Granville, daughter and coheir of John Granville, created Earl of Bath by King Charles the 2d."], [270, "256 MOREWINSTOW.

There is a marble monument to the Rev. T.

He died in 1682. At the foot of the inscription, which is in Latin, was the following : Earth take mine earth, my sin let Satan have it, The World my goods, my soul my God, who gave it ; For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, <and God, My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul I had. The tower was built by Mr. Robert Luddra, probably an inhabitant of the parish, in 1500. The great tithes do not form a part of the general funds belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, but they are specially appropriated to support the vicars choral of the Cathedral Church. The manor of Pradannack is said by Mr. Lysons to have belonged to the family of Serjeaux, and to have passed from them by a coheiress to the De Veres, Earls of Oxford. It is now divided into Higher and Lower Wor tha and Wollas, one belonging to Mrs. Agar, heir of the Robartes family, the other to the Vyvyans of Trelowarren, and the manor of Clahar to the famdy of Boscawen.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. By far the greater part of this parish rests on serpentine, the nature of which is beautifully displayed in Kinance Cove, where many rocks are highly polished by the action of the waves, exhibiting a mottled and variegated surface not unlike the skin of a serpent, from which resemblance the rock derives its name. Between Pradanack and the sea, and between the church and the sea, bounded on the south by the rivulet which flows to Mullion Cove, there are two patches of hornblende rocks, both massive and schistose. These rocks are not of the same nature as the greenstone which occur near the granite, but resemble those of Porthoustock, Cadgwith, Landowednack, and other places near the serpentine : it is therefore very probable that the analysers may detect mag nesia in both the hornblende and the felspar, of which these rocks are composed. North of a line drawn from the church to about the middle of Bolerium Cove, the rocks appear to belong to the calcareous series. The Editor cannot pass by the mentioning of Kinance Cove without remarking on the extreme beauty and elegance of its appearance. Whenever the granite reaches the shore, and it does so only with some interruptions for a few miles round the Land's End, the cliffs are composed of angular blocks piled on each other, seeming with masculine strength to defy the utmost strength of the ocean. At Kinance, on the con trary, the whole scenery appears feminine. The rocks are rounded, smooth, polished, and variegated with beautiful colours; and although they are of large dimensions, yet every face and every turn is elegant ; the very sand that s 2"], [274, "260 ST. NEOT. lies between them is of the most fine and shining texture. No one desirous of viewing the beauties of Cornwall should neglect to visit this Cove. The serpentine formation, one of the most rare, is highly interesting to geologists, with its accompanying diallage, and veins of asbestos and of stea tite, frequently shot through by native copper in the form of dendrites. Here too the botanist will find various plants besides the Erica Vagans, peculiar, in Cornwall at least, to this formation, among which one of the most rare is the Asparagus Officinalis ; and, lastly, the serpentine of Kinance is now turned in lathes, and made into some of the most pleasing ornaments for chimney pieces or cabinets.

The principal manor and advowson of the church, which had been both divided, are most fortunately again united in the Rev. Richard Gerveys Grylls, since we are indebted to the taste and to the liberality of this gentleman, for more"], [276, "262 ST. NEOT. than restoring the beautiful decorations of the church to their original splendour. The church is situated in a pleasing and retired vale, watered by a branch of the Fowey river, and abounding with trees ; while the country surrounding it, on almost every side, is even now little cultivated, and must in former times have been a desert. No situation could be more adapted for the retreat of an anchorite ; and monkish le gends inform us that St. Guevor, or Guervier, or Guerer, fixed his abode at this place ; and in after times, the sound of his name being found to somewhat resemble the French verb Guerir, to heal, tales were invented of his performing miraculous cures ; and in particular of his having enabled King Alfred to sit on a horse at the precise moment when his presence in the field became indispensably necessary to oppose the pagan Danes. If St. Guerir ever resided here at all, he must have very opportunely made way for St. Neot, since it is well ascer tained that he also occupied this retreat in the reign of his brother or relation the Great Alfred. St. Neot, having withdrawn from the Abbey of Glaston bury, founded by St. Joseph of Arimathea, retired into this solitude ; where he adopted the singular penance of plunging himself daily into a well of cold water, and there remaining immersed to his neck till he had repeated the whole Book of Psalms. The miraculous powers how ever bestowed on him by the Almighty, in recompense for conduct so conducive to the happiness and well-being of his creatures, forbad St. Neot to remain secreted. Multi tudes flocked to him from all parts ; he founded a monas tery, and repaired lo Rome for a confirmation and for blessing at the hands of the Pope : these were readily ob tained. He returned to his monastery, where frequent visits were made to him by King Alfred, on which occa sions he admonished, instructed, and informed the great founder of English liberty ; and finally quitted this mortal life on the 31st of July, about the year 883, in the odour"], [277, "ST. NEOT. 263 of sanctity so unequivocal, that travellers all over Corn wall were solaced by its fragrance. Nor did the exertions of our Saint terminate with his existence on earth ; he frequently appeared to King Alfred, and sometimes led his armies in the field. But if the tales of these times are deserving of any confidence, the nation is really and truly indebted to St. Neot for one of the greatest blessings ever bestowed on it. To his advice, and even to his personal assistance as a teacher, we owe the foundation by Alfred of the University at Oxford. The relics of St. Neot remained at his monastery in Cornwall till about the year 974, when Earl Alric, and his wife Ethelfleda, having founded a religious house at Eynesbury, in Huntingdonshire, and being at a loss for some patron saint, adopted the expedient of stealing the body of St. Neot; which was accordingly done, and the town retains his name, thus feloniously obtained, up to the present time. The monastery in Cornwall continued feebly to exist after this disaster through the Saxon times ; but having lost its palladium, it felt the roiner's hand ; and almost immediately after the Norman Conquest, it was finally suppressed; yet the memory of the local saint is still cherished by the inhabitants of the parish and of the neighbourhood, endeared perhaps by the tradition of his diminutive stature, reduced in their imaginations to fifteen inches of height; and to these feelings we in all probability owe the preservation of the painted glass, the great decora tion of this church, and one of the principal works of art to be seen in Cornwall. The church itself is of the best, description, having a nave and two aisles of equal length, with a square tower at the western end, and with the rare addition of an embat tled parapet towards the south, but probably not older than the fifteenth century, with the exception of some parts of the walls near the chancel, which seem to have been a part of the former church. Soon after the new building had been completed, individuals in some cases, and associa-"], [278, "264 ST. NEOT. tions in others, as the unmarried men of the parish, the unmarried women, and the wives, contributed a window, either in honour of the local saint, or of their particular patrons ; and the peculiar attachment felt for the little saint seems to have preserved these fragile materials at the two important periods of our modern history, the time when the great change of religion took place, and at that of the Civil Wars. It may however be recollected that no violent change occurred here, the monastic institution hav ing been dissolved by the Earl of Morton, half brother of the Conqueror; and no place could be more retired from the observation of strangers, or from the passage of fanatical armies. From the time of the Reformation, however, all care about maintaining these decorations ceased, and the whole in a few years more would have fallen into utter decay, if Mr. Grylls had not nobly stepped forwards, not to support or repair, but to renew these gems ; which he has most ef fectually done, at an expense not short of two or three thousand pounds. The church has now sixteen windows entirely filled with painted glass of the most beautiful co lours and designs ; about half of the whole consisting of the old glass most carefully preserved, and the new added in a style completely harmonizing with the former : all exe cuted in London by Mr. J.

On an elevated part of the uncultivated lands which"], [279, "265 ST.

Most marvellous stories used to be current respecting this little lake ; no lead could sound the depth of the water, which rose and fell with the tide, &c. :\u2014 but the depth no where exceeds two or three fathoms, and any consent with the tide is obviously impossible. A tale of a very different nature, connected with this lake, was as universally re peated, and more than half believed, sixty years ago. Tregagle is the name of a family not long extinct. Mr. Lysons says Tregagle, of Trevorder, in St. Breock ; arms, Argent, three bucks passant Or. One of this family hav ing, for some reason, become unpopular, the traditions re specting a mythological personage have been applied to him. The object of these tales of unknown antiquity was, like Orestes, continually pursued by an avenging being, from whom he could find refuge only from time to time, by flying to the cell or chapel on Roach Rock; till at last his fate was changed into the performance of a task, to ex haust the water from Dozmere, with an implement less adapted, if possible, for its appropriate work, than were the colanders given to the daughters of Danaus : Hocc', ut opinor, id est, \u00e6vo florente puellas, Quod memorant, laticem pertusum congerere in vas, Quod tamen expleri nulla ratione potestur. Tregagle is provided simply with a limpet shell, having a hole bored through it ; and with this he is said to labour without intermission ; in dry seasons, flattering himself that he has made some progress towards the end of his work ; but when rain commences, and the \" omnis effusus labor\" becomes apparent, he is believed to roar so loudly, in utter despair, as to be heard from Dartmoor Forest to the Land's End."], [280, "266 ST. NEOT. The name of this small lake, about a mile in circum ference, has excited much curiosity, remaining still unsatis fied. I approach etymology with diffidence, proposing nothing but as a conjecture. On the second syllable of Doz-mere indeed there has not been a doubt, it is understood on all hands to mean a lake ; now Doz is said in our glossaries to agree with the English verb to come, but that joined with water it means the tide ; may not Doz mere then represent the currently received opinion of these waters ebbing and flowing, and mean literally the tide lake ? The English termination, utterly destructive of its dignity or importance, is at all events unnecessary to the sense. St. Neot measures 12,739 statute acres.

[The small dwelling of a farmer, and a few stumps of trees, alone mark the spot. Ed.] To the south of Treludra, just in from the downs, stands the borough of Mitchell, the best part of which being in this parish, as the rest is in St. Eroder, Mr. Browne Willis thus describes it: \" Mitchell is a small hamlet, scarce con taining thirty houses, all cottages save one, which is a public inn, not long since erected, which is the only healed (slated) house in this poor borough. Concerning the an tiquity of this borough, and when it was created so, I have little to say ; but that it first sent members to parliament in the sixth year of Edward the Sixth, in which return it is called villa Mychell, as it is in all the ancient indentures, styled burgus or villa Mychell, Mitchell, or Modishole. Mr. Carew calls it Meddleschale, the name Mitchell never occurring till in modern times. The manor of this place is still in possession of the ancient family of Arundell, of Lanherne, whose ancestor, Ralph de Arundell, purchased the same in the time of Henry the Third, by whose interest, I presume, with Richard Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, this little town obtained the privileges of a market and fairs. In anno the thirtieth"], [283, "269 NEWLIN. OR ST. NEWLIN. Edward the First, John de Arundell (grandson of the afore said Ralph, who had been Sheriff of Cornwall in the forty fourth of Henry the Third,) certified his claim to a mar ket and fair in his manor of Modishole, which he chal lenged by hereditary descent from Ralph de Arundell, his ancestor, and pleaded that the said Ralph purchased this manor of Piers de Ralegh, heir of Walter de Ralegh. The manor of Degembris was one of those forfeited by Francis Tregian, esq. (see Probus). It was either given or sold to John Arundell, of Trerise, esq. by King Charles the First. In this manor Pallamaunter, or Palmaunter, was for merly a gentleman's seat, and gave name to an ancient family since removed to Trevyrick, in St. Columb Minor. The manor of Tresulion. Here it is said was born Sir Robert Tresulion, or Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of Eng land under Richard the Second, though some say he was born at another place. It certainly however belonged to a family of that name, till it went, or rather the barton, with a female heir, to a branch of the Carnes of Glamorgan shire. The manor went probably, by purchase, to the Arundells. But in the year 1599, Thomas Davies, of Ca non Teign, in Devon, esq. seized the barton under a mort gage, and his descendant, Mary, widow of Sir George Cary, of Clovelly, in Devonshire, sold it to Gully, gent, who settled himself there, from whom, having lost all his children, it devolved on his nephew Samuel Gully, esq. The manor of Treworthen was the seat of a very consi derable family, of which Walter de Treworthen, or Tre worden, was Sheriff of Cornwall 7th of Henry the Third, as was Sir Otho de Treworthen 4th Henry the Fifth, and Sir John de Treworthen was knight of the shire 21st Richard the Second. The arms of Treworthen were Ar gent, three boar's heads couped Sable, armed Gules. This manor, now reduced nearly to the barton, is the property of Wills, of Wivelscomb, a minor."], [284, "270 NEWLIN, OR ST. NEWLIN. MANOR OF TRERICE. Mr. Carew says, in Edward the Third's reign Ralph Arundell matched with the heir of this land and name, since which time his issue hath there continued, (not so, for their chief seat was at Efford, Carew, p. 119, till the reio-n of Edward the Fourth,) and increased their livelihood by sundry like inheritors, as St. John, Jew, Durant, and Thurlebear. John Arundell, mentioned by Mr. Carew, p. 146, and his father-in-law, lived to a very great age, being the same who was called \" the Tilbury,\" and \" John for the King.\" The arms of Arundell of Trerice were, Sable, three chevrons Argent, but of later times the same as Arundell of Lanherne.

From this connection, and from various settlements and arrangements growing O O C*> out of it, Trerice, with a considerable estate annexed, has devolved on Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, late member for Devonshire. There is also a monument to the Rev. Henry Pooley, the late vicar, who departed this life in Sept. 1821, es teemed as a clergyman, as a gentleman, and in his do mestic relations. On his decease Doctor William Carey, then Bishop of Exeter, bestowed the living on the Rev. Richard Polwhele, in consideration of his eminence in .almost every department of literature. MANOR OF CARGOLS. The leasehold property of this manor, purchased by Mr. Philip Hawkins, remained in his family till his great grandson, the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, acquired the freehold in the year 1804 or 5, under the authority of parliament, for redeeming the Land Tax from the See of Exeter. The other portion of the Borlase property, sold to Sir William Scawen, has not remained so permanently in the possession of any family. Treludra, and its appendages, had certain incorporeal rights, which made them objects of peculiar attention. Mr. Scawen, who inherited this pro perty from the original purchaser, sold it to Mr. Basset, afterwards Lord de Dunstanville ; and about the year 1798 it was finally sold to Sir Christopher Hawkins, who thus united again the Borlase property in this neighbourhood. It is now needless to investigate the constitution of the little borough of Michell, further than to state that the right of voting for Members of Parliament had been deter mined to reside in five individuals, holding certain nominal tenures within the borough, and denominated mesne lords, and in such persons living within the borough, as paid"], [286, "272 NEWLIN, OR ST. NEWLIN. scot and lot. These last were in latter times reduced to four, so as to constitute the five mesne lords a majority. Nothing could prima facie appear more absurd, or bear more the appearance of a childish mockery of representa tion. But in point of fact, this and other close boroughs had nothing to do with representation at all, in the sense usually applied to that word : they were fortuitous con trivances giving weight to property, and restraining an assembly partly delegated, and thereby possessing a strong spirit of freedom, within such bounds as allowed distinct branches of government to co-exist with this otherwise all powerful body. They are now swept away, and new insti tutions seem fast arising ; but whether these shall prove ad vantageous to the happiness and to the welfare of man kind, or the contrary, our posterity will be more able to decide. They m.ay perhaps discover that the apparent obstacles in our Constitution, really contained the secret springs which gave a regulated motion to the British Go vernment, when it was esteemed the wonder and the admi ration of the world. A large extent of waste ground, belonging to the Tre ludra purchase, having been enclosed, and efforts made to bring it into cultivation by various methods, and among these by folding sheep, it received the name of Shepherds. The late Sir Christopher Hawkins continued with eager ness what he found commenced ; and trying the expedient of ploughing deep, to remove the stratum of shattered sili ceous spar, which occurs immediately under the peaty turf of all such lands throughout Cornwall, lead ore was brought to the surface ; when this spirited individual, who is said to have expended five thousand pounds a year in wages for a considerable length of time, began a mine at his own ex pense, and encouraged by its first efforts he brought in an adit, erected more than one steam engine, and wrought the mine to a veryconsiderabledepth. The quantity of lead raised from the mine proved sufficient to pay all the expenses, and in addition, the lead was found to be rich in silver, much above the general average of such as are usually tested."], [287, "273 NEWLIN, OR ST. NEWLIN. All the operations were conducted on the place. The ores were smelted, silver to the amount of some tens of thousands, of pounds value was extracted from the lead, and the litharge again revived. In all these matters Sir Christopher Hawkins was mainly assisted by one whose name I am happy to record. His saltern accumulem donis, et fungar inani Munere. Mr. John Giddy was born in January 1760, and having received the common school education, he found himself compelled to waste the greater part of his life in an in- ferior situation at a tin smelting house. He had however the advantage of much leisure, which he employed in the cultivation of his mind and in the acquirement of know- ledge; and without any apprehension of my judgment be- ing warped in favour of one, whom I have esteemed more as a brother than a relation, throughout a period exceeding fifty years, I will venture to say that in matters connected with chemistry and practical science, few excelled him ; that in honour and integrity he was excelled by none ; and that in more recondite studies, even in the acquirement of foreign literature, his progress much more resembled what mio-ht be expected from persons having every artificial advantage in life, than from him who had been in a great measure deprived of them all. He never married, and died suddenly in last January (1835), at Shepherds, having just completed his seventy-fifth year. I am myself approaching the age of man, and but that children, and grandchildren, carry our views forward and enliven old age, I should acquiesce in the sentiment of Juvenal : H\u00e6c data pcena din viventibus, ut renovata Semper clade dom us; multis in luctibus, inque Perpetuo m\u0153rore, et nigra veste senescanl. And, darker as it downward bears, Is stained with past and present tears. vol. in. T"], [288, "274 NEWLIN, OR ST. NEWLIN. Mr. Lysons says that a manor, called the manor of Newlyn, belonged to the other branch of the Arundells \u2014 that of Lanherne. It may, however, be remarked that a manor bearing the name of a parish is frequently limited to a very small part of that with which it would seem to be co-extensive : in such cases the manor probably derives its name from the church having been built on it. Sir John Arundell, who was Sheriff of Cornwall in the 10th year of Edward the Fourth, lost his life in an attack on St. Michael's Mount, then recently seized by Richard de Vere, Earl of Oxford. This gentleman had removed his residence from Effcrd, on the coast near Stratton, and amidst the sands, to Trerice ; and these circumstances gave origin to one of the thousand idle tales invented on such occasions, and which the diffused intelligence of the present time has scarcely yet eradicated, \u2014 that some foreteller of future events had warned him of dying in the sand, that he went from Efford to counteract the will of fate, which became accomplished however at the foot of St. Michael's Mount. The Sir John Arundell, mentioned by Mr. Tonkin as known by the name of \" John for the King,\" and as living to a great age, defended Pendennis Castle with the utmost bravery, after he had passed his eightieth year ; and his son, Sir Richard Arundell, distinguished himself at several battles in the Civil War. This gentleman, soon after the Restoration of King Charles the Second, was created Lord Arundell, of Trerice ; his grandson, the last heir male, died in 1773. The house retains the appearance of a splendid man sion in times passed by. The south-western wing has been repaired and beautified internally by Sir Thomas Acland.

This parish is composed of the same kind of rocks as the neighbouring parishes of Cubert, Colan, and St. Columb Minor. It is entirely placed within the calcareous series. At Trevemper bridge is a bed of compact limestone, similar to that which is so common in many parts of Cornwall, and is provincially known by the name of black lime. This rock has been noticed under the head of St. Germans, and it is very abundant at Rock Ferry, in St. Minver, opposite Padstow. It may be proper to add that Newlyn, west of Penzance, grown to be in reality a town of some importance, is legally no more than a village in the parish of Paul, without any separation whatever.

The manuscript relating to Padstow is lost. TONKIN. Padstow, in the hundred of Pider, is bounded to the west by St. Merrin, to the north and east by the sea, its own har bour, and the river Alan, to the south by Little Petherick. Leland (Itinerary, vol. ii. sol. 75), speaking of the town here saith, \"this town is ancient, bearing the name of Lode nek in Cornish, and in English after the true and old writings Adelstowe, Latin, Athelstani locus, and the town there taketh King Adelstanefor the chief giver of privileges unto it.\" In Tax. Benef. 20 Edw. I. it is also called Eccles' de Aldestowe, and valued \u2014 the rectory in 106s. 8d. and the vicar in 13s. id. being appropriated to the priory of Bodmin. Notwithstanding which I take it that it has its name from the famous St. Petrock, an abbreviation of Pe trockstow, St. Petroc's Place, to whom this church is by all allowed to be dedicated, and who most probably was born here ; as more certain it is that he was buried in St. Petroc's church in Bodmin, as you may see there. But Fuller (Worthies in Wales, p. 13), from Bale calls Petrok, a Welsh-Irish-Cornish man, as having his birth in Wales, his breeding in Ireland (according to the custom of that age), from whence after twenty years' studying he came into Cornwall, and fixed himself at Petrok's-stowe, now corruptly Padstowe, from a small oratory so called from him ; that he wrote a book of Solitary Life, whereto he was much addicted, and flourished anno 560 ; but Col lier from Hiirpsfield, whose authority I prefer, makes him to go from Cornwall into Ireland, so that as I said before we may claim the honour of his birth.

The most probable opinion respecting the name of Pad stow seems to be, that St. Petroc originally fixed his her mitage or his monastic establishment at this place, from whence he afterwards removed to Bodmin. At the taxation of Pope Nicholas this parish stands, Ecclesia de Aldestowe \u00a35. 6s. 8d.; Vicarius ejusdem 13s. id. In the Valor Ecclesiasticus, 26th of Henry the Eighth, preserved in the First Fruits Office, among the property belonging to the monastery at Bodmin, the following entries occur with respect to Padstow : \u00a3. s. d.

Mr. Whitaker conjectures that the original monastic establishment of this Saint occupied the spot, since inha bited by one of greater learning, and we may fairly pre sume imbued with a more deep infusion of real piety, the well-known and respected author of the Connection of The Old and New Testament, and of a variety of other works, all evincing his profound erudition, strong abilities, and goodness of heart."], [293, "279 PADSTOW. The Prideauxes are understood to have held this pro perty before the Reformation under a lease for lives from the priors of Bodmin, who appear to have been high lords, at least, of the whole town. Mr. Carew, after noticing Padstow, and referring to a charter of incorporation which unquestionably never had any existence, says, \" Mr. Nicholas Prideaux, from his new and stately house thereby, taketh a full and large prospect of the town, haven, and country adjoining, to all which his wisdom is a stay, his authority a direction. He mar ried one of Viel's coheirs ; and, though endowed with fair re venues in Devon, maketh Cornwall beholden to his resi dence. He beareth, Argent, a chevron Sable, in chief a file with three lambeaux Gules.\" P. 144; 340, Lord de Dunstanville's edit. This family appears to have been greatly benefited by the confiscations of those times, since the Devonshire branch acquired all the ecclesiastical possessions of Bod min Priory, and what had been held under lease from the monastery about Padstow, became converted into freehold ; and soon after the possession could be considered as as sured, Mr. Nicholas Prideaux built this house, which con tinues to be one of the most handsome and imposing of all the gentlemen's houses in Cornwall. The exterior retains its original appearance, the interior has received various and recent improvements ; a splendid staircase is under stood to have been brought from Stowe in Kilkhampton. The late Mr. Charles Prideaux went into holy orders during the life of his elder brother; and afterwards assumed the name of Brune in addition to Prideaux on his succeed ing to the estate of that family. He married Miss Patten, sister of Mr. Peter Patten Bowles ; they have left one son, who is married to Miss Glynn, and three daughters, the eldest married to Mr. Sawle, of Penrice. The church is handsome and spacious, and is said to have been built by Thomas Vivian, Prior of St. Petroc's, Bodmin, and titular Bishop of Megara in Greece. It con-"], [294, "280 PADSTOW. tains several monuments to the Prideaux family, and to others. The town is not large, and the harbour is so surrounded by rocks and obstructed by sand, that vessels even of a small size are unable to find shelter there when the wind blows on the shore, and security is much wanted. Plans have been suggested for constructing a mole from the eastern side of the harbour, near its entrance, so as to greatly narrow the opening, and by so doing give power to the very extensive back-water to deepen the channel, and this work, with the removal of some rocks, would, it is believed, make Padstow a safe place of refuge for all ships navigating St. George's Channel or the Severn sea; but the expense must far exceed all that could be contributed to a private undertaking, and therefore no hope can be en tertained of such an improvement being made, unless the forming of a safe harbour in such a situation should be deemed worthy of becoming a national work. A considerable trade was brought to this part about the middle of the last century by Mr. William Rawlings, who, emerging from a shop at St. Columb, raised himself, and conferred benefits on all around him by an union of talent, industry, and integrity. He was succeeded by his son Mr. Thomas Rawlings, who served the office of Sheriff in the year 1803, and built a large house just out of the town, named Saunder's Hill; but various concerns having proved less successful in the latter part of his life, and leaving a large family, the property has been sold, and the house taken down. It is a curious and singular occurrence respecting the tithes of this parish, that they have been split ; probably in consequence of leases granted by the priory of St. Petroc. The Prideaux family have continued to possess the tithe of fish, and some other advantages, while the general tithes of the parish belong to a gentleman of the name of Hall. There are said to have been several chapels in the parish ; one dedicated to St. Sampson, not to the Jewish"], [295, "PADSTOW. 281 Hercules, but to a native of Glamorganshire, born in the fifth century, who after spending years in solitude, converting whole nations, performing miracles, and in Britany raising a man from the dead, founded the splendid abbey of Dole in Franche Comte, where he died on the 6th of July in 564. This chapel is believed to have been built on the ruins of St. Petroc's monastery, destroyed by the Danes in 981, and therefore on the spot now occupied by Mr. Pri deaux's house, which would be called Padstow Place, but for the alliteration. Another chapel stood in a direction from the town, now distinguished by one of the most beautiful walks any where to be seen, when the high water overflows the sand of this extensive estuary. This chapel, called St. Saviour's, in common with various others in similar situations, was dedicated by navigators to our Lord, in a capacity very limited with respect to that of the Redeemer of the whole world from the destruction caused by original sin ; they made it only as a votive offering in return for iheir own temporal pre servation from shipwreck. An account is given in a black-letter pamphlet, written by G. Classe, of Torrington in Devonshire, of a most melancholy domestic tragedy which took place in this town early in the reign of King James the First, arising entirely from the violent spirit of fanaticism then raging in men's minds with ten-fold fury in consequence of recent persecu tion and existing intolerance.

The rocks of this parish are somewhat similar to those of St. Mervyn, which is already stated to belong to the cal careous series. The rocks are well exposed on the shores of Padstow harbour, and therefore they merit a more par ticular description. The southern part of this parish consists chiefly of a blue slate, which in some strata is very fissile, and in other strata it separates into thick lamellar pieces, and passes in the adjoining strata into calcareous schist. This slate at Dinah's Cave contains a bed of black limestone, which may be a continuation of that on the opposite side of the harbour at Rock ferry. At the latter place, the transitions between the blue slate and the limestone are beautifully dis played. The limestone is of the same nature as that in Veryan on the south coast. Proceeding towards Slepper Point, at the entrance of the harbour, after passing the town of Padstow, the cliffs consist of alternate beds of compact and of schistose greenstone ; these continue to line the shore with broken rocks for more than a mile, and they are succeeded by red and greenish slates, which are lamellar, of a fine tex ture, and rather hard, resembling the mineral called nova culite or hornestone ; and connected with this slate occurs"], [297, "283 PADSTOW. a compact crystalline rock like that of Trevose Head in St. Mervyn, consisting of small crystals of glossy felspar, and of a scaly pulverulent mineral of a greenish colour, the nature of which is not very apparent. This singular rock may be the equivalent of diallage rock, a member of the serpentine series, as its position bears a great resemblance to that of the Lizard magnesian rocks. At Penniscen Bay, on the north side of the parish, the cliff exhibits many alternations of limestone and slate ; this limestone is more crystalline than the black limestone of Rock Ferry, approaching nearer to the Plymouth lime stone in its appearance ; but organic remains have not yet been discovered in it. The slate between the beds of limestone is a calcareous schist, and is of a white colour, and earthy where it has been weathered ; but when perfect it is found, especially near the limestone, to be of a blue colour with broad diagonal bands or stripes of brown, precisely like the cal careous slate which occurs in Werrington, near Yealm Bridge, where it is extensively quarried for chimney-pieces, and for other domestic or ornamental purposes.

In 625 he accompanied the Princess Ethelburgha, daughter to Ethelbert King of Kent, when she married Edwyn King of the Northumbrians, where he laboured so effectually that he converted that king and the greatest part of his people,* so that he was consecrated the first Archbishop of York, and Pope Honorius sent him the pall about the year 630 ; but, Edwyn being killed in battle in 633 by C.adwallo King of the Britons, and Penda King of Mercia, he was forced to fly back into Kent with Queen Ethelburga and her children, where her brother Eadbald, King thereof, receiving them with all kindness, made Paulinus Bishop of Rochester, where he ended his days on the 10th of October 644.

The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to October the 10th; and although this saint is generally com memorated on the 12th of March, the day of his decease, yet in his own city of Leon the very 10th of October is consecrated to his memory : which, together with his being a Cornish man, seems to fix St. Paul de Leon as the Patron Saint, in opposition to St. Paulinus the first Archbishop of York, who was sent by Pope Gregory the Great into Eng land shortly after the mission of St. Austin ; his festival is held on October the 12th. This church and that of Breage were attached to the mitred abbey of Hailes in Gloucestershire, as founded by one of the greatest promoters of monastic establishments on record, Richard King of the Romans and Earl of Cornwall. He began the building in 1246 ; and in 125 1, when he had expended ten thousand marks in finishing the monastery, he had the church dedicated to St. Mary on the 9th of November, in the presenee of the King and Queen, thirteen Bishops, most of the Barons, and above three hundred Knights, all of whom he entertained with incredible state and plenty, letting fall this generous and devout expression : \" I wish it had pleased God that all my great expenses in my Castle of Wallingford had been as wisely and soberly employed.\" Edmund Earl of Cornwall, son and heir of Richard the founder, having, in his travels through Germany with his"], [300, "286 PAUL father, obtained a relic considered to be blood of our Saviour, gave a third part to this monastery in 1272, thereby causing a great increase in the number of people resorting to it.

A great part of the lands surrendered by the Abbey of Hailes are in possession of the Tracy family ; but the im propriated tithes of Paul belonged, in the early part of the last century, to the family of Gwavas, since which time they have passed with two coheiresses to Veale and Car lyon. The church is placed a little beyond the brow of a lofty ridge ascending from the sea, so that it is not much seen, but the tower rising above the ridge is visible from a great distance. The church is large, and contains several monu ments to members of different families, \u2014 Godolphin, Pen darves, Hitchins, &c. In this parish are situated Mousehole and Newlyn, two towns of pretty considerable size, although, being very near to Penzance, they have not any regular market. Mousehole, formerly called Porth Enys, the Island Port, on account of a small island close in upon the shore, had in remote times not the privilege merely, but the actual pos session of a market and fairs, but having been destroyed by"], [301, "PAUL 287 a predatory invasion of some Spaniards in July 1595, and Penzance rising fast into importance, the practice of hold ing them has been discontinued ever since. Mr. Carew, p. 156 (p. 381 of Lord de Dunstan ville's edition), gives a detailed account of this invasion, which is said to have occasioned the capture of Cadiz by a combined English and Dutch squadron in the ensuing year. In Paul church is the following inscription, recording the savage conduct of these invaders : \" The Spanyer burnt this church in the year 1595.\" And the parish register commences with this notice : \" Register of St. Pawle in the countie of Cornwall, from the 23 daye of Julie, the year of our gracious Lord God 1595, on which daie, soon after the sun was risen, the church, tower, bells, and all other things pertaining to the same, together with the houses and goods, was burned and spoiled by the Spaniards in the said parish, being Wens daie the daye aforesaid, in the 37th year of the raigne of our Soveraine Ladie Elezabeth, by the grace of God of England, France, and Ireland Queene, Defender of the Faith, &c. \" Per me, Joh'nem Tremearne, Vicarium.\" Entries, 1595 : \" Jenken Keigwyn, of Mousehole, being killed by the Spaniards, was buried the 24th of Julie.

It most likely arose from some trifling circum stance now forgotten. Newlyn is somewhat larger than Mousehole, having annexed to it a collection of houses called by a mixture of English and Cornish, \" Street Nowan,\" the New street. Both the towns are provided with a pier capable of shel tering small vessels, and above all of protecting the im mense assemblage of boats employed in the seine fishery, and in driving for pilchards, mackarel, and herrings; from which large supplies, especially of mackarel, are sent in the spring to London, and pilchards exported to the amount of several thousand hogsheads. The principal family of this parish in early times was probably Keigwin. To Mr. John Keigwin, born in 1641, we are indebted for the Translations of Mount Calvary, and of the Creation of the World with Noah's Flood, both of which have been printed by the Editor of this Work, with the original Cornish on the opposite pages; he died about the year 1710. The affairs of the Keigwins got en tangled in family disputes, accompanied by protracted liti gation in the Court of Chancery, which occasioned their estates to be sold in parcels, and thus gave rise to the ex traordinary number of freeholders in the parish of Paul. Mr. Lysons gives the history of several manors, but they do not contain any thing curious. The younger branch of the Godolphins, which settled at Treworveneth, having acquired it by a marriage with the daughter and heiress of John Cowling of that place, be came extinct by the death of Col. William Godolphin in 1689. Trungle was the seat of Mr. Hitchens, and afterwards became the residence of Capt.

His son practised the law at Marazion. The late Mr. John Price commenced the formation of a pretty retreat in a small declivity near the ridge of this parish, at a place called Chi-owne, the house in a croft. Trees were found to flourish there, and the whole promised so much that his son Mr. Rose Price began to lay the founda tion of a handsome seat on an adjoining farm ; and he went so far as to construct an immense mound to act as a shelter for trees, and also to give them an elevation on its slope, a work which the country people named \" The Chi nese Wall:\" the whole was, however, discontinued for want of sufficient space, which was afterwards afforded in the adjacent parish of Maddern by the purchase of Treng wainton. It is not easy to imagine a more beautiful view than the one obtained from the summit of the hill above Newlyn ; the ascent is, however, extremely steep, and in conse quence a new line of road has been projected ; but the great value and subdivision of land will probably defeat the execution of a plan having more for its object the de coration of the country than any facility of communica tion, although that would be found important. Not far from the top of this hill is erected a small stone monument by the late Mr. John Price, to commemorate a circumstance scarcely deserving of such attention, which was no more than the finding of a gold ring with the o o o motto on it, \" In hac spe vivo.\" Mr. Price indeed conjec tured that it had belonged to some gentleman engaged in the remote Plantagenet Civil Wars, aud with much inge nuity contrived a series of adventures to suit the occa sion and the sentiment.

On the barton of Hall are some remains of ancient mili tary works. But the place of greatest note in this parish is Trelawn, for more than two centuries the principal seat of the Tre lawnys; but, notwithstanding the great similarity of the two names, not having any connection one with the other, al though, by a temptation too strong to be withstood, the place has recently been known by the name of its propri etor. THE HISTORY, AS GIVEN BY MR. BOND. This place, at an early period, belonged to the Bodri-"], [308, "294 PELYNT, OR PLYNT. gans. Sir Henry de Bodrigan gave it as a marriage por tion with his daughter to Henry Champernowne. The heiress of this branch of the Champernownes married Pol glass Herle. Sir John Herle the younger, who died with out issue, settled the reversion of Trelawn on Sir William Bonville, the last of an ancient Devonshire family (sum moned to Parliament Sept. the 23d, in the 28th year of Henry the Sixth, as Baron Bonville, which barony in fee became forfeited by the attainder of his great-grandson Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, in the first year of Philip and Mary. Ed.) It was a very remarkable circumstance attending this family, that the havoc of Civil War annihi lated three generations within the space of two months. At the battle of Wakefield Lord Bonville witnessed the death of his son Sir William Bonville, and of his grandson William Lord Harrington, who enjoyed that title accord ing to the custom of those days, as having married Eliza beth, the daughter and heiress of Lord Harrington, of Harrington, possessed of a barony in fee. This battle took place on the last day of December 1460. And in the month of February following the aged grandfather, Lord Bonville himself, was taken prisoner at the second battle of St. Alban's, and although his life had been promised, he was beheaded by the order of Queen Margaret, who bore resent ment against him, as being one of those who had custody of the king's person after the battle of Northampton. Elizabeth Lady Harrington, after the accession of Edward the Fourth, had a large dower assigned her out of Lord Bonville's es tates in Cornwall. Her only daughter by Bonville brought Trelawn, and other estates, to Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset. On the attainder of his grandson Henry Duke of Suffolk, they were seized by the Crown. Queen Eliza beth, in the 42d year of her reign, sold the manor of Tre lawn and the lands of Hendersich and Portello, in Talland prrish, to Sir Jonathan Trelawny. The old and famous family of Trelawny take their name from the barton of Trelawny, in the parish of Alternun. The arms of this"], [309, "PELYNT, OR PLYNT. 295 family are Argent, a chevron Sable, sometimes charged with three oak-leaves Proper. It is said that Sir John Trelawny was so eminent in the wars of France, that King Henry the Fifth, on the 27th of September, in the seventh year of his reign, at Gison in Normandy, granted him \u00a320 yearly for life, as a just re compense for his signal services ; and that Henry the Sixth was pleased to confirm it to him in the first year of his reign, and granted to him an augmentation to his arms, the three oak-leaves. He was certainly the first of this family who bore that addition. Under the picture of Henry the Fifth, which stood formerly on the gate at Launceston, was this rhyme : He that will do aught for me, Let him love well Sir John Trelawnee There was an ancient saying in Cornwall, That a Go dolphin was never known to want wit, a Trelawny courage, or a Glanville loyalty. Mr. Lysons says, Lord Bonville built a castellated mansion at Trelawny, a part of which, with two towers, remain on the eastern side of the present house. Sir John Trelawny nearly rebuilt the house, soon after his purchase of the estate. It was again nearly rebuilt by Edward Trelawny, esq. Go vernor of Jamaica, after a fire, which happened about the middle of the last century. There are several family por traits in the house, two of the Bishop of Winchester; he built a chapel there, on the site of a former one, and the following inscription remains : \" This Chapel was consecrated by the Right Rev. Father in God, Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bart. Lord Bishop of Exeter, en Monday, 23d day of November, Anno Dom. 1701.\" Without adverting to ancient times, two members of this family have been distinguished in times more recent, Doctor Jonathan Trelawny, and one of his sons, Edward Trelawny, esq."], [310, "296 PELYNT, OK PLYNT. Of the first Wood says, in his Athen\u00e6 Oxonienses:\u2014 Jonathan Trelawny, son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, of Trelawny, in Cornwall, Baronet, was born, as I have been informed, at Pelent, or Pelynt, in the same county, edu cated at Westminster School, entered into Christ Church in Michaelmas Term 1668, aged 18 (born therefore in 1650); and in the year following was made student thereof. Afterwards he took the degrees in arts, holy orders, and one or two benefices in his own county, con ferred upon him by his relations. In 1680 his eldest brother died, and thereupon, though ihe title of baronet and the paternal estate of his family were to come to him after the death of his father, yet he stuck to his holy orders, continued in his functions, and upon the translation of Doctor John Lake to the see of Chichester, was nominated Bishop of Bristol by his Ma jesty, (King James the Second, Nov. 8, 1685,) whereupon, after he had been diplomated doctor of divinity, he was consecrated, November the 8th 1685, in the Archbishop's Chapel at Lambeth, and introduced into the House of Lords with Dr. Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on ihe 1 Ith day of the same month. On the 8th of June 1688 he was one of the six Bishops, besides Doctor Sancrott the Archbishop, that were committed prisoners to the Tower of London, for the alleged offence of contriving, making, and publishing a seditious libel against his Majesty and his go vernment; that is for subscribing a petition to his Majesty, wherein he and the rest of the said Bishops showed the great averseness that they found in themselves to the distri buting and publishing in all their churches his Majesty's late declaration for liberty of conscience, &c. Where con tinuing till they were publicly tried in Westminster Hall for the same, they were, to the great joy of the true sons of the Church of England, released thence on the 15th of the same month. Subsequently, however, the see of Exeter was conferred on him by King James, vacant by the trans lation thence to York of Doctor Lamplugh ; and about the"], [311, "297 PELYNT, OR PLYNT. 7th of April following, his Majesty King William the Third was pleased to give his royal assent for him, the said Doctor Jonathan Trelawny, Bishop of Bristol, to be Bishop of Exeter, in the place of Doctor Lamplugh, be forementioned. From the Fasti it appears that Jonathan Trelawny, of Christ Church, was admitted Bachelor of Arts on the 14th of May 1672, and Master of Arts April the 29th, 1675. And on October the 26th, 1685, Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bart. Master of Arts of Christ Church, the nominated Bishop of Bristol, was diplomated Doctor of Divinity. As this gentleman was made Bishop of Bristol by King James the Second, and after his commitment to the Tower and acquittal, accepted from him an appointment to the bishopric of Exeter, almost the last act of that king's go vernment, which appointment was almost immediately con firmed to him by King William on his joining in the Re volution, one may apply in his case the observation made by the most philosophical writer of English history, on the Duke of Marlborough, when he led over Queen Anne to the Prince of Orange. \" This conduct was a singular 'sacrifice to public virtue of every duty in private life, and required for ever after the most upright, disinterested, and public-spirited beha viour to render it justifiable.\" He was further advanced by Queen Anne, being again translated, on the 14th of January 1707, to the see of Winchester. He died on the 21st of June 1721. He married Rebecca, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Hele, esq. of Boscome, in Devonshire, and left a nu merous family, but none of his sons left families, and only two of his daughters; Letitia, who married her cousin Henry Trelawny ; and Rebecca, married to Mr. John Buller, of Morvall. Few men ever obtained so great a share of popularity among all ranks and degrees in his own country as did the Bishop, when he protested against the insidious declara-"], [312, "298 PELYNT, OR PLYNT. tion of King James the Second, and sustained persecution in consequence of the support he had given to the Church of England. Fears were entertained, or apprehensions were industriously circulated, of extremities never contem plated ; and the prompt acquittal of the Bishops seems alone to have prevented Cornwall from rising in arms. A Song was made on the occasion, of which all the exact words, except those of what may be called the burden, were lost, but the whole has recently been restored, modernized, and improved by the Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker, of Whitstone, near Stratton. The strong sensation excited throughout England, by that decisive act of bigotry, tyranny, and imprudence, on the part of King James the Second, by which he com mitted the seven Bishops to the Tower, was in no district more manifestly displayed than in Cornwall, notwithstand ing the part taken by that county in the Civil War. This was, probably, in a great degree occasioned by sympathy with this respected Cornish gentleman, then Bishop of Bristol. The following Song is said to have resounded in every house, in every highway, and in every street. A good sword and a trusty hand, A merry heart and true ; King James's men shall understand What Cornish men can do. And have they fix _ the Where and When ? And shall Trelawny die ?

Bishop Trelawny has left at Christ Church a very valu able, esteemed, and appropriate memorial of himself, and of the Founder. Over the south-east gate of the great quadrangle, leading to the staircase of the hall, is a fine statue of Cardinal Wolsey, with the following inscrip tion : Eminentissimo Cardinali Thom\u00e6 Wolseio, viro inter h\u0153c menia semper memorando, P.

D. M.DCC.XIX. Edward Trelawny, esq. one of the Bishop's sons, had the honour of being made Governor of Jamaica ; and most fortunately for the Island, besides many other prudent and judicious acts, he pacified a formidable body of revolted negroes, who had long sustained a savage independence,"], [314, "300 PELYNT, OR PLYNT. held the fastnesses belonging to the chain of mountains which divides Jamaica throughout its whole length, and maintained a predatory war against all the settlers. The treaty with these people, called Maroons, was in itself so equitable that it continued to be observed up to the period when the whirl of political opinions in Europe, mingled with others of fanatical enthusiasm, extended to these people, and in consequence they were all either extermi nated or sent to perish in distant countries. Sir William Trelawny, the sixth Bart, great-nephew of Edward Trelawny, was also Governor of Jamaica, in less trying times, and the period of his service was cut short by a premature death in 1772, when the property descended to his only son, Harry Trelawny, then a boy at school. The career of this individual, though extraordinary and eccentric, need not be given in any detail. He appears to have been a man of naturally a strong understanding, but having imbibed the spirit of fanaticism in early youth, it carried him in all directions, as fancy guided, with equal facility ; but in general directly against the con sent of modern opinions, which have repudiated implicit confidence in traditions, in the decrees of councils, and in the dicta of ancient fathers, or of popes, substituting in their place the exercise of private judgment; guided no doubt in practice by the teacher who happens to carry with him the fashion of the day. Sir Harry Trelawny commenced preaching at West minster school. He proceeded to Oxford, where in conse quence of nonconformity he could not obtain a degree. He then took orders in the church of Scotland, and be gan a course of preaching in various meeting houses, especially in one of his own erecting at West Looe. In the course of a few years, after the novelty had worn away, he complied with the requisite observances at Oxford and was admitted to a degree. He then received orders as a clergyman of the Church of England from Doctor John Ross, Bishop of Exeter, and soon afterwards the living of St. Allan, which he exchanged with his relation Dr. Wil-"], [315, "301 PELYNT, OR PLYNT. liam Buller, the succeeding Bishop, for Egloshayle. This living he ultimately resigned on becoming a Roman Ca tholic, and died in Italy, February the 25th, 1834, having, as it is said, received the nominal honour from the holy See of being appointed a Bishop in Partibus Infidelium. He married Anne, daughter of the Rev. James Brown, of So mersetshire, and has left a large family. An event connected with the death of this gentleman, and which occurred about a year afterwards, roused the scorn of the whole parish, and of the neighbourhood, more than any thing that has taken place there within the memory of the oldest person. Several priests arrived from the continent, bringing with them an empty coffin, and the various apparatus used in Catholic services, when masses were said and requiems sung at Trelawny for the peace of this individual's soul, who had died and was buried in Italy, where it would seem that these pageants should have been celebrated, on the double supposition of their being really efficacious, and that the Almighty is incapable of hearing them from any other than a single spot.

This parish, with two others, are dedicated to St. Perran, the most distinguished among the missionaries from Ireland, who converted the Pagan inhabitants of Cornwall to the Christian faith ; but his history properly falls under the head of Perran Zabuloe, where he fixed his residence and breathed his last. The church of Perran Arworthall is very small but neat, and it is decorated with a tower in due proportion to the whole fabric. The only ancient village of any consequence in the whole parish, is called Perran Well, probably from the chalybeate spring flowing near it; and this village has imparted its name in common parlance to the whole parish. Perran Well is situated in a deep valley, having a hill and a corresponding vale on either side, terminating in the Carnon branch of Falmouth harbour: over all these the high road leading from Truro to Falmouth used to pass ; but by a most judicious improvement a causeway has been laid over Carnon, and these transverse hills and valleys entirely avoided. Not far below the village stood one of the tin-smelting houses constructed after the Germans introduced reverbe ratory furnaces ; it has been used for the last thirty years for refining arsenic. This metal and its oxide, most destructive to animal or to vegetable life, is extensively useful in metallurgic operations and in the arts. Few sub stances are more generally diffused throughout mining districts : it unites with most other metals, sometimes alone, but more frequently in union with sulphur, and converts them into minerals. Metals are therefore said to be mine ralized by arrenic, by sulphur, &c. The first operation used in extracting metals from their ores, is one for driving off by heat such substances as are volatile. Arsenic is eminently so : it therefore sublimes, and is deposited in long flues or chambers made to prevent the destructive"], [319, "ST. PIRAN, OR PERRAN ARWORTHALL. 305 consequences of its being diffused through the atmosphere, and scattered over the country. From these chambers or flues the refiners of arsenic obtain their supplies, and are thereby enabled to afford it in a state of purity, at such prices as would be wholly inadequate for defraying the expense necessarily to be incurred, if the operation had commenced on the ores containing this metal in the mines. Partly in this parish, but principally in Milor, on the next creek towards Falmouth, are situated the great iron works, conducted by Messrs. Fox, a family distinguished for ability, exertion, and liberality, from generation to generation. These works were the first constructed of any magnitude in Cornwall. Previously, all the cast-iron mate- rials for steam engines were brought from Glamorganshire, and the working of an important mine very frequently depended on the uncertain direction of the wind; now every thing that can be required, even cylinders of the largest dimensions, seven feet and a half (90 in.) in diameter, and ten or twelve feet long, are cast and bored with the utmost accuracy here and at Hoyle, where similar works have arisen, to the incalculable benefit of the mining con cerns. The valley above and below these works is perhaps the most beautiful in the west of Cornwall, and it has recently been adorned, just opposite the fine woods of Carclew, by the elegant and tasteful residence of Benjamin Sampson, esq. who conducts an extensive manufactory for supplying the mines with gunpowder made in their immediate neigh bourhood. This parish, and the adjacent one of Stithyans, to which it is annexed, are believed to have been appropriated to the religious establishment at Penrey. The impropriation of the great tithes, and the advowson of the vicarage, have for a considerable time belonged to the Boscawens of Tre gothnan. Perran Arworthall measures 1,229 statute acres. VOL.

THE EDITOR. The church and the tower of this parish are small, but distinguished for their simple and neat appearance. They are situated with the church town in a valley opening to the sea. In the church is a plain memorial of Mr. Henry Davies, great-uncle to the editor, who died in 1737. Two of his relations, Mr. Davies father and son, were successive rectors of this parish, through the bounty of the Trevelyan family. And it may be a matter of some curiosity to insert the oath administered a century ago to clergymen taking on themselves the office of Dean Rural, or Decanus Episcopus. The oath is now omitted, but the office itself has been uniformly preserved throughout the Diocese of Exeter, and this useful institution is revived in various parts of the kingdom. The copy was found by the editor at Tredrea, his place in Cornwall, among other old papers. TENOR JURAMENTI Decani Episcopi, in Comitatu Cornubi\u00e6 et Di\u0153cesi Exoniensi.

There are several good farm houses in the parish, for merly the residences of gentlemen ; but, excepting the church town, only one place deserving the name of a vil lage, which is Goldsithney, commonly pronounced Gul zinney, lying on the road from Redruth to Marazion. In this village was formerly a chapel dedicated to St."], [323, "PERRAN UTHNO, OR LITTLE PERRAN. 309 James, as Doctor Borlase has ascertained from documents in the cathedral at Exeter. No memory remains of this chapel having ever been used for divine service ; but within the editor's recollection a small image might be seen over the door, said by the inhabitants to be St. Perran ; but if the records consulted by Doctor Borlase are correct, more probably of St. James. Mr. Lysons mentions the fair which is annually holden here on the fifth of August, St. James's day, by the old style ; and he also takes notice of a tale, which the editor has heard a thousand times, of the fair having been originally kept in the church town of Sithney, near Helston, by vir tue of a glove, which was annually displayed there, till the men of Perran, by force or cunning, or by proposing to exchange new gloves for old ones, bore off the talisman, and have by its authority held the fair at Goldsithney ever since, paying one shilling every year as a poor compen sation to the party bereaved. It is needless to add that this tale, as it is related, cannot be true; but the names Sithney and Goldsithney, with the payment to the churchwardens of the parish, seem to indi cate some relation between the parish and this village. The displaying of a glove at fairs is an ancient and widely extended custom. Mr. Lysons says it is continued at Chester. The editor has seen a large ornamented glove displayed on a lofty pole over the Guild Hall at Exeter, during the fairs. Was the glove used to receive the tolls, as shillings are still collected in some courts of justice; or had il any reference to hand payments on delivery, as is usual in fairs; or has it a more noble origin in chivalry? A cove is pointed out in Perran, where the ancestor of the Trevelyans is said to have been borne on shore by the strength of his horse, from the destruction of the Lionesse country, west of the Land's End. The Trevelyan family are too old, too honourable, and now too much distin guished by science, for them to covet any addition of honour through the medium of fabulous history. It is recorded in the Saxon Chronicle, that in the year"], [324, "310 PERRAN UTHNO, OR LITTLE PERRAN. 1099, on St. Martin's day, there was so very high a tide, and the damage so great in consequence, that men remem bered not the like to have ever happened before, and the same day was the first of the new moon. Stow, who wrote his History of England about the year 1580, notices the great tide of 1099, when he says, The sea brake in over the banks of the Thames and other ryvers, drowning many towns, and much people, with innumerable numbers of oxen and sheepe ; at which time the lands in Kent, that sometime belonged to Duke Godwyne, Earle of Kent, were covered with sandes and drowned, which are to this day called Godwyne Sandes. On the slender founda tion of these alluvial catastrophies, Florence of Worcester either invented, or with more than monkish credulity, received the tale of a whole district being ingulphed; not at some remote geological period, but in what may be con sidered as the recent times of anthentic history, after the existence of systematic registers, and records ; a district, covered as he states, by a city, and by a hundred and forty churches, with their accompanying villages, farms, &c. an event that must have shaken the whole of Europe : and, to increase the wonder, a gentleman accidentally on horseback, is carried by this animal to the neighbouring shore of W7hit send Bay, or twenty miles further off, to Perran, through a sea which had swallowed an entire country, and from which the largest of modern vessels could not by possibility have escaped. This idle tale, related by one writer after another, has almost reached our own times. The editor remembers a female relation of a former vicar of St. Erth, who, in structed by a dream, prepared decoctions of various herbs, and repairing to the Land's End, poured them into the sea, with certain incantations, expecting to see the Lionesse country rise immediately out of the water, having all its inhabitants alive, notwithstanding their long submersion. But Perchance some form was unobserved, Perchance in prayer or faith she swerved ; \u2014 no countrv apDeared, and, although the love of marvel-"], [325, "PERRAN UTHNO, OR LITTLE PERRAN. 311 lous events and of tales exciting the passions, seems not to have diminished in recent times, yet the editor is unaware of any subsequent attempt having been made to rescue those unfortunate people from their protracted state of suspended animation. Perran Uthnow has to boast of but one modern addition to its residences. About the year 1775, the late Mr. John Shakspeare of Pendarves, built a house similar to the one previously erected by Mr. Stephens at Tregorne, and gave it the name of the family with which he was connected by his marriage. About half a mile beyond this house, called Acton Cas tle, Cudden Point projects into the sea, entirely covered with rock, and affording, in many respects, the most pleas ing view of any spot in the whole Bay. From St. Michael's Mount itself, the feature transcendent above all others is lost; but from Cudden all the western objects are seen, without including the long flat land of the Lizard. Children from all the neighbourhood are in the habit of going to Cudden Point at the low water of spring tides, with the hope of finding a silver table, although they know not why. It appears, however, that a Spanish vessel, hav ing much bullion on board, was wrecked there in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The addition of Uthno made to this saint's name, desig nates a manor within the parish; there is also a manor called Lan Uthno, in St. Erth, distinguished in former times as the parish of Lan Uthno ; but the editor has never been able to form any conjecture respecting the meaning or the etymology of this word. The parish feast is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to the fifth of March, St. Perran's Day. This parish measures 924 statute acres.

This great increase of Population is owing to Perran having become a mining parish, and to the cultivation of an extensive piece of waste ground by individuals, construct ing houses on portions of land not exceeding one or two acres, granted on leases for their lives. A spot on this for merly open ground, was called Chapel an Crouse, the chapel and cross ; but no record nor trace remains of any such an establishment. Near the same place a bowling green existed about fifty years ago, which is said to have been frequented fifty years prior to that period, by all the gentlemen of the neighbourhood.

All the lands in this parish, except the manor of Penhall and Halwyn, are either part of or held from the manors of Tywarnhaile and Tywarnhaile Tiers. I shall, therefore, first treat of these two manors, and then of the other most memorable places, &c. The manor of Tywarnhaile is so called from the situation of the once principal place in it, and signifies a house on a river of salt water, it being seated on the west side of Piran Bay, on a small river to which the tide cometh every day. This, and the manor of Tywarnhaile Tiers, were ori ginally but one manor ; and the toll of tin is still amain between them, though all the lands are divided, and the"], [328, "314 PERRAN ZABULOE. toll of all other metals goes with the lands and owners of the several divisions; but the royalty is amain, and they both hold courts cum visu franci plegii, &c. THE MANOR OF TYWARNHAILE TIERS. Sir Henry le Tyes, Lord Tyes, or (as Mr. Camden calls him) de Tiers, was lord of the manor. Not far from Tywarnhaile house is a small island, upon which are the ruins of a chapel, called Chapel Angarder. The manor of Penwortha, alias Penwartha, I take to signify the higher head or hill, according to its situation in regard to the places adjacent. The ancient lords of this manor were the Pentires of Pentire in Minvor, and of Pentewan in Mevagissey ; the last of whom, Philip Pentire, esq. left one daughter and heir, Jane, married to Thomas Roscarrock, esq. which Jane died possessed of this manor, 5 Jac. I. 1607 (rent of Tywarnhaile-Tiers, penes me Thomas Tonkin). In Pen wortha village is an old chapel still standing, but profaned. This manor is held from that of Tywarnhaile-Tiers, at \u00a31. 2s. rent yearly. Roscarrock, esq. sold this manor in 16 Car. I. to Sir Francis Vyvyan of Trelowarren, knt. in whose poste rity it still continueth, Sir Francis Vyvyan, bart. being the present lord thereof. There have been small parcels of tin discovered in the north-west parts of this manor, as also a vein of lead some few years since, between the village of Penwortha and Lambrigan; but neither have turned to any account. Lambourne- Wigan, vulgo Lambrigan, is adjoining to Penwortha, and commonly called by abbreviation Lambri gan. The meaning of Lambourn is Lam or Lan, an inclosure, and Wigan, the same as Vycan, Vean, little ; the little Lambourn, to distinguish it from the other. This estate is likewise held from the manor of Tywarnhaile- Tyes, and has passed through the same hands as the manor"], [329, "PERRAN ZABULOE. 315 of Penwortha, for two-thirds of it, of which Sir Francis Vyvyan is now lord. The other third, commonly called the Lower Town, one Bartholomew de Trewenethick (Trenethick in St. Agnes) did possess one half of, in the 21st of Richard II. ; which, together with Trevanythick, &c. he settled on Joan, his daughter and heir, and John Hayme : which, by their grand-daughter and heir, came to Luke Beauchamp of Chyton, and was, I suppose, sold by Peter Beauchamp, to the ancestor of Francis Gregor of Trewarthenick, who now possesseth it. The other sixth, or half of the said third, came through several hands, which I have not been able to get a true account of, to one Thomas Carter, of Dartmouth in Devon, and he sold it 22 Car. I. to John Tregea of St. Agnes, who haxing acquired a pretty estate by tin, and taken a lease of Vyvyan's two thirds, and Gregor's sixth, settled himself here, and began to build upon it ; but, dying soon after, he left it to finish to his son, Captain William Tregea ; who having married Mary, the daughter of Richard Cross of Bromfield, in Somerset, esq. by whom he had no surviving issue, he soon after her death run out a handsome estate, partly left him by his father, and partly of his own acquir ing; and in 1694 sold his right in this barton to Michael Tonkin of Penwenick, gent. ; after which he went into the army, and was some time a captain in the late Lord Mo hun's regiment. He died in London or near it in 1730, and gave for his arms, Azure, three boar's heads couped Argent. Michael Tonkin parted with it again in 1702, to the writer hereof, who had settled himself here on his marriage in 1699, where he lived during his father's life, being as plea sant a seat as any in those parts, especially for all country exercises of hunting, fishing, and fowling, the fine downs round it, and the moors under, abounding in game."], [330, "316 PERRAN ZABULOE. THE MANOR OF LAMBOURN. To the east of Lambrigan and contiguous, is Lambourn, which gives name to this lordship, and which is held partly from Tywarnhaile, and partly from Tywarnhaile Tyes. I take the name to be a softening of Lan ABron, the hill in closure, and so it is written in old deeds, and the situation agrees with it. This was the seat, and gave name to a considerable and knightly family. Sir John de Lambron, temp. Hen. III. (Exeter Reg.) gave Caerkief, in this parish, to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, and they still enjoy it. John de Lambron (Carew, sol. 51) was one of the men ad arma, 17 Edw. II. Sir John de Lambron, (idem, sol. 52) I sup- pose his son, was one of those who had \u00a320 lands of rents or more, in the county of Cornwall, 25 Edw. III. (as the former John is certified to have had \u00a340) ; and was sum- moned to attend the King at London, the next Sunday after the Octave of St. John the Baptist, and to go with him in the parts beyond sea. The next that I meet with, and the last of his family, was William Lamborn (Heralds' Office) who had only one daughter and heir, married temp. Henry V. to Sir John Arundell of Lanhearne, and called Amara, who brought the whole estate into that family. Their arms were, Argent, a sess between two chevrons Sable. Sir John Arundell gave this manor, inter alia, to their third son Sir Renfry Arundell; who, by Joan the daugh- ter and heir of Sir John Colshull, knight, (killed at the battle of Agincourt, Oct. 25, 1415,) had one son, Renfry, and one daughter, Elizabeth, married : 1. to William Whittington, esq. ; 2. to Edmund Stradling, esq. Ren- fry Arundell had only one son, Sir Edmund Arundell, knight, who died without issue, leaving his aunt Elizabeth his heir ; who, by her second husband Edmund Stradling, had only one daughter, Ann, married to Sir John Danvers, knight. Between whom, and her eldest son (by her first"], [331, "317 PERRAN ZABULOE. husband) John Whittington, esq. she divided her large estate, no less than thirteen good manors of land. This manor, by this division, falling into two hands, the mansion house fell by degrees into decay, the stones of it were employed to build several mean houses for tenants (for it is now a village), and nothing remains but the chapel dedicated to St. Edmund, now too turned to a dwelling, and part of the wall of the chapel yard, now a garden, but formerly a burying place. There was likewise in it lately a font. From all which I gather, it was a place of pub lic worship, perhaps sometimes served by the vicar (on account of the said donation of Caerkief), by reason of its great distance from the church, being at least three miles. [Caerkief was probably given by the Lambrons, for leave to erect this chapel, which appears to have been a chapel of ease to the parish church, but was erected for the use of the Lambrons, their servants, and their tenants.] Thomas Whittington, esq. grandson of William Whittington, and Elizabeth Arundell, died 38 Henry VIIL (Dugdale's War wickshire, page 619), leaving six daughters and coheiresses, whereof Blanche, the youngest, became the wife of John St. Aubin of Clewance, esq. ; and some of them, though all married, dying without issue, her posterity became intituled to one fifth and one sixtieth of all the Cornish lands ; and this part of this manor is in the possession of Sir John St. Aubyn, bart. The remaining part of Whit tington's moiety, was sold by the other coheirs to Davy of St. Cuthbert, gent, whose posterity enjoyed it till the latter end of the reign of Charles II. when Davy sold his part to Humphry Borlace, esq., and this went with a great part of his estate (as you may see in Newlin) to Sir William Scawen, knight, whose nephew, Thomas Scawen, is now lord thereof. Danvers his moiety continued in his family till Queen Elizabeth's time, when Sir John Danvers of Dantesey in Wiltshire, knight, dismembered and sold it in several parcels : \u2014 viz. 18 Elizabeth, 1577, one half of a tenement m."], [332, "318 PERRAN ZABULOE.

Another part of a tenement, being one fourth of the town of Lambourne, [was sold by Sir John Danvers] much about the same time to Oats, whose son John Oats sold it to the ancestor of Francis Gregor of Trewarthenick, esq. who now enjoys it ; and the remaining one twelfth part (which maketh up his half of the said town), together with all his claim to the one half of the lordship of Lambourne, and its appurtenances, (Aut. penes Authorem) to Edward Arundell of Lanherne, esq.

Where note that the said Thomas Oats, a wealthy farmer in the said village, (great-grandson to John Oats, who owned one fourth, now Mr. Gregor's,) I have reason to think (Aut. penes Authorem, at orig. pen. Thomas Oats) descended from Otho Trefusis, who released his right in villa de Trelisick (in St. Earth) to John Corn wall, 7 Junii, 28 Henry VI. ; from which Otho or Oats his posterity took the name of Oats, as was then^very common to do ; and have, therefore, in my map of the hundred of Pider, set the arms of Trefusis (which I think he may law fully give) over his name."], [333, "319 PERRAN ZABULOE. The said Richard Bluet and Elizabeth nis wife, soon after, viz. 30 Maii, 1650, sold the half of this manor, and what remained indisposed of, which was only one half of Millinoweth, alias Vellonnoweth [the New Mill], and Nampetha, with Goynlase in St. Agnes, and a small part in Fenton Vease [the outward well] and Collrun in this parish, with a few high rents, unto Walter Vincent of Tri gowethan, esq. ; which, as the rest of the Vincent's estates, is gone (as you may see in Mevagissey) to John Knight, who, Sir John St. Aubin, and Thomas Scawen, esq. are the present lords of this manor. In the commons belonging to the town of Lambourn, is a Barrow, called Creeg AMLear, the Great Burrow, which one Christopher Michell digging into some years since, whilst I lived at Lambrigan, in hopes to find stones for an adjoining hedge of his, came to an hollow place (as usual in such), and found nine urns full of ashes; which, being disappointed of what he sought for, for the barrow was all of earth, except three or four rough stones which formed the hollow, he brutally broke immediately to pieces ; and when I expostulated with him about it, and told him I would have paid him his charges, his reply was, that when ever he met with any more, he would bring them to me, but these were a parcel of old pitchers good for nothing. That these were Danish, I believe there is no doubt. [They were British, as appears at once, from the Kist Vaen discovered within, and from the hinted badness of the pottery. But they were] I suppose, the ashes of some chief commanders slain in battle, (for which the place is very fit, it being a large open down) from the great num ber of them. [One barrow cannot mark a battle.] And on a small hill just under this barrow, [and, as under the barrow, bearing probably no relation to it], is a Danish encampment, called Castle Caer Dane, vulgo Castle Caer Don, i. e. the Danes' Camp, consisting of three intrench ments finished, and another begun with an intent to sur round the inner three, but not completed ; the whole con-"], [334, "320 PERBAN ZABULOE. taining about acres. And opposite to this, about a bowshot, the river only running between, on another hill, is another camp or castle, called Castle Kaerkief, castrum simile, from Kyfel, similis, alike, -alluding to Castle Caer dane. But this is but just begun, and not finished in any part; from whence I guess, that there were too different parties, of which the first attacked the other, before they could finish their intrenchments : or perhaps these attacked the first, having only thrown up a few intrenchments for the present, on which a battle ensuing, these were the ashes of the chief men that fell in it. And this being called Creeg Mear, the Great Barrow, seems to carry a more special regard with it. This Castle Caerkief is on the estate which the forementioned Sir John de Lambron gave to the church at Exeter, and no doubt had its name from this fortification. [These opposed camps have no other pretence to a Danish origin, than what a Cornish critic should be ashamed to Own, the mere coincidence in sound of Din or Dines with Danish. This is the sole foundation for all the Danish camps, with which the antiquarian oscitancy of Cornwall has replenished the county. All built upon hills, they naturally take the name of Din, Dinas, or Don, in Cornish, to denote their site ; and while the common peo ple, unseduced by the surmises of literature, still retain the name in its original purity, the scholars come forward and mould it to their own follies. We see this very livelily in the name of the former of these two camps, which the com mon people call Caer Don, but the critic writes it Caer Dane, and then interprets into the Danes' camp, but it signifies only the hill fortress. Opposed to this, on another hill, and beyond a rivulet, is another camp, which is called Caerkief, the companion or mate of the other. Kyfel, says Mr. Tonkin, signifying similar or like in Cornish, Kyvedk (C.) being a fellow, or colleague, Kyvadhas (C.) a com panion, and Kuf (C.) a wife, Cyfaill, Cyfailt (W.) a friend, a companion, and Cyfalle, (W.) a husband or wife, a part-"], [335, "321 PERRAN ZABULOE. ner, a fit match. The very opposition of the camps is thus denoted in the name. But then Caer Don is considered as the principal, and Caer Kief has its appellation from its relation to that. They are a British and a Roman camp. The Roman appears from the smallness, lying \"on a small hill,\" from the finished state of its intrenchments, from its having no less than three, and from its having even a fourth begun, to encircle all. These marks of military attention and of patient industry, all unite to point it out decisively for a Roman one. Nor has the other a signature less lively of its British origin ; it is \"but just begun, and not finished in any part.\" The Romans, probably seeing the Britons begin to fortify their ground, desisted from their fourth work, marched out of their own camp, and attacked the Britons in theirs, before they could form it; and in this view of the camps, the barrow, which is over the Roman, and not between it and the British, could have no reference to either, and was only the tomb of some family residing in the vale below. Whitaker.] Next to Lambourne, and within the manor, which ex tends itself over several parishes, (Treluddro in Newlyn being held from it) is a great village called Callestock Veor, or the Great Callestock, to distinguish it from ano ther in this parish, which is by interpretation hard broad oak, (though stock properly signifies the \u00abtem or stock of a tree,) which formerly grew here in great abundance, though there are now but few remaining. Here lately lived a younger branch of the Tebbots, vulgo Tippets, of St. Wen ; the last of which, John Tippet, had an estate of \u00a3100 per annum, partly fee, partly lease, which he chiefly spent in law, and was in his old age, more than 90, maintained by the parish : he died about 1712. As likewise, as appears by the confirmed rate 1612, one Mr. Torr; but I can at pre sent say no more of him for want of better information. There are in the commons of this village some remaining intrenchments, but not worthy of notice. But at a place, also within this manor, about three quarters of a mile from it, VOL. III. Y"], [336, "322 PERRAN ZABULOE. called Tresawsen, alias Bosawsen, i. e. the English town or dwelling, on the top of the hill to the south of the village, is a double Danish intrenchment, of which the outer one has been almost filled up by often ploughing, but the inner one is very entire, and they both contain about an acre of land. It bath no particular name that I know of, but is within sight of Castle Caer Dane, from which it is distant about two miles. And from this you see another in St. Allen, about the same distance from this ; vide St. Allen. [Tresawen, alias Bosawsen, from Tre and Boss (C.) a house, and Saisson, Saxon, or English, is evidently from its name, not Danish, but Saxon. It is a Saxon fort, constructed on the reduction of the West of Cornwall by Athelstan, and maintained as a bridle and a curb upon the natives ; and it seems to mark the advance of the Saxon arms from Camelford, where Egbert gained his great victory over the Cornish, to St. Burien's, from which Athelstan probably embarked for, and at which he certainly landed on his return from reducing the Scilly Isles.] Having taken notice of the most remarkable things in this manor (for I have spoken of the three barrows and four barrows in Kenwin, only I forgot to mention, that in the middle of Callestock stood a chapel, of which the very ruins are now scarce visible ; and that in Caerkief, near the highway to Mitchell, is a fair arched well called Fenton Berran, i. e. St. Piran's Well,) I come next to The Manor of Fenton Gymps, which takes its name from its capital place, Fenton Gymps Veor, or the Great Fen ton Gymps; which adjunct, Gymps, is a contraction of Thesympes, not intermitting, [and means] the well that always flows, as not freezing in winter, or dying [drying] in the summer. And such a one there is in the town place of the manor house. [The aim of the etymon is very right here, I believe ; but the manner in which it is directed is wrong. Adjoined to the word Fenton, and explained by the existing reality, Gymps assuredly means what Mr. Tonkin says, not intermitting, but always flowing. But"], [337, "PERRAN ZABULOE. 323 how does Gymps signify this ? That it is a contraction of thesympes can hardly be allowed. The contraction is too violent. Thesympes also signifies nothing but immediately in Borlase, which can have no association with the general idea. Whence then shall we derive the word ? WTe have it without any derivation, and without any contraction, in Kympez (C.) always. And Dr. Pryce I since find so derives the word.] This gave name to an ancient race of gentlemen. John de Fentongemps (Aut. pen. Author.) lived here 21 Edward I. [Edward III.] 1346. John Fen tongymps, \" D'nus et h\u00e6res de Fentongympys,\" grants to John, the son of Ralph de Fentongympys, all his messuages lands, &c. in Fentongympis, and elsewhere, in the county of Cornwall ; dated the Feast of the Purification, 12 Henry IV. John Fentongemps of the parish of Pirran in Treth (the sand) grants to John, the son of Thomas Martin, a lease for term of years of Marghessen-foos (Marasan vose) in the said parish, dated at Marghessen-foos, in festo Petri et Pauli, 3 Henry VI. Note. That Marghessen-foos, or Marasan-vose, i. e. the Maids' Market, is a village in the manor of Fenton-gymps in Piran sands, but why so named I cannot guess, except that, being in the great road to Mitchell, the maids came there to offer themselves in service, a custom taken notice of, particularly by Dr. Plot, Nat. Hist, of Oxf. c. 8, 29, p. 208 ; but not (that I know of) practised now anywhere in this county. [Mr. Tonkin has here misled himself by an etymon forced and false. He considers soos or vose as M6z a maid. But the name is merely this, Marghes or Marhas an Fos or V6s, the market on the ditch or trench. Fos, indeed, Borlase interprets wall, and has this very- appellation, Marhas an Fos, which he renders the market on wall, obviously without any sense. But under Vos he recollects himself\u2014\" Vos for fos;\" he then says, \" a ditch, wall, or fence,\" as Penvos, head of the trench, Marhas an Vos, the market on the foss.\" Dr. Pryce adopts both these etymons in his vocabulary, and prefers the former in his Y 2"], [338, "324 PERRAN ZABULOE names very injudiciously. From this name the village appears to have been formerly a market town. The market was perhaps held on some boundary ditch, and took its name from it ; but in all probability, as \" being in the great road to Mitchell,\" it lay upon a Roman road, which, like the great road from Lincolnshire to Bath, and through Somersetshire to the south or west, bore the appel lation of foss ; and very probably the Foss itself is continued by Stratton, Camelford, Wadebridge, and St. Columb, direct by Newlyn into Piran parish, Lamburn, Lambrigan, Marghessan-fos, and White Street there. See the map in Borlase.

The next that I find possessed of any right here, are Richard Penwarne, esq. and William Wayte of Trewenethick, gent. Wayte sells his part to Henry Dotson of Roskymer in Mawgan Meneg, gent.

I must go backwards now, and come to the manor of Trevellance, alias Pencaranowe, id est, Pen-Carnow, the hill of rocks.

The name appears below to be Trefelens ; and Trevelin is the house of the mill.] was the dwelling house of Mr. William Trefelens (so writ by the error [when it appears below to be no error] of the scribe) which, 12 Henry VIIL he settled by the name of Trefelens, Penkara nowe, Trevelles, Polleowe, Coysgarne, the rights and ser vices in Nampara, and the rents and services in Runewar tha, on Ralph John, cler. He sold it to William Tregea of St. Agnes; who in 16 . ., was forced to sell it to pay his debts, to John Tho mas in 1694; whose father Thomas, was of the Thomases [a later hand has added, of Glamorganshire in Wales ; he was the younger son of Howel Thomas of Gla morganshire, by the daughter of Sir Robert Burt of Pembrokeshire] ; whose son John Thomas, gent, [he died in 1733, and his son Andrew Thomas, gent, hath the whole estate,] having married Jane, [in a later hand Anne,] the only surviving daughter and heir of Mr. John Andrew of Trewellance, will, after his decease, have in conjunction with his own, a pretty estate in this parish. Mr. Thomas's arms are [N.B. in a later hand, Gules, a chevron and canton Ermine.] To the east of Penkaranowe, and joining with it, is Reenwartha, the higher hill, to distinguish it from another"], [341, "PERRAN ZABULOE. 327 called Reen Wollas, the Lower Hill [R-hyn (W.) a moun tain or promontory, Ryn (C.) a bill, a nose, Rynen (C.) a hillock.

This was sold by the said R. Haweis to Cottey, whose grandson, Christopher Cottey, gent, now enjoys it ; but one fifth part of it distinct from the other, as also one fifth part of Hendrawna and Nampara (all within the manor) were the lands of inherit ance of Hugh Jackman, gent.; and by him sold about the year 1 670, to Walter Vincent of Truro, esq. who (Aut. pen. Author.) Feb. 22, 1678, conveyed them to John Cat cher of St. Clement's, i-eserving to himself the tin and royalty. From Catcher they came to Henry Gregor of Truro, merchant, whose grandson, Samuel Ennys, esq. now enjoys them. After the said Reginald Haweis had dismembered it thus, he sold the lordship and the little that was left, one fifth of Trevelles in St. Agnes, and some trifle more, to the said Walter Vincent, which is gone, with the rest of the estate, to Mr. Knight. This manor, and the several estates therein, are held partly from Tywarnhaile, and partly from Tywarnhaile Tiers. Note, that between Reen Wollas and Trevellance runs a fine rivulet, which in the winter season overflowing its banks, and making the passage over it very dangerous, occasioned a county bridge of two arches of stone, and a long causeway, with a smaller arch at the eastern end of it, to be constructed in 170S, chiefly procured by the writer hereof (several people having been drowned here, it being a great thoroughfare), who was at the general sessions appointed treasurer for the building it; this is called Me lingybridge, from the adjacent village of Melingay, i.e. the mill in the river [that is, the water mill,] under which are"], [342, "328 PERRAN ZABULOE. fine moors for fowling and fishing, .abounding with all sorts of wild fowls, and peal, salmon, shots, eels, and flounders. THE MANOR OF ST. PIRAN Lyeth joining to the east, with Penkaranowe and Reen Wartha between them, and the church lands of St. Piran, from whom it takes its name. This is now wholly destroyed by the sands, but was once the seat of a family of the same name : by a daughter of one of which it came to the Rendalls of Pelint; and by Elizabeth, the only daughter and heir of Walter Rendall of Lostwithiel, to her husband, Henry Vincent of Tresim ple, whose son Walter Vincent, esq. claimed a free warren here under the Duke of Cornwall. It hath some good tin works in it, but so chargeable, by reason of the depth of sand, that they do not turn to much account, and are gone with the rest of the estate as above. This manor is in Carew, sol. 46, rated at three acres Cornish, 12 Edward I. At the back side of this manor, to the south, is a large down or wastrel!. [N. B. here a page 460 e. is lost ; and since I saw it last, I think. But from the marginal note, \" Piran Round,\" it contained a description of that Cornish amphitheatre.] THE EDITOR. It is rather a curious circumstance that the word Zabuloe added to Perran, for the distinction of this parish, is not derived from the Celtic, but through the French sable from sabulum, a word frequently used by Pliny as indica tive of sand or gravel. Unfortunately, some leaves are wanting from Mr. Ton kin's manuscript of this parish, so that no account is sound in it, either of the amphitheatre, or of the consecrated well which belongs to Perran Zabuloe ; although, by a singular anomaly, the Perran in Kerrier bears the name as an"], [343, "PERRAN ZABULOE. 329 addition, at least in common parlance. Doctor Borlase has given a description and a plan of this curious Round, as it is usually called, in his work on the Natural History of Cornwall, printed at Oxford in 1758, where, at p. 298, he says : \u2014 The area of the amphitheatre is perfectly level, and about one hundred and thirty feet in diameter. The benches, seven in number, rise eight feet from the area. The top of the rampart is seven feet wide ; it slopes exter nally into a foss, which rises by another slope to the level of the country. There is a circular pit nearly in the cen tre, thirteen feet in diameter, and three feet deep, the sides also sloping. Half way down is a bench of turf, so formed as to reduce the bottom to an ellipsis ; and a shallow trench four feet six inches wide, and one foot deep, runs in an easterly direction to the nearest part of the circle, where it terminates in a semi-oval cavity extending eleven feet from north to south, and nine feet from east to west, making a breach in the' benches.\" This and other similar works in Cornwall, are believed to have accommodated great numbers of spectators when the Guary Mir, or miracle plays, were performed. One of them, mentioned by Doctor Borlase, \" The Creation of the World,\" with Mr. Keigwyn's Translation, the editor of this work has given to the public, and also the M etrical History of the Passion of our Saviour on Mount Calvary. The well consecrated by St. Perran is not understood to possess any peculiar qualities, but up to the present time its waters, accompanied by the ceremony of passing children through the cleft of a rock on the sea shore, are believed to cure various diseases, and particularly the rickets. The encroachments of the sand have caused no less than three churches to be built after considerable intervals of time in this parish. The last was commenced in 1804 ; and in this year (1835) a building has been discovered more ancient than the first of the churches, and not improbably the oratory of St. Perran himself. The length of this chapel within the walls is 25 feet,"], [344, "330 PERRAN ZABULOE without 30 feet; the breadth within 12\u00a3 feet, and the height of the walls the same. At the eastern end is a neat altar of stone covered with lime, sour feet long by two and a half feet wide, and three feet high. Eight inches above the centre of the altar is a recess in the wall, where probably stood a crucifix; and on the north side of the altar is a small doorway through which the priest may have entered. Out of the whole length the chancel extended exactly six feet. In the centre of what may be termed the nave, in the south wall, occurs a round-arched doorway, highly ornamented. The building is however without any trace of window, and there is only one small opening, apparently, for the admission of air. The discovery has excited much curiosity throughout the neighbourhood, which has unfortunately manifested itself by the demolition of every thing curious in this little oratory, to be borne away as relics. Very little is known concerning the saint who has given his name to the three Perrans. He is however held in great veneration, and esteemed the patron of all Cornwall, or at least of the mining district. By an anachronism of fifteen hundred years or more, he was considered as the person who first sound tin ; and this conviction induced the miners to celebrate his day (the fifth of March) with so much hilarity, that any one unable to guide himself along the road, has received the appellation of a Perraner; and that again, has been most unjustly reflected as a habit on the saint. It may here be worthy of remark, that, as the miners im pute the discovery of tin to St. Perran, so they ascribe its reduction from the ore, in a large way, to an imaginary personage, Saint Chiwidden ; but chi-wadden is the white house, and must therefore mean a smelting or blow- o ing house, where the black ore of tin is converted into a white metal. In the Lives of the Saints, published by Doctor Butler, where all rrjiraculous adventures, like swimming on mill-"], [345, "331 PERRAN ZABULOE. stones, are carefully omitted, the following history is given of our saint. \" St Kiaran or Kenerin, Bishop and Confessor, called by the Britons, Piran or Perron. \" Among the Irish saints, who were somewhat older than St. Patrick, the first and most celebrated is St. Kiaran, whom the Irish style the first-born of their saints. Accord ing to some, he was a native of the county of Ossory, according to others, of Cork. Usher places his birth about the year 352. Having received some imperfect informa tion about the Christian faith, at thirty years of age, he took a journey to Rome, that he might be instructed in its heavenly doctrine, and learn faithfully to practice its pre cepts. He was accompanied home by four holy clerks, who were all afterwards bishops ; their names are Lugacius, Columban, Lugad, and Cassan. \" The Irish writers suppose him to have been ordained Bishop at Rome; but what John of Tinmouth affirms seems far more probable, that he was one of the twelve whom St. Patrick consecrated Bishops in Ireland, to assist him in planting the Gospel in that island. For his residence he built himself a cell in a place encompassed with woods, near the water of Fueran, which soon grew into a numerous monastery. A town was afterwards built there, called Saigar, now from the saint Sier Keran. Here he con- verted to the faith his family, and his whole clan, which was that of the Osraigs, with many others. Having given the religious veil to his mother, whose name was Lidain, he appointed her a cell or monastery near his own, called by the Irish Ceall Lidain. In his old age, being desirous o prepare himself for his passage to eternity in close tretirement, he passed into Cornwall, where he led an eremitical \"life, near the Severn sea, fifteen miles from Pad stow. Certain disciples joined him, and by his words and example, formed themselves to a true spirit of Christian piety and humility. In this place he closed his mortal pil grimage by a happy death. A town upon the spot is to this"], [346, "332 PERRAN ZABULOE. day called from him St. Piran's in the Sands; and a church is there dedicated to God in his memory, where was for merly a sanctuary near St. Mogun's church, upon St. Mogun's Creek.* See John of Tinmouth, Usher, &c. col lected by Henschenius ; also Leland's Collectanea, published by Hearne, torn. III. pp. 10 and 174.\" It seems to be much more probable, that St. Perran took an active part with the Irish missionaries, perhaps as their chief, since he obtained such great celebrity in this county, than, according to Doctor Butler, that he should have come over to Cornwall in extreme old age, and have done his utmost to render the remaining years of his life ut terly useless to the service of his Maker or to mankind. A white cross on a black ground was formerly the banner of St. Perran, and the standard of Cornwall ; probably with some allusion to the black ore and the white metal of tin. Capgrave says that St. Perran attained an age exceeding two hundred years. In the new edition of Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. VI. p. 1449, an account is given of a college supposed to have been here ; but, excepting that the church was given by King Henry the First to the Bishop and Church of Exeter, who still enjoy the great tithes and the advowson of the vicarage, it clearly refers to the college dedicated to St. Perran in the parish of Keverne. The shrine of St. Perran, however, containing his head and other relics, was at this place ; Lysons quotes a deed in the registry of Exeter, showing the great resort of pilgrims hither in 1485; and in the will of Sir John Arundell 1433, occurs this bequest: \" Item lego ad usum parochie S'c'i Pyerani in Zabulo ad claudendum capud S.

This parish takes its name [from], and is dedicated to, St. Paternus, who was descended from an ancient family in Armorica, from whence he sailed into Ireland, and living there some time incognito, went from thence into Wales; here his piety and conduct raised him such an interest that the princes of that country, then at variance, laid down their arms at his application. Camden in Cardiganshire tells us, that St. Patern resided there, and had a church there dedi cated to his memory, called Llan Badem Vaur, the church of St. Patern the Great. St. Patern hath likewise two churches here and in De von dedicated to him, this and North Pederwyn ; and hav ing done great service to religion in Wales, he returned into his native country of Armorica, at the instance of his countrymen, where he was received with great respect by Sampson the younger, Archbishop of Dole. The French Bretons keep three holidays in honour of his memory, one upon the day he procured peace among the Welsh princes, the second upon his going into orders, and the third upon the anniversary of his death, which happened about the year 540, and is, I suppose, the day on which the church celebrates his memory, viz. Nov. the 12th. In anno 1291,20th Edward I. (Tax.

There is but little to add respecting this parish, which is one of the very few livings held by the University of Ox ford, only five in all, with one lectureship. The church is spacious, and contains several monuments. It stands with a lofty tower on an elevated station and, being quite surrounded by trees, the whole is conspicuous and beautiful."], [351, "337 SOUTH PETHERWIN OR PEDERWIN. There are some annual fairs kept in the church town ; and the parish has three other villages, Trecroogo, Tre gallen, and Trethevy. Several of the farms were in former times the property and the residences of small gentlemen. The principal places are, Trebersey, where resided the family of Gedy, of whom Richard Gedy was Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1623, tlie 21st of King James the First. His daughter and heiress became the wife of Sir John Eliot the celebrated patriot, and in their descendants the property remained till the decease of Mr. John Eliot, about thirty years ago. This gentleman, who was Sheriff in 1776, devised his property to Mr. William Eliot, of Port Eliot, his distant relation. Mr. Eliot took down the old house, and built a large and handsome mansion at some little distance from the former ; but, succeeding to Port Eliot and the family property, on the death of his elder brother, he disposed of Trebersey to David Howell, Esq. who has made it his residence. The Editor has grounds for believing that his father, the Rev. Edward Giddy, was a descendant in the fourth degree, from a nephew of Mr. Richard Gedy of Trebersey, who settled in the West of Cornwall. Tresmarrow, a seat of the Pipers, previously to their occu- pying Madford, adjoining to Launceston, came with the heiress of that family, to ayounger son of Sir Richard Vyvyan of Trelowarren; theirson, Mr. Philip Vyvyan, having married Mary, the daughter of Sheldon Walter, Esq. acquired Tre- meal in the same parish, where he resided. Mr. Vyvyan left two sons and a daughter : Vvol, the eldest, succeeded to the family property, on the decease of his father's first cousin, the Rev. Sir Carew Vyvyan. The second son married, but died without a family. The daughter, Harriot, married Stephen Luke, Esq. M.D. ; and on the sale and division of Mr. Philip Vyvyan's landed property*, Dr. Luke acquired Tresmarrow, which is now become a farm house. Tremeal has been noticed above. Mr. Philip Vyvyan VOL.

After his decease, it was sold to Mr. Archer, brother to Mr. Archer of Trelaske, who resided here for some time; but, expe riencing one of the most severe afflictions to which human nature is exposed, by losing the dearest of all friends, he reduced the house to a fit dwelling for one who should occupy the farm, and ab.andoned a place deprived of all its attractions and of all its charms.

This parish is entirely situated on rocks of the calcareous series, consisting of a blue argillaceous slate, more or less fissile, of lamillar calcareous schist, and black limestone ; so that its geological composition is in all respects similar to what is found in the adjoining parishes of Launceston, Lawhitton, and Lezant."], [353, "339 PHILLACK. HALS. The manuscript relating to this parish is lost. TONKIN AND WHITAKER. Phillack is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath to the west Haile and St. Ives Bay, to the north Gwythian, to the east Gwyniar, to the south St. Earth. This parish takes its name from a female Saint, to whom the church is dedicated, Sancta Felicitas, by corruption Phil lack. [Query, who or whence was she ? I apprehend the Saint to be the same with that of Philly or Philleigh in the next article.] It is a rectory, valued in the King's Book at \u00a345. 10s. 8d. The patronage in the heirs of Sir John Arundell of Lan herne. The incumbent Mr. Edward Collins, who suc ceeded Mr. Jasper Philips. In anno 1291, 20 Edward I. this church was valued at (Tax. Benef.) \u00a36. 8s. 4c?. having never been appropriated. THE EDITOR. The church is neat but small, and very inadequate to the increased number of inhabitants in the parish : the tower, like most others in this part of Cornwall, is of granite. Phillack stands near the eastern branch of Hayle River, and towards the sea, from whence comminuted shell sand is con tinually brought inland by the wind, threatening to over whelm the whole village. Notice has been taken under Lelant of this ordinary incroachment of the sand, and of the inundations which have occurred at different periods remote from each other. Very considerable parts of Phil lack, and of Gwithian the adjoining parish, are covered with sand formed into hillocks of twenty or thirty feet high, z 2"], [354, "340 PHILLACK. representing in miniature one of the most uneven districts that can any where be found. Under these are frequently discovered fences, inclosures, and the walls of houses ; and the high valuation of the living in Wolsey's Survey seems to prove that much land must have been covered with sand since that time, and converted into what is named Towan. Notwithstanding this loss, however great it may have been, the parish has flourished in recent times, far beyond all former example or expectation, by the extension of trade, and by the consequent improvement of the harbour. The progress in both has been greatly accelerated by the successful working of various mines in the immediate neigh bourhood ; but the first step was taken when a copper smelting establishment was made there, soon after the middle of the last century. An opinion, or rather a feeling, had prevailed in Cornwall that the copper ores should be smelted at home, and not sent to the opposite coast of Wales. Nothing could be more erroneous. About three times the quantity of coal is required to smelt any given weight of the copper ore ; and the importation of coal from Swansea being very large, the conveyance of copper ore there produced alternate cargos. The whole scheme seems to have originated in mistaken analogies drawn from ordinary operations. A plan so injudicious and adopted without estimate or consideration must have failed, and would have done so at once, but for the counteracting power of individual ability, in the person of Mr. John Edwards ; a young man of Lud yan, who had been recommended at a very early age, to some situation requiring talent, by our celebrated historian Doctor William Borlase. Mr. Edwards speedily acquired the entire management and direction of the whole concern, which soon extended itself to the importation of coal, tim ber, limestone, iron, &c. for the supply of the neighbourhood ; and by the unwearied exertion of his superior genius, the business continued with success up to the period of his decease in Jan. 1807."], [355, "341 PHILLACK. Mr. Edwards may be reckoned among the distinguished persons whom Cornwall has produced, equal in number at the least, as we flatter ourselves, with those of any similar district. He acquired extensive general knowledge, and obtained an ascendancy over most persons on all occa sions. Mr. Edwards had a numerous family, but only two have married : his eldest daughter to Mr. John Tippett ; and their son has succeeded to the large property of Mr. Vivian of Pencalenick, and taken the name. His youngest son, Mr. Joseph Edwards, married Miss Devonshire of Truro, where he practised the Law with great credit and success. The company directed by Mr. Edwards experienced the rivalship in trade of a very able and enterprising individual Mr. John Harvey, and after his decease, still more power fully of his son. Each party in this legitimate and bene ficial contest endeavoured to improve their respective por tions of the harbour, and by so doing acted favourably on the whole. Mr. Edwards led the way by extending a mound across the eastern arm, and keeping back the high water at flood tide, which being suffered to escape through gates some hours afterwards, swept the sand before it, and deepened the channel. Mr. Harvey on his part constructed quays and wharfs, and recently a sluice, so that the inte rior of the harbour may be considered as improved to the utmost extent ; but works are still wanting to confine the current of water beyond the entrance, and thus to force a channel through the bar, produced here as in all other debouches of rivers, by the deposit of silt, of sand, or of mud, where the currents meet and occasion comparatively still water. A work most beneficial to the whole country was com pleted at Hayle in the year 1825, under the authority of an Act of Parliament. The passage across the main estuary was frequently dangerous and always interrupted by the tide ; several of the branches could not be passed at high water, and lives were not unfrequently lost. A causeway"], [356, "342 PHILLACK. provided with arches and parapets, now affords a safe line of communication from Penzance and the Western Peninsula, to the eastward ; and all the roads are raised above the utmost range of the tide. Mr. Lysons notices two castles said to have formerly stood in this parish, one still called Castle Cayle; but ii seems to be very doubtful whether any castellated house was ever built there, or even a military work, as the word castle appears to have been frequently applied in ridicule, and there are not extant any accounts relating to this place. The other, situated at the entrance of the river, a much more probable situation, and called Riviere or Theodore's Castle. The walls, if any ever existed, are taken down, and all traces of a foundation are hidden by the sand. Mr. Whitaker, who captivates every reader by the bril liancy of his style, and astonishes by the extent of his mul tifarious reading, draws, however, without reserve on his fertile imagination for whatever facts may be requisite to construct the fabric of a theory. He has made Riviere the palace and residence of Theodore, a sovereign Prince of Cornwall, and conducts St. Breca, St. Iva, with several companions, not only into Hayle and to this palace, after their voyage from Ireland, but fixes the time of their arrival so exactly as to make it take place in the night. In recent times the name of Riviere, which had been lost in the com mon pronunciation, Rovier, has revived in a very excellent house built by Mr. Edwards on the farm, which he com pleted in 1791. The place of most importance in Phillack was Trevassack, for many years the residence of the Yorkes, a considerable familv from .Somersetshire. Richard Yorke, of Wellington, married a daughter of Andrew Luttrell, of Dunster Castle ; and his grandson, Humphry Yorke, settled at Trevassack ; married Barbara, daughter of John Vyvyan, of Trelowarren ; and their granddaughter, Sarah Yorke, was the mother of Attorney general Noye. Some traces of its former splendour may"], [357, "343 PHILLACK. still be discovered. Erasmus Pascoe, who served the office of Sheriff in 1720, resided at this place; it now belongs to the partnership carrying on copper smelting and trade at Hoyle. In much more modern times a good house has been built on Bodrigy, which belonged to a branch of the Pendar veses, then to Williams, and was sold by three sisters, co heiresses of that family, to Mr. John Curnow, who acquired a large fortune by carrying on the trade of Hoyle for more than half a century, before modern energies altered and extended the scale of every mercantile transaction. Mr. Curnow also purchased Penpoll, and resided there. His property became ultimately divided between three daughters, one of whom married Mr. Robert Oke Millett, who succeeded Mr. Curnow at Penpoll, and has made it a handsome place. It now belongs to his son, the Rev. John Curnow Millett. Another daughter married the Rev. Wil liam Hocken, the late Rector of the parish : and the third married Mr. Parmenter from Ilfracombe. Mr. Curnow was of the family mentioned under Lugvan. Treglisson is a large farm, having on it a good house inhabited for many years by the family of Nichols, proprietors of the freehold. Phillack, in addition to the copper works at Hoyle, pos sesses also a tin smelting house at a village called indiffer ently Angarrack or Vellarvrane. It is said to be the first smelting house established by Becher and the other Ger mans for smelting tin ores in reverberatory furnaces by means of coal. During the life of Mr. William Tremaine the late managing partner, this place was decorated with the finest garden in the West of Cornwall. The advowson of this Rectory was in the Arundell family, but held for a considerable time on a lease for lives, by the Collinses of Treworgan in St. Erme : but on the death of Mr. Edward Collins in Jan. 1734, the lease having expired, and the presentation having reverted to Lord Arun dell, a Catholic, the exercise of the right for that turn lapsed"], [358, "344 PHILLACK. to the University of Oxford ; and the living was given oy convocation to the Rev. William Glover from Worcester shire, originally a member of Balliol College, and afterwards one of the Chaplains of All Souls. He married a daughter of the preceding Rector, and resided at Phillack all the remainder of his life. To guard against a similar lapse, a new lease for lives was granted by Lord Arundell to Mr. Hockin of Gwithian, whose son succeeded to Mr. Glover; and on the general sale of the Arundell property, this gentleman had the opportunity of purchasing the freehold, and his son the Rev. William Hockin is now the Patron and Rector of Phillack. The parish feast is kept on the nearest Sunday to the 23d of November, being the day consecrated to St. Clement, Pope and Martyr.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. The rocks of this parish, like those of Gwinear adjoining, belong to the prophyritic series; the northern part is covered with hillocks of sand, a considerable portion of which, as on some part of Gwithian, has been drifted from place to place by the action of the wind ; this to a certain extent is now prevented by a covering of arenaceous plants, the extensive fibrous roots of which form a loose spongy net work, which serves to retain the sand in its place. This sand was originally of marine origin, being at low levels entirely composed of fragments of marine shells ; but inland, on more elevated places, a considerable portion of terres-"], [359, "345 PILLATON. trial shell enters into its composition : these have been derived from the myriads of the snail tribe, which browse on the scanty herbage of these dreary Towans. The inland drifts, after a strong wind, will be found to consist almost entirely of the fragments of those land shells. On the coast this testaceous sand is in several places consolidated into calcareous sandstone ; but this has taken place on a more extended scale in the parish of Crantock. THE EDITOR.

THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons gives a short history of the principal or only manors in this parish. The manors of Pillaton and Har denfast were at an early period in a family bearing the singular name of Inkpen ; then they belonged to Doro thy Dillington, heiress of John Charles, esq. who sold them to Thomas Moone. From this gentleman, Mr. Lysons says the manors passed to the family of Coryton, although he does not state in what way. They were ultimately devised by Sir John Coryton, who died in 1739, to his widow, and by her to the family of Helyar. Pentillie Castle is in this parish, one of the most splendid seats in the whole county, as well in regard to the magnifi cence of the castellated house constructed by the present proprietor, John Tillie Coryton, esq. on the site of a former house called Pentillie Castle, as to the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and to the romantic hill and dale of the grounds. This place was the seat of Sir James Tillie, who left the property to his sister's son, Mr. James Woolley, who took the name of Tillie, and his granddaughter brought the estate to the late John Coryton, esq. Sheriff of Cornwall in 1782, as his son has been in 1808. The church and tower are not distinguished from others in the neighbourhood, except by a south transverse aisle belonging to Pentillie, and containing monuments to diffe rent members of the family. In the body of the church is an inscription commemorating the Rev. Ralph Eliot, who died in 1625, having been Rector of the parish during fifty years.

THE EDITOR. This parish, although it is small and situated in a remote part of the county, possesses several ancient family seats, and a well-built church, with various monuments, placed in a valley full of trees, and opening immediately to the sea. The manor, including the whole parish, originally with out doubt in possession of the lands, although it is now become, like innumerable other manors, a mere royalty, was given by Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, to the Abbey"], [364, "350 POUGHILL. of Clyve in Somersetshire. It is an instance, however, of the small reliance that can be placed on the orthography of ancient names, since the charter of Hubert de Burgo is in these words : \" Sciant pr\u00e6sentes et futuri, quod ego Hubertus de Burgo Domini Regis Camerarius, dedi, concessi, et hac pr\u00e6senti carta. mea confirmavi, Deo et Beat\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 et monachis de Cliva, ibidem Deo servientibus et servituris, pro salute anim\u00e6 me\u00e6, et patris et matris me\u00e6, et omnium antecessorum et parentum et her\u00e6dum meorum, in per petuam elemosinam, totum dominicum quod habui in Rugeham,\" which must be Poughill.

Mr. Lysons, who, from his situation in the Tower, pos sessed the most ample means of ascertaining all transactions with the Crown, states that King James the First sold this manor to two gentlemen, Mr. George Salter and Mr. John Williams ; in more recent times it belonged to the family of Stanbury, and is now the property of Thomas Troad, esq.

Scawen, gent, sold this barton in the early part of the 17th century, to John Williams of Carvean, esq. only brother to William Williams of Trewithgy, esq. Mr. Williams built a large brick house here, but died very soon after that he got into it, leaving three daughters by his wife, the only daughter and heir of John Courtenay of Tregelles, gent, who died a few days before him in child bed ; for grief of which, it is said, he broke his heart : he lett three daughters, Mary, Ann, and Catherine, all very young, and up to this time all unmarried (about 1730). But that his estate might not be divided, he gave it solelv to his eldest daughter Mary, who now possesses it, with a considerable estate of the duchy adjoining. The arms are the same with Williams of Trevorva. Not far from Trehane is Carvean, or the Little Town, which was the seat in lease (it belonging to the manor of Gowlden) to the above mentioned John Williams, esq. on whose death it fell into the lord's hand, who granted a new lease of it to William Hobbs, gent. Joining with Carvean, there being nothing between them but a road, is Trewother, which was for several generations the seat in lease of the family of Huddy, the freehold being in the Trevanions of Carhays. I next come to the manor of Trelowthes, which I take to be the same which is called by Mr. Carew Trelowith, which means the town place of trees. Next is the manor of Trewithgy, alias Trenowith, alias Treworgy ; but as I take the first to be the right name, I give its interpretation, which doth signify a town of trees by the river.

This barton, which is of a very good yearly value, was once the dwelling of a family bearing the same name ; the last of which family had an only daughter and heir, who married Williams of Herringstone in the county of Dorset, which match was the first settling of that family in Cornwall. The arms of Williams are, Argent, a greyhound current between three Cornish choughs Proper, within a plain bor der Gules, charged with six crosses formee Or and as many Bezants.

The other sister, Catherine, married Nicholas Carminow, esq. of Trenouth in this pa rish. On the decease of his father-in-law, which happened in the year 1514, Mr. Tregian settled himself here, and lived in great splendour. Leland mentions the hou**-^ as building, and Carew says, Walvedon, alias Golden, fell into Tregion, by match with the inheritrix thereof. Their son married an Arundell of Lanherne. Their grandson with the Lord Stourton's daughter. The arms of Tregion are Ermine, on a chief Sable, three birds Or, beaked and legged Argent. But Mr. Carew, though it happened in his time, does not mention the great misfortune which befel their grand child, Francis Tregian, esq. though it was not long before (twenty-five years) and ended in the total ruin of this wealthy and flourishing family ; in giving an account of which I will be as brief as the thing will bear. Mr. Cam den has touched on it in his Annals of Queen Elizabeth, (A.

I have heard several intelligent people say, that the estate of this family in this county alone, was worth at the least \u00a33000 per annum, besides a large sum they were possessed of in ready money, which enabled them to build such a noble house here, of which the remains are still magnificent ; and among these, under an old tower, they still show the place where Cuthbert Mayne the priest was found concealed. Norden says, that Mr. Tregion remained in prison full twenty years, but that he was released by an order of Queen Elizabeth herself about 1597, and that he after wards lived near London, supported, as was believed, by the bounty of his friends. Francis Tregion the son, having repossessed himself by purchase and by favour of some part of the property taken from his father, found that he could not stem the tide raised against him by persons envious of his returning prosperity, or eager to obtain the plunder of his possessions, as had been done by his father ; for in January 1608, this persecuted family suffered in his person a further and second loss of their estates, in some degree owing perhaps to the strong feelings of apprehension"], [375, "361 PROBUS. and of resentment occasioned by the Gunpowder Plot of November the 5th, three years before. Mr. Tregion, resolving to do the best that he could, received some money by compounding with various parties to confirm their titles, and thus embarked for Spain, where, as it is said, he was very well received on account of his own and his father's sufferings for religion, and that he was made a grandee of that Kingdom ; and that his poste rity still flourish there with the title of Marquis of St. Angelo. Whether this be true or not I cannot affirm, having it only by tradition ; however, we hear no more of him in this country. The next that we find in possession of this barton, and living there, was Ezekiel Grose : he died here, and left it to his only daughter and heir, married to Buller, esq. of Shillingham, with a great estate in other parishes, in whose posterity it continued till the year 1710, when James Buller, esq. the last of that branch, dying without issue, gave the whole by will to his great-uncle, who had acquired Morval through a marriage with the heiress of Coode. Talbot, which is an abbreviation of Haleboat, says Nor den, p. 61, is a rock called Ha-le- boate rock, wherein to this day are seen many great iron rings, whereunto boats have been tied, although there is now no show of an haven, but only a little brook running through the valley into a branch of the River Fall. To the north-east of Gowlden lies Tredenham, a small manor which the late Sir Joseph Tredenham believed to be Denhamstown, and derived himself from a younger branch of the family which formerly resided there, which he also testified by his arms, Argent, a bend lozengy Gules, by way of distinction, as was usual in former times, from the parent stock, which gave Gules, three lozenges in sess Ermine. But however that may be, this was the seat of the Tredenhams for many generations, till they removed, first to Kellion in Cornelly, and then to Tregonnan in St. Ewe."], [376, "362 PROBUS. This small manor, from which some estates are held, par ticularly Corvith in St. Cuby, was sold with the greater part of the Tredenham property in 1727, to Doctor John Hawkins of Pennance, who is the present lord of it. CURVOZA. That is the walled or fortified town, so called from an intrenchment, for voza properly signifies a trench or place cast up. This trench was measured for me by Mr. Joseph Webber, steward to Miss Mary Williams of Trehane, tlie proprietor ; and it proved to be two hundred and ten paces in circumference. [Car or Cair is a fort, and voza and voran are the plural of voz or vore, a ditch (see Pryce's Vocabulary). Corvoza would therefore be the entrenched fort. Ed.] THE EDITOR. The church at Probus is large, but not remarkable for any thing beyond other churches in the neighbourhood, In it are some monuments, and especially one to Mr. Tho mas Hawkins of Trewithon, sometime member for Gram pound, who died in 1766. This gentleman not having passed the small-pox, and resolving on being inoculated, thought it was his duty to extend the same benefit to all his neighbours in the parish. Several scores had in consequence this dreadful disease communicated to them in its mitigated form, and all recovered except the benevolent individual himself, who thus extensively introduced inoculation, at that time a novelty in Cornwall among the great mass of the people. He is supposed to have carried too far the asthenic system for counteracting fever, and perhaps to have taken the contagion, in what is termed the natural way, previously to the artificial communication. Although the church is not superior to others around it, the tower is on the whole more magnificent than any other"], [377, "363 PROBUS. in the county. The tower at Week St. Mary, near Strat ton, is said to be somewhat more lofty ; and several exceed that at Probus in elegance and lightness of proportions, but this combines massiveness, altitude, and elaborate deco ration ; moreover, it has been built since the Reformation, and according to tradition, by the voluntary contributions of the unmarried inhabitants of the parish ; but the same is said of a lofty tower at Derby ; and of the windows of St. Neot's Church, one is given by the unmarried men, and another by the single women of that parish. It is quite clear that this church was collegiate, having a dean and a certain number of prebendaries, founded in very early times before the Norman Conquest, and probably by St. Edward. The Deanery became attached with its share of the endowments to the Church of Exeter, but in a way which Mr. Whitaker himself has not succeeded in clearly making out. The prebendaries or some of them remained till the general dissolution, when the prebends were given or sold, and have passed through the Williams's, by purchase to the Hawkins family, with some fairs. One fair, however, is the grant of King Charles the Second. Few gentlemen's houses in the west of Cornwall were without the honour of receiving Prince Charles during his residence in Cornwall, about the middle part of the civil wars ; and he is said to have remained for a time longer than usual with Mr. Williams, who, after the Restoration, waited on the King with congratulations from the parish ; and on being complimented by him with the question whether he could do any thing for his friends, answered that the parish would esteem themselves highly honoured and distinguished by the grant of a fair, which was accord ingly done for the 17th of September ; this fair coming the last in succession after three others, has acquired for itself a curious appellation derived from the two patron saints, and from the peculiar pronunciation in that neighbourhood of the word last, somewhat like laest : \u2014"], [378, "364 PROBUS. Saint Probus and Grace, Not the first but the last, \u2014 and from this distinction it is usually called Probus and Grace fair. It is utterly impossible now to give any account of these two personages, except that they were in all probability missionaries from Ireland. Nor is the Roman name of Pro bus any objection against this supposition, since such names were frequently assumed. The apostle of Ireland has a Roman name, and many of the religious must have been foreigners. On repairing the east wall of the chancel some few years since, two skeletons were found in different niches, and one of these was declared by anatomists to have been a female. These were supposed to be the relics of St. Pro bus and of St. Grace, which may have been true, although the present church cannot be less than eight hundred or a thousand years later than their time. No obvious indication can be discovered of the ancient college ; perhaps the prebendaries ceased to reside after the deanery became absorbed at Exeter. Mr. Whitaker has left several pages of memoranda on this parish, evidently notes made at the time of his visit there, and not arranged in any order. The Editor thinks it therefore most expedient to adopt such parts only as seem to explain the etymologies, or to give information respecting facts. Mr. Whitaker observes, that, although the dedication of this parish is to St. Probus alone, yet assuredly St. Grace should be adopted also as a patron saint. The parish feast kept in the early part of July, is always designated by their joint names. No notice is taken of either in Bede. On Carvean, Mr. Whitaker says, that it means the Little Marsh, as cars is a bay, a marsh, or a moor, corsen a reed, cors-hwyad in Welsh, is a fen-duck, a moorhen."], [379, "365 PROBUS. On Trewithgy. \u2014 In English a house surrounded by trees, and lying in the water. Trewithgy, Trenowith, and Treworgy, are different parts of the same manor. Treno with signifies the New Town, and Treworgy a local name, remarkably common, as it is sure to be from its signification, being the town upon the water, or rather perhaps, upon the running stream. Mr. Whitaker says, the manor of Probus appears from Domesday Book to have been possessed by St. Edward the Confessor ; it was therefore one of the demesnes of the Crown at that time, and probably one of those belonging to the sovereigns of Cornwall previously to the conquest bv the Saxons. Then I presume that an English family set tled on those lands, and held them of the Crown ; probably the Walvedons, who held them with Gowlden. On this barton is an angular sort, says Borlase, p. 313 of his Antiquities, second edition, \" on the barton of Wolvedon, alias Golden, in the parish of Probus, which has a wide deep ditch, the entire edge or counterscarp of which was faced upwards with masonry of thin stones in cement, which had round turrets or buttresses (such as neither Saxons, Danes, nor Britons had, as far as ever I can find) of the same masonry, interspersed with the straight lines of the ditch. This is very singular in our county, where most of our ancient fortifications are of a circular plan, without any projections (angular or circular) from the master line. I can judge this, therefore, neither to be British, Saxon, nor Danish, as being like no other work of these people, and from the artful fence of this ditch, as well as from the polygon which the whole forms, I guess it to be a Roman work. There is a large avenue or way from the north, rising from an adjoining valley. This fortified ground I examined in August 1792. It is an earthwork denominated Warren, containing six Cornish acres, as the farmer told me, or about seven statute acres. It has a high and broad rampart twelve or fourteen feet high, and a deep ditch fourteen or sixteen feet wide. The"], [380, "366 PROBUS. whole forms a long square, the greatest length from east to west. It has two gateways on tlie north, and two on the south, one on the east, ai d one on the west, each answering to the other, and having a raised avenue across the ditch. I therefore conclude it to be a Roman camp, made at the period when that people subdued Cornwall, and calculated for the reception of a large detachment. The revetments mentioned by Dr. Borlase do not appear, nor the project ing turrets. About a mile t > the north of this, beyond a deep gully, may be found what is noticed by Mr. Tonkin as Caer Voza, and noticed by Doctor Borlase in his Natural History, p. 324, as Caerfos or Caerfosou. This is an estate, called so from a field close to the house, which has a strong and lofty rampart upon the north side, and a large deep ditch upon the north of that. These continue all along the northern side of the field, and have a slight return on the east and west towards the south ; but then they cease, nor can any traces be found of them afterwards. Perhaps this imperfect work may have been a camp of the Britons opposed to that of the Romans, or one commenced at least for that purpose. Thus far Mr. Whitaker. Trehane, with a considerable property around it, were given, as Mr. Tonkin has stated, by the last Mr. Williams of that place, to his eldest daughter Mary, who married the Rev. William Stackhouse, D.D. Rector of St. Erme, the adjoining parish. Doctor Stackhouse was from the county of Durham, a brother of the Rev.

His eldest son William, married one of the Miss Rash leighs of Menabilly, and settled at Trehane, where he lived universally esteemed and respected till June 1830, when he departed this life in his 90th year, leaving Trehane to his eldest son, who resides \u25a0 there at present. Mr. John Stackhouse, whose son Edward William Wynne Pendarves represents the county in Parliament, is noticed under Cambourne. TREWITHAN. This place ranks among the principal seats in Cornwall. It stands on a commanding situation, possesses extensive plantations, and looks over those to the south and east into vallies highly cultivated and rendered beautiful by wood and water, the two most pleasing ingredients in rural land scapes. The house was in part built by Mr. Courtenay Williams, who is said to have dissipated a handsome fortune by indulging himself in low pursuits and in low company, and especially by maintaining a set of people to accompany him from parish to parish, for (what seems quite ludicrous in present times) the purpose of ringing the bells; yet about the middle of the last century a new peal of bells was procured for Kenwyn Church, to accommodate the prin cipal inhabitants of Truro with that exercise and amuse ment. After the purchase of this place, together with the manor of Probus, the appropriated share of the great tithes, the lease under the Church of Exeter conveying the remainder part for lives, &c. Mr. Philip Hawkins made Trewithan his residence, and represented Grampound in three or four Par liaments in the Reign of George the Second ; but not having any family himself, nor his brothers, almost the whole of their landed properties were devised to their eldest sister Mary, who had married her distant relation, Mr. Christopher Hawkins of Helston, and of Trewinnard in St. Erth."], [382, "368 PROBUS. Their only son Mr. Thomas Hawkins, succeeded his uncle at Trewithan, and also represented Grampound : he mar- ried Ann, daughter of James Heywood, esq. of London ; but being unfortunately taken out of this life while he endeavoured to introduce the most important discovery ever made in medicine, for the benefit of others as well as of himself, he left five children minors, Philip, Christo- pher, Thomas, John, and a daughter. Philip and Thomas died in early life ; the estate, therefore, devolved on Chris- topher, who having never married, died in May 1829, and in consideration probably of the large fortune possessed by his brother, devised the whole of his real property to Henry Hawkins, his brother's younger son, then about eight years old, to whom it now belongs. But the affair which most peculiarly distinguishes this parish is the persecution of Mr. Tregion. It appears from Camden's Annales of Queen Elizabeth, inserted above, and from contemporary historians, that, although enactments were made (they must not be honoured with the name of laws) against Catholics, imposing penal- ties and disabilities, and prohibiting altogether the celebra- tion of their peculiar rites supposed to conciliate the Divine favour \u2014 yet if masses were performed without ostentation, and under a decent veil of secrecy, or if auricular confessions were made and absolutions received in private, little notice was taken of them, nor were priests eagerly sought after, who divested themselves in public of all peculiar and discriminating habits, and abstained from attempting proselytism. But when the Church of Rome thundered its excommunications against the Queen, when plots be- came more manifest at home, connected also with the indi- vidual nearest to the Crown, if the custom of hereditary suc- cession were preserved ; measures of great severity were adopted, on the ever doubtful plea of state necessity : so that more victims to religious opinions are said to have suffered death, banishment, or the loss of liberty, under"], [383, "369 PROBUS. this reign, than under that of Mary Tudor, whose very name we have all been taught to associate with an epithet denoting the utmost horror : but her persecutions were conducted without disguise, in the name of religion, and to make forced converts, while Elizabeth professed to act from motives of temporal policy ; moreover, the religion of one has been deprived of all its endowments, and been pro scribed for two centuries; that of the other, most happily for ourselves, has flourished through the whole period. It seems this Mr. Tregion and his connections were among the first sufferers under this cruel policy. His father married an Arundell, and himself a daughter of Lord Stourton, both families that have continued up to the pre sent times in the profession of the ancient faith. Mr. Tregion had moreover a very large estate, calculated to excite the zeal of a well-known and detested class of men, who from the time of the C\u00e6sars, and doubtlessly from a period long before, have used all means and all pretences, sacred or profane, to advance their own fortunes by the ruin of others. Mr. Tregion, it appears, was the first or among the first accused under the inflamed passions and the persecuting spirit of those times, and the sheriff came in person to search his house ; but the sheriff is stated to have been a personal friend, or at all events as a countryman and a neighbour, to have made a slight examination, and then to have dined, and unfortunately to have drank with the individual accused : when Subita incautum Dementia cepit, Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere Manes, which induced him, in the pride and confidence inspired by wine, to reproach his guest with the insufficiency of his search, and to conduct him to a part of the house or pre mises clearly indicative of his temporary imprudence and contempt. The sheriff, probably heated also by wine, imme diately renewed his examination, and finally discovered in a secret hole under a turret, a Catholic clergyman, called Cuthbert Mayne. vol. in. 2 B"], [384, "370 PROBUS. On this they were both arrested, and subsequently arraigned at the Assizes, and both convicted of those atrocious crimes : Mr. Mayne of being a Catholic Priest, and found in England; and Mr. Tregion of having received into his house a minister of that religion in which he had been bred, of the religion of his forefathers, of the religion of the father and forefathers of the highly talented Female who then mainly directed the affairs of the state, and of the undisputed and sole religion of the whole country about half a century before. And for these ideal offences, (one scruples to stain the paper with so foul a record ! ) was Mr. Mayne actually hanged, and Mr. Tregion, under the sen tence of a premunire, was deprived of his whole property, and suffered an imprisonment of twenty years. Whether we contemplate the cold-hearted tyranny of Henry the Seventh, the wild despotic sway of Henry the Eighth, the civil dissensions in the nominal reign of his son, the bigotry and unrelenting persecutions of Mary, or the cruelties, however necessary, exercised by Elizabeth, we may indeed rejoice that the great work of the Reformation bas been achieved, at any price, by the House of Tudor ; but we must join in the exclamation, Oh ! dearest God, sorefend Such times should e'er return Probus measures 7349 statute acres.

They appear to afford a most decided example of greywacke, exhibiting large grains, and even nodules of quartz on their fractured surfaces ; this however can only be seen on surfaces that have been for some time exposed to the weather ; for no such appearance can be observed when the fractures are recent and perfect. These locks are pro bably masses of compact felspar, in the bases of which silica so predominated at the time of their formation, as to have given rise to large concretions of quartz. Since Doctor Boase made the geological examination of Cornwall, an abridgment of which he has had the kindness and the liberality to communicate for this work, the road leading westward from Grampound, has been turned to the north, and thus obviated a steep and even dangerous hill, and in consequence the sections referred to can no longer be seen on die highway.

Mr. Lysons says that the ancient name of this parish was Cruetheke ; it is commonly pronounced Quithik. The greater part of this parish belongs to Mr. Coryton of Pentillie. Mr. Lysons gives a detail of the manors, but it is quite uninteresting. One called the manor of Trehunsey, probably gives a name to the principal village, Trehunest. The church has on the outside an appearance of very great antiquity verging on decay. Within, it contains several remnants of ancient times, and monuments with inscriptions to the memoiy of former parishioners. The great tithes were appropriated to a chantry at Hac comb, in the Deanery of Kenn, in Devonshire. Tanner says, in the church of St. Blase here was a college or large chantry of five priests, under the government of an arch presbyter in the reign of King Edward the Third. Dug dale's Monasticon, new edition, has the following history of this place. Mr. Oliver, iri his Historic Collections, has printed the foundation deed of this college, premising that the public notary has omitted to affix the date to it in Bishop Gran dison's Register : but that by comparing it with the institu tion of the first archpriest, Andrew de Tregors, in sol. 46 of the 3d vol. of the same register, he was of opinion that it must have been drawn up, either late in the year 1341, or in the early part of 1342. This foundation deed states that Sir Stephen de Hac combe had formerly applied to Bishop Grandison to erect the parish church of St. Blase at Haccombe, the burial"], [387, "373 aUETHIOCK. place of his ancestors, into an archpresbytery ; that before the prelate could comply with his wishes, the knight died, but that his heir Sir John L'Ercedekne had entered into his views, and renewed the application to the Bishop, who had acceded to the request, and consented to the appro priation of the parish church of St. Hugh de Quedyock in Cornw-all, for the better support of the archpriest and his community. The community, besides the archpriest, con sisted of five clergymen, who were called Socii, who were bound to sing the canonical office, and to celebrate obits ; they dwelt under the same roof with the archpriest, and lived in common. The archpriest was obliged to pay six marks per annum to the Treasury of the Cathedral of Exeter. Mr. Lysons says, in his Devonshire, p. 250, that the arch priest or rector, as he is now called, continues to exist as the sole representative of this college, enjoying its revenues: but certainly not the great tithes of Quethiock, since they belong to Sir Henry Carew of Haccomb, derived through the Courtenays. The vicarage is in the gift of the Bishop. It is stated in Dr. Borlase's Collections, that there was formerly a chapel in this parish, or tower, dedicated to St. Mary.

Rame is in the hundred of East, and is surrounded to the west, south, and part of the east by the sea, to the rest of the east by Maker, and to the north by St. John's.

I take this Johanna de Rame to be the person that was married to Stephen Durnford, esq. who was Sheriff of Cornwall, 7 Henry V. whose only daughter and heir Jane brought this lordship, with a large inheritance, to her hus band Sir Pierce Edgcombe of Cuttvyle, and in their pos terity it still remaineth, the honorable Richard Edgcombe, esq. being the present lord of this manor, and in right thereof, patron of this parish, as was said before. The arms of Rame were, in allusion to the name, Azure, a scalp of a ram's head Argent, armed ; and Durnford's Azure, an eagle displayed Or. But the barton of Rame hath since often changed its owners.."], [389, "375 RAME THE EDITOR. Rame church is situated in a very peculiar manner, far out on the point of land, and immediately near a rocky cliff. It has several monuments to former rectors and others, but none of general interest. The manor of Rame, and the advowson of the living, continue in the Edgcumbe family ; but the barton has for some generations belonged to the Edwardses, and, under the name of Rame Place, is still their residence. The remarkable feature of this parish is Rame Head, or as it is usually called, the Ram ; and it is a general belief that the name is really taken from the resemblance of the point to the Roman battering ram ; as the Lizard is supposed to be so called, from the long flat serpentine formation resembling the body of a saurian animal : but it seems to be much more probable that these observed resemblances should have corrupted some former names accidentally agreeing with them in sound, than that the promontories should be really distinguished by appellations so very modern. Near the extremity of the point are the ruins of a chapel still very visible, dedicated to St. Michael, as all chapels similarly situated were dedicated by our ancestors, from the habits of a winged angel being assimilated to those of birds. The Ram Head itself exhibits the appearance of a grand mass of rocks gradually tapering into the sea, much resem bling Cudden Point in the Mount's Bay. It forms the. exterior boundary of Plymouth Harbour to the westward, as Penlee Point does of what is technically called the Sound.

Lat. 50\u00b0 10' 55\", Ion. 4\u00b0 15' 3.\" In time 17m. west of Greenwich. The Eddystone rocks had been for ages the dread of mariners ; they lie nearly in the direction of the line joining the Lizard and the Start, and directly in the way of ships making Plymouth harbour from the westward ; their extent is moreover considerable, reaching in one direction to about a mile, with only a small rock appearing above the water. The desire of a lighthouse was therefore strongly felt, and at last, in the year 1696, Mr. Winstanley, of Little bury in Essex, undertook this arduous work, and completed it in about four years; but Mr. Winstanley made his wooden fabric of a large size, and of great height, trusting to the tenacity of chains and iron rods for its support ; not h.aving learnt from experience that those materials are inca pable of resisting, for any considerable] time, the repeated percussions of a tempestuous sea. Mr. Winstanley himself happened to be there on the 26th of November, 1703, when the storm took place, which is believed not to have been equalled since that time. On the following day every thing had disappeared, with the excep tion of two iron rods which were fastened in the rock, and not a trace of the building was ever discovered. Three years afterward, in the year 1706, Mr. John Rudyard undertook to erect another light-house, undis mayed by the terrible catastrophe of the former ; and this gentleman adopted the correct principle of opposing the impact of waves by the force of gravity, a power equally constant, certain and stable, as that by which it is opposed. He therefore constructed a plain framework of wood, nearly cylindrical, with cross beams, and filled the whole with large blocks of granite, leaving no more room than was requisite for the lights, for the attendants, and for their stores ; and he made so rapid a progress as to display the light on the 28th of July 1708, and completely to finish the whole in"], [391, "377 RAME the year following : notwithstanding that a French priva teer took off some workmen and their tools in the progress of the work. But Louis the XIV. displayed on this occa sion the real spirit of generosity and honour, of which he had endeavoured to support a weak resemblance through out his long reign. He ordered the workmen and their effects to be restored, and committed to prison the persons concerned in this unprincipled act publicly ; declaring that, although he was at war with England, he was at peace with the human race, for whose common benefit such works was constructed. In Mr. Rudyard's lighthouse the wooden frame was evi dently an imperfection. It must be liable to decay, and might become the prey of flames. To obviate in some degree the former defect, contrivances were adopted for shifting the beams; but on the 2d of December 1755, after the work had stood forty-seven years, the wood-work actually caught fire and wasentirelyconsumed. Boats were dispatched from ships as well as from the shore, when the flames became visible, which brought away the three men, who had used their utmost endeavours, but in vain, to extinguish the fire. For tunately at that hour the tide was at its ebb, which allowed the men to retreat sufficiently at a distance from the heat to preserve their lives; two had received very little injury, nor was the other apparently much hurt, but standing near the foot of the building in front, and looking intently at the flames as they issued through the top, he gave way to an innate propensity, which anatomists have endeavoured to explain by two tubes leading from near the palate to the ear, by keeping his mouth wide open ; when some melting lead descended and passed down his throat, which would otherwise have glanced from his skin without occa sioning the least injury. This man, although he had advanced so far in life as to his ninety-fourth year, lived several days, and without suffering much pain. After his decease, a mass of lead weighing seven ounces, five drams, and eighteen grains, little less than half a pound, was taken"], [392, "378 RAME from his stomach. See a communication by Mr. Edward Spry, Surgeon of Plymouth, in the Philosophical Transac tion, vol. XLIX. p. 459, and vol. X. p. 673, of the Abridg ment. Notwithstanding this second disaster, the lessees under the Trinity House were still resolved if possible to discharge their duty. They applied in consequence to Lord Mac clesfield, then President of the Royal Society, who recom mended the most eminent of our civil engineers, with whom no one can be thought to compare, excepting perhaps the late Mr. John Rennie. Mr. Smeaton was in consequence of Lord Macclesfield's recommendation applied to by the proprietors, and most fortunately for mankind he undertook the work. Mr. Smeaton adopted the essential principle of his pre decessor Mr. Rudyard, by opposing weight to the force of the waves : but he made improvements in many respects, by contriving a better figure, by more completely uniting the work into one mass, and by discarding wood altogether. The construction and the dimensions of every part are given by Mr. Smeaton in an elaborate work with plates ; and it may be a sufficient recommendation to say, that the greatest work of this kind executed since his time, and by a most able engineer, that on the Bell Rock near the Forth, is almost an exact copy of the Eddystone. Mr. Bond, who visited the Eddystone on the 4th of August, 1788, has given the following description of it in his History of Looe, published in 1823. \" Immediately opposite Looe church, fourteen miles off and visible from the parade and hills, is the Eddystone lighthouse, built by the late Mr. Smeaton of Yorkshire. The lantern is an octagon of about nine feet diameter. Till within a few years last past, it used to be lighted with twenty-four very large candles, sixteen in one round frame, and eight in another. Now Argand lamps are used, with highly polished reflectors. The candle light was not frequently seen from Looe by the naked eye : now the light is very strong, and in dark nights does not appear above a league distant."], [393, "RAME 379 \" At highwater the sea nearly embraces the base of the building.

THE MANOR OF REDRUTH, properly so called, which comprehends the town of the same name, and part of the parish, but not entire, and intermixed with several other gentlemen's lands. This manor is now divided between three lords, the Right Hon. Henry Earl of Radnor, John Hawkins, D. D. (by purchase lately from Francis Scobell, esq. as heir of Tredenham), and Reginald Haweis of Kelliow, esq. THE TOWN OF REDRUTH. This was formerly so inconsiderable as to be wholly past in Mr. Carew's Survey; who indeed is so much in haste in the whole hundred of Penwith, that he seems to be like a weary traveller, glad to come to his journey's end. But this town is of late years grown very considerable, and its market the greatest in the West, especially for corn. It owes its rise to the great confluence of people drawn toge ther by the mines of tin and copper, with which it is sur rounded; yet it must have been in former days of some note, since in the reign of Edward the Third, William Basset of Tyhiddy, got a patent from that king, to keep \" duo mercata\" weekly, \" et duas ferias annuatim\" here. But whether it did not turn to account, or however it was, the market was neglected, and only the two fairs kept, which still continue in that family. John Buller, of Morval, esq. being trustee for Francis Basset, esq. and finding such an old patent lying neglected among Mr. Basset's papers, (as I have heard the late Mr. Basset often say,) took out a new patent from Oliver Crom well (which he got afterwards confirmed by King Charles the Second), for one market weekly on Friday, and ano ther additional fair on . And the better to colour the matter, [he] took it in the name of his nephew Francis Buller of Shillingham, esq. grandson to the above mentioned John Buller, in whom the whole estate is cen tred. Thr town of Redruth consists chiefly of one large street,"], [396, "382 REDRUTH. near half a mile in length, and in it are several fair build ings, the principal inhabitants being Mr. John Cock, Mr. Anthony Cock, Mr. Paul Michell, Mr. Richard Banbury, &c. many of which live upon their own land. At the bot tom of the great street, near the river, was the chapel, where service was performed twice a week within the memory of some living ; but now it is unroofed, and the bell carried to Trefusis, it lying in Mr. Trefusis's land. The family of Trengove, alias Nance, have several houses and lands in and about this town, which being annexed to their manor of Penwinnick and Melgisy, are now enjoyed by Chester Nance, esq. ; as had likewise the family of Pen darves, which were sold by Sir William Pendarves, not long before his death, to Samuel Harris, gent, of the family of Park in St. Clement's, whose son Harris now enjoys them. So had too the family of Haweis, who are very antient in the parish ; and I have been told that Mr. Haweis of Kelliow is descended from a younger son of this family, but the eldest by a second marriage, to whom came a third of the manor, and several good estates adjacent. Their dwelling-house here, now turned to several tene ments, was sold about thirty years since to Mr. Richard Remfry, by David Haweis, gent, father to the present ; and his grandson, Mr. John Hussey, now enjoys it. John Collins of Treworgan, esq. hath likewise an estate here, and was born in this town. The estate came by his mother. Adjoining to the south of the town is THE MANOR OF TRERUFF. Abundance of good tin and copper hath been lately dug out of this manor, chiefly out of a mine called Pedenandre; the present lord of which is Robert Trefusis, esq. Next is the Manor of Tollgus, which I take to si-* nify the hole in the wood, though there [be] but little [of wood] there at present. [Toll-gus, like Tol-verne and Bar gus before, is Tol (C) and Kuz (C), the high wood. W.]"], [397, "383 REDRUTH.

Next is Tollgus [itself], which gives name to the manor, and was lately the seat of Richard Remfry, gent, an emi nent attorney; who having buried his two sons (the eldest of which, Henry Remfry, esq. was a barrister at law), left this to his grandson, by his eldest daughter, John Hus sey, gent, who now enjoys it. This manor was anciently Tregian's, and came as you may see in Golden to Grosse, and is now vested in John Francis Buller, esq. THE MANOR OF TRELEIGH. Id est, the dwelling place, lies adjoining to Tollgus, the river only parting them. The barton hereof hath been for three generations the seat of that most ancient family of Pollard, being the chief stock from whence all the others of that name were descended, which is now extinct by the death of the late John Pollard, esq. who died at his lodg ings in London, Oct. 25, 1731, leaving only one daughter Margaret, yet unmarried, having buried a few years before two very hopeful sons, Hugh and John, both grown to men. Yet I cannot leave this place without paying a due re spect to the memory of my deceased friend, and saying that for quick natural parts, integrity, and true endeavours to serve to the utmost of his power those whom he pretended friendship to, he hath but few surviving equals. Some time before his death he purchased the manor (which is but a small thing) from Richard Erisey, esq. whose family had been [latterly the lords] of it, and their memory is still pre served in a tenement in it called Park Erisey. This barton hath produced of late years vast quantities of tin and copper, though but little to the advantage of its owner, who had the misfortune to have his good nature too much abused by a parcel of villains he intrusted to his ruin."], [398, "384 REDRUTH. To the south of Treleigh, are a long row of houses belong ing to the barton, on a level piece of ground called Plain an Guary [a level for sports], from a round in the middle of it for a public playing place. The church lieth near a quarter of a mile out of the town, at the very western extremity of the parish, with a profitable glebe round it. In anno 1291, 20 Edw. I. (Tax. Ben.) it was valued at 50s. having never been appropriated. THE EDITOR. The church of this parish stands about half a mile south west from the town, and is wholly modern ; having been constructed on the exact situation of the former, so as to adopt its handsome and well-proportioned tower. The new church was built about the middle of the last century, when attention to propriety in adapting architectural de signs to their respective uses, civil or religious, seems to have been at its lowest state of depression. This and the church at Helston, constructed nearly about the same time, present in the interior one large room, much more resembling a gymnasium for training cavalry, than a place for religious worship. This parish, with Crowan and Lelant, are dedicated to St. Uny, or St. Unine, of whom nothing is known, and therefore conjecture represents this saint as one of the mis sionaries from Ireland. The advowson of the rectory is appurtenant to the honor and manor of Tehidy, which has been in the Basset family since early times of the Planta genets. In the town a chapel has very recently been built, pro bably near to the spot where the one formerly stood, that was dedicated to St. Rumon, of whom little more is known than of St. Uny. The abbey of Tavistock was dedicated to the honor of Almighty God, in the names of the Blessed Virgin and of St. Rumon, by Ordgar Earl of Devonshire, about the year 960, and confirmed by King Ethelred about twenty years"], [399, "385 REDRUTH. after. In Leland's Collectanea de Rebus Britannicis, vol. IV. p. 152, are noticed the following heads of a Life of Rumon : \"i Rumonus genere suit Scotus Hiberniensis.

Wilson, upon information given him by certain persons of that country, inserted his name on this day (January the 4th) in the second edition of his English Martyrology.\" Since there seems to be very little probability in the sup position that the name of this parish can have reference to the Druids; and as two strong objections may be alleged against its being derived from a ford of red water, from the absence of any red stream, or ford ; is it too hardy to con jecture, that with variations in the orthography, and in the pronunciation of the name, and perhaps with some adjunct syllable, the long-soiight-sor etymology may be found in a patron saint, when three other parishes, Ruan Major, Ruan Minor, and Ruan Lanihorn, are dedicated to his name. In consequence of the immense extension of workings on lodes of copper all round the northern and eastern junc tions of the forest granite, with the killas or slate, the town of Redruth has grown into a large size, and into consider able opulence. The main street is rendered splendid on both sides by continued lines of shops, and the market on Friday is supplied in great abundance with every thing that can be wanted in the ordinary concerns of life. Large quantities offish, of pork, and of home manufactures, espe cially of shoes, are brought from Penzance market, held on vol. hi. 2 c"], [400, "386 REDRUTH. the preceding day, so that the road over Hayle Causeway is thronged with carts throughout the intervening night; and the long street of Redruth is scarcely adequate to contain the people who come there from all these populous mining districts, although a new and spacious market place has been constructed within about thirty years, on the south side of the main street, in which all the standings were previously fixed. Much more recently a bell tower and clock have been added, by the liberality of the late Lord Dunstanville. To the northward of Redruth, and running nearly parel lel with it, lies the village of Plengwary, a name undoubt edly connected with the Amphitheatre or Round, which, till within half a century, remained distinctly marked adjacent to it. See Doctor Borlase's Antiquities, second edition, p. 208 ; and his Natural History, p. 297, and all that is stated on this subject respecting the Round in Perran Zabuloe. That gwary means a play or exhibition of games and sports, cannot admit of a doubt. In Lhuvd's Arch\u00e6ologia Britannica, theatrum is rendered in Cornish guardy. But Mr. Tonkin's exposition of the first syllable, plan or plen, by flat, level, is very doubtful, being sounded perhaps on no other basis than an accidental coincidence in sound with an English word. This village, frequently called Little Redruth, is not only grown into a town, but extends so as almost to join the larger portion. A curious document relative to this parish was placed in my hands by the Rev. Samuel Gurney, during thirty-two years vicar of St. Erth, and for many years preceding curate of Redruth.

Wheat was sold at 39 or 40 shillings per bushel (the treble Winchester bushel, or 24 gallons) ; Barley at 28 shillings per bushel, on Saturday the 27th Au gust, at Helstone, being their market day. On the next mar ket day the barley was sold for 7 or 8 shillings per buhels. This array was made three years subsequent to the Cornish insurrection, when Michel Joseph and Thomas Flammock led their followers to Blackheath in Kent. Having omitted to notice in its proper place under Illuggan, the very remarkable coincidence between the measurements of former times and of our own, in respect to the honor and manor of Tehidy, it will not be improper to do so here. The Cornish, in adopting the Saxon word acre (\u00e6cen) applied it in the most extraordinary manner, either through utter ignorance of its meaning, or from an absurd attempt to designate by this term a previously existing measure of their own, between two and three hundred times as large. The Saxon acre in its true extent, was however adopted afterwards in Cornwall, consisting of one hundred and sixty square poles, each eighteen feet long. The Normans for some reason quite unknown, reduced the length of the pole from eighteen to sixteen feet and a half, and thus estab lished the difference between Saxon or customary, and Norman or statute acres. They differ in the proportion 18 squared to 16| squared, or as 12 squared to eleven squared, that is as 144 to 121. As 6 to 5 for any approxi mate conversion, and as 25 to 21 very nearly. This Saxon acre continues, up to the present time, in very general use throughout Cornwall, and is the measure by which wood lands are estimated in most parts of England. The absurdly denominated old Cornish acre, is believed to contain 280 Norman acres. Mr. Carew, so. 4-6 of the original edition, p. 131 of Lord Dunstanville's, gives the measurement in these Cornish acres, of various manors and lands as they were returned before the King's Justices at Launceston, in the 12th year"], [403, "389 REDRUTH. of the reign of Edward the First, A.

The abbreviation \"Decunar.\" stands in Mr. Carew's list before de Tehidi ; but no word beginning with these letters can be found either in >Spelm;in's Glossary, or in that of Ducange. It is impossible for me to turn away from this incidental mentioning of Tehidy, without adding, that scarcely had the press closed on the notes respecting Illuggan, containing a most imperfect and inadequate tribute to the virtues, to the manly character, to the liberality and steady private friend ship of its proprietor, then in a state of bodily affliction demanding the commiseration of every one, when the final scene of life came to an end, and he was no more. The event took place on the 5th of February, 1835. Lord Dunstanville now claims neither our commiseration nor our pity : he has nobly performed the part assigned him by Providence, and we doubt not is receiving the just reward; but by an unanimous impulse the whole popula- tion of Cornwall have resolved on recording to future ages, not so much his merits, for that would be superfluous, as their own high sense, consciousness, find estimation of them ; and not without the hope that such memorials may tend to excite all persons in their different stations and degrees of life to emulate examples so recorded.

A small triangular portion, forming the extreme southern part of this parish, rests on granite, as does also an irregular tract on the south-eastern boundary ; but all the remainder, that is by far the greater part of the parish, is situated on felspathic rocks, belonging to the porphyritic series, which are very metalliferous, constituting, with similar rocks in Camborne and Gwennap (all surrounding the same central mass of granite) the most important mining district in Cornwall."], [405, "391 ROACH or ROCHE. HALS. Roach is situate in the hundred of Powdre, and hath upon the north St. Wenn and Withell, east Luxsillian, South St. Austell, West St. Dennis. For the name, in old Gaulish British it signifies a rock of stone, not unsuit able to the natural circumstances of this place ; where, on a level piece of ground, stands the loftiest single ragged rock this county can shew, at least thirty foot high, and by it several other rocks of less magnitude. In the Domesday Book, 20 William I. 1087, this dis trict was partly taxed under the jurisdiction of Tre-roach, that is the rock town, now Tre-garrek, or Trecarrek, (i. e. the rock town, also in Cornish,) the voke lands of the still notable manor or lordship here so called ; from whence may be inferred, that before the Norman Conquest here was an endowed rectory church, called Roch (i. *e. Rock), and the village adjoining, still Roach Town, and Roach Church Town. Moreover, in the inquisition of the bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, Ecclesia de Rupe, in decanatu de Powdre, i. e. after the Latin, the church of the Rock, or the Rock church, was valued \u00a36. 6s. 8d.

Moreover, in this parish, whereof I treat, upon the top of the stony rock before mentioned, is still extant the moor stone walls, durnes, and windows (the roof long since"], [406, "392 ROACH, OR ROCHE. dilapidated or demolished by time), an ancient chapel for divine service; though now, by reason the old stone stairs ascending thereto are pulled down by the tenants of the manor aforesaid, and converted to common uses, the access thereto is very difficult and dangerous. The wall consists of about twenty feet in length, ten feet in height, and about twelve in breadth ; one part of it is cut by art out of the natural rock, about thirty feet high from the ground ; the other part built of lime and stone, so strong and curious, that neither time, wind, nor weather can yet disfigure it. In its garret over, as appears by the beam holes, there was formerly a lodge or planchin (both which as aforesaid, long since, with the roof, are fallen to the ground). In this chapel wall is towards the east a large moorstone window where the altar stood, with a moor stone door or durns on the south for entrance, and another such door leading to the west, through which you are brought out into a little garden plot and tye-pit on the Rock, that overlooks the country many miles round. Who built this chapel, whether the De Rupes, lords thereof, or others, it is not recorded, nor at what time. But most certain it is, that from this stone rock, the chapel, church, and parish have the denomination Roach. Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, p. 139, (p. 321 Lord Dunstanville's edit.) tells us, that near this rock there is another, which having a pit in it, containeth water, which ebbs and flows as the sea doth. I was thereupon very curious to inspect this matter, and sound it was only a hole artificially cut in a stone about twelve inches deep and six broad ; wherein, after rayne, a pool of water stands; which, afterwards with fair weather vanished] away and is dried up; and then again on the falling of rain water is reple nished accordingly; which, with dry weather, abates as afore said (for upon those occasions I have seen it to have water in its pit, and again to be without it), which doubtless gave occasion to the feigned report that it ebbs and flows as the sea: of all which premisses thus speaks Mr. Carew further out of the Ccrnish Wonder-Gatherer:"], [407, "393 ROACH, OR ROCHE.

For heretofore every other parish in Cornwall, upon the highest lands of their said parish, had one of those bickens, beckeners, or beacons, for the same end and purposes.

This parish takes its name from, and is dedicated to St. Roche, born at Montpelier in France, of which city his father was lord. After his father and mother were dead, though but then twenty years of age, he took a resolution to dispose of part of his estate, which he distributed amongst the poor, left the administration of the remainder to his uncle, and from a prince became a pilgrim. He took the way to Rome, and both in his journey thither, and in that city, cured several people of the plague, by making only the sign of the cross. Being at last attacked by it himself, he withdrew into a wood, where a neighbouring gentleman's"], [410, "396 ROACH, OR ROCHE. dog brought him every day a loaf of bread; at last, being cured, he returned to his own country, but it being in trou blesome times, he was taken up for a spy, and by his uncle (who did not know him) shut up in prison, where he suf fered incredible evils ; and dying there in 1327, he was at Last discovered by a writing found about him.

W.] This parish was valued (Tax. Ben.) in anno 1291, 20 Edw. I. at \u00a36. 6s. 8d. having never been appropriated. There being several manors in this parish, I shall begin with one of the largest extent, royalties, &c. viz. the manor of Tregarick, so called by corruption [rather by the customary variation of a letter in composition, from carick, a rock, the dwelling of the rock, as having in it the famous great rock, which (as is said above) gave the name to this parish. W.] This was antiently the seat of a family of the"], [411, "397 ROACH, OR ROCHE. same name, whose pedigree I have not been able to recover, or to say any more of them, than that John Tregarrek was knight of the shire, 7 Richard II. ; [and that] the last of them, Tregarick, left only one daughter and heir, Matilda, married to Ralph Trenowth of Fentongollan, esq. anno , by whom she had only one daughter and heir Johanna, who .as being heir to her mother, carried this manor to her husband, Hugh Boscawen of Tregothnan, esq. anno [about 1400, see Peerage.] Ever since which it hath been in the possession of this family, the Lord Viscount Falmouth being the present lord thereof. [Authors cannot always draw conclusions from their own premises : we have an instance of this here. The parish of Roch has no relation to the noble pilgrim of France. It was called Roch before this saint was born ; and the saint of the church was St. Conant,' whose memory is still preserved by his well on Trefrank, his park and meadow, cor ruptly called St. Gonnet's. But this saint was afterwards superseded by a more modern one, a nameless one, who, actuated with the spirit of the pilgrim in France, renounced the world, retired to this rock, built a small house of stone upon a point at one end of it, and there spent his d.ays in hermetical devotions. The house is still entire in the shell of it, having a small sort of common window at the outer end of it, and a little flat for a garden upon one side ; this, from its proximity to the church and church town, was very near to the haunts of men for a hermitage, but it was raised upon a most extraordinary mass of rock, that here rises upon the ridge of a heath in a rough and huge kind of carcass, and spreads in its large limbs to a considerable distance along the heath. On a tall and pillar-like spire of this rock, ascendible only by a ladder, is the hermitage, and the view from it must have been then, not much more wild and savage than it is at present ; the house and lands of Tregarick being just under it. Indeed, the hermitage must have been built by the family itself, as it is planted upon their ground. Even one of the family I suppose was"], [412, "398 ROACH, OR ROCHE. the very hermit. Nor could it have been constructed for this purpose at any period earlier than 1291, as appears from the Valor of Edward, which calls the parish only Roche, and knows of no saint of the name; the look of the whole building, and the form of the window particularly, concur to fix the hermit probably as late as the year 1400, and to mark him perhaps for the last of the Tregaricks. Deprived of all male issue, he perhaps grew disgusted with the world, resigned up his mansion and his estate to his daughter, and devoted himself for the remainder of his life to poverty, to sequestration, and to prayer; and from the natural tendency of mankind to revere those virtues of self denial and devoutness in others, which they are too gross and too indulgent to practise themselves; he became revered in his life, he was canonized after his death, and the parish took its denomination from its native saint, its saint of the rock, and its own St. Roche, preferring him to its old saint, Conant, and for his sake attaching the name of saintship to its old name of Roche. W.] THE EDITOR. Roach rock and tower are very conspicuous objects. The tower, like some others in that neighbourhood, is lofty and without pinnacles. The rock is in itself the most remarkable object in all that range of crystaline formations, and it is crowned by the building described by Mr. Hals, which bears every appearance of having been the cell of an anchorite, a Stylites, or pillar saint, so far as this climate would admit. Mr. Lysons, but without quoting any authority, siiys it was dedi cated to St. Michael. Mr. Whitaker, clearly drawing on the resources of his own fancy, has transformed Gunett or Gundred, the traditionary daughter of the Leper who retired to this place, into a masculine saint, whom he names St. Conant, and to whom Mr. Whitaker says, that not only the hermitage but the church is dedicated."], [413, "399 ROACH, OR ROCHE. As Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Lysons have failed of produc ing any document, or of alleging any tradition worthy of the smallest reliance, it may fairly be concluded that nothing is known with respect to the origin or specific use of this cell. It may therefore have been constructed as they think, by some proprietor of a neighbouring estate impelled by the insane mythology then in fashion, for it cannot be called religion ; and afterwards, as appears to have been the case in various other situations, it may have been used for a place of penitentiary exile from St. Petrock's Monastery. Mr. Lysons has given a perspective view, and an exact plan of this building, accompanied by measurements, from which it appears to be 14 feet 8 inches long, by 10 feet 6 inches wide, and the wall about 2 feet 3 inches thick, except at the south-eastern end, where the wall is laid down 3 feet 6 inches. No one can wish to see this building again appropriated to its former superstitious purposes ; but it may be a fair subject of regret, that such a remnant of antiquity should not be protected from injury by the addition of a roof. Mr. Treweeke, the incumbent mentioned by Mr. Hals, was succeeded by Mr. John Tregenna, who held also the rectory of Mawgan in Pider, and on his decease in 1754, the Rev. Samuel Furley was nominated by a Society in London, who had purchased this and other livings, espe cially in populous places, for the avowed purpose of incul cating specific religious opinions. At Roach it is under stood that benefit has resulted to the inhabitants from these appointments, and certainly no clergyman could be more exemplary in the discharge cf his parochial duties, or more liberal in his conduct, than the able and intelligent indivi dual and excellent scholar who, to the regret of the whole neighbourhood, has recently retired from the arduous care of a flocM|* consisting chiefly of stream-work miners, the least cultivated portion of a class of men, in general much exceeding the average population of this kingdom in general"], [414, "400 ROACH, OR ROCHE. knowledge, and consequent good conduct, in relation to their duties both in public and in private life. Yet, notwithstanding this instance, the Editor cannot but think that such a system of mortmain for making church patronage permanently subservient to self-constituted bodies, as the medium for giving currency to peculiar doctrines, thus erecting mere wealth into an hierarchy as well as an aristocracy in this kingdom, requires a prohibition from the legislature ; more especially as the desire and the zeal for acquiring proselytes have been found in all times, in all nations, and under every form of religion, not to bear a very strict relation either to the soundness of doctrine, or to the virtues such doctrine may be likely to produce. It is clearly impossible that this parish can have been dedicated to St. Roche, since the name occurs in the Valu.a tion of Pope Nicholas made about the year 1291, where, under the Deanery of Pouder, stands : Ecclesia de Roupe, Taxatio, \u00a36. 6s. 8d. Decima, 12s. 8d. while St. Roche is said to have died in 1327, forty-six years afterwards ; and if that were not sufficient, the name occurs in the Domesday Survey made two hundred years before the time of Pope Nicholas, and two hundred and fifty be sore that of the saint. The similarity of the sounds \u2014 parish of the Rock, and parish of St. Roche, \u2014 may have occasioned a subsequent adoption of this saint : of whom it is stated, from the very scanty materials remaining to make out his life, that having left Montpellier, the place of his birth, to proceed on a pilgrimage to Rome, he encountered the plague at the city of Placentia; that not obtaining any assistance or human help, after that most dreadful disease had manifested itself on his person, he got into a wood where dogs mira culously afforded him all the aid in their power, after a manner suggested by the parable of Lazarus. Getting well, he bestowed on others in the town that help which had been refused to himself; and fully satisfied with this effort"], [415, "ROACH, OR ROCHE. 401 on behalf of humanity, he returned into France, and spent the remainder of his life in idleness and solitude. He is fervently adored, and his aid entreated, over France and Italy, as the individual to whom Almighty God has delegated the care and superintendence of all cutaneous complaints or exterior ulcers ; and it is rather curious that throughout Cornwall a congeries of pimples is denominated a roach up to the present time.

THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. The grand geological feature of this interesting parish is the large mass of granular shorl rock, which towers above the adjacent country. It has all the appearance and form (so far as regards the mechanical structure of this mass) of a projecting tor of granite, such as commonly cap the most elevated hills in Cornwall : but a nearer examination shows that it is a compound of shorl and quartz. This rock is entirely surrounded by a felspathic slate, being about a mile distant from the granite. St. Mewan Beacon is an instance of another large tor of shorl rock, a notice of which was omitted under the head of St. Mewan ; this rock differs however from that of Roach in having a base of compact crystalline quartz, throughout which the shorl is dissemi nated in various proportions. Its position is also different, for that rises immediately out of the granite. The southern part of Roach parish reposes on granite ; VOL III. 2 D"], [416, "402 RUAN LANIHORNE. the remainder on rocks of the porphyritic series. It cor responds in its geological structure with the parish of St. Dennis. RUAN LANIHORNE. HALS. Is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north the river Vale, east Kuby, south Verian, west Egles Ross or Philley. As for the first name, if it be compounded of Ruan-Lawn-y-horne, it signifies the iron oak grove rest, temple, or place of tranquillity and repose, referring to the then natural circumstances of the place, heretofore consisting of old decayed groves of oaks, whose withered tops were like home or iron : of which sort of timber Leland in his Itinerary assures us the river Vale was surrounded. But if Ruan be a corruption of, or derived from the Latin ruina, ruin\u00e6, it signifies woe, destruction, ruin, extreme decay, death, misery, loss, falling down, danger, mischief. Note also, that ruo is to fall, rush, run headlong with great violence, to subvert, overthrow, beat down, batter, or de- stroy. Probably at the time of the Norman Conquest this is that district taxed in the Domesday Book under the name of Richan, otherwise under the jurisdiction of Govile, Tre thay, or Trefiles. In the inquisition of the bishops of Lin coln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, it was rated by the name of Ecclesia de Largess home, in decanatu de Powdre, cvis. viiie/.

This parish was rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax, 1696, by the name of Ruan Lannyhorne, ,\u00a3108. 1 Is. Od. as aforesaid. It is also vulgarly called Lary-horne, i. e. iron floor or ground church ; per haps from the stone pavement of its floor. Tregage, alias Tregago, alias Trejago, synonymous words, a place that heretofore was the vokelands of a manor or tithing : which place gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen, from thence after the French mode surnamed de Tregago, or Trejago, some of which built Trejiigo house and castle, situate upon the vale, creek, or river here, and yet extant in this place, in the reigns of some of the first Norman princes. Note further, that Jago, Gago, in the Scotts and Irish tongues, signifies, as innis and insula, an island, in British and Latin. (See Floyd's Scotts-Irish Dictionary.) Also that in this parish is the manor dwelling called Tre-lonk, Tre-lonck, id est, the buttery or house that hath store of food or provisions for housekeeping. TONKIN. Ruan Lanihorne is in the hundred of Powder, and is bounded to the west by Philly, to the north by the river Fale, to the east by St. Cuby, to the south by Verian. In anno 1291, 20 Edward I. this church was valued at cvis. viiicZ. having never been appropriated. As for the adjunct of Lan-y-horne, or rather Hoarn, that is, the church of iron, I believe it took it from the castle near it, as being in those times a place of great note and strength with this castle, than as being the principal place in this parish, and the seat of the patrons, I shall begin with the description of it; which, though more properly Lanyhorne Castle, was commonly called Ruan castle : it stood by the south of the church at no great distance from it, the rectory house being 2 i) 2"], [418, "404 RUAN LANIHORNE. between them, in a pleasant situation enough, on the edge of a creek, into which a small rivulet empties itself; and the river Fale, which is here of a considerable breadth, when the tide is in, and surrounded formerly with woods, which are now mostly destroyed. Leland gives account of the state of it in his time : \" from Tregony to passe doune by the body of the haven of Falamuth, to the mouth of Lany horne creeke or hille, on the soutb-est side of the haven, is a 2. miles. This creeke goith up half a mile from the principale streame of the haven. At the hed of this creeke standith the castelle of Lanyhorne, sumtyme a castel of 8. tourres, now decaying for lak of coverture ; it longgid as principal house to the Archedecons. These landes descendid by heires general to the best Corbetes of Shrop shir, and to Vaulx of Northamptonshir. Vaulx part syns bought by Tregyon of Cornewaul.\" By this one may guess what a stately castle this formerly was ; for in my time was only one tower of the castle standing, which was so large, that if the others were equal to it, the whole build ing must be of a prodigious magnitude ; but I fancy this was the body of the whole, for there is not room enough about it for so great a pile : so that I believe the eight towers mentioned by Leland were only turrets and .append ages to this principal part. I wish I had taken a draught of it in season (as I often intended) ; for this too was pulled down in or about the year 1718, by Mr. Grant, who having obtained leave from the lord to do it, erected several houses with the materials, and turned it into a little town, to which ships of about 80 or 100 tons come up, and supply the neighbourhood with coals, timber, &c. as the barges do with sand. But since the writing of this, I am informed that six of the eight towers were standing within these thirty years, of which that which I have mentioned, was the biggest and loftiest, as being at least fifty feet in height. This belongs to the manor of Elerchy, of which I have given a full account in St. Verian, in which the place which gives name to it is seated, though the castle was no doubt"], [419, "RUAN LANIHORNE. 405 the chief seat of its lords.

He was knight in parliament for this county, 33 Edward I. and the 6th, 7th, and 8th, of Edward II. ; Sheriff of the county in the 7th of the same king ; summoned to the House of Lords, 13th Edward II.

WThen Mr. Tonkin wrote, about a hundred and thirty years ago, vessels of a size suf ficient for enabling them to navigate the open sea, came up this creek ; but in common with many other similar estuaries, it has become filled up with alluvial detritus from above, and no longer admits even barges. Near to the church stood a large and magnificent castle. flanked by eight towers, the residence of a very ancient family bearing the name of Arcedekne. Of this family, Thomas le Arcedekne was summoned to Parliament as a Baron, in the Uth year of Edward the Second, A. D. 1321, as was his son John le Arcedekne, in the 16th year of Edward the Third. This last Baron left a son Warine le Arcedekne, who died, leaving three daughters his coheirs. The arms of this family are stated by Mr. Lysons to have been Argent, three chevronels Sable. Of these daughters, Alice became the wife of Walter de Lacy ; and her coheiresses married into the families of Corbett and Vaux. The portion of Vaux having been forfeited, was given in 1462 to Avery Cornburgh, and afterwards belonged to the unfortunate Mr. Tregian. On"], [420, "406 RUAN LANIHORNE. the plunder and confiscation of his property, it was pur chased by Mr. Ezekiel Grosse. The manors of Lanihorne and Eleskey belong to Mr. and Mrs. Gregor, and Mr. Lysons adds, that they were formerly held of the honor of Launceston, by the annual render of a brace of greyhounds. Treviles was the seat of the Lukes, of whom William Luke, esq. held the situation of an admiral. Mr. W'hitaker has added to Mr. Tonkin's manuscript a history of this parish, sufficient in quantity to make a volume of itself, therefore much too long for a portion of this work ; and of which the Editor would not attempt to make an abridgment, since the style discriminates its author, and the detailed quotations from writers little known to the generality of scholars, evince his learning and profound research. Perhaps this example of parochial history may appear at some future time in a substantive form ; but whenever that is done, an addition must be made to it of the most interesting and most important circumstance con nected with this parish : \u2014 the life of Mr. Whitaker him self. It will therefore be sufficient to state here these short particulars. The Rev. John Whitaker was born in the year 1736, at Manchester ; this naturally induced him to write the history of that town, a work which raised its author to a considerable elevation in literary fame. He became a Fel low of Corpus Christi College in Oxford, and retired on this living acquired for the college by purchase from the Earls of Buckinghamshire, heirs of Sir John Maynard. Soon after Mr. Whitaker's arrival in Cornwall he mar ried a lady, heiress of the Tregennas, a family long distin guished in Cornwall, and known throughout England by the fame of one of its members, a lawyer, a wit, and a man of letters, in the reign of Charles the Second. Mr. Whitaker died in November 1808, aged 73, and is buried in the chancel of the parish church with this simple memorial :"], [421, "407 RUAN LANIHORNE. John Whitaker, B.D. Rector. Buried Nov. 14th, 1808, aged 73. He left two daughters, one of whom is married to Richard Taunton, esq. M.D. through whose kindness and liberality Mr. Hals' manuscripts have been placed in the Editor's hands for publication. Mr. Whitaker stands deservedly high in the estimation of the whole literary world, as a man of superior talent, and as an able and brilliant writer in the various departments of theology, politics, biography, general history, and topo graphy ; besides these, he has left sermons and opuscula, which, collected from the British Critic, and from similar repositories, would sill several volumes, all able, but strongly marked by impressions indicating the predominance of fancy, and of an unshakeable determination to support every opinion once entertained, without any reference to the solidity of the foundation on which it may repose ; thus stamping a character of dogmatism, which in theological works would seem to be far better suited to a Church claim ing infallibility, than to one owing its very existence to appeals made from authority to the exercise of private judgment. In biography Mr. Whitaker, carried away by imagination and feeling, has wasted the powers of his mind to \" make the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash maturest counsels,\" in an elaborate and learned effort to vindicate the character of one among the most unprincipled and abandoned females recorded in history, because she was beautiful in her person, and finally paid the forfeit of her crimes in a manner perhaps too protracted and informal, and because the blind chance of birth had placed her in the highest political office of her native country. The following extract from a manuscript of undoubted authority, is given to prove how easily men of the greatest genius may deceive themselves in antiquarian researches, more especially when plausible theories are adopted, and then maintained,' on the fallacious evidences of doubtful"], [422, "408 RUAN LANIHORNE. expressions used by obscure writers, immured perhaps within the walls of cloisters, or removed to considerable distances, both of time and space, from the scene of occur rences pretended to be described, and at periods of our civilization, when no intelligence was circulated, and when the transit of a few miles equalled the fatigue, or exceeded the danger, of modern journeys into distant climates. Mr. Whitaker has printed two volumes in quarto on the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall. One great object of this work, replete like all the others with the most extensive miscellaneous learning, is to prove that no Bishop's see ever existed at Bodmin, and the assertion is maintained with much vehemence of expression, and disregard of individuals the most respected. Even Doctor William Borlase, whose name is consecrated among his countrymen as their boast and their pride, does not escape from invective and contemptuous epithets, for having maintained the affirmative in regard to the existence of this see. The Reverend Josiah Forshall, late Fellow of Exeter College, and now Keeper of the Manuscripts in the British Museum, has had the goodness to favour me with the following communication. [The Volume from which the following entries are t.aken, is a copy of the Four Gospels in the Vulgate Version, formerly belonging to the Church of St. Petroc, and probably at an early period one of its chief treasures. It appears to be of the Ninth Cen- tury, and would perhaps by some critics be assigned toastill more remote date. The ornaments of the Am- monian Harmony prefixed, of the initial capitals, and of a page which is found immediately before the Gospel of St. John, are rude and curious, and strongly resemble those which are to be met with in very ancient Mss. executed in Ireland. The volume is in quarto, of rather an oblong form, and"], [423, "409 RUAN LANIHORNE. is very neatly written, though evidently by a scribe not well informed or of great learning even for those times. It was purchased by a London Bookseller at the sale of a private library in Oxfordshire, about three years ago, and soon afterwards sold to the British Museum, where it is now deposited and designated by the No. 938 1 . The entries seem to be contemporaneous with the manumissions which they record.] ] .

(son and daughter of Sir Peter Killigrew, Baronet) by whom he had issue one only daughter named ; which lady and her said daughter, after some years' cohabitation with Mr. Erisey, upon some discontent eloped from him, and by no entreaties could be persuaded to a reconcilement or return to her said husband, or to restore his daughter on her begotten, to his possession, which she kept with her; whereupon, in the year 1701, Mr. Erisey brought down a trial at law against Mr. Lister, cognominatus Killigrew, his brother-in-law, before Mr. Justice Blencowe at Lanceston, who then also lodged and detained his said daughter from him ; upon which trial at the crown bar, Mr. Killigrew aforesaid and his niece appeared, when it was manifested to the court that he laid no restriction upon the young lady ; but, if she would, she might at any time go to her father's house: yet her eloped mother so influenced her, that the judge nor court could not prevail with her to do it, though her father Mr. Erisey was then and there also in court ready to receive her with tears, she being the heir-at* law both to his and much of her grandfather Sir Peter Killygrew's lands ; so that from Lanceston she went again to her mother, with the said Mr. Lister Killygrew, and was afterwards married to one captain or colonel West, a soldier of fortune, by whom 1 hear she had two daughters now living : after which she died, her father and mother living in a separate state as aforesaid: of which gentleman, Mr. Erisey's vexation and trouble for the loss of his wife's company, I am informed its parallel to that of Hector's, whom Homer makes thus to speak. vol. ni. 2 E"], [432, "418 RUAN MAJOR.

From whence it appears that Homer and Hector thought a good and righteous marriage the only happy state of human life ; for a good, faithful, and loving wife brings up the husband's children in order, governs his family, saves his substance, rules his house as well as increases his offspring, with the greatest faithfulness and integrity. And if any charge or labour happen, for no state of human life is without a cross, verily this only is that light burden and sweet yoke which is found only in honest wed lock : especially if the wife be such as Hector's was, in whom no avarice, nor pride, nor deceit, nor covetousness, nor fraud, was found that joined them together. One of those Eriseys dancing with other gentlemen and ladies at Whitehall, before King James I. through the violent motion and action of his body in the middle of the dance, had his cap slip from his head, and fall to the ground, but he instantly with his foot tossed it on his head again, and proceeded without let or hindrance with his part in that dance, to the admiration of all that saw it, which gave occasion to King James to inquire who that active gentleman was; and being told that his name was Erisey, he forthwith replied, I like the gentleman very well, but not his name of Heresy.

The only place in this small parish requiring the least notice is Cadgwith or Cagewith, a moderately sized fishing cove, and heretofore celebrated for its lucrative trade, while the rights of the duchy were practically maintained against the admission of all coercive laws, relative either to the Customs or to the Excise. The principal part of this parish anciently belonged to die distinguished family of Carminow. Mr. Lysons says, that on the partition of their property between heiresses, the lands in Ruan Minor were allotted to Trevarthian, whose heiress brought them to the Resky- mers, who had them in 1620; they were afterwards in the Bellots, of whom the property was purchased by Robinson of Nanceloe, and alienated from them to an adventurer called Fonnereau, who having obtained a seat in Parliament, procured a lucrative bargain for constructing lighthouses on the Lizard Point. Having ultimately become a bankrupt, or died insolvent, every thing that he had purchased was again sold, and the lands in this parish were bought by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, about the year 1780, and they now belong, under a special devise, to his brother's second son."], [438, "424 RUAN MINOR.

There is little remarkable about the church and tower, although they are pleasing objects in various directions. The church contains monuments to some former vicars, and also to Mrs. Bird. This lady was the only daughter of Mr. William Wayne, a gentleman brought from Bristol to instruct the newly established copper smelting company at Hayle, in the requisite branches of metallurgy. He mar ried in Cornwall, and his daughter succeeded to a portion of the very considerable property left by Mr. Abell Angove of Trevenson. Miss Wayne was born at St. Erth in 1762, married Mr. Bird a gentleman of Devonshire in 1785 ; and having be come a widow, died near Plymouth in 1803, without leav ing any family. Several of her maternal relations had been buried here. The great tithes belong to the Chapter of Exeter, who are patrons of the vicarage, which is endowed with the lord ship of a manor. This parish has to boast of a consecrated well, efficacious for restoring health to children, and indebted for its virtues probably to St. Ejuiy, as the remains of a chapel dedicated to that saint are near the well. Mr. Hals has a long dissertation on the various creeds professed at different times in the Christian church, and fancies that this -hWse- may indicate an assumption by the inhabitants of the one most holv of all. This is omitted."], [441, "427 SANCREED. It seems, however, to be worth remarking, that all the peo ple of the county used to pronounce the word san-crist ; and this, joined with the fast of the parish feast being celebrated, not in honor of any particular saint, but at Whitsuntide, may be sufficient for suggesting a query at least, whether the church is not really dedicated to the Saviour of Mankind. Drift in this parish, was formerly the residence of the Trew-rens, or more probably Tre-wren, which is said to mean the fair and handsome town. The family removed to Trewardreva in Constantine, and Drift was sold about sixty years ago, by the last Mr. Trewren. Tregonnebris, stated by Mr. Lysons to be the only manor in the parish, belongs to Mr. Buller of Downs, derived from Ezekiel Grosse. The barton was held for many years under lease for lives by a branch of the Lan yons, and so entirely bare of trees is this district, that every child in the west of Cornwall is acquainted with the tale of a Mr. Longer of Tregonnebris, being terrified by a sup posed attack of robbers when he first heard the hooting of an owl. / i owl. / The late vicar Mr. Seehell held also the vicarage of St Just.

St. Sennen is situate in the hundred of Penwith, and hath upon the north St. Just, south St. Levan, east Buryan, west the Land's End and the Atlantic Ocean. As for the name, if it be compounded of Sen-nan, it signifies the holy valley ; but most likely the name is derived from the tutelar guardian and patron of this church. At the time of the Norman Conquest this district was taxed under the jurisdiction of Buryan, on which it is still dependant in spirituals as a daughter church. And if this church were extant, and endowed at the time of the first inquisition into the value of Cornish Benefices 1294, it then was rated also under Buryan. Lastly, this parish was rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax 1696, at \u00a357. 12*. Od. by the name of Sennan. Upon view of this church 1700, the sexton shewed me the headless bodies of some images of human shape cut in alabaster, that were not long before found hid in the walls of the same, all curiously wrought, which also had been painted with gold, vermillion, and blue bice, on several parts of their garments. He also shewed me an inscription on the foot of the font stone, which he told me several Bishops of Exeter and their priests, in their triennial visitations at Buryan and this church, had viewed and inspected, but could not read it; whereupon, in like manner, I observed on the font-stone the said inscription in a barbarous strange character or letters, of which I could see but part, by rea- son a new pew or seat was built on a part of it; however, I interpreted that which I saw to consist of these letters, Anno Dom. mille ccccxx or xl, in the year of our Lord 1420 or 1440.

See Floyd, page 218 ; and sleane is a conger fish in Cornish ; and 1 illy, silli, is an ele or eele, in that language. See Floyd on Anguilla. This parish affords very little wheat corn, by reason it is a naked country exposed to the wind and sharp air of the sea in winter season, which washes or frets the same out of the ground at that time, unless it stands in the valleys or close places between the hills against the south or east ; never theless it is abundantly supplied with barley corn, the soil producing, generally, with little husbandry or cultivation, twenty Cornish bushels in most acres ; that is to say, about sixty Winchesters. In this parish is situate the most remote north-west promontory or head-land of the Island of Great Britain, where it is not above an arrow's flight breadth (at the end thereof), the lands naturally or gradually declining from .St. Just, and Chapel Carne Braye, four miles distant, to this place, and the sea at least eighty fathom under those places ; where, as it were in a low valley, it meets the waves of the Atlantic Sea, or West Ocean, and parts some of the Irish Sea and British Channel asunder by its horned promon tory of land ; which shows that opinion and tradition of the lands extending further west of old towards Scilly, to be a vulgar error and a fable ; for if it had stretched more"], [444, "430 SENNEN. westerly than it doth in this lower valley, and no higher pitch or degree, the flux and reflux of the sea or tides would inevitably overflow it. Or had there been any con siderable parcel of ground there broke off from the insular continent of Britain, (as tradition saith the country of Lioness was,) by some inundation, earthquake, or accidental concussion, it must have been much higher land than the contiguous country of the Land's End is. Otherwise it could not exist there as aforesaid ; but it is not likely there was ever any such land, since no fracture or disjointing of the earth appears on the confines or summit thereof. Though at low water there is to be seen far off' towards Scilly, (probably so called from the abundance of eel or con ger fishes taken there, called sillys or lillis,) for a mile or more a dangerous strag of ragged rocks, amongst which the Atlantic Sea, and the waves of St. George's and the British Channel meeting, make a dreadful bellowing and rumbling noise at half ebb and half flood : which let seamen take notice of, to avoid them. Of old there was one of those rocks more notable than the rest, which, tradition saith, was ninety feet above the flux and reflux of the sea, with an iron spire at the top thereof, which was overturned or thrown down by a violent storm 1647, and the rock broken in three pieces. This iron spire, as the additions to Camden's Britannia inform us, was thought to have been erected there by the Romans, or set up as a trophy there by King Athelstan when he first conquered the Scilly Islands (and was in those parts) ; but it is not very probable such a piece of iron in this salt sea and air, without being consumed by rust, could endure so long a time. However it is or was, certain I am it commonly was called in Cornish, An Marogeth Arvowed, i. e. the armed knight; for what reason I know not, except erected by or in memory of some armed knight ; as also carne-an peul, id est, the spile, spire, pole, or javelin rock.

This parish takes its name from its tutelar saint St. Sen nan, or Sinninus, an Irish Abbat, who (saith Leland) was at Rome with St. Patrick, and came over from Ireland to Cornwall with St. Breage. The church hath dedicated the 30th of June to his memory. It is a daughter church to St. Burien, and is valued, together with that and St. Levan, in the King's Book, at \u00a348. 12s. [The passage alluded to above as in Leland, is this, and in Itin. III. 15, \" Breaca,\" he says, out of a Life of St. Breage which he met with in Cornwall, \" venit in Cornu biam, comitata multis Sanctis; inter quos fuerunt Sinninus Abbas, qui Rom\u00e6 cum Patritio suit.\"] THE EDITOR. This parish is greatly distinguished as being the most western in England, and containing within it the promon tory, which, without reference to the cardinal points, evi dently terminates the granite chain, which stretching out from Dartmoor, extends by links, apparent at intervals at the surface, to this point, the most distant on the conti nent of England. The same range appears again in the Scilly Islands, and it may possibly join the similar granitic districts in France. It is a very curious circumstance, that, notwithstanding the great numbers of square leagues composed entirely of"], [446, "432 SENNEN. granite in Cornwall and in Devonshire, that magnificent rock never appears in the cliff except for a few miles on each side of the Land's End ; but there it is seen piled in high masses one on the other, which, coupled with the great Atlantic swell of the waves, present a general effect the most magnificent that can well be imagined. And what adds still more to the grandeur of the scene, about a mile from the extreme point, a lofty range of rocks, called the Longships, rises out of the sea. On the most elevated point of this rock a light-house was constructed about fifty years ago, nearly after the model of Mr. Smeaton's building on the Eddystone ; this column has the advantage, how ever, of standing at a great height above the water, so as, perhaps, never to receive an actual blow from the most vio lent wave ; yet so tempestuous is the sea, that for three months together all communication has been intercepted between the lampmen and the shore. The latitude and longitude of the Land's End appear, from the Trigonometrical Survey, to be, latitude 50\u00b0 4' 7\"; longitude 5\u00b0 41' 32\"; in time 22m. 46s. west from Green wich. The church of this parish is a very conspicuous object in every direction. It is on the usual plan of churches in this district, and is built of granite with a granite tower. In it are some monuments, particularly to the Ellises, who have relinquished the three eels mentioned by Mr. Hals as an armorial bearing, and instead have sculptured on these stones the blazon appropriated to the name throughout England, Argent, on a cross Sable five crescents of the Field. The church town has a pretty good inn, capable of affording entertainment, and even beds to parties \u2014 Led by the fable of Belerus old, Or the Great Vision of the Guarded Mount. This inn is distinguished by a sign bearing two inscrip tions suited to its peculiar situation. Travellers proceed-"], [447, "433 SENNEN. ing to the Land's End, find the board inscribed with these words, The last public house in England ; returning, they see on the other side, The first public house in England About half a mile further eastward than the church town, is a village called Mean, probably from the great number of large rocks interspersed among the houses. In the very midst of the village is a large flat rock, on which three kings are reported to have dined together at some remote period ; and a prophecy of Merlin is added to the tale, that a larger number of kings will be assembled round this rock for the same purpose previously to some great catastrophe, or to the destruction of the world itself. Not far from Mean is Whitsand Bay, from whence Athelstan is said to have embarked for the Scilly Islands, and to have landed on his return. King Stephen is also said to have landed here ; and King John on his return from Ireland ; and lastly, Perkin Warbeck ; but various other bays have derived a similar n<ame from their white sands, and therefore the honours bestowed on this remote and dan gerous cove may be very doubtful. Mr. Hals has adverted to the fertility of this parish, and noticed the production of twenty Cornish bushels, equal ing sixty Winchester bushels, of barley on one acre. The parish certainly is very fertile, being situated on granite peculiarly abounding in felspar; but the Cornish acre, de rived from the Saxon pole of eighteen feet, exceeds the Norman acre in the proportion of six to five, therefore the produce is reduced to fifty bushels. It is much to be lamented that a variety of measures should remain in different parts of the United Kingdom. In Ireland the pole is 21 feet. Their mile consists, like our own, of 320 poles, but of course exceeds our measure in the proportion of 21 to 16-J, or as 14 to 11. vol. m. 2 f"], [448, "434 SENNEN. The Irish acre, like our own, contains 160 square poles, but exceeds it in the proportion of 21 squared to 16| squared, or as 14 squared to 11 squared, as 196 to 121, as 13 to 8 very nearly. The patron saint selected for this parish by Mr. Hals, is stated to be a Persian of that name, who was seized at Babylon, and delivered to the fury of wild beasts at Rome, which, as in the case of Daniel, became mild and abstained from hurting him ; but here the parallel ends, for Vale rianus, instead of acknowledging the God of one so mira culously preserved, ordered gladiators immediately to kill the saint, and they obeyed. Reference is made to the Agonal of Baronius; but this saint is little known in Eng land or by English writers. A much more likely patron may therefore be discovered with Mr. Tonkin, in another St. Senan, of whom Dr. But ler gives the following account: \" St. Senan, Bishop and Confessor, was born in the county of Hy-Conalls in Ireland, about the latter part of the fifth century, and was a disciple of the Abbots Cassio lus and Natal or Naal. He then travelled for spiritual im provement to Rome, and thence into Britain. In this kingdom he contracted a close friendship with St. David. After his return to Ireland he founded many churches; and a great monastery in Inis Cathaig, an island lying at the mouth of the river Shannon, which he governed, and in which he continued to reside after he was advanced to the episcopal dignity. The abbots his successors, for several centuries, were all bishops till this great diocese was divided into three, namely, Limerick, Killaloe, and Ardfert. \" St. Senan died on the same day and year with St. David ; but he was honoured in the Irish church on the 8th of March. A town in Cornwall bears the name of St. Senan. See his Acts in Colgan, p. 602.\" The Persian saint is said to be honoured on the 30th of July in the Greek church, so that the parish feast, which is"], [449, "435 SENNEN. kept on the nearest Sunday to St. Andrew's day, has not any reference to either of the supposed patrons.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. This parish, like the last, rests only on granite ; at low water, however, some felspathic rocks maybe seen. The granite exhibits the common varieties of this part of Cornwall, and is traversed by porphyritic beds; one of which at Mean is a compound of granular felspar and shorl in various proportions. This kind is of rare occur rence ; it is traversed by veins of quartz, which are occa sionally much intermixed with shorl ; this mineral also abounds in the adjoining granite, but more particularly in the veins by which it is traversed. Whitsand Bay is covered with a testaceous sand like that of St. Ives, of Padstow, and of other places on the north coast ; a large tract of this sand is exposed at low water to the action of the wind, by which it has been drifted in con siderable quantities inland so far as Sennen Green. 2 f 2"], [450, "436 SHEVIOCK. HALS. Sheviock is situate in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north St. German's Creek, east Anthony, west St. German's, south the British channel. At the time of the Norman Conquest this district was taxed under the jurisdiction of the Abbey town, now St. German's. In the inquisition of the Bishop of Lincoln aforesaid 1294, Ecclesia de sSevyock, in decanatu de Est, was rated cvis. viijd. In Wolsey's Inquisition 1521, at ,\u00a326. 14s. \u20ac d. ; and the parish rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax, for one year 1696, at \u00a3166. This church was founded and endowed by those knightly gentlemen, lords of the barton and manor aforesaid, sur named Daunye or Dawney. Mr. Carew tells us in his Survey of Cornwall, that the funeral monuments of two of those knights are yet extant in this church, though the inscriptions about them are worn out by time. Ceites, this was a very famous and flourishing family on the barton of Shevyock aforesaid, for several descents, till the time of King Richard II. when the sole daughter and heir of Sir John de Dawney, knight, named Emelyn, was married to Edward Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, 13S0, by whom he had issue Edward Courtenay, surnamed the blind, the 12th Earl of Devon, and Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccomb, knight ; the which Edward, at the request of his said mother, by his deed bearing date the 2d of King Henry Fifth, settled upon the said Sir Hugh Courtenay his bro ther, the manors of Gotherington, South Allington, and Stancomb Dawney in Devon, which were the lands of her ancestors the Dawneys. Afterwards, the said Edward died, 7th Henry V. 1418. (See Brooke in his Catalogue of Devon Earls.)"], [451, "437 SHEVIOCK. By this Emelyn Dawney, as traditions amongst the family of the Courtenays have it, Boconock came first into their tribe, though others say that it came to Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccomb, by Lerchdeacon's heir, but more truly that his said mother settled it upon him on his mar riage with Lerchdeacon of Haccomb's heir. One Nicholas de Dawney, 3 Henry IV. held in the hun dred of East, by the tenure of knight service, two knight's fees and a half. (Survey of Cornwall, page 41.) Of the arms of those gentlemen thus speaks Nicholas Upton in his Latin manuscript, before printing was invented 1440. Monsieur Gwilliam Dawney port d'Argent, oue trois popinjays en bend oue deux cottises. Again, Monsieur John Dawney port d'Argent, en une bende Vert trois rose de Or, oue deux costs de Azure ; from whence I infer there were either several families of those Dawneys, that gave different arms, or that in those days they had no positive record of their bearings. One Sir John Dawney, knt. of Cowick, in Yorkshire, Sheriff of that county 35 Henry VIIL gave for his arms, in a field Argent, on a bend cottised Sable, three annulets of the Field, which is the recorded arms of Dawney.

The church has the appearance of being very old, but the exterior does not possess any beauty, and the whole is disfigured by an irregular truncated pyramid adjoined to the western end as a tower. Within, the church is neat although it is unusually small, but containing a series of splendid monuments, ancient and modern. Mr. Carew says, \"The next parish on this river (the Liner) is Sheviock, some time the ancient Daunyes1 inhe ritance, by whose daughter and heir the same (together with other fair possessions) descended to the Earls of De von. In the church there lie two knights of that name, and one of their ladies by her husband's side, having their pictures embossed on their tombs in the side walls, and their arms once painted round about; but now, by the ma lice, not of men, but of time, defaced. They are held to be father and son ; and that the son was slain in our wars"], [453, "439 SHEVIOCK. with France, and was from thence brought home to be here interred ; \" but Mr. Lysons conjectures that one of those monuments is to a Courtenay. \" There runneth .also a tale amongst the parishioners, how one of the Daunyes' ancestors undertook to build the church, and his wife the barn adjoining; and that, casting up their accounts upon finishing of their works, the barn was found to have cost three halfpence more than the church : and so it might well fall out, for it is a great barn, and a little church.\" The advowson belongs to Mr. Carew's descendant, the Rt. Hon. R. P. Carew, of Anthony. The barn, or what remains of it, almost adjoining to the church, adds to the very singular appearance of the whole group. Scarcely any remains of the mansion house, the residence for several ages of a family so distinguished as the Dauneys, can now be discovered. The principal village in this parish is Crofthole, situated on what was till very lately the turnpike road from Tor Point to Leskeard, and just at the point where the road branches off to Looe and Fowey. This village stands nearly on the brow of a lofty cliff, down which the road to Looe descends by repeated turnings. Mr. Lysons says the ancient name was Croftilborowe, and that it possessed a weekly market on Wednesdays, granted to Nicholas Dauney, then Lord cf Sheviock, with a Fair for three days at the Festival of St. James. The market has long been discontinued. The village is at this time far from large, or from presenting any appearance of opulence. Mr. Carew says it then contained but twelve dwellings, and adds one of those coarse tales, which are usually applied as jokes against any small place, endowed with privileges or immunities above what its importance would seem to justify. On the edge of the sea, nearly under Croftshole, is a small pier protecting a narrow beach of sand between rocks, called Forth Wrinkle : it gives shelter to fishing boats and small vessels. The ancient pier, which had stood"], [454, "440 SHEVIOCK. during a great number of years, was destroyed by the violent storm of Feb. 2, 1822. It is however replaced. Trethil belonged for some time to the family of Wallis. The family became represented by two brothers \u2014 John Wallis, who had an only daughter married to Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth ; and Samuel Wal lis, Captain in the Royal Navy, the celebrated circum navigator and discoverer of Otaheite. This gentleman married Miss Betty Hearle of Penryn, and has also left an only daughter, now the widow of the late Samuel Stephens, esq. of Tregenna in St. Ives.

But the absolute royalty and jurisdiction of this river pertained to the ancient earls now dukes of Cornwall, or to the kings of England, in right of their adjacent manor of Helleston in Kerryer ; and for further proof thereof, I will give an ancient testimony out of the pleas of the Crown in the Exchequer 12 Edward I. 1282, (See also Blount's Ancient Tenures, from thence, p. 52.) where we may read these words.

From whence I conclude that this William de Trevelle either had or was keeper of the royalty of this lake or pool by inheritance, and held one Cornish acre of land in Egles derry, that is to say, one hundred and eighty English acres by the tenure of Sergeanty for that purpose, and providing a fishing hook or iron crook and a net, as long as the king should stay or tarry in the manor of Helleston, fishing or so doirg.

There is not any thing remarkable about this parish church ; it is distant no more than a mile and quarter from Breage Church, but divided from it by a deep valley, which runs down to Porthleaven, heretofore a small fishing cove, till some projectors induced credulous persons to con tribute large sums of money, for the purpose of making a harbour for vessels at this place, under the vague pretence of saving human life, a matter on which all mankind are agreed, but without being able to show that their plans would have that effect : assuming it, however, they had the"], [459, "445 SITHNEY. hardihood to solicit from Parliament an impost on all ves sels passing within a certain distance of the Land's End and the Lizard. Several tens of thousands of pounds have been expended on this senseless undertaking, which has utterly failed of its object, and made the small harbour less commodious for boats than it was before. The principal seat in this parish is Penrose, the residence for centuries of a very ancient family bearing the same name, till the heiress of Penrose married Pearce of Penryn, and their only daughter married Alexander Cuming, esq. from Scotland. They parted with this property to Mr. John Rogers of Helston, younger brother of Mr. Hugh Rogers of Treasow in Ludgvan, to whom he ultimately suc ceeded. Mr. John Rogers left an only son Hugh Rogers, Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1770. This gentleman married Ann, daughter of Mr. James of St. Columb. They also left an only son Mr. John Rogers, member of Parliament for West Looe and for Helston : he married Margaret, eldest daughter of Francis Basset, esq. of Tehidy : and died the 22d of February, 1832, leaving a very numerous family. He is succeeded by his eldest son the Rev. John Rogers, Canon Residentiary of Exeter, and Rector of Mawnan. The late Mr. Rogers added very considerably to the property purchased by his grandfather, more especially on the sales by the Arundell family; so that the Penrose domain now extends round the Lake, and affords a scope for improvements, which may convert this place into one of the most beautiful in Cornwall, and such are expected from the talents, liberality, and taste of the present opulent possessor. Antron appears to have been a place of consequence in former times. Mr. Lysons says that it belonged to an ancient family of the same name, from whom it passed with an heiress in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to the Payn ters; that it was purchased of them by the Hoblyns in 1670, and sold by the Rev.

This parish extends from near Wendron Church almost to the Loo Bar, in the form of a long stripe running a little west of south; rather more than a quarter part of this stripe, at its northern extremity, rests on granite ; all the remainder belongs to rocks of the porphyritic series. The extensive workings of Whele Vor mine are partly situated in this parish, which is intersected by numerous veins and courses of porphyry. SOUTHILL. This parish will be found in vol.

Boden-ike aforesaid, was formerly the lands of Pye, who sold it to Tanner ; some of which family afterwards, in the interregnum of Cromwell, turned decimators and seques trators with the Sprys, upon the lands and revenues of the royal laity and clergy of this county, to that degree of hurt and damage, that it occasioned the making of that short litany not yet forgotten in Cornwall : \" From the Pyes and the Spryes, good Lord, deliver us.\" The arms of Pye are, Argent, on a sess A/.ure three escallops of the Field. Lastly, in this place, to refresh the tired reader, I will recount a story of the unfortunate amours of John Tan ner aforesaid, with his lady Madam Windham, to whom he made his first addresses of marriage, and after some time good liking fell deeply into each other's affection ; but the conditions of marriage proposed by Mr. Tanner not being hastily agreed upon by her father Mr. Windham, gave opportunity to Charles Speccott, esq. a gentleman of much greater estate than Mr. Tanner had, to make an overture of marriage to the lady aforesaid, together with a larger settlement in jointure than Mr. Tanner was able to grant or perform ; which proposals were forthwith accepted by Mr. Windham, so that he soon after constrained his daughter, notwithstanding what amours had passed between her and Mr. Tanner, to marry Mr. Speccott. At the news of which cross accident, Mr. Tanner, her former inamorato, was so discontented and perplexed iu mind, that in order to quiet his disturbed soul, and obliterate or extinguish the memory of this beautiful woman (for such she was), he forsook this land and travelled into France. vol. in. 2 a"], [464, "450 st.

In brief, Tanner, having been eighteen months in France, notwithstanding the variety of faces and company he met with, grew there also discontented with himself, and a continual impulse lay upon his spirit which he could not suppress, that he must return back again into England, for what reason he knew not ; whereupon he went on board a ship, and came safe into the port of London, where he had not remained scarce ten days before he heard of the news of Mr. Speccott's death within that time ; upon which intel ligence he forthwith posted from London to Thornbury in Devon, where she then resided in a mourning state, who received him in such joyful and welcome manner, that soon after the marriage was concluded betwixt them, by whom he had a great estate as aforesaid. TONKIN. St. Stephen's in Brannel is in the hundred of Powder, and hath to the west Ladock, to the north St. Dennis and Roche, to the east St. Austell and St. Mewan, to the south St. Probus and Creed. This church and the two following ones are dedicated to the famous protomartyr St. Ste phen, and have their different adjuncts, to distinguish them the one from the other. As it is a rectory, it is with St. Denis a daughter church to St. Michael Carhays, and valued, together with it, in the King's Book, at \u00a327. Os.

The rectory and vicarage have both the same patron, Tho mas Pitt, esq. (purchased by governor Pitt, from the heirs and assigns of John Tanner, esq.) ; and at this time the same incumbent, Mr. William Sutton ; who keeps a curate here, at present Mr. William Wood, junior, to serve this church and St. Denis, and makes it up to him (I speak it to his praise) the best curacy in this county. I shall begin with that great manor, from whence this parish hath its adjunct of distinction."], [465, "st. Stephen's in brannel. 451 THE MANOR OF BRANNEL. In Carew, (sol. 47), in the extent of Cornish acres, Bera nel is valued in thirty-six, the 12 Edw. I. I take this to be the same which is called in Doomsday Book Bernel, being one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made him Earl of Cornwall, WHITAKER. There is a very striking singularity in the nature of the present parish, which is but slightly or hardly noticed, byr Mr. Tonkin. It has been taken out of the parish of Car- hayes, and yet is actually distant from it. It is considered as one living with Carhayes, and yet has Probus and Creed in a first line, Tregony and Cuby in a second, Veryan and St. Ewe in a third, successively coming betwixt Carhayes and it. It is now held with St. Dennis as its daughter, and Carhayes as its mother, by a clergyman who holds Bocon- nock and Braddock as one church, together with it ; and who therefore stands forward to the curious eye, a most singular instance under the present forms of ecclesiastical law, of one man lawfully possessing five churches. But how is all this phenomenon in parochial formations to be accounted for ? It can be accounted for, I think, only in this manner. The manor of Carhayes was originally a royal one, I suppose. The house was therefore the seat occasionally of our Cornish kings. It was a seat peculiarly frequented, I also suppose, for the sake of the adjoining forest of Brannel. And the donation of Brannel by Wil- liam the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made him Earl of Cornwall, proves it to have been in the hands of the Crown at the time, and intimates it to have been a part of the Cornish demesnes originally. The lands that had belonged to the Cornish Crown, would cer- 2 g 2"], [466, "452 st. Stephen's in brannel. tainly be attached to the English, on the suppression of kings, and would assuredly be conferred on the Earldom of Cornwall, when the Kings were succeeded by Earls. In this condition of the parish and the forest, when the latter was annexed to the house, and so became a part of the former, any house that was raised in the forest for the temporary reception of the king, was necessarily considered to be as much in the parish as it was in the manor. WThen other houses were built, and a perpetual inhabitancy took place in them, a chapel was naturally erected for the participation of the inhabitants in divine offices, and the rector of Carhayes was called upon to officiate in person or by proxy at it ; in person while the king was there, by proxy when he was not. And he had the tithes of this newly cultivated part of the woodland, to repay him for his trouble or his expense. This accounts satisfactorily, I think, for the strange extension of the parochial compasses here. One leg was centered at the house of Carhayes, and therefore the other stretched over all the intermediate regions, and took its footing on the woodland of Brannel beyond. Nothing but the regality of both could have per- mitted such a vast stride as this. A Neptune may stalk from promontory to promontory, and a king may take a colossal step from Carhayes to Brannel. The very name too seems to concur with all this : called Bernel, Beranel, and Brannel, and originally belonging to the crown, it speaks the royal relationship at once ; Brenhin, or Brennin (W.) being a king, brennyn, brein, brenn (C.) royal, Bran being the Welsh name for the famous Brenhind (W.) and consequently brennol (C.) once, being kingly or royal. The house also at Carhayes has a royal kind of appearance with it, being built in the old style of grandeur round a court having a chapel, a wall, and all the uncomfortable vastness of a princely house. In this manner did St. Ste phen's go on to form a new kind of parish, by encroaching upon the royal woodland, and peopling these gloomy deserts. Considered at first as a chapelry to Carhayes, it"], [467, "st. Stephen's in brannel 453 was valued with it in 1291. It afterwards became paro chiated, and is valued as a distinct parish in the Valor of Henry VIIL ; but before the period of this second Valor, St. Dennis, which was wholly unknown in 1291, had risen upon St. Stephen's, just as St. Stephen's had risen upon Carhayes before. The daughter of Carhayes thus became a mother to St. Dennis ; and the wildest and remotest part of this antient forest of our kings coming to be peopled, and requiring a church for its inhabitants, St. Stephen's stands in the new Valor, accompanied with its chapel of St. Dennis. N. B. The only variation from the account here given, is what a sight of Pope Nicholas's Valor has suggested to me. There Caerhayes is not mentioned at all. The only church noticed is \" Ecclesia Sancti Stephani.\" This, there fore, included Caerhayes, then the larger included the smaller; and Caerhayes, which is little more (I believe) as a parish, than its own demense and park, (which, as royal demesne, I suppose, was not parochiated,) became annexed to St. Stephen's, when this was parochiated, \u2014 when, there fore, the royal relation of both had ceased ; and was so annexed in the Valor of 1291. June 16, 1794. THE EDITOR. This parish, like the other dedicated to St. Stephen, has a lofty tower placed, with the church, in a position commanding the adjacent country, which retains, however, much of its former character ; yet cultivation is gradually extending itself here, as in other wild tracts of Cornwall, through the medium of potatoe cultivation ; but if the mines should fail, or if the system itself goes to a great extent, we have a tremendous example before our eyes of the inevit able consequences resulting from this subdivision of pro perty. The church contains but one monument of any curiosity,"], [468, "454 st. Stephen's in brannel. and that is to the memory of Doctor Hugh Wolrige, a physician who died in 1652.

This is accompanied by an English inscription in quaint rhymes, from which it appears, that after quitting Cam bridge he went to complete his medical education at Breda, where the miasmata of that unhealthy country so injured his constitution as to close his days at the early period of thirty years. The epitaph states him to have been born at Penkevill, but the family were seated at Garlenick in Creed, and there, eighty years afterwards, John Wolrige, esq. is found among the subscribers to Martyn's Map of Cornwall, but deceased before the map appeared in 1748.

E. about a mile due N. from the church, would divide this parish into nearly two"], [469, "st. Stephen's in brannel. 455 equal parts, the northern parts consisting of granite, and the southern of schistose rocks, belonging to the porphyritic series. The granite stretches completely across the large central mass of this district, and contains many varieties. Next to the slate, the rock generally contains a considerable portion of shorl, which sometimes takes the place of the mica altogether; both of these kinds abound in large veins and courses of quartz and shorl rock. But the most abundant variety is that extensively decomposed into a white friable mass; of this substance the more compact and perfect parts are quarried, and exported under the name of China stone, whilst the earthy parts are washed to separate the fine argillaceous particles from the grains of quartz, and from other hard minerals with which they are mixed in their natural state. The water, rendered white like milk by this operation, is received in large pits, where the earthy part subsides, and then after being dried is sent to the potteries under the name of China clay. The manipulations which this substance undergoes during its preparation are simple, but very tedious ; and they afford employment to several hundred persons. The extent of this branch of com- merce is so great, that about seven thousand tons of clay, and five thousand tons of China stone are exported from Cornwall every year, of which by far the greater part is raised in this parish.

St. Stephen's near Launceston, is situated in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north Werrington, east the Tamer river, south Launceston, west St. Thomas. At the time of the Norman Conquest, this district (in the Domesday Book 1087,) was taxed under the jurisdiction of Lan-san, or Lan-sen, i. e. signifying a holy church or tem ple, though at that time this superior church had in this place a famous collegiate church dedicated to St. Stephen, consisting of secular priests, who might marry wives, founded and endowed by the Bishops of Bodman, and Earls of Cornwall, long before William the Conqueror's days. Reginald Fitz-Harry, base son of King Henry I. by Anne Corbet, created Earl of Cornwall by King Stephen, in the 5th year of his reign 1 140, was a great benefactor to this collegiate church ; and besides all that, endeavoured with all his power and interest with King Stephen to bring back the bishopric of Cornwall, transferred or translated to Kirton and Exeter, and fix the bishop's see and cathedral in this place and church of St. Stephen 1150, which Ro bert Warlewast, then Bishop of Exeter, opposed ; and in his first triennial visitation of the Cornish Diocese from Lan- whitton, came and visited this collegiate church, and sup pressed the order of secular priests conversing at large in the world, not tied to monastic life, and in the room of them brought in black monks or canons Augustine (see St. Anthony,) and converted this church and college into an abbey or priory of monks, by the name of the abbey or priory of St. Stephen's, whose governor was indifferently called the abbat and prior of St. Stephen's and Launceston. And to this purpose we read in the first inquisition into the value ol Cornish Benefices before-mentioned 1294,"], [471, "st. Stephen's near launceston. 457 these words : Prior de Lanceston precipit de Vicar' de Lankinhorne, xxvis. viiic?. Those monks before that inquisition, outof a covetous desire after wealth and riches, which they had obtained by gift or purchase, had wholly impropriated and turned into small vicarages the revenues of all such churches as to their abbey were annexed, and of which they were patrons. None of which churches' revenues, because wholly impro priated before the first inquisition, are rated or named in the Pope's or King's Books of First Fruits to this day.

The history relating to the more ancient ecclesiastical establishments in this parish does not seem to be very clear or distinct, although the general facts are well ascertained, and accord with the prevailing spirit of the times in which they occurred. William Warlewast, who held the see of Exeter about twenty years in the beginning of the twelfth century, sup-"], [472, "458 st. Stephen's near launceston. pressed a college of secular priests attached to St. Ste phen's Church, and founded a monastery of regular monks near the place where St. Thomfis\"s Church now stands. This house he endowed with the lands of the former col lege, and dedicated it to the same saint. It was consti tuted a priory of the order of St. Austin, and remained till the 'general dissolution. Mr. Lysons treats of the three parishes together, as Launceston and St. Thomas were originally portions of St. Stephen's ; and there is scarcely a doubt but that the Cornish having by some accident adopted the Greek name of the Protomartyr, called the church of Dunheved, Lan- Stephanon, or Stephen's Church, which easily glided into Lanston, written Launceston ; but in this, as in a thousand other instances, the common pronunciation approaches nearer to the true origin of a name, than the established orthography, as Excester much more corresponds with a camp on the Ex than Exeter. In St. Stephen's and in St. Thomas's, the parishioners nominate the perpetual curates ; and the latter parish is tithe free. The church of St. Stephen, although it cannot reach back nearly to the time of the college suppressed by Bishop WTarlewast, is yet on a scale superior to most others; and seated on an eminence with a lofty tower, it presents an object worthy of associating with the superb keep of Laun ceston Castle. There is an inscription within the Church, recording the munificence of Charles Cheney, Lord Viscount Newhaven, then Member for Newport, in re-building a part of the fabric, and probably in repairing the remainder according to the ill taste prevalent about the early part of the eighteenth century, so as to make the interior of the Church quite at variance with its exterior Gothic. The late Sir Jonathan Phillips inhabited a good house adjoining the street, which, with the attached property, has since been united to the great political influence of the place."], [473, "st. Stephen's near launceston. 459 The barton of Carnedon, an ancient possession of the Blighes, and afterwards of the Cloberrys, is now the pro perty of Thomas Bewes, Esq. ; and the barton of Tredi don, formerly a seat of a family bearing the same name, is now the residence of George- Francis-Collins Browne, Esq. who assumed the latter name on succeeding to the pro perty of his maternal grandfather, Mr. George Brown, of Bodmin. The modern history of this parish chiefly relates to the borough of Newport, and to its connection with the adja cent parish and seat of Werrington. Newport is little more than a street of Launceston, ex tending, with some interruption, to the northward. Its political importance must have grown out of the religious establishments. Various accounts are given by Browne Willis and others respecting the ancient constitution of this borough; but it had practically arrived at the state of a burgage tenure ; and two officers elected by a homage in the Lord's Court presided over the elections. They were denominated vian ders; but no such word occurs in any usual books of re ference. Werrington appears to have belonged entirely to the Abbey of Tavistock. At the time of the dissolution the manor paid of 141. 17s. lie?. And under another head is this entry : Worrington \u2014 Pensio de Ecclesia Sancti Martini \u00a32. 10s. The barton is known to have been one of the country residences appropriated to the Lord Abbat, to whom the mitre was granted by a papal bull in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and on whom King Henry the Eighth, in consi deration of the especial devotion which he bore towards the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Christ, and to St. Rumon, bestowed the privileges of a spiritual lord of Parliament in the fifth year of his reign. At Werrington the Lord Abbat had a deer park, which still remains in existence, his piscatories, and all the appendages suited to a feudal baron."], [474, "460 st. Stephen's near launceston. This property, together with all the other possessions of the monastery, passed by a grant from King Henry the Eighth, in the 31st year of his reign, to the family of Rus sel, with whom a considerable part of this immense largess still remains ; but Werrington was sold to a successor of the renowned circumnavigator Sir Francis Drake, who parted with it to Sir William Morris. This gentleman was the son of a clergyman from Wales, who had obtained a Canonry of Exeter; and he rose in station and in for tune by an early and close intimacy with General Monk, when that military adventurer sacrificed not only his poli tical associates, but the liberties of his country, even to the Petition of Rights, for the purpose of assuring his own aggrandisement, a misconduct which entailed on the nation all the doubtful and vacillating struggles in the reign of Charles the Second, and demanded for its final remedy the glorious Revolution of 1688. Werrington continued in Sir William Morris's family till the year 1775, when it was sold to Sir Hugh Smithson, created Duke of Northum berland in consequence of his marriage with Elizabeth only daughter of Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset, and of Elizabeth, sole daughter and heir of Josceline Percy, Earl of Northumberland. The Duke of Northumberland wishing to pursue the path of ambition which then lay open to any man of wealth, acquired with Werrington the commanding property at Newport and the influence at Launceston, and having made a similar acquisition lower down on the banks of the Tamar, he had the satisfaction of attaining the objects kept steadily in his view. Although the parish of Werrington is completely in Devonshire, and is believed to have formed a part of the original endowment of Tavistock Abbey by Ordgar Earl of Devonshire about the year 960 ; yet in spiritual matters it forms a part of the Archdeaconry of Cornwall.

Now, in order to raise this money, it occasioned the selling of the manor and lordship of Fentongollan, (See St. Michael Penkivell) though much dismembered before, to the value of five thousand pounds, by its former proprietors, John Hals and Carmenow, out of which the manor of Tregothnan was made, to Hugh Boscawen, esq. The articles of which bargain so distasted John Buller, esq. son of the said Francis, that to obstruct the sale of that lordship, which was his mother's lands, he forsook this kingdom, and went into France, where he remained for three years' space, saying, he would rather sell Shilling ham and Golden than Fentongallan (for at that time was extant upon it a spacious dwelling house, a tower of three or sour stories high, and a consecrated free chapel), which had been the seat of several famous families. But alas ! let man pretend or intend what he will, fate or destiny is unavoidable ; for by reason of his father's circum- stances, and to comply with his desire, at length he returned into England, and then was concluded with his father in a deed of sale of the premises by lease and release, for about the consideration of seven thousand pounds, to Hugh Bos cawen, esq. and executed the same, in presence of the writer of these lines, at Mowpass Passage, about the year ] 676, and soon after levied a fine for cognizance de droit to"], [479, "st. Stephen's near saltash. 465 dock the entail, and bar his heirs for ever. Afterwards, his father Mr. Buller, to raise the remainder of his said fine to the King, sold much other lands to make up the first payment thereof, and was forced to settle all his other estates in the hands of trustees, for raising the remainder, confining himself to an annuity of \u00a3180 during his life. Whereupon, having his liberty granted him by King Charles, he removed into Oxfordshire ; where, through trouble of mind, arising from this sad accident by a mali cious and perfidious priest, he grew delirious, or in a phrenzy, and died about the year 1679. Earth, in this parish, gave name and original to an old family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed de Earth, in which place Galfridus de Earth held by the tenure of knight service a knight's fee of land, 3 Henry IV.

And as most of the lands in this parish, if not all, are held from the Great Duchy Manor in it, I shall begin with THE MANOR OF TREMATON, called in Domesday Book Tremetone, \" ibi habet comes unum Castrum et Mercatum.\" It is called in the extent of Cornish acres, 20 (12) Edw. I. (Carew, sol. 48 b.) in 80. It is said (id. sol. 41 b.) that \" Aqua de Tamar, di. feod. in manu Regis de honore de Trematon ; \" from whence I guess that this manor was likewise in Henry IV.'s hands, this being in the 3d of his reign ; of which see what hath been said in Les keard ; and from its being called in Domesday Book Tre meton, and by Mr. Carew sometimes (ibid. sol. 41.) Tre merton, I guess that the original name was Tremerton, the great dwelling on the hill. THE EDITOR. The church and tower of this parish, rival in their posi tion and in their general appearance those of St. Stephen's near Launceston. Within the church are several monu ments to the Buffers and other ancient inhabitants. Among them is one to Jane, the wife of William Bond of Earth, esq. who died in the year 1 640. But the great curiosity of this parish is Trematon Castle, one of the fortified resi dences of the Earls of Cornwall, while they exercised feudal sovereignty within their dominions. Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin have given histories rather of the earls and of their adventures, than of the castle itself"], [481, "st. Stephen's near saltash. 467 and descriptions of its present appearance may be found in all the various writers on Cornwall : these have therefore been omitted. Mr. Edward King in his celebrated work, Munimenta Antiqua, or Observations on Antient Castles, vol. 111. after ascribing the most remote antiquity to Launceston Castle, which, for various reasons, he carries back beyond the Roman Invasion, especially indicates various points of distinction between the general construction of that fortress, and those of the Saxons and Normans. He then says, \"Trematon Castle, in the very same county of Cornwall, which may with good reason be concluded to have been built by Robert Earl of Moreton, is a true Norman struc ture. And tliere cannot be a greater contrast than there is between it and Launceston. Like Tunbridge Castle, it is placed, not on a high natural rock, but on an artificial mount, and is no less than sixty feet in diameter on the inside.\" See the views of it in Borlase's Antiquities, Second Edition, p. 354, Plate 31, and in Grose's Supplement to his Antiquities. There does not appear to be any real military history connected with this fortress. It proved an insecure place of refuge during the insurrection of 1549, raised by Hum phry Arundell and others in favour of the old religion. The castle was for some time occupied as subfeudatories by the Barons de Valletorta, so called, it is said, from the narrow winding valley, which descends from the castle wall towards the south. Roger de Valletort, Reginald, Ralph, Reginald, and Roger, appear to have possessed or occupied Trematon from about the year 1180, through nearly the whole of the next century. This fine ruin has within a few years received a most material injury, at least in the opinion of all antiquaries, by the building of a modern house in its Basse Court. Although the castle is fallen into decay, the privileges of the honor and manor to which this residence gave its name, 2 H 2"], [482, "468 st. Stephen's near saltash. still continue in full vigour, possessing as royalties the whole river Tamar, from some point above the castle to Plymouth Sound, with the coast below high-water mark on such parts of the opposite shore as are not held against them by immemorial usage, which makes it the more strange that Voltersholm (new-named Mount Edgecumbe by the first gentleman of that family who acquired it) should be poli tically considered as in Devonshire. Not far from Trematon Castle, and evidently an append age to it, is situated the Town of Saltash. After the entire change of manners and habits, of political institutions and of property, which have taken place since the feudal times, it is difficult now to conjecture why all the villages adjacent to baronial castles were favoured with municipal bodies and with corporate rights; institutions quite hostile to the gloomy and solitary grandeur of the chiefs by whom these privileges were bestowed. Perhaps they were found indispensable for the protection of persons necessary, in the rudest times, for the supply of articles of commerce, of manufacture, and even of subsistence, against the violence of retainers, who in those days supplied the want of a more regular force, always required in some shape or manner for the support of authority, and for the main tenance of civilized society. Saltash, under the name of Esse, received its first charter of incorporation, as it appears on the authority of Doctor Robert Brady, from a source which seems in modern times wholly infidequate to bestow the gift, since the offices of Duke, Earl, and Baron have long ce.ased to exist in Eng land, and these appellations, the shadows of a shade of times past by, are only known as matters of mere compliment given to the private gentlemen who now sit and vote in the Upper House of Parliament, by virtue of Letters Patent from the King. But when this charter was bestowed, the Baron de Valletorta, although the vassal of a vassal of the King of England, was yet a Prince within his small domain. This charter, confirmed by the Earl of Cornwall, and"], [483, "SALTASH. 469 others substantiated by the supreme chief, raised into a borough town sending members to Parliament, with a mayor, alderman, and common council, a song narrow street, descending to the river at such an inclination as to make it quite inaccessible to a loaded carriage. Modern improvements have however reached the Ville de Esse ; a good road is made round the south side of the town, and a large vessel denominated a floating bridge, propelled by steam acting on wheels connected with two strong chains extended across the bottom of the river, con veys passengers and carriages at all times, and independ ently of the tide, and even of the strongest winds, to the Devonshire side, where a road is now forming along the banks of the Tamar, with causeways, so as to convert a communication with Plymouth over three or four hills, into nearly a complete level way. The borough, which, in consequence of recent decisions of the House of Commons, had become one of close nomi nation, has disappeared in the great change of 1832. Of the principal seats in the parish, Shillingham con tinues to be the nominal residence of Mr. James Went worth Buller of Downs. Earth, the ancient seat of the Bonds, has passed through the Cornocks of Treworgy, in St. Clear, to the Rev. Lewis Marshall. The family of Bond is represented at present by Mr. Bond of Looe, and by the Bonds of Dorsetshire, who shared the patronage of Corse Castle with Mr. Bankes, and of whom the late Mr. Nathaniel Bond was a member of the Privy Council. Ince Castle has been purchased by Mr. Alexander Baring. The house is situated almost on an island in the river, and in the semblance of a fortress is flanked by a tower at each of the four angles, which have probably given rise to a tale of their having been constructed for a purpose in strict conformity with the Mahometan Law, but most hap pily at complete variance from our own."], [484, "470 st.

This was formerly a manor of large extent, but now strangely curtailed. Of late years it hath been the seat of the family of Mor ton; the last of which who lived here, John Morton, gent. who married the daughter of John Wilton of Dunveth, gent, was oddly outed of it (169 . . ) by Nicholas Pearce; who having gotten a great deal of money in Magda len Ball in Gluvias, settled it on his son Nicholas Pearce, lately dead, leaving by his wife, the daughter of Trewren, esq. of Trewardreva, one son Nicholas Pearce, a minor, who is the present lord of this manor.

The church and tower of this parish are handsome ob jects built of granite, which abounds throughout all that district. Mr. Lysons gives, as usual, on account of the ancient manors. The manor of Kennal, he says, belonged in the reign of Edward the Second to Matthew Penfern, after wards to the Carminows, one of whose coheiresses brought it to the Arundells of Lanherne ; by whom, in the year 1800, it was sold to three brothers of the name of Bath, who are the present proprietors.

The bartons of Treweek and Tresavren belonged to the family of Hawes, but now to Mr. James Brown. Tretheage, situated near the turnpike road leading from Truro to Helston, has a very pleasing appearance in the midst of a country almost bare of trees. About fifty or sixty years ago this place was the residence of a gentleman called Tincombe, who had been a practitioner of medicine, but retired to Tretheage, where either he or his father had built the present house. He married a Miss Kniverton of Tredreath in Lelant, but died without, children. Trevales has been for many years the residence of the late Mr. Thomas Reed, and of his ancestors ; who having been long what is termed good livers in the parish, advanced themselves by successful adventures in mines, and by con ducting a tin smelting house in the parish of Perran Arworthall. Mr. Thomas Reed never married, and de vised the greater part of his property to Mr. Hocker his near relation. Mr. Lysons says, the church of Stithians was given by Edward the Black Prince, to the abbey of Rewley near Oxford, in exchange for the manor of Nettlebed. It appears from the printed documents relative to that abbey, that Edmund Earl of Cornwall, in pursuance of his father's direction, Richard King of the Romans, founded Rewley Abbey in the year 1280. His charter, inter alia, has these words : Sciant pr\u00e6sentes et futuri quod nos Edmundus, clar\u00e6 memoriae domini Ricardi regis Alemanni\u00e6 filius, et Comes Cornubi\u00e6, dedimus, concessimus, et hac pr\u00e6senti carta nostra confirmavimus Deo et Ecclesi\u00e6 beat\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 de Regali-loco juxta Oxon. et Abbati inibi commoranti, et quindecim Monachis capellanis ordinis Cisterciensis sibi professis, pro anima Ricardi quondam Regis Alemanni\u00e6 patris nostri divina celebrantibus, et eorum successoribus"], [493, "5 STITHIANS. ibidem commorantibus, Deo servientibus et imperpetuum servituris, omnes terras et tenementa qu\u00e6 habuimus in North Oseneye juxta Oxon cum Advocatione Ecclesi\u00e6 de Sancta Wendrona et aliis pertinentiis suis in hundredo de Kerier in Cornubia.

Stoke Climsland is situate in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north Lezant, west Southill, east Calstock and the Tamar River, south Killington. This parish arid church take their name from the manor of Stow Climsland in this parish aforesaid, and by that name it was taxed in the Domesday Book 1087. It was first given by Orgar Duke of Devon, or Elphrida his lady, to Tavistock Abbey in Devon, which he had founded. (Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum, page 360.) After wards it became the possession of the Kings of England or Earls of Cornwall, and was by King Edward III. incorpo rated into the Duchy of Cornwall 1336. (See the charter under Lestwithiel.) And to remove an action at law out of the Court Leet of this Duchy or Stannary Manor, or any other in Devon, as I have elsewhere noted under Hel leston, the writ must be thus directed : \u2014 Gardiano Stannarum Devon et Cornubi\u00e6, Capitali Senescallo Ducatus sui Cornubi\u00e6, aut suo Deputat. ibidem.

And of this manor of Climsland, and the park of Cari Bollock in this parish are mention made in the Duke's Charter aforesaid. Now the modern name Cary-Bollock, I take to be only a corruption of Carow-Bollogk, female deer of a stag, probably kept here in the Duke's park, when brought out of the forest of Dartmoor. It appears from the ancient Survey of the Duchy of Cornwall in the Exchequer, tempore Edward III. (and"], [495, "STOKE CLIMSLAND. 7 Blount's Tenures, from thence also extracted page 107), that the old tenure of this Duchy Manor of Climsland or Clemsland, was villanage.

This being one of the ancient manors belonging to the Duke of Cornwall, and so settled by Edward the Third on his son Edward the Black Prince in the eleventh year of his reign, I shall say no more of it here, but come to the most remarkable places in it ; and first to CARY BULLOCK PARK. So Mr. Carew calls it (sol. 115), \" Carybullock,\" saith he \" some time a parke of the Duke's, but best brooking that name now it hath lost its qualitie, through exchanging deere for bullocks.\" Sir John Dodridge (History of Wal. and Corn. p. 84, &c.) calls it Kerry-bollock ; but what ifl should say the right name was Caer-bollick, and did sig nify the intrenched inclosure on the river ? \u2014 the situation would exactly answer this derivation ; but, since the writ ing of this, I find (Salmon's Survey of England, vol. II. p. 714) that Mr. Baxter, in Bull\u0153um or Buelt (according to Mr. Camden) in Brecknockshire, interprets it to be Caer-Bulack or \u25a0*** Principis Domus,\" the Prince's town or inclosure, which (if true) would suit very well with this. [This is a judicious application of one of Mr. Baxter's etymons to the present place; Bul\u0153um, as Baxter says the name is written in the superior copies of Ptolemy's Geography, Baxter thinks with Lhvvyd to be the modern Caer Phylli. Bel, he says, is properly a head, and figura tively a king. This makes Caer Bulack, \" quod ara est Regia.\" \" Certe,\" he adds, very usefully, \" vel ipsi novi nius in Montejromerica nostra Regione Domunculam anti- cs o qua Rhesi filii Theodori progenie nobilem ; \" ennobled by the birth of Rhys ap Tudor, \" vel hodie nominatam Caer Bulach, tanquam Principis dicatur domus.\" In proof of Mr. Baxter's seemingly unfounded interpretation of Bel, Bol, or Bui, a head and a king, we may observe the name of the sun Beal, in the Beal-tine of Cornwall and the Beil-tine of Ireland for the fires on May-day in"], [497, "STOKE CLIMSLAND. 9 honour of the sun ; Beal, Bil (I.) a mouth ; Bil (W.) the mouth of the vessel ; Bollog (I.) a shell, a scull, the top of the head; Fal (I.) a king or great personage; Folar (I.) to command; Folarthoir (I.) an emperor; Folladh (I.) government; Ffelaig (W.) a general, a captain, a leader; Belee, plural Belein (C.) a priest or priests ; Belek (A.) a priest; Pol-kil (C.) the hinder part of the head or the top of the neck; and in Belinus, Cunobelinus, and the pro montory Bolerium of the ancient Britons ; and Caer-Bu lack, as a royal house is called equally in Wales, would in the Cornish mode of pronunciation be Cerry-bullock, as Car-hayes is Carry-hayes at present. W.] Which since its being disparked by King Henry VIIL has been set out at lease to several gentlemen, and is now held by Sir John Coryton, of Newton, Bart. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons enumerates the manors ; the principal of which are the manor giving its name to the parish, part of the ancient possessions of the duchy of Cornw<ill, and the manor of Climsland Prior, extending into Linkinhorne, which formerly belonged to the priory of Launceston ; and after the general dissolution was given with many other manors forming the modern duchy in exchange for the honour and castle of Wallingford. Carrybullock, disparked by King Henry the Eighth, was held under a lease from the duchy by Mr. Weston Helyar. Mr. Lysons mentions other manors and bartons of no general interest, with the exception of Whiteford, on ac count of its late proprietor. Mr. John Call was one of those individuals of whom the country adjacent to the Tamar may be proud. It is understood that he was born on the Devonshire side of the river, and various tales are related of his first ad vancement in life; these are usually little worthy of atten-"], [498, "10 STOKE CLIMSLAND. tion, and are most frequently exaggerated from an innate love of the marvellous. Mr. Call having proceeded to India as an engineer, most eminently distinguished himself in that field, more ample than any recorded in history for the successful display of abilities, and active persevering industry; and where, for the first time since distinct nations have been brought into contact by the improvements of navigation and of commerce, the vanquished have become debtors to the more successful party for protection, for the administration of equal laws and of impartial justice, and for the introduction among the inhabitants -\u00bb\u00a3 the spirit of honour, the glory of modern Europe. Here Mr. Call having served his country, and justly acquired the legitimate rewards of fame and of ample fortune, retired to his native country, purchased Whiteford, which he converted into a handsome seat, and much other property in the neighbourhood. His active mind could not, however, remain unemployed ; he became a banker, a manufacturer of plate-glass, and a copper smelter. He served the office of Sheriff for Cornwall in the year 1771 ; afterwards represented Callington in Parliament, and was finally created a Baronet. It may be interesting to insert some miscellaneous in formation which thi. gentleman communicated to this Edi tor in Oct. 1798, while he resided for a few weeks or months at Marazion, and which was imperfectly noted at the time. He received the whole of his education as an engineer under Mr. Benjamin Robins, F.R.S.

He successfully defended Fort St. George at Madras; and in 1761 conducted the siege of Pondicherry, which ended in the capture of that place, the chief seat of the French power in India. Sir John Call also mentions as a curious circumstance, illustrative of the decisive effects pro duced by the well-directed fire of field artillery, that in a battle where he was present (query, was it Plassey?) a shell from an howitzer caused the explosion of a carriage containing gunpowder, which produced some confusion and disorder in the enemy's line ; the commander instantly ordered a charge, and the victory was decided. And he related another anecdote on a very different sub ject. That having with other amateurs of astronomy made preparations for observing the transit of Venus by con structing a temporary observatory on the flat roof of the government house at Madras, they waited with impatience after a long continuance of fine weather, for the important 3d of June 1761, when a most violent storm on the pre ceding night injured or destroyed their instruments so as to render any observation impossible ; and, what added to their mortification and disappointment, a long continuance of fine weather succeeded this tempest.

The southern part of this parish includes the whole of the granite of Kit Hill, which is for the most part of the coarse-grained crystalline variety so common in Cornwall. Proceeding northward, the rest of the parish is found to belong to the schistose rocks ; those next to the granite are felspathic, and contain beds of porphyry, but those more remote, which form the greater part, must be referred to the calcareous series. STRATTON. HALS. Stratton is now situate in the hundred from thence denominated Stratton, (formerly Major Trigshire Cantred) and hath upon the north Powghill, east Lancells, south Marhamchurch, west Bude Bay and the Channel. As for the name, after the Saxon, it is compounded of Strat-ton, i. e. street or highway town, a lane or public road, derived perhaps from the Latin strata, a street or Roman highway ; and by this name of Stratton, it is taxed in the Domesday Book 1087.

The town of Stratton is privileged with a weekly market on Tuesdays, and Fairs annually on the 8th of May, 28th of October, and 30th of November. Thurlebere, Thurle-ber, bir, in this parish, was another district taxed in the Domesday Book 1087, from whence was denominated an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed De Thurlebere, or whurle-ber; i. e. cast, whirle, twine, the spit, short spear, dart, pike, lance or broach, for so the terminative particle ber, bere, bir, indifferently signifies. See Floyd upon Obelus. In this place John de Thurle bere held by the tenure of knight's service, twenty pounds per annum in lands, tempore Edward HI. and John de Cobham had likewise in it by the same tenure the third part of a knight's fee. (Survey of Cornwall, page 40 and 52.) One of those Thurleberes married the daughter and heir of Thomas de Waunford, Lord of Ebbingford, alias Efford in Bude Bay, and afterwards made it the place of their residence, tempore Henry V. till at length the daugh ter and heir of those Thurleberes was married to Arundell of Trerice, tempore Edward IV. whose posterity are now in possession thereof. Near this town of Stratton, in a field called there happened on Tuesday the 16th of May 1643, a sore and bloody battle between the army or soldiers of King Charles I. under conduct of his general Sir Ralph Hopton, knight, and Major-General Chudleigh, Com mander of the Parliament Forces in those parts; where, after a sharp contest from five of the clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, the fight or success continued doubtful : so that Sir Bevill Grenvill, knight, was unhorsed, and his troop put into disorder by Chudleigh's men ; and"], [502, "14 STRATTON. the king's party had been totally overthrown had not Sir John Berkeley with great courage and conduct led up the musketeers he commanded to their seasonable assistance, maintaining the charge with that stoutness, that the Par liament army, after the loss of about three hundred soldiers, gave ground, and Chudleigh was taken prisoner, with seven teen hundred more of his party. The king's army having sustained the loss of about two hundred persons, had the plunder of the field, wherein they found seventeen brass pieces of ordinance, seventy barrels of powder, three thou sand arms, with ammunition, provision, and biscuit, propor tionable. The country people hereabout will tell you, that the field aforesaid where this battle was sought, being afterwards tilled to barley, produced sixty bushels of corn, Winchester measure, in every acre (See St. Sennan) ; the fertility whereof is ascribed to the virtue the lands received from the blood of slain men and horses, and the trampling of their feet in this battle. For this victory, Sir Ralph Hopton, knight of the Bath, was by Letters Patent dated at Oxford, 4th Septem- ber, 19 Charles I. by him created Baron Hopton of Strat- ton ; but he dying without issue at Bruges in Flanders, King Charles the Second, in the 12th year of his reign, conferred that honorary title of Straton, upon Sir John John Berkeley aforesaid (younger son of Sir Maurice Barkley of Bruton in Somerset) who also was one of the four managers of martial affairs in Cornwall for King Charles I. together with the Lord Mohun, Sir Ralph Hopton aforesaid, and Colonel Ashburnham ; he also reduced Exeter, and was made governor thereof, and gave for his arms in a field Ruby a chevron Ermine, between ten crosses pattee Pearl, six in chief, and four in base. The ancestor of this Sir Ralph Hopton, knight, came out of France or Normandy, a soldier or huntsman under William the Conqueror 1066, by the name of the Norman"], [503, "15 STRATTON. Hunter, to whcm he gave Hopton in the Hole in the county of Salop, (from whence afterwards he was denominated De Hopton,) which he conveyed to him and his heirs, and failing the remainder, to the crown. Sir William de Mohun, one of the founders of the Abbey of Newham in Devon, 30th Henry III. gave to the same the bailiwick of the hundred of Axminster, and also the manor of Norton, with the hundred and bailiwick of Major Trigshire, now Stratton in Cornwall. (See Prince's Worthies of Devon.) After the dissolution of Newham Abbey, 26 Henry VIIL it fell to the crown, from whence the present titles of those bailiwicks are derived. TONKIN. Stratton is in the hundred of the same name, and is bounded to the west by the north or Severn channel and Poughill, to the north by Kilkhampton, to the east by the river Tamar, to the south by Lancells, Marhamchurch, and Poundstock. As for the name, it is no other than the street town, from its consisting chiefly of one street, and being a great thoroughfare, but more probably from a Roman Way. [from the Roman stratum or street certainly, on which it lies. W.] In anno 1291, 20 Edward I. the rectory was valued (Tax.

In Domesday Book Stratone was one of the manors given by William the Conqueror to his half-brother Robert Earl of Morton, when he made him Earl of Cornwall. In the extent of Cornish acres, 12 Edward I. (Carew,"], [504, "16 STRATTON. fol. 48), it is valued in 21. In 3 of Henry IV. (Id. sol. 40 b.] Ranulph de Albo Monasterio ( Whitchurch) [a family in this parish, formerly called Blancminster] held here one kniffht's fee. THE EDITOR. Stratton is a neat although a small town. Before the great roads were made through the middle of the county along the central ridge and above the formation of deep valleys, a northern entrance into Cornwall passed through this town. Mr. Lysons says, that the manors of Stratton and Binomy belonged at an early period to an ancient family called in various records De Albo Monasterio, or Blanch minster and Whitminster. The property passed by an heiress to the family of Hiwis; and Emmeline the heiress of Hiwis, married first, Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, who lost his life through popular violence in the year 1388 ; and secondly, Sir John Coles hill. Sir John Coleshill, son of the above, was killed at the battle of Agincourt in 1415, leaving an infant son; after whose death in 1483 the large estates of this family passed by a female heir to a younger branch of the Arundells, and were afterwards divided among its numerous representa tives. The manors of Binomy and Stratton having been pur chased by the Grenvilles, have descended to Lord Carteret. The manor of Efford or Ebbingford, belonged at an early period to the Waumfords or Waunfords, from whom it passed by a coheiress to the Durants, and from them by an heiress to the Arundells of Trerice, from whom it is derived to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland of Killerton. The church and tower are fine specimens of the style of architecture prevalent throughout the West of England. There are also several monuments ; and Mr. Lysons quotes"], [505, "17 STRATTON. from the register, the b.iptism and death of Elizabeth Cornish, who lived between these two dates, 1 13 years 4 months and 13 days. She was baptized in Oct. 1578, and was buried March the 10th, 1691. The great tithes and the manor denominated Sanctuary, or Sentery, as was usual with such professions, belonged to the Priory of Launceston. After the dissolution of monas teries, this manor carrying with it the advowson of the vicarage, was annexed to the Duchy of Cornwall, with various other lands, in exchange for the honour .and castle of Wallingford. The great tithes were granted to the family of Wadder, but they have since been sold in parcels. The place of most importance in this parish after the town, is Bude. This place has always given some shelter for boats, and afforded sand for manure. It has within about twenty years received most essential improvement. A pier or jetty has been built out into the seii, and a canal with inclined planes has been made for the convey ance of coal and merchandise into the country, and for bringing down slate and the produce of land ; but .above all, for supplying sand as a manure. The sand at this place consists entirely of powdered shells, as it does along the whole north coast of Cornwall, and it is sound to be so efficacious for imparting fertility to clay lands, that it is frequently conveyed in wheel carriages to so great a dis tance from the coast, as to require the draft cattle remain ing out a night. The boats used on this coast are formed like boxes, having within each side a closed trough containing two wheels, which project a very little beyond the lower surface. These wheels are consequently no impediment to the boats floating on the water, but they enable them to ascend or to descend the inclined planes with the facility of other carriages. See a Treatise on the Improvement of Canal Navigation, by R. Fulton, 1 vol. 4to, London, 1796, p. 32, where this plan is suggested perhaps for the first time. vol. iv. c"], [506, "18 STRATTON. Bude is also become a place of resort for sea bathing ; and several houses for the accommodation of strangers have been built by Sir Thomas Acland, so that it has acquired the well-known appellation of a watering place. The Editor having omitted through inadvertence to notice in the adjoining parish of Launcels a gentleman one of the most respectable in the north-eastern part of Cornwall, hopes that he may be excused for inserting his name here. Launcells House, a modern building on the spot where formerly stood the residence of the Chamonds, is the seat of George Boughton Kingdon, esq. respected by every one who has the honour cf his acquaintance, for scientific and literary acquirements, and esteemed as a benefactor to his neighbourhood in the characters of a magistrate and of a worthy country gentleman. An instance of longevity has been given in the parish of Stratton, and an occurrence has been stated to the Editor, which proves that Launcells participates in the general healthiness of that district. It seems the identical six men who rang the bells in Launcells tower on the Coronation of King George the Third, rang them also on the day of his jubilee, having continued the parish ringers during all that time. Their names are recorded in the parish, and may there sore be inserted here. John Lyle, Henry Cadd, Richard Venning, John Ham, John Allin, Richard Hayman. And of these, John Lyle rang at the accession of King George the Fourth, and of his present Majesty King Wil liam the Fourth, being then in his ninety-sixth year : but all are now gathered to their fathers. And here, as appertaining more to the general character of the country than to any particular parish, in reference to the terrific cliff's which surround this coast, it may be proper to state a fact communicated by Mr. Kingdon ; that, from actual measurement taken by himself, Hennacleve cliff on Westcot Down, in the parish of Moorwinstow, is 430 feet above the level of the beach."], [507, "STRATTON. 19 Stratton measures 2300 statute acres.

This parish, like the adjoining one of Kilkhampton, is composed of compact and of schistose varieties of dunstone, occasionally interspersed with beds of calcareous schist and limestone. TALLAND. HALS. Talland is situate in the hundred of West, and hath upon the north Pelynt, east the haven or harbour of Looe, south the British Channel, west Lansallas.

For the etymology of Looe, see East Looe. This manor of borough of Porthbyan, as I am informed, was heretofore villanage tenure, and pertained to the Bodrigans. In this town of West Looe, was born Charles Wager, as I am informed, son of Wager ; who, being placed an apprentice at sea, grew so expert in navigation and the mathematics, that he became a great master in that art; and being after in the sea fight between Queen Anne and the French and Spaniards, he behaved himself so well in his valour and conduct, though to the loss of one of his arms, that by Queen Anne or King George he was afterwards knighted, and preferred, not only to the com mand of a third-rate frigate, but made Admiral of the Red Squadron of Men of War, for him and his son King George the Second, in the Baltic Sea and British Channel 1729. In this parish stands the barton and manor of Killygarth.

TONKIN AND WHITAKER, Talland is in the hundred of West, and is bounded to the west by Launcells, to the north by Pelynt, to the east by Looe river, and to the south by the British Channel. This is a vicarage, not valued in the King's Book; but in anno 1291, 20 Edward I. it was valued, the rectory (Tax. Benef.) at \u00a38, it having been appropriated to Launceston Priory ; and the vicarage at 40s. The patronage is in Archdeacon Kendall, and the incumbent Mr. Doidge. Mr. Thomas Kendall had a younger brother, Colonel James Kendall, who was Governor of Barbadoes in , one of the lords of the Admiralty under Queen Anne, and a member of Parliament in several Parliaments : he died suddenly, unmarried, July the 10th, 1708, at his house in London, very rich, and left a natural son by Mrs. Colliton, who now goes by the name of Kendall. Under Killygarth is Porth-Para, vulgo Polpera, id est, the sandy port. \" A little to the eastwards,\" saith Carew, (sol. 131 b.) \"from Killygarth, the poor harbour and village of Polpera coucheth between two steep hills : \" [from which circumstance, as I know of no word similar to para in the Cornish, and signifying sand in English, I might more aptly take the name to be (as Carew writes, and as usage sounds it) pol-pera, pol-poran, the close or strait pool.

The manor by the name of Tallan, in the extent of Corn ish acres, 12 Edward I. is valued in six. (Carew, sol. 49.) [Here let me just note what Mr. Tonkin has omitted, the etymology of the name of the parish, and of the manor. Written originally Tallan, and gaining only the final T. by vicious pronunciation, the manor and the parish derive their name apparently from the church ; and this takes its appellation from its site, I apprehend, being seated upon the high bold shore of the channel, and so being called Tal-Lan, the high church or the church upon a high posi tion ; just as Tal-ar (C.) signifies a high land or headland, and as a high rock in St. Allen is called Tal-Carne.

Mr. Bond has given so good and ample an account of this parish in his Topographical and Historical Sketches of East and West Looe, 1 vol. 8vo. printed by Nichols, 25, Parliament Street, Westminster, 1823, that the whole which is addative to Hals and Tonkin, is here inserted. West Looe is situated in the parish of Talland, within which parish is a hamlet called Lemain, and part of West Looe lies in this hamlet. On the barton of Portlooe in the parish of Talland, just opposite Looe Island, was a cell of Benedictine Monks, called Lammana, subject to the Abbey of Glastonbury, to which the site appears to have been given by the ancestors of Hastulus de Solenny ; there are some remains of the chapel still in existence. I measured this chapel on the 13th of April 1815, and found it, within the walls, about forty-seven feet long by twenty-four wide. About three or four hundred yards to the eastward of the chapel are the remains of some antient building, perhaps that in which the monks dwelt. The remains of the eastern end wall thereof, at present eight or ten feet high, have two very narrow windows or openings, still in being. The situation of this chapel and house is very pleasant; they lie in a sort of natural amphitheatre, sheltered from the north winds by high land."], [514, "26 TALLAND. In Hearne's Appendix to Adam de Domerham, is a grant of Hastulus de Solenny, confirming the Island of St. Michael de Lammana (most probably that of St. George opposite Looe) to the Monks of Glastonbury ; a grant of Roger Fitzwilliam quitting claim to the lands of Lammana, which he held for life under the Church of Glastonbury (reserving the house which Mabil his sister occupied), and one of Richard Earl of Cornwall, granting the Monks a licence to farm out the church, and the Island of Lam mana.

Between the main land and Looe Island stands a rock, higher than the surrounding ones, which is called Midmain or Magmain. Small vessels frequently pass between the island and the main land, when the tide is in. An imaginary line drawn from Looe Island westward, to a high rock called horestone or orestone, about a mile distant, would form the outer boundary of a piece of water called Port nadler Bay; from whence the name is derived I know not. CORPORATION. Queen Elizabeth incorporated West Looe 14th February 1574, in the sixteenth year of her reign, by the name of Mayor and Burgesses of the Borough of Portbyhan, other wise West Looe, in the county of Cornwall. Twelve chief burgesses were appointed by this charter. The mayor is elected from the Chief Burgesses, by their votes and the votes of the Free Burgesses, on Michaelmas-day annually, between nine and twelve of the clock in the forenoon, and then sworn into office. The mayor is also a Justice of the Peace, as is likewise the steward. The mayor has no power"], [517, "TALLAND. 29 to appoint a deputy. The steward, however, has such an authority; but his deputy is not a Justice of the Peace. WEST LOOE DOWN. \u2014 GIANT'S HEDGE OR MOUND. Just above the houses (the intermediate space filled up with gardens and orchards) is a common or down, called West Looe Down, of near a hundred acres, on which are the remains of a mound of earth that runs many miles across the country, and is noticed by Borlase, who, from its extent and other circumstances, supposed it to be a Roman work. His account of it as follows : \" That the Romans had ways in the eastern parts of the county about Loo and Lostwithiel, the following antient work, shewn me by the Rev. Mr. Howell, Rector of Lanreath (June 25 and 26, 1756), will abundantly confirm. It is called the Giant's Hedge, a large mound, which reaches from the valley in which the Boroughs of East and West Looe are situated, to Leryn, on the river Fowey. It is first visible on West Looe Down, about two hundred paces above the Mills ; whence it runs to Kilminarth Woods ; from and through them to Trelawn Wood, about three hundred paces above Trelawn Mill ; then through Little Larnick to the barton of Hall, in which there are two cir cular encampments, about four hundred paces to the north of it ; thence quite through the said barton, making the northern boundary of fields to the glebe of Pelynt Vicarage, called Furze Park ; then cross the barton of Tregarrick ; and thence, through the north grounds of Tresassen and Polventon, to the glebe lands of the rectory of Lanreath, where I measured it seven feet high and twenty feet wide at a medium; thence it stretches through the tenement of Wyllacombe to Trebant Water; whence it proceeds, through the barton of Longunnet and some small tene ments, to Leryn; from which there is a fair dry down, called St. Winnow Down, leading north along to Lostwi thiel. This risbank, or mound, ranges up hill and down"], [518, "30 TALLAND. hill indifferently ; has no visible ditch continued on any brow of a hill, as intrenchments always have ; there is no hollow, or foss, on one side more than the other ; it is about seven miles long, and tends straight from Looe to Leryn Creek, in the direct line from Looe to Lostwithiel. By all these properties, its height and breadth, in wanting the fosses of fortification, its straightness and length, the gran- deur of the design, and the labour of execution, I judge that it can be \"nothing less than a Roman work. In this supposition I am the more confirmed, first, because several Roman coins have been found on the banks of Fowey river (as see \" Antiquities of Cornwall,\" p. 282), and, as I have been informed, also in the run of this notable work ; se- condly, by its tendency to the first ford over the navigable river of Fowey ; for it must be observed that the Romans, thoroughly sensible of the delays and hazards of crossing friths and arms of the sea, and the danger of bridges getting into the possession of the natives, were equally averse both to bridges and passing large rivers ; they had therefore in constant view the nearest and most commodious fords of rivers, and directed their roads accordingly. Now near Leryn Creek, where the work ends, there is a ford, and no where below is the river Fowey fordable; which plainly accounts for their conveying this road so high up the coun- try, that it might at once convey their troops towards their station at Lostwithiel, and afford them a safe passage over the river Fowey into the western parts, through Grampont and Truro.\" Borlase also, in his Natural History, says, \" There are the remains of a causey between Liskeard and Looe, near Polgover, the seat of Mr. Mayow, which, as well as the cross road from Dulo to Hessenford, vulgar tradition makes to be Roman.\" This causey I have never been able to find out. The above-mentioned mound is first visible directly above Looe bridge ; so that, if a line was drawn west, as"], [519, "31 TALLAND. the bridge tends, it would come to it at the head of a field called Bridgend meadow, where a small orchard is planted. There is a very visible ditch all along West Looe Down to the north of the rampart. On the barton of Hall, how ever, the ditch is to the south of the rampart. This ram part on the barton of Hall is at least fifteen feet high and about twenty feet thick at the base. About four hundred paces north of it, as Borlase says, there are two apparently (though not perfectly, as I was informed by Captain Daw son, who assisted in taking the Trigonometrical Survey, under Colonel Mudge) circular encampments, situated in a field called Berry Park. Berry Park contains about eighteen acres, and may be termed a tongue of land. It has a valley on each side, and also at the bottom. Across the isthmus, if I may so term it, of this tongue of Land, runs the mound, protecting that part of the field which the val leys do not extend to. The circles (or rings, as they are now called by the tenant) consist of one entire circle of about 122 paces diameter, surrounded with a rampart, ditch, and breast-work ; the height of which rampart, from the bottom of the ditch, is, I imagine, upwards of fifteen feet, and must originally have been much higher. This circle has but one gateway into it, which is guarded by mounds without ditches, running upwards of fifty feet into the circle. The part of this circle where the gateway is, is surrounded by about three fourths of another circle, whose sweep, had it been continued, would have intersected the inner circle ; but the southern part of this outermost circle, when it comes within twenty or thirty feet of the inner, falls into the segment of another circle, which runs parallel to the inner circle, leaving a platform of about fifty feet breadth between the two ditches, and surrounding about a third part of the inner circle. From the gateway of the inner to the opposite point of the outward circle, is about 144 paces, which may be about three fourths of the diameter. The outer circle has a similar rampart, ditch, and breast-work with the inner circle, and one gateway,"], [520, "32 TALLAND. which is not quite opposite that of the former. These circles command very fine prospects both of land and sea. Rame Head and the entrance into Plymouth are visible from Berry Park. You can see these circles from Bin down Hill with the naked eye; and from the elevation of that hill you look down on them so as to see their areas. In a field a short distance south-west of Pelynt church town, and about half a mile in a direct line from the said circles, are many barrows. The field in which they are, is I believe, called the The Five Barrows. At the bottom of this field is a highway, leading from Pelynt Church-town to the Fowey road. In this highway, just at the bottom of the said field, a few years since, a grave was discovered by some men mending the highway. It was formed by four stones on their edges, and a covering stone. In this kest vaen was an urn, with burnt ashes in it: and round the urn were piled, in a regular manner, the unburnt remains of human bones. I went to Pelynt purposely to see this curiosity, but found the grave had been filled up, and its contents buried. The urn was described to me by a man who saw it as having ornaments of flowers and leaves on its outside, and that it fell into sheards when touched. I could not learn that any coin or other thing was found in the urn or grave ; indeed, I fancy there was a lack of curiosity in all concerned. Part of the mound on West Looe Down has been from time to time dug down, to obtain earth for building and plastering. I have several times desired the labourers, in case of their finding any coin or other thing curious, to preserve it; but have never heard of any thing being found of late years. A celt (commonly called in this neighbour hood a thunderbolt*) was some years ago sound on this Down ; and it was given by the late Mr. Bawden, of Looe, * The common people believe these celts to be produced by thunder, and thrown down from the clouds ; and that they shew what weather will ensue by changing their colour."], [521, "TALLAND. 33 to Mr. James, of St. Kevern. I have a celt, made of a hard black stone, which was found in pulling down an old house at East Looe a few years since : it is between six and seven inches long, and very perfect. I lately saw some like it in shape and stone, but not so large, in the British Museum. I also remember seeing a celt that was sound, about thirty years ago, at Kilminarth, near the ruin of the said mound : about which time a gold chain and several instruments of brass were found in a decayed hedge, or side of a highway, near Little Larnic, by an apprentice girl. Her mistress described them to me as being somewhat like hatchets, and said \" she believed they were things which the warriors used in antient times.\" I applied to the mistress, in hopes of getting a sight of them; but her apprentice had sold them to a buyer of old brass. The hedge formed one side of the high road, not far from the said mound. The apprentice told me that the gold chain was about a foot and a half in length \u2014 that when she found it, not thinking it was gold, she tied it to the end of a stick, and made a sort of whip of it to drive home the cows. She some time after discovered that it was gold, and kept it by her for several years, when she gave it to her brother, who sold it to a Mr. Patrick, a jeweller at Dock, for three pounds. The brother told me that Mr. Patrick said it was Corsican gold ; and he (the brother) also told me that he well remembered the brass instruments, and that some of them were like the tops of spontoons. POLVELLAN. On West Looe Down the late John Lemon, esq. (M.P. for Truro, and who died April 5, 1814), about the year 1787 erected a small but extremely neat house in the cot tage style, and inclosed some ground round it by virtue of a grant from the Corporation. He gave it the name of Polvellan, and laid it out with great taste. Pol, in Cornish, VOL. IV. D"], [522, "34 TALLAND. signifies a Fool, and Vellan a Mill ; and below the house are a mill and pool, inclosed by a stone wall of about half a mile sweep, in a circular direction. I cannot describe the contrivance and use of this pool better than in the words of Mr. Carew, in his \" Survey of Cornwall.\" \u2014 \"Amongst other commodities afforded by the sea, the inhabitants make use of divers his creekes for grist mills, by thwarting a banke from side to side, in which a flood-gate is placed, with two leaves ; these the flowing tide openeth, and, after full sea, the weight of the ebb closeth fast, which no other force can doe ; and so the imprisoned water payeth the ransome of driving an under shoote wheel for his enlargement.\" I apprehend the mill and pool-wall were built by one of the Arundells of Tremodart, in Duloe parish. The wall is about six or eight feet high, and almost broad enough for a coach to pass over it, and must have cost a great deal of money. It appears by a deed which I have seen, that the Mayor and Burgesses of West Looe, on the 30th of May, in the twelfth year of the reign of James the First (1614), granted all that parcel, quantity of ground, oze, or water, now surrounded by the said mill pool-wall, to Thomas Arundell, of Tremodart, in the parish of Duloe, esq. for 500 years, from thence next ensuing; that afterwards the said Thomas Arundell built a mill house, and four grist-mills, and other houses, and also the mill-pool-wall. On November 3, 1648, the said Thomas Arundell made his will ; and I believe the mills and mill pool-wall were built by him before he made his will. Af terwards this term in these premises were assigned over by the Arundells (father and son) and one Drew (perhaps a mortgagee) to Sir Jonathan Trelawny, for the remainder of the said term. I am apprehensive, however, that there was a mill at this place previous to the aforesaid grant. INCLOSURE OF THE DOWN DESIRABLE. It is much to be regretted that West Looe Down is not wholly inclosed ; the soil is very good, as is apparent from"], [523, "35 TALLAND. the fine state of the grounds of Polvellan. The Looes being bounded by the sea on one side, and by rivers and woods on the other, arable land is much wanted. The ob- jection raised against this inclosure is, that the poor of West Looe would be deprived of gathering furze and fern for firing. But does not the labour wasted and cloaths worn out in gathering this fuel more than counteract the gain ? If an inclosure were to be made, in a year or two the hedges would produce greater quantity and more substan- tial fuel than can now be obtained. The Down belongs to the Corporation ; but various tenants of houses and fields claim a right of putting what is called Breaths (cattle), some more, some less, to depasture on it. To such as are entitled to put breaths on this, common allotments should be made in proportion to the number of breaths they are entitled to ; and an allotment to the poor might be made in lieu of their claim (if it is a legal one) to take furze and ferns for firing. The many advantages which would arise to the poor in particular from an inclosure, should be con- sidered. Exclusive of the numerous productions which would follow, labour would be demanded, hedges must be made, manure procured, land ploughed, corn tilled, cut, &c. &c. &c. Milk, potatoes, &c. &c. would be obtained at a much more moderate price than at present; and, no doubt, the poor rate would soon find the beneficial effect of an inclosure. In short, the advantages arising herefrom would be very great; and I sincerely hope the prejudices of the interested will soon be done away, and that the com- moners will get an Inclosure Act passed. Formerly the Corporation used to let out certain parts of this Down for tillage. There are several memorandums of such lets in the Town Books. In 1621 that part of West Looe Down which lieth on the west part of the Homer Well, was let to rent, for two crops, at 6s. 8c?. per acre. d 2"], [524, "36 TALLAND. TRADE. Formerly a pretty considerable trade was carried on at Looe, and many ships belonging to this port used to go from thence to France, Spain, and up the Straits, &c. Even so late as the beginning of the last century there were several ships kept here, principally employed in foreign voyages ; but, for seventy or eighty years last past, few, if any, have been so employed. Tallan Church is most romantic in its situation ; it con tains a curious monument to one of the Bevilles. Pol- benro, divided between this parish and Lansallos, affords picturesque scenery superior to any on the southern coast of Cornwall ; and the whole road from Fowey to Looe, by Polruan, Lansallas, Polperro, and Talland, will amply compensate the fatigue of climbing hills, and descending into deep vales, by the singular and striking prospects varied at every point. The manor of Killigarth belonged at an early period to the family of Kilgat, evidently implying some relation be tween the names. Kilmenawth, or Kilmenorth, formed a part of the large possessions belonging to Lord Chief Justice Trevilian, who was murdered under some forms of law in the year 1388, the 11th year of Richard the Second. This place was the residence of Admiral Sir Charles Wager. The hamlet of Lemain or Lammana, which seems to have included a considerable portion of the parish with the island, must have been of importance, since a record exists, which states a division of the monastic property of Glas tonbury, between the bishop and his chapter on one part, and the monks on the other, when about the year 1200, Pope Innocent the Third removed the see of Wells to that place. The words are, \" De Prioratibus quoque ad Glastonien sem Ecclesiam pertinentibus, ita ordinatum est. Ut"], [525, "37 TALLAND. Prioratus de Hibernia ad ordinationem Episcopi ; Prioratus vero de Basselake et de Lamana ad ordinationem conventus pertineant.\" Portlooe appears to have been the principal estate of the hamlet, but no traditions are extant about its antiquity. It belonged about the middle of the last century to Mr. John Hoskin of East Looe, probably by purchase ; he left an only daughter, who married first Mr. Edward Buller, a brother of the Judge. This gentleman had been educated in Holland according to the customs of those times, with a view to trade, which however he never pursued, but settled on his wife's barton of Portlooe, and died there, leaving several children. Mrs. Buller, nevertheless, married secondly Mr. Thomas Escott, an officer in the Cornwall Militia. The island has probably passed through different hands since the dissolution of Glastonbury Abbey. It recently belonged to the family of Mayow, by whom it was sold for a very trifling consideration, to Sir W'illiam Trelawney, afterwards Governor of Jamaica. Pol-Vellan, (the Mill Pool,) created and named by the late Colonel John Leman, is an exquisite specimen of that gentleman's taste. The editor remembers it a wild uncultivated uninclosed common, adjacent to the tide Mill. About twenty years after the commencement of deco rations, he placed the following inscription where a rill of water formed a small cascade under the shelter of some shrubs, and of three or sour trees which had stood on the Down.

Halvethus Malivery held half of a knight's fee here. THE EDITOR, Mr. Lysons gives the descents of property in this parish. He says the manor of North Tamarton was given by Roger de Valletort to Richard Earl of Cornwall, and that Roger Earl of Cornwall gave it to Gervase de Har ningate. It was afterwards in the Carminows. In 1620 it belonged to Tristram Arscott, esq. and afterwards to the Rolles, of whom it was purchased by the late Sir John Call of Whiteford. The manor of Hornacot or Homingcote belonged at an early period to a family of that name ; in 1620 it was pos sessed by Sir Charles Howard, in right of his wife, the daughter of Sir John Fitz of Fitzford near Tavistock, and was afterwards in the Courtenays ; and finally passed from them by purchase to the late Mr. George Browne of Bodmin. Ogbere, called by Norden Ugbere, was in his time the seat of William Lovice, and had been the residence of Leonard Lovice, probably the father or grandfather of William, and is stated, by a monumental inscription still extant in the church, to have been Receiver-general of the Duchy Revenues for Queen Elizabeth.

Mr. Lysons gives in this parish, as in every other, the descents and sales of lands. The manor of Tregordock, formerly in the Mohuns, passed in the general purchase to Mr. Pitt. Mr. Agar, the Molesworth family, and Mr. Sandys of St. Minver, have lands in this parish ; and Mr. Treva-"], [533, "45 ST. TEATH, nion, of Carhayes, possesses in this parish either the whole or a part of Drillavale or Dinnavale quarry, producing the finest and most durable roofing slate of all that dis trict ; and said by Bishop Watson, in his Chemistry, to be the very best in England. Treveares was for a long time the residence of a family which began to rise about a century ago into considerable opulence. Mr. Phillipps, of this place, settled as an at torney in Camelford; and availing himself of the valuable privileges possessed by that place, acquired a fortune. He had three sons. The eldest son, Charles Phillipps, married one of the coheiresses of the Longs of Penhele, and, not having any family, transmitted her ample fortune to his brother; he represented Camelford in Parliament, and was Lieutenant-Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. The second son, Jonathan Phillipps, originally a surgeon in the navy, married the coheiress of the Amys of Botreaux Castle, and through them of the Cottons, and also of the Gilberts of Tacbear ; this gentleman had several children, but sur vived them all. He was knighted on the celebrated occa sion of Margaret Nicholson. The third brother, William Phillipps, a clergyman, never married. They had one sister, who married Mr. Carpenter, of Tavistock; and her descendants are possessed of nearly the whole of the Phillipps property. This farm, however, was demised by Mr. William Phil lipps to his relation Mr. William Dinham. It would be improper not to mention, that Captain Wil liam Bligh was a native of this parish, who commanded the Bounty in the unfortunate expedition to procure plants of the Bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus) from the South Sea Islands in the years 1789 and 1790 ; but which object he effected in a second voyage, and afterwards received the appointment of Governor of New Holland. There does not appear to be any remains of the College or habitation appropriated to the Canons, who from re-"], [534, "46 ST. TEATH. ceiving certain shares of the tithe for their maintenance, were sometimes called Portionists. The Church is conjec tured to have been built in the reign of Henry the Seventh, from the circumstances of his arms appearing there in a manner to denote them coeval with the fabric. There are several monuments, and among them one to Mr. William Phillipps, probably father of the gentleman who removed to Camelford as an attorney, and grandfather to the three brothers mentioned above. He is stated to have been of Treveans, and to have died on the 12th of April 1712, in the 62d year of his age. The turnpike road leading from St. Columb by Wade Bridge and Camelford to Launceston, nearly surrounds this Church. It was for some years the great line of communication to the west of Cornwall, till in 1767 a commencement was made on a more direct line over Tregoss Moors on one side of Bodmin, and Temple Moors on the other. This road so entirely superseded the former as to cause an entire loss of capital to those who contributed towards making it; and the road itself fell back into a state of repair inferior to that of most parish roads. It has, however, recently been taken up as a new concern, and in 1835 a stage coach has been established on it. The Editor has heard from the Rev. William Phillipps, who died in 1794, that the making of this road was taken up as a matter of patriotism ; and that to assist the under taking, he cut with his own hands the figures on the gra- nite mile stones, which still remain. The entry of this parish, in the Taxation of Pope Ni- cholas, is thus : \" Sech (and in a note, Ecciia See Thete) taxat' ut sequitur. \u00a3. s. d.

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE. This parish is situated on rocks belonging to the calca reous series. On the eastern boundary, however, near the church, the slate is nearly connected with the porphyritic series ; here at Treburget is a lead mine in a blue pyrituous slate; the lodes run north-east and south-west, varying from two feet to five feet in thickness. The matrix of the ores consists of angular pieces of slate like fragments cemented by quartz, in which galena, blend, iron pyrites, and spathous iron occur. Proceeding northward, this lamillar blue slate is sue ceeded by a shining talcose slate; and at Rediver Mills on the road to Port Isaac, a hard compact rock is quarried for the roads, which contains veins of magnesian minerals ; this rock occurs on the side of a steep round-backed hill ; and those circumstances, combined with the talcose slate, render it probable that magnesian rocks may exist in the neighbourhood. These rocks are succeeded by slate tra versed by veins of antimony, similar to what occurs in Endellion."], [536, "48 TEMPLE. HALS. Temple is situate in the hundred of Trigg, and hath upon the north Brewar, south part of Cardenham and Warliggan, west Blisland, east part of St. Neot and Altar nun. As for the name, it is derived from the Latin Tem plum, and signifies amongst Christians, a church, chapel, or temple for performing Divine .Service or worship to God, by contemplation or action of body or mind. But here, in a more especial manner so called for, that this church or chapel was a cell or temple pertaining to the great master of the Knights Templars of Jerusalem, under its superior in the Middle Temple of London, now the lawyers' Inn, where was their chief manor or com mandery. This religious fraternity took an oath of con federacy, for aiding and assisting all persons, pilgrims, and strangers, that intended by way of Joppa to visit Jerusalem and the sepulchre of our Saviour ; who, for that by licence of the abbot of a church there called the Temple, in which they had their seats (as is now used in our churches), they were from thence called Templars. This district now in Cornwall, consisting only of eight tenements of land, and about thirty human souls, in the Domesday Book 1087, was taxed under the jurisdiction of Nietstone, still contiguous therewith. In the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester into the value of Cornish Benefices 1294, Capella de Templo was rated to First Fruits at 10s. In Wolsey's Inquisition it is not named.

This church was certainly founded by the Knights Tem- plars, in compliance with a custom very prevalent among the military monastic orders, of establishing Preceptories in desert and uncultivated places, with the view of introducing inhabitants, or of civilizing the few that might be scattered over a wilderness. The benevolent intentions of these gallant knights failed however in this particular instance : the parish, which, judging from the analogy of similar cases, must have been large, perhaps co-extensive with the Moors to which it imparted a name, has shrunk into one of the least in Cornwall. Its church has disappeared. The churchyard is not distinguishable from any other inclosure ; and the few parishioners resort to neighbouring churches for divine service, for marriages, or for the administration of the sacraments.

Cultivation is, however, introducing itself by means of the potatoe, a vegetable destined to produce most gigantic effects on the condition of mankind ; greater perhaps than any other cause arising from the discovery of a new world. This little settlement was probably attached to the manor of Trebigh in St. Ive's, where the Knights Hos pitallers had a preceptory. Certain it is that the two pro perties have since travelled together, and are now jointly reposing with the Devonshire family of Wrey. The Rev. B. AV. Wrey was instituted to the benefice in 1789.

St. Thomas is situate in the hundred of East, and hath upon the north St. Stephen's, east Launceston, south South Pedyrvvin, west Egloskerry and Trewinn. For the name, it is derived from the tutelar guardian and patron of this church, St. Thomas the Apostle and Martyr (though as some say St. Thomas a Becket). In the Domesday Book 1087, this parish was taxed under the jurisdiction of Lan sen, now Launceston. In the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester 1294, into the value of Cornish Benefices, Capella Sancti Thom\u00e6 in decanatu de Trig majorshire, was then rated at 30s. In Wolsey's Inqui-"], [539, "51 ST. THOMAS. sition 1521, it is not named, having long before been wholly impropriated to the abbat or prior of St. Stephen's, who endowed it. TONKIN. St. Thomas is bounded to the south by Launceston and South Pederwyn, to the west by Trewinn and Egloskerry, to the north by St. Stephen, to the east by Launceston. This little parish is something in the form of an obtuse pile, being very narrow and wedged in to the east, where the church stands, in the very extreme part, between Laun ceston and St. Stephen's, but stretches itself out in length and breadth to the west. Part of it, which is called St. Thomas's Street, is within the borough of Launceston, and comes home to Launceston North Gate, but is divided from Newport and St. Stephen's by the little river Kensey, which runs by the wall of the churchyard. THE EDITOR. Mr. Lysons treats of Launceston, St. Stephen's, and St. Thomas together. There is very little remarkable about this parish. The church, which is very small, and provided with a tower scarcely more lofty than the roof, stands close by the water ; but it occupies the spot where the stately Priory described under Launceston heretofore extended its hospitality to travellers, and bestowed well intended, although mistaken charity, to all the neighbourhood. No thing more remains of the Priory than the foundation of walls and an arched well of excellent water. The church has some monuments. This parish measures 1750 statute acres.

TONKIN. Towednack lies in the hundred of Penwith, and has to the west Zennor, to the north the sea, to the east St. Ive's and Lelant, to the south Ludgvan. I take the name of the parish to signify no other than St. Wednock or Wynnock ; for Ta and Da are synonymous terms for good. [It is perhaps only Ti Widnak (C.) the Whitish House. W.] It is a daughter church or chapel of ease to Lelant, and goes in the same presentation. THE EDITOR. There can scarcely be a doubt of this parish, Landewed nack, and some chapels, being dedicated to one of the Mis sionaries from Ireland. Towednack, like most of the districts situated on granite, exhibits a strange and almost unaccountable mixture of cultivated and of unreclaimed soils. On one side of a fence may be seen land producing abundance of grass and excel lent for daisies, or bearing ample crops of barley, and of clover hay and on the other side, an inclosed waste, named throughout Cornwall a croft, producing nothing better than * This is in Ludgvan."], [542, "54 TOWEDNACK. the species or variety of furze, Ulex Nanus, and some of the most coarse grasses. This parish has been productive of much tin near the surface ; but a wide stripe of granite nearly resembling that of St. Stephen's in Brannel, extends from the parish of Zennor through Towednack, and thence into Ludgvan, including Castle-an-Dinas, which Mr. Hals by mistake places in this parish. Its course is distinctly marked by the absence of all bolder rocks from the surface, and in some places it has been wrought for china clay, found quite equal in quality to that near St. Austell, but occurring in layers of but little breadth, and therefore expensive to pur sue. This soft granite, called by the miners whetstone, permits the lodes to continue their courses through it from the hard and crystallized granite, but the tin in a great measure disappears at a trifling depth. There is little connected with Towednack of any curiosity, that does not refer to the Editor and his family. I am possessed of a manor still extending into five parishes, of which the vokeland, to use Mr. Hals's term, was Amellibrea in this parish. It has descended to me from the Noyes, and particularly from my direct ancestor William Noye, the Attorney-General. I have the Court Rolls in complete succession for nearly three centuries. On these Rolls the names of Godolphin, Grylls, Mahun, Praed, St. Aubyn, Veal, occur with others as free tenants, and a great number of persons held by copy of Court Roll. At Amellibrea are the remains of an extensive founda tion said by tradition to have formerly supported a prison. But the free tenants have been lost, and the copyholds converted into leases for life, as indeed has been the case generally over Cornwall, with the exception of ecclesiastical property ; the copyholds not being renewable on the pay ment of a fine not exceeding two years' value, as is the custom over most parts of England, but dependent wholly on the pleasure of the lord. The tenures were therefore in themselves much the same; and as I remember to have heard, the tenants preferred chattle property, as they termed"], [543, "55 TOWEDNACK. it, to copyhold, in consequence probably of the uniform rules of succession and the facility of disposing by will. The last copyhold that appears on the Rolls was in the very beginning of the last century. The particulars of holding a Court in those days, with the Steward's charge, happen to be preserved on the Roll for 1688, and seem to me sufficiently curious to warrant their insertion.

The Oath. You shall swear that you, as Foreman of this Homage, with the rest, shall duly inquire, and true presentment make of all such copyholds and things as shall be given you in charge ; wherein you shall spare no man, from love, favour, or affection ; nor present any man for malice, hatred, or envy ; but according as things are presentable, shall or may come to your knowledge, by information or otherwise, so shall you make thereof true presentment without concealment, So help you God, and the contents of this book. The Charge. Sirs \u2014 You that be sworn !

It standeth upon judgment, that you do not present any thing rashly, or unadvisedly ; but certainly to know the ruth thereof before you do present it. And it standeth upon justice that you do not for favour, affection, corruption of money, or other reward, for fear of any man's displeasure, or for any private gain or profit, leave any thing unpresented that is here presentable ; neither for malice present any thing contrary to truth. These tliree principal things you ought duly to consider of; and so hoping that you will have a special care thereof accord ing to your oaths and duties, and the trust that is reposed in you, 1 will cease to trouble you any further about them. First, you shall inquire whether all such persons as owe suit and service to this court be here to do the same ; and all that make default you must present. Also you shall inquire if any tenants be dead since the last court, or before, and his death not yet presented; and you shall inquire what lands he held of these manors, and what is due to the Lord on his death ; * and also if any copyholder has leased his copyhold for any longer term than a year and a day, without the Lord's license, it is a forfeiture of his copyhold. And also if any copyholder deny to pay his rent, or deny to come to his Lord's Court, or deny to be sworn of the homage, it is a forfeiture of his copyhold. And also you are to present all alienations that you may know among the tenants, who the)' are, and for what. You are also to present all such as remove any bounds bounding the lands of these manors and the lands of any other Lord, or between tenant and tenant, or elsewhere in those manors. You are likewise to present any one that has taken any * An Inquisitio post mortem."], [545, "TOWEDNACK. 57 goods out of the pound wilfully by force, or any pound breaker by the way, as they are driven to pound. You are likewise to present any man that hath fished or fowled in these manors, or hawked or hunted. And also you are to present any that doth refuse or neg lect to grind at the mill of those manors ; and if you are not well served, you that are ill dealt with by the miller, he is lyable to be prosecuted, and make satisfaction. You are to present all tin broken in these manors that hath not paid farme nor toll. You shall swear by the contents of that Book, that you will be true and faithful to the Lord of those manors, and shall from henceforth bear, do, and pay to your said Lord, and to his heirs, at times assigned, all such rents, customs, and services as you ought to pay, and for all such lands and tenements as you claim to hold of him. So help you God. As the Steward's name in not appended, I am unable to say who was the author of this perspicuous, eloquent, and argumentative address. It is probably in a great measure conformable to the approved model of that day. Having omitted to insert in its proper place a Petition from my great-grandmother to King Charles the Second, I shall give it here, as being in some degree connected with the property.

That your Petitioner's father served your late Royal Father of glorious memory in the late unhappy wars, and raised a Regiment of Foot, and another of Horse for that service, and was himself slain therein.* That your Petitioner's late husband was likewise active in his late Majesty's service, being a Colonel in the Army, and suffered very much for his loyalty in the late rebellious times, by whom your Petitioner had issue William Noye, esq. his son and heir, who is still living.

The church of Tremaine, now a daughter church to Eglos kerry, was consecrated in 1481, by the name of the chapel of Winwolaus of Tremene, with a cemetery adjoining, since which time it has probably been esteemed a separate parish.

There cannot be a doubt as to Mr. Tonkin's being the real etymology of this name. Mr. Lysons says, the greater part of the manor of Downeckney, anciently Donnegny, which formerly belonged to the Dinhams and Cardinhams, by descent from Richard, Steward of the household to William the Conqueror at the time of the Domesday Survey, is now vested in fee in Wil liam Braddon, esq. of Treglith in this parish, who is lessee of the remainder ; that remainder belonging in equal shares to the Trefusis family from the Rolles and VValpoles ; and to the representatives of the Gilberts of Tacbear through Cotton and Amy. Mr. Braddon inherited this property from his father-in-law John Spetligue, esq. who had purchased it from the family of Symons, who resided at Treglith. The church of Treneglos was given by the above-named Richard, so early as the time of the Conqueror, to the priory of Tywardreth. The great tithes, with the exception of some endowed on the vicarage, belong to the Eliot family of St. German's. The vicarage is in the gift of the Crown. Treneglos measures 2362 statute acres.

It is clear from the above figures, that there must have been some mistake, since such fluctuations never take place in parishes entirely agricultural.

This would indicate its being im propriated by the Abbey of Tavistock, as Werrington was the chief seat of the Lord Abbat ; but Tresmere is not noticed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of that Abbey ; but in the Valor Ecelesiasticus of Launceston Priory there occurs this trifling entry : \u00a3. s. d. Tresmare \u2014 Pensio . .018 The tithes of this parish are completely in lay hands. When tithes were first bestowed on monasteries, the duties of the Church to which they appertained, were per formed by members of the Convent, who occasionally tra velled there, and succeeded each other ; the \" book-bo somed priests \" of the Last Minstrel. In times more remote, secular clergy went on circuits from the Cathedral or seat of the Bishop .and bis priests ; till the inconvenience of this itinerant system became strongly felt, and decrees were made in several General Councils of the Latin Church,"], [553, "65 TRESMERE. enacting that each benefice should have a permanently resident priest, and that a competent provision should be made for his support. This was usually done by assigning to the deputy, the Vicarius or Vicar, all the tithes except those of com, although others were occasionally retained ; but in various instances, instead of tithes, an allowance was made in money, equivalent perhaps at the time, but long since reduced to nominal payments, by the gradual depre ciation in the value of gold and silver from natural causes, and by the fraudulent reduction of the standards practised in various degrees by all governments, or lastly, by the non convertible paper currencies. The very great difference in the circumstances of those deputies, arising from the nature of their endowments rather than any legal distinction in the offices, has affixed to one the name of Vicar, and to the other that of Perpetual Curate. It appeared from Mr. Tonkin's narrative, that the sti pend in this parish amounted to six pounds a year, and that it had been withholden by superior force ; without doubt, the liberality of modern times has long since caused it to be restored and increased. Mr. Lysons states, that the impropriation has passed through the families of Molesworth and Manaton, and that it is now vested in Edward Coade, Esq. and that this great piece of preferment is in the Crown.

This takes its name from the town, as that does from the three principal streets of which it consists, Tri, three, and Ru, a street, turned to Truro, euphoni\u00e6 gratia.

In an. 1291, 20 Edw. I. this church was valued (Tax. Benef.) at liijs. iiijc?. having never been appropriated. Leland (Itin. vol. III. sol. 11) speaketh thus of this town : \" This Creke of Truru afore the very toun is di vided into two partes, and eche of them hath a brook cum ming down, and a bridge, and the toun of Truru bytwixt them booth.

Out of the body of Truru creake, on the est side, breketh a crek estwarde a mile from Truru, and goith up a mile , perhaps to Kigan, and thens to Tresilian Bridge.\" Nothing can be better described than the situation of this town is here by Leland ; only as to the castle, it is so far from being a quarter of mile out of the town that it is in it at the head of St. Pancras-street, to the left hand of the way as you go to Kenwyn church, which by the bye is no Saint as Leland has here made it, or ever called St. Kenwyn. [The difference between Mr. Tonkin and his author concerning the castle, is no difference at all. Mr. Tonkin forgets the interval of time between Leland's writ ing and his own. At that time the castle was assuredly out of the town ; St. Pancras-street then going up but a little way from the open area by the church-yard, and the castle"], [565, "77 TRURO. being now \u25a0*\u2022* at the head \" of this street.] It lies very pleasantly, and from it you have a view of the whole town, the country around it, and the river, or rather arm of the sea, which, when the tide is in, looks like a fine canal of two miles in length, [and in coming up the canal by boat, the town with its new spire below, and the church of Kenwin with its new vicarage-house above, form a most pleasing view] ; but the castle itself is more like an old Danish camp or round, than a place that had been once inhabited, there not being the least sign left of any wall, &c. At the last visitation of this county (Heralds' Office) it is said that \" the town and borough of Truro was incor porated by the name of mayor and burgesses by Reignald Earl of Cornwall, natural son to Henry I. which as ap peareth by record, was done by Richard Lucy alias Lacam, testibus Rogero de Valitort, Roberto de Edune Anvilla, Ricardo de Raddona, Aldredo de St0.

Here I shall add some remarks that will illustrate the origin of this town more than Mr. Tonkin has done. Truro takes its name from its castle. This, in Leland's time, belonged to the Prince of Wales as Earl of Corn wall, and was therefore one of the castellated palaces of the Cornish Earls ; it was only a small one, however. This the ground of it shows when the walls are gone. Even in Leland's time, it was \" elene doun ; \" and the area was used as a place of exercise for shooting with bows and arrows, and for other diversions. It \"is now,\" says Mr. Tonkin, \" more like an old Danish camp or round than a place that had been once inhabited.\" What ideas Mr. Ton kin had of an \" old Danish camp,\" I cannot say ; but the castle carries no appearance of a camp at all, either Danish, Saxon, or Roman. Nor is it more like a round, if by \" a round \" Mr. Tonkin means a Cornish one, like the amphi theatrical \" round \" of Piran. The only remains of the cas tle, indeed, are the name, a waste area, and the old mount or keep, the earth of which is nearly gone, and is daily vanish ing by application of it to other purposes. This artificial mount marks the centre of the castle, had the main tower upon it, and constituted the principal part of the whole; and a small ward must have gone round it, standing on the natural ground, and forming the offices to this petty palace. This was plainly the origin of the town : \u2014 where an an cient Earl's house was, however smaM in its extent, and however occasional in its use, it naturally drew the traders of the country to it. The wants of such a Lord's house hold, and the accompanying treasury of a kingdom in a county, created such a call for wares, and produced such a currency of wealth, as made it for its season the little centre of trade to the adjoining country; and a town grew up in time, the weakly child of its castle at first, but able to sub sist without the castle at last. Such, undoubtedly, was the"], [567, "79 TRURO origin of Truro. This lay upon the more westerly of the two currents; the westerly side of the town, therefore, would be the primitive and original part of it ; accordingly, we see the White Friars' house constructed with it. From this current it extended, as it enlarged, to the easterly one. The erection of a church on that side, when a district was taken out of Kenwin parish, and the peninsulated ground between the currents was formed into a parish of itself, drew it easterly with great power. The town consisted at first, probably, of the street running from the foot of the hill on a part of which the castle stood, and extending backwards with its yards and gardens to the western cur rent; and this part of course adopted the previous appel lation of the castle, and was called with it Tre-vereu, Tre ureu, or Truru, Treuro, or Truro, the house or castle upon the Uro or Uru, the same denomination of a river with that of the Vere in Hertfordshire, the Vera-lamium of the Itineraries, the Uro-lanium of Ptolemy, and with that of the Eure in Yorkshire, the Uluracum, and the Is-ur ium of the geography and itineraries. So originating from the castle, in that primary part of the whole, the western side of the town, and in that most primary point of all, the line of houses above, the town would naturally shoot out next in the line of houses oppo site to this on each side of the opening towards the church, and beside the church on each side, drawn on by the strong attraction of the church itself. The roads into the town from east and west would then allure it down to their respective passes over the current ; the road from the west then coming down, as it still does, at the bottom of the first line of houses ; and that from the east coming within these thirty years by the narrow street near the church, at the corner of which is the rectory-house. The town would then extend from the western access into it, in a street of houses running at right angles with the original street of the whole, and pushing directly in a line from the access. These must have been the three streets from which Camden sup-"], [568, "80 TRURO posed the name to have been derived : \" Truro, Cornwal lice Treuru, a tribus plateis dictum,\" (page 138) ; but this last street was afterwards split by the corporation into two, by the erection of a town-hall above and a market-house below, along the middle of it. In this state stood the town probably for some time, with the continuance of this mid dle row of buildings, with the erection of a coinage-hall for tin a little beyond the termination of it, and with the extension of the two original sides of this third street up to it. It then stretched up the hill towards the castle, ranged over the confining currents on the east and west, into the parishes of St. Clement's and Kenwin, and expa tiated down to the quay and beside it. It ranged over the western current, now probably covered with a bridge, before it pushed up the hill towards the castle, as that line of houses is called Kenwin-street, even by Leland, and this is denominated St. Pancras-street by Mr. Tonkin ; that was then the way, the circuitous way to Kenwin Church, when this is the direct way, and the present; and the principal alteration which has happened to Truro since, has resulted from the erection of a new bridge over the eastern current, longer and grander than the other, a few yards lower in the channel than it, lining with the eastern road, and leading directly to the Town-hall and market-house. This natu rally produced a Bridge-street, leading up at one end of the Coinage-hall, so falling into what was then the principal stem of the town, and thus communicating with all the branches ; and all will be consummated in a few years by executing an Act of Parliament which has already passed, in taking down that middle row of buildings which is formed by the town-hall and its accompaniments, restoring this street to its original width, and multiplying houses for the dislodged inhabiters in the extreme parts of the town. When the church was originally built I know not, but it was then dedicated to St. Pancras, I apprehend, though it is now to St. Mary, as the street leading down to one cor ner of the large area at it, which is popularly denominated"], [569, "81 TRURO. Pider-street at present, is stiil denominated St. Pancras street by Mr. Tonkin ; but the present church of St. Maiy is of that light and elegant sort ot Gothic architecture which took place among us in the reign of Henry VII. and which perhaps might be wished to have still continued among us, as being a happy union of the solemn solidity of the Gothic and of the luminous lightness of the Ro man. At this period the church must have been built, the architecture of London by degrees reaching out its in fluence into Cornwall ; and accordingly in the southern window, which is the third from the east, is a date of 1518. But let me be more particular concerning the antiquity of Truro. Tlie castle is not mentioned in Domesday Book ; * it was therefore later than the Conquest. It was built by some of the Norman Earls of Cornwall, and was one of the rural palaces, as it were, which they had in the county subordinate to their grand capitals at Launces ton, Tremarlon, and Restormel. The town must be still later than the castle; yet it is noticed within a century after the Conquest, so nearly coeval was it with its cause, the castle. It is noticed above to have been in the possession of Richard de Lucy. It was incorporated, says the Visi tation above, \" as appeareth by record, by Richard Lucy, alias Lacam.\" \" Truro, Truru, or Trevereu,\" adds that best investigator of our constitutional antiquities, because the most grounded on the evidence of records, Dr. Brady, \" was some time in the possession of Richard de Lucy, a person of great note in the reigns of King Stephen and Henry II. in the eighth of whose [Henry's] reign,\" or, an. Dom. 1162, \"he was made Justice of England.\"f This Richard had got possession of this part of the old estates of the earldom, either by one of those half-aliena tions, which were only sub-infeodations in reality, or (as we shall soon see) by being Earl of Cornwall himself. He actually resided in the castle, as he is styled in an instru- * Brady on Boroughs, p. 42. VOL. IV. f Brady, p. 43. G"], [570, "82 TRURO. ment of Henry the Second's, \" Ricardi de Lucy de Tri vereu ; \" and he encouraged the little town of the Earls, by incorporating it, and so giving it a legal dignity in granting it an internal jurisdiction. He even proceeded to allow it that last and highest privilege of a borough, a freedom of exemption from toll ; nor was this confined to the borough itself; it extended beyond it; it extended into all the coun try round ; it was commensurate with the whole county ; and Richard must, therefore, have acted with a power, not merely of the lord of the borough, but of the earl of the county, as no one less than an earl could have given such an ample sweep of exemption. The proof of all this lies in the original charter of the town, not now in existence, but referred to in a succeeding charter, and particularised so as to be equal to the very charter itself. The town thus be gan about the year 1100, was incorporated about 1130 per haps, and was made a free borough (as we shall instantly see) before 1140. In the reign of King Stephen, who came to the throne in 1135, and in the fifth year of it, or 1140, Lucy resigned up the possessions of the earldom ; as then, \" Reginald Fitzroy, who was one of the illegitimate sons of King Henry the First, was created Earl of Cornwall.\" * Regi nald was, therefore, invested with all that Lucy had pos sessed. This he retained till his death, which happened in the 21st of Henry Il.f or the year 1175. We accord ingly find him extending his more than half-royal graces to his borough of Truro, by granting it a charter confirma tory of the privileges which Lucy had conceded to it be fore. \" The town and borough of Truro,\" says the Visita tion, \" was incorporated by the name of the Mayor and Burgesses, by Reignald Earl of Cornwall, natural son to Henry the First (which, as appeareth by record, was done by Richard Lucy, alias Lacam), testibus Rogero de Vali tort, Roberto de Edune Anvilla, Ricardo de Radiona, Al- * Brady, p. 43, from Dugd.

G 2"], [572, "84 TRURO. nec Comitalibus, nee pro aliqua summonitione eanl ad pla citandum alicubi extra villam Trivereu,\" a privilege conse quent upon the grant of an internal jurisdiction, and neces sary to its completion : \" et quod quieti sine de Tholneo dando per totam Cornubiam, in feriis et in foris, et ubicun que emerint et vendiderint,\" a privilege which must have been a very valuable one to a society of traders, and the more valuable from its long reach over all the fairs and markets of the county : \" et quod, de pecunia eorum accredita et non reddita, namium capiant in villa sua de debitoribus suis,\" by distraining the cattle, and arresting the persons of their debtors, that came into the town, though they did not belong to it.* This charter is without a date ; with so many and such witnesses no date being necessary ; and as it must have been prior to the Earl's death, it was before the year 1175. Henry the Second confirmed Reginald's charter, as Reginald confirmed Lucy's; and all were re-confirmed by Edward the First in 1284.f But in all these charters, we have no intimation of that grand privilege which we are sure Truro to have possessed, and which is alluded to in the Visitation above. \" Wre find also,\" says the Visitation, \" that the Mayor of Truro hath always been, and still is, Mayor of Falmouth, as by an ancient grant, now in custody of the said Mayor and Burgesses, doth appear.\" The superiority of Truro over all the harbour of Falmouth we see is here attested by a record of 1622; and \"an ancient grant, now in the custody of the Mayor and Burgesses,\" is appealed to by the record. This distinguishing privi lege had been ceded to Truro by a grant of a particular nature ; but from the manner in which the Visitation refers to it, the grant must have been so early as to be without a date, and so be like Reginald's and Lucy's charters be fore ; and it was probably, therefore, about the same .age with them.

Truro has long claimed to be the first town in Corn wall; and the station has generally been allowed, although several others exceed it in beauty of situation. Penzance in that respect, as well .as in foreign trade and the mag nitude of its internal commerce ; and Falmouth in the number of inhabitants. Truro, situated adjacent to the largest mining district, at the head of a navigable river, and nearly in the centre of population, has acquired the lead in all county concerns, and has the good fortune to possess many large handsome houses, and breadth of streets unknown in the other towns. Here, too, for a long series of years, was situated the chief place of education for the heirs of Cornish families, at a time when the state of communication between places two or three hundred miles apart, rendered it a matter of serious importance to think of sending a lad to either of the pub- lic schools. Two very eminent masters of the school at Truro are still remembered, Mr. Conor, a layman, from the north of England, or Scotland, by the tradition of our fathers; and the Rev. Dr. Cardew, by some among the best classical scholars in both Universities. There is a monu- ment to Dr. Cardew in St. Erme Church. It is also un- derstood, that their predecessor, Mr. Jane, either esta Wished or maintained the reputation of this school. Mr. Jane is understood to have been a native of Leskeard, and a nephew of Doctor William Jane, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford and Dean of Gloucester, who drew up the strong Declaration adopted by the University in favour of the principles which would have retained King James on the throne of England, and when the Revolution was effected, supported the opposite side, which gave occasion to the following epigrams:"], [574, "86 TRURO.

Jane, son of the gentleman who kept the school at Truro, became a student and tutor at Christ Church, from whence he retired to the college living of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire. Truro has produced its fair proportion of men distin guished by their proficiencies in literature, arts, sciences, and arms. Of persons living, I would select the Rev. Richard Polwhele, as an eminent historian, poet, and divine; and the Right Honourable General Sir Hussey Vivian, companion in arms of the Duke of Wellington, an active partaker in the glories of Waterloo, since com mander-in-chief of Ireland, and now (1836) occupying, perhaps, the highest office of the government not included in the cabinet. An individual, little if at all remembered, emanated from Truro in the sixteenth century, if he was not born there. Wood says, in the Athen\u00e6 Oxonienses : \" Thomas Farnabie, the most noted schoolmaster of his time, son of Thomas Farnabie, of London, carpenter, son of Farnabie, sometime Mayor of Truro in Cornwall, was born in London about 1575, and became a Student of Merton College in 1590 ; but being wild he made no long stay there, but left the college very abruptly, and went into Spain, and was for some time educated in a college belonging to the Jesuits. He left them, however, and being minded to take a ramble, went with Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkyns in their last voyage; after wards, it is said, he was a soldier in the Low Countries. Having suffered great distress after his return, he at last succeeded in establishing a school in Goldsmiths' Rents, near Red Cross Street in London, where at one time he made up a number exceeding three hundred generous"], [575, "87 TRURO youths. At length, upon occasion of some sickness, he removed about 1636 to Sevenoaks in Kent, in the neigh bourhood of which place (at Oxford) he had purchased an estate, and taught there the sons of several neighbouring gentlemen, by which he acquired considerable we;dth, and purchased another estate near Horsham in Sussex. He suffered some loss and imprisonment in the Civil War on account of his taking the Royalty side, and died at Seven oaks, where he is buried, in the chancel of the church, with the following inscription : \" P. M. Viri ornatissimi Thom\u00e6 Farnabii Armigeri, caus\u00e6 olim Regi\u00e6, reique public\u00e6, sed literari\u00e6 vindicis acerrimi, obiit 12 Junii 1647. \" Vatibus hie sacris qui lux Farnabius olim, Vate carens saxo nunc sine luce jacet.\" His principal works are, Notes on the Satyrs of Juvenal and Persius. Notes on the Tragedies of Seneca. Notes on Martial's Epigrams. Notes on Lucan's Pharsalia. Notes on Virgil. Notes on Terence. Notes on Ovid. A System of Grammar. Index Rhetoricus and Oratorius. Phrasiologia, Latin and English. Anthology of Greek Epigrams, with a Latin Trans- l.ition. Tables of the Greek Language. Various Letters to Learned Persons. Boyle says of him in his Dictionary, that Farnaby was a learned classic, and that his notes on the greater part of the ancient Latin Poets have been of much use to young persons; that he dedicated his Horace to Prince Henry, the eldest son of King James the First, and that he was most favourably received by the Prince when he presented his"], [576, "88 TRURO. work ; and that he received an order, or a request, to make similar commentaries on all the Latin Poets, in anticipa tion, in some degree, of the great work afterwards executed for the King's son in France. But the most remarkable and striking feature in the his tory of Truro consists of the great wealth acquired there by various families in succession during a song series of years. The first on record isthefamilyofRoberts,or Robartes, who are said to have began their career by retail trade in a house remaining at the commencement of this century, near the north-western extremity of what has been made the great street, by the improvement of taking down the middle row of houses, noticed by Mr. Whitaker, and completed by a new street leading from it southward towards Penryn and Falmouth. It is possible that the very humble commencement of the Roberts's fortunes may have been invented since their splen did elevation, to augment the wonder; but certain it is, that they resided for several generations in Truro, conducting extensive mercantile concerns, and accumulating capital, rather than obtaining it by any sudden effort ; and employ ing their savings in the acquirement of land by great or small purchases, or more frequently, perhaps, through the medium of advancing money on mortgage, till they acquired the most scattered estate of any in the county. About the veign of James the First, this family rose into high consi deration; they acquired an hereditary seat in Parliament, in a manner not very honourable at least to the Duke of Buckingham, and afterwards became decorated with the nominal office of Earl of Radnor : held the Lord Lieute nancy of Cornwall, with the Lord Wardenship of the Stan naries ; and, lastly, the office of highest dignity in the gift of the Crown, the Vice-Royalty of Ireland. The next considerable family emerging from Truro was the Vincents ; in their case the practice of law was added"], [577, "89 TRURO to trade; they repeatedly represented Truro in Parlia ment, and were among the first people of the count)'. One of their seats was Tresimple in St. Clement's, now the property of Mr. Vivian, of Penkalenick in the same parish ; but the family of Vincent has disappeared, and their very memory is almost extinguished. After the Vincents will come the Gregors, who have now been for a long period country gentlemen. The late Mr. Francis Gregor represented the county in three suc cessive Parliaments, from 1790 to 1806, when he retired on account of ill health. The next large fortune acquired at Truro was by Mr. Lemon. A short account of this very extraordinary per son has been given under Germoe parish. His very splen did career, not merely of acquiring wealth, but of high reputation for himself and of benefit to his country, began in the neighbourhood of Penzance ; and his removal to Truro is understood to have been occasioned by the discernment of Mr. Coster, a gentleman concerned in copper smelting works at Bristol, and a representative in Parliament for that city. Mr. Coster greatly augmented his fortune by purchasing the copper ores of Cornwall, for some time without a com petitor ; and undertaking to work some of the Gwennap mines in depth for copper, which had previously been pro ductive of tin, he selected Mr. Lemon for one of his partners, with unlimited confidence in managing the whole concern. Mr. Lemon was succeeded by Mr. Daniell, who took the whole of his great mercantile concerns off the hands of Mr. Lemon's executors in 1760, having acquired the com mand of capital by his marriage with Miss Elliot, niece of Mr. Allen, of Bath. The late Mr. John Vivian acquired also a large fortune residing in Truro ; and of persons now living, several might be added to the list. Mr. Richard Hussey has been noticed in the parish of"], [578, "90 TRURO. Feock as an eminent lawyer, and likely to have attained some of the highest honours of the profession ; he died un married in 1770. His father, who practised in Truro as an attorney, was the son of the Reverend John Hussey, vicar of Okehampton in Devonshire. The late Mr. John Thomas may also be included among those who have acquired fortunes and displayed ability at Truro: after retiring early in life to Chiverton, a paternal property in Perran Zabuloe, where he built an excellent house, Mr. Thomas was placed in the honourable office of Vice- Warden, which he executed with great credit for more than thirty years. Among persons distinguished for talents, one cannot omit Mr. Samuel Foote; he was born here about the year 1720, although the family seat was Lambessa, in the adjoin ing parish of St. Clement. His mother was the sister of Sir John Dinely Goodere and of Samuel Goodere, a Cap tain in the Navy, whose history almost equals in depth of misery the well-known tragedy of Penryn ; and it is a curious circumstance that Mr. Foote's first publication is a complete narrative of this most melancholy affair, in a pamphlet signed with his name, and addressed to Henry Combe, Esq. then Mayor of Bristol, in 1741. Mr. Foote's life and adventures are before the public in various forms. Recently two natives of Truro have distinguished them selves throughout Europe by a most important geographi cal discovery. The Mr. Landers, as is well known, de scended a large river from the interior of Africa to the sea, at what is called the Bite of Benin, where the river loses itself by flowing in divided streams through a delta created by the deposit of alluvial debris, brought down from the highlands by the force of its own current. A monument is now constructing on an elevated piece of ground at the southern extremity of the town, in memory of the brother, who has most unfortunately lost his life in a second expedition, intended for the establishment of a"], [579, "91 TRURO. friendly and commercial intercourse with the inhabitants of countries thus brought within our reach. An anecdote seems worth preserving relative to an inven tion, completely in anticipation of the use now made of steam for propelling vessels in all parts of the world. The mere idea of using this gigantic power instead of the human arm for moving boats and ships through the water, must have occurred to thousands ; the mode of effecting the application is the real invention. About sixty years ago Mr. Charles Warrick resided at Truro, a young man of some family and fortune, and bred to the law ; a person of singular and eccentric habits, dis playing much ability and genius in some cases, with an apparent want of both in others. Mr. Warrick partook of a taste very common in places situated on navigable rivers, for spending a large portion of his time on the water, cr in making contrivances relative to navigation; and he constructed a boat with slender ribs, covered either with canvass or with paper soaked in substances that excluded water : on each side he appended a wheel connected to gether by an axis turned in the middle into the form of a staple, or what is called a double crank. In this boat he frequently paddled from Truro to Falmouth Harbour, moving the crank with his hands, and out-running all other boats ; but no one thought of applying the construction to larger vessels, nor had he, in all probability, the slightest notion, that within half a century similar wheels and cranks, moved by steam-engines, would impel vessels of many hun dred tons burden through the most tempestuous seas, and against winds and tides, over extensive oceans, with a safety and a precision almost equal to land conveyance. As illustrative of the changes in all respects, that have taken place in the last three-quarters of a century, the fol lowing curious relation, although trifling in itself, may be allowed to find a place. A family about to embark at Falmouth, no longer ago than the year 1748 or 1749, hired a coach and horses in"], [580, "92 TRURO London to convey them there, a system of travelling prac tised on the continent up to the present time; the driver having delivered his charge, made known his desire for ob- o O i taining, what he perhaps denominated a back-freight, on easy terms, and a party of young men availed themselves of the opportunity, stipulating, however, that in the event of their reaching a town at any part of the day where cock fighting would take place in the evening, the coach should lie by to afford them an opportunity of being present at the diversion.

After the brother of St. Udith, Edward the Martyr, was slain, St. Dunstan had a mind to make her Queen of England to defeat Etheldred the lawful heir, but her piety or policy would not permit her to accept the proffer : she died Anno Dom. 984, and was buried in the church of Denis of her own building at Wilton.

The church of this parish is adorned with several splendid monuments, one to Mr. Anthony Nicoll, who distinguished himself in the Civil War, and another representing a mother and three daughters kneeling, with various arms emblazoned over them, Reskymer, Courtenay, Mohun, Trelawny, &c. St. Editha, the patroness of this church, as Mr. Hals conjectures on the assumed authority of Domesday Book, must have acquired a high degree of sanctity at a very early period of life, having died in her twenty-fourth year, after passing her time from childhood in the convent at Wilton, of which her mother was abbess; and, therefore, as it is observed in the Roman Martyrology, \" She may be said rather not to have known the world than to have left it ; \" but she fasted, wore hair-cloth next her skin, and chose to perform every office that was most disgusting or loathsome. In recompense, her beatitude was attested, according to William of Malmesbury, in a most decisive manner ; who says, that while Canute celebrated the fes tival of Whitsuntide at Wilton, lie spoke with ridicule of St. Editha, adding, that he never could believe the daugh-"], [585, "97 ST.

Ethelnodus, the archbishop, then present, contradicted the king, and proceeded to open the tomb of the virgin saint; when, raising herself up so as to sit, she seemed to attack the contumaceous king ; and he, terrified, fell prostrate on the ground, apparently without life ; but recovering, he expressed great joy, that by a renovation of his existence he found himself in a situation to be penitent for his fault. The presentation to this rectory is in the Dean and Canons of Christ Church. The Rev. Charles Hodgson, late student, presented in 1817, is the present incumbent. The whole parish appears to be well cultivated, notwith standing that it adjoins the granite district of St. Breward or Simonward, and it is agreeably diversified by hill and dale. It appears from Mr. Lysons that the manor of St. Tudy belonged to the family of Nicoll, but that it was sold toge ther with Penrose, the family seat, to Mr. Trehawke of Leskeard, by whom they have been devised to Samuel Kekewich, esq. The manor of Tinten, like so many others, either gave its name to the ancient proprietors, or received it from them. An heiress took it to the Carminows of Boconnoc. The Carminow property passed to the Courtenays, and fell to the Crown on the attainder of the Marquis of Exeter. This manor was included by King Henry the Eighth in the exchange given for the honour of Wallingford. The manor of Kellygreen belongs to Walter Raleigh Gilbert, esq.

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE. This parish no where reaches so far as the granite hills. Its eastern part is composed of rocks which pass into the"], [587, "99 TYWARDRETH. porphyritic series of St. Breward ; the western part rests on the same kind of rocks as those of the adjoining parish of St. Teath. TYWARDRETH. HALS. Tywardreth is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath upon the north Lanlivery and Luxillian, south the British Channel, east Giant and Fowey Town, west St, Blazey. The name signifieth the house upon the sand ; and by the same name of Tywardrai, it was taxed in the Domes day Book 1087. In the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester into the value of Cornish Bene fices 1294, Ecclesia de Tywardreth, in decanatu de Pow dre, was valued at cvis. viii/i. ; in Wolsey's Inquisition 1521, \u00a39. 6s. 8d. ; the patronage formerly in the abbat of Tywardreth, now Rashleigh ; the incumbent Wool ridge ; the rectory in Rashleigh ; and the parish rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax 1696, for one year \u00a3205. This church is wholly appropriated or impropriated to the prior or abbat of Tywardreth, before the statute of Richard II. ; and the vicar was paid only with \u00a311 modus or stipend per annum, out of the Duchy Exchequer of Lestwithiel. It was the chief alien priory in those parts, which name of alien priors or abbats arose soon after the Norman Conquest, when certain Englishmen, Normans, and French, gave lands in England to Monasteries beyond the seas; upon which the monks built convenient houses h 2"], [588, "100 TYWARDRETH. for increasing the number of those under their own rule, and to inspect their revenues and tithes, in which houses they planted a suitable number of monks, under a superior or steward. This priory or abbey was therefore accordingly made subject to the Abbey of St. Sergius and Bacchus of Angiers in France, soon after the Norman Conquest (to whom also is dedicated their church of Luxillian). The history of whom is as followed) : These saints were Christians and Noblemen of the City of Constantinople ; the one Primicerius, and the other Secondicerius ; that is to say, Sergius the First, and Bacchus the Second, Secre taries of State to the Emperor Maximian ; who for that they would not join with him in sacrificing to the Roman gods or idols, were cruelly tormented by the common hangman, and lastly had their heads chopped off, 7th October 310. There is pious mention of those saints in the Second Nicene Council, Martyrologers, and otherwise ; and many churches are dedicated to them in Constantino ple, and other parts of Christendom ; and the place in Asia where St. Sergius suffered, is called Sergiopolis to this day. This abbey was first founded by William Earl of Morton and Cornwall, according to the rule of Augustine and Benedict. It was afterwards re-edified and greatly aug mented in its revenues by Robert de Cardinham, tempore Richard I. 1190, (see the Monasticon Anglicanum of Dugdale) ; for which reason he is by some persons taken to be the founder thereof. This Robert de Cardinham I take to be the same person mentioned by the name of Robert de Cardinam, (Survey Cornwall, page 44), who held by the tenure of knight service seventy-one knight's fees of Morton in Cornwall, tempore Richard I. This abbey or priory house and church of Tywardreth, was dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle and Martyr of Christ, whose history followeth. He was born at Beth saida in the province of Galilee, elder brother of St. Peter,"], [589, "101 TYWARDRETH. and disciple of St. John Baptist, and was present when he pointed at Jesus, saying, \" Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world ; \" whereupon he left St. John Baptist and followed Christ. Who, for that, after our Saviour's Crucifixion, he would not sacrifice to the Roman Gods or Idols, at the command of Egeus Procon sul of Rome, sent governor into the province of Achaia, was crucified as his Lord and Master was, 30 November, Anno Dom. 60, in the reign of the Emperor Nero. His body was afterwards translated to Constantinople, from thence to Italy, and lastly to Amalphy in Naples, where it still remains. Now, by reason these alien priories transmitted to their superiors beyond the seas the news and state of affairs in this land, whereby the designs and undertakings of our princes were divulged to their enemies in their French wars; therefore all those sort of religious houses of this kind were suppressed by Act of Parliament, tempore Edward III. Richard II. Henry V. and Henry VI. ; and amongst them in Cornwall, Minster, alias Tolcarne, in Trigmajor, and Minster in Kerryer; St. Neot and St. Bennett's in Lanyvet in Pider were put down, and their lands confiscated to the Crown ; but this priory of Tyward reth, for its loyalty or integrity, or for some other reason of security, stood firm till the general dissolution of all those religious houses, 26 Henry VIIL when the revenues of this abbey, according to Dugdale, was \u00a3123. 9s. 3c?. Speed \u00a3151. Qs. 8d. as is set down in their Monasticon Anglica num. Mena-belly, alias Mena-billy, in this parish, is the dwell ing of Jonathan Rashleigh, esq. Commissioner for the Peace and Taxes, and some time Member of Parliament for Fowey, that married Carew of Anthony, his father Sawle, his grandfather Bonython, his great-grandfather Lanyon. Originally descended and denominated from the"], [590, "102 TYWARDRETH. local place of Rashleigh house, in or about Raneleigh parish in Chulmleigh Hundred in Devon. In this parish, towards the sea coast, is that famous camp or treble intrenchment, called Castle Dore, consisting of a threefold trench cast up of earth, in which heretofore our ancestors the Britons fortified themselves against their enemies ; out of which, as common report saith, tempore Charles II. some dreamers of money hid in this camp or place, upon search made, accordingly found such treasure as they much enriched themselves thereby. TONKIN. Trewardreth is in the hundred of Powder ; for the name, it signifies the village or the house upon the sand. It is a vicarage, not valued in the King's Book, as having been but lately endowed; the late incumbent was Mr. May, likewise Rector of St. Mewan, who died this year (1732). In the year 1291, 20th Edward I. the rectory of this church was valued at \u00a35. 6s. 8d. being appropriated to the priory here ; and the vicarage at 13s. id. In 3 Henry IV. William de Campo Arnulphi [or Cham pernoun] held here one fee, from whom the prior held three acres and a half in the same. There are what are still called the priory lands. But to go further back, as Robert de Cardinam was the founder of this priory in the time of Richard the First, according to Bishop Tanner in his Notitia Monastica, this must be one of the seventy knight's fees, which the said Robert held in this county, 6th Richard I. who by consequence must then have been lord of this manor. In Domesday Book it is, by the name of Tiward rai, numbered among the manors which William the Con queror gave to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made him Earl of Cornwall. Leland says of this place, Tywardreth, \" A praty town, but no market, lieth a quarter of a mile from the east side of the bay ; there is a parish church, and there was a priory"], [591, "TYWARDRETH. 103 of black monks, a cell sometime to a house in Normandy. Some say Campernulphus was founder of this priory ; some say that Cardinham was founder. Arundell of Lanherne was of late taken for the founder. \" I saw a tomb in the west part of the church of this priory, with this inscription : H\u00e6c est Tumba Roberti filii Wilhelmi. \" This Robert Fitz William was a man of fair lands, tempore Edwardi tertii Regis Angli\u00e6.\" THE EDITOR. The parish church and tower bear on the exterior an appearance of antiquity. Internally, much decoration was displayed, and especially by a rood-loft which has been recently taken down. These alterations of our ancient churches are justly lamented by all persons capable of admiring the beauty and imposing splendour of Gothic architecture, but they seem to have almost inevitably grown out of the change of purpose to which churches are applied. Originally, the chancel, protected by the rood loft and by a veiled entrance, was destined for the astounding miracle of repeatedly transforming bread and wine into the actual body and blood of Christ, while the outward or less sacred part of the edifice, was used for processions and scenic exhibitions ; accompanied by dirges or by triumphant choruses, adapted either to the death or to the resurrection of our Saviour. In modern times, on the contrary, a room is required so constructed as to admit of whole congrega tions joining with an individual in prayers, or of listening to his instruction. The monastery has so completely disappeared, that its precise locality was not remembered ; but a gentleman of the neighbourhood having taken considerable pains to"], [592, "104 TYWARDRETH. ascertain whatever could yet be discovered about it, made the following communication to the Gentleman's Magazine in 1822. \" The ancient priory c*L Tywardreth has long been so entirely levelled with the g-rpund, that it is not very easy even to ascertain its site. .Same time ago the present vicar obtained leave to dig the ground on its supposed site in search of stones for erecting a vicarage bouse. The place where he made an excavation for this purpose appears to have been the east end of the priory chapel ; and as some measurements were taken at the time, and I have, with the permission of the landlord, opened the ground in several places, partly with the hope of ascertaining the form of the chapel, and partly of throwing some light on its architec ture, the following particulars may not be unacceptable. \" The chapel appears, so far as could be ascertained by measurement, to have been eighty feet long, by fifty- seven wide, with a semicircular end towards the east, strengthened by four buttresses of wrought Pentewan stone, two feet wide, and ornamented by four pilasters ; within the shafts are a single half-column, fourteen inches in diameter. At each angle was a handsome piece of architecture, as it was described to me, of which pilasters, resembling those already described, formed a part, but with the base five inches wide, and the mouldings in proportion. \" In the vicarage garden, adjoining the west end of the chapel, a fragment of a stone arch was found, with a fleur de-lis elegantly carved in deep relief; the same devise appears on the church stile, and in a coat of arms in one of the windows of the church, and appears from Tanner to have been part of the arms of the priory. The wall of the chapel is the south wall of the churchyard. \" The chapel was paved with beach pebbles, and was built partly of common clay slate raised on the spot ; the wrought stones were of compact hard porphyry, from Pentewan Quarry in the parish of St. Austell, and hornblende from the cliff between Duporth and Charlestown in the same"], [593, "105 TYWARDRETH. parish. All the carved work is executed with much skill and taste.\" Several charters granted to this monastery are preserved in Dugdale's Monasticon. The earliest is in the 19th year of Henry the Third, A. D; 1234, as follows: \" Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angli\u00e6, Dominus Hibemi\u00e6 Dux Normandi\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6, et Comes Andegavi\u00e6, om nibus Archiepiscopis, &c. salutem. Inspeximus cartam Roberti de Cardinam, in h\u00e6c verba : \u2014 \" Robertus de Cardinam omnibus Sanct\u00e6 Matris Eccle si\u00e6 filiis salutem. Sciatis me, pro Dei amore et anim\u00e6 me\u00e6 salute, concessisse et pr\u00e6senti carta mea confirmasse eccle si\u00e6 sanctorum martyrum, Sergii et Bachi Andegavi, et ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Andre\u00e6 de Tywordrait et Monachis ibidem Deo servientibus et servituris, omnes donationes et con cessiones quas antecessores mei, seu quicunque fideles de feodo meo ipsis fecerint,\" &c. The seal of the convent is understood to have been a saltire, or St. Andrew's cross Or, between four fleurs-de-lis, which accounts for the sculptures noticed above. St. Andrew became the patron saint of Scotland, and popular throughout the whole island, after an Abbat, said to have borne the name of Regulus, had brought some of his relics to a place then called Abernethy, but where a Monastery, a University, and a city, have since arisen to commemorate the Apostle. The priory of Tywardreth appears to have been sup pressed with the other alien houses, but afterwards to have been re-established as an independent society, or made denizen according to the legal phrase, having at the time of the general dissolution the Priory of Minster attached to it as a cell, which had been originally dependent with itself on the Abbey of St. Sergius and St. Bacchus at An giers, the former capital of Anjou, and now of the depart ment of the Maine and Loire. A very curious correspondence between Thomas Crom well, Vicar-General and Vicegerent of the King's Supre macy on the one part, and Thomas Collyns the last Prior"], [594, "106 TYWARDRETH. on the other, is said to exist among the papers and docu ments preserved by the Arundells of Lanhearn, and of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire. * In one of the letters Cromwell is understood to have complimented the Prior on the possession of every active virtue, especially as displayed in the good government of his convent; he assures him that the King is fully sensible of his merits ; and in consideration of his great age and faith ful services, the King out of special grace and favour would allow him not only to resign the painful office of governing such a society, but would admit of his recommending a suc cessor. Collyns's answer is full of thanks to the Lord Vicegerent, and of gratitude to the King, whose approbation he esteemed above all worldly matters, and next to the conscious satis faction of having discharged faithfully his duties towards the Almighty in the station to which it pleased God that, without any merits of his own, he should be advanced. He offered his most humble and grateful thanks to the King for the great favours profferred to him; but that, feeling his health and strength sufficient for enabling him to o o o continue the discharge of duties which the King had approved, he owed it to his conscience not to withdraw from them. This brought a letter from Cromwell, declaring that the horrible savour of his sins, his crimes, and his iniquities had ascended before the Lord ; and that, unless he imme diately relinquished an office which he had most grossly abused, an ecclesiastical commission would proceed to inquire into his misdeeds, and to punish him accordingly. This latter is understood to have produced either an imme diate surrender of the priory, or Collyns's resignation pre paratory to it. He was elected in 1506, and died in 1539, as appears from his tombstone in the chancel. * A list of the Priors of Tywardreth, and extracts from a Calendar of the Priory, now in the possession of Lord Arundell, have been recently published in vol. III. of \" Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica,\" 1835."], [595, "107 TYWARDRETH. The site of this priory was granted in 1542 to Edward Seymour, then Earl of Hertford, afterwards Duke of Somerset, and Protector. It subsequently became the joint property of the St. Aubyns and the Pendarveses of Ros crow. The late Lord Dunstanville inherited the latter portion, and acquired the former by purchase. It seems that a manor of Tywardreth, which in early times must have been paramount over the others, passed from Ricardus Dapifer to the Cardinhams. Mr. Lysons says it was sold towards the latter part of the 13th century, by Isolda de Cardinham to the Champernownes, for a hundred pounds. From this family it passed to the Herles and Bonvilles, and fell to the Crown on the attainder of the Duke of Suffolk in 1554. It belonged to the family of Rashleigh, in the early part of the subsequent century; with whom it still remains, including the entire impropriation of the great and small tithes. Menabilly has been the seat of that distinguished family for a period of at least two hundred years. At the last visitation of the Heralds in 1620, Jonathan Rashleigh of Fowey, who married Alice, daughter of Bonithan of Kertleowe, is said to be alive, having two sons. The eldest John Rashleigh, aged 34, and Jonathan Rashleigh the second. John Rashleigh, ancestor of these two brothers, in the fifth degree, is stated to have been of Barnstaple. Individuals of this family have represented Fowey during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Charles the First, Charles the Second, and King William ; and since the accession of King George the Second, up to very recent times, scarcely a Parliament has been assembled that could not count a Rashleigh among its members. Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh was elected Member for Fowey in 1728, and continued to represent that town in eight successive Parliaments, and in the last with his eldest son. This gentleman married Mary, daughter of Sir William Clayton of Surrey, and died in 1764, leaving a very nume rous family, all of whom have been distinguished as persons"], [596, "108 TYWARDRETH. of ability, of integrity, and of honour, followers of the best advice said ever to have been given by a parent. Aiev apiareveiv, Hat ' vweipo^ov eppevai aXXuv, MjjSe yevos irarepoiv aia^vvepev. Mr. Philip Rashleigh, the eldest brother, represented Fowey during a length of time almost equal to that of his father. He greatly improved the family seat, but especially distinguished Menabilly by placing there the most extensive and magnificent collection of Cornish minerals, enriched by others from every part of the known world, that could any where be seen. And Mr. Rashleigh has given to the public, in two thin quarto volumes, fifty-three coloured plates, with descriptions of the most choice or rare spe cimens. The work is entitled, \" Specimens of British Minerals, selected from the Cabinet of Philip Rashleigh, with general descriptions of each article,\" printed by Bulmer and Co. the first volume in 1797, and the second in 1802. At the end of the second volume is added a Geological Plate, being a section of the stream work at Porth in the parish of St. Blazey, about a quarter of a mile from high water-mark, containing the position and measurement of ten distinctly marked deposits, with subdivisions, accompanied by descriptions of each ; the whole extending to a depth of 44 feet : and what adds to the value of this section, the stream work was destroyed by a very high tide about the period when the volume was published. In addition to this scientific collection, Mr. Rashleigh constructed a grotto at some distance from the house, encrusted on the inside by some common but splendid minerals, exhibiting also the position of lodes, their heaves, their slides, &c. and this was liberally thrown open to all persons applying for admission. Mr. Rashleigh married very late in life, and dying with out children, left his ample estate to William, the eldest son of his next brother, the Reverend Jonathan Rashleigh, Rector of Silverton in Devonshire."], [597, "109 TYWARDRETH. Mr. William Rashleigh succeeded his uncle in the representation of Fowey, but voluntarily retired from public life to enjoy domestic happiness, with the esteem and regard of every one who has good fortune to be num bered among his acquaintances. Polkerris, a small harbour near Menabilly, as indeed is indicated by the first syllable of the name, has been im proved, perhaps as a matter of fancy, by the Rashleigh family. Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh built a pier capable of giving shelter to coasting vessels and boats ; and his son the late Mr. Philip Rashleigh continued a sean fishery for the benefit of the neighbourhood. Kilmarth, which formerly belonged to a family called Baker, is also the property of Mr. Rashleigh; the house is placed on a very elevated piece of ground near the road leading from St. Austell to Fowey. Treveryan once belonged to a branch of the Courte nays: it passed by a purchase to John Thomas, esq. by whom the house was built. Mr. Thomas devised it to the Reverend John Thomas Thomson, who died at Penzance in 1811; and the estate now belongs to his son Henry Thomson, esq. resident at Lostwithiel, a magistrate, and late a captain in the Cornwall militia.

The extreme northern part of this parish, in an angular form, extends upon the granite, surrounded on all sides by the granite of Lanlivery. The remaining parts of the parish are composed of schistose rocks, which next the granite are of the porphyritic series, but become of a doubt ful nature in the southern extremity ; these latter belong perhaps to the calcareous series, as do also some of the rocks in the adjoining parish of Fowey. The felspathic rocks next the granite, like those of St. Austell, are metal liferous, as is proved by the important mines of Lanescot and Fowey Consols. ST. VEEP. HALS.

In this cell of St. Syriac lived that celebrated author Walter de Exeter, a Benedictine Monk 1292, as Isaack in his Memorials of Exeter calls him, with greater probability than that he was a Dominican friar, as Bale saith, or a Franciscan friar as Mr. Carew tells us (Survey of Cornwall, page 59) ; who, at the request of Baldwin of Exeter, writ the life of Guy Earl of Warwick, who was the son of Syward Baron of Wallingford, and married Felicia, daugh ter and heir of Rohand Earl of Warwick ; which Guy, at the request of King Athelstan, fought a combat with Col brand the Danish giant, and slew him, since which time his valour and conduct hath been very famous. And Walter of Exeter for this book, and his skill in other histories, hath by Bale given him this character : \u2014 \" In historiarum cognitione non suit ultimus,\" that he was none of the meanest historians of his time; though Mr. Carew saith he only deformed the history of Guy of Warwick.

The site was granted in the 37th of Henry VIIL as parcel of the possessions of Montacute, to Laurence Cour tenay. St. Cyric's Creek, by which this house stood, is said to have derived its name from a saint so called, who was buried there, perhaps in the very place where the small monastery stood. The place has long since acquired the appellation of St. Cadix ; it belongs to the coheiresses of the family of Wymond. It is certainly a curious circumstance, that a work which engaged the attention and even the admiration of England for a long period of years, should have emanated in any way from a remote cell, consisting of two monks. Mr. Carew assigns 1292 for the date of this work; but Mr. Warton says, in his History of English Poetry, that a life of Guy Earl of Warwick was written by Giraldus Cam- brensis, who died about the year 1220 ; but the history of our renowned champion has been composed in Norman French, and in old English, both in prose and inverse; moreover, the first part of the romauce describing the adventures of a preux chevalier combating a la outrance to recommend himself to the favour of his lady love, is clearly by a different hand, and even of another age from the second part, which represents him deserting the idol of VOL.

The monk of St. Cyric may therefore have blended, enlarged, abridged, versified, or rendered into prose the achievements of Sir Guy, and his performance may have been peculiarly suited to the taste of his age. The second place to be noticed is Trevelyan, the original seat of the very ancient and respected family that has resided for the last three hundred years at Nettlecombe in Somersetshire, which they acquired by a marriage with the heiress of Whalesborowe. The names of Whalesborough and of Trevelyan occur among the Sheriffs of Cornwall in the time of the Plantagenets, and also together as repre sentatives of the county ; and the name of Trevelyan may be sound in the same lists for the county of Somerset. It is extraordinary that of this ancient seat one half only belongs to the family. It would almost suggest the snspicion of the other part being lost from want of attention, when the intercourse between distant places was interrupted by difficulties unknown to modern travellers. Few traces remain of the ancient mansion. Mr. Lysons notices several manors in this parish, with their descents or sales, but without any thing that can make them interesting, except perhaps the notice that a manor called Manely Coleshill formed a part of the ample estate possessed by Lord Chief Justice Trevilyan.

Aulerci Eburorices, now Eure\u00e6 in Normandy, Aulerci Diablentres, Aulerci Cenomanni, now Mans, and Elerci Branovices. In this parish is the dwelling by lease of Richard Tre vanion, gent, captain of a foot company in the militia, that married Maunder, his father , his grandfather Arundell, originally descended from the Tre vanions of Tregarthin and Caryhayes, and giveth the same arms with them. His son Richard, that married Verman, was bred up in the school of Mars, under King William III. in his wars, wherein he accompanied him as captain of a foot company in all his Irish and Flanders war; and lastly, was posted to the command of Pendenis Castle in Cornwall, where he died. His son Nicholas was also bred up in the marine regiments of King William III. and afterwards had the command of the , 5 a third-rate man-of-war, and demeaned himself so well therein, in point of valour and conduct, that after King William's death, he was knighted by Queen Anne, and is now one of the commissioners at the dock of Plymouth for the Admiralty.

In the Domesday Book are taxed also the vokelands ol two other manors, which I take it are now dismembered and situate in this parish, viz. Treviles, or Trefilies, and Govile. TONKIN AND WHITAKER. Veryan is in the hundred of Powder, and is bounded to the west by St. Just, [by Gerrans,] by Philleigh, by Ruan Lanyhorne, and by St. Cuby, [by Ruan Lanyhorne and the Fal,] to the east by St. Ewe and St. Michael Carhays, to the south by Gerrans and the sea [rather by the sea only, Gerrans being only west and south-west]. The name of this parish is a corruption, or rather abbre- viation of St. Symphorian, of which name there are two ; one, saith Mr. Willis (Not. Parl. vol. II. page 119), \" born (as the Legenda Aurea tells us) in Augustinum, the head city of Burgundy, where he suffered martyrdom on the 22d of August, about the year 270.

I. \" Ecclesia de Elerky 10 lib. vicar' ejusdem, xl. solid.\" from the great MANOR OF ELERKY. In Domesday Book it is called Elerchi, which signifies the swan's house or swannery ; for Elerk in Cornish is a swan, and tliere are the remains of a large pool under the house, which seems to have been designed to that end. It is in the said book inserted among the manors given by William the Conqueror, to his half-brother Robert Earl of Morton and Cornwall. Francis Tregian, esq. among the rest of his estates, forfeited his half of this manor. WHITAKER. The original name of this parish was the same with the name of the manor Elerchi, or Elerky ; that the appellation of the manor in Domesday Book, this in the present time, and both derived from the manerial house. This house stood upon a rising ground, nearly opposite to the church, and on the west of it, which is now covered with severa houses of a mean condition, and yet marked as something considerable to the eye, by a grove of tall trees upon it. The great house, which the ancestors of these trees shaded, has been long down, I suppose ; and the mean houses on the ground have been constructed of the poorest remains of it It was bounded on the south by the lane leading down"], [607, "119 VERYAN. to its own mills, still called Elerky Mills, and distinctively noted as higher and lower ; and on the east and north by its lively brook, without a name, that divides the glebe from the manor, then environs the house, and finally runs to the two mills below. The manor is accordingly noticed so late as the 5th of Charles the First, to have two mills within it. These mills even now proclaim their original relation to each other, by the restrictions which the higher is under to the sower, in not being able to keep up the water from the other, beyond a certain space of time. And the house thus environed by the brook could not have been very small, as it was the mansion of a district, which in the 12th of Ed ward the First was reckoned at forty-two acres, when so many are valued in much less, and when so few are valued in more ; but whence is the original name of this bouse derived? Mr. Tonkin derives it from Elerk (C.) a swan, and makes Elerky to signify the swannery, adding, that \" there are the remains of a large pool under the house, which seems to have been designed to that end.\" In all that part of antiquarian researches where the eye is to be assisted by the imagination, and the past to be collected from the broken appearances of the present ; every active and lively mind is apt to cry out against the creative fancies of the antiquarian poet, and to exclaim in the language of Shakspeare, As imagination bodies forth The form of things unseen, the Poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. But this spirit of exclamation should be checked. What depends in any degree upon imagination, may by minds without imagination be easily turned into ridicule. What is only to be inferred by slow and painful collation of cir cumstances, will be ridiculed at once by those who are too brisk to be slow, and too lively to take pains. And the very ingeniousness of antiquaries themselves, will at times"], [608, "120 VERYAN. be a snare to them also, by inducing them to cut short the labour of investigation, to ridicule the dull laboriousness of conjecturing industry, and to leap over the difficulty which it will not take the trouble to remove. On the whole, therefore, I think Mr. Tonkin's etymology of Elerky to be the only one which is easy and natural, and his reference to \" remains of a large pool under the house,\" to be sufficiently grounded. There has evidently been something of the kind there. A little dam below would easily make one now. The remains were probably more in Mr. Tonkin's time than they now are. And these corroborating, and corroborated by the positive import of Eala, (I.) Alarch (W.) and Elerk, Elerchy (C.) a swan, and the undoubted signification of the latter when thus combined Elerch Chy (C.) for a swan's house, compel us to adopt the etymon. But this name has been entirely superseded in popular use by the name of the saint. So much was the spiritual patron of a church considered and talked of, that his name was used to the total neglect of the other. But who was the saint of this church ? Symphorian, says Mr. Tonkin ; and Mr. Tonkin is right. It seems odd indeed to suppose such a corruption of a name as this ; Symphorian changed into Veryan. But we see in Leland, (Itin. ii, 112), that the parish of Trevenny at Tintagel in this county, \" is of S. Symphorian, ther caullid Simiferian.\" This is exactly in point. Symphorian was called, in this parish, as well as in Trevenny, Simiforian or Simiferian, in order to accom modate it more to our liquified pronunciation. It would then be sure to be abridged soon, for the more rapid pronunciation of it, by leaving out the first half of the name, and taking only the last, just as Elizabeth is popularly abbreviated into Bet. The name would thus be Phorian, Ferian, Voryan, or Verian ; as we have an estate in the parish before, denominated Tre- Veryan, and as the ordi nary appellation of the parish is St. Veryan in a record above, and in common conversation Veryan. And the time of observing the parish feast coincides with all, and"], [609, "121 VERYAN. confirms it; Symphorian, of Autun in Burgundy, having suffered martyrdom the 22d of August ; and the feast in honour of his martyrdom being observed accordingly. Eight years ago the feast was agreed, for the sake of the harvest, to be postponed one month ; as, upon the same principle, the memory of the parishioners says, it had been previously postponed one fortnight. It is now kept on the first Sunday in October, was previously kept on the first in September, and originally on the third Sunday in August. Nor can the name of St. Symphrogia, or Simprosia, which is said to occur as the title of the parish \" in many fines, records, &c.\" be any thing else than a corruption of St. Symphorian. And as a full evidence, I find the picture of St. Veryan and his wife were within memory to be seen in the eastern window of the church. The square tower of Veryan church appears from its position on the side of the church, and at the south-western end of the chancel, to have been an addition to the church. After the lord had deserted Elerkey for Ruan, the lord's chapel was lengthened out into a belfry, with a tower over it. The architecture 'of this tower seems to a passing eye different from that of the church itself. And within, I doubt not, evident traces will appear on examination, of the posteriority of the tower to the church. THE EDITOR. There is very little to add respecting Veryan. Mr. Ly sons states that the manor of Elerkey, which gave its secular name to the parish, now lost in that of the patron saint, belonged with Ruan Lanihorne to the family of Arch deknes, from them it passed to the Lucys and Vaux, &c. and that it was finally purchased by the late Mr. Francis Gregor in 1790. The Dean and Chapter of Exeter have the great tithes, and they are patrons of the vicarage ; and, what is perhaps without example in reference to so fluctuating a body, three"], [610, "122 VERYAN. successive vicars have stood in near relationship to each other. The Reverend Mr. Mills was succeeded by his son in-law the Rev. Jeremiah Trist, and Mr. Trist by his son, the Rev. S. P. J. Trist, who was instituted in 1829.

This extensive and interesting parish is entirely situated within the boundaries of the calcareous series. The pre vailing rock is a blue argillaceous slate, the surface of which, when perfect, is either glossy and irridescent, or finely striated : it alternates with several kinds of massive or coarsely lamellar rocks, into which it gradually passes. These rocks present the following varieties : a fine grained rock abounding in scales of mica ; a variety of greenstone or cornean quartz rocks ; and dark-coloured limestone. This suite of rocks offers many objects worthy of a minute inquiry, far beyond the limits of these short notices."], [611, "123 VERYAN. THE EDITOR. A very excellent account is given of the Veryan lime stone by S. J. Trist, esq. in the first volume of the Transac tions of the Geological Society of Cornwall. Mr. Trist says, The limestone occurs on the coast at Pendower Beach, and may thence be traced for a mile and a half inland. It comes to the surface, in three different places, nearly equidistant from each other, but at different elevations, the most inland being probably a hundred and twenty, or thirty feet above the level of the sea. In each instance it creeps out at the brow of a hill, and no where appears in the vale below, where it would seem originally to have stretched across the valleys, but to have been subsequently carried away, together with the accompanying matter, by diluvian action. In breadth it extends over a superficies of 350 yards, but alternates with an argillaceous schist, the lime itself never exceeding three feet in thickness, and that only in the upper beds of the strata. The lime scarcely amounts altogether to one eighth of the whole mass. According to an analysis made by the Rev. William Gregor, a good specimen of this stone consists of about nine parts in ten of carbonate of lime. Mr. Trist then gives a comparative statement of the results from calcining this limestone, and the well-known limestone of Plymouth, that 200 Winchester bushels of lime from the kiln, provincially called shells or foreright lime, are produced from 11 tons of the Veryan limestone, by the consumption of 46 Winchester bushels of culm, more universally known as Welsh stone coal ; but that 14*\u00a7 tons are required of the Plymouth limestone to give the same quantity of lime from the kiln, with the consumption of 56 bushels of culm, which would make the Plymouth limestone inferior to that of Veryan, in about 32 per cent."], [612, "124 WARBSTOW. as to quality, and about 22 per cent, more in regard to fuel. As a cement, its quality is remarkably good. Small spherical masses of oxide of iron occur in great abundance; they are, in the opinion of Mr. Gregor, pyrites in a state of decomposition, the sulphur having escaped. The colour of the rock is blue, and it is frequently tra versed by veins of calcareous spar. In the schist which immediately reposes on the limestone, mica appears in considerable abundance, and the whole is strongly impregnated with lime. It is of a soft crumbling nature, decomposing on exposure to the atmosphere, and in that state it is much esteemed as a manure. The floor on which the lime rests (probably the whole alternating formation) is an argillaceous schist, with veins of manganese, which have been partially wrought. Mr. Greenough has laid down on his map a broad line extending about E. N. E. from Gerrans and Veryan, crossing St. Blasey Bay and ending near Looe, with the inscription, \" calcareous matter along this line \" WARBSTOW. HALS.

The Editor recollects having seen the entrenchment many years ago ; that it struck him as much resembling the Roman works in Dorsetshire ; and as being of dimensions far more extensive than those of the usual earthworks in Cornwall. St. Walburge, the patroness of this parish, was the daughter of St. Richard, a King of the West Saxons, who is said to have died at Lucca in the year 722, on his way as a pilgrim to Rome. His daughter having become a nun in the monastery at Wimbourn Minster, was permitted by the Abbess Testa to depart with several other females who had taken the vows, for the purpose of assisting her relation .St. Boniface in his conversion of the Germans, and in establishing the angelic life among the women of this country. Crediton in Devonshire had the honor of St. Boniface's birth about the year 680, and Exeter has to boast of his education under the pious Abbat Wolphard. At about twenty-six years of age he undertook the conversion of Ger many, but was driven back by the war of Charles Martel. He was, soon after his return, elected Abbat of Nutcell, a place subsequently destroyed by the Danes, and never restored; he left this high situation, however, and, fortified by the Pope's blessing and encouragement, he went a second time into Germany, where he succeeded to so great a de gree as to found the Archbishopric of Mentz ; to receive a plenitude of power with the gift of a pall from Rome, so as to establish Bishoprics at his discretion ; and with an alteration of his name, which from an unfortunate asso ciation in the English language, seems to us very con trary to what was intended.

Having ascended to the pinnacle of terrestrial glory, he at last obtained the crown of martyrdom through the medium of an ignorant mob excited by the priests, whose craft he had destroyed. Little is recorded of St. Walburga except the general piety of her life and the miracles performed by various minute subdivisions of her relics, which sufficiently attested her beatitude. There is a chui-ch dedicated to St. Wal burga at Bristol. The great tithes of this parish are in the Eliot family. The vicarage is in the gift of the Crown, being annexed to Treneglos. Mr. Lysons says, that the chief manor in this parish, called Fentrigan or Ventrigan, belonged to the Priory of Tywardreth, and that it was one of those given to the Duchy of Cornwall in exchange for the honour of Walling ford.

Another manor of the same name, be longing to the Corytons, was purchased by John Trengove, otherwise Nance, Esq. in the year 1680, from whom it has descended to James Wyard Gooch, Esq. of Orford in Suffolk. The manor of Carborro or Carburrow has been for a considerable time in the family of Arscott Bickford, Esq. of Deansland in Devonshire. The church and tower of this parish suffered most severely from lightning so recently as in the year 1818, when on Saturday the 14th of March, according to the accounts then published, the tower was almost shivered to pieces, and a part falling on the church, nearly destroyed the whole interior, as well as the roof. The improvidence and carelessness of mankind, in respect to contingent dangers, more especially when they are un connected with individual interest, is not in any instance more manifestly displayed than in what regards precautions against the tremendous effects of lightning.

Magdalen's church at Lanceston), this being dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, as its tutelar guardian. This WTike St. Mary was the birth-place of that famous minion of fortune and example of charitable benevolence Thomasine Bonaventure. Whether so called from her success in worldly affairs, or from her ancestors, is altoge ther unknown to me ; most certain it is she was born of poor parents about the year 1450, tempore Henry VI. but not so poor but that her father had a small flock of sheep that depastured on the wastrell of Wike St. Mary downs or moor, whereof she was the shepherdess, (see Carew, p. 282, Lord Dunstanville's edition,) who on a certain day in that place doing this office, it happened that there passed by a London mercer or draper that traded in this country, who was going to visit his customers in those parts, and gather up such monies as there were due from them to him for such wares as he sold. This gentleman, at first sight, observing the beauty of Thomasine, desired to talk with her, and, after some discourse, found her discreet answers suitable to the beauty of her face, much beyond her rank and degree. Then inquiring into her circumstances, as to her riches, and understanding that she was poor, and she likewise inquiring into his wealth, and where he lived, which was as aforesaid; whereupon he told her, if she would go to London and reside with him as a servant, he doubted not but it would be very conducive to her wealth and preferment. Thomasine replied, that she was under the guardianship of her father and mother, and that she could not accept his proposal without their consent; but if they were made acquainted therewith, and approved thereof, and he ap peared to them to be such a person as he pretended, she knew nothing to the contrary but that she might embrace his offer. Whereupon this Londoner forthwith applied himself to her parents, and gave verbal assurances, that if they would permit their daughter Thomasine to go to London,"], [621, "133 WEEK ST. MARY. and become a servant to him, she should not only have good wages and be well used, but in case he happened tc die while she was with him, he would so effectually provide for her that she should not have occasion to try the friend ship of any other person afterwards ; and to strengthen those his proposals, he produced some of his acquaintance and debtors in those parts, who satisfied her parents as to his reputation and integrity for performance of what he pro mised. Upon which report Thomasine's parents consented to his request, so that soon after she was conveyed or carriea up to London, and entered as a servant in this gentleman's house, when she demeaned herself very well, to the good liking of himself and family ; when it so happened that in a few years after, this tradesman's wife sickened of a mortal distemper and died, and some time after Thomasine and her master were solemnly married together as husband and wife, who then, according to his promise, endowed her with a considerable jointure in case of her survivorship; and about two years after, having no issue, he died ; and by his last will and testament further made her his sole executrix, leaving her a rich widow whom he took a poor servant. This dower, together with her youth and beauty, pro cured her to the cognizance of divers well deserving men, who thereupon made addresses of marriage to her, but none of them obtained her affection but only Henry Gall, an eminent and wealthy Citizen of London, to whom, after he had made another augmentation of jointure in case of her survivorship, she was accordingly married, and lived in great amity and reputation with him as a wife for some years, till in fine this Mr. Gall sickened of a mortal distem per whereof he died, and left Thomasine a richer widow than he found her, aged about thirty years. After which the fame, virtue, wealth, and beauty of the said Thomasine spread itself over the City of London, so that persons of the greatest magnitude for wealth and dignity there courted her; and amongst the rest it was the"], [622, "134 WEEK ST. MARY. fortune of John Percivall, Esq. to prevail with her to be come his wife ; after which it happened that he was chosen Carver at the table of the feast of Sir John Collet, Knt. Lord Mayor of London, the 2d of Henry VII. anno Dom. 1487, at which time, according to the custom of that City, Sir John drank to him in a silver cup of wine, in order to make him Sheriff thereof for the year ensuing (in conjunction with Hugh Clopton, Esq.); whereupon he covered his head, and sat down at the table with the Lord Mayor of London, and was accordingly one of the Sheriffs thereof. Afterwards, in 14 Hen. VII. 1499, the said John Percivall, was elected Lord Mayor of London, and knighted by that King, at which time Thomas Bradberry and Stephen Jen ings were Sheriffs thereof. By this gentleman our Thomasine had a third augmen tation of jointure and wealth, together with the title of Dame or Lady, which she lived many years to enjoy after the death of Sir John Percivall, Knight. After which, Dame Thomasine, having no child by either of her three husbands, spent the remainder of her days, till about the year 1530, when she died, in works of piety and charity; as repairing highways, building bridges, endowing or pro viding funds for poor maids, relieving prisoners, feeding and apparelling poor people, with her treasure and riches ; and especially in this parish of Wike St. Mary, where she was bora, she founded a chantry and free school to pray for her soul, the souls of her father and mother, her husbands and relatives. To this chantry and school she added a small library, with a fair house for lodgings for the school master, and chanters or singing men, and others, parts of which are yet extant; and endowed the same with \u00a320 lands for ever. In which place, during the latter part of the reign of Henry VIIL many gentlemen's sons, both in Cornwall and Devon, had their education in the liberal arts and sciences, under one Cholwell, a good linguist, as Mr. Carew saith. But, alas ! afterwards, in the Parliament of the fourth of"], [623, "135 WEEK ST. MARY. November, first of King Edward VI. 1550, all colleges, free chapels, chantries, fraternities, and guilds, throughout this kingdom, being dissolved and given to that King, this chantry and free school underwent with others the common downfall, and its revenues vested in the Crown, from whence it passed to , now in possession thereof. There are two fairs kept yearly in this parish on the 8th of September and the 1 Oth of December. THE EDITOR. The church is situated on an eminence, and is therefore conspicuous at a considerable distance in all directions ; it is large, and built in the usual manner of western churches with three aisles of equal height ; but the tower is so lofty as to exceed in height (according to report) any other in the county, even those at Probus and St. Mabyn. The church town is large ; and the inhabitants preserve a shadow of former traditionary importance by electing an annual mayor, who used at least to receive some volun tary obediences from his townspeople in the settling of .small differences between them. The etymology of the prefix Week seems to be less ob scure than most other additions to proper names. Week is in Cornish literally, sweet, an epithet frequently applied to female Saints. An alms, Sir Priset ! the drooping pilgrim cries, For sweet St. Mary and your Order's sake. To St. Agnes. Then cast, sweet Saint ! a circle round, And bless from fools this holy ground.

St. Mary Week is, therefore, sweet or beloved St. Mary ; indeed Treweek is known to mean sweet, beloved town or village. The Saxon wick is never, I believe, lengthened into week. Mr. Lysons says, The church town is in all ancient records called the borough of Week St. Mary, and the occupiers of certain fields are still called burgageholders. The ancient manor of Week St. Mary appears to have been merged in that of Swannacot, which belonged to the late Lord Dunstanville by inheritance from his great grandmother, heiress of the Heles. The manor of East Orchard Mauvais was purchased from Mr. Dennis Rolle by the late Sir John Call. There is a place near the church town called Castle Hill, believed to be the site of an ancient fortress. The advowson of the rectory belongs to Sidney-Sussex College in Cambridge, having been given to that Society in exchange for another immediately connected with his residence by Lord Carteret, who inherited the disposal of this preferment from the family of Grenville.

In deed I suspect it not to be true ; and what is more certain, that species of apples which in Cornwall we call a Borlase, and more commonly a Treluddera, pippin, appears plainly to have taken its name from this family and that place, and serves as a good opening for explaining all those other names of apples which are merely Cornish in themselves like this. Whitaker.] THE EDITOR. | It seems that Great Skewish, in this parish, belonged to a family of that name, one of whom was an author at a period so early as the reign of Henry the Sixth, when he compiled an abridgment of the Chronicles and the Wars of Troy ; but in all probability the work has never been printed, since it is not noticed by Warton ; nor is the author's name to be found in the catalogues of our public libraries. But the glory of this parish is Michael Tregury, Arch bishop of Dublin. Six or seven years ago, my attention having been drawn to this individual, who may justly be considered an honour to Cornwall, I applied to the Very Reverend J. R. Dawson, Dean of St. Patrick's, through his brother the Right Ho nourable George Robert Dawson, when the Dean most kindly and liberally supplied me with a drawing of Arch bishop Tregury's tomb, as it is restored by the celebrated Doctor Swift, and furnished me with all the particulars known of my distinguished countryman. I procured a wood engraving to be made of the draw ing, and sent it, with whatever I could collect of Tregury, to the Gentleman's Magazine, a reprint of which will here be inserted :"], [630, "SEPULCHRAL EFFIGY OF ARCHBISHOP TREGURY, IN THE CATHEDRAL OF DUBLIN."], [631, "ST. WENN. 143 Mr. Urban, Tredrea, Cornwall, March 2, 1831. You will much gratify me, and, I may venture to add, many other correspondents, by inserting in your most ex cellent repository, which has now survived one century with a spirit and vigour that give promise for its continuing through another, some particulars of an individual sprung from this county, who must have been a man of talent and of learning sufficient for adding lustre to any origin ; but who is now almost entirely forgotten, his family having long since become extinct, and the records of the University, of the Church, of the Diocese, and of the Province over which he presided, having in great measure perished in the devastations of the civil war, and especially of those ag gravated by religious dissensions. Mr. Lysons, in his History of Cornwall, states, that in the parish of St. Wenn is situated Tregury, Tregurra, or Tregurtha, the seat of a family so called, of whom was Michael de Tregury, Archbishop of Dublin, who died in 1471. The last heir male of the elder branch of this family died in the reign of Henry the Fifth, leaving three daugh ters coheirs, who sold this barton to the family of Botreaux, from whom it passed successively, by inheritance or sale, through the families of Hungerford, Hastings, Edgcumbe, Parkins, and Vivian, to Mr. William Hals, who wrote the Parochial History of Cornwall, and resided here in the latter part of his life. The estate, now called Tregotha, is the property of Thomas Rawlings, Esq. This brief notice of the Archbishop scarcely made any impression on my mind beyond a mere recollection of the circumstance, when a Cornish gentleman informed me that he had observed a monument to this Prelate in the Cathe dral at Dublin. I then took the liberty of applying, through Mr. Dawson, Member for the County of Lon donderry, to his brother the Dean of St. Patrick's, who not only gave me every information and reference that is known to exist, but also a drawing of the monument, of which I have sent a wood engraving. \u2014 Since this was engraved, I"], [632, "144 ST. WENN. have seen a tracing from an old drawing in the possession of Sir William Betham, Ulster King at Arms, which shows that the sides of the original altar-tomb were adorned with trefoil-headed arches rising from short pillars. It appears that few records are extant of the Prelates and Dignitaries of Dublin prior to the Reformation, in places where they might most reasonably have been ex pected to be found ; and the monument itself would have perished but for the care and attention of the celebrated Doctor Jonathan Swift, who, with the Chapter, exactly a hundred years ago, rescued it from a dilapidated chapel, and carried the monument to its present situation in the Cathedral. Michael Tregury attained his reputation for learning at the University of Oxford. He was Junior Proctor in the year 1434, under which Anthony Wood gives the following notice of him in his \" Fasti.\" He \" was now Fellow of Exeter College, and about these times Principal of several Halls successively that stood near to the said College. But the King, having a special respect for him (being now ac counted the utmost ornament of the University), made him Prefect or Governor of [the College at] Caen in Nor mandy, lately erected by King Henry the Fifth of Eng land ; which office he performing with singular applause, became at length, through divers preferments (of which the Deanery of St. Michael ofPencryche* was one) Archbi shop of Dublin in Ireland.\" The foundation of the College or University of Caen, is again mentioned by Wood in his Annals, under 1417. In consequence, he says, of discontents regarding preferment and tithes, \"the corruptness of provisions, and especially the wars between England and France, many dispersed themselves to other places. And because Normandy, Angiers, Poyc- * The Deanery of Penkridge in Herefordshire was not, however, an early preferment of Tregury, it having been annexed to the see of Dublin as early as the reign of King John."], [633, "145 ST.

I. p. 359 : \" Before the close of the same year ( 1449), M ichael Tn - gury, a native of Cornwall, and Doctor of Divinity of the University of Oxford, was consecrated Archbishop of this See. He was a man of such great eminence for learning and wisdom, that in the year 1418, King Henry the Fifth invited him over to Caen in Normandy, to take upon him the government of a College, which that Monarch had then sounded in the said city ; to whom he joined, out of the Mendicant Friars, learned professors in all sciences.f There he is said to have discharged the trust committed to him with great applause, both by his public prelections and writings. A catalogue of his works may be seen in Bale and Pits. At last, upon the death of Talbot in 1449, he was promoted to this See by a papal provision, and was the same year, on the 10th of February (English style), restored to the temporalities by King Henry the Sixth, whose Chaplain he was: [But was obliged to submit himself to the King's favour, and renounce every clause in his Bull prejudicial to the Crown.J.] He was called into the Privy Council immediately, and had twenty pounds per annum \u00a7 * \" Jo.

I must leave the pas sage to the credit of the Annalist, not having met any hint of it elsewhere. There is extant in the Black Book of the Archbishop of Dublin (p. 82), a copy of a Bull of Pope Pius the Second, dated the 23d of November 1462, and directed to the Bishop and Archdeaconry of Ossory, com manding them to pronounce excommunicated, Geofrey Harold, Thomas and Edmund his sons, Patrick Birne, Thady Sheriff, Thomas Becagh, Robert Burnell, and other laymen of the city and diocese of Dublin, for laying violent hands on this Prelate, and committing him to prison ; and that they should keep them under excommunication until they went to Rome for absolution, with the testimonials of the Bishop and Archdeacon. The reason of this insult is no where mentioned, that I can find. He repaired the manor house of Tawlaght, and died there in a very ad vanced age, on the 21st of December 1471 ; having governed this See about twenty-two years. His remains were conveyed to Dublin, attended by the clergy and citi zens, and buried in St. Patrick's Church, near St. Ste phen's altar [as he had directed by his will], where hereto fore might have been seen a specious monument, adorned Transactions for 1798, this sum would be equal to almost six and a half limes as much as the same nominal sum at the commencement of the present century; that is, 130/. a year. * See the letters patent hereafter, p. 149."], [635, "147 ST.

And at the head of the statue, ' Jesus est Salvator meus.' \" This monument was found under the rubbish in St Stephen's Chapel ; the cover of it was preserved by the care of the Rev. Dr. Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's, and the Chapter, who in the year 1730 fixed it up in the wall, on the left hand, as you enter the west gate, between the said gate and the place where heretofore the Consistory Court was held ; and they have placed this inscription over it : ' Vetus hoc Monumentum, e ruderibus Capell\u00e6 Divi Stephani nuper instaurat\u00e6 erutum, Decanus et Capitulum hile transserri curaverunt, A.D. 1730.' \" The will of this Prelate, dated the 10th of December 1471, is extant among the manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin (B. 52), whereby he deviseth his two silver gilded saltsellers (salsaria) with their covers, to make cups for St. Patrick's, to serve in divine offices. He also bequeathed his pair of organs to the said Church, to be used at the celebration of divine service in St. Mary's Chapel. ' I devise also (says he) that William Wyse, whose industry for this purpose I choose, shall in my stead visit with a decent oblation St. Michael's Mount in Corn- wall, which by vow I am bound to perform either by myself or proxy;' and also orders him to give some largesses to wards building the neighbouring churches near where his friends dwell. \" The registry* of the Dominican Abbey in Dublin gives an account, that above fifty persons went out ol the Ware's MSS.

Diocese to Rome in 1451, to celebrate the jubilee then held under Pope Nicholas the fifth, and that this prelate gave them recommendatory certificates to the Pope ; that seven of the number were pressed to death in the crowd, besides what died in their return. This squares with the relation given by Mathias Palmerius, in his additions to the Chronicle of Eusebius, ' That there was so great a concourse of people from all parts of the Christian world at this jubilee, that at Hadrian's Mole almost two hundred perished in the press, besides many who were drowned in the Tiber.' They who returned safe in 1453, brought the melancholy news, that Constantinople was taken by the Turks, and the Emperor Constantine Pal\u00e6ologus slain. Our Archbishop was so afflicted at the account, that he ordered a fast to be kept strictly throughout his diocese for three days together, and granted indulgences of an hun dred years to the observers of it ; and he himself went be fore the clergy in procession to Christ Church cloathed in sackcloth and ashes.\" The works of Tregury are thus noticed by Pits, in his volume \" De illustribus Angli\u00e6 Scriptoribus : \" \" Multa scripsisse perhibetur, qu\u00e6 Gallis inter quos vixit vel Hibernis apud quos obiit, magis quam Anglis e quibus natus est, nota esse poterunt.

There are several monuments to former residents and proprietors in the parish. Among these is one to the memory of George Hele, of Bennetts, esq. who died in 1652, and of his son Warwick Hele, who died in 1650. The family of Hele had resided for many generations at Bennetts, which came into the Basset family in the latter part of that century, by the marriage of John Basset, esq. of Tehidy, with Lucy Hele. Their great-grandson, the late Lord Dunstanville, was in the habit of visiting Ben netts for several weeks at a time. This place had been leased for lives to a respectable family of the name of Webbe, probably soon after it came to Mr. John Basset.

The Church of St. Winnow is beautifully situated on the eastern bank of the river, at its most beautiful part, between Lestwithiel and Fowey. The church, with its tower, are fine objects as seen from the river, which does not yield in this spot to the Dart itself. The Church con tains several monuments. The vicarage house and glebe partake of the splendour of the scenery ; and during the lifeof theirlate proprietor, the Reverend Robert Walker, were among the most attractive spots in Cornwall. Mr. Walker, possessed of strong abilities, had an ardent desire to discharge all the duties attached to him as a clergyman and as a country gentleman, in a man ner the most beneficial to all with whom he had any con cern ; in the relations of private life he was equally estim able ; and as a most decisive proof of his real merits and high deserts, it may be truly said, that, although he was induced on principle to take a strong part in politics, he had not a single personal enemy. The chapel, dedicated to the Recluse of Hertland, has still divine service occasionally performed in it, although it does not form any practical division of the parish. The history of Ethy has been brought down to the period immediately preceding its possession by the Edgecumbe family ; the house has been occupied of late years by seve ral gentlemen, and especially by one who has done honour to the nation by his naval and military services, and to Cornwall as a private man. Admiral Sir Charles Vini combe Penrose distinguished himself on so many occasions, that to enumerate them all would be to write a life. Two, which do not relate immediately to the more obvious fea tures of the military profession, may, however, be selected.

In the year 1814, when the Duke of Wellington invaded France from the Pyrenees, and his passage was disputed across the Adour, Admiral Penrose, uniting to scientific acquirements the skill and the bravery of an English sea man, constructed a bridge of boats where it was thought impossible to place them, and thus greatly contributed to the success of this important part of the combined attack.

THE EDITOR. This parish is beautifully situated, mainly consisting of a belt nearly a mile wide, between the sea on one hand, bounded by high and rocky cliffs, and on the other hand by a chain of granite mountains. The belt of land, including the church town, is very fertile, particularly abounding in milk and honey, which we early learn to consider as proofs of the most abundant soil. The church and tower are neat and plain, and it is pro bable that Mr. Hals's conjecture respecting its ancient dependence on St. Michael's Mount, may be correct, since one or more of the bells are said to bear an inscription declaring them the gift of the prior of the Mount. Mr. Tonkin says, that the name is taken from a patron Saint, but no such saint can be found; and the parish feast is kept on the nearest Sunday to the 6th of May, when the festival is observed by the Church of Rome, in commemora tion of the virtual martyrdom and miraculous preservation of St. John the Evangelist ; when, by the order of Domi tian, he was cast into a caldron of boiling oil before the Latin or Lateran Gate of Rome, where the church of St. John Lateran has since been built, the chief sacred edifice in Rome previously to the construction of St. Peter's, and celebrated for the assemblage of various general councils of the Catholic Church, thence denominated Councils of La teran. It is probable, therefore, that this parish may be under the protection of the divine and beloved Apostle. Towards the western extremity of the parish a bold pro montory stretches out into the sea, called Trereen Din.is, but in recent times, from some fanciful resemblance, the Gurnet's Head. This is by much the finest and most romantic point on the north side of the Land's End, and it would rival the promontory nearly opposite to it on the south, called by the same name, Trereen Dinas, or Castle Trereen, if that were not composed of granite and crowned by the Logging Rock ; while in Zennar the sea shore and"], [654, "166 ZENNAR. the cliffs are every where green stone, surrounding the granite. For a description of this headland, see the Second Volume of the Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, p. 200. The Editor was so much struck with the appearance of this bold formation, that he purchased the manor of Treen and Baswedneck chiefly for the purpose of acquiring the property of a mass of rocks so geologically interesting.

The greater part of this parish is situated on granite, whieh presents the varieties common to the Land's End district. The northern part, in the form of an irregular band, consists of schistose rocks, with the exception of a small patch a little to the north of the church, and another which extends from Polmear Cove to the western boundary of the parish. These slates are for the most part felspathic, and, at their points of junction with the granite, exhibit some beautiful illustrations of granitic veins in the slate. Note, that Penzance, by a mistake, is not numbered among the parishes [nor is Tregoney] ; so that the real number of them must be 204 [or rather 205] ."], [655, "167 GENERAL REMARKS ADDED HERE BY MR. WHITAKER. It is stated by Carew : Fol. 8. \" They [the Cornish Tinners] maintaine these workes [\" two kind of Tynne workes, Stream and Load \"] to have beene verie auncient, and first wrought by the Jewes with Pick-axes of holme, boxe, and hartshorne : they prove this by the name of those places yet enduring, to wit Attall Sarazin, in English, the Jewes' Offcast, and by those tooles daily sound amongst the rubble of such ivorkes.\" So, in the stream-work now prosecuted at Came between Truro and Penrin, were found two stems of deer horns, which I inspected at Tregothnan in Nov. 1792, and which had been plainly shaped into pickaxes. One of them was even tinged strongly at the picking end, with the stain of some metallic matter on which it has been employed. Not far from them was found a brass instrument, that had clearly, from the shade still remaining upon the covered part, once had a handle clipping it round the middle, and leaving out the two ends for striking. July 1 9, 1794, was promised by Lady Falmouth a sketch of all three, done by the hand of the Rev. Mr. Hennah, Rector of St. Austle; but, as he had pronounced the brass instru ment to be no celt, and as I proved it to be one, he never sent the sketch. \" There are also taken up in such works,\" adds Carew, \" certaine little tooles' heads of brasse, which some terme thunder axes ; but they make small show of any profitable use. Neither were the Romanies ignorant of this trade, as may appeare by a brasse coyne of Domitian's, found in one of these workes,\" stream or load, \" and fallen into my hands.'' Fol. 56. \" Most of the inhabitants can [speak] no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their owne, as to a stranger they ivill not speake it: for, if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way or any such matter, your answer shal be, Meea navidua cowzasawsneck, I can .speake no Saxonage.\" W.]"], [656, "168 THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. THE EDITOR. Neither Mr. Hals nor Mr. Tonkin has noticed these islands. It may be proper, therefore, to add a few observations on their ancient history, of which however very little is known. That the Ph\u0153nicians, and after them the merchants of Carthage, traded with the Britons for tin, is established without the slightest doubt ; but no possible absurdity can be greater than the supposition that voyagers, having sailed through the Mediterranean Sea, and passed between the Pillars of Hercules into the exterior ocean, and navigated through this boundless and dreaded expanse of water for about a thousjind miles, should then stop short at trifling islands, or rather rocks, and that too year after year during centuries, with the country before them, actually in sight, from whence the valuable commodity which they sought must have been manifestly taken, and where they would have been sure of an improved market for the commercial arti cles to be given in exchange. Yet, relying on the literal in terpretation of passages from ancient authors, who never visited the land of tin, nor possibly ever conversed with the adventurous sailors who had been there, persons of account have gravely asserted that the rocks of Scilly were the an cient Cassiterides ; while others, to render this strange sup position somewhat less absurd, have glossed it with the miracle, probably invented by Florence of Worcester, of a large tract of country between these existing islands and the Land's End, having been engulphed within times of re cent memory. Perhaps this mode of induction, directly opposed to com mon sense and to experience, may be a remnant of the hallucination which bound itself round men's minds at the"], [657, "169 THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. period when the stores of ancient learning were first poured on modern Europe ; under this delusion they were not contented with ascribing a high degree of merit to the artists, to the writers, to the architects of Greece and Rome; nothing short of absolute perfection was believed to exist in each, and this servile appeal to authority is not even yet quite obsolete, although the time for such delu sions being in the slightest degree advantageous either to literature or to science, has long since passed by. The. traders who frequented these remote shores would naturally mistake land in the great unbounded ocean sor mere islands, and their vague descriptions, purposely made obscure, proved so successful that Julius C\u00e6sar was not aware when he landed on the coast of Kent that he was arrived in the country producing tin. The rocks of Scilly, having inhabitants, were visited by monks and anchorites, who formed establishments there, and gradually associated themselves into a small priory; but, so early as the time of King Henry the First, their monastery, with all its appendages, was given to the Ab bey of Tavistock. The grant is extant. \" Henricus Rex Anglorum Willelmo Episcopo Excestri\u00e6 et Ricardo filio Baldwini, et Justici\u00e6 su\u00e6 de Devenesira et Comegallia, salutem.

This letter is addressed among others, to the con stable of his camp in the island of Enmour in Scilly. Enmour may well be a corruption of Ennis Moor, the great island, possibly the secular name of St. Mary's. In the time of Edward the Third, this priory or cell to Tavistock must have been of very little importance, since in the 19th year of his reign, it appears by the following entry in the Abbreviatio Rotulorum Originalium, that two monks only were resident. Since, for some reason which it is difficult to discover, secular priests were to be sta tioned in Scilly during the continuance of a war with France, instead of the monks, which gave rise to the fol lowing agreement : o o \" Abbas et Conventus de Tavistok finem fecerunt cum Rege per viginti solidos, pro licentia habenda, quod ipsi duos capellanos s\u00e6culares pro animabus progenitorum Re gis, quondam Regum Angli\u00e6, et h\u00e6redum suorum, in Insula de Sulley celebraturos, loco duorum Capellanorum commonachorum suorum, quos ibidem ex causa pr\u00e6dicta invenire solebant, durante guerra inter Regem et homines de Francia mota, invenire possint/' Since the Reformation the tithes have been appropriated, and passed with the different leases of the lands. Remains of the convent, most properly dedicated to St. Nicholas, are still to be seen on the island of Trescow. St. Nicho las was the patron of mariners, and frequently preserved vessels in a miraculous manner when his aid had been fer vently invoked ; perhaps the right of wreck was given to the convent for the pupose of attaching an increased de-"], [660, "172 THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. gree of merit to their prayers in favour of ships likely to be dashed against those rocks. St. Nicholas had also delegated to him from Heaven the peculiar care of infants, as a reward for his early piety, which induced him, in the first month, to abstain from taking the nourishment afforded by his mother's breast on Wednesdays and Fridays, and on all occasional fasts appointed by the church. He was Archbishop of Myra, a city of Lycia, in Lesser Asia, where he died in 342; but in 1087 his relics were forcibly taken from thence, and conveyed to the town of Bavi in Italy, towards the opening of the Adriatic, and where they continue to perform the most wonderful cures, more especially in all cases of infants. The Scilly Islands first became objects of public atten tion in the great civil war, and especially towards the latter part of these struggles. After the death of King Charles the First, Sir John Grenville, subsequently created Earl of Bath in memory of the battle at Lansdown, where his father fell in the arms of victory, having collected a small force, kept possession of St. Mary's island, where they either constructed or enlarged lines, rather than a fortress, which still remain. Their opponents encamped them selves on Trescow, till at last, as relief was clearly impos sible, the cavaliers surrendered, but not till they had evinced their honour and true feelings as gentlemen, by refusing to accept any terms from a foreign power, and preserving the integrity of England, although it was in the hands of their deadly foes. \" Unfortunately for these islands, they remain public property, or as it is termed, belong to the Crown ; and a sys tem has prevailed, at least from the time of Queen Elizabeth, one of the very worst that could be devised, of granting them at an annual rent, and for a short term of years, to private gentlemen ; renewed, indeed, in the same line for more than two hundred years, first to the family of Godol-"], [661, "173 THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. phin, and then to the family of Osborne, which succeeded to the property of the former, but always with an uncertain tenure and the impossibility of encouraging others to ex pend capital on any permanent undertaking. A better system has, however, been at last adopted, although very inferior to the plain, simple, and natural one of making the land freeholds in the hands of individuals. Either the former lessee for years no longer wished to retain a source of small patronage, rendered of little im portance by well-known changes, or the government re solved on doing something beneficial for the inhabitants and for the country ; at all events, a lease for lives has now been granted to Mr. Smith, a gentleman of ability and informa tion, the eldest son of a respectable country gentleman, under certain conditions, and among them a stipulation for essentially improving the harbour by the construction of a pier, the government contributing a certain sum towards the expense, and the lessee undertaking to complete the work. Mr. Smith, it is understood, means to reside there ; and great expectations are entertained of the benefit likely to result. Such a cluster of rocks, from eight to nine leagues west south-west off the main land, must always be dangerous to ships returning from distant voyages ; but the risk has been very greatly diminished by the excellent light on St. Agnes. There is, however, one rock called the Wolf, somewhat more than a third of the distance of Scilly from the Land's End, on which a light-house might be erected ; and the losses of lives and of property on this rock, which lies immediately in the way of all coasting vessels, more especially of those from Ireland, are supposed by many competent judges to exceed the losses occasioned by all the other western rocks taken together. Before lights were placed on the coast, and the sound ings laid down with accuracy, and the nature of the ground described, and before astronomical observations were"], [662, "174 THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. brought to practical perfection, the wrecks were, perhaps, quadruple to what they are at present, and with not one fourth of the vessels at sea: among the innumerable wrecks that have taken place at Scilly, the most remarkable is that of the Victory, a first-rate ship of war, commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, returning from a series of exploits, which continued adding to his reputation even when they failed of obtaining success. This ship, with two others of a smaller size, struck on the rocks of Scilly in the night following the 22d of October 1705, when between fifteen hundred and two thousand men are supposed to have perished ; and there is a tradition of one man having escaped, and of his relating some anecdotes of obstinacy, and even of violence, on the part of the Admiral, discreditable to him as a man, and the immediate causes of the calamity; but these additions induce me entirely to disbelieve the whole tale. The Scilly Islands are composed of granite, similar to that of the Land's End district, and intersected by small lodes of tin, but not of a size sufficiently large to have pro duced at any period a quantity worthy of mercantile ac count. The land does not rise into lofty hills, nor are the rocks on a scale of magnificence ; and the people have been so much absorbed in trade and in intercourse with strangers from all nations, that they are without any legendary his tories or peculiarity of manners. Although St. Mary's, Trescow, and St Agnes', St. Martin's, Bryher, and Sampson, have alone permanent inhabitants, yet a great many more islands are dignified with specific names. Among these one rock is honoured with the appellation of Scilly ; and this trifling circumstance has given rise to theories about changes and devastations by the sea, by earthquakes, &c. when the name has clearly been given in the same spirit as that which induced sea men to declare that the cord attached to the water bucket is the only rope belonging to a shin."], [663, "THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY. 175 Alterations in the laws respecting Customs and Excise, with increased vigilance as well as greater activity, both at sea and on shore, have materially interfered with the most lucrative trade of these islanders. They are, however, toler ably well supported by their agriculture, which is said to afford more corn than they consume ; by their fisheries, particularly of ling, which are exported after being pressed and dried almost without salt; and finally, by the resort of ships in great numbers when the wind happens to be in opposition to their intended voyages.

The Editor has been favoured with the following list of plants illustrative of the mild climate of Cornwall. The native plant of greatest curiosity is the Erica Va gans, Erica Didima of Withering, Erica Multiflora of Ray and Hudson. This plant spreads over the whole serpen tine formation of the Lizard, and observes its limits almost to a foot. It is said to appear again at Clickitor near Liskeard, where the serpentine formation is also found. The Ligusticum Cornubiense, remarkable only from its extreme rarity, grows near Bodmin, in a place called Mar garet's Wood. The Tamarix Gallica grows in great abundance about the Lizard, apparently wild, but it is said to have been brought there from St. Michael's Mount in the early part of the last century ; and St. Michael's Mount having been long a cell to Mount St. Michael in Normandy, the shrub may very probably have been introduced by the monks. It powerfully resists the sea winds, and grows freely on the banks of earth or sand surrounding inclo sures near the shore. The wood is so solid as to sink in water. The Panicum Dactylon grows on the bank of gravel lying between the sea, and the road leading from Marazion to Penzance. The Sibthorpia Europ\u00e6a may be found in great plenty about half a mile inland from thence, in a stream flowing westward by the road near Gulval church town.

Since the parish of Broadoak was printed, an additional sheet of Mr. Hals's manuscript has been communicated to the Editor by his friend the Rev. Richard Polwhele. It contains an account of the important military events which distinguished that parish and the neighbourhood, in 1644, and it is therefore printed as a curious addition to what has here been given in the body of the work, on the same subject. Mr. Polwhele has also sent another sheet relative to St. Stephen's near Saltash, but that does not contain anything of the least importance. These two sheets appear to have been separated from the work at Exeter by the carelessness of the bookseller in whose hands the whole had been lodged, and this con firms the suspicion of more important losses having taken place at the same time. BROADOAK. Broadoak is situate in the hundred of West, and hath upon the south Boconnock, west St. Winnow, east St. Py nock, north Cardinham; and by the name of Bradock it was taxed in Domesday Roll, 20 William I. 1087; which word, if it be single, signifies a rebel or traitor, one that betrays the trust and fidelity reposed in him by another ;"], [675, "185 BROADOAK. otherwise if it be commonly understood of Brad-ock or Brodock, it signifies broad trees of oak (Saxon). In the Pope's Inquisition into the value of Benefices before-mentioned, 1294, Capella de Bradock in decanatu de Westwellshire, appropriata Domui de Lanceston, was valued at xiii*. i\\d. from whence it appears the church was endowed by the college of St. Stephen's or Lan ceston ; in Wolsey's Inquisition or Valor Beneficiorum at \u00a38. 13*. id. ; the patronage in the Bishop of Exon, the incumbent Pearce, the rectory in possession of ; and this parish was rated to the 4*. per pound Land Tax for one year, 1696, \u00a357. Here let it be remembered that Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, General of the Parliament Army, being in De von, received orders from his masters, 1644, to march from thence with the same towards Plymouth, in order to raise the siege thereof, it being then greatly distressed by Sir Richard Grenville, as was the west part of that county, who immediately set forward with his army, and marched on towards that place ; yet not so quickly but that Gren ville had notice of his motion, and, fearing he was not strong enough to engage his great army, he by night pri vately dislodged from the siege of Plymouth with his own regiment, Colonel Fortescue's, Colonel Carew's, and Colo nel Acland's ; and the better to shun or avoid his enemy, marching down by way of Plympton, he turned aside towards St. Botolph's and Saltash Passage, where with boats he passed over his troops, and so entered over the Tamar river into Cornwall ; which Essex understanding as soon as he came to Plymouth, having thus raised the siege and relieved the town, forthwith marched after Grenville as far as Lestwithell and Bradoak Downs, himself quartering at Lanhydrock, the Lord Robartes's house, and sending out troops of horse westwards if possible to attack him. In the mean time, King Charles I. being then in Somerset with his army, and having notice of those facts of Essex's, forthwith marched out of Somerset through Devon with his army for Grenville's relief, and entered Cornwall by way of Polston bridge, the 11th of August 1644; from thence advanced to Lanceston, and so directly to Lis keard, which place for some time he made his head quar ters, where the townsmen and contiguous countrymen shewed themselves very zealous and loyal towards his ser vice, especially for that the town or borough and manor of"], [676, "186 BROADOAK. Leskeard was his son the Duke of Cornwall's lands, in right of his Duchy of Cornwall. Soon after which the country people gave private notice to the King, that on a certain day the quarter-master, General Dalbier, Lieutenant- Colonel Charleton, Colonel Allured, Colonel Barkley, and some other officers of Es sex's army were to dine at the Lord Mohun's house, not far from Lestwithell. At the day appointed the King dispatched a party of horse, and by surprise took them all prisoners (except Dalbier, who made his escape) and brought them all pri soners to Leskeard, where soon after Prince Rupert arrived at the King's army, which gave great hopes of a notable victory over Essex ; and, in order to give him bat tle, the King soon after drew forth his army from Les keard, and marched west to Bradock Downs in this parish, opposite to St. Winnow and Boconnock Downs, where Essex lay encamped, on the east side of Lestwithell town, and there pitched his camp and standard, he himself, Prince Rupert, and Grenville quartering at the Lord Mo hun's house; from whence he sent a letter August 16th, as he had sent another before from Leskeard by the Lord Beauchamp's nephew, to Essex, for a treaty of peace, to which he received no answer ; then he sent another letter to him in the name of the officers of his army, to which Essex sent a negative answer directed to the Earl of Forth, purporting that he had received a letter from his lordship, and other commanders of the King's army, by which a treaty with him was desired for a general peace, which he could not admit of without a breach of the trust reposed in him by the Parliament, having no power by his commission to treat in a matter of such importance. Whereupon happened several skirmishes between the cavaliers and parliament troops; and in particular that challenge and sharp charge between Colonel Straughan's for the Parliament and Colonel Digby's for the King, was most remarkable. Straughan's troop consisted of a hun dred young men from sixteen to twenty years of age, on whose faces, as was said, never razor had past in order to shave their beards, all double, if not treble armed for this encounter. This troop of Straughan's was led forth by himself on Bradock and St. Winnow Downs, having no thing on his head but a hat, and on the trunk of his body nought but a white linen shift, where thev braved it for"], [677, "187 BROADOAK. some time as was said before, giving defiance to a like number of the King's party in sight of the King and both armies ; whereupon soon after dislodged the Lord Digby's troop for the King, to accept and fight this chal lenge of Straughan's, who with great resolution and bra very advanced towards him, and gave the first onset or charge, but firing their pistols at too great distance, it did little harm to his adversary, whilst instantly Straughan, like a firebrand of hell, with a led horse by his side, had be fore commanded his boys, as he called them, to take their adversary's fire, which they then did with unspeakable hardiness, and rushed on to the very horse heads of Digby's troopers, that before had spent their shot, him self leading the fore front to the very points of their swords, when he discharged his double-barrelled pistols, and was in like manner seconded by his troopers, who had all the same sort of pistols, and most of them laden with tliree or four bullets each, which proved so fatal and dis astrous a blow to Digby's troopers, that the one half of them were slain on the spot or mortally wounded; and it was further observable, that scarce horse or man that escaped went not off without some hurt or damage, as I was told by one Mr. William Maye, a gentleman that was one of Digby's troop, and sorely wounded in this battle, the marks of which through his hands, arms, and legs were visible, though cured to a large degree, till his dying day, 1672 ; and much the like account I had of this battle or combat from Mr. William Upcott, of Truro, and Mr. Jo seph Upcott, of Morval, brothers, that were parcel of Straughan's troop, who there took some of the King's horses alive, their riders being slain, upon whose furniture was his proper arms, the star and the letters C. R. But, alas ! notwithstanding this success of Straughan's troop, the King with his army had so hemmed in or sur rounded Essex in his head quarters at Lestwithell, that he could not long subsist or have relief for his soldiers, for the Lord Goring and Sir Thomas Basset, Knt. stopped all provision with a great body of horse, that was coming to him by way of St. Blazey from the west, as Sir Richard Grenville did the like by way of St. Colomb, Bodmin, and Lanhydrock from the north ; whereupon it was resolved by Essex's council, that he should desert his army, and privately by night in a boat go down the river to Fowey, and from thence take ship for Plymouth, which expedient"], [678, "188 BKOADOAK. was accordingly put in execution, and the General Essex, the Lord Robartes, and some others the next day got into Plymouth, being the 31st of August 1644. On the same day Sir William Balfour with two thousand five hundred of the Parliament horse, with divers officers, viz. Colonel Nicholas Boscawen, his Lieutenant-Colonel James Hals, of Merther, Henry Courtenay, of St. Bennet's in Lanyvet, Colonel John Seyntaubyn, of Clowans, and his Lieutenant Colonel Braddon, Colonel Carter, and several other officers and gentlemen of quality, early in the morning forced their passage over St. Winnow, Boconnock, and Bradock Downs, though the body of the King's army, which lay encamped on the heath in those places, maugre all oppo sition to the contrary; from thence they rode to Leskeard, from thence to Saltash Passage, and from thence to Ply mouth safely the same day, amidst their own garrison and confederates. Notwithstanding this desertion of the general and other officers as aforesaid, Major General Skippon (a Londoner), like a good commander, resolved to live and die with his soldiers; and in order to their preservation, being at least twelve thousand men, he led them down the banks of the river on the west side thereof towards Foye, in order to transport them over the passage or river to Lanteglos, or ship them from thence for Plymouth, all other roads and high ways being stopped up by the King's army as afore said, during which march Skippon's men were sorely dis tressed in the rear by the King's soldiers, so that five of their field pieces were taken in the lanes, whereupon the next morning his men made a stand, and with a brigade of horse that never deserted the infantry, charged the King's troops with great courage and animosity, and beat them out of the field which they had lost the day before, with some loss ; whereupon immediately the King sent Captain Brett with the Queen's troop to attack them, who in the King's sight charged Skippon's brigade with that fury and violence as forced them to retire from the field aforesaid, whereby not only he regained the ground that was lost, but got some other fields from his party, and then re turned in good order, having lost only four men, himself being shot in the arm, for which brave adventure the King knighted him on the spot.

Observations on an Ancient Manuscript, entitled Passio Christi, written in the Cornish Language, and now pre- served in the Bodleian Library ; with an account of the Language, Manners, and Customs of the People of Cornwall. By William Scawen, Esq. Vice-Warden of the Stannaries. (From a Manuscript in the Library of Thomas Astle, Esq. 1777-) On the Manuscript itself. On the description of the Pas- sion contained therein. On the tongue in which the Passion is described, and the properties thereof and how it relates to and concerns the people and places of Corn- wall. Concerning the manuscript itself, (which is the ground of the fabric) the first thing that presents itself is the out side, which is not polished, but in a homely, humble simplicity, and written upon a rough old vellum, which may be supposed to be before parchments here came much into use ; and by the rude pictures set out there with, it may seem to be before the art of parting became better amongst us. Next to behold the chirography thereof, written in no other than the old Court Hand, not of the best form, but seeming somewhat older than we find it in other places, and some of the letters and characters different from the common Court Hand. As to the speech itself, it is such as the common speakers of the Cornish now used here do not understand, nor any but such as will be at the pains to study it, no"], [681, "SCAWEN ON A CORNISH MS. 191 more than the common speakers of the vulgar nation of the Greeks do at this day Homer's Iliad. So the Lord's Prayer in the year 700 was thus in English : Vren fader thic arth, &c. In 900, Thu ure fader the eart on heof enum. As to the antiquity thereof, we observe the name of our Saviour is all along written IHS, after the old form used in crucifixes, and then also the name written direst, not Christ. So we find it written in Tacitus, Suetonius, and in some other Roman authors it may be found. So Christians were called Chrestians, as Tertullian observes, Apol. c. 3.* And so the vulgar in Cornish speak it direst, and not Christ. In this old piece are no words antiently intermixed of the Saxon tongue or Angles, which shews, in all proba bility, that it was written before their time at least, if not much further off; whereas, the common speech of it now carries much of those latter figures, to the disfiguring of the face thereof. But of all other intermixion, it seems to receive in it (with a kind of delight) the tongue of the Romans, by whom the people were easily brought to take up that tongue which they brought with them, and after wards more and more by degrees in succeeding times, the Roman speech was interwoven with the Cornish, out of a natural propensity to it, as that tongue came to be used of all other nations afterwards, as was observed before. Another argument there is (and that which is to be admired and rejoiced at) that in this old piece of the Pas sion, there is nothing heretical, little of error to be found, or savouring of ill opinions ; which is strange, since it has passed through so many ages, in which so many ill broods have been hatched, and, amongst others, one of our own, the Pelagian heresy, a brat bred here amongst us at Ban gor. Nor is there any mention made of any monastical persons, or several orders of men so living. Nothing that refers to Monks, Friars, Priors, or to any other orders, secular or sacred, nor any thing said in approba tion or dislike of any such thing. There is nothing in it savouring of the old bards or their poetry, nor having references to Merlyanisms, but a bare and sober relation of matter of fact. * Dr. Hammond's Exposition to the Apocalypse."], [682, "192 SCAWEN ON A CORNISH MS. II. As to the description of the Passion and Resurrec tion of our Saviour, I cannot again but admire, that it is so unpolluted with the Arian or Pelagian heresies. There are, it is true, some inoffensive and harmless traditions, and a word may be let slip of the Virgin Mary ; and in those traditions you may observe the concurrence of others. And, first, concerning this Longis : it is to be inquired whether he be not that Longinus mentioned in our Calendar on the fifteenth of March, or that Longinus on the first of December ; for of Longinus there is the same history to be found in Picinellus his Mundus Symbolicus ;* whose words are, D. P. Comestor ad Longinum vitiosos et caligantes fuisse oculos, cum vero fluentem in Christi latere sanguinem casu illis admovisset, videndi acumen recepisse. In eandem Septentiam canit S. G. Nazian zenus.f Ubi fixit hastam, defluentis sanguinis Tinctam liquore, et ecce ! ut utraque manu Hausit, oculosque hoc ungit hinc ut scilicet Detergat oculum nocte, que cera legit, &c. When into Christ he thrust his tainted spear, Lo ! unto both his hands the blood flow'd there, Wherewith he anoints his eyes and then saw clear, Which like the night till that time blinded were. Mr. Lassells, in his Voyages into Italy, tells us, that the picture of Longinus stands under the top of the spear with which Christ's side was pierced, in the cupola at St. Peter's church at Rome. It may be conjectured, that this tradition owes its origin to the literal sense of that pro phecy ; \" they should look on him whom they had pierced.\" For the wood of the cross, (another of the traditions,) Genebrard's account thereof, as reported by Purchas in his Pilgrimage, p. 30, comes somewhat near it, which is, that Seth went to the Cherub which kept Paradise, and received three grains of the Tree of Life, whereof we read in the Apocalypse, \"The leaves shall heal the nation.\" With these three grains was an oil made, wherewith Adam was anointed, and the stones put into his mouth, whence sprang the tree whereof the cross of our Lord was made, hidden \u00bb Tit.

If any list to see further about the timber whereof the cross was made, let him read Mr. Evelyn's Sylva, c. 3, Num. 17- As to that of the smith's wife, in forming the nails for the crucifixion, perhaps they might think, that as the first woman had the first hand in the transgression, so a woman must be employed in the last act of this tragedy. We may observe, 1. What true and manifest notions these antient people had, and faithfully retained, of the Trinity, and the reve rence they gave them. 2. How distinctly and clearly they did set forth, iu those dark days they lived in, the several distinct attri butes of the Deity, assigning power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, goodness to the blessed Spirit. 4. How well they agree and adhere to the doctrine of the true church of Christ, in the points maintained by us con cerning the loss and fall of man and mankind, and the restoration of him, and concerning the eternal decree and purpose of God, in the salvation of man, notwithstanding his fall. We may observe by the Resurrection, thus shortly declared as it is, that it appears plainly that those people were not Nullyfidians. Nor were they Solyfidians. They placed the foundation of their happiness in belief. And the superstruction thereupon in good works. Lastly, we cannot think they were any way inclinable to the minds of those scoffers at the day of judgment, which St. Peter meets with in his second Epistle, 2, % and 10. Our people acknowledged, that at the Great Day of account a punishment shall be upon the wicked, and a glory expected to be given to the godly. Thus far as e taste only of what is contained therein.

The Innocency and Cleanness. vol. iv. o"], [684, "194 SCAWEN'S DISSERTATION 3. The Wisdom. 4. Significances of it. 1. For the Idioms. They put the substantive before the adjunct or adjective. 2. The preposition sometimes comes after the noun. 3. It is usual to change a letter in the beginning, middle, or end of a word or syllable, and sometimes to omit in each for sound sake. 4. They con tract several words into one for sound sake, and that very short also ; with many other changes, of which it is hard to know or find any certain rule now, but some may be made out upon reading, due observation and experience had on this that follows ; and for the pronunciation, the Cornish is not to be gutturally pronounced as the Welsh for the most part is, nor mutteringly as the iirmorick, nor whiningly as the Irish (which two latter qualities seem to have been contracted from their servitudes), but must be lively and manly spoken, like other primitive tongues. 2. For the Innocency of it. What is most remarkable is, that it hath a most excellent defective qualification in it, peculiar to itself ; for, whereas all other tongues abound in execrable oaths, the old Cornish have none at all, not so much as reproachful terms. The word that comes nearest to an oath with them is Areire, Areiaree, which is Mary, Mary, spoken by way of wonder. The next good defective qualification is, that there are no great titles in it, which Nutricule Tyrannidis. 3. For the Wisdom, Proverbs (which contain usually the wisdom of a nation) they have had, but we cannot find them in any great plenty. Yet some there are worthy observing, as these : Cows nebas, cows da, nebas an yeveren an gevella. Speak little, speak well, little of public matter is best. Cows nebas, cows da, hada veth cowsas arta. Speak little, speak well, and well will be spoken again. Taw Tavas.

Adam gave names to the creatures, according to their natures ; but the people of this land, having no better guide, have given names upon long experience had, and much observation made of the nature of things, and those do mostly appear now as to places and families. I shall adventure upon some instances : Lanceston, alias Dunhevet. Camden would fain have it to be Fanum Stephani ; indeed St. Stephen's, which is a mile off, seems to be the mother church, Lanceston the daughter church. Others would have it to be Lance- lot's Town, one of the Champion Knights of King Arthur, but that is further from truth. The Chief Justice Foster, talking with me about it, would fain have Dunhevet to be the most ancient name, from Dune a town, and Hevet above it, which there is accordingly. I told his lordship we must fetch the derivation higher, from the Cornish original (and not from the Saxon), and that is Leostofen, which is a place of large extent, or a broad end, which is properly so according to the situation thereof, at the broad end of the county, from whence it grows towards the west still narrower, like to the point of a wedge. I read in a good author, that Radulphus, brother to Alfius, Duke of Cornwall, was founder of Lanceston. I think he means the castle there, not the town. The names of places above, and from those places down- wards, have suffered much violence along the river from Devon side, by reason of the mutations formerly spoken of; but from thence we shall take notice of some that have received their names antiently, passing down the river of Tamar (and on some of the branches thereof) where, by the way, I may say I am astonished at some of our late Geogra- phers, who, in enumerating the famous bridges in all this have omitted altogether ours in Cornwall, of which, among o 2"], [686, "196 SCAWEN'S DISSERTATION land, other lesser, we have three that are very eminent, one of which, Wadebridge, stands further west ; the two others, besides many smaller, are on the river of Tamar ; one Horsbridge, the other called Newbridge. But much more I wonder at their omission among the rivers of the famous river of Tamar, a river, after the Thames, not behind any of note in this kingdom, which I mention the sooner, because it is most properly ours in Cornwall ; for though it be great and very navigable far up, yet it arises in and floats only in this little county of Cornwall, and its whole course contains within the same, and it is the boundary thereof from other parts, wherein other streams do flow, Linnar, Fiddy, &C. and before it falls into the Estuarium, where it gives entertainment from Devon on the other side to Tavy, Plym, Yeom, and others, where they all lose their names in Tamar. And I do much more wonder that it should be printed by some others, that this famous river should fall into the sea near the Land's End, where as this alone possesses the whole honourable harbour of Plymouth (more than sixty miles distant from the Land's End), and stands appropriated to the interest of Cornwall, belonging to the Duke thereof, the Prince of Wales. And to return to what I said last, in coming down from this broad end of the county to that famous harbour, though our next bordering neighbour Devonshire and the saints, have stolen away from us many of the antient British names, and intruded upon us many strange ones, yet some left us here and there of the antient speech all along, upon the river and the branches thereof, which 1 am obliged to memorize. Lawhit, in Glamorganshire, is said to be Fanum Iltuti, to which the Ton being added in Cornish, makes it up. Iltutus was an ancient British Monk in King Arthur's time. Landue may be the church or chapel of St. David, though Landuan in Cornish is the black church or chapel. And for Lezant, that is the holy saint, meaning St. Michael, to whom that church was dedicated. As Cargreene, which is a rock in the gravel standing in a green place. Carbeele or Carbilly, a rock mentul\u00e6 form\u00e6. Carkeele of the same signification. Landulph, where St. Dulpho is memorized by the church's name, and the well there so called St. Dulpho's well. Halton, i. e. Haelton, a green place near the water. Pillaton, a round or clue by a green. Larrake I did formerly suppose to have been from Laun"], [687, "197 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. or Lun, which is usuallyT set for a church or chapel ; but on better consideration I think otherwise of it now, because I find several other places hereabouts written Larrake, which have no reference to church ; and because the manor antiently was written and called Larrake, which is antienter than the church, and it signifies a place of con tent in Cornish* Blerrake I take to be of the same signification too ; a little from which latter place, if content may be had from a prospect, it is there in my opinion. A place formerly called Ballahow, now the fairest and amplest I know any where, excepting such as are dignified by the sight of a metropolis, or such places of eminency, though it stands not on a promontory, and but a little from the sea in a plain, though but a rough one, and from it you may look directly into the sea, as far as human eye-sight can enable you.

Towards the land northward, the wild moors of Devon, called the East Moors, and the other side the West Moors in Cornwall. Between those you may observe the vale countries of both, two rich valleys, one in Devon side, and the other in Cornwall, and take the sight of Tamar as their boundaries, and you will wonder, looking at it from above, to know how to think that river should find a way through those countries to the sea, especially if you consider that you seldom see water in those tracts of land by which it passes, yet jo\\i see also as it passes Plymouth the royal citadel, Plymton, Millbrooke, and abundance of small villages and boroughs in a country on each side pleasant, and the whole prospect not obscured by hills, or any thing else by which you may be hindered from the sun in any part of the day ; besides this over- looks the Eddy-rock or stone, a dreadful place about aleague out in the sea, where many hundred of ships have been wrecked, being in the trade way to the harbour from the west ; yet I have heard some antient skilful mariners to * Here passing down the river, I would willingly have given by the way an account of the antient Cornish name of that eminent place now called Mount Edgcombe, but by reason that the present, and some other genera tions, have been so much inclined to the name it now bears, and the other generations before them had given it the name of West Stonehouse, as in relation to that on the eastern side of tbe river East Stonehouse, where tbe mansion ot those gentlemen formerly was, (according to which I have seen an entry of it, Cum Perco et Passagio, in an antient Ouster le main) I could not attain to it."], [688, "198 SCAWEN's DISSERTATION aver, that if a good artist should go about to strike on this rock purposely, he would not be able to do it, so far doth chance go beyond art.

Here passing, we come by the mouth of the river to Pembernose, which is in Cornish the head of the night, or midnight, as if it were said that there is safe coming in there at any time ; and from thence we pass to the uttermost point westward, called Penlee, which is the headland to the leeward ; and so sailing along by the sea side to the two Gayers, the East and West Gayers near Ramehead, which may give nomination to families of that name in the west, which are now worn out there, and have had a good recruit in Plymouth, and from thence a better in London, by a late Lord Mayor, there so called, but taking his descent from Cornish original, according to the word. Rame is a long ridge of rocks, and here called Rame head, because it is so formed towards the sea like a ram's horn, which hath turnings in it to put mariners in mind thereof : in Cornish Pendenhar.

Luke's Day also is their day of feasting, and for choice of their Governor. This agrees well enough with the former as the fortification of it ; and towards the sea again we come to Lestwithiel. Some hold that to be lion's tail or lion's train ; others take it to be ' enough together.' The place, though now grown much in decay, hath formerly been held the only shire town, and where the Knights of the Shire have been still chosen, and the Convocation of the Stanneries held, &c. A great hall was lately there, which was used for those purposes in my knowledge, belonging to the Dukes of Cornwall, who did the like when under them ; and here also they kept their court and residence, near to which stands yet their castle Restormell, in Cornish a bellyfull of money, a place of honey ; besides which the Dukes had seven others, Lis- keard, Tintagell, Lanceston, and Trematon, which is in Cornish three hills on a green top, though that came to the Crown by attainder. As for the river Vz or Vzell, which some speak of, I suppose is a mistake ; the river there is the river of Fowey, in Cornish Foath, which hath its head spring in the moors above it, Venton Foath, in English called Foycombwell and Aqua de Fowey, As it comes further down near Foath, is a town or place called Tywardreth, in Cornish, a town on the sand, or above the sand, which agrees well with its situation, where heretofore there stood a priory, the buildings whereof are now decayed. I may not forget as next to Foath the town of Polruan, which is now a small village of fishing, but here- tofore famous, standing on the top of an ancient hill, where are the ruins of a spacious fair church, called yet by the name of St. Saviour's, Polruan is in Cornish, a frosty bottom, or frosty pool, this being seated over against Foath; between those two towns heretofore there went athwart the river a chain of iron from a small castle on each side, for their security against foreigners by sea, but by their neglect of preserving it in time of peace, was stolen away from them by some boats that came from Dartmouth in Devon, and carried there, where the river is of equal breadth, and the harbour is much like that of"], [690, "200 scawen's DISSHRTATION Fowey, and hath over against the town of Dartmouth a little town called King's Way, which answers to Polruan against Fowey. The Fowey men have attempted the resti tution of their chain, but never could obtain it, because they had been so careless, it being the means of their own preservation formerly. Between these two neighbouring towns of Fowey and Polruan, standing one against the other, in the harbour between them, there used to be antiently a solemn contention of justing performed upon the river every May-day, upon two boats singled out of equal strength, from the one side and from the other, to encounter each other upon the water, there being a stage made on each of them, upon the end of the boat, for the several champions to stand on. Several boats were to row with six oars a-piece, rowing fiercely against one another. The champions were arrayed only in white, slightly but better armed about the breast and neck, and holding a lance rebated in the form of an oar (according to their trade) ; but a fierce attempt they make upon each other, and one or both of them is usually carried by the push to sound the depth of the harbour, and then a new supply of others for fresh encounter is called for again. This I have seen to be performed in my time, and it usually drew abundance of people together to behold the sport from the hdls on both sides, and from the town, with many others, with boats likewise upon the river, and not without need, to receive up and recover their dejected champions, who end their encounters in peace, not without liquor, the element of their contention.

Wise, in that he was made choice of for one of the Commissioners for the happy treaty of marriage of Margaret, the King's eldest daughter, with James the Fourth, King of Scots, a happiness to the kingdom at this day. A good man, and not a pilferer of the people (as many were in those days) ; otherwise he would be named in Perkin AVarbeck's Declaration, set down by Chancellor Bacon. A good commonwealth's man, as appears by that stately and costly fabric of Newbridge built by him. Peale, a spire, lies to the north of Tolpenwith a mile, and it is the true Land's-end. This spire, called the Pele, stood on a little island; between it and the shore there is room for a boat to pass with oars ; the spire was ten fathom or more above the ordinary flux of the sea, very narrow on the top, hardly room for a man to sit on it ; in the floor it was and is fourteen feet square. In the year before King Charles the First was beheaded, it was prodigiously cut off in the floor by a storm, and falling broke in three pieces. Herles, truly interpreted Hercules' Pillars, are a ridge of rocks a quarter of a mile in length, standing like pillars divided into small islands, and distant from the Pele a mile. From these by the north coast we come to St. Ives, in Cornish Port Eer of Geer, a port with a pool. Paddestow, so called by Saxon Angles, being Patherick stow. Another place near by, called Little Petherick, which partakes not of the Cornish at all ; for in the Cornish it is Lethanneck, a place of much sea-sand, which agrees well with the site, much sea and much sand there is driven. A little above which is the house of Edmund Prideaux, esq. my kinsman, now called Place, formerly Guarandre, or Warthantre, i. e. above the town or above the sand ; but that we may do right to latter times also, we find much mention to be made also of Patrickstow, and that St. Patrick, after much time spent in Ireland, and endow ments of learning by long study were obtained, he came into Cornwall, and built a monastery there not far from the river of Severn, which comes home to that which is said by Archbishop Usher, as also to the name of the place.

But whether this were to be understood of St. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, it is altogether to be doubted, since as to the burial of his body there hath been so much con tention that that should be at Glastonbury ; but another Patrick there was, perhaps a third, and one of note too, stiled S\u00e6nor S\u00e6nex Patricius, as appears by the learned primate. He is said to be at the same time, and that he was Domesticus Sancti Patricii. Another there was also at some hundred years distance.

Near this town is the place where the Cornish forces, on behalf of King Charles the Second, obtained the glorious victory over the rebellious army, anno 1643.

There is a pretty vulgar fiction that Tamar, Tamara, being a subterraneous nymph, was courted and sought after by Tavy and Tawrage, who found her sitting under a bush at Morewinstow, the furthest part of Cornwall in the north. They being weary in searching after her, sat down by her and slept ; she perceiving them to be fallen asleep, steals away from them suddenly and goes directly to the south. Tavy being first awakened, goes away silently after her, not acquainting his co-rival therewith. Tawrage that awakened last, finding them both gone, in haste rusheth out, and angrily runs away towards the north, foaming and fretting all along as he goes, till he loses himself in the Sabrina ; whilst Tavy, on the Devon side, sends out some of his small streams to visit and court her, and to observe which way the nymph went, but she having got the start of him, leaves not of her speed till she comes into the Sound."], [693, "ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. 203 ANTIQUITIES CORNUONTANIC. The causes of the Cornish Speech's Decay. 1 . The first and great cause of the decay of the Cornish speech was their want of a character, which not only con tributed to the decay of the tongue, but to the vanquishing of the nation of the Britons, they being thereby disabled upon emergent occasions to write or communicate with one another against their invaders, and so \" dum pugnabant singuli vincuntur universi,\" as Tacitus says ; and he also observes, \" non aliud adversus validissimas gentes pro Romanis utilius quam quod in commune non consulebant.\" What would have become of the Roman tongue, when the Goths and Vandals broke in upon Rome and all Italy, mixing the Roman tongue with their Runa-Gothica, if there had not been learned men (amounting to 160 elegant classical authors in Augustus his time) who preserved the tongue in their works ? I know it hath been and yet is the judgment of learned men, that the old Britons never had any character, yet I hope they will give me the liberty of declaring the reasons of my dissenting. I. It hath always been supposed that Ireland had a character ; now Ireland was always accounted a British Island, however ; yet I cannot positively affirm that the character which the Bishop of Tuam sets forth as British be really so, there seeming to be little difference between that and the old Saxon ; neither can I consent to what he saith, that the Saxons, whom he calls their neighbours, learned their very characters from Ireland. 2. Though we may depend on C\u00e6sar's * authority, that Druidum doctrina non suit literis mandata, sed memorise suit, ne aut in vulgus proficiscentur, aut juventus qui earn perdiscebant negligentia aut in curia remitterent, which reasons, in my judgment, rather demonstrate that they had a character to communicate their doctrines by, if they had pleased to use it. II. The great use made of the Roman tongue, the laws of their conquest extending to letters and speech, as well as to territory ; and where there is a delight, there are things best retained. Romanam * C\u00e6sar de Bello Gallico, lib. VI. ch. 14. Neque fas esse existimant, ea literis mandare cum in reliquis Gr\u00e6cis utantur literis.

The great loss of Armorica, near unto us, by friend ship, by cognition, by interest, by correspondence. Corn wall has received princes from thence, and they from us. We had heretofore mutual interchanges of private families, but as to our speech we are alike careless. We can under stand words of one another, but have not the benefit of conferences with one another in our ancient tongue. I have met with some Friars born and bred there, who, one would think, should be able to discourse of their own pristine tongue, and of their own birthplaces, yet found them, though not totally ignorant that such things had been, yet insensible and careless of their former condi tion. They could tell me that my name Scawen, was in their tongue Elders, as here it is ; that there are those that bear the same name, and one of them a bishop ; but \u25a0when he writ it he changed it to Sambucus, shewing thereby a mind declared to a new, rather than an inclina tion to his old name, and relation to his country speech. IV. But, least the tender lamentations of those losses should be thought to put us out of memory of the loss of our tongue, the matter which we have in hand, we are here to mention a fourth cause, and that which most con cerns this Peninsula of Cornwall, which is the giving over of the Guirremears,t which were used at the great con ventions of the people, at which thev had famous interludes celebrated with great preparations, and not without shews of devotion J in them, solemnized in open and spacious downs of great capacity, encompassed about with earthen banks, and in some part stone work of largeness to con tain thousands, the shapes of which remain in many places at this day, though the use of them long since gone. * The two first lines are from Lib.

These were frequently used in most parts of the county, at the conveniency of the people, for their meeting toge ther, in which they represented, by grave actings, scrip tural histories, personating patriarchs, princes, and other persons ; and with great oratory pronounced their harangue, framed by art, and composed with heroic stile, such as have been known to be of old in other nations, as Gualterius,* an ancient father, hath been mentioned to be. This was a great means to keep in use the tongue with delight and admiration, and it continued also friendship and good correspondency in the people. They had reci tations in them poetical and divine, one of which I may suppose this small relique of antiquity to be, in which the passion of our Saviour, and his resurrection, is described. They had also their Carols at several times, especially at Christmas, which they solemnly sung, and sometimes used, as I have heard, in their churches after prayers, the burden of which songs, \" Nowell, Nowell, good news, good news of the Gospel,\" by which means they kept the use of the tongue the better. V. I cannot find that the British have boasted of many miracles done among them ; if any such antiently there were, they were deprived of the memory of them by the Romans. I cannot affirm with so much reason (as some of our neighbours have done with confidence) who say, that at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation of the citadel of Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein found, were those of Gogmagog, who was there said to be thrown down by Corineus, whom some will have to be the founder of the Cornish ;f nor am I able to assert, that some great instruments of war in brass, and huge limbs and portraitures of persons long ago, as some say that have been in some of the western parishes, were parts of giants, or other great men, who had formerly had their being there. But we may rather think those to be imaginary things or devices of old bards said to be there, though we have no certain memory of them neither. Nor may we think it strange that such things may be spoken of, since we may well credit some good historians, that * Gualterius, mentioned by Archbishop Laud in a speech in the Star Chamber. t These bones must evidently have been found in a Cavern, the nature of which has been most ably ascertained and described by Doctor Buckland; and the Rev.

VI. The sixth cause is, the loss of the ancient records, not of the Duchy or the Earldom of Cornwall, (which some affirm were burnt, and others lost in the ancient ruins of the castles of Rostormell, and other such,) but of those of whole Cornwall, whilst one of the four dynasties of this island, (or, as Pancirollus,) one of the five. VII. The seventh cause is desuetude, or want of a continued use ; and it is no wonder, if, after so many losses, the true use of the tongue vanished away or grew not into contempt. Speeches are compounded of words, and both of them of one nature, and continued according to their use, and of one of them it may be said as of the other Multa recensentur qu\u00e6 nunc cecidere, cadentque Qu\u00e6 nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus. Words many and tongues we recount, Which being fallen do oft remount, And those that are now priz'd by us, May fall to ground for want of use. VIIL A general stupidity maybe observed to be in the whole county. As to other matters monumental, there is little mention made of our antient stately fabrics amongst us, now ruinated ; as to the founders of them, castles, battles fought, and other things : and as to churches (though we have abundance of fair ones for so small a county, where there is no city nor any great town in it) excellent foundations, but who the builders were we have no intelligence, only a great many false tutelaries of them we hear of. Little of the monasteries hath been said by those that haye written copiously of others elsewhere. Scarcely anything of the ancient bishops here, or of the bishop's see ; only we know it to be said antiently, that it"], [697, "207 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. was removed from Bodmyn to St. German's,* and that it was about anno 1000, Danorum turbine, from a country more open, to a place more woodland. The cathedral in deed might have been better memorized by Godwin in his Catalogue of Bishops, and enumeration of all the bishopricks ; yet little is said of it or the four several chapels in several distinct places of the parish thereto belonging ; and as for the monastery nothing at all. It is strange too that Mr. Camden should say, \"Germani viculum nihil aliud est hodie, quam piscatorum casul\u00e6 : \" whereas, there are no such things belonging to such a trade there seen, but instead thereof a cathedral, main tained at the great cost of the inhabitants, (though a great part, by an accident, about one hundred years since fell down,) a good monastical house yet undemolished, and hospitably inhabited, to the relief of poor people. The bishop's seat and house are yet eminently extant in a Cornish name. The borough of St. German's enjoys still the privilege of sending burgesses to Parliament by pre scription. Pity it is that St. German, who came hither to suppress the Pelagian heresy, should have so bad a going off; for an old fable remains yet in report, that St. German being ill used fled away, leaving a sad curse behind him, to the cliffs at Rame near the head ; where bewailing his misfortunes, the compassionating rocks in the cliffs shed tears with him, at a place ever since called St. German's Well. True it is, such a spring there is, but the occasion of it cannot be more truly affirmed than the other part of the story that follows, viz. That he should be carried thence into remote countries byT angels in a fiery chariot, the tract of whose wheels were said to be seen in those cliffs, but they are invisible. Thus much for the site of the place. As to the person of St. German, who perhaps never saw the place, I need not turn over old fabulous legends, nor a better sort who have written his life hereto fore, but I may have liberty to relate what I have from the better hands of learned persons.f That besides his dis putation and confutation of Pelagius at Verulam, and thereby freeing the church and nation from those heresies by a public edict from the Emperor Valentinian, whereby they were no more troubled with them afterwards, he the * At St. German's, the place of the author's nativity, endowed by King Etheldred with lands, liberties, and privileges, but what or where non patet. t Archbishop Usher, in Primordiis.

Dubritius was made Archbishop of Carlehon ; Il tutus sent to Lan Iltut, a church bearing his name to this day ; and one Daniell, made Bishop of Bangor ; from these famous men the monastery of Bangor, and other monasteries in this land, were so well furnished with learned men, at the coming in of St. Austin from the Pope, they stood upon discreet and honourable terms. 2. The introduction of the Gallican Liturgy into use in the churches of Britany, which was ever different from the Romans, and thereby a happy means to have kept this nation from so much acquaintance with the Pope, as they had with him afterwards, to their great trouble. It is also said that St. Patrick, who carried over into Ireland the education monastic, and good principles therewith, and is held to be the Apostle of Ireland, spent many years under the discipline of St. German, when he came hither ; who, after he had been employed in the embassy to the Empe ror at Ravenna, died there one year before the Saxons' arrival. All this time we are left in the dark concerning the fabric of the Monastery of St. German's, which could not be built till two or three hundred years perhaps after the Saxons got a perfect dominion here over the land, but we may believe that that and the cathedral might be dedicated to his memory afterwards, in respect of the many good works he had done elsewhere. IX. As we have had an ill registry of monumental matters, so for five or six centuries past (before the two last), I doubt we had but few learned men here, which induces me to put that to the ninth cause of the decay of the Cornish tongue. After the suppression of the Druids, and that Christianity was received, yet learning decayed some while amongst the people, the best of them being carried abroad by the Romans and never returned ; and then the supposed Saints coming in after them, made no reparation thereof, but by their supposed miracles, with which they entertained the people. So they had very few learned men amongst them, places of breeding and obtain ing learning being remote, scarcely approachable, and the nation in continual troubles and dangers ; and for latter times such learned men as came to us, seeing our own neglect of our tongue, have thought it not fit to take the"], [699, "209 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. pains to inquire into it, as a thing obscure and not fit to be studied by them, and so suffered to decay insen sibly by them and the inhabitants. X. The Cornish tongue hath mostly resided for some ages past in the names of the people, the gentry chiefly, and in the names of places, observed to be significant mostly as to the site, &c. or for some things eminent about them. Concerning both these, I must take liberty to shew how the speech has been invaded, and eaten up by intrusion, much of which hath been about churches and their sites, as well as by neglectful inobservation ; for those Saxon saints have hungrily eaten up the antient names, which, when they could not well digest for hardness of the words, many catched up others from those whom they fieigned to be the tutelaries of those places, churches, and fountains, and supposed miracles wrought thereabouts, as St. Kaine, St. Gurrion, St. Tudy, St. Ive, St. Endellion, St. Kue, Landulph, St. Ust, St. Just, St. Marthren, &c. Of St. Mardren's Well,* (which is a parish west to the Mount) a fresh true story of two persons, both of them lame and decrepit, thus recovered from their infirmity. These two persons, after they had applied themselves to divers physicians and chirurgeons for cure, and finding no success by them, they resorted to St. Mardren's Well, and according to the ancient custom, which they had heard of, the same which was once in a year, to wit, on Corpus Christi evening, to lay some small offering on the altar there, and to lie on the ground all night, drink of the water there, and in the morning after, to take a good draught more, and to take and carry away some of the water, each of them in a bottle, at their departure. This course these tw*o men followed, and within three weeks they found the effect of it, and by degrees their strength increasing, were able to move themselves on crutches. The year following they take the same course again, after which they were able to go with the help of a stick ; and at length one of them, John Thomas, being a fisherman, was, and is able at this day, to follow his fishing craft. The other, whose name was William Cork, was a soldier * Bishop Hall, in his Mystery of Godliness, says, that a cripple, who for sixteen years together was fain to walk upon his hands, by reason the sinews of his legs were contracted, upon monitions in his dreams to wash in St. Mardren's Well, was suddenly so restored to his limbs, that he saw him both able to walk and get his own maintenance.

But herewith take also this: one Mr. Hutchens, a person well known in those parts, and now lately dead, being parson of Ludgvan, a near neighbouring parish to St. Mardren's Well, he observing that many of his parish ioners often frequented this well superstitiously, for which he reproved them privately, and sometimes publicly in his sermons ; but afterwards, lie the said Mr. Hutchens, meet ing with a woman coming from the well with a bottle in her hand, desired her earnestly that he might drink thereof, being then troubled with cholical pains, which accordingly he did, and was eased of his infirmity. The latter story is a full confutation of the former, for if the taking the water accidentally thus prevailed upon the party to his cure, as it is likely it did, then the miracle which was intended to be by the ceremony of lying on the ground and offering, is wholly fled, and it leaves the virtue of the water to be the true cause of the cure. And we have here, as in many places of the land, great variety of salutary springs, which have diversity of operations, which by natural reason have been found to be productive of good effects, and not by miracle, as the vain fancies of monks and friars have been exercised in heretofore. Howbeit, there are some old names yet remaining of places of prayers or oratories, and the ruins shewing them to be such, as V. Gr. Paderda, which is prayers good, (of which many places are so named) ; Eglarose, the church in the vale, supposed antienter than the names of their churches. Their sites are eminent and ancient, standing towards the east, though no mention made how they came to be in decay, but supposed to be after the Saxon churches came to be erected, and miracles supposed to be wrought by those whose names they bear. Churches' sites took new names, whereas the old Cornish names remain in all other places of the parishes generally ; yet the names of the four old castles remain, and of manors also for the most part, and some other things in she Cornish, and do so continue the better, by reason of men's particular inte rest in them : and so are the eminent hills likewise, espe cially towards the sea, and the hundred or hamlet names of the country remain so chiefly in the western parts ; those on the eastern, standing towards the borders, have their"], [701, "211 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. names wrested away by neighbourhood, as are other things by like accidents in the eastern parts of the county ; other names have been encroached upon by fantastical or vain- glorious builders calling their houses after their own names, and others upon vain toys ; but these are not many. More- over, concerning the loss of our speech, and the names of families, I must here (but tenderly though) blame the incu- riosity of some of our gentry; who, forsaking the etymologies of their own speech, have studied out new derivations of their names, endeavouring to make themselves as it were descended from French or Norman originals, in adopting or adapting their names thereunto ; whereas, their own names in the Cornish are more honourable, genuine, and true ; from the Conquest, forsooth, those would have their descent, (no illustrious thing in itself) whereas the ancestry of many of them have been here long before. How finely many have cozened themselves thereby, might be shewn, if it would not be offensively taken, by taking up of coat armour as from French originals. The art of heraldry hath been drawn out to us in French terms and trick- ings, mostly begun when our kings had most to do in those parts, and so from thence it hath continued ever since ; and our Cornish gentry, finding the English so much addicted thereunto, have followed in that tract the same mode, and would fain have themselves understood such, when they were much better before than those French or Latin terms could make them, in which many of the English may be blamed as well as we; for the herald's art hath many mysteries in it under their French and Latin terms, and many mistakes may be thereby to us and others who are not well acquainted with them, but in those that concern our own tongue, it is evident many have wronged themselves, and more may do so if not well heeded. The grounds of two mistakes are very obvious. 1st. Upon the Tre or Ter. 2dly. Upon the Ross or Rose. Tre or Ter in Cornish commonly signifies a town, or rather place, and it has always an adjunct with it. Tri is the number. 3. Those men willingly mistake one for another ; and so in French heraldry terms, they use to fancy and contrive those with any such three things as may be like or cohere with, or may be adapted to any thing or things in their surnames ; whether very handsome or not, is not much stood upon. Another usual mistake is upon Ross, i> 2"], [702, "212 SCAWEN's DISSERTATION which, as they seem to fancy, should be a rose ; but Ross in Cornish is a vale or valley. Now for this their French- Latin tutors, when they go into the field of Mars, put them in their coat armour prettily to smell out a rose or flower (a fading honour instead of a durable one) ; so any three such things, agreeable perhaps a little to their names, are taken up and retained from abroad, when their own at home have a much bttter scent and more lasting. Some, however, amongst us, have kept themselves bet ter to the antiquities of their Cornish names in their coat armour, as that honourable family Godolphin,* in keeping still displayed abroad his white eagle, from the Cornish Gothulgon. Richard, king of the Romans, Emperor elect, supplied his Cornish border with silver (perhaps tin) plates, deducing them from the antient earls of Cornwall, as borne by them before the Norman Conquest, and, in honour to them and himself, still bearing the same after wards. Chiverton, whose name in Cornish is a house on a green place or hill, he beareth a coat thereunto accordant, a castle with a green field under it; which may be well thought on as to the name in f Cornish, though, in the heraldry it had been more complete. V. a castle A. as I apprehend ; Scaberius, which is sweepers or sweeping, A. 3 broom besoms V. ; Gavergan, a goat ; Keverel, a he goat, or he-goats; that creature taking most delight, as it is observed, in the cliffs thereabout. These are better significations taken from home, than the other that are foreign ; and yet the assumption of a coat from any par ticular act of a man's own, is better than such as have reference barely to names, without some special significa tion therewith. I had thoughts formerly, and made preparation to give many more instances, where many amongst us have been mistaken in those two particulars ; but since it is a hard thing to convince men of old errors, and a harder to make a question against any concerning their gentelicions and the old forms thereof, though intended more for their honour, I shall forbear the further prosecution thereof; but in this, however, I shall do them right, that they, i. e. their ancestors, in this way thus trodden, have walked * Godolana-?, in the Ph\u0153nician, is a place of tin. f So Molenneck, signifying Goldfinches, a chevron Sable, between three goldfinches Proper."], [703, "ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. 213 generally as antiently as any other gentry of this nation, and to my seeming, it had been better if they had stood still super vias antiquas avorum suorum, since most of those ancient families who have strayed abroad as afore said, have yet some of them, and many more had, lands and places of their own names in their possession long enjoyed ; and a nearer passage it had been to their journey's end, viz. their honour, if they had not adventured abroad : a tes timony whereof we have in that great contention which happened in the time of King Edward III. between Car minow of this county (a family to which most of the ancient gentry here have relation) and a great person * of the nation, for bearing of one and the same coat armour, Azure, a bend Or. After many heats about it, a reference was made of it by the king to the most eminent Knights of that time, of which John of Gaunt, King of Castille, was one, before whom Carminow proved his right by the continual bearing thereof, and that before the Conquest, which was not disapproved nor disallowed, but applauded : yet, because the other contendant was a baron of the realm, Carminow was adjudged to bear the same coat still, but a file in chief for distinction sake. The decision was no way dishonourable, and the remembrance of the contention continued to the glory of his posterity, to which his motto in Cornish seems to have an allusion \u2014 in English, \"A Straw for Whifflers or Dissemblers;\" or as some have said to be, \"A Fig Cala Rag Whetlow ;\" but we may take the same better, I think, from the very name of Carminow being in Cornish a rock immoveable, as a sign of his resolution, from thence, or formerly taken up. Haying gone through this passage, which I know not how it may be taken by my countrymen, let me make this observation, that since the gentry here have thought fit, or endeavoured by mistake, to forsake the antiquity of their Cornish names, and thereby their greatest interest, might perhaps prognosticate that their language, which was their ancient glory, should in revenge forsake them, as now it hath almost done ; and I shall proceed to assign some other causes of the decay thereof. XI. The vicinity, or near neighbourhood with Devon. I may say that vicinity only with the Devonians, we hav ing none else, which next to the corruption of tongues by * Lord Scroope."], [704, "214 SC AW EN'S DISSERTATION time and superstition to saints, hath most devoured the names of places, especially on the borders of Cornwall with Devon ; and there is the worst language commonly spoken, and spoken rudely too, which corrupts not only their own country tongue but ours also, in the places that are nearest to them, and those infect others nearest to them. The names of the places are thereby also much altered in the Cornish, which antiently they had generally, and the par- ticulars that do yet appear, do stand as marks only to shew that what were formerly had are now much eaten away, on the borders especially. 'Tis observed also else- where in this county furthest west, where the Cornish hath been most spoken, that the English thereabouts is much better than the same is in Devon, or the places bordering on them, by being most remote from thence from whence the corruption proceeds. XII. Our gentry, and others, antiently kept themselves in their matches unmixt, commonly at home in their own country, both sons and daughters desiring much to do so, whereby they preserved their names here, and races the better; and when their names changed, it hath been observed to be to the places of their abode, sometimes willingly, sometimes by accident. So it hath continued the Cornish names to the places, and consequently the tongue. But indeed of late our gentry have frequently sought out foreign marriages in other counties, whereby, though it may be confessed they have brought in much wealth, and have goodly inheritances abroad, yet their offsprings have been dissipated, and their affection less intire to the county, the country-men, and country speech ; yet it is to be observed, that not many of them have been very prosperous or of long continuance in other counties, where they cannot muster up very many of our names of gentry, Prideaux, Trevilian, Tregonwell, Penruddock, and a few others excepted, which shews that our Cornish are like those trees that thrive best and live longest in their own peculiar soil and air, which yet is fruitful and durable to those that come in amongst us. Not only gentry, which are very many, that have great inheritance by their matches here with Cornish families, but many others also, which seldom leave this country when they have been planted here. XIII. The coming-in of strangers of all sorts upon us, artificers, traders, home-born and foreigners, whom our"], [705, "215 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. great commodities of tin (more profitable to others than ourselves) and fishing, have invited to us to converse with, and often to stay with us ; these all, as they could not easily learn our tongue, for which they could not find any guide or direction, especially in these latter days, nor the same generally spoken or affected amongst ourselves, so they were more apt and ready to let loose their own tongues to be commixed with ours, and such, for the novelty sake thereof, people were more ready to receive than to communicate ours to any improvement to them. But ministers in particular have much decreased the speech ; this country being far from academies, strangers from other parts of the kingdom have sought, as they still do, and have had their promotions here, where benefices are observed to be very good, and those have left their progenies, and thereby their names, remaining behind them, whereby the Cornish names have been diminished, as the tongue also : so that, as the reputed saints hereto- fore where they seated themselves, have robbed the places where their churches now stand for the most part of the Cornish names they had before, so the ministers since those times coming from other places, and other strangers, have filled up in many places the inhabitants and places here with their new names and titles brought amongst us, to the loss of many of the old. Here too we may add what wrong another sort of strangers have done to us, especially in the civil wars, and in particular by destroying of Mincamber, a famous monument, being a rock of infinite weight, which, as a burden, was laid upon other great stones, and yet so equally thereon poised up by nature only, as a little child could instantly move it, but no one man or many remove it. This natural monu- ment all travellers that came that way desired to be- hold; but in the time of Oliver's usurpation, when all monumental things became despicable, one Shrubsall, one of Oliver's heroes, then governor of Pendennes, by labour and much ado caused to be undermined and thrown down, to the great grief of tbe country, but to his own great glory as he thought, doing it as he said, with a small cane in his hand. I myself have heard him to boast of this act, being a prisoner then under him. XIV. Another cause I shall mention as a great loss of the tongue, though it be a great and wonderful advantage"], [706, "216 scawen's dissertation to the people otherwise : the orders of the church and state, commanding all the people young to learn the Lord's Prayer, Belief, &c. in the vulgar tongue, supposing that to be intended the English, if a mother, surely a stepmother to us. Younglings take in that most, and retain longest, wherewith thev are seasoned and bred up in their educa tion. Herein we must complain also of another new neglect to our speech, that the like care was not taken for us as for our brethren in Wales, in the making of the late act of Parliament for the uniformity of the Common Prayer, by which the five Bishops for Wales were commanded to see the Service Book to be printed in the Welch tongue. If it had been so here it had been a good counterpoise for the loss formerly mentioned concerning the young people ; this might also perhaps have saved us some labour in this our undertaking, and it would have been of good use for some of our* old folks also, for we have some among these few that do speak Cornish, who do not understand a word of English, as well as those in Wales, and those may be many in some of the western parts, to whom Mr. Francis Robinson, parson of Landawednack told me, he had preached a sermon not long since in the Cornish tongue, only well understood by his auditory. This should have been taken into consideration by our gentlemen burgesses in that and other Parliaments, and by our bishops also; but better it had been if our ancient bishops when they fled hither from their invaders, had brought with them a character of their ancient speech, or left books written therein ; or, in defect thereof, they or any other had done for us as Ulphius the bishop did for the Goths when they came to be seated in Italy, who there invented new Gothic letters for his people, and translated the Holy Scriptures into that language for them. This indeed had deserved * Amongst which, as one of the fresh antiquities of Cornwall, let not the old woman be forgotten, who died about two years since, who was 164 years old, of good memory, and healthful at that age, living in the parish of Gwi thian, by the charity mostly of such as came purposely to see her, speaking to them (in default of English) by an interpreter, yet partly understanding it. She married a second husband after she was SO, and buried him after he was 80 years of age. Her maiden name no one could remember, nor perhaps she herself. She was usually called after her two husbands' several names severally and sometimes together, as it is usual for the mealier sort of people to do. As for her maiden name, she might say with a wench in Petronius, \" Junonem meam iratam habeam si unquam meminerim me vir ginem fuisse.\""], [707, "217 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. our greatest thanks from our bishops, as no doubt they had them from those persons who received so great a benefit by their former and latter kindness therein ; nor let that good old bishop Ulphius be censured (as he seems to be) for doing a superfluous work, because he might perhaps know that the then service of the church was celebrated in the Greek and Latin tongues, but rather let him be commended for his zeal in religion, and his love to his country and to his country people then with him, dwelling with strangers in another land, that con- tinued so mindful of them and their speech, as we have been neglectful of ours. He by that means continued that tongue in use ; we by his example might have regained ours, if the like care had been taken ; but our people, as I have heard, in Queen Elizabeth's time, desired that the Com- mon Liturgy should be in the English tongue, to which they were then for novelty's sake affected, not out of true judgment desired it. But, besides negligence, fatality is to be considered ; fatality is a boundary beyond which no- thing can pass ; it hath been eminent in kingdoms and states, and those have had commonly fatal periods, as to a time determined five hundred years commonly. But more usual it is, that upon such mutations of kingdoms there have happened losses and mutations of tongues ; it may therefore be the more wondered at, that this of the British, being none of the learned tongues to which the Lord had intrusted the writing of his Sacred Scriptures, should have here lasted so long through so many muta- tions, and that there is yet such a record thereof, as our old manuscript imports, with the purity of the doctrine therein contained, and some other small things in the Bodleian Library. XV. The little or no help, rather discouragement, which the gentry and other people of our own have given in these latter days, who have lived in those parts where the tongue hath been in some use. In the time of the late unhappy civil war, we began to make some use of it upon the runnagates that went from us to the contrary part from our opposite works, and more we should have done if the enemy had not been jealous of them, and prevented us. This may be fit to be improved into somewhat, if the like occasion happen, for it may be talked freely and aloud to advantage, to which no other tongue hath reference. The poorest sort at this day, when they speak it as they come"], [708, "218 SCAWEn's DISSERTATION abroad, are laughed at by the rich that understand it not, which is by their own fault in not endeavouring after it. XVI. The want of writing it is the great cause of its decay ; for, though there wanted a proper character for it, yet we might have written it in the character now in use, but I never saw a letter written in it from one gentleman to another, or by any scholar ; which is to be wondered at, and blamed as a thing unbecoming such as ought to be studious in every thing that is ancient : but since I began to set about this work, I prevailed upon those that trans lated it to write me several letters, which they at first found very hard to be done ; but after some practice it seemed easier. Here I cannot but lament the want of such persons, books, records and papers, which were late in being, and not now to be had, and my misfortune in not having trans lated them, that most unhappily escaped me ; one was the manuscript of Anguin, who had translated out of Cornish into English his relations, after his decease, (having suits before me as Vice-Warden of the Stanneries for tin bounds) promised me the favour of those trans lations, but before their return to their houses, their people tearing all about for their controverted goods, had torn to pieces all those papers. In another place I was promised the sight of a Cornish Accidence ; but that by another such-like accident was totally spoiled by children before it could be brought me. I have heard also that a Matins in Cornish was amongst the books of Dr. Joseph Maynard, but I could never attain to it. But besides the no helps by which I lie in this labyrinth, I have likewise had discouragements amongst ourselves at home. I have been often told that, besides the difficulty of the attempt, it would be thought ridiculous for one to go about the restoring of that tongue which he himself could not speak nor understand truly when spoken, to which I have made answer with these two following in stances : one is of a countryman of ours, Langford by name ; who being blind was yet able to teach others the noble science of defence, only he desired to know still the length of the weapon of his fellow combatant, with a guess of his posture, and this he practised with good suc cess. The other is of one Grizling, of whom Mr. Cam den says, that he being deaf could see words ; that is, that notwithstanding his deafness he could answer any man's"], [709, "219 ON THE CORNISH TONGUE. question that set at table with him by the motion of his lips. This man I have seen also, and he would complain of such men as in those days wore great munchadoes, as they then called them, i. e. nourishing of much hair, by which he was hindered somewhat of the observation of their lips. I may place these two men, one blind, the other deaf, for these qualities among the observable things of the county, knowing them to be true, \u2014 if the mentioning these examples in their comparison do not excuse me from being laughed at by those men that have censured me for my attempt.

WILLIAM OF WORCESTER'S ITINERARY. As no account of William of Worcester is to be found in the common Biographical Dictionaries and Encyclope dias, it has been thought proper to prefix a short notice of his life and character to the following extract from his Itinerary : William was the son of William of Worcester, and of Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Bottoner. His sur name he took indifferently from either ; and he is con sequently sometimes denominated William Worcester, and William Bottoner. Bishop Tanner describes him as descended of a knightly family, but upon what evidence is not known ; yet from certain passages in the Itinerary his father would seem to have been a substantial house holder. He -was born in the parish of St. James at Bristol in the year 1415 ; and as he speaks of a stone vault in that city as having been built in 1428, at his own expense, it is pro bable that he lost his father, and came to his inheritance at a very early age. Of his childhood nothing is known ; but there is some reason to suppose that he was taught the rudiments of learning by Robert Lane, whom he has commemorated as a very eminent schoolmaster at Bris tol when he was a youth. In 1432 he first went to Ox ford, where he was admitted of Hart Hall, now Baliol College. It is said, that he was supported at the University by the celebrated Sir John Fastolf; the same who, in his own day, had great renown for his valour and munificence, and"], [713, "william of Worcester's itinerary. 223 who was afterwards exposed to dishonour by Shakspere, with a trifling variation of his name, and a considerable distortion of his character. But it may be presumed that Worcester was indebted not so much to his bounty as to his protection ; for if we may judge of Worcester's patri- mony from the few notices he has given us of his father's property in Bristol, it is not likely that his own means would have been inadequate to the small expense of a collegiate course in those simple times ; and we may therefore believe, that the connection which subsisted between Worcester and Fastolf, was merely a compliance with the general custom of the age, when y^ouths of gentlemanly birth and competent fortune sought the patronage and entered the household of wealthy and powerful men. But, however this might have been, it is certain that he afterwards lived with Sir John at Caister, in Norfolk, where he acted as the knight's secretary and confidential friend, and subsequently as one of his executors. At Oxford Worcester prosecuted his studies with great diligence and success ; and we are informed that he be- came eminent for his knowledge of history, medicine, and astronomy. On these subjects he is said to have written many books : yet it is likely thatthey were rather extracts and memorandums, than original and formal compositions. Besides these, he executed some translations from the classics ; and we learn from his Itinerary, that on the tenth of August 1473, he presented the Bishop of Win- chester with a translation of Cicero on Old Age. He tells us, however, that this gift was not sufficient to conciliate the good prelate's regard ; but he seems to insinuate, that the failure was owing less to the faults of the performance, than to the intervention of an enemy. Yet, whatever he might have suffered from the malice of his neighbours, it is possible, that the offering itself was considered of small value; and it might have been the less esteemed, if it be true, that the same treatise had been already rendered into English by John Tiptoft, the accomplished and unfortu nate Earl of Worcester. But it is on very slender evidence that this nobleman is said to have translated Cicero on Old Age. He had left in manuscript a translation of Cicero on Friendship ; and when Caxton printed it, many years after his death, with an anonymous version of the essay on Old Age, in the same volume, he was at once supposed to hare been the"], [714, "224 william of Worcester's itinerary. author of both ; but the translation, thus published with out a name, was professedly executed in honour of Sir John Fastolf, the friend and patron of AVilliam of Wor cester ; and as it is well known that many of his depend ant's literary performances were undertaken expressly for his sake, and, as at the same time William of Worcester might have been easily confounded with the Earl of Wor cester, there is considerable probability that William, and not the Earl, was the author of the translation in ques tion, and consequently William could not have suffered on a comparison with him in the manner suggested. Nor is it sufficient objection to this inference, that the produc tions of a writer, whose style has been chosen as an ex ample of the barbarous taste of the age in which he lived, were not likely to be imputed to one whose extraordinary attainments had won the admiration of the polished and fastidious scholars of Italy ; for whatever might have been the Earl's superiority in classical knowledge, it does not appear that he had cultivated his native tongue with greater care than his contemporaries ; and William of Worcester might not have fallen below him in the rude and unsettled English of that time. Of William's writings, of whatever kind, very little is now extant ; and though for a few things the credit which he deserved has been given to others, it has been reason ably conjectured, that he has enjoyed in return the merit of some performances of which he was not the author ; but however he might have laboured in the promotion of learning, he loved the acquisition of it so well, that he was accustomed to say, he found more pleasure in his books than some men derived from their estates ; and to the attainments which he had made at the University, he added, by the help of one Giles, a Lombard, some ac quaintance with French and Poetry. Yet study was insufficient to satisfy him without ob servation: ro eibevai birrov eXeyev eivai' ro pev e-n-Km/sUi), rb be rij ireipi}. He consequently sought to enlarge his know ledge by travelling; and he has been considered worthy of respect as the earliest topographer of England, **** Primum Angli\u00e6 perlustratorem ne flocci facias ;\" but however this may be, he is certainly the first traveller who has left us any memorials of a journey into Cornwall ; and the inte rest and value which his observations derive from this"], [715, "william of Worcester's itinerary. 225 circumstance, have made them worthy of a place in the present Appendix. The book, in which these notices are found, is entitled Itinerarium, sive Liber Rerum Memorabilium Willelmi Botoner diet, de Worcester. It had existed in manuscript only, till the year 1778, when it was published at Cam bridge, from the original autograph in the Library of Corpus Christi College, by James Nasmith, formerly a Fellow of that Society. Besides this, indeed, there is another manuscript of the journal in the same library, but it is only a copy of the former, made by the procure ment of Archbishop Parker ; and as it is very incorrect, it is of no value in itself, and could have been of little use to the editor. This Itinerary seems to have been a memorandum book, which the author kept with him on his journeys, not only into this county, but to other parts of this kingdom ; and accordingly we find it stored with desultory notices of separate facts, and distant places, and abounding with trifling and unconnected observations, which seem to have been associated on the same page, only as the book was accidentally opened, and recorded rather from some pre- sent impulse, than with any settled and ultimate design. Nothing can be more rude than the style, or more worth- less than many of the statements ; and whatever might have been the writer's real intention, it is very certain that his remarks, in the condition which they have actually come down to us, could not have been meant for publica- tion. It might have been his purpose, when leisure and opportunity should serve, to arrange and expand the hasty and unconnected notes thus made by the way; but the brevity of the greater number would have insufficiently secured him against perplexities and mistakes ; and as he might have erred occasionally through the acknowledged failure of his memory, or the unconscious influence of his imagination, it is possible that a careful and regular composition subsequently made, might have been less useful, than even the confused and scanty memorandums we possess. Worcester came into Cornwall in the year 1478. Mr. Whitaker says, that it was in 1440. How he could have committed such a mistake, it is difficult to conceive, as the date is expressly recorded in the Itinerary itself. Mr. Polwhele, indeed, appears to have erred likewise ; for, VOL. IV. Q"], [716, "william of Worcester's itinerary. 226 according to him, William's journey was performed in 1473 ; but this is evidently nothing more than a misprint. In one of our county histories, the journey is stated to have occurred in 1460: it is probable, however, that the writer had never seen the Itinerary. He set out from Norwich, on Monday the 1 7th of August, and reached London on the Thursday following. On the first of September he came to Bristol, and took his departure for Cornwall on the next day. He arrived at Launceston on Sunday the 13th, and on Monday pur sued his journey towards the west. Near Bodmin his horse fell with him, but it does not appear that he received any injury. On Tuesday night he slept at Polwhele ; and having visited the preaching friars at Truro on Wednes day, he came in the evening to Marazion. The next morning, Thursday 1 7th of September 1478, he attended mass in the chapel on the Mount. In the afternoon of the same day, he departed for Penryn ; and going thence to Bodmin, he returned eastward, through the towns on the south coast. The towns and villages on the north coast of Cornwall he did not visit ; and the statements which he makes respecting them, were merely the result of his inquiries. He seems, indeed, to have been as diligent in seeking information from others, as in making observations of his own ; and no persons, whether smiths, ropers, or ferrymen, were considered unfit to furnish him with the knowledge which he wanted for his journal. Amongst those in Cornwall, from whom he learned most, was his cousin, Robert Bracey, at Fowey ; but it is likely that he depended mainly upon the secular .and regular clergy, who entertained him on the road, and gave him access to their chronicles and registers. With regard to the nature and purpose of this journey, from the manner of the record itself, it would not be easy to conjecture, whether it was undertaken with feelings of devotion or of curiosity. The coldness of the whole narrative, and the careless brevity with which the accom plishment of the acknowledged object is related, were scarcely consistent with a fervid and lively devotion ; and the insertion of so many facts and observations, which must have been useless when they were written, and now owe their value to their subsequent antiquity, while the documents of early times, and the traditions of the people, were almost wholly neglected, could not have happened"], [717, "william of Worcester's itinerary. 227 under the influence of an active and judicious curiosity. And besides this, when William of Worcester was in Cornwall, it was impossible for an intelligent visitor to overlook the state of our ecclesiastical architecture. Many of our present churches had been recently built, and others were then building ; and some account of their style and condition, of their founders and builders, and of the circumstances attending their erection, would have been far more amusing to his contemporaries than what he wrote, and of unspeakable interest in after times. And any other man, we may suppose, would have found some- thing to say of the manners and habits of the people, and of their mines and fisheries ; but from William of Wor- cester we know only by implication or accident, that he travelled in an inhabited country. Yet without devotion he would not have visited the Mount, and without curiosity he would have made no observations by the way. The shrine of St. Michael, which had been the resort of superstitious people in remote times, had lately recovered its ancient reputation, after an interval of some accidental obscurity ; and pil- grims were again attracted by the privileges conferred on it in the eleventh century, and were coming even from distant places in considerable numbers. William of Wor- cester was one of these ; and as his penitence had brought him so far, it might be thought that his admiration would have delayed his return. But the hospitalities of a place so ' kind to strangers,' the natural beauties of the Mount, and the venerable antiquity and romantic traditions of the castle and monas- tery, were not enough to detain him for a day ; and with scarcely any regard to such things, he stayed but a few hours. In that short space he could not occupy himself with many inquiries ; and we have received from him only a few bare facts, which he appears to have recorded rather as the justification of his pilgrimage, than with any precise knowledge of their value. His subsequent pursuits, and the time of his death, are not known, nor have we any account of the number and the fortunes of his children. It is certain, however, that he was married ; and he is reported to have taken a wife in opposition to the wishes of his patron. For Sir John Fastolf had designed for him some ecclesiastical prefer ment, and had consequently advised him to obtain orders Q 2"], [718, "228 WILLIAM OF WORCESTER S ITINERARY. in the church.

VII. THE ITINERARY OF JOHN LELAND, SO FAR AS RELATES TO CORNWALL. (Hearne's Edition, vol. II. fol. 69.J From Depeford to Lanstoun a xij miles by hilly and much morisch groude baren of wodde. Or ever I cam to Lanstoun by a mile I passid over a bridge of stone, having 3 arches and a [one] smaul, caullid New Bridge ; thorough the which the ryver of Tamar rennith, that almost from the hed of it to the mouth devidith Devonshir from Cornewaule. This New Bridge was of the making of the Abbates of Tavestok, and mainteinyd by them ; for Taves toke Abbay had fair possessions thereaboute. The Ryver of Tamar risith a 3 miles by north-est from Hertelande and thens cummith to Tamerton, a village on the est ripe yn Devonshire ; and ther is a bridg over Tamar of stone : and from this bridg to Padestow xx miles. Yalme Bridge of stone 2 miles lower. New Bridge 2 miles lower. Pulstun Bridge 2 miles lower. Greistoun Bridge a 2 miles or more lower. Tavestoke about a 4 miles from Greston Bridg ; and Grestoun Bridg, being about a 3 miles from Launston, is the way from Launston to Tavestok. Hawte Bridg. Another bridg caullid New Bridg. Caulstoke Bridg next the se, begon by Sir Perse Eggecumbe. Lideford Bridge is not on Tamar. After that I had enterid a litle into the suburbe of Launstoun, I passed over a brooke caullid Aterey, that rennith yn the botom of the stepe hil that Launstoun"], [747, "leland's itinerary. 257 stondith on. This water, as I there lernid, riseth a x miles of by west-north-west towards Bodmyne ; and, passing by Launstoun, goith in Tamar by est, as I did gather, a litle above Pulston Bridg. After that I had passid over Aterey, I went up by the Lille thorough the long suburbe, ontylle I cam to the toun waul and gate, and so passid thorough the toun, conscending the hill ontylle I cam to the very top of it, wher the market- place and the paroche chirch of S. Stephane, lately re- edified, be. The large and auncient Castelle of Launston stondith on the knappe of the hill, by south a litle from the paroche chirch. Much of this castel yet stondith ; and the moles that the kepe stondith on is large and of a ter- rible highth, and the arx of it, having 3 severale wardes, is the strongest but not the biggest that ever I saw in any auncient worke in Englande. Thir is a litle pirle of water that servith the high parte of Lanstoun. The Priorie of Launstoun stondith in the south- westparte of the suburbe of the toun, under the rote of the hille, by a fair wood side ; and thorowgh this wood rennith a pirle of water, cumming out of an hil therby, and servith al the offices of the place. In the chirch I markid 2 notable tumbes, one of Prior Horton, and another of Prior Ste- phane. One also told me there, that one Mabilia, a Countes, was buried ther in the Chapitre House. One William Warwist, Bishop of Excestre, erected this Priorie, and was after buried at Plymtoun Priory that he also erected. Warwist, for erection of Launston Priory, sup- pressid a collegiate Chirch of S. Stephan having Preben- daries, and gave the best part of the landes of it to Laun- stoun Priory, and toke the residew hymself. There yet standith a Chirch of S. Stephan, about half a mile from Launstoun on a hille, wher the Collegiate Chirch was. Gawen Carow hath the custody of the Priory. There is a Chapelle by a west-north-west a litle without Launs- towne, dedicate to S. Catarine ; it is now prophanid. From Launston to Botreaux Castelle, vulgo Boscastel, first a -2 miles by enclosid ground having sum woodde and good corne. Thens an 8 miles by morisch and hilly ground and great scarsite of wood, insomuch that al the countery therabout brennith firres and hethe. And thens a 2 miles to Boscastel by enclosid ground metely fruteful of corne, but exceding baren of wood, to the which the bleke northern se is not there of nature favorable. The vol. iv. s"], [748, "leland's itinerary. 258 toun of Boscastelle lyith apon the brow of a rokky hille by south-est, and so goith doun by lenght to the northe toward the se, but not even fui hard to it. It is a very filthy toun and il kept. There is a chirch in it, as I re membre of S. Simpherian. The Lorde Botreaux was lord of this town, a man of an old Cornish linage, and had a manor place, a thing, as far as I could of smaul reputation, as it is now, far onworthe the name of a castel. The people ther caulle it the Courte. Ther cummith down a little broke from south-est out of the hilles therov, and so renning by the west side of the towne, goeth into Severn se betwixt 2 hylles, and ther maketh a pore havenet, but of no certaine salvegarde. One of the Hungrefordes maried with one of the heires ge nerale of Botreaux, and so Boscastel cam to Hungreford. Then cam Boscastelle, by an heir generale of the Hungre fords, unto the Lord Hastinges. Hastinges Erie of Hun tendune and the late lord Hungreford had a lordship of the Botreaux in partition, caullid Parke; and ther is a manor place or castelet. It is a vi miles from Botreaux by south. Ther is no very notable toun or building from Bo treaux by est-north-est, along apon the shore upper on Severn to Hertland point, but Strettoun, and that is a xij miles from Botreaux, and ther is a praty market. It stondith about a mile from the se. There is a place near to Stretton caullid Ebbingford, but now communely Efford, wher John Arundale of Trerise was borne, and hath a fair manor place, in the which Syr John Chaumon now dwellith, that maried the mother yet lyving of John Arundale of Trerise. Olde Treviiiane, a man of pratie land, but cumming of a younger brother of the chife house of that name, dwel lith toward Stretton, at a place caullid Hertland Point is a x miles upper on Severn from Strettoun. From Botreaux to Tredeivy village, on the shore about a mile, and ther cummith downe a broke rising in the gret rokky hilles therby. From Tredewi to Bossinny, on the shore about a mile. This Bossinny hath beene a bygge thing for a fischar town, and hath great privileges grauntid onto it. A man may se there the ruines of a gret numbre of houses. Here also cummith down a broke, and this broke and Tredewy water resort to the se at one mouth betwyxt ij hilles,"], [749, "leland's itinerary. 259 wherof that that is on the est side, lyith out lyke an arme or cape, and maketh the fascion of an havenet or pere, whither shippelettes sumtime resorte for socour. A frere of late dayes toke apon hym to make an haven at this place, but he litle prevailid theryn. There ly 2 blake rokkes as islettes at the west-north-west point or side of this creeke ; the one, saving a gut of water, joyning to the other. And yn these brede guiles, be al lykelihod. From Bossinny to Tintagel Castel on the shore a mile. This castelle hath bene a riarvelus strong and notable forteres, and almost situ loci inexpugnabile, especially for the dungeon, that is on a great and high terrible cragge, environid with the se ; but having a drawbridge from the the residew of the castelle onto it. There is yet a chapel standing withyn this dungeon of S. Ulette, alias Uliane. Shepe now fede within the dungeon. The residew of the buildings of the castel be sore wether-beten and yn ruine ; but it hath beene a large thinge. This castelle stondith in the paroche of Trevenny ; and the paroch therof is of S. Simphorian, ther caullid Simiferian. Passing a mile from the chirch of S. Symphorian by hilly and hethy ground, I cam over a brooke that ran from south-est-north to Severn se, and about half a mile be- yound the mouth of this brook lay a great blak rok like an islet yn the se not far from the shore. Porthissek, a fisschar village, lyith about a 3 miles from the mouth of th'afore sayd brook, lower by west on Severn shore. There resortith a broke to Porthissek, and there is a pere and sum socour for fisschar botes. Porthguin, a fisschar village, lyith a 2 miles lower on the shore, and there is the issue of a broke and a pere. And a 3 miles lower is the mouth of Padestow Haven. From Dindagelle to S. Esse village a 4 miles ; meately good ground about S. Esses seise. From S. Esse to Trelille village 2 miles. From Trelille to wher Master Carniovies, alias Carnsey, hath a praty house, fair ground, and praty wood about it. Thens 3 miles by good corne grounde, but no wood, to Wadebridge. Wher as now Wadebridge is, ther was a fery a 80 yeres syns, and menne sumtyme passing over by horse, stoode often in great jeopardie. Then one Lovebone, vicar of Wadebridge, movid with pitie, began the bridge, and with great paine and studie, good people putting their help thereto, finishid it with s 2"], [750, "260 leland's itinerary. xvij fair and great uniforme arches of stone. One told me that the fundation of certein of tharches was first sette on so quick sandy ground that Lovebone almost despairid to performe the bridg ontyl such tyme as he layed pakkes of wolle for fundation. The ryver of Alawne rennith thorough Wadebridge, evidentley seen at lower. The first memorable bridge on Alane is caullid Helham Bridge . . . miles lower then Camilforde, but Alane is almost a mile from Camilford Toun. Dunmere Bridge of 3 arches a 2 nfiles lower. Here doth iUaune ryver ren within a mile of Bodmyn. Wadebridge a 3 miles lower by land and 4 by water. This is the lowest bridg on Alane. Ther cummith a broke from S. Esse 5 myles from Wadebridge, and a litle above Wadebridge goith into Alane by the est side of the haven. This broke risith a 2 miles above S. Esse by est-north-est. There cummith a brooke from Mr. Carnsey's house, and goith into Alane, by the est side of the haven a 3 mdes lower than Wade bridge : and here is a creeke at the mouth of this brooke that ebbith and flowith up into the land. In the way passing from Dunmere Bridge toward Bod myn, there rennith a praty broket thoroug a bridge of one stone arche, a very litle wayT beyond Dunmer Bridge : and a litle lower goith into Alane bynethe Dunmer Bridge by the west ripe of Alane. This litle broke servith the milles, and rennith by the est ende of the town of Bodmyn. There cummith a brooke into Alaune about a 2 miles byneth Dunmere bridg on the west ripe. This brooke riseth by south-est : and at S. Lawrence, scant a mile owt of Bodmyn, I passid over a bridge on this water in the way to Michale. From Wadebridge to Padestow, a good quick fischar toun but onclenly kepte, a 4 miles.

The showe and the principale of the toun of Bodmyn is from west to est along in one streate. There is a chapel of S .... at the west ende of the toune. The paroch chirch standith at the est end of the town and is a fair large thyng. There is a cantuarie chapel at th'est ende of it. The late Priory of Blake Chanons stoode at the est ende of the paroch chirch yard of Bodmyne. S. Petrocus was Patrone of this, and sumtyme dwellyd ther. There hath bene monkes, then nunnys, then seculare presses, then monkes agayn, and last canons regular, in S. Petrokes chirch. Willyam Warlewist, Bishop of Excestre, erectid the last fundation of this Priory ; and had to hymself part of th'auncient landes of Bodmyn monasterie. I saw no tumbes in the Priory very notable, but Thomas Vivianes, late Prior ther, and Suffra- gane by the title of the Bishoprike of Megarensis.* The Shrine and Tumbe of S. Petrok yet stondith in th'est part of the chirche. There was a good place of Gray Freres in the south side of Bodmyn town. One John of London, a merchaunt, was the beginner of this house. Edmund Erie of Cornewaul augmentid it. There lay buried in the Gray Freres Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas Peverelle, knightes, and benefactors to the house. There is another Chapel in Bodmyn beside that in the west ende of the toune, and an Almose House, but not endowid with landes. From Bodmyn to \u00abS'. Laurence, wher a poor Hospital or Lazar House is, about a mile. One of the Peverelles gave a litle annuitie onto this house. Here I passid over a stone bridge, and under it rennith a praty broke that cummith out of the hylles from south-este, and goith into Alane a 2 miles above Padestow by the weste ripe, and by the meanes of the se and creke it ebbith and flowith up into the creke of this river. From S. Laurence I passed by morisch ground al baren of woodde a vj m[iles], leving about this vj miles ende S.

This Arundale ys caullid Arundale of Trerise, by a difference from Arundale of Lanheron. Trerise is a lordship of his, a 3 or 4 miles from Alein chirch.

DRAYTON'S POLY-OLBION.\u2014 CORNWALL. Michael Drayton was born of a gentleman's family in Warwickshire in the year 1563. His ancestors are said to have migrated from Drayton in Lancashire. Michael exhibited a strong genius for poetry at an early age. He studied at Oxford, but without taking a degree. In 1588 he appears to have served in a military capa city ; as he describes the glorious victory over the Invin cible Armada, as seen by himself from the shore near Dover. He died in 1631, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Drayton was a very voluminous writer of Poetry. We have from him \u2014 Heroic Epistles after the model of Ovid. The Barons' Wars in the Reign of Edward the Second. The Battle of Agincourt. The Shepherd's Garland. Elegies. The Man in the Moon, the Owl, Odes, and various other small Poems. But his greatest work is the Poly-Olbion, in twenty Cantos or Songs, of which the first is here given, with the Author's Notes or Illustrations, as it contains a de scription of Cornwall, commencing with a Dialogue between St. Michael's Mount and the Bar of Hayle, which"], [784, "294 drayton's poly-oi.bion. must have passed immediately over Tredrea the Editor's House. The singular title of his great work is derived from the Greek TioXvs many and also very ; and OA/3ios happy ; some neuter substantive understood, perhaps the Latin Rcgnum ; and founded on one of the idle fancies current in the middle ages, which derived Albion (a name of this island) in some way or another from OXfiibs. Michael Drayton commences his national poem with the western point of the Country, and his First Song is as follows : THE ARGUMENT. The sprightly Muse her wing displays, And the French islands first surveys ; Bears up with Neptune, and in glory Transcends proud Comical' s promontory ; Tliere crowns Mount-Michael, and descries How all those river et s fall and rise ; Then takes in Tamer, as she bounds The Cornish and Devonian grounds. And whilst the Dev'nshire nymphs relate Their loves, their fortunes, and estate, Dert undertaketh to revive Our Brute, and sings his first arrive- Then northward to the verge she bends, And her first song at Ax she ends. Of Albion's glorious isle the wonders whilst I write, The sundry varying soils, the pleasures infinite, (Where heat kills not the cold, nor cold expells the heat, The calms too mildly small, nor winds too roughly great, Nor night doth hinder day, nor day the night doth wrong, The summer not too short, the winter not too long,) What help shall I invoke to aid my muse the while ? Thou Genius of the place (this most renowned isle)"], [785, "drayton's poly-olbion. 295 Which lived'st long before the all-earth-drowning flood, Whilst yet the world did swarm with her gigantic brood, Go thou before me still thy circling shores about, And in this wand'ring maze help to conduct me out : Direct my course so right, as -with thy hand to show Which way thy forests range, which way thy rivers flow ; Wise Genius, by thy help that so I may descry How thy fair mountains stand, and how thy vallies lie ; From those clear pearly cliffs which see the morning's pride, And check the surly imps of Neptune when they chide, Unto the big- swoln waves in thea Iberian stream, Where Titan still unyokes his fiery-hoofed team, And oft his flaming locks in luscious nectar steeps, When from Olympus' top he plungeth in the deeps : That fromb th' Armoric sands, on surging- Neptune's leas, Through the Hibernic gulf (those rough Vergivian seas) My verse with wings of skill may fly a lofty gait, As Amphitrite clips this island fortunate, Till through the sleepy main to c Th uly I have gone, And seen the frozen isles, the cold d Deucalidon, Amongst whose iron rocks grim sSaturn yet remains, Bound in those gloomy caves with adamantine chains.

' If credulous too much, thereby th' offended heaven, ** In their devout intents yet be their sins forgiven.' Then from his rugged top the tears down trickling fell ; And in his passion stirr'd, again began to tell Strange things, that in his days time's course had brought to pass : That forty miles now sea, sometimes firm fore-land was ; And that a forest then, whicl now with him is flood, Whereof he first was call'd the Hoar-rock in the wood ; Relating then how long this soil had laid forlorn, As that her Genius now had almost her forsworn, And of their ancient love did utterly repent, Sith to destroy herself that fatal tool she lent, To which th' insatiate slave her intrails out doth draw, That thrusts his gripple hand into her golden maw ; And for his part doth wish, that it were in his pow'r To let the ocean in, her wholly to devour. Which Hayle doth overhear, and much doth blame his rage, And told him (to his teeth) he doated with his age. For Hayle (a lusty nymph, bent all to amorous play, And having quick recourse into the Severn sea, With Neptune's pages oft disporting in the deep ; One never touch'd with care, but how herself to keep In excellent estate) doth thus again intreat ; ' Muse, leave the wayward Mount to his distemper'd heat, ' Who nothing can produce but what doth taste of spight, ' I'll shew thee things of ours most worthy thy delight.

But the laborious muse, upon her journeyr prest, Thus uttereth to herself ; ' To guide my course aright, *\u25a0 What mound or steddy mere is offered to my sight, ' Upon this out-strecht arm, -whilst sailing here at ease, ' Betwixt the southern waste, and the Sabrinian seas, ' I view those wanton brooks, that waxing still do wane ; ' That scarcely can conceive, but brought to bed again ; ' Scarce rising from the spring, (that is their natural mother) ' To grow into a stream, but buried in another.' When Chore doth call her on, that wholly doth betake Herself unto the Loo ; transform'd into a lake, Through that impatient love she had to entertain The lustful Neptune oft ; whom when his wracks restrain, Impatient of the wrong, impetuously he raves : And in his rageful flow, the furious King of waves Breaks foaming o'er the beach, whom nothing seems to cool, Till he have wrought his will on that capacious pool : Where Menedge, by his brooks, a k chersonese is cast, Widening the slender shore to ease it in the waste ; A promont jutting out into the dropping south, That with his threatning cbffs in horrid Neptune's mouth, Derides him and his po'w'r : nor cares how him he greets.

Hingston, Esq. M.D.) It is commonly understood, that those places in Corn wall, which have the word San or Saint as the antecedent component of their names, are so denominated after some martyr or confessor of early times. This is a very obvious and indisputable fact. But it is by no means certain, that in every instance of the kind, the saint conferred his name on the place : for in many cases, the converse seems to have been practised ; and contrary to what is generally imagined, I believe that the place bestowed its name on the saint. Thus, for example, in St. Stephen, and St. Allan, two saints are equally commemorated ; but Ste phen, by his own name, which he possessed independ ently of accidental circumstances ; and .Allan, by a name, superseding that which he had received at his baptism, and subsequently derived from the place of his retirement. The want of this distinction has occasioned unspeakable labour and perplexity in the investigation of Cornish antiquities. Books and documents have been examined, and enquiries made in vain, after names, of which no record exists ; and which, even in their own day, were scarcely known beyond the narrow district, in which they were venerated. In some instances, indeed, the objects of such researches might have been illustrious before their retirement ; but if, in that case, their acts and sufferings were chronicled, the history was in effect abolished, when their identity was lost in the assumption of a new name. Thus many of our early saints took refuge here, from the persecutions, to which the Christian faith was exposed"], [803, "313 CORNISH NAMES. in Ireland ; and their history has been chiefly sought in the hagiographies of that country. But the greater num ber of them, on coining into Cornwall, complied with this custom, common, indeed, with all men at that time, of changing the name with the residence ; and accordingly, instead of that, by which they had been formerly known, and might have been recorded, they adopted or received another, as choice or accident determined their settlement. Hence we have St. Hy, or St. Id, the Island-saint; St. Uny, (or perhaps more correctly St. Unan) the Down-saint ; St. Dennis, the Hill- saint; St. Allan, the Moor- saint. But not only have these, and similar appellations, been erroneously regarded as the baptismal and proper names of the saints, whom they commemorate ; but the acci dental corruption of some of them has led to still greater mistakes ; and from the mere coincidence of sound, the saint whose memory was to be preserved, has been iden tified with some other person, for whom that honour could not have been intended. Thus the town of St. I's, or with the genitive at full length, as it was commonly written, St. les, has for many generations been called St. Ives, though the correct form was frequently used till the close of the seventeenth century. In consequence of this corruption, the place has been said to have derived its name from some bishop Ivo, either the Persian, who gave his name to St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire, or the cele brated Ivo, bishop of Chartres. But St. I was a female from Ireland. The case of St. Dennis seems to be of the same kind ; though in that instance the error is not owing to a corrup tion of the name, but to the similarity of the sound. St. Dennis signifies the Saint on the Hill, or more strictly, the Hill-saint ; and the church stands at this day on the summit of a hill. But the good man, yvho lived there, has been considered the same person as St. Dionysius, or St. Dennis, the areopagite. I cannot help suspecting, that some error of this sort has occurred in the case of Paul- parish near Penzance, yvhich is reported to have taken its name from St. Paul de Leon. Now that portion of the Mount's bay, by which this parish is bounded on the east, is called The Lake ; and this lake, which might have been correctly so deno minated in ancient times, is at the foot of the hill, on which the present church stands; and it is, therefore,"], [804, "314 CORNISH NAMES. probable that some man of eminent piety once resided near it. In that case, he was called the Lake-saint, which rendered into Cornish, becomes St. Pol. For this reason, I believe that the common account is wholly untrue ; and that, as in many other instances, the name of the saint, and through him, of the parish, originated entirely in a local accident. I may state here, that some parishes have a popular name, arising not unfrequently from very trifling circum stances ; and this name has, in some cases, entirely super seded the more legitimate denomination, under which the church was consecrated and registered. Thus, to give one example, the parish at the Lizard is called Landuwednac, which signifies the Black-and-ivhite-church. This appella tion was suggested by the peculiar appearance of the church and tower, -which are built of black and white stones, arranged alternately, in the manner of a chess board. Amongst the names of our Cornish towns, there are three remarkable above the rest for having been very dili gently examined, and very httle understood. Upon these it may be proper to make a few observations. Of Truro Tonkin says, that ** it is so called from its three principal streets ; for Tri, three, and Ru, a street, have been turned to Truro merely euphoni\u00e6 gratia.' Tonkin ought to have suspected, that Tri, occurring as the first syllable in the name of a town, was not likely to mean three, because Tri or Tre signifies a dwelling place, or an assemblage of dwellings, and therefore, a town. He might have supposed too, that the place was called Truro, before its three principal streets were built, or designed ; since it does not appear to have ever had any other name, and we cannot believe, that it was so denominated by anticipation. For in those rude times, towns were not commonly laid out upon a definite plan : but the houses were erected according to the taste or convenience of the budders ; and the streets seem to have been formed, almost as accident might determine. But Whitaker says, that Tonkin's etymology, which was adopted from Camden, is altogether absurd ; and he consequently undertakes to find a better. For this pur pose he assumes, that Truro takes its name from its castle. Now he imagines, that the castle was denominated Treve reu, and that the name was subsequently familiarized to Treuro. In that way, he thinks, the etymon at once pre-"], [805, "315 CORNISH NAMES. sents itself; and we are accordingly informed, that Truro signifies the castle on the Uro. This, however, is to take a course the reverse of that pursued by etymologists in general : for they seek the meaning of a word in its primi tive form, but Mr. Whitaker in its corruption. There is also another objection, which may be considered equally conclusive ; for, as Mr. Polwhele says, we have no such river in Cornwall as the Uro. Mr. Polwhele himself has proposed a third explanation, which, however ingenious, I think equally unsatisfactory. He suggests, that Truro may be a town of Roman origin ; and that the name is a corruption of Trevorou, the town on-the-ways. But if it were so, we should not be wholly without any evidence of the fact. Proof would be found in some obscure tradition, some historical record, or some local circumstance ; and the name itself, upon which alone this opinion is grounded, yvould be more completely con sistent with it. When the Romans founded a town, it was not their custom to give it a name exhibiting no trace of their own language ; but Truro is unquestionably Corn ish ; and besides that, as persons skilled in such matters would easily see, it is no very natural corruption of Tre vorou. Polwh. Hist, of Cornwall, vol. i, p. 189; vol. ii, p. 215. Yet that it is a corruption, is certain. In the charter granted by Reginald Fitzroy, in the reign of Henry II. the name of the town is written Trivereu. It is of this word, therefore, that Truro is a corruption ; and if we can determine its signification, we shall ascertain the etymon of Truro. Now nothing can be better known, than that Rivereu, or Rivero, in the ancient language of this county, had the same meaning as the kindred word rivers, in English : and with regard to the initial T, it can be scarcely necessary to say, that it stands for Tre, or its archaic form Te, a town. The word, therefore, in the primitive and proper mode of writing it, is Trerivero ; and consequently, the name as it appears in Reginald's char ter, is itself an example of that liability to change, by which the same word was subsequently converted to Truro. But the alteration in that case was so slight, that the composition of the word was scarcely obscured ; and so natural, that its corruption could not have been pre vented. For it was hardly possible in common speech to avoid the elision, which turns Trerivero into Trivero ; as"], [806, "316 CORNISH NAMES. this again has been contracted to Truro. The word Truro, then, signifies the Toivn-on-the-rivers, or as we should now say, Riverton. And this interpretation is illustrated and confirmed by the local peculiarities : for the town is inter sected by two rivers, which originally yvere its boundaries \u2014 the Cenion on the south, and the Allan on the east. With respect to Marazion or Marketjew, I need not ex amine what has been said about Sion, Jerusalem, and the Jews ; for it is wholly unfounded and absurd. Marghas, or in its softer form Maras, signifies a market, and Tan, of or belonging to an island. Hence Marasian means the Island-market. This name is derived from St. Michael's Mount, which is in fact an island ; and to its monastery the market belonged. Marghasjew, as it is called in Elizabeth's charter, or as we now speak, Marketjew, sig nifies Thursday-market : the charter, by yvhich the privi lege of a market was granted to the monks by Robert, earl of Cornwall, having appointed it to be kept on the fifth day of the week. In Domesday the town is called Tremarastol, which signifies the Market-town-of-the-mo nastery. These three names, therefore, mutually explain one another ; and their signification is confirmed by the historical facts. Penzance is said to signify \" the Saint's head, or rather the Head of the bay.\" Polwh. Hist, of Cornwall, vol. ii. p. 39. I believe that Mr. Polwhele quotes this from Tonkin. But did Tonkin himself expect that his readers would be satisfied with an etymology so indeterminate and contradictory ? Yet this is the usual mode of explain ing Cornish words. Camden says, that Penzance, or as he more correctly spells it, Pensans, means the Head of the sands. But Whitaker declares this to be unworthy of Camden ; and he therefore gives us an improved inter pretation of his own. For this purpose he reads Tonkin backwards ; and as that writer renders Pensans the Head of the bay, Whitaker asserts it to be the Bay of the Head ! And this is unworthy of Whitaker. He says, the phrase is equivalent to Mount's bay. But it was never imagined before, that the Cornish word Pen could signify such an object as St. Michael's Mount; and still less can it be supposed that a town yvould be denominated a Bay. Yet the real signification of Pensans -lay at his feet ; for nothing can be more obvious and easy. The name is derived both from the little chapel of St. Anthony, which he himself"], [807, "317 CORNISH NAMES. describes, and from the point of land, on which that chapel stood. For there the town took its beginning; and there, of course, it found a name \u2014 that of the place which it occupied. Now a point of land was in Cornish called Pen ; and when it chanced to be distinguished by the erection of a chapel, it would naturally be denominated sacred or holy, which was expressed by the word san, or if it was a terminal syllable, sans. Hence Pensans signifies Holy-head ; and in allusion to this, John the Baptist's head is in the town-arms. But Mr. Whitaker would not have committed this error, if he had been heedful of a principle, observed in the composition of Cornish words, which can never be safely overlooked, in any attempt to investigate their meaning. The ancient names of places in Cornwall mostly consist of two substantive nouns, one of which has the force of an adjective, and qualifies the other : as Penrose, Penpraze, Polwhele. The component parts of such words have always been treated as if they had been associated by caprice, or accident; and the same elements have been represented as adjectives or substantives indifferently, ac cording to the fancy or convenience of the interpreter. But in truth, the ingredients of all these compounds are combined and distinguished by a settled rule. It is generally supposed, that in all instances the word used substantively precedes that which is employed adjectively. In many cases, however, it does not : and as, therefore, the qualifying noun cannot with certainty be discovered by its position, they who suppose it to occupy uniformly the second place, can be right only by chance ; and we are consequently to look for some other mark, by which it may be easily and invariably known. That mark is the accent.

XII. EARLS OF CORNWALL. The following account of the different individuals who have held the office of Prince or Earl of Cornwall from the earliest times, till the period of its becoming merely nominal, excepting as to emolument and patronage, with the new appellation of Duke, under the fantastic settle ment of King Edward the Third, is derived from Dug dale's Baronage. EARLS OF CORNWALL ANTE CONQU : Anno 499. Of this county was Gorlois Earl, in the time of Uther Pendragon, King of the Britons, of whom this is reported.3 That Uther determining to solemnize the Feast of Easter at London, yvith great honor, ap pointed all his nobles to be thereat, amongst which, this Gorlois then was, together with Igerna his wife, whose beauty did surpass all other British women, so that the king fell in love with her, and courted her yvith all deli cates; which being discerned by the Earl, he retired speedily into his country without leave ; the king, there fore, being highly incensed against him for so doing, hasted after him into Cornwall, and fired divers of his towns, and at length besieged him at Dimilioch, provoked him to come out to battle, which he did so inconsiderately, Math. Westm."], [837, "347 EARLS OF CORNWALL. he being one of the first mortally wounded, his followers disperst themselves. After whose death the king took Io-ema to wife, and begot on her a son, called Arthur, who became afterwards not a little famous. Anno 5)7. The next Earl was Cador,b who when King Arthur had besieged Colgrine, the Saxon General in the City of York, understanding that Baldulph the brother of Colgrine, expecting the coming of more Saxons upon the sea coast, designed to fall upon King Arthur in the night time, Arthur having notice thereof by his scouts, sent this valiant Cador with six hundred horse, and three thousand foot, who, meeting the enemy unex pectedly, slew many of them, and routed the rest. Anno 520. About three years after,*5 upon another invasion of the Saxons, and a great battle fought with them near Bathe in Somersetshire, wherein Colgrine and Baldulph (before mentioned) lost their lives ; and Chel dric the other principal leader of them, with the remaining part of their forces, were put to flight, this Earl Cador, by King Arthur's command, pursued them into the Isle of Thanet, slew Cheldric, and forced the rest to yield themselves to his mercy. Anno 542. This noble Cador left issue Constantine,*5 whom King Arthur at his death appointed to be his suc cessor in his kingdom of Britain. The next Earl was Godric,c of whom I have seen no other mention than that Egelwold, sometime King of England, leaving no other issue that survived him, but one daughter, named Goldusburgh, (six years of age at his death) committed her to the tuition of this Godric, who afterwards gave her in marriage to Haveloc, son to Birkelan King of Denmark. In the time of King \u00c6thelred, Ailmer, or \u00c6thelmare, (for so he was also called) was Earl of this county, who being a person of singular piety, founded d first of all the Abbey of Cerne in Dorsetshire, in the days of King Ed gar, and had so great a veneration to the memory of Eadwan, brother of S. Edmund the Martyr, who ledd an hermit's life in Dorsetshire, e before mentioned, near to a certain spring called the Silver Well, that with the help of Dunstan (Archbishop of Canterbury) he translated his \" Mat.

After this, scil. in An. 1005 (in the time of King Ethel red,) he founded s the Abbey of Eynesham in Oxfordshire, and likewise h the Priory of Bruton in Somersetshire, (all Monks of the Benedictine Order) which he amply en dowed, as by the authorities which I have here cited will appear; though in that of Bruton, canons of S. Augustine were afterwards placed. This Ailmer was ' also Earl of Devonshire, under which title, in the year 1013, when' Suane, King of Denmark, overrun the greatest part of the land with his army, and forced King Ethelred to betake himself unto the city of Winchester for refuge, he with all the great men of the West, fearing the tyranny of the Danes, submitted ' them selves to Suane, and gave hostages > for their peaceable obedience unto him. And about three years after this, when King Edmond Ironside fought so stoutly against King Canute, (son to the same Suane) he joining k with that traitorous Eadric Streone, Earl of Mercia, and Earl Algar, adhered k to Canute. Of his issue there nothing more appeareth, than that he left a son - called \u00c6thelward, who in the year 1018 was killed1 by King Canute, together with that great traitor Eadric Streone, Earl of Mercia. ROBERT, EARL OF CORNWALL. To this Earldom was Robert, Earl m of Moreton in Normandy,\"1 brother to King William by the mother, shortly*51 after the Conquest advanced, and had other great honours given m him in this realm. In the time of King William Rufus, taking n part with his brother Odo, Earl of Kent, in that insurrection on the behalf of Robert Curthose, he held \u00b0 the castle of Pevensey on that account ; but so soon as the King laid siege thereto, rendered \u00b0 it up to him, and made his peace. This Earl having hadP the standard of Saint Michael ' Ibid. p. 258 and 259. \u00bb Monast. Anglic, vol. 2, p. 206 a. 1 Math. Westm. in anno 1013. k Matth. Westm. in anno 1016. 1 R.

Michael, at the Mount in Cornwall, unto the Monks of S. Michael de Periculo Maris in Normandy, and to their successors in pure alms. To the Abbey of Grestein in Normandy,1\" founded by Herlwine de Contevill, his father, he was a great bene factor, for he gave s thereunto the lordships of Gratings and Broteham in Suffolk, and the tithe of Cambis, as also his lands at Saisinton in Cambridgeshire ; which place of Gratings (now Cretings) was a cell to that foreign monas tery. He likewise s gave thereto the manor of Wil minton in Sussex, where also there was a cell for monks of that religious house ; and in Ferlis s five hides of lands. In Pevensel he gave s them the house of one Engeler ; and in his Forest of Pevensel, granted to them pannage and herbage, with timber for repair of their churches and houses, as also fuel for fire. He gave moreover to that Abbey of Grestein half the fishing of Langeney, and the whole tithe of that fishing, as also the churches of Eldene, Wesdene, and Ferles, and one hide of land at Heetone. But whereas he found that the greatest part of the possessions which belonged to the Priory of St. Petroc at Bodmin in Cornwall, founded by King \u00c6thelstan, had been1 taken from the same, and enjoyed by canons secular, he therefore seised ' upon the remainder, and converted them to his own use. When he departed this world, I do not find ; but if he lived after William Rufus so fatally lost his life by the glance of an arrow in New Forest from the bow of Walter Tirell; then was it unto him that this strange apparition happened, which I shall here speak of, otherwise it must be to his son and successor Earl William, \u2014 the story u whereof is as followeth.

This Earl Robert took to wife x Maud, daughter to Roger de Montgomery (Earl of Shrewsbury) which Maud was also a great benefactress to the Monks of Grestine in Normandy, by the gift v of Conoc, consisting of ten hides, and two hides in Bodingham, with the church of that place, as also one house in London, with all customs thereto be longing. Moreover, she gave \u00a5 unto them two and thirty hides of land which she had of Roger de Montgomery her father, viz. at Harinton eight, at Mersen eleven, at Hiteford six, at Langeberge two, at Tavistone three and an half, and at Clavendon three yards land. By this Maud he had issue2 William, who succeeded him in these earldoms of Moreton and Cornwall, and three daughters, whose christian names are not expressed ; whereof the first was wife2 to Andrew de \"Vitrei; the Se cond to 2 Guy de la Val ; the third to the Earl of Thou louse, brother to Raymond Count of St. Giles, who behaved himself so valiantly in the Jerusalem expedition.

Upon the death of this Reginald, the king retained s the Earldom of Cornwall in his own hands, and likewise all his lands in England and Wales, for the use of John his own son (afterwards king), excepting s a small proportion to his daughters before mentioned. I come now to Henry (the older of his illegitimate sons) in regard he was a person of note in his time. This Henry, by the name l of Henry Fitz-Count, had in 4 Joh. an assignation * of \u00a320 (current money of Anjou) for his support in that king's service at Roan ; and about that time gave u twelve hundred marks for the lands of William de Traci, which lands Hugh de Curtenai and Henry de Traci afterwards enjoyed. In 17 Joh. this Henry had from the king a grant x of the whole county of Cornwall, with the demesnes, and all other its appurtenances, to farm, until the Realm should be in peace, and the king clearly satisfied whether he ought to hold it by right of inheritance, or as part of the demesne of the crown ; and being then made constable v of the castle at Lanceston, rendered v up the government of the castle of Porcestre, which he had formerly held. Moreover, by the assent z of that king, he held z the town and castle of Totneis, as also z the manors of Corneworth and Lodeswell, which Reginald de Braose formerly had by the grant of King Henry the Second. And 1 Hen. III. obtained another grant a of the county of Cornwall, with all its appurtenances, to hold in as full and ample manner as Reginald Earl of Cornwall held it, and not to be dis- seised thereof, but by judgment of the King's Court. In 4 Hen. III. it appears b that he stood indebted to the king in five hundred ninety-seven pounds and one mark, which was due by him to King John for the honour of Braeles (alias Broeneis), and that the same year dis- obeying0 the king's commands, as also stubbornly depart- ing0 the court without leave, the king discharged all his subjects,0 and in particular those of Cornwall, from hav ing anything to do with him. Howbeit, soon after, through the mediation c of the Bishops of Norwich, Winchester, and Exeter, as also c of Hubert de Burgh (then Justice of 5 Joh. Tinemuth, MS. in Bibl. Bodl. lib. 19, cap. 104.

But that as it seems was never done : for certain it is that the king did not arrive to his full age tdl long after the death of this Henry, it being evident e that he died about two years after, viz. in 6 Hen. III. whereupon command was given to the Sheriff of Cornwall, that he should permit his executors to enjoy all his goods, and likewise the rents of all his lands whereof he was pos sessed when he went to Hierusalem for the full term, for all those who were signed with the cross. It is by some thought that this Henry succeeded his father in the Earldom of Cornwall, in regard that King Henry the Third in the first year of his reign granted to him the county of Cornwall, with all its appurtenances, as is above expressed. But considering that the title of earl was neyrer attributed to him after that time, I cannot conceive anything more passed by that grant, than the barony or revenue of that county. For it is observable, that in patent f to Richard Duke of Gloucester, by King Edward the Fourth, whereby he grants him Castrum, Comitatum, Honorem, et Dominium Richmundi\u00e6, there passed no more than the mere Seignorie, otherwise he would not have omitted the title of Earl thereof amongst his styles. The like may be noted of Raphe Earl of West merland, who had Castrum, Comitatum, Dominium, et Honorem Richmundi\u00e6 granted s to him by King Henry the Fourth, yet never enjoyed the title of Earl of Richmond.

III. had the like grant n of the custody of the county of Cornwall (id est the sherevalty) during the king's pleasure, Henry de Berkering being his substitute. In this 9th year of Henry III. he was girt \u00b0 with the sword of knighthood, upon Candlemas Day, with ten other noble persons who were designed for his service ; and soon after accompanied p William Longespe, Earl of Salisbury, (his uncle,) into Gascoigne, having letters of P recommendation from the King to the Archbishop and Citizens of Burdeaux, who gladly welcoming him thither, assisted 9 him with their best advice for recovery of those lost territories ; whereupon he raised 9 forces in all those parts, having had from the king (before he set out of England) a grant of the county of Cornwall, with all Poictou, for which respect he was generally called 9 Earl of Poictou ; and marching into the country, in a short time subjugated 9 all those places by force which declined to do homage to him, receiving a supply r of Welsh from hence, with a large r sum of money.

Whereat the king took such offence that he required him forthwith to do it, or depart the realm ; unto which he answered, that he would not deliver up the land, nor, without the sentence of his peers, go out of the kingdom ; and in great discontent departing went u to his own house ; which breach betwixt the king and him caused Hubert de Burgh (then justice of England, and in chief power at court) to advise the king to surprise him in his bed the next night following, lest he should raise a disturbance in the realm ; but being privily advertised of that design, he fled immediately away, making no stop till he got * to Reading ; and thence hasting to Marlbo rough, there found his trusty friend William Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, unto whom having made relation of what had passed, they took their course to the Earl of Chester ; and being thus got together, through the power and interest of their friends raised a potent army, mak ing their rendezvous at Stanford, whence they sent a minatory message to the king, but imputing- all the fault to Hubert de Burgh, requiring a confirmation of that charter of the forest which had been cancelled at Oxford. The king, therefore, discerning this cloud, appointed a meeting at Northampton upon the third of the nones of August next following, assuring them that he would there do full right unto all ; where meeting accordingly, for their better satisfaction (amongst other his condescensions) he gave this Earl Richard his mother's dowry, with all the lands in England which did appertain to the Earl of Bri tanny, as also those which belonged to the Earl of Bolein, then deceased y ; whereupon, he had livery z of the whole Annal.

And the next year following, viz. 26 Hen. III. returned ; the king, therefore, having intelligence thereof, with the queen, metu him at Dovor.

But finding that the king did not incline to follow the counsel of those who sought the general honour and good of himself and the realm, after some sharp dispute -with him thereon, he associated himself with the Earls Marshal, Hereford, and some others, and took}' shipping for France.

And, furthermore, seeing he could not prevail with them that way, he corrupted some with gifts to effect his desires, viz. to lay hands on him as a rebel, and cast him in prison ; also, that having advertisement thereof (then lodging in the monastery of S. Cross at Bourdeaux) he got privily on shipboard to come for England, but without provisions or any necessaries for the journey; and lastly, (to add to his affliction,) that he was so tossed yvith a fearful tempest, as that being in no little peril of shipwreck, he made a vow to found an abbey for monks of the Cistercian order, in case he should safe arrive in Eng land. The next thing memorable of him is, that having taken another journey to the Holy Land (with William Longespe, Earl of Salisbury), he returned81 thence, in anno 1422, (26 Hen. III.) and accompanied a the king into Gas coigne, in aid of Hugh le Brun, Earl of March (who had married the king's mother), and was a with him in that battle near Xant against the King of France ; after which, the next ensuing year, he married b Senchia, daughter of Reymund Earl of Provence, sister to the Queen, the wed ding being kept at Westminster with great pomp, whom he endowed c at the church door with the third part of all his lands, whereof he then stood possessed, or should afterwards acquire, the castle and manor of Berkhamp stead being part ; and shortly' after, keeping his Christ mas d at Walingford, entertained the d king and most of the nobility there with extraordinary feasting.

In anno 1250, (34 Henry III.) passing i through France with a pompous retinue, viz. \u2022 forty knights, all in rich liveries, five waggons, and fifty sumpter horses, (his lady and his son Henry being also with him,) the pope being then at Lyons, sent k all his cardinals, except one, besides a number of clerks, to meet him, and conduct him thither, and there receiving him with great respect, feasted k him at his own table. Being returned k from thence in anno 1251, (35 Hen. III.) on the eve of St. Leonard, he caused the Church of Hales to be dedicated k with great solem nity; which, with extraordinary costs, he had so founded, as is before observed. And in 36 Hen. III. obtained a grant1 of the Manor of Ocham in Rutland (sometime be longing to Isabel de Mortimer), in part of payment of five hundred pounds due to him from the king, upon the marriage of Senchia his wife, to hold to himself and the heirs of his body by her. Moreover, the next ensuing year, Albert, a clerk, com ing m over into England from the Pope, made offer to him of the kingdom of Apulia, of which he refused*11 to accept, unless he might have some cautionary places of strength, as also hostages, for securing his possession. And in 38 Hen. III. the king then going into Gascoigne he was joined11 with the queen in the government here during his absence, in which year he exacted vast sums of money from the Jews for the king's use. It is observed,0 that in anno 1255, (39 Hen. III.) upon a full meeting of the nobles in Parliament at Westminster, the king specially applied himself to this earl by a formal speech for a large supply of money, viz. forty thousand pounds, the pope having also written letters to him for that purpose, signifying that he should therein give a good example to others ; but herein he answered neither of their expectations.

In order whereunto, taking leave 9 of his friends on the third day in Easter week, he committed 9 himself to the prayers of the religious, and began his journey towards Yarmouth, there to fcJke shipping, leaving the charge r of his castles and lands in England to the Bishop of London, and arriving shortly at Aquisgrave, was there crowned s king upon Ascension day. Having thus received that great honour, he returned ' thence the next year after, and landed * at Dovor upon the day of S. Julian, where the king met him yvith much joy. After this, during his stay here, he made great preparation for his journey back to receive the crown of the Empire, which the pope underhand endeavoured u to obtain for him. But that which I have next observed to be most memo rable of him is, that upon that grand rebellion of those haughty spirited barons, then headed by Montfort Earl of Leicester and Clare Earl of Gloucester, he then adhered stoutly x to the king ; and in 48 Henry III. marched with him to Northampton, where the chief strength of all their forces at that time were met together, and that he assisted * him in the siege and taking of that town, as also that, pursuing their dissipated forces into Sussex, (where the Londoners, with all their power recruited them,) he commanded v the body of the king's army in that fatal battle of Lewes, where he shared with him in the unhappy p M.

Northampton, and Warden of the Forest. Having thus done with the chief of his secular actings and employments, I now come to his works of piety. Besides his foundation of the Abbey of Hales (whereof I have already made mentiAn) he likewise founded b that of Rewley (of the same order*n the suburbs of Oxford ; and moreover granted c to the monks ,6s Bee, in Normandy, that all their tenants within the precincts of the honour of Walingford should be exempted from suit of court to that honour, provided that his bailiff of Walingford should every year keep a court leet for the manor of Okebourne within the bounds^ of the prioryathere (which yvas a cell to Hee. to see' that the king'M^'ace should lie duly kept, and that the benefit arising by that leet should redound to those monks of Okebourne, they entertaining the bailiff of Walingford with three or four horse of his retinue at their charge for that day. Furthermore, he gaved to the canons of the Holy Trinity at Knaresburgh, for the health of his soul and the souls of his ancestors, the chapel of S. Robert at Knares burgh, with the advowson of the church at Hamstwait, confirming all those grants which King John had given thereto, with divers other lands of great extent. And to the monks of St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, gave e ten shillings rent due to him for St. James Fair, kept yearly near to the Mount. Having thus acted a long part on the theatre of this world with great honour, after a tedious sickness f at his manor of Berkhampstead, in com.

But not withstanding this, it seems that he inclined to them again for the next y^ear following, (viz. 48 Hen.

Howbeit, shortly after, the king holding a Par liament at London, amongst those who fell off from that rebellious pack he was u one, and thenceforth stuck stoutly to the king, marching v with him to Northampton, where the chief of their strength being then got together, after a sharp dispute were vanquished.v Moreover, in the battle of Lewes, he was x one of the principal commanders in the body of the king's army, at that time led by Richard King of Almaine his father ; and after that fatal overthrow there (through the assistance of the Londoners, who poured out all the strength they could make to their aid), seeing the king and divers of the nobles made prisoners,1 he joined with Prince Edward in mediating a fair reconciliation betwixt both parties ; and, in order thereto, the next day following put himself into the hands of Montfort, and the rest.

XIV. EPITAPH OF RICHARD CAREW, OF ANTONY, ESQ. The circumstances under which it has happened that no correct copy has hitherto been printed of the epitaph of Carew, in the church of Antony, are remarkable. The learned Cam den was solicited to supply it originally, as is shown by his Epistol\u00e6, p. 106 ; but Richard Carew, Esq. the son of the deceased, appears to have preferred a more circumstantial composition, at the same time that he retained several of Cam den's expressions. Hugh C , Esq. who wrote the Life of the Historian prefixed to the Survey of Cornwall, quoted the epitaph, not from the monument, but from Camden's Epistol\u00e6 ; and he was followed by Mr. Polwhele and Mr. Lysons, under tbe impression that it was the actual inscription on the tomb, nor was the deficiency supplied in the handsome reprint of Carew's Survey by Lord de Dunstanville. It is believed that Mr. C. S. Gilbert was the first to copy it, but very inaccurately, in his Historical Survey of Cornwall, ii. 388 ; and the first perftct copy is the present. \" FUI, NON SUM.
