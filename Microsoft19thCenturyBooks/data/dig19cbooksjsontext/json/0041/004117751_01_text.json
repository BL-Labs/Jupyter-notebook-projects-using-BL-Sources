This Third Appendix to the fifth edition of the System of Mineralogy is designed to make the work complete up to January, 1882. Its publication has been unavoidably delayed long after the date originally set for its completion. The fact that seven years have elapsed since the issue of the Second Appendix (March, 1875), will be a sufficient ex planation of the perhaps inconvenient length to which it extends. This Appendix contains : (1), full descriptions of all species announced asnew since the publication of Appendix II. ; and (2), references to all important mineralogical articles which have been published during the same period, with citations from them of many new analyses and new facts as to physical characters and localities. Under each species the entries are, for the most part, arranged under two heads : that of Crystallization (Cryst.), for the articles which treat of the crystalline form ; and that of Analyses (Anal.), for those containing chemical analyses, with or without other matter. The number of \" new species \" is very large, aggregating fully three hundred (300). Unfortunately the original descriptions of a large part of them are very incomplete, and in too many cases the names are contributions only to the nomenclature of the Science. If two very simple rules could be conscientiously followed by those investigating supposed new species, the Science of Mineralogy would be vastly benefited. These are : first, that the material analyzed should in every case be proved by a careful microscopic and chemical examination to be homogeneous ; and, second, that the thorough investigation which is to establish the position of a \" new species \" should precede, not follow, the giving of a new name. A mineral which can be only partially described does not deserve a name. In the classified list of new names on p. xi., those which seem to have a fair claim to recognition (including the names of some well-characterized varieties) are placed first. Following these in each division, are given hi' a paragraph the names, (1), of ordinary varieties having no especially distinctive character ; (2), of imperfectly described or doubt ful species, for which further study is much to be desired ; and (3), of those so-called species which are obviously bad. The names of all species, new and old, are arranged in the body of the work in alphabetical order ; the former are printed in black-faced type. References are given both to the System and also to Appendixes I. and II. ; Appendix III. js, consequently, an index for the earlier Appendixes. The Bibliography includes a list of mineralogical works published since January, 1875. To this is added a list of new journals devoted wholly, or in part, to mineralogical sub jects, and also a list of memoirs upon a single subject of more than ordinary importance. For the explanation of Abbreviations, see the System, pp. xxxv.-xlv., and also this Introduction, p. viii. The thanks of the writer are due to Professor George J. Brush for his kindness in reading a set of the proofs as the work was going through the press. New Haven, April 1st, 1882, in"], [10, ""], [11, "V BIBLIOGRAPHY.

V.\u2014 MEMOIRS ON THE \"OPTICAL ANOMALIES\" OF tSOME CRYSTALLIZED MINERALS. The question as to the true explanation of the \" optical anomalies \" presented by many crystallized minerals has been widely discussed in the past few years. That the crystals of many species exhibit in polarized light optical phenomena, not in harmony with their apparent geometrical form, has long been recognized ; and the explanations which have been offered in earlier years are well understood : that is, the theory of lamellar polarization of Biot, of internal tension of Rcusch, of disturbed molecular structure of 3Iarbach, and so on. The recent discussion of this subject has taken a wide range, and many' new facts have been recorded. Attention has been especially directed to it by the classical memoir of 3Iallard, the importance of which cannot be overestimated, even if his conclu sions are not always accepted (for title see below). According to Mallard's view, as far as"], [15, "bibliography. IX it can be explained in a word, these optical anomalies are explained on the assumption that the crystal exhibiting them is in fact made up of separate individuals regularly grouped, which are of a lower grade of symmetry than that which the complete form simulates. Thus, an apparent isometric cube may be made up of 6 square pyramids, each optically uniaxial, placed with their vertices at the centre of the solid, and their bases forming its sides. Similarly an apparent isometric octahedron may be made up of eight anisotropic triangular pyramids grouped in an analogous manner; and so on. Mallard thus includes under pseudo-isometric species: alum, analcite, boracite, fluorite, garnet, and senarmontite; among the pseudo-tetragonal species: apophylite, brookite, mellite, octahedrite, rutile, vesuvianite, zircon; among pseudo-hexagonal species: apatite, beryl, corundum, penninite, ripidolite, touYraa\\me;pseudo-orthorhombic species: harmotome, topaz; pseudo-monoclinic, orthoclase (microcline). Many additional facts to which the hypothesis of Mallard is appli cable have been published by Bertrand (see below, and under the various species in the body of this work), who has also devised an arrangement of the microscope by means of which, with a high magnifying power, optical investigations may be made in many cases where it was before impossible. Grattarola includes calcite, quartz, nephelite, barite, etc. in the list of species which have an apparent symmetry higher than that which really belongs to them; his conclusions, however, are not based upon observations. In many other cases observers have, on ihe basis of variation in angles, or of optical char acters, reached the conclusion that the species in question really belongs to a system of lower symmetry than that to which it has been ordinarily referred. These cases are recorded in Appendixes II. and III. These last named observations, however, do not in most cases admit of being explained on the hypothesis of Mallard. In many of them the conclusions reached are beyond doubt correct, in others the question must be regarded as still undecided. Tschermak proposes the term mimetic for those forms (\" mimetische Formen \"), which imitate a higher grade of symmetry by the grouping (twinning) of individuals of a lower grade of symmetry, as for example, aragonite. Mallard's hypothesis has been opposed by various investigators on the ground that it does not explain many observed facts and is decidedly at variance with others. The observa tions of Klocke, Jannettaz, Klein, Ben Saude, are especially to be mentioned. A few of the facts bearing upon the question are given under boracite (p. 17) and analcite (p. 5). Klocke shows that the same crystal of alum may contain truly isotropic (normal) and aniso tropic (abnormal) portions ; also that the so-called distortion of the crystals and their posi tion during their formation influences the optical phenomena observed. He shows, also, that preparations of gelatine, hardened under tension, show all the optical phenomena of the crystals under discussion. This subject cannot be elaborated here ; it is enough to say that the observations of the mineralogists mentioned, as also of others, seem to confirm the view of Reusch, that at least in many cases (e. g. analcite, garnet, vesuvianite, etc.) the \"optical anomalies \" are to be explained as due to the state of molecular tension existing within the crystal. The investigation of this subject cannot, however, be regarded as entirely completed. A good general review of this subject is given by Zirkel in the llth edition of Naumann's Mineralogy, pp. 152 et seq., also p. 722, 1881.

The question as to the crystalline system of analcite has been recently discussed, as follows: Schrauf (Anzeig. Ak. Wien, 1870), referred crystals from Friedeck, Bohemia, to the orthorhombic system, describing them as complex twins, analogous to those of leucite described by vom Rath. 3Iallard (Ann. Min., VIL, x., Ill, 1870) describes the optical anomalies of the species, and explains them by assuming that a crystal is formed by the interpenetration of three pseudo-tetragonal individuals, each one of which is formed of two orthorhombic crystals, with nearly equal axes ; these 24 orthorhombic crystals, com- posing a single pseudo-isometric crystal, correspond to the 24 planes of a tetrahexahedron. Lasaulx (J. Min., 1878, 510) describes the results of an optical examination of crystals of picranalcite from Monte Catini, Tuscany, and concludes (but see below) that they can be only explained by the assumption that a crystal is made up of 12 triclinic individuals interpenetrating each other, analogous to the compound crystals of phillipsite (q. v.). Schulten (Bull. Soc. Min., iii, 150, 1880) has obtained trapezchcdral crystals by artificial means, and on optical grounds claims for them a complex structure, analogous to that as.5umed by Mallard (see above); with him, however, the crystals are l-hoinbohedral. Crystals obtained later by a different method were isotropic (ib., v., 7, 1882.) On the other hand, later investigations by v. Lasaulx, (Z. Kryst., v., 330, 1881) on crystals from the Cyclopean Is., have led him to the conclusion that the optical phenomena are to be explained (as formerly accepted) by reference to the varying degrees of tension existing in the interior of the crystal. Arzruni and Koch (Z. Kryst., v., 483, 1881) have also, after a review of the whole subject, and an extended optical examination of specimens, espe- cially from Kerguelen Is. and the Cyclopean Islands, concluded that analcite is to be referred to the isometric system. Finally, the whole subject has been exhaustively reviewed arid further investigated by Ben Saude (Inaug. Diss., Stuttgart, 1881, and J. Min., 1882, i., 41). He describes the results of an optical examination of sections of many crystals cut parallel to the cubic, octahedral, dodeeahedral, and trapezohedral (2-2) planes, and shows that they do not correspond with J/allard's hypothesis, but can be explained on the sup position of internal tension. He found, further, that gelatine cast into moulds corre sponding to the crystalline forms acquired on solidifying similar optical characters. Anatase. \u2014 See Octahedrite, p. 85.

Neglecting the silica, the formula calculated by Blomstrand is R2Cb20, + 2J aq., which makes it nearly identical with samarskite, and also to the less certain nohlite (App. IL, p. 41), except in the water; Brogger, however, shows that the water is not essential, but is due to a partial alteration which is accompanied by a lowering of the hardness (to 4'5) and specific gravity (to 428), and a loss of lustre. A crystal with G. = 5-7 showed only a trace of water. The mineral is consequently hardly to be separated from samarskite in composition, but it is different in form (see E. S. Dana, Am. J. Sc, III., xi., 201, 1876). Brogger shows further, that annerodite (euxenite and polycrase) bears the same relation to columbite that samarskite does to tantalite ; the two last being very near in form, as are annerodite and columbite.

Wien, xlix., 341, 1864; 2, 3. Boricky, ib., lvi., 11, 1867; 4. Frenzel, from Scheibenberg, Saxony, J. Min., 1873, 23. P.05 Fe\u201e03 H\u201e0 1.

Streng shows that in composition the St. Benigna mineral is nearly identical with eleonorite, but regards the differences in physical characters too great to allow of their being united. The mineral of Frenzel seems to have a different crystalline form. Bertrand (Bull Soc. Min., iv., 88, 1881), has subjected both the beraunite and eleonorite to a new examination, and concludes that in angles, dichroism and optical qualities they are tha same. There would seem consequently to'be little doubt of their identity. Bergamaskite. \u2014 See Amphibole, p. 5. Bernardinite. \u2014 Described as a new fossil resin from San Bernardino, Cal., by J. 31.

Min., VII., x., 148, 1870) describes the optical anomalies observed in crystals of beryl, and concludes that it is pseudo-hexagonal, the individuals of which a crystal is made up being orthorhombic ; the relations are regarded as similar to those in apatite. See also Des Cloizeaux, Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 94, 1881. Atterberg (Geol. For. Forh., h., 405, 1874) uses the name pseudo- emerald (pseudo smaragd) to designate a mineral resulting from the alteration of beryl. The name was introduced by Berzelius for pseudomorphous crystals, consisting, as he regarded it, of ordinary beryl and mica. Atterberg retains the name for the hard portion of similar pseudomorph's, which, however, he finds to be not true beryl. Its characters are : hard ness 5-5 ; G. = 2-70 ; lustre waxy; color dark grayish green ; fracture splintery. Inti mately mixed with mica scales.

Grattarola (Riv. Scientif.-industr., No. 19, 1880, Florence) has given the name rosterite to a mineral which he regards as a distinct variety of beryl. It occurs in short prismatic to tabular doubly-terminated crystals. Basal plane rounded, and apparently formed of many planes of varying position, belonging to the second series. In polarized light a basal sec tion is divided into six sectors, corresponding to the prismatic edges, for the three alternate of which the extinction is the same.

[The reasons for regarding this as a distinct variety of beryl are : its crystalline habit, its optical character, and the variation in chemical composition. To the first, however, no weight can be given, and as little to thc second, since analogous optical anomalies have been previously observed in ordinary beryl ; as to the composition, further careful analy ses are needed to establish that point. ] Locality, Island of Elba. Berzelhte, Min., p. 544.\u2014 W. Lindgren (Geol. For Forh.; v., 552, 1881) states that the hitherto accepted description of berzeliite is incorrect, in consequence of its having been confounded with another mineral which occurs at Langban, associated with it.

Min., VIL, x., 93, 1876; and Bull. Soc. Min.. ii., 147; E. Geinitz, 3. Min., 1876, 484; 1877, 394; Baumhauer, Z. Kryst., iii, 337, 1879; Klein, 3. Min., 1880, ii., 200; 1881, [., 239. Geinitz shows that (contrary to the earlier explanation) unaltered boracite is anisotropic; Mallard makes the species pseudo-isometric, explaining the optical phenomena by the grouping of twelve orthorhombic individuals (as remarked by Klein this hypothesis was proposed by Hartmann in 1826). Baumhauer reaches a conclusion somewhat similar to that of Mallard on the basis of the results of, etching experiments. Klein, however, seems to settle the question conclusively in favor of the true isometric character of the species. He shows, for example, that the interior optical structure does not correspond to the exterior planes', that the distribution of the etching figures does not depend on the interior optical limits; and further, that upon an increase of temperature the former optical limits dis appear or become indistinct, and that the optical fields change their position without affect ing the form of the etching figures. He concludes that all the optical anomalies can be explained by the internal tension produced in the course of the growth of the crystal. Borax. \u2014 Min., p. 597; App. IL, p. 8.

Beil Bd., i , 144, 1880) has done the same for that occurring in the syenite of Ditro, Transylvania. Both show that there is every reason, both as regards the physical characters and the constancy of chemical composition, to consider the mineral as an original species, and not as a decomposition product arising from the action on nephe lite of a carbonated solution. The observations of Koch on the behavior of a thin section, when tueated with HC1, are especially conclusive as showing that the C02 is present, not as calcite mechanically mixed, but as a true element in the composition of the silicate.

Occurs intimately mixed with calcite and hausmannite, at Langban, Wermland, Sweden. Named from xapvivof, nut-brown. Sjogrcn remarks that berzeliite occurs with caryinite, and sometimes enclosing it. He finds the berzeliite isotropic (isometric), and the caryinite anisotrope (monoc-Unic V), and as the two species have analogous composition, he suggests that the former may have been formed from the latter (Geol. Fcir. Forh., ii , 533, 1875). Lindgren (ib., v., 556, 1881), however, describes the way in which the minerals occur together, and concludes, for certain cases, that the caryinite is altered into berzeliite. [The genetic relation between caryinite and berzeliite merits further examination.] According to Des Cloizeaux (Bull. Soc, Min. , iv., 56, 1881), the mineral has two cleavages, at an angle of 130\u00b0. 2E = 41\u00b0 58' to 47\u00b0. Dispersion p > v, also horizontal (hence mono clinic).

On treating the graphite from the interior of the meteoric iron of Sevier, Tenn., with tth^r. Smith obtained small quantities of acicular crystals having a peculiar odor, mixed with some small rounded points. These he regards as identical with crystals obtained from the iron of Alais, France (Mar. 1-3, 1806i, by Roscoe (Proc. Lit. Phil.\" Soc. Manchester, iii., 57, 1863). Smith has obtained the same crystals from the Alais meteorite. In the closed tube he finds that they fuse at 115\u00b0-120\u00b0, and at a higher temperature the sulphur is sublimed, and a black residue left behind. He regards these crystals as proof of the presence of a sulpho-hvdrocarbon, for which he proposes the name celestialite. Roscoe (1. c ) found that 1-94 p. c of the meteorite dissolved in ether, and from the solution he obtained crystals melting at 114\u00b0 C, and in two forms : acicular, which he considered as near to konlite (Min., p. 737), and rhombic, which he identified as free sulphur.

H.\u2014 Beck? has studied minutely the optical characters of chabazite crystals from different localities, and concludes that the long recognized optical anomalies are to be explained by the assumption of a complicated twin ning of triclinic individuals; this twinning, however, is according to the accepted princi ples (analogous to aragonite), and does not require any new hypothesis as that of Mal lard. He finds, for example, that a basal section in polarized light shows a composi tion of six differently orientired individuals, of which the extinction directions of two neighboring portions are symmetrically arranged with reference to the line of union. A section parallel to a rhombohedral plane, under the same conditions, is divided into two parts along the shorter diagonal. Por further details see the original paper (Min. Petr. Mitth., ii., 391, 1879), or the abstracts (Z. Kryst., v., 377, and J. Min., 1880, ii., 135). Streng (see below) also discusses the same problem, but without arriving at so definite a conclusion. Becke finds gmclinite related in structure to chabazite, while hcrschelite (q. v.) differs from both, and to the latter levynite is probably related. Des Cloizeaux ( Bull.

S.Dana, proving the presence of crystals corresponding to each of the so-called \"types ' of the Vesuvian humite ; also giving measurements and many occurring planes. Further, it is shown, that the optical characters of the crystals of the more common \" second type\" prove them to be, in fact, monoclinic : the axes lie in the plane of symmetry, axial plane in clined 25\u00b0 48' to the basal plane, 2HaP = 88\u00b0 48' (n = 1166', Conn. Acad., iii., 67-96, 1875 (abstr. in Am. J. Sc , HI., x., 89). It has also been proved by the same author, that the crystals of the \"third type \"belong to the monoclinic system (Am, J. Sc, III., xi., 139, 1876). The measured angles alone, however, would not imply any variation from the orthorhombic type, although it has long been observed that the hemihedral development of the planes was in accordance with monoclinic symmetry. The corresponding Vesuvian species, humite, has been studied by Des Cloizeaux (Phil. Mag. III., it, 286, 1876, and iii., 357, 1877; or see J. Min, 1876, 641 ; 1877, 500) and by Klein (J. Min., 1876, 633). Des Cloizeaux finds the three types of humite to be optically distinct, and proposes to retain for the \"first type,\" which he shows to be orthorhombic, the name humite ; for the \" second type,\" which he finds to be monoclinic, he retains the name chondrodite, and to the \"third type,\" also monoclinic, he gives the name clino humite (the observations on the second and third types confirm those of E. S. Dana on Brewster crystals). Klein (1 a.) obtained for third type crystals of humite (clinohumite) re sults agreeing with those of Des Cloizeaux. Sjogren describes crystals from the Ladu mine, Wermland, Sweden, which are holohe dral orthorhombic, and near in angle to \" Type I.\" of the Vesuvian mineral, also others from Kafveltorp, Westmanland, which are monoclinic, and similar (see above) to common chondrodite, \u0152fv.

In this group of \"brittle micas \" {Sprod glimmer) the authors include seybertite (clintonite), brandisite, xanthophyllite, also ehloritoid, masonite, ottrelite, sismondine, and sapphirine. All of these species belong to the monoclinic system, and in form and physical character they are closely related to the micas, more especially to margarite (see original memoir and p. 77). ...

On the other hand, Rammelsberg shows that the analysis of Damour (Min., p. 609) after the de duction of the soluble portion reduces to V205 24'80, PbO 6010, ZnO 2'25, FeO 1-48, MnO 5'87, CuO 0-99, H20 213, Cl 0-35 = 98-57, and this corresponds to R3V20B, H,0, with R = (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu) : Pb = 1 : 2.

Rammelsberg deduces the formula R3 V20\u201e + H.O, with Fe : Mn : Pb = 1 : 1 : 4, this gives : V.O0 2515, PbO 62-09, FeO 5-01, MnO 4-95, H20 2-50 = 100. Occurs with descloizite and vanadinite, at several localities in the State of Cordoba, Argentine Republic. Named for Dr. D. Luis Brackebusch, of Buenos Ayres.

This gives the atomic ratio R : [R,] : As = 2 : 1 : 2; the ratio of 0 : P = 4-7 : 1. The formula may be written R, [R2] As2(0, F.), or nearly [R2] As209 + 2RF; which is analo gous, as remarked by Brush (1. c), to amblygonite, to which, however, in form and optical characters it has apparently no relation (Des Cl. ). Durangite is described by H. G. Hanks (Am. J. Sc, ILL, xii., 274, 1870), as occurring at the Barranca tin mine, eighteen miles north-east of Coneto, State of Durango, and about ninety miles north-east of the city of Durango. The mineral is found not with the stream tin, but in a vein four to six inches in thickness; the crystals are sometimes attached to the walls of the vein (here the large, light, orange-colored variety, App. I., p. 4), sometimes with cassiterite in the white pulverulent matter which fills the veins (small, dark-colored variety, see above). The largest crystal found was 19 mm. long, 11 mm. thick, and weighed 3-022 grams. Durfeldtite. Raimondi, Mineraux du Perou, p. 125, 1878.

Min., Beil.-Bd., i., 203, ls81. Schuster (Min. Petr. Mitth., iii., 117, 1880), has carried through a long series of observa tions as to the optical characters of the triclinic feldspars ; and has established the important conclusion that in an optical sense there is the same gradual transition from one extreme (albite', to the other (anorthite), as is observed in the chemical composition. Thus, he finds that the position of the extinction-directions, as observed on the basal and clinodiagonal planes, the position of the axes of elasticity, the dispersion of the axes, and the axial angle, all show this gradual change in the same direction. These conclusions obviously confirm the now almost universally accepted view of Tschermak, that the intermediate triclinic feld spars (plagioclase) are to be regarded as isomorphous mixtures of albite and anorthite. Mallard (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 96, 1881), has gone further and shown that by means of formulas deduced by him (ib., p. 71), on the view that in isomorphous mixtures (as of albite and anorthite) each element usually enters without chaDge of its own characters, it is possi ble to calculate the direction of extinction for the two planes (0 and ir-i): the results of calculation and experiment agree very closely. Experiments by Fouque and Livy (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 63, 1881), on a series of feldspathic microlites intermediate between albite and anorthite, give results at variance with the above conclusions.

His conclusions are supported by Bertrand (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 12, 13, 1881), who describes more fully the supposed method of grouping of the biaxial elements. For example, a dodeeahedral crystal of aplome, according io this view, is made up of 48 biax ial crystals in the form of triangular pyramids meeting at the centre of the dodecahedron; the bases of four of these pyramids together form a dodeeahedral plane. The acute negative bisectrix is sensibly normal to the base of the pyramid, and the plane of the axes sensibly parallel to the longer diameter of the rhombic face; the axial angle is about 90\u00b0. Bertrand adds that such a crystal can be mechanically divided into the 48 individuals cor responding to the optical division [but see also p. viii, analcite, p. 5, boracite, p. 17]. Garnierite, App, II. , p. 23. \u2014 It has been shown that, as previously suggested, the sub stance called garnierite is not a definite mineral, but consists of a hydrous magnesian sili cate more or less impregnated with nickel oxide ; the amounts of magnesia and nickel vary widely. Some writers, however, prefer to regard the Ni as chemically replacing the Mg (in RSi03 + reaq), but this seems very doubtful. \u2014 See Ulrich, Am. J.

Gay-Lussite, Min., p. 706. \u2014 According to Des Cloizeaux, the so-called pseudomorphs of calcium carbonate after gay-lussite, from Sangethausen, have nothing to do with the latter mineral, but are probably pseudomorphs after celestite; Groth regards them as pseudo morphs after anhydrite (Min.-Samml. Strassburg, p. 142, 1878). Clarence King, however, describes large tufa-like deposits of calcium carbonate in Nevada, forming beds 20 60 feet thick, and at a height of 470 feet above the present level of Pyramid Lake. These deposits are regarded as the shore formation of an enormous lake, called Lake Lahontan, believed to hare existed in quaternary times. This calcium carbonate shows occasionally crystalline forms resembling true gay-lussite, and the whole deposit is believed to have existed origin ally as this mineral. This view is supported by the fact that gay-lussite is now found well crystallized in a lake near Ragtown, Nevada, which is also a remnant of Lake Lahontan. For this pseudomorphous shore deposit King proposes the name of thinolite (from Si's, shore), Geology of the 40th Parallel, vol. 1, 508, 1879.

Min., 1874, 679), was called Frenzelite in Append. II. (q. v.). It appears, however, that the same min eral' was described in 1873 by V. Fernandez, and named Guanajuatite (La Republiea : Periodico oficial del Gobierno del Estado de Guanajuato, July 13) ; the latter name has, con sequently, the priority. Fernandez concludes that the mineral contains only Bi\u201eS3, the sulphur beino- due, in his opinion, to pyrite. He obtained: Se 35-18, Bi 61 00, gangue 310, \u2022Fe S loss 012 = 100. He also gives, H. = 35, G. = 6 62; the locality is the Santa Cata rin'a mine, Sierra de Santa Rosa., near Guanajuato. The same mineral is called castillite by Domevko, Min. Chili, 3d ed, p. 310, 1879. Mallet has re-examined the mineral, and obtained (Am. J. Sc, 111., xv., 294, 18<8) : Se S Bi A1.03 Fe203 Si02 H.O 31-64 0 61 59 92 2-53 tr. 3 47 116 = 99 63. After deducting 612 p. c halloysite, and 056 Si02, present as impurities, the result obtained is : Se 34-33, S 0-68, Bi 6511 = 100.

This simi larity was first pointed out by Nordenskiold (Geol. For. Forh., hi., 232, 1876). B. B. homi lite fuses very readily to a black glass ; reacts for iron and boracic acid. Completely decomposed by HC1 with gelatinization. Found on the Stocko near Brevig, Norway, with meliphanite and erdmannite. Named from duiXsao, to occur together. Des Cloizeaux remarks that some crystals of homilite are throughout doubly refracting, others are composed of a green doubly refracting kernel surrounded by a yellowish crust of singly refracting material, while still others are entirely singly refracting. In this respect it is closely similar to gadolinite; whether this variation is certainly due to alteration does not appear. An analysis of some of the isotropic, brownish-colored fragments gave Damour (G. = 303): SiO. 28-01, B-03 554, ZrO. 3 47, A1.03 3-31, CeO 19-28, DiO,LaO8'09, FeO 512, MnO 1-35, CaO 11 '00, K20 198, Sn02 015, H20 1210, TiOjtr. = 100. Damour remarks the similarity in appearance of the isotropic mineral analyzed by him to true erdmannite, and adds that the mineral supposed to be the latter contains no boron (see also p. 43). Hopeite, Min., p. 514. \u2014 Damour and Des Cloizeaux, Bull. Soc. Min., h., 131, 1879. Friedel and Sarasin, ib., p. 153. Des Cloizeaux has made a crystallographic and optical examination of hopeite, confirming and extending the results of Levy and Haidinger. Damour shows that it is essentially a zinc phosphate, and Friedel and Sarasin have succeeded in forming artificially crystals which have the form and optical properties of hopeite, and which have the composition Zn,P.08 + 4aq, which requires : P203 3L07, ZnO 53-18, H20 15-75. They conclude that this formula expresses also the composition of natural hopeite. According to Schrauf his new species eggonite (q. v.) is closely related in form to hopeite.

Analysis, Damour: Si02 15-95 Mn02 PbO 5919 = 100-24. 24-50 (or Mn.03 22-26) The state of oxidation of the manganese, and hence the true composition of the mineral, is left in doubt ; on the first supposition it is expressed PbMnSiOB, which requires : SiO. 16-21, Mn02 23-52, PbO 60 27 = 100; on the second it is Pb. [Mn2] Si,03, which requires: Si02 16-58, Mn,03 21 83, PbO 6L59 = 100. [The latter formula is the more probable one; see Melanotekite, p. 75.] B.

The first corresponds with the previously accepted formula : Si4[Al.] CaII0Oi5, which, however, expresses the composition of the mineral only after it has lost in dry air, or at 100\u00b0, a part of its water.

The crystalline form is monoclinic, according to him, with si = 89\u00b0 48', and the composition is expressed by the empirical formula H,0PblhC\u201eS3O;,n, which requires S03 817, CO. 8'08, PbO 81 91, H20 184 = 100 (seealso J. pr. Ch., xi., 26, 1874; xn., 347, 1876; xiii, y70, 1876). The extremely complex character of the formula makes it somewhat improbable. Bertrand (C. R., Lxxxvi., 348, 1878) describes leadhillite from Matlock, Derbyshire, with 2E = 72\u00b0 yellow (Sardinia and Scotch crystals have 2E = 21\u00b0); the angle diminishes with rise in temperature, and finally 2E = 66\u00b0 at 250\u00b0 ; above this point the crystals fly to pieces. As bearing upon the question of the independent character of susannite, Bertrand describes crystals from Leadhills, in which he finds gray colored spots with 2E = 21\u00b0, and green colored spots which are uniaxial. The species leadhillite and susannite are prob ably identical. Leidyite. Konig, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad., 1878, 84.

Leucite, Min., p. 334; App. IL, p. 34. \u2014 The question as to the true crystalline system of leucite has been discussed, as follows : Hirschwald, Min.Mitth., 1875, 227 ; Tschermak, Min. Mitth., 1876, 66 (anal, by Berwerth); vom Rath, 3. Min., 1876, 281, 403; Hirschwald, 3. Min., 1876, 519, 733 ; Baumhauer, Z. Kryst, i., 257. 1877 ; Hirschwald, Min. Petr. Mitth., L, 85, 1878 ; Bammhauer, Min. Petr. Mitth, 1, 287, 1878 ; Groth, Z. Kryst, v., 264, 1880; Weisbach, 3. Min., 1880, i., 143; also 3Iallard, Ann. Min., VIL, x., 79, 1876. Hirschwald maintains that the species is, in fact, isometric, with polysynthctic structure. This view is opposed by Bammhauer, vom Rath, and Groth, and the results of a series of experiments on the etching of the crystalline faces seem to prove its tetragonal nature. Mallard regards leucite as pseudo-isometric, referring it to the orthorhombic system, and later, Weisbach, on the basis of a series of measurements by Treptow, has reached a simi lar conclusion. Fouaue and Levy have succeeded in obtaining artificial crystals of leucite (C. R.,lxxxvii., 961, 1878, and Bull. Soc. Min., iii., 118, 1880); and Hautefeuille (C. R., xe, 313, 378, 1880) has formed an iron leucite, containing iron in place of the alumina. In both cases the same twinning is observed, and the same optical characters as in natural crystals.

The occurrence at Silver Islet, Lake Superior, with the metallic silver, of thin plates and grains of a reddish-brown sectile mineral, containing As, Ag, Co, Ni, and supposed to be new, was described by T. Macfarlane in 1870 (Can. Nat, Feb. 1). To the granular ore, or mixture of reddish-colored grains with other minerals, the name macfar lanite was given, later, by Major Sibley (quoted by Macfarlane, Trans. Amer Inst. Min.

His descriptions are as follows : Huntilite. \u2014 In two varieties : (A) Of a dark gray or more commonly black color ; dull, amorphous, porous, and fragmentary; (B) apparently crystalhne; one cleavage direction; bright slate color, and occurs imbedded in calcite.

The author proposes to subtract the Hg as amalgam, and S as pyrite, and then calculat ing the remaining metals as Ag (R = 2R). he obtains the ratio of R : As ( + Sb) = 2-90 : 1 for A, and 2 99 : 1 for B. On the basis of this, thc formula Ag3As is assumed as represent ing the composition. Named after Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. [No value can be attached to the formula deduced (see below), for most of the metals thus taken together are present only as impurities. Compare Arsenargentite, p. 9.] Animikite. \u2014 Occurs as an incrustation on huntilite, also in isolated slabs or plates. Structure fine-granular, crypto-crystalline. G. = 9-45.

Named from \" animikie,\" thunder, whence Thunder Bay. The formula AgaSb is proposed. The complex relations of the above minerals and mineral mixtures has been well investi gated by Macfarlane (1 e). The granular ore was found to be made up of reddish-brown metallic grains, when polished looking like burnished nickel, with an undetermined black mineral, niccolite, galena, calcite, and quartz. The ore, pulverized and freed from all brittle materials by washing, yielded 75 to 84 p. c. silver; the grains finally obtained by repeated trituration and sifting had a dark gray color, and gave 92 p. c. silver; on solution"], [92, "72 appendix m. in dilute nitric acid these grains yielded : Ag 93-54, Ni 1-58, As 2 15, Sb 0-36, insol. 2'37 = 100. The insoluble portion (2-37 p. c.) assayed 17-46 p. c. silver. A quantity of the original metallic grains were acted upon by three successive portions of very dilute nitric acid. The results were : Ag Hg Ni As Sb 1. 3764 065 466 610 017 = 49-52. 2. 33-09 0-10 1-22 .... 0 06 = 3507. 3. 510 tr tr. = 510. There remained 6-20 p. c. insol. (quartz, etc.), and 3-77 p. c. of a black mineral washed from the quartz, containing 24'8 p. e Ag, also Sb, S, Pb, Co, Ni. The author closes by stat ing very justly, that further investigation is needed to determine the character of the various minerals present. Konig (-Proc Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad., 1877, 276) has analyzed a similar mineral mixture from Silver Islet: As 10-56, Sb tr., S 1-81, PbS 3818, Ag 32-68, Ni, Co 896, Fe 0-35, quartz 600, CaC03 1-20=9914. He regards the nickel and arsenic as combined and forming niccolite, which exists mixed with galenite, argentite, and probably a basic silver arsenide. [It would appear from the above, that the true nature of the individual minerals present in the Silver Islet ores is still to be determined, but that there is probably present a silver arsenide (huntilite), and perhaps also a silver antimonide (animikite) allied to dyscrasite.] Maconite. \u2014 App. II. , p. 36.

[The possible relation of the two substances mentioned is remarked by Brezina (1. c). In any case melanophlogite can hardly be regarded as an original mineral, but more probably as an impure form of silica owing its origin to some method of pseudomorphism. v. Lasaulx thinks it cannot be pseudomorphous after fluorite; The observations of Bertrand would not separate it from the so-called pseudo-isometric species.] Melanosiderite. J. P. Cooke, Amer. Acad.

Russl., vii., 107, 177, 222, 225 ; viii , 1 ) finally led him to a conclusion not at variance with this, although he shows that the angles alone do not require the assumption of any obliquity. The results of Bauer (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1877, 684; or Min. Petr. Mitth., 1, 14, 1878) confirm those of Tschermak; he has also determined the indices of refraction of muscovite, by a method based upon relations (established by Neumann) between the optical axes of elasticity and the distances, measured in the axial plane, between the dark rings of the interference figures.

Meroxene, Lepidomelane. Phlogopite, Zinnwaldite. Biotiies: Anomite ; Phlogopites : ( Lepidolite. 3Iuscovites : -j Muscovite. ( Paragonite. 3Iargarites : Margarite. In the first group (i) are included all the micas in which the optic-axial plane is perpen dicular to the plane of symmetry; the second group (ii) includes those in which it is paral lel to the plane of symmetry. For the crystallographic relations of the different species reference must be made to the original paper. The chemical relations reached by Tscher mak are based for the most part on a series of new analyses, very carefully made, to avoid errors fallen into by earlier analysts; these are quoted beyond. Tschermak, on optical grounds (see above), divides biotite into anomite (from clvouoi, contrary to law) and meroxene (Breithaupt's name for the Vesuvian biotite, see Min,, p. 307). Anomite is represented by the mica occurring with diopside in granular calcite, at"], [98, "78 APPENDIX m. Lake Baikal, and that from Greenwood Furnace, N. Y. Its composition, according to Tschermak s view, is expressed by isomorphous mixtures of HjKjALSioO.i (see muscovite, below), and Mg12SiB0,2 (a hypothetical polymere of chrysolite), in the relation of 1 : 1, or 2:1, or intermediate ratios. 3seroxene is represented by the Vesuvian magnesian mica; com position H3K3ALSir,0.4, andMg,2Si\u201e0,2 in the ratio of 1: 1, of 2 : 1, or intermediate ratios. Lepidomelane has the composition H4K2Al6Si6Q24, and Mg12Si60,., with, however, varying amounts of the iron compound H4K.Fe0Sio024. [In this group would belong the haughton ite of Heddle, and siderophyllite of Lewis (see below), varieties characterized by the re placement to large extent, of Mg by Fe] Phlogopiie has the composition: KoALSuO.,, HtSi,0O.4, and Mg,2Sis,024, often in the relation 3:1:4; generally also with F.4Sii0O8 in the place of the second compound. Zinn waldite has the composition : K\u201eAlcSi0O21 (or Li0Al\u201eSicO24), Pe,2Si0O.4, and P24OtSi10 (or the corresponding hydrogen compound), in the relation of 10 : 2 : 3. The muscovites include lepidolite, muscovite, and paragonite. Lepidolite has the compo sition: 3K0AleSicO24 + Si,\u201eOfP24, with the first replaced one-half or more bythe corre sponding lithium compound, and the second by the corresponding hydrogen compound (see also Min. Petr. Mitth., ii., 94, 1879). 3suscovite (including margarodite): K6AlcSic0.4, with the potassium compound replaced in part by the corresponding hydrogen compound, H0AlBSiGO24 ; the commonest formula is H4K2Al\u201eSinO,4. In certain muscovites, for which the name phengite is proposed, the composition is explained as a combination of H.,K2Ale Sir,024, and HtSi10O24, in the ratio of 3: 1 ; these varieties approach to lepidolite. Paragonite (incl. cossaite), composition : H4Na2Al8Sic024. Margarite, composition: H,Ca,AleSi4024 ; related to the clintonite group, see p. 28. [Por the many important details of the crystallographic relations, and, too, the discus sion upon which the above conclusions as to the composition are based, reference must be made to the original articles.] Analyses employed in the above discussion : 1, by John, Lake Baikal ; 2, by P. v.

Ann., ix., 113, 3C2, 1880; also vii., 136, 1879) a recent investigation of the chemical composition of the species of the mica group, includ ing a considerable number of new analyses. He concludes that the micas are in part uni silicates, in part compounds of unisiiicatesand bisilicates; he also assumes the isomorphism r ti vt between these, as well as between similar silicates of metals of the R, R, [R,] series respect ively. He adopts a chemical classification, as follows : 1. Alkali micas : A. Sodium mica (paragonite) formula R.[Al.]Si.08 (unisilicate\\ B. Potassium mica (muscovite), including (1) unisilieates, R...[Al.]Si.O\u201e, with sometimes (M\"-,Fc) Si04; (2) compounds of unisilieates and hisilicates in the ratio of 1 : 3, thus R^IitR.]-, Si120,r, (anal. 1, 2, 3), or in the ratio of 1 : 1, thus : R.Si.O, = R2SiOs -h R.,Si04, or more"], [99, "79 appendix rn specially in part, RMR2[R2]oSiieO,-.3. C. Lithium mica (lepidolite, anal. 4, 5, 6a, 6b) : com pounds of unisilieates and bisilicates in the ratio of 1:3, thus : R10Si40i3 = 3R2Si03 + It4 Si04; or moro specially Rio[R,]sSiioO,;, (Rozena and Paris), and RM[R,2]oSi2oOo5 (Juschak owa). 2. The magnesium mica (biotite pt, anal. 7, 8, 9) is a compound of bisilicates and unisili eates in the ratio of 1: 3, thus : R14R3o[R2]-Si30013r,. 3. The ikon-magnesium mica (biotite pt.) and iron mica (lepidomelane), includes five series, having the following formulas: (1) R.,R4[R,]Sii01{. = R,Si04 + 41\\VSi04 + [R2]2 Si3012 (anal. 10, 11). (2) R,RC[R.] Si,0.\u00bb = R4Si04 + 3R.Si04 + [R.] -Si30,.(anal. 12, 13, 14, 15). (3) R\u201eR2[R2]Si,042 = R4Si04 + 2R2Si04 + [R.].Si30,2 (anal. 16, 17). (4) R.R3 [R,]3Si3O20=R,SiO4 + 3R,Si04 + 2[R2]:Si30,, (anal. 18, 19). (5) R0R3[R2]4Siu03o = 3R4Si04 + 2R.SiO, + 4[R2].Si30i2. To this group are appended several which do not admit of being classified. 4. The lithium-iron mica of Zinnwald (zinnwaldite, anal. 20) is regarded as a compound of bisilicate and unisilicate in the ratio of 2 : 1, thus: R(Si3O10 = 2R2Si03 + R4SiO,; more specially R,oR4[R2]3Si1B06\u00bb, or R12R4[RJ0Sij,07o, according to the ratio of the differ ent elements. 5. The barium mica (\u0153llacherite, anal. 21) is a unisilicate, with the special formula: R8R2 [R.]4Si303e= 2R.,Si04 + R.SiO, + 2[R2].Si30!2. Analyses by Rammelsberg (see also Ber. Ak.

Other analyses by Heddle are given in Min. Mag., iv., 221 et seq., 1881 ; and the same variety has been repeatedly analyzed previously (see above). A mica closely related to the above (a biotite containing only Fe) has been called sidero phyllite by M. G. Lewis (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sc. Philad., 1880, 254). H. = 3'2. G.= 8-1.

Ges., xxvi., 701, 1874) uses this name (of Freiesleben) to designate the original mineral from which the so-called pinite from Stolpen, near Neustadt, has been derived. It is regarded as certain that it is not iolite nor tourmaline, but its true nature is doubtful. Microcline. Des Cloizeaux (Ann. Ch. Phys., V., ix., 433, 1876) uses Breithaupt's name (see Min., p. 355) to designate a new feldspar species established by him: a triclinic potash feldspar. Triclinic and near orthoclase in form, and in habit, twinning, etc., but O A i-4, = 90\u00b0 16'. Extinction direction makes an angle of 15\u00b0 to 16\u00b0 (orthoclase = 0\u00b0), with the edge O / i-4. Polysynthetic twinning, giving rise to striations on O, sometimes observed. A basal section shows in polarized light a characteristic grating-like structure, due to the regular inter growth of twin lamella? ; in these, orthoclase is often enclosed ; irregular lines and bands of albite also often observed. Composition K2 [A1,J SicO,c, or that of orthoclase; an analysis of pure white microcline from Magnet Cove, Arkansas, gave Pisani: SiO, 64-30, A1.03 19-70, Fe.03 0-74, K20 15-60, Na20 0-48, ign. 0-35 = 101-17.

He also calls attention to the essential identity of guadaleazarite of Petersen (App. IL, p. 25, also Rammelsberg, Min.

Found with szaboite, in cavities in the andesite of the Aranyer Berg, Transylvania; also with szaboite and tridy mite in the trachyte of Riveau Grand, Monte Dore. ' Groth (1. c) shows that, the crystallographic determinations of Koch are faulty, and that the crystals may be referred to the axes of brookite by making i-i the basal plane, with which it may be identical, only differing in the large amount of iron. Vom Rath, how ever (Ber. nied. Ges. Bonn, March 3, 1879), thinks this improbable, on the ground that, with this change of position, the analogy with brookite in the vertical striation would no longer exist ; he also urges that, as yet, no one of the three forms of Ti02 has been found in volcanic rocks. Pseudocotunnite. A. Scacchi, Att. Accad. Napoli, vi., 1873 (Contrib. Min., ii., 38). Observed in acicular yellow opaque crystals, destitute of lustre, accompanying cotunnite, at Vesuvius, as a result of the eruption of 1872. Composition probably PbCl2 + KC1. Pseudomalachite, Min., p. 568; App. II., p. 45. \u2014 Schrauf (Z. Kryst.; iv., i., 1879) uses Bernhardi's name, lunnite, for the group of minerals which have been included (see Min.) under pseudomalachite, on the hardly sufficient ground that the latter name suggests only the indistinctly crystalline or massive forms, which resemble malachite. For the crystalline varieties, which are pseudo-monoclinic (triclinic), have G. = 4-4, and correspond mostly to Cu.r,P2H4012, he uses the name dihydrite (D); they show no loss at 2(I0J. The names ehlite (E) and phosphorocalcite (P) he gives to the compounds Cu5P.H6013 andCuc,P,H60i4, respectively, and regards the three as entering in varying proportions to form the different massive varieties ; the latter have a lower specific gravity, and lose water on ignition at 200\u00b0.

Occurs sparingly at Branchville, Fairfield Co. , Conn. , inti mately associated with fillowite, fairfieldite, diei-nnsonite, in a vein of albitic granite. Black octahedral crystals, pseudomorphs after reddingite, are also found. Named from Redding, the name of the town in which the locality is situated. In crystalline form, reddingite is closely related to scorodite and strengite, but differs from them in composition, containing but three equivalents of water, and having the metals in the protoxide state.

Named from two specimens in the Oxford University collection, which have for fifty years gone by the name of blende, from Cornwall : exact source unknown. By a spec troscopic examination Lettsom has found it to give the absorption bands of didymium and erbium, and concludes that it is a phosphate of those bases. Boisbaudran remarks that monazite gives the same results with the spectroscope, so that rhabdophane might be a variety of that species. Bertrand finds that the mineral is uniaxial and positive (Bull. Soc. Min., iii., 58, 1880) ; an analysis gave : P.03 2770, Ce201(Di.03,La203) 07-20.

In his first paper, Genth gives five other analyses, made on material more or less impure. He also announces the vanadium as present as VeOn (= 2V.03 + V.05), but in the later publication regards it possible that it is all V203 ; he shows that the mineral is always more or less impure through mechanical admixture, and on this ground questions the correctness of Roscoe's results.

Sc. Press, June 25, 1881). Hanks remarks, that at the Granite Creek locahty, some 400 or 500 lbs. of the mineral have been discovered, which were wasted in the extraction of the gold. Genth also describes (1. c.) a mineral occurring in the Magnolia District, Colorado, as a thin earthy incrustation, of a grayish to olive green color on calaverite, also inclosed in quartz, and giving it a green color. An analysis of the quartz gave : Quartz 79 -38, Te 1 05, Au 0-03 = 80-46; the balance (19-5 p. e) is assumed to belong to the green mineral which forms the coloring matter.

Taking together the acid oxides of columbium (niobium), tantalum, tungsten, tin, and zirconium as M.Os, and reducing all the basic elements to the form RO, and neglecting the water, the ratio RO :M20!i = 221 : 100 is obtained, which corresponds to the formula: R3M208 + 4R2M207. Mallet prefers to include the water, making the hydrogen basic and deduces on this supposition the formula : R3M20\u00ab. This view, as he shows, is sup ported by the fact that in form sipylite is very near fergusonite. B. B. decrepitates, and glows brilliantly, becomes pale greenish yellow and opaque; in fusible. In the closed tube gives off acid water. With borax in O. F. gives a yellow bead, pale on cooling; in R. F. assumes a greener tint. Boiled in strong HC1 partially dissolves, the solution reacting for zirconium with turmeric paper; when metallic tin is added and the solution diluted, a sapphire blue color is obtained (columbium). Decomposed completely, though slowly, in boiling concentrated sulphuric acid. Occurs sparingly, im bedded in, or more commonly adherent to, masses of allanite and magnetite, at the north west slope of Little Friar Mountain, Amherst Co., Virginia.

The variety of spodumene from Alexander Co., N. C. (anal. 7, 8', occurs in prismatic crys tals from i inch to 3 inches in length; The crystals are often highly modified, show ing many planes not before observed on the species; they are often twins; the forms have been described by F. S. Dana, Am. J. Sc, III., xxil, 179. Perfectly transparent, and color from pale yellowish green to deep emerald green ; those of the latter color are highly valued as gems, having a peculiar brilliancy, as compared with the emerald, in consequence of the pleochroism ; the largest stone cut thus far weighs nearly 2 A carats. They occur in cavities in a gneissoid rock, with emerald (q. v), quartz, monazite, rutile, mica. The name hiddenite was given by Smith, after W. E. Hidden, through whom they have been intro duced as gems, and who has succeeded in finding them in place ; those first found (by J. A. D. Stephenson) were of a pale yellowish-^reen color, and were obtained loose in the overlying soil. The alteration of spodumene at Goshen and Chesterfield, Mass., has been studied by Julien, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sc, i., 318, 1879 ; that of the Branchville mineral has been investigated bv 67. J. Brush and E. S. Dana, Am, J. Sc, III., xx., 257, 1880 (or Z. Kryst, v., 192). According to Julien, the Chesterfield crystals are often of immense size, reaching a length of 35 inches, and a diameter of 10 or 11 inches (see above 4, 5, for analyses of unaltered material). Julien describes pseudomorphs after spodumene .of cymatolite, of killinite, of muscovite, of albite, of quartz, and of \"vein granite.\" The substance (see below) called cymatolite by Shepard, has a fibrous to wavy structure, silky lustre, white color; H. ;= L5-2; G. = 2-696-2'700.

Brush and Dana describe, from Branchville, Ct., pseudomorphs after spodumene, of a substance called ft spodumene (mixture of albite and eucryptite) of cymatolite (mixture of albite and muscovite), of albite, of microcline, of killinite, of \"vein granite.\" The orig inal crystals of spodumene (now mostly altered) were of great size, sometimes 4 feet long, 12 inches wide, and 2 to 4 inches thick. The unaltered spodumene occurring as a core in many large crystals is transparent, and either colorless or of a fine amethystine purple; for analysis see 6, above. The first product of the alteration, resulting from the exchange of Na for one-half the Li, is a. substance called si spodumene. It is compact, apparently homogeneous, with an indistinct fibrous to columnar structure. H. = 5-5-6. G. = 2'644-2'649. Color white, milky, or greenish white. Translucent. Fusibility, 2'25.

Soluble part 48'13 40'50 10-90 .... 0-47 .... = 100. 3. Insoluble part 68-18 20-07 .... 11-75 = 100. The whole has the composition (Li,Na)2Al2ShOi!I, orLi.Al2Si,Oe + Na2Al,Si60,6. The insoluble part is albite (Na,Al,Si6016); the soluble portion is a new mineral called eucryptite (sv, well, xpvjtro?, concealed), and has the composition Li,Al2 Si2Of. Examined under the microscope in thin sec tions (1) parallel to fibres, the irregular interlacing fibres of eucryptite are seen imbedded in albite; (2) transverse to fibres, the eucryptite forms bands with hexagonal outline (see figure), surrounded by albite, like quartz in a \" graphic granite.\" See also Eucryp tite, p. 44. The second stage in the alteration is cymatolite ; it results from ft spodumene, by the exchange of K for the remaining Li, that is, the change of eucryptite to muscovite. The cymatolite has a fibrous or wavy structure. G. =2'u9--2 699; color white or slightly pinkish. Two analyses by Penfield, of independent specimens, gave essentially identical results; one of these is: Si02 AL03 MnO Na20 K20 Li20 H20 (|) 60-55 26-38 0'07 812 334 0-17 165 = 100-28. 8"], [134, "114 APPENDIX III. This corresponds to: (Na,K,H)2Al2Si,012, or (K,H)2Al2Si2Os + Na2Al2Si60,n. The microscopic examination shows that cymatolite is not, as previously assumed, a simple mineral, but, corresponding to the formula, a very uniform me chanical mixture of muscovite and albite. In some sections the transitions from /j spodumene to cymatolite, i. e. , from eueryp tite to muscovite, are clearly seen. In other cases the muscovite and albite have each segregated together, so that they are dis tinct. For example, in the figure, s = unaltered spodumene, ji =/j spodumene, c = cymatolite, g = mica, a = albite. As further steps in the alteration there result : albite, often fibrous, like si spodumene, also muscovite, and granular micro cline. Still again pseudomorphs occur of killinite. This often retains the structure of the spodumene. The color is light bluish green, to oil green and dark grass green. Analyses: 1, Penfield, of variety showing prismatic structure ; 2, Dewey, of compact variety.

The examination of thin sections under the microscope showed a slight want of homo geneity, and also revealed a very fine scaly micaceous structure ; the killinite is doubtless to be regarded as an impure compact muscovite, like most other members of the pinite group.

Named from iuxvpa'Qoo, to be surprised, in allusion to the remarkable composition. Tornebohm (quoted by Lindstrom) states that the material analyzed was homogeneous under the microscope, having a fibrous structure. Bertrand (Bull. Soc. Min., iii., 159; iv., 8) states that he identified calcite, gypsum, and a third mineral, probably wollastonite, in thamnasite, and hence regards it as a mixture ; he states that chemical trials by Damour confirm this conclusion. Nordenskiold, however (Geol. For. Forh., v., 270, 1880), claims that Bertrand's observations were not made on the pure mineral, and that the mixture pro posed would not have the above composition. Finally, Cohen confirms by microscopic examination the essentially homogeneous (J. Min., 1881, ii., 21 res.) appearance; he sepa rated some gypsum and a carbonate soluble in acetic acid, but does not regard the matter as settled. A further critical examination is needed, in view of the seemingly very improb able composition deduced. Thenardite, Min., p. 615. \u2014 Province of Arequipa, Peru, Raimondi, Min.
