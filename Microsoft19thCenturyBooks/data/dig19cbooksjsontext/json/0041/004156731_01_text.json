In omitting to incorporate The Dominion of Wales in his Topographi cal Dictionary of England, the Author assigned as the Reason for so doing, that the Orthography of the Names and Appellatives in that part of the Kingdom appearing irregular, he could not prevail upon himself to throw them into Alphabetical form, without having attained some Knowledge of the Language and of the Country. He now ventures to present the Result of his Labours to the Public, pre facing his Work with certain explanatory Matter in the following Order; I. Of the Manner and Period, when the Principality of Wales be- came a Part of England, and afterwards attained definite Limits. II. Of the Method adopted to obtain accurate Information. III. Of the general Arrangement and Execution of the present Work. I. At the time of the Roman Invasion by Julius C\u00e6sar (54 years before the Birth of Christ), Britain is said to have been divided into Three Parts, one of them called Cambria. Certain it is, that what is now called Wales was then occupied by the Silures, the Dimet\u00e6, and the Ordovices. In process of Time the Romans extended their Conquests to this Part of the Island, which was formed into a Roman Province, called Britannia Secunda, bounded by the Severn and the Dee. After the departure of the Romans, this Province was disturbed by in testine Feuds, and subsequently by the predatory Incursions ofthe Saxons: But, as it naturally became the Retreat of the bravest of the Britons, remained unconquered, though lessened in extent by Ossa's Dike. The Appellation of Wales and Welshman was imposed by the Saxons,"], [16, "PREFACE. ii meaning in their Language, Stranger, or Foreigner. The Natives themselves acknowledge no other Name than Cymry, denoting their Origin from the great Family of the Cimbri. About the year 876, Rhodri Mawr or Roderic the Great, being Sov ereign of all Wales, divided his Dominion into three Parts, and left them severally to his three Sons. To Anarawd, he bequeathed the Sovereignty of Gwynedd or North Wales, then comprehending the Counties of Angle sea, Caernarvon, part of Merioneth, part of Denbigh, and part of Flint. To Cadell, he bequeathed the Sovereignty of Deheubarth or South Wales, then comprehending the Counties of Cardigan, Pembroke, Caermarthen, Glamorgan, part of Brecknock, part of Radnor, part of Gloucester, part of Hereford, and Gwent or the County of Monmouth. And to Merfyn, he bequeathed the Sovereignty of Powys, or The Middle Territory, then comprehending the County of Montgomery, part of Merioneth, part of Den bigh, part of Flint, part of Radnor, the Cantresof Buallt in the County of Brecknock, and part of the Counties of Chester and Salop. In the year 877, Merfyn being dispossessed by his brother Cadell, the Sovereignty of Powys and Deheubarth were united under his authority : and, on the death of Cadell, in the year 907, his son Hywel succeeded to his Dominions. Anarawd survived his Brother Cadell six years, dying in the year 913 ; when his Son Edwal, surnamed Foel or The Bald succeeded to the Sovereignty of North Wales; but, upon the death of Edwal, who was slain in the year 940, in an Engagement with the English and Danes, his Sons were superseded in the Government by their Kinsman Hywel, who, by this Acquisition, again united the three Principalities into one Government, and ruled as Sovereign of all Wales. The great attention paid by Hywel to the Public Weal, and the mild tenor of his Sway endeared him to his People, and obtained him the enviable distinction of Dda or The Good, by which he is generally known : This celebrated Prince died in the year 948. A horrid series of Domestic feuds afterwards occurred: and, in 1091, we find the Subjugation of Wales boldly determined upon by the enterprising spirit of Robert Fitzhamon, a Norman Baron, who having succeeded in the conquest of the great Lordship of Glamorgan, other Noblemen of the same Nation were induced to engage in similar Expeditions, in which they were equally for tunate. Hence the Establishment of the Lords of the Marches ! And to enable the English Lords to preserve the obedience of the People whom"], [17, "PREFACE. IX they had subdued, the Kings of England allowed them to assume, in their several Territories, an absolute Jurisdiction. From this Time, the Struggles ofthe brave and independent Natives hastened to a close. And, in 1283, Edward the First \" having at length reached the Point of his Ambition, in the entire Conquest of Wales, annexed that Country to the Crown of England.\" * From the Statutes respecting Wales in the reigns of Henry the Fourth and Henry the Sixth we find, that the Inhabitants were reduced to a state of Bondage the most severe and humiliating, until the reign of King Henry the Seventh. For, although the Policy of Edward the First had allowed the Welsh to enjoy their Liberties, and to hold their Estates under ancient Tenures, they had much reason to complain ofthe excessive rigour exercised over them by the Officers of Justice, and of the Rapacity of the English Lords who were settled in. Wales. f The Power of the Lords Marchers was still in full force, and had been exercised with such Rigour on the Welsh as to render an Act of Parliament necessary, in the 27\u00b0 Hen. VIII. cap. 5., A. D. 1536, to the following Pur- pose : \" Whereas many Robberies, Murders, and other evil Practices have been daily committed in the County Palatine of Chester, and Flintshire in Wales, and also in Anglesea, Caernarvon, Merioneth, Caerdigan, Caermar- then, Pembroke, and Glamorgan; because Justice is not administered there in such form as in other places of this Realm : for the remedy of this, it is enacted, that the Lord Chancellor of England, or Keeper of the Great Seal, shall nominate and appoint Justices of Peace, Justices of the Quorum, and Justices of the Gaol-delivery in the said Counties, and that they shall have like Power and Authority as those in England.\" This Statute in some measure lessened the Evils complained of, as it was the means of keeping Offenders in awe, who were thereby not able, as before, to escape, and to flee from one Lordship-Marcher to another: It also placed the Administra tion of Justice on a more stable foundation, and is in force to this day, in what is called The Great Sessions of Wales, holden by peculiar Judges. Another Evil had likewise arisen, which strongly marked the Oppression of the Times, to the Remedy of which a succeeding Statute was judged necessary, 27\u00b0 Hen. VIII. cap. 7, and was to the following effect: \" Whereas * Warrington's Hist, of Wales, p. 523. edit. 1786. 4to. t Wynne's Hist, of the Gwedir Family, pp. 30, 31, 34. b"], [18, "PREFACE. X in Wales and in the Marches, there are many Forests belonging either to the King or to the Lords Marchers, wherein sundry Actions have been committed for a long time, contrary to the Law of God and Man; insomuch, that if any Person entered the said Forests without a Token given him by any of the Foresters, as a Licence to pass, or unless he was a yearly Tributor or Chenser, he was forced to pay a grievous Fine ; and if he should chance to be found Twenty-four feet out of the Highway, he was then to forfeit all the Gold or Money which was found on his Person, and likewise a Joint of One of his Hands, unless he was fined for the Offence at the Discretion of the Forester, or Farmer ofthe same. And whereas likewise, if any Cattle strayed into the said Forests, it was the Custom of the Foresters to mark them for their own, with the Mark of the Forest.\" By this Statute, it was enacted, that People should be allowed to pass through these Forests as freely as in other places ; and that strayed Cattle, within a Year and a Day should be restored to the right Owners, they paying only a Compensation for the Herbage. These Statutes, restraining the Powers of the Lords Marchers, were some Years after succeeded by another Statute, which rendered those Lords no longer the objects of Terror, and entirely destroyed their Juridical Author ity. It was to the following effect: \" Whereas, by the Gifts ofthe Kings of England, many ofthe most ancient Prerogatives and Authorities of Just ice appertaining to the Imperial Crown ofthis Realm, have been severed and taken from the same ; it was then enacted, that no Person should have Power and Authority to pardon or to remit Treasons, Murders, Manslaughters, or any Felonies, or their Accessaries in any part of England, Wales, or in the Marches of the same : That likewise no person should make Justices of Oyer, Justices of Assize, Justices of Peace, or Justices of Gaol-delivery; but they should in future be made only by the King's Letters Patent: And that all Original Writs, Judicial Writs, and all manner of Indictments for Treason, Felony, and Trespass, and all manner of Process should be only made in the King's Name; and that all Offences committed against the Peace, should be considered as an Offence committed against the King, and not against the Peace of any other Person.\" The excessive Powers, an ciently vested in those Persons who enjoyed Counties Palatine, and Jura Regalia in the Lordship-Marchers, being thus taken away, a more regular and uniform course of Justice was established ; and in consequence, the"], [19, "PREFACE. XI Disorder and Mischief continually happening within these Precincts were in a great Measure prevented.* However, although these judicious and salutary Statutes had relieved the Welsh from many of their Sufferings, a National distinction was still pre served, and they yet remained as a separate People. They, therefore, in a memorable and manly Petition, solicited Henry the Eighth that he would extend his liberal Designs, and give them a still more complete Effect. And the King having considered the Loyalty of his Welsh Subjects, and the reasonable Nature of their claim, in the 27th Year of his reign, a Statute was enacted {cap. 26.), which entirely united Wales with his other Dominions. The Statute is to this effect : \" That as the Dominion, Principality, and Country of Wales is a Member and Part of the Temporal Crown of this Realm, whereof therefore the King is Head and Ruler ; yet as it hath divers Rights, Usages, Laws and Customs very different to the Laws and Customs of this Realm, and because the Language of that Country is different from that which is spoken here, and that many rude People hereupon have made distinction and diversity betwixt His Highnesses other Subjects, and them, to the causing of much Discord and Sedition ; His Highness therefore, out of his Love and Favour to his Subjects in Wales, and for reducing them to his Laws, doth, by Advice and Consent of his Parliament, ordain and enact, that Wales shall be united and incorporated henceforth to and with his Realm of England ; and that his Subjects in Wales shall enjoy and inherit all and singular Freedoms, Liberties, Rights, Privileges and Laws which His Highness's Subjects elsewhere enjoy and inherit. And therefore that inher itances shall descend after the manner of England, without Division or Partition, and not after any Tenure or Form of Welsh Laws or Customs. And forasmuch as there are divers Lordships Marchers within the said Country or Dominion in Wales, being no Parcel of any other Shires where the Laws and due Correction is used and had, and that in them and the Countries adjoining manifold Murders, Robberies, Felonies, and the like, have been done, contrary to all Law and Justice, because the Offenders, making their Refuge from one Lordship-Marcher to another, were and con tinued without Punishment and Correction. Therefore it is enacted, that the said Lordships-Marchers shall be united, annexed, and joined to divers Shires specified in the said Act.\" This Statute was put into immediate * Warrington, p. 56l. b2"], [20, "PREFACE. Xll Execution, and its Utility has been fully justified by the Experience of nearly Three Centuries. II. The Author is ignorant of any Works actually compiled for the Press, similar to the present, though from certain \" Parochial Queries,\" Thirty-one in Number, circulated by that eminent Antiquary and excel lent Scholar, The Rev. Edward Lhuyd, it appears, that he had contem plated such a Design, and had intended to illustrate both the Geography and Natural History of the Principality. In his Appeal to the learned and curious for their Assistance, he expresses himself with all that Diffidence which is peculiar to Merit; And, as if unconscious of his own great Name, and to render his Intention as free from Opposition or Neglect as possible, his printed Queries were supported by the Testimonial of The Rev. Dr. Wallis, Dr. Lister, The Rev. Mr. Bernard, and Mr. Ray, four celebrated Members of The Royal Society. The Answers were mostly returned in the Year 1698. And, in the early Volumes of The Philosophical Transac tions we find, \" Several Observations in Natural History, made in Travels through Wales,\" as communicated by Mr. Lhuyd. These Collections were deposited in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford : But several of the Answers were in a most flagitious Manner, some Years ago, torn out of the Volumes, in which they were pasted, by a Person who was afterwards characterized by the Name of Dr. Gome)'. The Author being sensible ofthe importance of his own Undertaking, took the liberty in like manner to solicit the aid of intelligent Persons throuoh out the Principality, and with this View circulated the following Letter and Questions subjoined to it, directed to the Officiating Minister of every Parish in the Dominion of Wales : And having thus procured valuable Materials far beyond his Expectations, and to which the Originality of the Work is entirely attributable, he flatters himself that it may pretend to as much accuracy as the Nature and Extent of it will allow."], [21, "PREFACE. xiii (CIRCULAR.)

Of this Letter One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Copies were printed and circulated : And, in the Month of November followin.o-, an Advertisement was inserted in all the Newspapers, which are in use through out Wales, respectfully thanking those Clergymen who had warmly and liberally promoted the Author's Inquiries, by their very satisfactory and copious Answers ;---repeating the Questions to those who might not have received the Circular Letter, or, who might not have had leisure to comply with his Request ; \u2014 and, at the same Time, inviting the Laity to co-operate in the completion of his Views. The Rev. Henry Thomas Payne of Llan Bedr, with a Liberality peculiar to himself, sent at once a description of the Deanery of the Third part of Brecknock, together with his valuable observations on the Pronunciation of the Welsh Letters. Other Friends tran-"], [23, "PREFACE. XV scribed the Questions for the use of the Clergy who had either mislaid, or not. received the Circular Letter. The Rev. Walter Davies, of Manafon, in the kindest manner requested Answers in his own Name. And latterly, The Rev. Samuel Rowlands, of Aber Ffraw, with true patriotic Zeal, gave publicity to them in the North Wales Gazette, most handsomely prefaced by a Letter of his own. It is a source of singular satisfaction in recording those Transactions to observe that, although the Author was a total Stranger in Wales, and strongly dissuaded against any reliance on the issue of these Topographical Questions, He nevertheless remained convinced of success, and the event has confirmed his Opinion of Public Sentiment. He can only by a pure and simple expression endeavour to convey his Gratitude and Respect, when he records, that concerning every Parish in the Dominion of Wales he has received not only Information, but from many of their worthy Ministers kind and encouraging Offers of additional Aid. In several of the Parochial Descriptions, the Author has availed himself of the Opportunity to mention with becoming Respect the Names of the Clergymen who contributed to them, thereby also giving Sanction to the Information now communicated. Moreover, lest any thing of consequence might have been omitted, as soon as the Descriptions of each County were compiled, the Manuscripts were then sent for revision to the following Gentlemen, who are well skilled in the Welsh Language, and conversant with their respective Counties.* ANGLESEA, to The Rev.

XVI The Author is ignorant of any better Method by which Accuracy could have been obtained ; and he dares not trust the fulness -of his Heart to ex press the Esteem and Gratitude which he feels, and ever shall feel, for such honourable, unprecedented, and zealous Support. III. The Orthography of the Name of each Parish, Township, and Hamlet, is given from an examination of the Returns made to Parliament in the Years 1776, 1786, 1801, compared with the Answers received on the Author's Circular Letter. Upon this point very particular Attention has been bestowed. To illustrate the tottering Fragments of an expiring Language, or to adjust the Orthography which Time has unsettled, is diffi cult and dangerous. The Attempt may not be successful, but surely some Merit is due in the endeavour to preserve from further corruption a Lan guage, wherein \" not only a great many Marks of the original Simplicity of the Hebrew\"* are found, but which hath a vast Number of Words, \" that either exactly agree with, or may be very naturally derived from, that Mother- Language of Mankind.\"! Purity of Diction is the ultimate Aim, and in that particular the excellent Welsh Dictionaries have afforded a sure Guide. But still, as \" many Words have likewise been altered by Accident, or depraved by Ignorance, as the Pronunciation of the Vulgar has been weakly followed ; and some still continue to be variously written, as Authors differ in their Care or Skill,\"! the Inquiry into the true Ortho graphy became indispensable. Hence the same Name is often entered twice, reference being made from what is considered the imperfect or Modern Orthography to the better or Ancient Mode, that those who search for them under either form, may not search in vain. It will be observed, that the compound Names are generally divided. This hath been done to show what are pure and simple Words, as well as to point more distinctly their Meaning. By a Division of Compound Words, we are further enabled to distinguish the Names of Saints, Princes, Heroes, Bards, and Rivers, and of marking more exactly those Names which are derived from their Locality, and which are, perhaps, better exemplified in Wales, than in any other Country. In the critical Remarks on Welsh Tours, in The Cambrian Register, it is not the least Praise conferred upon one Writer, \" that the * Preface to Richards's Antiq. Ling. Britan. Thesaur. p. xi. X Preface to Johnson's Dictionary of the Eng. Lan. p. 2, Quarto Edit. + Ibid,"], [25, "PREFACE. xvii Welsh Names are more properly spelled than by most other Travellers.\"* To those who are unaccustomed to view Subjects in a scientific manner, it will probably appear extraordinary that a proper, rather than an improper Mode of Spelling should so strongly be insisted upon. But, as Irregulari ties sometimes gain ground imperceptibly and without intention, and as it has been remarked that \" many Welsh Appellations and Local names have been so long corrupted, that it would be affectation to attempt to reform them,\"! the Author could do ho less than offer some Apology for the Plan which he has pursued. Yet further, \" whereas the word Lhan in the Names of Churches,\" says Mr. Lhuyd to Bishop Gibson, \" is commonly joined with that which follows, as Llanelian, Lhaniestin, &c, I thought it better Ortho graphy to separate it, writing Llan Elian, which signifies St. Elian's Church, and Llan Jestin, i. e., St. Jestin's.\"^. And lastly, it may be noticed, that, in the. Parochial Descriptions in \" The Cambrian Register,\" great care in the Spelling of Welsh Words is invariably observed. In ascertaining the Ancient Cantrefs, which are synonymous in most respects with our Hundreds, and their Subdivisions into Cwmwds or Commu nities, the Map of the Ancient Divisions of Gwynedd, Powys, aw^Dinefawr, drawn up by William Owen, Esq. (now William Owen Pughe), of Den bigh, for the purpose of accompanying the Second Edition of The Rev. Mr. Warrington's History of Wales, has been used; and who also kindly ap proved of the Plan of this Work, which is so frequently enriched by Mr. Pughe's useful and judicious Observations. If it should be asked, why those Appellations, which have been suffered to change since the reign of Henry the Eighth, should now be revived? the Author replies, that those Ancient Divisions have never been wholly obliterated, and are even now prominent in many of the Answers to his Circular Letter. \"The present Divisions of Wales, consisting of Thirteen Counties (now of Twelve, Mon mouth being considered an English County), were settled on the Introduc tion of the English Laws into the Country. In these the Ancient Cantrev and its Subdivisions were preserved generally.\"^ And what is not commonly known, many of the Deaneries still carry along with them the original Name of the Cantrefs, in which they are comprised. That they are also in modern use, may be gathered from the circumstance ofthe present Earl of Oxford * Vol. ii. p. 453. t Jones's History of the County of Brecknock, vol. ii. part I. p. xi. - X Gough's Camden's Britannia, vol. ii. p. 467. \u00a7 Cambrian Register, vol. i. p. 288.

To prevent, however, any Perplexity that might arise from this Revival of the old Divisions, the modern Names of the Hundreds in which the several Parishes are judicially known, are always expressed along with them. In the Laws of Hywel Dha, or Howel the Good, we cannot proceed without meeting with Cantrefs and Comots, where it was a special Pferogative of the King \" to fix their Bounds:'' and where, among the Royal Courts, were \" the Courts of Cantrefs,\" and \" Courts of Comots.\" In The Extent* of Edward the Third (in 1352), they every where prevail.

LI., is L, aspirated, and has a Sound peculiar to the Welsh Language, as written in English, Llh: in composition the LI is expressed by the single L., as Llaw, a Hand, ei Lair, his Hand. M., as M.

P., as P English. Ph., as Ph English. The true difference, between the Ff and Ph., is, that such Words as are purely British are written with Ff, as Fson, a Staff, Ffrdd, a Way ; or such words as are derived from the Latin, as Ffydd, Faith, Ffenestr, a Window : but such Words as have the radical P are changed into the aspirate Ph, as ei Phen, his Head : it is mutable into b, mh, and ph, as Pen, a Head, ei Ben, his Head ; fy Mhen, my head ; ei Phen, her head.

In the Counties of Glamorgan, Brecknock, and Monmouth, U is pronounced as the English / in miss ; but in the Counties of Caermarthen and Cardigan, more like the English U : thus, the River Dulas, which separates the Counties of Caermarthen and Glamorgan is pronounced on the one side as if written in English Dullas, and on the other side as if Avritten Dillas. V., consonant, is expressed in Welsh by the Letter F. W., is variously used in Welsh ; sometimes as the English W, as in Wedi, after, Wele, behold, Weithian, at length : also, as oo, in the English good, Hood; thus, Pwn, a Burden, Pwll, a Pool: if circumflexed, as oo in Mood, Rood ; thus, Cwd, a Bag, Drwg, bad, Mwg, Smoke. X., no Letter in the Welsh Alphabet : in writing foreign Words Ecs is used, as Ecsodus, i. e., Exodus. Y., in any Syllable of a Word, except the last, is pronounced as the English U, in burn, churn, hunt : but in the last Syllable of a Word, whether the Word consists of one or more Syllables, as the English /, in din, fin, sin ; thus, Cyn, before, Llyn, a Lake ; except that in these Monosyllables y, ydd, yn, fy, dy, myn, it retains its former sound of U, in burn. The two Sounds of Y are represented nearly in the English word sundry, and entirely in the Welsh words Hynny, Ystyr, Llythyr, Mybyr, and Pybyr. When the Y is circumflexed, it has one and the same Sound with the circumflexed u ; thus, Byd, the World, is pronounced as Beed, and Mud, dumb, as Meed. Z., no Letter in the Welsh Alphabet. N. B. The Accent is, in all Welsh words, either on the last Syllable or on the Penultima, never on the Ante-penultima ; but it is much more frequently on the Penultima, and when on the last Syllable it is a Circumflex. d 2"], [36, ""], [37, "[ xxix ] GLOSSARY; OR, EXPLANATION OF SOME OF THOSE WELSH WORDS WHICH MOST FRE QUENTLY OCCUR IN COMPOSITION WITH THE NAMES OF PLACES.

The harbour is not sufficiently large or commodious for the utmost extent of trade, of which the place, from its situation, is capable ; the bar, at its entrance, preventing ships of any considerable burden from enter ing, except in spring tides, when there is about fourteen feet of water. The trade, which it carries on at present, is in the exportation of lead, calamine, oak bark, and corn, and a few manufactured goods to Bristol and Liverpool. The coast is grand, and the marine prospect particularly fine. The bathing here is well conducted : and, in general, there is a good sandy bottom at all hours of the tide, notwithstanding the beach is wholly composed of pebbles. The Duke of Leeds, as Lord of the Manor of Faenor, has a duty of five shillings per ton on coals carried coastwise, which was first granted by King Charles the Second. It derives its name from being built exactly opposite the Aber, or Mouth of the river Ystwith, i. e., where it falls into the river RJieidiol. The History of the Castle is interesting : It is said to have been the residence ofCadwaladyr, the last King of the Britons : in 1 109, when Cadwgan ap Bleddyn's dominions were bestowed on Gilbert Strongbow, Earl of Strigil, this fortress fell of course to C2"], [60, "ABE his possession : in 1116, Grufydd ap Rhys laid siege to it, but was dreadfully handled by Ralph Steward: in U35, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladyr, his brother, in revenge for their sister's murder by Maurice de Londres, destroyed this castle, which was very strong, and well garrisoned. It seems, however, to have been soon repaired or rebuilt by Cadwaladyr, who is styled, Lord of Cardigan, and had his usual residence in this castle, until the unnatural rencontre between him and his son-in-law, Anarod ap Grufydd : \" Animosus Anarawd a Socero c\u00e6sus.\" Pentarchia. when it was burnt down by his brother, Owain Gwynedd. In 1208, Maelgon ap Rhys, being apprehensive of an hostile visit from Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, and despairing of making any stand against him, demolished this his castle: it was rebuilt by Llywelyn : in 1211, King John having subdued all Wales, on his departure, charged Foulke, Viscount Caerdiff, Warden ofthe Marches, to oblige Rhys and Owain ap Grufydd ap Rhys to surrender this castle, with which they complied ; and it was fortified by the Warden, but soon re-taken and demolished by Maelgon and Rhys Fychan : In 1222, Rhysap Grufydd, having differed with Llywelyn ap Jorwerth respecting a division of property, united his forces to those ofthe Earl of Pembroke, which so irritated Llywelyn, that he took his castle of Aber Ystwith and all its dependences : from this period history is silent, until the year 1277, when Rhys ap Meredydd ofthe Royal House of South Wales, surrendered the strong fortress of Ystrad Tywy to Edward the First, who, for the better defence of his newly acquired possessions, erected a castle at Aber Ystwith, which was taken, in 1282, by Rhys ap Maelgon and Grufydd ap Mere dydd ap Owain, with other Noblemen of South Wales : It was taken by the Prince of Wales, during the insurrection of Owain Glandwr ; but soon re-taken by Owain, who garrisoned it strongly with his brave, though deluded, countrymen : A gentleman of the name of Bushel, Proprietor of the Lead Mines in this neighbourhood, obtained of King Charles the First the privilege of setting up a Mint in this castle, for the payment of his Miners: Mr. Bushel, out of grati tude for the favour, when the civil war broke out, cloathed the King's whole army, and furnished his Majesty a Loan (which was considered as a gift) of Forty thousand pounds ; and when that unfortunate Prince was pressed by the Parliament, he raised him a regiment among his Miners, at his own charge : It was finally garrisoned by the Usurper Cromwell.

The old Church stood to the West ofthe town: The present church was erected by sub scription.

At the Wug, on the North side of the town, a capital harbour, according to Mr. Morris, might be made, by running a pier out on the ridge of the rocks, which may be effected at the expense of about \u00a3.0,000: this would then be the best situation on the coast of Wales, for the station of packets between England and Ireland.

D., then Lord Bishop of Bangor, and now of St. Asaph. The Parish is about seven miles in length, and all the North-east side of Llannerch y Medd is within it. To the curacy of Amlwch were formei ly annexed three Chapels of Ease, one of which only, viz., Llan Gwenllwyfo, is now standing, and where Divine Service is performed once a fortnight, but formerly once in three weeks when the other two chapels were entire: these have both been in ruins many years ; one was called Llan Lleianan, i. e., The Cell of the Nunsi which is situate about four miles West from Amlwch near Llan Badrig, and the foundation ofthe church and part of the churchyard wall are still to be seen ; the other is about the same distance South from Amlwch, and was called Llan Cadog, the roof whereof was up in the memory of some ofthe old inhabitants of the place; it is near a place, called City Dulas. According to Mr. Morris, the Port of Amlwch is but a small creek, two miles to the West of Elian Point and Light-house ; it is no more than a cove between two steep rocks, where a vessel has hardly room to wind even at hia;h water. The Parys Mine Company has been at very considerable expense in making it a safe Harbour, and a large vessel might be saved here, in case of necessity, provided the mouth of the Harbour could be discovered, which is difficult for a stranger to find ; there are two small white houses for land marks, one on each side of the dock, which have lights in them at night, that make the entrance more conspicuous. The Easternmost Mouse, a small island near the place, is a good direction till you come close to shore.

The external aspect of the hill is extremely rude, and rises into enormous rocks of coarse white quartz. The ore is lodged in a bason, or hollow, and has on one side a small lake, on whose waters, distasteful as those of Avernus, no bird is known to alight. The whole aspect of"], [64, "A M L this tract has, by the mineral operations, assumed a most savage appearance. Suffocating fumes ofthe burning heaps of copper arise in all parts, and extend their baneful influence for miles around. In the adjacent parts vegetation is nearly destroyed ; even the mosses and lichens of the rocks have perished : and nothing seems capable of resisting the fumes but the purple Melic grass (Melica c\u00e6rulea), which flourishes in abundance.\u2014 I have little doubt but that the ore had been worked in a very distant period. Vestiges of the ancient operations appear in several parts, carried on by trenching, and by heating the rocks intensely, then suddenly pouring on water, so as to cause them to crack, or scale; thus aukwardly supplying the use of gunpowder. Pieces of charcoal were also found, which prove that wood was made use of for that purpose. As the Britons imported all works in brass, it is certain that the Romans were the undertakers of these mines ; and it is very probable that they sent the ore to Caer Hen to be smelted, the place where the famous cake of copper was discovered. They might likewise have had a smelting-hearth in this island ; for a round cake of copper was discovered at Llan Faethlu, a lew miles from this place : its weight was fifty pounds, and it had on it a mark resembling an L. \u2014 In the year 1762, one Alexander Fraziercame into Anglesea in search of mines. He visited Parys Mountain; called on Sir Nicholas Bayley, and give him so flatter ing an account ofthe prospect, as induced him to make a trial, and sink shafts. Ore was discovered ; but before any quantity could be gotten, the mines were over powered with water. In about two years after, Messrs. Roe and Company, of Macclesfield, applied to Sir Nicholas for a lease of Penrhyn ddu mine in Caer narvonshire ; with which they were, much against their wills, compelled to take a lease of part ofthis mountain, and to carry on a level, and make a fair trial. The trial was accordingly made: Ore was discovered; but the expenses over balanced the profits. They continued working to great loss: and at length determined to give the affair up. They gave their agent orders for that pur pose ; but he, as a final attempt, divided his men into ten several companies, of three or four in a partnership, and let them sink shafts in various places, about eight hundred yards eastward of a place, called The Golden Venture, on a pre sumption that a spring, which issued from near the place, must come from a body of mineral. This conjecture was right; for in less than two days they met with, at the depth of seven feet from the surface, the solid mineral, which proved to be that vast body which has since been worked to such advantage. The day that this discovery was made was, the 2d of March 1768 ; which has"], [65, "A M L ever since been observed as a festival by the miners. Soon after this discovery, another adventure was begun by The Rev. Edward Hughes, owner of part of the Mountain, in right of his wife, Mary Lewis, of Llys Dulas; so that the whole of the treasure is the property of Viscount BuLKEE-E^and himself. \u2014 The body of copper ore is of unknown extent. The thickness has been ascer tained, in some places, by the driving of a level under it, several years ago, and it was found to be in some places twenty-four yards. The ore is mostly of the kind, called by Cronsted, Pyrites cupri flavo viridescens ; and contains vast quan tities of sulphur. It varies in degrees of goodness ; some of it is rich, but the greater part poor in quality. \u2014 There are other species of copper ore found here. Of late a vein of Pyrites cupri griseus, of Cronsted, about seven yards wide, has been discovered near the West end of the mountain: some is of an iron grey, some quite black ; the first contains sixteen pounds of copper per hundred pounds, the last forty. An ore has been lately found, in form of loose earth, of a dark purplish colour; and the best of it has produced better than eight in twenty. Some years ago, above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbary ; some was in form of moss, some in very thin leaves. \u2014 It is quarried out of the bed in vast masses ; is broken into small pieces, and the most pure part is sold raw, at the rate of about \u00a33. to \u00a36. per ton, or sent to the smelting-houses of the respective Companies to be melted into metal. Mr. Hughes has great furnaces of his own at Ravenhead, near Liverpool, and at Swansea, in South Wales. \u2014 The more impure ore is also broken to the size of about hens' eggs ; but in order to clear it from the quantity of sulphur with which it abounds, as well as other adventitious matter, it must undergo the operation of burning. For that purpose it is placed between two parallel walls of vast length ; some Kilns are twenty, others forty, and fifty yards in length ; some ten, others twenty feet wide, and above four feet in height. The space between is not only filled, but the ore is piled many feet higher, in a convex form, from end to end : the whole is then covered with flat stones, closely luted with clay ; and above is placed a geneial integument of clay and small rubbish of the work, in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating. Of late some Kilns have been constructed with brick arches over the ore, which is found to be the best method of burning. Within these few years, attempts are made to preserve the sulphur from flying away ; and that is done by flues, made of brick, whose tops are in form of a Gothic Church many scores of feet in length: one end of these opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt. Those D"], [66, "A M L, beds are set on fire by a very small quantity of coal, for all the rest is affected by its own Phlogiston. The volatile part is confined, and directed to the flues : in its course the sulphureous particles strike against their roofs, and fall to the bottom in form of the finest brimstone ; which is collected, and carried to ad- jacent houses, where it is melted into what is called in the shops, Stone brim- stone. \u2014 The beds of copper thus piled for burning, are of vast extent. Some contain four hundred tons of ore, others two thousand. The first require four months to be completely burnt ; the last, near ten. Thus burnt, it is carried to proper places to be dressed, or washed, and made merchantable. By this process the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity, but considerably im- proved in quality : and by this means the water is strongly or richly impreg- nated with copper, which is dissolved by the acid quality of the sulphur : and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the above described pits. The iron is all dissolved. \u2014 But a far richer produce of copper is discovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore, which is highly saturated with the precious metal. This is drawn up either by means of Whimsies, or Wind- mills, to the surface, and then distributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirty-six feet long, some pits more, some less, twelve to fifteen feet broad, and twenty inches deep. To speak in the language of the adept, Venus must make an assignation with Mars, or this solution will have no effect. In plain English, a quantity of iron must be immersed in the water. The kind of iron is of no moment; old pots, hoops, anchors, or any refuse will suffice : but of late, for the convenience of management, the adventurers procure new plates, four feet long, one and a half broad, and three quarters of an inch thick. These they immerse into the pits ; the particles of copper instantly are precipitated by the iron, and the iron is gradually dissolved into a yellow ocher ; great part of it floats off by the water, and sinks to the bottom. The plates, or the old iron (as it happens) are frequently taken out, and the copper scraped off ; and this is repeated till the whole ofthe iron is consumed. The copper, thus pro- cured, differs little from native copper, and is prized accordingly, and sold for prices of \u00a325- to \u00a345. a ton. \u2014 The ore is not got in the common manner of Mining, but is cut out ofthe bed in the same manner as stone is out of a quaYry. A hollow is now formed in the solid ore open to the day, and extends about one hundred yards in length, about forty yards in breadth, and twenty-four yards in depth. The ends are at present undermined, but supported by vast pillars and magnificent arches, all metallic ; and these caverns meander far under"], [67, "A M L ground. These will soon disappear, and thousands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs. The sides of this vast hollow are mostly perpendicular; and access to the bottom is only to be had by small steps cut in the ore ; and the curious visitor must trust to them and a rope, till he reaches some ladders, which will conduct him the rest of the descent. On the edges ofthe chasms are wooden platforms, which project far : on them are wind lasses, by which the workmen are lowered to transact their business on the face ofthe precipice. There suspended, they work in mid air, pick a small space for a footing, cut out the ore in vast masses, and tumble it to the bottom with great noise. In such situations they form caverns, and there appear safely lodged, till the rope is lowered to convey them up again. Much of the ore is blasted with gunpowder, eight tons of which, I am informed, are annually used for the purpose. \u2014 Nature hath been profuse in bestowing her Mineral savours on this spot; for above the copper ore, and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common soil, is a bed of yellowish greasy clay, from one to four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from six hundred to a thou sand pounds weight of lead from one ton: and one ton ofthe metal yields not less than fifty seven ounces of silver. Mixed with the earth, are frequently certain parts of the color of Cinnabar; whether these are symptomatic ofthe sulphureous arsenical silver ores, or of quicksilver, I will not pretend to decide. Something interferes with the successful smelting ofthis earth in the great: insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adventurers, which might reasonably be expected from the crucible assays of it : and they have at this time about eight thousand tons on bank undisposed of. This place has been worked for lead ore in very distant times. In the botton of the pool was found an ancient smelting-heai th of grit-stone, and several bits of smelted lead, ofabout four inches in length, two in breadth, and half an inch thick These works have added greatly to the Population of the Island ; for about Fifteen hundred persons are employed, who, with their families, are supposed to make near eight thousand persons, getting their bread from these Mines. The little Village of Amlwch, the Port of the place, is increasing fast, and the Market grows considerable. At the season of the greatest work, Mr. Hughes' s men alone receive, for many weeks, \u00a3200. in one week, and \u00a3l50. in another, merely lor subsistence. The Port is no more than a great chasm between two rocks, running far into land, and dry at low water ; into which sloops run, and lie secure to receive their lading.\" \u2014 Pennant's Tour in Wales, vol.lh pp. 265 \u2014 272.

Upon his return into Scotland, he made Asaph, an eminently holy and good man, his successor, and from him both the Church and Place have since been called St. Asaph. But from the death of St. Asaph, A. D. 596, there is no account of the Monastery, and little or no account of any Bishops till the year 1143. And though there hath been a constant and regular succession from that time, yet, by reason of the wars between the"], [70, "AST English and the Welsh, and Owain Glandwr's rebellion, the Cathedral Church, with the Bishop's and Canons' Houses were more than once destroyed, and lor many years in ruins.

Close to the South-east end of the Town, is a great artificial Mount, called Tommeny Bala, which appears to have been Roman, and placed here, with a Castelet on its summit, to secure the Pass towards the Sea, and keep the neighbourhood in subjection. Bala is said to take its Name from its vicinity to the place, where a River discharges itself from a Lake. At the upper end of this Lake is the Roman Station of Caer Gai, situate on a gentle eminence close to the road side.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and of the same extent in breadth ; and is mostly uncultivated. To the South-east of the Cathedral is an old Building, which is said to have been formerly a Chapel. The Tythes are appropriated to the Church of Bangor. An ancient inscribed stone, in ho nour of Antoninus, was discovered near Ty Coch, in this Parish, in the year 1807. A Bishoprick was probably erected here before the middle ofthe Sixth Cen tury by Maelgwyn or Malgo Conan, Prince of North Wales ; and Deiniol, the son of Dunod ab Pabo, who had before founded a College or Monastery here, was made E"], [74, "BAN the first Bishop. We have very little or no account of the Monastery afterwards, andbut an imperfect one ofthe Bishops, until theyear 1039- Afterwhich time there appears to have been a regular succession of Prelates in this See : though, by reason ofthe wars, they had not all ofthem a quiet enjoyment. OwainGlandwr greatly de faced the Cathedral ; but Bishop Dean, in 1496, repaired it again. This See is said, however, to have met a still more cruel ravager than Owain GIandwrr in the person of Bishop Bulkeley, in 1 54 1, who not only alienated many of the lands be longing to it, but even sold the bells of the Church. This Diocese contains the whole of the County of Caernarvon, except three Parishes, the county of Anglesea, and part of the counties of Denbigh, Merioneth, and Montgomery. It has three Archdeaconries, viz., Aglesea, Bangor, and Merioneth ; of which, the two first are commonly annexed to the Bishoprick, for its better support. The Revenues ofthis See, 26\u00b0 Hen.

According to Bishop Tanner, here was a very ancient Monastery, which Bede and others mention as being very flou- rishing at the coming of St. Augustine : and it must have been so, if, as all our writers, except the Publisher of King \u00c6lfred's life, report, that \u00c6thelfrid King of the Angles, in his wars with the Britons in the beginning of the Seventh Century, slew near 1200 of them for praying for the successes their Country- men and Fellow Christians against the Saxon Infidels. After which time, it probably went to decay ; for William of Malmsbury, Avho lived shortly after the Norman Conquest, saith, There remained only in his time the footsteps of so great a place, so many ruinous Churches, and such heaps of rubbish, as were hardly elsewhere to be met with.

According to Mr. Morris, Bardsey Island being very high on the Southern side, is the first land generally rnade in St. George's Channel ; and it is allowed by most Commanders of Ships, that if a Light-house was erected thereon, it would be the means of saving abundance of Vessels that are continually lost in the neighbourhood, owing to the Causeway, and the Sand-banks near the Island, and it would be a good guide to the capital Road of St. Tudwal' s. The whole Island is a very fertile Plain, well cultivated, and productive of every thing which the Main land affords. The Abbot's House is a large stone Building, inhabited by se veral of the Natives: not far from it is a singular Chapel or Oratory, being a long arched edifice, with an insulated stone altar near the East end. In this place one of the Inhabitants reads Prayers : all other offices are performed at Aber Daron. This Island is about two miles in circumference, and is rented from Lord Newborough. \u2014 \" In this small Island was a very ancient Religious House, founded before the year 516. For Dubricius, Archbishop of Caerleon, having about that time resigned his Archbishoprick, retired hither. I' can give no account of the Founder, but it was generally called an Abbey, and is said to have produced a great number of Holy men.

It is pleasantly situate on the banks of the river Maw, which here discharges itself into St. George's Channel: and is a well frequented Sea-bathing place, provisions of all sorts being cheap, and in great plenty. This Harbour, according to Mr. Morris, is the best Bar harbour in Wales, but the Mountains are so high about it, that Land-marks would be of no use in foggy weather; a Buoy is really wanted at each Bar. Up the river, near Dolgellau, there is Iron-stone in great abundance ; some attempts have been made to manufacture it, but it did not succeed through want of skill ; and near this place is one ofthe greatest veins of Marcasite or Sulphur, containing some small veins of Copper ore. The Petty Sessions are holden here. The Ford at this place, discovered by Malgo, no longer exists. BARON HILL, v. LLAN FAES.

According to Sir Richard Colt Hoare, it contains 300 acres of land, let at the annual Rent of \u00a380., and with only one House annexed ; which, during the summer months, is fitted up as a Boarding-house for the reception of Sea bathers, and will accommodate about twelve people. The Island maintains a few Sheep and Cows, and has a large Rabbit Warren. On the Western side of the Island, facing the little village of Barry, are the remains of an ancient"], [78, "BAT Castle, and also of two old Chapels : and towards the Southward, on a spot called Nell's Point, is a fine Well, to which great numbers of Women resort on Holy Thursday, and having washed their eyes at the Spring, each drops a Pin into it. A carriage may pass over the narrow Creek which separates the Island from the Main-land, at low water ; but the Road leads over a very rough bank of pebbles. Lead and Calamine are said to have been found here. BASINGWERK, in the Cwmwd of Cynsyllt, Cantref of Tegeingl (now called the Hundred of Coleshill), Co. of Flint, North Wales; in the Parish of Holywell. It is 1 m. East from Holywell. This Castle was of importance in the wars between the English and Welsh. The land towards the Sea is steeply sloped: the West side was protected by a deep gully, formed by the River : aud the South-east by the vast Ditch, called Wat's Dike. Vestiges of the Fortress appear in the Foundation of a Wall on the edge ofthe Ditch, and on the road side, near the Turnpike Gate, opposite to the ruins of the Abbey. Lord Lyt telton says, that the Founder was an Earl of Chester. In 1165, the gallant Prince Owain Gwynydd laid siege to it, took and levelled it to the ground; after which the Name occurs no more as a Fortress. According to Bishop Tanner, Ranulph, Earl of Chester, seems to have begun a Monastery here about the year 1131, which was probably much improved and made an Abbey for Cistertian Monks by King Henry the Second, about the year 1159. It was dedicated to St. Mary, had lands and possessions, 26\u00b0 Hen. VIII., ofthe yearly value of \u00a3150-7-3 as Dugdale, and \u00a31.57-15-2 as Speed ; and was granted, 32\u00b0 Hen.

There are still some considerable remains of it. Archbishop Baldwyn lodged here one night, on his progress through Wales to preach the Crusade. The Grange is at present a Farm-house, and still retains its ancient name.

It is situate on the Banks of the River Yscyr. The Tradition of the Country is, that this Parish took its Name from a Battle, in which Rhys ab Tewdwr, Prince of South Wales, was"], [79, "B E A defeated and slain by Robert Fitzhamon, aided by Jestyn ab Gwrgant, Lord of Glamorgan. In confirmation of which, the Inhabitants point out a Well, called Ffynnon Pen Syr Rhys, or, The Well of the Head of Sir Rhys. This Battle took place previous to the Invasion of Brecknock by Bernard de Newmarch, who, therefore, could not have influenced the Name. Indeed, the whole story is too vague and unsupported by Historical documents to be implicitly depended upon. The greater probability is, that the Parish has been so called from the Chapel, quasi Cappel y Battel, i. e. Capella de Battel, given it by the Prior and Monks of Brecknock, in honour of their Mother Church St. Martin de Battel, in the County of Sussex, to which Abbey the Priory of Brecknock was constituted a Cell by Bernard de Newmarch, its Founder. The Rev. Thomas Watkins, of Pennoyre House, in this Parish, is the Impropriator. According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Augmentation, fixed Stipend, and Surplice Fees, was \u00a347-5-0. It has neither Parsonag-e-house, or Glebe.

This Town sends one Member to Parliament; the Mayor is the Returning Officer, and the right ofElection is in the Mayor and capital Burgesses. It is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, two Bailiffs, twenty-one Burgesses, a Town Clerk, and two Sergeants at Mace. A new Road has lately been made from Beaumaris to Porth Aethwy or Bangor Ferry, four miles in length, on the' side of a sloping Hill above the beautiful navigable Strait of Menai, which separates the Counties of Anglesea and Caernarvon. This Road was made at the expense of Viscount Bulkeley, and the Bridge over the river Cad Nant by the County. According to Mr. Morris, this was a place of good trade formerly, and might be so now, if the Inhabitants pursued it, the Harbour being large, safe, and well situated; vessels may enter it at any time ofthe tide, by the West passage. A buoy is much wanted, which with the Perch on The Horse, would be sufficient directors in the day time to the Cross Road. To sail to the Friars Road, which is about a league from the Cross Road, keep sight of the top of the Tower on Priestholme Island, that it be not covered by the hio*h end of the Island, and it will carry you clear of all dangers, on the Anglesea side. In the Night, or a Fog, take your Soundings from Lavan Sands on your Larboard hand. When you open the Lane by Friars House, you may anchor in six Fathoms, stiff clay ground, or lie aground in soft Mud. The Town of Beaumaris is, as the name implies, according to Mr. Pennant, pleasantly seated on a low land at the water's edge ; is neat, and well built, and one Street is very hand some. Edward the First created the place ; for, after founding the Castles of Caernarvon and Conway, he discovered that it was necessary to put another curb upon the Welsh. He built this Fortress in 1295, and fixed on a marshy spot, near the Chapel of St Meugan (now demolished), such as gave him op portunity of forming a great Foss round the Castle, and of filling it with water from the Sea. He also cut a Canal, in order to permit Vessels to discharge their Lading beneath the Walls: and, as a proof of the existence ofsuch a con-"], [81, "B E A veniency, there were within this Century iron rings affixed to them, for the purpose of mooring the Ships or Boats. The Marsh was in early times of far greater extent than at present, and covered with fine Bullrushes. Within the Walls ofthe Castle on one side is a beautiful Chapel, inform cf a Theatre, the sides ornamented with Gothic arches, and the roof supported by ribs springing from elegant Pilasters; between each of which is a narrow window, and behind some are small closets, gained out of the thickness of the Wall, probably al- lotted to the Officers, or persons of Rank. A narrow gallery runs within the \u25a0whole space ofthe Castle Walls. The entrance faces the Sea ; and near it isa long narrow advanced work, called The Gunner's Walk. The first Governor was Sir William Pickmore, a Gascon Knight, appointed by Edward the First. There was a Constsble of the Castle, and a Captain of the Town : The first had an annual Fee of Forty pounds, the last of \u00a312-3-4 : and the Porter of tha Gate of Beaumaris had \u00a39. .2-6. Twenty-four Soldiers were allowed for the guard ofthe Castle and Town, at four-pence a day to each. The Constable of the Castle was always Captain of the Town, except in one instance ; in the 36\u00b0 of Henry the VI., Sir John Boteler held the first office, and Thomas Norreys the other. The Castle was extremely burdensome to the Country: quarrels were frequent between the Garrison and the Country people. In the time of Heniy the Sixth, a bloody fray happened, in which David ap Evan ap Howel of Llwydiarth, and many others, were slain. From the time of Sir Rowland Villeville, alias Brittayne, reputed base Son of Henry the Seventh and Con- stable ofthe Castle, the Garrison was withdrawn till the year I642, when Thomas Cheadle, Deputy to the Earl of Dorset, then Constable, put into it men and ammunition. In 1643, Thomas Bulkeley, Esq., soon after created Lord Bulkeley, succeeded : his Son, Colonel Richard Bulkeley, and several Gentlemen of the Country, held it for the King till June IC46, when it surrendered on honourable terms to General Mytton, who made Captain Evans his Deputy Governor. In 1653, the annual expense of the Garrison was \u00a31703. Edward the First, when he built the Town, surrounded it with Walls, made it a Corporation, and endowed it with great Privileges, and Lands to a considerable value. He removed the ancient Freeholders, by exchange of property, into other countries. Hen Llys, near the Town, was the Seat of Gwerydd ap Rhys Goch, one of the Fifteen Tribes, and of his posterity till this period, when Edward removed them to Boddle Wyddan in Flintshire, and bestowed their ancient Patrimony on the Corporation. Its first Representative was Maurice Gryffydd, who sat in the 7th year of Edward the Sixth. The Right Hon. Lord Bulkeley is Constable of the F"], [82, "BED Castle.

In the early period of his Life he enjoyed the munificent Patronage of If or the Generous, an ancestor of the Tredegar Family. What signalized his life the most, arose from his passion for the fair Morfudd, under the influence of which he com posed 147 Poems, addressed to her. But, after all, he failed of obtaining her hand, though their love was mutual ; for her friends sought to render her happy by a wealthy connection, rather than listen to the persuasive eloquence of his Muse. She was therefore married to Rhys Gwgan, an Officer who served in the English army, in the celebrated battle of Cressy, in the year 1346. Dafydd ab Gwilym seduced Morfudd 'to elope with him, during the absence of her husband in France ; and, in consequence of such a breach ofthe Laws, he was put in prison. He was soon liberated, however, by the influence ofthe principal people of the Counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth ; to whom, in return for their good offices, he composed a most beautiful Poem. The Works of Dafydd ab Gwilym were printed in London, in 1789, edited by Owen Jones and William Owen.

The Rectorial Tythes are annexed to the See of Bangor. In the Sixteenth Volume of Archaeologia page 127, is a descrip tion of Roman Antiquities discovered here, by Samuel Lysons. Esq., whose"], [113, "C A E Taste, Judgment, and Accuracy are so universally known : \u2014 All writers, says this Gentleman, on the Subject of the Roman Stations in this Island, agree in opinion that Caerhun, a small Village on the river Conwy, is the Site of the ancient Conovium: a Station which occurs in the Eleventh Iter of Antonine's Itinerary, and in the First of that of Richard of Cirencester. Camden supposes the Name of Caerhun to be a corruption of Caer Hen, i. e. The Old City; but says, that the common Tradition of the Neighbourhood was, that it received its Name from Rhun ap Maelgwn Gwynedd. It is certain that in very ancient writings (as well as in the Returns made to Parliament by the Overseers, in 1 803) it is called Caerhun, whatever may be the Etymology of its name. Bishop Gibson, in his Additions to Camden's Britannia, says, that not many years since there was a Roman Hypocaust discovered at Caerhun ; and that he had seen in the possession of Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart., some curiosities which he had received from thence, particularly a hollow Brick, and a round piece of in scribed Copper, forty pounds weight. The Site of Conovium is nearly a square of 260 feet, surrounded with a slight Vallum of earth, at the distance of some what more than 500 feet from the river Conwy, on the next side to which the ground is very steep from the edge of the Station. Within this ancient Site stands the Church of Caerhun, but no Dwelling-house, the Village being at some distance. At a small distance Northwest from the Church, two ancient Sepulchres were discovered several years ago, walled, and of a square form, and containing human bones. In the hilly ground between the Station and the River, called Erw Gaer, i. e. The Castle Acre, the remains of a considerable Building were discovered several years ago, then supposed to have been an Hypocaust. On the 9th of May, 1799, The Honourable Colonel Greville exhibited to The Society of Antiquaries an ancient Shield, which was found at Caerhun, a short time before, on the East side of the Roman Station, on opening an old Drain about two feet below the surface of the Earth ; and at the same time he exhibited several specimens of ancient Pottery, discovered at the same place, nearly resembling the red Samian ware so frequently met with in Roman Stations, but of a softer substance, and the figures not so well exe cuted. These were supposed to have been manufactured near the spot where they were found, as there remained evident traces of Fire, and a considerable quantity of fine Clay. At the same time the Fragment of a small Patera of the Samian ware was found, with Patrici stamped on the bottom of it. In the K"], [114, "C A E Investigation of these Roman remains, assisted by The Rev. Hugh Davies Griffith, the amiable and hospitable Proprietor of Caerhun, in the latter end of July, 1801, the Welsh labourers, continues Mr. Lysons, undertook the Work with more than usual energy, being fully impressed with the belief that great treasures were buried in Erw Gaer ; and having a Tradition among them, of some extraordinary discoveries which had been formerly made in an adjoin ing Grove. Having examined two Rooms, which had been discovered several years ago, we proceeded to investigate at the South end of them, and by fol lowing the course of the Walls soon ascertained the form of another Room, 20 feet 9 inches, by 14 feet 10 inches, which we cleared out. To the depth of five feet below the surface it was filled with large stones, earth, and rubbish, below which was a stratum of black mould, mixed with burnt wood, in which lay many fragments of coarse earthen Vessels Of various kinds ; but only two, of which enough remained to show their original form; one of them v/as an Amphora; in the same place was also found a coarse Lamp of lead, Bricks of various thicknesses were also found among the rubbish ; and several masses of Wall, formed chiefly of thin brick tiles laid in mortar, also many lumps of clay, and of a Stalactitical incrustation. At the East end of the room, was a sort of Hearth, formed of large thin stones, placed edge-ways in the earth, and large bricks laid flat over them, bearing strong marks of fire. On the North side of the room were two Piers rudely constructed, they were built partly of the hard stone ofthe country and partly of sand stone. In the spaces between them great quantities of fragments of pottery, several lumps of clay, and several pieces of iron were found. There did not appear to be any remains of Pave. ment in this room ; under it was a small drain of stone, covered with slates. Having thoroughly investigated this end of the building, and having every reason to believe that it had not extended any further Southward, we proceeded to explore the opposite end, and soon discovered it to be of a very irregular form. In the first room which we now broke into, there were no remains of Pavement ; fragments of Plaster remained on some parts of the Wall. The area of this room was filled with loose rubbish, mortar, and fragments of brick and tiles, among which we found a rude kind of square Pillar, two feet seven inches and a half in height, of sand stone, exactly similar to those which sup port the floor of the Hypocaust discovered many years ago in Bridge Street, at Chester; and part of a brick funnel, the aperture of which was six inches"], [115, "C A E by four inches and three quarters, and the sides about half an inch thick. The next room was paved with large slates ; in which was a Pier two feet ten inches square, of brick and stone, in alternate layers, and one foot four inches high ; some of the bricks were seventeen inches square and two inches thick, others seventeen inches by twenty-one ; great part of the walls of this room were of brick, and in some places the plaster was remaining, coloured red. At the North-west corner were two steps of stone leading into a further room, which appeared to have been very much worn by use. Under the floor of this room we discovered a drain, varying in width from one foot three inches to one foot nine inches, and from three feet seven inches in depth to four feet six inches, the bottom of it was formed of large slates. In clearing out this apartment we found the fragment of a piece of cornice of sand stone, and a kind of square stone post, two feet nine inches in length, with a round hole near the top, one inch and an half in diameter, and the tenon at the other end by which it had been fixed up. This appeared to have been a kind of Vestibule; it is 23 feet 1 inch in length. In a fourth room were found many stone pillars of the same kind as that already described, standing upright, and supporting parts of the floor, which was of large slates ; others had fallen down. There did not appear any funnels in the Walls, or other marks of a Hypocaust. On the out side of the Buiding, close to the Wall of one of the rooms, we found a stone two feet long and one foot wide, with a channel cut in the middle, as if for the conveyance of water from a spout, and from this were laid a row of seven brick funnels, closely fitted together; they were all of them about ten inches and a half in length, but varied in width ; some were six inches and a half wide, and others only five inches and a half; they had all ofthem round holes on the narrow sides : some of them were scored on the broadest sides. The funnel represented in Gibson's Camden, and supposed to have belonged to a Hypocaust, exactly resembled these. A copper coin of Domitian, and an iron chain of twenty-eight links, somewhat larger than a modern Jack-chain, were afterwards discovered by Mr. Griffith ; together with a small precious stone, perforated, and a part, probably, of a Necklace.\u2014 The Author laments the dis advantage which the Abstract of this interesting Investigation sustains, by want of the Ground Plan, and the delineation of the several Antiquities that were discovered ;\u2014 and which appears, in all probability, to have been a Manufac tory of Roman Pottery.

The Corporation consists of a Mayor, Recorder, Town Clerk, two Sheriffs, six Peers or Justices, Twenty Common Council-men, a Sword-bearer, two Serjeants at Mace, and a Beadle. Here is a Grammar School, endowed by the Right Rev. Dr. Owen, Lord Bishop of St. David's: There should also be an Alms-house, and a Navigation School, but the Endowments are either lost, or otherwise applied. There are two General Sessions for the Town : and three of the Quarterly Sessions for the County, as also the two Great Sessions or Assizes, are holden here. The whole Parish is inclosed, and in high cultivation. It is beautifully situate upon the banks of the navigable River Tywi, and to the Northward of a spacious Bay, to which it gives name, opposite the Bristol Channel. This is the ancient Maridunum, of Antoninus. It is said to have been anciently esteemed the capital of all Wales. Here the Princes of Wales fixed their Chancery and Exchequer, for the South part of the Principality ; and so continued, until the Jurisdiction of the Court and Marches of Wales were abolished. It gives Title of Marquis to the Noble Family of Osborne. Little is known of the Castle; and what now remains of it, is converted into the County Gaol. The present worthy Vicar, The Rev. W. H. Barker, in the most obliging and satisfactory manner, adds,"], [117, "C A E \" St. Peter's is the Name of the Parish, which is frequently called Caermarthen, from the Town in which it is situne.

There are Ruins of a large Priory in the Eastern part of the Town ; and, at the West end, are some Walls of a Friary. Close to the North ofthe Town are the remains of an old Roman Pretorium, in a Field, called The Bull rack (Bulwark), where was the Gaer, or Roman Camp.

The Resident Population of this Town, in 1801, and the Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1303, are included in the Re turns made from Llan Beblie:. It is 25 li m. N. W. b. W. from London. The Markets are on Wednesday, and Saturday. The Fairs are holden on the 12th of March, 16th of May, 12th of August, 20th of September, and 5th of De cember. This Town sends one Member to Parliament, in conjunction with the Burgesses of Conwy, Cricaeth, Nefyn, and Pwllheli ; the Bailiffs are the"], [118, "C A E Returning Officers. The Constable of the Castle is always Mayor (The Earl of Uxbridge), by virtue of his Patent; and subordinate to him, the Borough is governed by two Bailiffs, an Alderman, a Town Clerk, two Serjeants at Mace, and other Officers. The Road from the Town of Caernarvon to the Parish Church at Llan Beblig intersects the Walls of Old Segontium, or Caer Seiont, of which there are considerable remains ; as there are also of an old Roman Fort or Castle (on the very edge of the steep bank of the river Seiont, between old Segontium and Caernarvon), the walls of which are still from 16 to 20 feet high. On the North-west side of the Town, adjoining one of the Towers of the Wall which surrounded it, is the small Chapel consisting of a Nave and two side Aisles ; this is generally supposed to have been the Garrison Chapel; but there appears to have been a more ancient one than this, a part of which is still standing, and forms nearly one half of a Publick-house at the North end, and the corner House but one on the West side of Castle Street. There were several English Gentlemen introduced into this Town, as Governors and Offi- cers ofthe Castle, by the Kings of England after the Conquest, a few of whose Posterity still remain; ofthis number no doubt were the Spicers, Pilstones, Bowmans, and Bolds ; and the old Houses, where they lived, still go by their respective names ; such as Plds Pilstwn, the present King's Head Inn : Plds Bowman, on the corner of Church Street ; and Plds Spicer, in Church Street. The Town of Caernarvon is increasing in size and opulence ; several new Houses are built there every year, and The Sportsman's Arms Inn, and The New Hotel, afford every accommodation of Elegance and Convenience. The Cor- poration are now building (in 1808) an elegant Town Hall and Market House in the centre of the Town. Many Thousand Tons of the best Slates in the World (which are of a blue kind, very light and convenient for carriage, and the most durable of any yet discovered) are annually shipped off from hence for Liverpool, Dublin, Cork, and other parts of the United Kingdom, and also to America. The Custom-house here is subject to the Comptroller of Beaumaris. The Menai is about a mile and a half across here, over which there is a Ferry to Tal y Foel, in the Isle of Anglesea. This is said to have been anciently the Seat of the British Princes ; and when Edward the First was re- pairing the Town, it was reported that the body of the Emperor Constantius, Father of Constantine the Great, being discovered here, he ordered it to be ho- nourably interred in the New Church. This Monarch is also said to have con verted the profits ofthe Archbishoprick of York, then vacant, to the building and"], [119, "CA E fortifying the Castle ; a great part whereof now remains, and in the Eagle Tower of which, was born, in the year 1284, Edward of Caernarvon, the First Prince of Wales of English blood, and afterwards King, by the Title of Edward the Second. This Castle was besieged by the Parliamentary Forces, in the great Rebellion, and obliged to surrender to them in the beginning of June, I646. It now gives the Title of Earl to the Family of Herbert. According to Mr. Norris, the Bar of Caernarvon is so far from the Shore, that in foggy weather Land-marks are of little use ; and, as it is also a shifting Bar, it may well be said, they are of no use at all. Two buoys have of late been set down, one black and the other red, which were much wanted, and great care ought to be taken to preserve them. Vessels going in must leave the black Buoy on the Larboard hand, the red Buoy on the Starboard hand, and the Perch on the Larboard hand. Vessels drawing more than 10 feet water, must not attempt to pass the Bar until four Hours flood ; the Breakers about the black Buoy are occasioned by the meeting of the Tides, and not on account of any Shallows. Many Vessels take the Menai passage, particularly when the Wind is adverse for doubling Holyhead, but it must not be attempted by strangers without a Pilot, on ac count of the danger of going through the Swelly, which cannot be passed but on slack tides. Near Moely Don, there is a large bed of a beautiful small grained white free stone, which supplies this part of the Country with Whet stones : the hardest kind, if used with oil, is little inferior to the Turkey Oil stone. The Assizes for the County, and the Petty Sessions for the District of Arson, are holden here.

The Castle, which is in ruins, is remarkable for its Hanging Tower, which projects eleven feet from its base. The extent of the Hundred of Caerphilly is about Thirty Miles : and is stated to produce more Revenue to Government than any other Hundred in the County of Glamorgan, in consequence of the Iron and other Works carried on within it. The District of Seinghenydd or Caerphilly takes its name from Cenydd, a Saint"], [120, "C A E who lived about the middle of the Sixth Century. The Woollen Manufacture is established here.

It is governed by two Bailiffs, who are appointed at the Court Leet of the Lord of the Manor (The Earl of Plymouth) : and is one of the Contributary Boroughs with Flint, in returning one Member to Parliament, but has not the honour ofbeing incorporated. The Assizes were many years ago holden here, but have since been removed to Mold : there are still the re main of an old Gaol which was formerly in use.

This Town had the honour of being the place of the Eisteddfod, or the Sessions ofthe Bards and Minstrels for many Centuries : and it was chosen for this purpose, in compliance with the ancient custom of the Welsh, because it had been the Princely residence of Llywelyn ab Grufydd.

According to Mr. Morris, here is a convenient place to make a small Dock, Nature having laid out the lines of one ready to our hands ; or a small Pier might be made, which would make it a safe lying place for Coasters ; a Perch ought to be erected on the Eastern end of Harry's Furlong, a very dangerous spot of foul ground. Here and at the Coal Rock numbers of Vessels have been lost, the Rock being exactly in the trade way, and some care ought to be taken of men's lives more than has been hitherto. On this dangerous Coast, and near to this Place, is a famous Quarry of the stone Asbestos, a beautiful marble, in which is found the Linum Abeslinum, called here Salamander's Wool; of a substance like Flax, that will bear common fire ; it is mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, and others, who say the Ancients made cloth of this Fossil Flax, in which they burnt the hearts of their deceased Princes, to preserve their ashes. And at Llan Badrig, three miles Eastward of this place, there is a great body or vein of strong ochre of various colours, and an extraordinary fine white clay, of the Cimolia kind.

This Town, in con junction with the Boroughs of Aber Ystwith, Atpar, and Llan Bedr, send one Member to Parliament ; the Mayor is the Returning Officer. The Assizes, and Petty Sessions, are holden here. It is situate near the entrance of the river Teifi, upon St. George's Channel. This is the County Town, and, according to Mr. Meyrick, is a large ancient built Place: the principal Street is very broad, but the others are narrow. At one end of the broad Street is the Gaol or Penilentiafy-House, erected at the expense ofthe County, in the year 1793, by Mr. Nash the Architect : It is a very handsome Building, and on a good Plan : It has a Chapel, which is^kept remarkably clean : The Central, or Inspec tion Room, is the Residence of the Gaoler. One great disadvantage, however, is the want of a ready supply of Water, none being to be had but what is fetched by the Keepers from a Well at the distance of a quarter of a Mile. Before this new Edifice was built, what has since been converted into a Poor house, was used for that purpose: that Building was erected in 1773. The Town-Hall, where the Assizes are holden, is a handsome structure, and was built in the year 17 64. Here is also a Free Grammar School; which was endowed, sometime between the years 1760 and 1770, by Lady L\u00e6titia Corn wallis, of Aber Maries, in the County of Caermarthen, with \u00a321. .10. .6 per an num.

At Spring Tides, Cardigan Bar has 22 feet of water upon it. The King's Wear of Cil Gerran, lies up the Teifi. The Bridge, which consists of seven arches, is very ancient. This River is remarkable for the number of those curious Vessels upon it, called Coracles. Cardigan gives the Title of Earl to the Noble Family of Brudenel. Ofthe Castle of Cardigan, once a very strong Edifice, all that now remains of it are two Towers and the Wall: It is situate close to the edge of the river Teifi, and near the Bridge. The Castle, and the Ground contained within its outer Walls, called The Castle Green, now belong (in 18 10) to John Bowen, Esq., who has erected a House on the Site ofthe Keep, the Dungeons now serving as his Cel lars: the Wall between the two Towers being lowered, and the Green sloped down so as to form a hanging Garden. The Foundation of this Castle is ascribed to Gilbert de Clare, about the year 1160: It was invested, in 1166, by Rhys ap Grufydd, taken, and kept possession of until his death, in 1197 : In"], [127, "GAR 1176, this Rhys made a great Feast at Christmas in his Castle of Cardigan, on completing that Fortress ; which he caused to be proclaimed a year and a day before-hand, and sent invitation to all the Bards in Wales, England, Ireland, and Scotland, to repair thither: many strangers resorted accordingly to his Castle, who were honourably received and worthily entertained: Besides Deeds of Arms, and other Exhibitions, the Bards were placed on Chairs in the great Hall of the Castle, and ordered to exercise their several Talents, and great Rewards were promised to the Victors : In this contest, the Bards of North Wales won the Prize of Poetry, and among the Musicians, those of Rhys's own Household were adjudged to have excelled in the powers of Harmony, and in particular the Son of Estyn, the Crythor. His Son Grufydd succeeded him in this County, but was dispossessed by Maelgon his Brother, who also took the Castle, in 1198, and fortified it; but with equal treachery, soon sold it to the English: In 1215, it was taken by Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, at the close of a very victorious Campaign (in alliance with the Barons against King John), and was allotted to Owain ap Rhys : In 1218, Llywelyn, upon the second summons issued against him, having appeared before Henry the Third at Gloucester, to do homage, promised to restore this Castle to him, but he afterwards declined to confirm his promise, and placed a new Garrison in it: In the following year it was taken by the Flemings by force ; upon which, Llywelyn marched against them, regained possession of it, and razed it to the ground, putting the Garrison to the Sword : In 1223, the Earl of Pembroke recovered it, and had ample revenge on the Welsh Garrison, for the cruel treatment which his Soldiers had lately experienced from Llywelyn : In 1228, Walter de Clifford was constituted Governor: In 1231, Maelgon ap Maelgon ap Rhys laid siege to it, took the Town, destroyed it to the Castle Gates, and slew all the Inhabitants; and shortly after returning with his Cousin, Owain ap Grufydd ap Rhys, broke down the Bridge, laid siege to the Castle, and with engines demolished it: By whom it was rebuilt History is silent; but, on the Conquest of Wales, it was honoured by the Residence of Edward the First, for one Month, whilst settling the affairs of South Wales: it was taken by Charles Gerrard during the Rebellion, in the reign of Charles the First. There is a small, but strong, Camp below Cardigan, on the banks of the Teifi, called Hen Gastell.

The Name implies, The Mountain Ash, with which the District, pro bably, in former times abounded. It is the opinion of some Etymologists, that the word Ceri is a corruption of Caerau, i. e. Fortified Places, the remains of which are numerous in the Parish. The ancient Name ofthe Church was Llanfihangel yn Gheri, or, The Church dedicated to St. Michael and the Angels in Ceri. The Wake is kept on the Sunday succeeding Michaelmas day. The Chapel of Gwern Ygo, which was formerly supported by the Tythes of that Township, is now in ruins: the Township being at present Tythe-free, and paying a Modus of 4d. to the Vicar of Ceri. The Parish of Ceri must have formed part of the property, which was given by Elystan Glodrydd, Lord of Ferregs and Maelienydd, to his second son Morgeneu. Llywelyn ab Jorwerth N2"], [136, "C E R gave the' Lordships of Ceri and Cydewain, as a marriage portion, with his daughter Gwladus the widow of Reginald de Breos, Lord of Brecknock, to Reginald Mortimer, Lord of Maelienydd: who, about the year 1242, built the castles of Cefn Llys and Cnwclas. According to Matthew Paris, Ceri was the Scene of the successful resistance of Llywelyn ab Jorwerth to King Henry the Third. The English Monarch, after his irruption into the Borders, led his army into the Vale of Ceri, to a place corruptly called Cridia, having in his march compelled the Welsh to raise the siege of Montgomery ; At Ceri much time was lost in cutting down a Wood of vast extent, which frequently pro tected the Welsh from the incursions of the English ; in the centre whereof was a castellated Mansion, serving the Inhabitants as a place of security against the sudden attack of the English : This Mansion King Henry took and demol ished; but finding the Site of it very strong, and almost inaccessible, he, by the advice of Hubert de Buro-h, laid the foundation of a Castle on the same spot. But Llywelyn so harassed the English, during its erection, by intercept ing their Convoys, and cutting off their foraging parties, that Henry, after three months labour and much expense, was glad to agree to a truce ; the con ditions of which, on his part, were the'levelling the works which he had con structed, called Hubert's Folly; and, on the part of the Welsh Prince, to pay 3000 marks for the materials, and consenting to do homage for the Lordship of Ceri: William de Breos, Lord of Brecknock, was taken prisoner at Ceri in one of their rencounters, for whose liberation Henry made no stipulation. Ceri belongs to the See of St. David's ; which is probably owing to the activity and courage of Giraldus Cambrensis ; as also the adjoining Parish of Mochtref, and probably likewise a great part of the County of Radnor. Giraldus, at that time Archdeacon of Brecknock, having heard that the Bishop of St. Asaph had claimed, and had called upon the inhabitants of Powys and Cydewain to assist him in taking possession of the Church of Ceri by force, if necessary: he (Giraldus) summoned the Clergy of the County of Radnor to meet him at Ceri, and prevailed also upon Einion Glyd, and Cadwallon, two Reguli of that County, to furnish him with a body of horse, and support him in defending the rights of the See of St. David's. Thus assisted he arrived at Ceri before the Bishop, tolled the Bells, and said Mass : On the Bishop's approach, he prohi bited his entrance to the Church, unless he came as a friend : On the Bishop's persisting to take possession, Giraldus, accompanied by the rest of the Clergy, met him in procession with Tapers ; and carrying the Cross, threatened him"], [137, "C E R with Excommunication, upon which he departed much mortified. There are several traces of intrench ments, and fortified places, still remaining in the Parish of Ceri, which prove it to have been a scene of Warfare in former ages, and are strong evidences of the truth of the preceding History. But the total change of language from that of Welsh to English, within the last Century, prevents any advantage to be derived from Tradition, respecting the History and Antiquities of the Parish.

Small Craft come up this Rivulet, at Spring Tides, with Coals from Lloughor and Llan Elly, for the supply of the Country : there being no Coals found fur ther to the Southward than near the Village of Llan Rhidian, where the Lime stone then appears, and continues along the South Coast of Gower to the Mumble Point. The Craft convey Limestone from Cheriton to Lloughor, and the adjacent Country. Limestone is also dug up and shipped off to the County of Devon, in every little Bay or Creek along the Coast, where a Vessel can with any safety moor herself, so as to take it in.

Near the Chapel are the Ruins of an old Castle, with a number of Houses, commonly called Oldcaslle Bridgend.

The Fairs are holden on the 1st of January, 12th of May, and 31st of August. It takes its Name from an old British Fortress, called Crug Hywel, i. e., How el' s Mount, which is seated on a projecting Knoll of the Breannog Mountain. It is a Borough by Prescription. The situation has been much admired for its picturesque beauty. Sir Richard Hoare remarks, that from no spot does the Vale of Usk appear to greater advantage than from Crickhowel. It is much frequented by the lovers of Angling in the fishing season, which, in mild Springs, com- mences about the end of February, and continues to the middle of June. The Manor was granted by Bernard de Newmarch, in the reign of King Wil- liam Rufus, to Sir Humphrey Burghill (who had been one of his Knights As- sociates in the reduction of the Welsh), to be holden in Knight's service, as of the Lordship of Blaen Llyfni. It has since passed through the Families of Turbeville, Pauncefote, and Herbert, into that of Somerset, of which The Duke of Beaufort is the present Representative. Thie Lord of the Manor annually appoints a Bailiff of the Borough, and there were anciently two Burgesses; the latter, however, have been long since discontinued, and the former, not having been confirmed by Royal Charter, is now little more than a Collector of the Bur- gage Rents. All Public business for the Hundred is transacted by the County Magistrates, who hold the Petty Sessions monthly in the Town. The small remains of the Castle, with its high Mount, are still visible from the road. By whom this Fortress was erected is uncertain : but it was last fortified by Sir John Pauncefote, under a Royal Commission from King Henry the Fourth, to resist the incursions of Owain Glandwr: it, probably, fell a sacrifice to the fury of that bold Chieftain, after he had demolished the Castle of Abergavenny : it was certainly a ruin in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as certified in the an- cient Survey of the Manor : It has sometimes been called Allsby's Castle, con- cerning which the following conjecture is offered in explanation ; it will be recollected, that Roger Mortimer, the Lord of Wigmore, who was also the Lord Marcher of Blaen Llyfni (to which Crickhowel was subordinate, in the reign of Edward the Second), was committed as a Prisoner to the Tower of Q,"], [158, "C R U London, for Treason and Rebellion, from whence he made his escape by the contrivance and assistance of one Gerard de Allspeye, who was one of his Keepers : Now, is it not probable, that upon his return to power and the possession of his estates, under the prevalence of the Queen's party, he might have rewarded his friend Allspeye, with, the government of this his Castle, which, during that period, and, perhaps, for some years after, might have retained his Name? the cor ruption of Allspeye into Alisby, may easily be admitted. Gerard de Allspeye obtained a special pardon for his offence, in the fourth year of the reign of Edward the Third. At the West end of the Town is an old embattled Gate way, now called Porlh-Mawr ; it was the entrance to a castellated Mansion, called Cwrty Carw, i. e., The Stag's Court, belonging to a branch of the Her bert Family, which settled in this Parish, about the reign of Edward the Fourth : the present proprietor has lately erected a Mansion upon the Pre mises. The Church is distinguished by having the only Spire in the County of Brecknock. The Tythes of this Parish are divided into four unequal Por tions : the first, a Lay Impropriation (valued in the King's Books at\u00a34..14\u201e7) is vested in The Duke of Beaufort : the second, a Rectorial Sine Cure, is valued in the King's Books at \u00a35-9-9|-: the third, a Vicarial Endowment, the yearly value of which, according to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, arising from Aug mentation, Composition for Tythes, Glebe, and Surplice fees, was \u00a379. .0.. 6\\: and the fourth, an Allotment ofthe annual value of \u00a312. to the Sexton, being the clear Tythes of some Fields near the Town, without Partition with the Impropriator, Rector, or Vicar, and also one shilling a year charged upon part of Wernvale (Tir Gronw Foel). In the Chancel of the Church are two old Monuments of the Pauncefote Family, and a more modern one in Alabaster of Sir John Herbert, Knt. It had anciently a Chapel of Ease, called Llan Fair, or, St. Marys Church, about a mile distant, on the Brecknock road: the Name still remains, but the last ruins of the Building have, within these few years, been removed to make room for a Barn. Giraldus Cambrensis tells us, that he was cited to appear in this Chapel before the Priors of Llanthoni and Breck nock, to answer to charges brought against him by the Archbishop of Canter bury, in the reign of King Henry the Second. Here is a Bridge (lately re paired, after a high flood which carried away three of the Arches) over the river Usk. \u2014 The Hundred of Crickhowel contains eight Parishes, namely, Crug Hywel, Llan Gattwg, Llan Genau, Llan Elly, Llan Bedr, and Partrishow within the Manor of Crickhowel ; and Llan Gynidr, and Llanfihangel Cwm"], [159, "C W M du, in the Manor osTre'r Twr. Under its native Princes, and even during the government of the Lords Marchers, this district was included in the Lord ship of Ystrad Wy, which comprehended also a portion of the present Hun dred of Talgarth. For, as Leland tells us, \" Tretour and Creghouel stand in Estrodewe Hundrede.\" And, previous to the reign of King Henry the First, it formed a part of the Diocese of Llandaf. It was then, without any plea of right, seized by Bernard, Bishop of St. David's, who attached it to his own See : And, notwithstanding a Papal Bull, which positively commanded its re stitution, he had sufficient interest with the English Court, to retain possession, and transmit it to his successors. Upon the Division of the County into Hun dreds, by the Statute of 27\u00b0 Henry VIII. cap. 26. sect. 26., Crickhowel, from its central situation, was made the Capital of the Hundred. The Duke of Beaufort, as Lord Paramount, has his Courts Leet and Courts Baron, with the cognizance of small offences, debts, and actions under 40s. ; and the appoint ment of his own special Coroner for the Hundred : And in which there are no Copyhold tenures, the Lands being either Freehold or holden by Leases under His Grace : but as the old Lives are dropping off, they are not now re newed, and Leases of twenty-one years are substituted.

On Moel Hiraddug, a Hill of a conical form, are the remains of a British fort ress ; and which is also remarkable for having on its summit, a bed of bright and beautiful, but brittle, red Spar ; and from whence is a most extensive and sublime prospect. At Marian, a quantity of Iron Stone has been discovered.

It is situate in a peculiarly romantic valley, being placed amidst elevated Hills, and broken Precipices, and was once environed with Forests of Oak, which are now nearly demolished.

This Parish is of an oval form, being about ten miles by five in extent ; of which, about one tenth part is cultivated. The name signifies, The Dingle of two Waters or Rivers, which are the Wye and the Elan. There is also another ingenious Etymology of the Name of this Parish, Cymmer Dau Ddwr, that is, The Junction or Confluence of tno Rivers, the Elan falling into the Wye at the South extremity of the Parish. Great numbers of Sheep and horned Cattle depasture on these Hills ; which are sent from hence, and other parts of the Principality, yearly to England to supply the Fairs and Markets, and even that of Smithfield itself. Here are Grouse. The Turf raised on the Hills is little inferior to Coal, and mostly supplies the Neighbourhood with firing. A Lead Mine is worked on the Estate of Thomas Grove, of Cwm Elan, Esq., Lord of the Manor of The Grange. The Church, a neat Structure, was rebuilt in"], [163, "C Y D 17 78 ; the Stone-wall is of excellent Masonry. At Nant Wyllt, 4 m. S W. b.

At Nant Madoc, between the Church and Chapel of Nant Wyllt, the ruins of Gipel Madoc are to be seen, near to which there was a Monastery: an adjoining Farm, called Coed y Mynach, i. e., The Monks' Wood, supplied the Monastery with Wood for culinary and other pur poses. The Road may be traced from bence over the Mountains to the Abbey of Strata Florida, in the County of Cardigan, whither the Monks, on certain occasions, went in procession. The Tythes are divided between the Prebend ary and the Vicar ; but, in the Township of The Grange, the Vicar has only the one Third part. In 1719, The Rev.

The Resident Population of this Town, in 1 80 1, was 249- The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a379-9-2, at 8s, in the pound. It is 14 m. N. W. from Cowbridge. It is one of the Contributary Boroughs, with Caer diff, which send one Member to Parliament. The Corporation consists of a Constable ofthe Castle, a Portrieve, Aldermen, and a Recorder. The Portrieve, and Recorder, are chosen annually from the 56 In-dwelling Burgessses: there are at present also 76 Out dwelling Burgesses belonging to this Borough, mak ing in all 123 Burgesses. A Town Hall was lately erected here, which cost about \u00a3400. The Borough is a Lordship of itself, belonging to Thomas Mansell Talbot, Esq., with a Super Lordship over North Cornelly, South Cor nelly, and Scarfeur. There were formerly two Fairs holden annually in this Bor ough ; the first, commencing on Whitsun Tuesday, and continuing for eight days successively ; the second, commencing on the Evening of St. James the Apostle, and continued also for eight days. The Name appears to be derived from Cefn, a Rising Ground, and Figen, a Bog ; which Bog has been, for time imme morial, a Lake, about two miles in circumference, and which abounds with Pike of a large size. \u2014 The present worthy Vicar, The Rev. John Morgan, most obligingly adds, \" The Corporation of Kenfigg comprehends about one third of the inclosed Lands, lying in the Parish of Pyle and Kenfigg. The Corporation district extends into the Parish of Margam, and includes a Hamlet, called"], [167, "C Y N Higher Kenfigg, though this Hamlet is rated in every particular to the Parish of Margam. Kenfigg contains about 750 acres of inclosed Land, nearly of the same quality and value, and 800 acres of Warren and Sand Banks. Tradition informs us, that the old Town, Castle, and Church, were inundated by a great Storm, leaving the Buildings overwhelmed by the Sands, and evident marks of this calamitous event areTvisible, and prove the circumstance beyond contradic- tion. Previous to this, Kenfigg was a place of great note and consideration, the High Road then passing through it, which was afterwards diverted through Pyle. The remains of the Castle appear about 15 feet above the top ofthe Sand at this time, with the vestiges of a Moat at the distance of 100 yards from it, and surrounding it, except on the River side, which runs at present about 20 yards to the North of it, and thence empties itself into the Bristol Channel. About 300 yards from the Castle, to the South, are the remains of the ancient Church and Burying Place, as a great quantity of Human bones are often dis- cernible by the drifting of the Sand. This Storm, which has given a new and desolated aspect to a great District of Country, happened during the last year of the Reign of Edward the Sixth, or, immediately on the Accession of Queen Mary; in the first year of whose reign, anno 1554, \"An Act touching the Sea Sands in Glamorganshire\" was passed ; wherein an Act of the 23\u00b0 of Hen. VIII. is recited, which provides for Commissions of Sewers, and that the said act does not extend to reform the damage done by reason of Sand arising out ofthe Sea and driven to Land by Storms and Winds, whereby much good ground, lying on the Sea Coasts in sundry places of this Realm and especially in the County of Glamorgan, is covered with such Sand to the great loss of the Queen's subjects, and more is like to ensue if speedy remedy be not provided. And enacts, that the said Act of Sewers and Commissions shall give full power to the redress and securing ofthe said grounds from hurt and destruc- tion by reason ofthe said Sands. Empowered by this Act, a Commission was holden, as appears by a Paper now extant in Mr. Talbot's possession, tore-ascer- tain the Boundaries between Cynfig and Skeir, which had been so overwhelmed with Sand as to leave no trace of the ancient limits. Skeir is a large Extra- Parochial Farm, adjoining the South-east side of the Parish of Cynfig, formerly appertaining to the Abbey of Neath, but now by purchase the property of Mr. Talbot. Since this inundating devastation, the Arundo Arenaria has been planted in these Sand Banks, in order to bind and fix them, as it does on the R2"], [168, "C Y N Coast of Holland ; and every Tenant who rents in the Moor adjoining, cove nants in his Lease to give yearly the labour of a day or more in proportion to his Land for the planting of this Rush, and experience has proved its good effects. These Sand-Banks are all Rabbit Warrens ; and afford a fine ride, dur ing low water, of about twelve miles, from Skeir Rocks to Briton Ferry. We are informed by History, that this Castle was inhabited by Jestyn ab Gwrgant for some time : it was afterwards, by right of Conquest, seized by Robert Fitz hamon, and from him it descended to his heiress, Mabel, the wife of Robert Earl of Gloucester, who endowed the Abbey of Margam with large possessions. We cannot find the date of our first Charter. The first Confirmation of the original Grant was made by Thomas le Despencer, Lord of Glamorgan, Sec, and was afterwards further confirmed by his Son, Edward le Despencer, and his Daughter Isabel ; the first is dated on the 14th of May, I36O, the second, on the 16th of February, 1396, and the third on the 1st of May, 1423. Henry, who was promoted to the See of Llandaff in the year 1 199, and who died in the year 1218, gave his Confirmation and Grant ofthe Church of Kenfigg with its Ap purtenances, to the Abbey of Margam, on the Petition of Walter, Abbot of Te wkesbury : but how the Presentation was alienated from the Margam Property, and devolved to the Crown, we are unable to trace, the Archives ofthe Church of Llandaff having some years since been destroyed by Fire. The areat Tythes belong to Thomas Mansell Talbot, Esq. ; and the small Tythes to the Vicar.\" \u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Tythes, and Augmentation, was \u00a367.

The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a3236..5\u201e11, at 17.*. 6d. in the pound. It is 7 m. N.W. from Caermarthen. A Fair is holden here for Cattle, Sheep, and Horses, on St. Martin's Eve an nually. Here is a Free School, endowed by Mrs. Anna Warner, with \u00a310. per annum, for the Education ofthe Children of poor Parishioners. This Benefice (incapable of Queen Anne's Augmentation, by reason ofitsannexure) enjoys only the original endowment of Two Pounds per annum, and Mrs. Anna Warner's Legacy of Eight Pounds ! \u2014 This Parish is about four miles and a half in length, and three miles and a quarter in breadth ; and about one seventeenth part of it is uninclosed, which affords excellent Herbage for young Cattle and Sheep. \u2014 The Rev. D. Lewis, the present most worthy and intelligent Vicar, very obligingly adds, \" It is now improving very rapidly, owing to the excellent Turnpike Road lately made through it ; and the ground in the Village sold, in 1807, in small portions, being built upon by the new purchasers. Land, ad joining the Village, is let at about \u00a35. per Statute acre, which, ten years ago, was reckoned high at 15*. The vestiges of an old Chapel are still discernible on the Farm of Troed y Rhiw, in the Northern part of the Parish ; the Wall of the Church-yard is easily traced; the adjacent Field is called Cae'r Hen Eglwys. It is supposed to have been ruinated in the reign of Henry VIII., or, perhaps, sooner. The Country here is full of deep dingles and dorsal Hills, all of which converge in a point at Convil. The chalybeate Spring of Ffosana is reported to have done wonders: Its virtues are very efficacious at this time, but the Natives prefer resorting to more fashionable, though less sanative Waters: its constituent parts have been analyzed, and will soon be published. \u2014 An un noticed, but very remarkable, remain of Antiquity is to be seen in the North West extremity of this Parish, viz., a Druidical Temple 01 Observatory (I sup pose). On the side-land Summit of a High Mountain, facing the South, is a"], [170, "C Y N centre Stone of a huge Magnitude, from 10 to 1 5 Tons, horizontal, oblong, two feet thick, supported by four Uprights, one of which has declined from its original Position, and sunk deeper into the ground. Four other similar, but smaller stones, of about four or five Tons, surround it : but these have all slipt from their respective fulcra, and lie now in a shelving Position. Scattered about, at various and irregular distances around, are several smaller stones, disturbed and broken up by the Masons building the House of Nanty Clawdd ucha. The surface of the Sea, at high water, can just be seen from it. The range of stone, which I take to be its original Meridian, is declined about two Degrees to the East. A Crug or tumulus of large circumference adjoins the Temple. The Centre Stone does not shake. A wide flat, now a Turbary, sur rounds it. The large Stones are not the Stones of the Country. They are hard, rough, flaky, brown, large grained, and seemingly weather-worn. \u2014 In the same part of the Parish is The lAne, a Mile and a quarter long, and about 1 7 feet high, which is said to have been thrown up by Henry Earl of Richmond on his way from Milford Haven, to meet King Richard the Third. CYNWYL CAEO, in the Cwmwd of Caeo, Cantref Bychan (now called the Hundred of Caeo), Co. of Caermarthen, South Wales: a V., with the Chapel of Llan Sawyl annexed, and valued in the King's Books at \u00a35. : Patron, The King; but it is usually conferred by the Lord Chancellor: Church ded. to St. Cynwyl. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 180 1, was 1668. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was, viz., For the Hamlet of Cwm Coethi - \u00a3 75.. 10. .8 1 For the Hamlet of Cwm Twrch - - 119..16..0-M For the Hamlet of Maes Troyddin - - 76.. 4..5f in the pound. For y Faenor Isaf, or, the Lower Hamlet l'29..19..4*ij \u00a3401. 10.. 7. It is 7 m. W. N. W. from Llandovery. The Fairs are holden on the 21st of August, and the 6th of October. This Parish contains about 6000 acres of Land. Some vestiges ofthe Chapel at Pump-Saint, which was of considerable Magni tude, remained within the memory of man : and in the North East extremity of the Parish was anciently another Chapel, at Courts Cadno, i. e. Fox Hall, but all traces of it are now obliterated. It is beautifully situate near the rivers Coethi, and Twrch. In the Heroic Elegies of Llyyvarch Hen, a celebrated Poet who flourished from about the year 520 to 630, Caeo is called Caer Gaeo, which seems to imply that it was then considered as a City, or, at least, as a well for-"], [171, "C Y N tified place: and from the Magnitude ofthe Church, it is conjectured, that some Monastic or Ecclesiastical Institution was established here in the middle Centu- ries. At the Mines within this Parish, and which were, doubtless, worked by the Romans, is a Well of remarkably cold water, issuing from a Rock, and con- sidered formerly as infallibly efficacious in Rheumatic complaints. Near Briw Nant, the Seat of The Rev. Mr. Lloyd, and on the Estate of J. Johnes, Esq., of Dol Coethi, are two sulphureous Springs, which are supposed to be superior to the YVells in the Counties of Brecknock and Radnor; but they are scarcely known, and remain in a very neglected state: Mr. Rasp, the Miner- alogist, from an experiment made upon one of them, found that the water was impregnated with a greater quantity of sulphur than any Spring that he had visited. Near Pump-Saint, is a Chalybeate spring of great celebrity in the neighbourhood, for the many extraordinary cures which it is reported to have effected. At Maes Llan Wrthwl, in this Parish, a great Battle was fought between the Romans and ancient Britons ; and a Roman General was interred there. Under the Threshold of the Door, at the Seat of J. Bowen, Esq., are the neglected fragments of a stone,with an Inscription which is givenat length in Cam- den. There are several Tumuli in the neighbourhood ; particularly, near a Bridge called Pont Rhyd Remus, i. e. The Bridge on Remus' s Ford. Roman Bricks are often dug up in the adjacent Fields. Tradition says, that a large Town, called y Dref Gochyn Neheubarth, i. e. The Red Town in South Wales, was built here by the Roman Soldiery, and that the Houses were principally constructed of Brick. Near the summit of a Hill, where at present there is no water, are the ruins of a Mill, called Melin Milwyr, i. e. The Soldier s Mill. The traces of an Aque- duct are observed near the spot. The River was raised with immense labour, and brought over the highest Hills for many miles, and poured over the exca- vated Mountain, where they dug for ore, in order to wash away the dross in the manner described by Pliny. It is hardly credible, that a Stream of the magni- tude of the Coethi could be thus raised, and carried so prodigious a distance over steep precipices; but the vestiges of the Work are still visible, and excite every intelligent person's admiration. Considerable quantities of gold are supposed to have been gotten, of old time, in these Mines. A beautiful golden Torques, now in the possession of J. Johnes, Esq., was ploughed up by his servants in the common Field: the extremity of which was adorned with a curious figure of a Serpent, of the same pure metal. Another Torques, adorned with the figure of a Dolphin of the same material, was dug up not long ago, near the same spot ;"], [172, "DAR and Roman ornaments, though never searched for, are frequently dicovered in the vicinity of these ancient Mines. In digging for gravel to repair the roads, a common coarse pebble was lately found here, with an Amethyst in the middle of its upper surface; which, on examination, proved to be a very valuable antique, of Diana: it is now in the possession of J. Johnes, Esq. On the road to Llan Ddewi Brefi, at a place called Hen Llan, in this Parish, there is a Roman Causeway, called by the Inhabitants Sam Helen : the usual appellation in the Principality for Roman Roads, in honour of Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine the Great, whom they represent as a Native of Wales. According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Tythes, Glebe, and Surplice fees, was \u00a363.. 15-4.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 314. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803,'was \u00a3175-17-7, at 3s. .gd in the pound. It is 14 m. S. W. from Haverford West. There are two Light houses upon St. Anne's Point, at the entrance of Milford Haven, which were erected in the reign of Queen Anne, by Mr. Allen, and which were renewed on the most improved Plan, about ten years ago, by the same Family. Mr. Morris observes, that Dale Road and Harbour is a ready outlet, where vessels may ride in two or three fathoms at low water. The Pier, which is now in a bad state, should not be suffered to go to decay, and it would be very useful to trade, if it was repaired. The Impropriation is vested in John Lloyd, Esq., of Dale Castle. According to the Diocesan Report, in I809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Augmentation, and Surplice Fees, was \u00a359-18. .0. DAR OWAIN, i. e.

The Resident"], [173, "D A V Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting of the Townships of Caer Seddfan, and Noddfa) was 801. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a3340-3-2, at 12s. 3d. in the pound. It is 6 m. E. N. E. from Ma chynllaeth. This Parish contains about 4000 acres of inclosed and cultivated Land; and about 5000 acres uninclosed and uncultivated. The Wake or Feast of Dedication to Saint Tudyr, the Patron Saint, is annually observed on the 25th day of October, or the first Sunday after. The diversion is kept on Monday, by what is called Curo Tudyr, or, The beating of Tudyr; which is done in this manner, one of the Lads carrying a long Pole, or Branch of a Tree, upon his shoulder, the other Lads beat it with their clubs. About the distance of half a mile West ofthe Parish Church, on the top of a Hill, called Fron Goch (in the Township of Caer Seddfan) are the remains of an ancient Camp. And on the top of another Hill opposite to it, on the North side, being part of a Farm, called Berllan-Deg, several warlike Instruments of brass were discovered some years ago. The Rectory of Dar Owain, a Sine Cure, is valued in the King's Books at \u00a3l0..17..11 : Patron, The Bishop of St. Asaph. DAVID\\S, ST., v. BRECKNOCK.

The Resident Population of this City and Parish, in 1801, (consist ing of the four Cylchs or Divisions, called Cylch Bychan, Cylch Gwaelod y Wlad, Cylch Mawr, and Cylch y Tref) was I8O3. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1S03, was \u00a3607-13.. 11. It is 16 m. N. W. from Haver ford West, and 284 m. W. b.N. from London. St. David's is not a Market Town ; but Mutton, Veal, and Lamb are offered to sale, in their respective seasons, by Butchers of the City and Neighbourhood generally every Week : Beef very seldom. There are three little Fairs, scarcely deserving the Name, on the 12th of March, 5th of August, and 11th of December. A great proportion of this Parish is Common : it varies in length from four miles and an half to seven miles, and from two miles and an half in breadth to three miles and an half. The little river Alan divides the Church-yard on the West, from the rest of the Close. Over this river, to the South West, stood the Bishop's Palace, for merly a very magnificent Building. There is a Tradition, that King Henry the Eighth had once a design of removing the Episcopal See from hence to Caermarthen ; but that he desisted from this intention, when he was informed, S"], [174, "D A V that the Bones of his Grandfather, Edmund Earl of Richmond, were interred there. Here is the Tomb of the celebrated Giraldus Cambrensis. The Isle of Ramsey, which is part of the Parish of St. David's, is about two miles in length, and about one mile in breadth. It is situate near a Promontory on St. George's Channel, called St. David's Head. This is supposed to have been the Mantavis of Ravennas, and the Promontorium Octorupium of Ptolomey. The whole neighbourhood abounds with remains of Druidical monuments. According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Augmentation, fixed Stipend, and Surplice fees, was \u00a359-1 1-6. \u2014 The present worthy Minister, The Rev. John Jones, most obligingly adds, \" Here are the vestiges of two Chapels now in ruins, viz., St. Nun's, and St. Justinian's: There have also been other Chapels, as it is said, but there are now little or no remains of them. Here is a Public Grammar School, called The Free School. The Master is paid \u00a310. a year by the^Canons, for teaching the four Choristers. The Building, in which the Free School was formerly kept, was repaired by the Canons about Eighteen years ago, and converted into two elegant Rooms, viz., a Chapter Room, and a Dining Room for the reception of Company at St. James-tide, when the Canons hold their Audit. The School is now kept in the old Chapter Room. The West end ofthe Cathedral, which, it was appre hended, was on the point of falling down, was repaired in a handsome manner, about Fifteen years ago, at a very considerable expense, which was defrayed partly by the Canons, and the remainder by Subscription.\" \u2014 This See, now the Seat of a Suffragan Bishop, was once the Metropolitan See of Wales, and Archi-Epis copal; and for many years the Seat of the Supreme Ordinary of the Welsh. When Christianity was first planted in Great Britain, there were three Arch bishops' seats appointed, viz., London (afterwards removed to Canterbury), York, and Caerleon upon Usk, in the County of Monmouth. That at Caer leon being found to be too near to the Dominions of the Saxons, was removed, in the time of Arthur King of the Britons, to a place called Mynyw, in the farthest part of Pembrokeshire ; but since, in honour of the Archbishop who translated it here in some part of the Sixth Century, it is called St. David's. It is from the first Name that the Bishops style themselves Menevensis. Bishop Sampson was the last of the Archbishops of St. David's ; for he withdrawing himself, on account of a Pestilence which raged here about the year 930, to Dole in Britanny, he carried the Pall with him. Yet his Successors, though they lost the Name, still preserved the Archiepiscopal power ; for the Welsh"], [175, "D E D Bishops still continued to receive consecration at his hands, till the reign of Henry the First, when Bernard, the Forty-seventh Bishop, was forced to sub mit himself to the Church of Canteibury. The Church standing so near the Sea, frequently felt the desolating hand of the Danes, Norwegians, and other Pirates, and was spoiled and ruined. The Church that now remains was erected by Bishop Peter, the Forty-ninth Bishop, and was dedicated to St. Andrew and St. David; though now St. Andrew be omitted. It hath given one Saint to the Church, and to the Nation three Lord Treasurers, one Lord Privy Seal, a Chancellor to the Queen, and another to the University of Oxford. This Dio cese contains the entire Counties of Pembroke Caermarthen, Brecknock, and Radnor (five Parishes of the latter excepted), with some small parts of the Counties of Monmouth, Hereford, Montgomery, and Glamorgan. It hath four Archdeaconries, viz., Brecknock, Cardigan, Caermarthen, and St. David's. The See is valued in the King's Books at ,\u00a3426. . 2. .1, and is computed to be worth anually \u00a31400. To this Cathedral belong a Bishop, a Precentor with the power of a Dean, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, four Archdeacons, nineteen Prebendaries, eight Vicars Choral, four Choristers, and other infe rior Officers. The Chapter consists of the Precentor, the Treasurer, the Chan cellor, and three Canons, elected from the Archdeaconries and Prebendaries. The Lower Chapter is a Body Corporate, having lands within its own Jurisdic tion, and granting Leases under its own Seal, without the interference of the Dignitaries. According to Bishop Tanner, a College for a Master and seven Priests was sounded here by John Duke of Lancaster and Blanch his wife, and Adam Houghton or Hutton, Bishop of St. David's, in the year 1365. It was dedicated to St. Mary; and, 26\u00b0 Hen. VIII., had revenues of \u00a3l 11.. 16-4 per ami. in the whole, and \u00a3lo6..3..6 clear. It was dissolved in the reign of King Edward the Sixth. Mr. Owen informs us, that Richard Davies, D.D., Bishop of St. Asaph from 1559 to I56I, was in the latter year translated to St. David's : he was the Coadjutor of William Salesbury in translating the New Testament into Welsh : he was also one of those eminent Scholars who were employed by Queen Elizabeth in making the English version of the Bible: He died in I58I, aged 80 years: in the early'part of his Life he was the Poet ical disciple of Lewis Dwn.

In this Parish, according to Mr. Jones, are three Chapels, intended for the ease of the Inhabitants of the different Hamlets of this extensive Tract. The Church being situate at the Lower end ofthe Vale of Senni is appropriated principally for the use and accommoda tion ofthe Residents there, as well as for the greatest part of Maescar; the Chapel of Llan Hid for those of Crai ; Llan Illtyd for those of Glynn Tared and Cwm Camlais in Maescar : and Cell Wen for the distant Parishioners in the Upper end of Glynn Tawy and the Neighbourhood : All of these Chapels have been augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty. There are numerous Cam eddau on the Hills, and also Barrows in the Vales, within this Parish. There are Seven Mills, called The Lords'' Mills, complained of as grievances, in this and the adjoining Parishes, viz., at Defynoc, Senni, Crai, Ystrad Fellte, Glynn Tawy, Llywel, and Pwll Coch. Upon the Attainder of Stafford Duke of Buck ingham, they became the Property of the Crown ; Queen Elizabeth, in the Thir tieth year of her reign, granted them to one of the Herberts of Crickadarn for Sixty years, at \u00a343-6.. 8 per annum: a few years afterwards the Trustees of the Grantee filed a Bill in the Exchequer against some Tenants of the Manor for not bringing their Cora to be ground at one of those Mills ; and, in 1653, the right of compelling them so to do was not only established by a Decree of"], [177, "D E F the Court, but two New Mills, one in Ystrad Fellte and the other in Cwm Camlais, were directed to be pulled down. This odious exercise of Authority is not peculiar to the Lordship of Brecknock, and though it be not now main tained with all its former rigour, it should be totally abolished, not only as being oppressive to Individuals, but because it is injurious to the Community : These Mills now belong to the Lords of The Great Forest. The Great For est of Defynoc contains a space of at least 20,000 acres of Land within the Parishes of Defynoc, Llywel, Ystrad Gynlais, Ystrad Fellte, and Pen Derin, and anciently appertained to the Lordship of Brecknock. Under the ancient Lords Marchers, the Forest Laws were enforced with the greatest severity. King Richard the Second, in the First year of his reign, granted to the Tenants Resiants and Inhabitants of this Tract, free liberty and passage through the same, with water and pasture for their Beasts and Cattle throughout the same, on payment to his said Highness, for every Poll of Beasts and Cattle, one Penny, after the rate and computation of Cyfrif, known by usage of the said Forest : Which Grant was afterwards confirmed by Jnspeximus of King Henry the Eighth, in the Thirtieth year of his reign. The Computation of the Cyfrif or Reckoning was, as follows : One Ox, or Cow. . Two Bullocks . . . . j A Cyfrif, or the Sum of one Two yearling Beasts not come to the Yoke. \\> Penny, for Pasturage or Agist- Two Heifers before they have Calves. j ment. Twelve Sheep. .... J No Lambs, or Goats, pay. Swine pay to the Farmers of the Mills. In The Little Forest they had no claim to these Privileges. Previous to this Grant, it is said, they paid Three Pence a Cyfrif. After the Attainder of the Duke of Bucking ham, King Henry the Eighth granted this part of his Possessions to Sir Thomas Seymour, afterwards Lord Seymour, of Sudley and Lord High Admiral: Upon whose Attainder it again reverted to the Crown. In the Ninth of Queen Elizabeth, the Agistments, &c, of The Great Forest (excepting and reserving all wild Beasts and Fallow Deer, with pasturage and pannage for the same, ex cepting also all Timber trees, Woods, Underwoods, Mines, and Quarries) were granted in Lease of twenty-one years to William Jones, paying annually to the Crown \u00a320. .6. .8, which, from time to time, was renewed to himself and Heirs. In the Tenth of George the First, a similar Lease was granted to Wil liam Morgan of Tredegar, and has ever since been continued upon the same"], [178, "D E F terms to his Representatives. About twenty-four years ago, a dispute arose between the Crown Tenant and. the Tenants Resiants of the Manor, respecting payment of Cymmorth, and other customary Dues, which were refused by the Defendants : but it was at length determined by a legal decision, that such Payment should be made. \u2014 The Little Forest in this Parish anciently be longed to the Lords of Brecknock, but, upon the Forfeiture of that property, it was ever afterwards dissevered from The Great Forest of Brecknock. Henry the Eighth, in the latter end of his reign, granted this Tract with other pos sessions to Thomas Lord Seymour of Sudley, High Admiral of Great Britain; upon his Attainder, in 1548, it was again forfeited to the Crown, who after wards bestowed it upon some Favourite, from whom, or his Descendants, it was purchased, and during the last Century it was at different times and in shares in the Families of Rake, St. Loe, Edgar, and Fountain. The Lands, but not the Manor, have lately been sold to the Tenants and other Purchasers, except a ninth share, which cannot at present be disposed of, in consequence of the Nonage of the Proprietor. The Little Forest, the Priory Lands, Tir y March og, or The Knight's Land, and Lands being Parcel of the Manor or Lordship of East Greenwich, all within the Parish of Defynoc, were exempted from the Customs, and grievous Services of the Mills. Upon the Western bank of the Senni, near its junction with the river Usk, in this Parish, are the small remains of a Castellated building, called indiscriminately Senni Castle, and Rhyd y Briw Castle : But it is apprehended to have been the Lodge, occupied by the Constable or Ranger of the Forest; in which situation was Thomas Awbrey, the fourth in descent from Sir Reginald Awbrey, who accompanied Bernard de Newmarch to Brecknock. In the second of Charles the First, an Alms house for the Support of Five poor persons of honest Life and Conversation, within the Parish of Defynoc, or in default, from the Hamlet of Ts Clydach in Llywel, was founded by the Representatives of Sir John Davy, then Owner of the Little Forest; who also, in 1624, founded and endowed a Free School within the Parish, with a Sum for annually putting out Apprentices from among the poor Children, educated therein: the Trustees are the Vicar, and eleven substantial Inhabitants of the Parish, chosen by election ; the Vicar being always one. The repairs of the Bridges upon all the Streams, except that at Defynoc, which is a Parish bridge, are at the expense ofthe Inhabitants ofthe Hundred. The Bishop of Gloucester enjoys one Third of the whole profits of the Living ; the Third, belonging to the Priory of Brecknock, was granted to"], [179, "DEN Sir David Williams, from whom it went to his Grandson, David Williams of Corndon, in the County of Gloucester, who demised it for a term to the first Daniel Williams, of Pen Pont ; it has been since purchased, and is now the property of Penry Williams, Esq. ; the other third of the Tythes belongs of course to the Vicar, who has the Nomination to the Curacies of the augmented Chapels in this Parish. The Vicarage House, to which there is about an acre of Glebe Land attached, was nearly rebuilt twice during the last Century ; first in 1720, and again about thirty years ago by the late Rev. H. Vaughan, then Vicar, when great additions were made to it. The Petty Sessions for the Hundred of Defynoc are holden here.

The Fairs are holden on Friday se'nnight before Easter day, 14th of May, 19th ot\" July, 25th of September, and the second Wednesday after the 1st of November. This Town, in conjunction with the free Burgesses of Holt, and Rhuthyn, send one Member to Parliament : the Bailiffs are the Returning Officers. The Cor- poration, according to the Charter of 14\u00b0 Charles IL, consists of two Aldermen, two Bailiffs, a Recorder, and two Coroners, who are annually appointed from the Twenty-five Capital Burgesses. Here is an endowed Free School. The Epiphany and Trinity Quarter Sessions are holden here. This Parish is nearly five miles in length, and not quite one mile in breadth, and is all inclosed and cultivated. It was originally situate on the Summit of a sleep Rock, near the Western bank of the river Clwyd; but being deserted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a new Town was built, on a much larger scale, at the foot of the Hill. This part of the County was given by Edward the First to Dafydd ab Grufydd, the Brother of Llywelyn, the last Prince of Wales, who being after- wards put to death, in the year 1283, by a Parliament holden at Shrewsbury, it was given to Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, who fortified the Town with a strong Wall and Castle ; after this Earl's death, the Castle went, by the marriage of Alice, his daughter, into the possession of the House of Lancaster. Edward"], [180, "DER the Second p-ave it to Hugh Spencer ; after which, in the reign os Edward the Third, Roger Mortimer became the Proprietor, and fixed his Arms on the principal gate ; but he being some time after executed for High Treason, it went to Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, but was soon after restored to the Mor timers. And finally, after many changes, it came to the House of York, and now belongs to the Crown. It was delivered up to the Parliament army in 1646, and appears to have been a place of such great strength, that, after the Restoration, it was deemed advisable to blow it up. The prospect from hence is delightful along the beautiful Vale of Clwyd, which is interspersed with Gentlemen's Seats. According to Bishop Tanner, at the very East end ofthe Town was a House of Carmelite or White Friars, dedicated to St. Mary, and founded, as some think, by John Salisbury, who died in the year 1289 : but, as others, by John de Sunimore, in 1399- It was granted, 36\u00b0 Hen. VIII., to Richard Andrews and William L'lsle. Leland speaks of an Alms-house here, which was desolate in his time. The learned Antiquary, Humphrey Llwyd, was a native of this Town ; where he practised as a Physician, and also repre sented it in Parliament. He died at the age of Forty-one, in the year 1 568 : his various Publications are well known. DENIO, v. PWLLHELI.

This Castle, which is now totally destroy ed, stood upon a pointed Knoll, in the Forest Hamlet ofthe Parish of Talgarth ; and jointly with the Castle of Blaen Llyfni, gave the title of Baron to John Fitz- Reginald, who was summoned to Parliament by the title of Baron Fitz Regi nald ofJBlaen Llyfni and Dinas, in the reigns of the two first Edwards. It was probably first erected by the Barons Marchers of the Country, to curb the bold T"], [182, "D I N incursions of the Natives, who for a great length of time continued to possess strong-holds in the narrow Vales, and wild recesses of the Black Mountains of Talgarth ; and who seized every opportunity of retaliating upon their oppres- sors the injuries which they had sustained. From the description of Leland it must have been of considerable dimensions, consisting of three Wards \" waullid abowte :\" and having three Parks, and a Forest. From the same writer we learn, that the Fabrick was destroyed by the Natives, that it might not be occu- pied by the favourers of Owain Glandwr. At that time, Mortimer, who had joined in the Rebellion of that noted Chieftain, was the Lord of Dinas, and its destruction was, in all probability, accomplished by the means of David Gam, who had vast influence in the County of Brecknock, of which he was a Native, and was a strenuous partizan ofthe House of Lancaster. The Lordship of Dinas, with the other property ofthe Mortimers, upon the death ofthe last Edmund, descended to Richard Duke of York, the Son of his Sister Anne, in the third year of King Henry the Sixth ; and merged in the Crown, as the Inheritance of King Edward the Fourth. King James the First granted it to Sir Richard Grobham, Knt., by whom it was sold to Sir David Williams, one of the Judges of the .Court of King's Bench in that reign; whose remote descendant, Sir Edward Williams, sold it, a few years since, to John Macnamara, Esq., the present Proprietor.

He translated the Psalms of David into Welsh metre, and had a great concern T2"], [184, "D I S in regulating the Welsh Prosody. He flourished between the years 1310 and 1360 ; and a very poetical translation of his of the Office of the Blessed Virgin, is printed in the Welsh Archaiology. There is also in the Church a cross leo-ged fio-ure of Sir Thomas Pounderling, who, it would seem, had attained the merit of Pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. The Church is built on the declivity of one of the Clwydian Hills ; and its situation is esteemed one of the most beautiful spots on earth, for the extent, variety, and grandeur of the pros pects which it affords.

It is a peculiarity that this Church points N. E. and S. W , which no other one, excepting St. Chad's, in Shrewsbury, does. The Church is in the gift of the Majority of the Landholders of that part of the parish, called Uwch Cell, who pay Sixpence in the pound, old Survey, to the Licensed Minister, which gives them the right of nomination.

The Harbour of Fishguard is of an irregular form, but capacious and easy of access, having neither Rock nor Bar at its entry, which is about 1160 feet wide, and in length about 2400 ; but it is greatly in want of a proper Pier. The Irish Packets often put in here. There are the ruins of an ancient Ecclesiastical building, called Cappel Llanfi hangel, in the East end of the Parish ; and also the ruins of two other Churches, called Llan Fartin and Llanist ; and it is supposed, that the modern Parish of Fishguard composed two Parishes, before the present Church was built. It was formerly part of the possessions of the Abbey of St. Dogmael's, and granted away at the dissolution of Religious Houses, in the reign of King Henry the Eighth. The Impropriate Tythes are the property of Richard Bowen, Esq. : The Vicar has one third of the great and small Tythes of that part of the Parish, on the West side of the river Gwayn, and the Impropriator the other two ; But of the Hamlet of Cappel Llanfihangel to the Eastward of the river, both the great and small Tythes, as well as those of Herrings and other Fish, belong to the Impropriator alone.

According to the Report made to Parliament, in 1803, it appears, that the House of Industry of the United District of Montgomery and Pool (an expensive Fabrick, erected about the year 1795), is situate in this Parish. This District, which is about eighteen miles from North to South, and nearly the same distance from East to West, comprises eighteen Parishes and Townships, in the Counties of Montgomery and Salop. These Places were incorporated by the Act of 32\u00b0 Geo. 3. c. 96., and additional powers were given to the Corporation by the 36\u00b0 Geo. 3. c. 38. The manage ment of this Establishment is vested in twenty-one Directors, who are chosen out of the guardians ; seven of whom are changed every year. There are also nine Honorary Directors elected annually ; four of whom are the Bailiffs or Chief Magistrates of the Boroughs of Montgomery and Pool. The House is managed by a Steward and Matron, under the Superintendance of Committees. A Committee, formed of two or more Directors, attend at the House of Indus try almost daily. The Board, formed of three or more Directors, sit at the House every Wednesday, attended by their Solicitor. Two hundred and forty-four Paupers were maintained, on the average, in the House, during the year 1803 : the number of Out-Poor, who were relieved permanently, during that year, was sour hundred and thirty; of whom, 97 were Children under five years of age, and 96 from five to fourteen years of age: the number of Poor re lieved occasionally was three hundred and eighty six ; and one Pauper, who was not a Parishioner of the District. Of the whole number of Poor relieved, three hundred and seventy six were above sixty years of age, or disabled from labour by permanent illness, or other infirmity. The Poor in the House are chiefly employed in making Flannel of inferior Wool ; they are also employed in the Linen Manufacture, and in making Shoes ; and likewise in the Garden, on"], [211, "F R E the Farm, and on the necessary household affairs. The House has the follow ing Lands attached to it; Munlin Farm, about 140 acres, which is holden under Lease ; The Gaer Mill and Lands, about 8 acres, also holden under Lease ; and Hems Woods, on which the House stands and which is holden by Grant, about 24 acres. There are good Meadow and Pasture Lands. About twenty acres are sown annually with wheat, and the same number of acres with other grain. A Dairy of twenty Cows is kept, which supplies the younger part of the Fa mily, at all. times of the year, with Milk. A Team is kept, and employed in cultivating the Lands, and drawing Coals and other Fuel to the House. The Corn-Mill is found beneficial to the Corporation. A small Engine is attached to it, for throwing water up to the House ; and Corn is ground for Money, for such Housekeepers of the United District as choose to send it to the Mill. All expenses attending this Establishment (including In and Out Poor, interest of Money borrowed to erect the House, 8cc.) are defrayed out of one general Fund in the Treasurer's hands ; which Fund is formed by a Monthly Assessment, made by a Board of five Directors, on each of the eighteen places in the Dis trict, in the proportion of a perpetually fixed Quota or Rate, settled at the com mencement of the Institution by Commissioners under the Act. The amount of this Assessment on each place is paid to the Treasurers ofthe House by the Overseers of that Place, out of Money raised by them by the Poor's Rate, under the general Poor Laws. The Pay to the Out-Poor is ordered weekly by the Directors, and paid by the Overseers of the Places where the Paupers reside, without attention to the particular places in which they have legal settlements ; the whole District being considered, in this respect, the same as a single Parish, in consequence ofthe Quotas being unalterable.

This Parish is supposed to contain about 13,000 acres of Land ; of which, the Township of Sea-land, consisting of about 4000 acres and in part recovered from the Sea, was inclosed, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament passed in the year 173.2 by The River Dee Company ; the Township of Saltney, consisting of about \u00a30'.'0 acres, was inclosed in 1778 ; and that part, called The Warren Mountain, consisting of about 600 acres, being part of the Townships of Broughton, Pentre Hobyn, and Banael, was inclosed according to an Act obtained in the year 1798 ; and all the rest are inclosed and cultivated, except about 1200 acres. The Castle suffered, during the Civil Wars, the usual vicissi tudes of fortune ; and on the 22d. of December 1645, was by vote of Parliament ordered to be dismantled : and its destruction was further effected by its owner, Sir William Glynne, between the years 1665 and 1678.

This Sum is to be paid to the Lord of the Manor, and other Trustees; and is applicable to any uses which any five (with the consent of the Lord) shall agree on. \u2014 The present most worthy and intelligent Rector, The Rev. Randulph Crewe, in the kindest manner adds, \" The Name of this Parish is always written Hawarden; but constantly pronounced Hardin or Harden. Whe ther Hawarden be a Saxon word, or a compound of Saxon and Welsh, is uncer tain : many names of Townships and Places in this Neighbourhood seem to be such ; or Welsh so corrupted or Anglicized as to be difficult to be well ascer tained. The fancy that one of the Family of the Dukes of Norfolk concealed C c"], [238, "HAW himself here, 'and thence called Howard's Den, is a groundless Fiction. Hardin or Harden is supposed to be an English word ; but more probably is of Welsh derivation. It seems to be formed of two Welsh words, Garth, a Hill, and Din, a contraction of Dinas, a Fortress ; and as it is usual in Welsh to drop the initial letter G., and to make mutations in certain constructions and compound words, Ardddin, Ardin, and aspirated Hardin or Harden, a Fortified Mount or Hill. The Castle, which is of great Antiquity, stands on a Conical Mount or Hill. The Welsh Name of this Parish is Peuariag, or, Penarddlag, i. e. Pen Garth y Lac, the Top of the Hill or rising ground above the Quicksands or Swamps, with which the Marsh of the river Dee, called Saltney, lying between here and Chester, formerly abounded: apart of which Marsh lying in the adjoining Parish of Dodleston, yet remaining uninclosed, is called Each Eyes, Lag's Eyes or Springs. Until about an Hundred years ago, or later, there was little or no connection between the Inhabitants of this Parish and those of the adjoining Parishes of Hope, Mold, and Northop. The Commons formerly lying between this Parish and Hope and Mold, though scarcely half a mile broad, completely separated the two Languages and almost all intercourse ; as did the narrow Dingle, called Wybre, i. e., The Gutter, between this Parish and Northop. In most of the old Townships of Hawarden are considerable Coal mines, from which Chester and the adjacent Country are and have been principally supplied from time immemorial: there are raised annually about 70,000 Tons. In the Townships of Pentre Hobyn and Ewloe there is an extensive Mine of very fine Fire Clay; of which, upwards of 14,000 Tons are annually made into Bricks bearers, flooring, malt and ridge Tiles : and also a large Manufactory of coarse Earthen-ware for Household and Dairy use. In the Town of Hawarden is an extensive Iron Foundry ; and in the Township of Saltney, is a lar\u00b0-e Manufac ture of Glauber Salts, Sal ammoniac, Ivory Bhck, 8cc. : the Coals, Bricks, and Pottery are conveyed down to the River Dee by Iron Rail-ways. The Language spoken in this Parish has been, for several Centuries, English ; yet many places and fields still retain their Welsh names. The Inhabitants of Hawarden have been for many ages, and are still, called by the nick-name of Hardin Jews. The reason of which is supposed to be best explained by the following Ac count, preserved and current in the Parish for time immemorial, and said to be a Translation of an ancient Saxon Manuscript. \" In the sixth year of the reign of Cynan ap Elis ap Anarawd, king of Gwynedd North or Wales, which was in the year 946, there was in the Christian Temple, at a place called"], [239, "HAW Hardin in the Kingdom of North Wales, a Rood Loft, in which was placed an image of the Virgin Mary with a very large Cross, which was in the hands of the image, called Holy Rood. About this time there happened a very hot and dry Summer, so dry that there was not grass for the cattle. Upon which most of the Inhabitants went and prayed to the image or Holy Rood that it would cause it to rain, but to no purpose: Amongst the rest, the Lady Trawst, whose husband's name was Sytsyllt, a Nobleman and Governor of Hardin Castle, went to pray to the said Holy Rood; and she praying earnestly and long, the image or Ho ly Rood fell down upon her head, and killed her. Upon which a great uproar was raised, and it was concluded and resolved upon to try the said image for the murder of the said Lady Trawst ; and a Jury was summoned for the purpose, whose names were as follow, Hincot of Hancot , Span of Mancot, Leach and Each, and Comberbach ; Feet and Pale, with* Corbin of the Gate, Milling and Hughet, with Gill and Pughel. Who upon examination of evidences declared the said Lady Trawst to be wil fully murdered by the said Holy Rood, and guilty of the murder : and also guilty in not answering the many petitioners. But whereas the said Holy Rood being very old and decayed, she was ordered to be hanged : but Span opposed that sentence, saying as they wanted rain, it would be best to drown her: but that was fiercely opposed by Corbin, who answered as she was Holy Rood they had no right to kill her ; and he advised them to lay her on the Sands of the river below Hardin Castle, from whence they might see what became of her ; which was accordingly done. Soon after which the Tide from the Sea came and carried the said image to some low land, being an Island, near the Walls of a City called Caer Leon (now, Chester), where it was found the next day, drowned and dead: whereupon the Inhabitants of Caer Leon buried it at the place where it was discovered ; and erected a + Monument of stone over it, with this inscription, \u2014 \u2022 There is a descendant of this Corbin, believed in the direct male line, now living at the House, called The Gate, i. e. from its situation near the Gate ofthe Castle ; and in possession of part ofthe same Free hold, with a family of three sons and four daughters.

If a Pier was run out to the South- East from the Salt House, on the South Point of The Salt Island, within which large Vessels might lie afloat; and the North sound, and the sound of Parry's Island, walled up, it would prevent the swell in the Harbour ; all this might be done at the expense of about \u00a38000., it would then be a safe Harbour, but now it is only one ofthe rough Drafts of Nature, without the helping hand of man.

The Mark, or Place where the Vessels lie to receive or discharge their loading, is about two miles from the Turnpike Gate. The Channel of the Holywell river is to be seen at low water meandering to it, and might prove an useful means of improving the Commerce of the Country. At present, the Vessels must, on the recess ofthe Tide, lie dry, and in hard gales, before they get afloat, are subject to much danger. The sands also shift, and make The Mark or anchoring ground often precarious.

Immediately over the Fountain is the Legend of St. Wenefrede, on a pendent projection, with the arms of England at the bottom. Numbers of fine ribs secure the Arch, whose intersections are coupled with a sculpture. Over this Spring is a Chapel, ofthe same date with the other building: a neat piece of Gothic architecture ; but in a very ruinous state.

Its more ancient British name is Aber Cor an, descriptive of its site at the con fluence ofthe river Corah, which empties itself into the Sea, a little below the Castle. Tradition says, that the Parish Church formerly stood upon a Farm, called Craseland, i. e., Christ's Land : but no vestige now remains, of any such edifice there.

The Characters noticed by the Bishop, are inscribed upon the upright supporting stones within the hollow, but not in the exact order in which he has given them ; being scattered without any apparent ref erence to each other. That St. Illtyd had a Hermitage here is recorded by Gi raldus Cambrensis ; and several neighbouring Places still bear his name, as Maen Illtyd, Tir Illtyd, Ffynnon Illtyd, Ice. It is not improbable that the mor tified Habits of the Saint might have induced him to make his Bed within the hollow of a Cislfaen, but he could not have sat upright in it : the Characters may, perhaps, have been inscribed by him.

This Parish is situate in the beautiful Vale of Tywi, and is happily circumstanced by natural advantages of good Air, and Chalybeate Springs; the latter of which have been generously brought forth to the benefit of every one, by the Liberality of Sir William Paxton, at Avhose expense they have been subjected to the Analysis of Doctors Saunders and Babington, These Springs are about a mile distant from the Village, within the Park of Myddleton Hall, where Sir William has erected Hot and Cold Baths for the accommodation of Visitors. The immediate Site ofthe Village of Llan Arthne is adjacent to the Turnpike Road, along which the Mail Coach passes daily from London to Milford. The Roads are excel lent ; and the Country is abundant, and cheap. But it must be acknowledged, that Llan Arthne, formerly so entirely neglected, owes its present state of Cultivation and Beauty to the highly meritorious and unwearied Efforts of Sir William Paxton. To heighten the natural Views of this delightful Vale, Sir William is now erecting on a conspicuous Eminence, within his Domain, a grand Castellated Edifice, designed to honour the Memory of the Immortal Nelson: And from which the Prospect will be most extensive, and rich. The splendid Mansion of Myddleton Hall yields to none in the Principality, in its Architecture and internal Elegance of Decoration. The remains of an ancient Family Seat, now comprising the dwelling-house and offices of a highly re spectable Farmer, are to be seen at Cappel Ddewi in this Parish. Another ancient Building is at Cappel Ddewi Isaf, the present owner of which projects its restoration. The Church of Llan Arthne has lately been beautified and adorned at a considerable expense, and exhibits a neat Temple of Divine worship. According to Tradition, the present Church is built 400 yards distant from the original Parish Church, due North, which was carried away by an overflowing of the river Tywi: the Site whereof is to this day called Hen Llan, i. e., The Old Church. The ancient Chapel of Cappel Ddewi, four miles distant from the Parish Church, on the Banks of the river Tywi, is nearly ruinated.

The Suffragan Bishop of Llan Badarn Fawr was one of the seven Bishops who had conference with Augustine the Monk, who was desirous of establishing his own supremacy over the British Church.

This appears to have been a much larger place formerly than at present ; and the Number of its Inhabitants gave them some consequence, as frequent mention is made, in the Welsh Chronicle, of The Men of St. Peter having accomplished some Action or other: and this is further confirmed by a piece of Ground to the South West of the Town, still called Mynwent Twmas, i. e., St. Thomas's Church-yard, in which pieces of Leaden coffins are frequently dug up: the Tradition is, that the ruins ofthis Church were standing about Two hundred years ago, and the Street, leading to it, is called St. Thomas's Street.

Some Stone and Tim ber have already been provided for the College : And \" The Committee\" have published the following Report. \" Report of the Committee on a proposed Establishment for the Education of young Men intended for Orders, who are precluded the Advantages cf an University Education. \" The distance of this Diocese from the Universities, and the poverty of the greater part of its Benefices, place an University Education out of the reach of most Candidates for Orders. It has therefore long been the wish of some zealous Friends of Religion and the Establishment, to provide some Kk2"], [296, "L L A appropriate and effectual means of Clerical Education within the Diocese. The steps which have led to the Plan now proposed to the Patronage of the Public, may be seen in the Appendix to the Anniversary Sermon. \"At the meeting of the Rural Deans on the 2d of July, 1806, it was proposed to build Lodging-rooms at Ystradmeirig for the Society's Exhibitioners. Upon inquiry since made, it appears, that there are local difficulties, which render this situation not so convenient as was expected. These difficulties have induced the Society to think Llanddewi Brefi a preferable situation. The Parish of Llanddewi Brefi is part of a Manor belonging to the Bishop of St. David's, who is willing to grant to the Society ground enough for the necessary building, garden, 8cc. Llanddewi Brefi recommends itself also on several other accounts, as a place of education for the Ministry: such as, its seclusion from populous Society ; \u2014 its vicinity to some of the Bishop's best patronage, which might serve as rewards to the ability .ind diligence of the' Masters; \u2014 its spacious Church, which is large enough to accommodate a numerous Society ; \u2014 its convenience for stone, fuel, 8cc. \u2014 and its healthy situation. Llanddewi Brefi at present ap- pears the preferable situation, because no other has been suggested, which pos sesses so many advantages, or which has not some counterbalancing disadvan tages. But choice of situation is still open to the Society, and the Committee earnestly solicit communication and advice from all friends to the proposed Establishment. \" An establishment, for the purpose of Clerical education will bring the plans of the Society into earlier maturity than the proposed Lodging-rooms at Ystrad meirig ; which were judged eligible chiefly on account -\u00bbf their intended vicinity to a very valuable school long established. But in the new situation the Sem inary will assume the form (which the Society has always had ultimately in view) of an establishment, which does not aspire to the dignities and advantages of Uni versity education ; but will embrace a course of professionai studies, which the most learned and accomplished School-master cannot provide for his pupils. In the seminary of Llanddewi Brefi it is intended to have distinct courses of Lectures, \" 1. On Theology and Christian morals; \"2. On Languages; Hebrew, Greek, and Latin ; \"3- On Elocution, and the Study ofthe Welsh Lansuao-e ; ' 0,0\" \" 4. On Church History, and Church Establishments ; with especial reference to our own Church ;"], [297, "L L A \" 5. On the duties of the Clerical profession ; and the existing laws relative to the Church. \"It appears that a sum not less than TenThousand Pounds will be necessary for building Apartments for a Master, and Three Lecturers, and Rooms for. Thirty Students, with the requisite Appendages ; exclusive of what will be required for the permanent maintenance of Masters and Students. It is proposed to begin the Building as soon as Two Thousand Pounds are subscribed and received. \" The Society's first intentions are confined to the Building of a House suffi cient for the residence of a Master, with Lodging-rooms attached to the House for eight Students, with a Library (which also will serve as a Lecture-room), and a Dining room. These two rooms will be so arranged, as to be convertible into Lodging-rooms, whenever the Society's Finances are competent to increase the number of Scholars, and to build a distinct Dining-room and Library. The first Establishment will be proportioned to the Society's present means, and consequently much short of the extent to which it is intended to be carried according as the Society's Finances for this object increase. \" The Society are in possession of two Plans for the Building of the Seminary ; one by a liberal Benefactor to the Society, and another by an experienced Architect. Till the intended Building is ready to receive the Masters and Students, the proposed Exhibitions for Scholars at Ystradmeirig School continue open, as is provided for by the Fund for Clerical Education; which is at present sufficient for five Exhibitions of ten Pounds a year each. \" The Seminary at Llanddewi Brefi will not at all supersede the usual term of classical education at School; as no Scholars will be admissible at Llanddewi Brefi who are not nineteen years of age, and who have not passed at least four years at one of the licenced Grammar Schools in the Diocese. \" The Committee have only to add, that the Society have to provide 1. For the building ofthe Seminary ; 2. For the salary of the Master or Masters ; 3. For the maintenance ofthe Students. \" A Seminary intended to facilitate the means of Education to future Candi dates for Orders in this Diocese, who are precluded the advantages of an Uni versity Education; to remove impediments, which have contributed to the growth of Schism ; and to advance the usefulness and credit of the established Church, is an object, which the Committee hope will meet the approbation and savour of all friends of Religion, Charity, and Learning, who have no connec tion with the Principality ; but they look forward with confidence to a zealous"], [298, "L L A and liberal encouragement of their endeavours from its more opulent natives, and from all who partake of the patrimony of the Church in this Diocese, whether Incumbents, Sine-Cure Rectors, or Impropriators.

Two premiums often pounds each, for dissertations on subjects relative to the several objects of the society. 3. A premium often pounds for eight sermons, to be preached on the eight Sundays subsequent to Easter-day, on the principles and duties of church union \u2014 on errors arising from unsettled notions in religion \u2014 and on the ex cellence ofthe Liturgy of the Church of England. 4- A premium of twenty shillings worth of books, for the best proficients at the Easter examination of scholars at the licensed grammar schools in the diocese ; \u2014 for the recitation of sermons by the divinity scholars at the said schools ; \u2014 and for the best abridg ment of sermons by the said scholars. 5.

Two courses of sixteen lectures are read in each archdeaconry, and eight guineas are allotted for each course. 6. The establishment of deanery libraries. \"II. Benefactions for Exhibitions. The interest of monies in the fund for cler ical education and exhibitions is allotted, at present, to the payment of exhibi tions to divinity scholars at Ystradmeirig school, elected annually on the Tues day preceding the first Thursday in July, to continue four years from the day of their admission into Ystradmeirig school. The fund arises from contributions by the Clergy, of one-tenth of the annual Income of their Benefices for one year, during their incumbency, and from the contributions of other benefactors, expressly limited to this purpose. The interest of this fund, with its two annual subscriptions, is at present equal to five exhibitions of ten pounds per annum. This fund, when the intended building is ready for their reception, will be transferred to the maintenance of scholars at the clerical seminary. \" III. Benefactions for the Building at Llanddewi Brefi. The interest of the bene-"], [299, "L L A Factions for the building and establishing of a clerical seminary, until the build ing is begun, will be applied, if it should be required, and as far only as occasion may require, to the augmentation of the fund for exhibitions. By aid ofthe first and second of the foremerttionsd funds, the ends othe intended seminary are, in effect, now carrying on in a limited degree, partly by premiums to direct the studies and excite the emulation of tfie Scholars of all the licensed gram mar schools ; and partly, by appropriating to one of these schools exhibitions for the maintenance of divinity scholars, during the four years immediately pre ceding the full age for deacon's orders. A preference is given to the said school, principally, because by such selection of one schoolthe education of the exhibitioners may be made to approach the nearer to the pianos the pro posed establishment at Llanddewi Brefi. \"IV. Benefactions for superannuated Curates. The object ofthis fund is to en able curates who are superannuated, or disabled by incurable infirmity, to retire from duties to which they are become incompetent, and is calculated not only for the relief of worthy individuals who are labouring under age and infirmities, but also for the benefit of the incumbent, who is paying for services imper fectly discharged, and ofthe parish, which suffers in many ways by the super annuation of its officiating minister.

It is 29 m. N.E. from Caermarthen, and 181 m. W. b. N. from London. The Market is on Saturday, which is well supplied, and attended ; and there was formerly another on Wednesday, but which has been, for sev- eral years, almost, if not altogether, discontinued. The Fairs are holden on the Wednesday after the 17th of January, Wednesday after Easter- Week, Whit- sun-Tuesday, 31st of July, Wednesday after 10th of October, and 26th of November. It is supposed to take its Name from its situation near the conflu- ence of the rivers Bran, and Gwydderig ; and about a quarter of a mile South from the Tywi. This Town is of considerable Antiquity, and, doubtless, had its origin in the Roman Station, which was at or near Llan Fair ar y Brynn about balsa mile from hence: For that the Romans had there a fixed Place of Residence is sufficiently ascertained by numerous pieces of Roman bricks, earthen-ware, and Coins having been discovered there. In the year 1116, this Castle was besieged by Grufydd ab Rhys, who burned the outer Ward, and slew a great part of the Garrison; but, in consequence of the loss which he sustained thereby, he was obliged to raise the siege. In 1214. Rhys Fechan left this Castle well fortified, and with a good Garrison ; but, in his absence, it was surrendered without any opposition to an army of Welsh and Normans who threatened to invest it : according to Tradition, it was destroyed by the"], [314, "L L A forces of Oliver Cromwell. The Ruins of the Castle in its1 present State, consist of part of the Keep ; the site of the outer Ward, which is still visible ; and the intrenchments with which it was surrounded. But the site of the Castle is very remarkable, being an insulated Rock of some elevation, without any rising ground, or any thing of a rocky n ture near it. This Town was formerly a Contributary Borough to Caermarthen, but has been deprived of this Privilege, for a length of time. It, however, boasts of a Charter ; and a Bailiff is annually sworn : it has also a Recorder, Town Clerk, Aldermen, and Serjeants at Mace, though the offices seem at present to be little more than nominal. The Petty Sessions for the Upper Division of the Hundred of Perfedd are holden here by the County Magistrates. Here are no less than Five Benefit Societies ; three of which belong to Men, and two to Women : and they are stated to be of the greatest advantage to the Subscribers.

There is a strong Spring, near the Village, called Ffynnon Trillo. It is situate in the Valley of Edeyrnion, on the Banks ofthe river Dee: with the lofty and extensive Mountains of Berwyn immediately to the South. The Hundred of Edeyrnion is so called, from having been the Portion allotted to Edeym, one of the Sons of Cunedda Wledig, in the Fourth Century; when that Prince, with his Children, was expelled from his original Patrimony in Cumberland, and the neighbouring Districts.

There are several Tumuli, and ruins of ancient Fortifications, in this Parish : And a Lead mine has been worked from the remotest antiquity, but discon tinued at various times ; it was worked as late the year 1797, but is now deserted. The Foundations of a very ancient Chapel, called Llan Faelon,\\vere lately dug up in the middle of a Corn field, but nothing traditionary now remains respect ing it. The Prebend ofLIan Drindod is valued in the King's Books at \u00a35-8.. 9 ; and is in the Patronage of the Bishop of St. David's. Of the celebrated Springs here, it is proper concisely to mention, that the precise period when they were"], [316, "L L A first used for medicinal purposes cannot be ascertained. According to Dr. Linden, the earliest particulars recorded of them are, that they were thus used about the year I696, but at that time by the Inhabitants of the neighbourhood only. In the year 1726, they begun, however, to come into repute, and to be visited by persons at a distance : what contributed in a great measure to this, was the re-opening of the Saline Spring, which had been for some time neglected, and the discovery ofthe Sulphur Spring about the same period. The merit of these thino-s is attributed to the active exertions of Mrs. Jenkins, the Tenant's wife, whose name is, therefore, deservedly commemorated. These Waters con sist of three Springs, called The Rock or Chalybeate Water, \u2014 The Saline Water, \u2014 and The Sulphur Water. Several remarkable Cures have been effected by them. And what from the salubrity of the Air, and the virtues of these Springs, Llan Drindod now ranks high among the places of fashionable-resort.

A Farm-house, within a Field of the Church, called Nant Llan, is gen erally supposed to have been a Monastery : But there are no particular remains of it, to ascertain the truth of that supposition.

There is no Mineral Spring in this Parish; but it may not be unworthy of no tice, that there is a Spring, which ebbs and flows every day, the vulgar opinion says, \" with the Tide,\" with which, however, it appears to have no connection: I conceive it to be a mere natural Syphon in the bowels ofthe earth; which is not an uncommon Phenomenon. This Spring, or rather the Rill which issues from it, is called Nant y Rh) bo, signifying The bewitched Brook. The Country People, in the dark ages, ascribing every thing to Witchcraft, which they could not otherwise account for. This Spring was noticed by Giraldus Cam brensis, and his account is copied by various Tourists. Dinefwr Castle, long the residrnce of the Princes of South Wales, is situate in this Parish, not far from the Church. A few years ago, in levelling uneven ground in the Church yard, I discovered the foundations of some Roman Walls: And the'North- W^est corner of the Church is placed on the fragment of a Roman edifice. It is not improbal-le but the Church might have been built on the ruins of a Roman Temple. Two years ago, a pot of Roman silver coins was found in the Parish, within two or three hundred yards ofthe Church; a few of which are in my possession.\"\u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value o\u00a3,"], [322, "L L A this Benefice, arising from Augmentation, fixed Stipend, and Surplice fees, was \u00a352..3-0.

One or two Fairs were also holden here annually : but they have been so long disused, that the days whereon they were holden are not now remembered with certainty. This Parish contains 2437 computed acres ; of which, 780 acres are in Pasturage and Meadow, 400 are arable, 180 are Cop pice-wood, and 370 are Mountain. The Soil is various, some places being good, others indifferent, but all capable of impiovement and tillage: and the whole has been inclosed, for time immemorial, except the Coppice-wood and Moun tain. There are many excellent and powerful Chalybeate Springs, though but little noticed, which flowfrom the veins of Iron-ore and Coal that abound here, This Parish constitutes part of the Duchy of Lancaster, and its Inhabitants, as Tenants ofthe Crown, are Toll free in all the Markets and Fairs ofthe King dom, except the two Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. There are some very remarkable Caverns at a place, called Craig Dinberth, which are supposed by some Persons to have been Roman mine works, or those of the ancient Welsh before the art of blasting rocks with Gunpowder was known: Others suppose them natural Caverns, and some imagine that they were formed for the purpose of secreting persons and property during the ancient bloody feuds of the Principality ; Some remains of very old and clumsy oaken Chests have been discovered therein, quite rotten, and which, on being brought into the open air, soon mouldered into dust. These Caverns are entered by deep Shafts downwards.

It is nearly circular, being 68 yards in diameter, and composed of loose Stones, divided into three Compartments. It is encompassed by a low Rampart, constructed also of stone. A piece of Ground of about three acres, to the South West, seems to have had a Mound of Earth thrown up round it. and appears to have been an appendage to the Garn Wen. For whatever purpose it was erected, it must have been a place of great celebrity and strength, as the stone walls in its vicinity seem all to have been taken from the Agger. Query, might it not have been an ancient Court of Justice, such as was termed Grithhail by the Scots, and Parle or Parting Hill by the Irish ? The Hill to the West of it is called Cwen y Cwrt, i. e., The Court Hill, to this day. Above Llwyn Dafydd is a Fortress, known both by the Names of Castell Llwyn Dafydd, and Castell Caerwedros. It has two circumvallations, and is about 200 feet in diameter, being circular. The inner part has the appearance of a large Tumulus: the ditches are very deep, and the Mounds proportionally high. To the North, adjoining the outer Moat, is a small square piece of ground, fortified with a single work only. It seems too limited to have been a place of defence, but looks like the Barrow of a Chieftain, strongly moated round ; or the scene of Bardic Meetings. If a Castle, as commonly called, it must have been Caslill Mab Wynion, i. e., The Castle of the Sons of Wyneaon, being in the Cwmwd of Mab Wynion, and not of Caerwedros, which borders the river Teifi. Castle Mab Wynion was taken by Rhys ap Griffith, in 1164: and, in an arbitration between the Family of Rhys ap Griffith, this Castle was allotted to young Rhys.

Plds Gwyn was the residence of Paul Panton, Esq., a character distinguished, according to Mr. Owen, for his acquaintance with.the History and Antiquities of his native country ; and who left behind him a valuable Collection of Welsh Manuscripts ; but who was more particularly conspicuous for his liberality in aiding others, who pursued a similar track with himself.

The wooded part of the Island is on this side. It commences at Llan Idan, and recalls the ancient name of Anglesea, Ynys Dywyl, or, The Dark Island, on account of the deep shape of its groves : but at present it is (except in this part entirely divested of trees; and the climate so averse to their growth, that inmost parts it is with great difficulty the Gentry can raise a Plantation round their Houses.

The view up and down this magnificent river-like Strait is extremely fine. The shores are rocky; those on the opposite side covered with woods; and beyond soap a long range of Snowdonian Alps. Here stood a House built by Gwenllian, a descendant of Cadrod Hardd. The Mansion has been im proved, and altered to a castellated form, by the present owner. In the woods are some very remarkable Druidical Antiquities. Behind the House are to be\" seen two vast Cromlechs.

Not far from the Cromlech is a large Carnedd: part has been removed, and within was discovered a Cell about seven feet long, and three feet wide, covered at top with two flat stones, and lined on the sides with others. From Plds Newydd I continued my journey within sight of the water. At Craig y D dinas \\ was irresistably delayed by feasting my eyes with the fine view of the noble curvature of the Menai.

It is called by the Welsh Pwll Ceris, a name borrowed (it is likely) from the Roman Charibdis, such ano ther dangerous place as this, on the Coast of Sicily. The resistance the tides meet with from the numberless Rocks and Sand banks, together with the narrowness of the Channel, occasions great over-falls, violent Currents, and Whirlpools, while the Tide of Flood or Ebb makes strong, therefore must not be attempted but upon slack tides. The Tide coming Iron Caernarvon Bar, flows here sooner by an hour and a quarter than the North tide at Beaumaris, and makes an over fall at Carregy Pwll of about six feet, till it has flowed about two hours. The Tide from hence rushing with great violence as far as Penrhyn Saffras, near Beaumaris, meets the Northern flood, which conquers it by degrees; and about an hour and a quarter before it is high water at Beaumaris, the tide turns in The Swelly towards Caernarvon, which is the best time to pass : but this nick of time must be carefully observed by large ships, taking the advanta -e of a fair wind and a good Pilot. It is common for small Sloops to turn to windward among these Islands, when the wind is scant ; but it is not advisable for large vessels to attempt. At low water spring tides, there is not above seven or eight feet in the best channel.\"\u2014 Morris's Survey, p. 5. See, Llan Idan.

This Parish contains 1720 acres; of which, 61 acres are a Marsh, covered with water in Winter, and which might be in- closed at a trifling expense; it is a Common; 48 acres are Mountain, also a Common ; and 35 acres of Turbary : the rest are inclosed, and cultivated. Here is a small Well, called Ffynnon Elian, or, \u00abSf. Elian's Well, which was formerly in great repute ; the Water is tasteless, but good ; but it is not believed to possess any medicinal virtue. It is situate on the Irish Sea. The present most worthy Cur- ate very obligingly adds, \" The Chapel of Bod Ewryd has been detached from this Rectory, and erected into a Perpetual Curacy, for which Queen Anne's Bounty was procured. There stands within sour yards ofthe Church, a small Chapel which has been joined by a passage to the Chancel of the Church, forming an an- gle of four points with it, on the South side : it appears to have been built first as a Cloister for the Saint, and must have had a small Bell, as there is a place for one: it is called the Myfyr, or Place for Meditation. The Church of Llan Elian is a handsome Edifice, strongly built of grit-stone ; the corners of red free-stone, covered with lead, and supported by massy timbers of Oak. It has a Belfry, with a Spire, containing three Bells. It was formerly highly orna- mented with paintings ofthe portraits ofthe Saint, and the Apostles ; but they are now almost destroyed, except that ofthe Saint. In the East Window are some small remains of stained glass. In the Myfyr, or Cloister, before-men- tioned, there exists an old relick of superstition ; this is an oaken Box, fixed to the wall of the Myfyr, it is semicircular, about six feet long, three feet wide, and four feet high; with a door or hole a soot broad, and almost three feet high. During the Wake, all the People get into this Box : and should they get in and out with ease, having turned round in it three times, they will live out the year, but, otherwise, they assuredly die. It is pretended, that while some bulky Folks get in and out easily, other slender ones find the greatest difficulty, so that sometimes the Box must be removed from the Wall. In the Church is the Cuff Elian, a large Chest in form of a trunk, round on the top and studded with iron nails ; with an aperture to put in alms. All who bathed in the Well, made their offerings into the Cuff, otherwise they were not to hope for any benefit from it. The amount so received was formerly very great : People used to come from all the Counties of North Wales : It is opened only once a year, PP"], [334, "L L A namely, on St. Thomas's Day. The Church was built by Llan Elian, the Patron Saint, about the year 450 : he was denominated Cannaid, or, The Bright, and is our British Hilary: he was Son of Alltyd Rhedegog, The Swift, who was Grandson of Cadrod Callchfynydd, Earl of Dunstable. Caswallon Llaw Hir, The Long-armed, endowed the Church with many Privileges and Fran chises, and Lands that were holden in his name by the Freeholders : But the Saint has been deprived of all, except one Tenement of about ,\u00a320. per annum; and even the Rent of this Farm has been, for some years past, perverted, to ease the Parishioners of the Poor Rates, instead of expending it on the repairs of the Church : I have been assured by the old Parishioners that, when they were Wardens, the Rents were laid out on the repairs and ornamenting of the Church exclusively.\" \u2014 According to Mr. Morris, at Porth Elian the Liverpool Pilot boats lie afloat in eight Fathoms water, to be ready to meet any Vessel in the offing ; and not far from hence is the famous Parys Copper mine, the ore of which is shipped off at this Port.

His expenses in collecting m*iteriab, and for the Publication of The Myvy rian Archaiology, have been very heavy ; for in the course of the last four years, he has procured transcripts of all the works of the Poets from about the year 1300 to the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, wherein the works of each writer are separately classed. This Collection amounts (in I806) to Sixty quarto volumes of about 450 pages each, and is not yet completed. The Name of Myvyrian was affixed to this Work out of compliment to Mr. Jones, who was born at Tyddyn Tydyr, in the Parish of Llanfihangel Glyn y Myfyr, near Ceryg y Drudion, in the County of Denbigh.

This Parish is all well inclosed, and culti vated, and is about five miles in length, and four or five in breadth. In very ancient documents, this Parish was called Llanfihangel Tref y Caerau, or, Michael Church apud Castra, and was granted to the Church of Llandaff, by a British Prince, named Tydor, in the time of Gurvan, the Tenth Bishop of that See, and afterwards confirmed to his Successor Libian, who died in 929. The Rev. Henry Thomas Payne, of Llan Bedr, reflecting with great Judgment Ss2"], [360, "L L A upon this Name, was encouraged to make researches ; and fortunately, about ten years ago, discovered what he conceives to be decidedly the site of a Roman Station, at a place called Pentre Gaer; and in which Opinion he is supported, as well by local Tradition that it was anciently a great Town, as by the innu merable Fragments of Bricks, Pottery, and Cement, which are not only thickly strewed upon the surface, but intimately blended with the Soil itself. This worthy Gentleman had a regular Plan made of this Station by an ingenious Surveyor, Mr. David Davies, and which is carefully recorded in Mr. Theo philus Jones's History of the County of Brecknock, (vol. ii. part ii. p. 499 \u2014 500) : a Work of extraordinary Merit, and of Honour to the Principality ! \u2014 In a Field, about a quarter of a Mile from the Encampment to the South East, is a Stone noticed by the Hon. Daines Barrington to The Society of Antiquaries of London, on the 18th of November 1773, upon the communication of Mr. Maskelyne. It stood at a short distance from the Roman Road to Gaer, and now lies under a Hedge. Mr. Maskelyne did not give the Inscription accurately. The Name of this Parish is commonly, but, it is thought, erroneously written Cwm du, i. e., The Black Vale, which is by no means applicable to the appearance of the Country ; which is more open and of a wider extent than any other Parish in its Neighbourhood. The Indignation of the Natives is considerable, at what they deem a reproachful appellation, for say they, \" The Black Vale, is a Nick name, our's is a Fair Vale ;\" and so it is. It is, therefore, conceived to be strictly Cwm de, which implies The South Vale. Previously to the establishment of Breck nock as a County, in the reign of Henry the Eighth, it formed a part of the great Lordship Marcher of Ystrad Wy. Talgarth, which lies to the North, from hence, was called Ystrad Wy Uchaf or The Upper Ystrad Wy. Cwm de was called Ystrad Wy Isaf or The Lower Ystrad Wy. And the Inhabit ants of Talgarth would naturally call the latter, Cwm de or The South Vale, as it certainly was to them. The Farms in this Parish, except where they adjoin the Hill, are chiefly arable.

Upon the Carno Mountain in this Parish, a severe battle was fought between Roderic Molwynog, Prince of North Wales, and Ethelbald, King of Mercia, in the year 728 : two great heaps of stones or Carnau, are still remaining on the spot : one of these was opened by The Rev. Henry Thomas Payne, of Llan Bedr, in 1806, in which a Cistfaen was discovered, curiously constructed, but no de posit: the other appeared to have been previously opened.

The Vicarage is endowed with the small Tythes. This is a very extensive Parish, containing nearly 10,000 acres of Land. It is rather a singular circumstance, that the pre sent Curate is both Curate and Clerk ofthe Parish. As the Salary of the Clerk amounts to about \u00a3100. per annum, and the nomination being with the Vicar, the Father ofthe present Curate, he nominated his Son (The Rev. William Davies), who afterwards became Curate. He appoints a person to perform the common offices of a Clerk, for which he receives the fees ; but the Curate receives the bulk of the Salary, which arises from Easter Offerings.

The cheapness of Labour, of Provisions, and of Fuel, have lately attracted adventurers in the Cotton Manufacture, and caused them to erect stately Fabricks here.

Near the foot of the Bridge (according to Mr. Pennant), opposite to the Town, begins the ascent to Castell Dinas Bran, whose remains nearly cover the summit of a vast conoid Hill, steeply sloped on every side. The form is oblong : the Materials, the coarse stone of the country, with here and there a few free-stone moldings: The side, which is less steep, defended by deep trenches, cut through the solid rock. This was one of the primitive Welsh Castles. The Founder is unknown. It is supposed to take its Name from the mountain river Bran, that runs down its side. In the reign of Henry the Third, it was the retreat of Gryff) dd ap Madog. who traiterously siding with the English against his Countrymen, was obliged to secure himself in this aerial Fastness. On the death ofGryffydd, it came to the Warrens, from whom it passed by marriage to the Fitz Alans, and followed the succession ofthe Lords of Bromfield. The time of its Ruin is un- known. About a quarter of a mile higher up the vale than the Abbey of de Valle Crucis, is the remainder of a round Column, called the Pillar of Eliseg, perhaps one of the most ancient of any British inscribed Pillar now existing. It was entire till the Civil Wars in the reign of Charles the First, when it was thrown down and broken by some ignorant Fanatics ; who thought it had too much the appearance of a Cross, to be suffered to stand. It probably bore the Name of one ; for the Field, in which it lies, is still called Llwyn y Groes, or, The Grove of the Cross, from the Wood that surrounded it. It was erected at so early a period, that there is nothing marvellous, if we should perceive a tinctur.e of the old Idolatry, or at least of the prim\u00e6val customs of the Country, in the mode of it when perfect. The pillar had been a Sepulchral Cross ; and folly and superstition paid it the usual Honours. It was a memorial of the Yy"], [390, "L L A Dead; an improvement on the rude Columns of Druidical times, and cut into form, and surrounded with inscription ; It is among the first lettered stones that succeeded the Meini Hirion, Meini Gwyr, and Llechau. It stood on a great tumulus ; perhaps always environed with wood, according to the custom of the most ancient times, when standing Pillars were placed under every green Tree. It is said that the stone, when complete, was twelve feet high ; it is now re duced to six feet eight inches. The remainder of the capital is eighteen inches long.

Tradition says, that this School was founded in con sequence of a cure effected, by a Fountain, on one ofthe Vaughans of Derllys, called New Well, which springs near the site where the School now stands ; and that an application was made to the Archbishop of Canterbury to inclose that part of the Common, immediately adjoining the Well : this appears to carry with it a probability of truth, as upon a Stone over the entrance ofthe School room is engraven, \" This is a Charity School for ever, built at the Recommend \" ation ofthe Archbishop of Canterbury by the Lord, Freeholders and Inhab \" itanls ot' this Manor of Penrin, A.D. 1705-\" An Act of Parliament was obtained, about the year 1 806, for inclosing this Parish ; since which 5240 acres have been allotted and inclosed, and 836 acres of Common are about to be divided.

Previous to the formation ofthe Canal, where is a Wharf below the Church, the LlanGynydr hills afforded the principal supply of lime for the consumption of the Country. And indeed several Persons still carry on a considerable trade from thence on Horses' backs. At the extremity of the Parish, towards the County of Gla morgan, are the Union or Rhymny Iron works, carried on by Messrs. Crawshay and Co., under a Lease from The Duke of Beaufort : the River Rhymny, which passes by them, separates the Counties of Brecknock and Glamorgan: Tra dition still points out the Site of an ancient Castle, near the road leading from the Village of Llan Gynydr to Brecknock : but of its History we are ignorant, and it is thought to have been nothing more than a Lodge for a Forester or Woodward, belonging to the Lords of Tre'r Twr Castle. Upon the Hills in this Parish there are three or sour Carnau. The Inhabitants claim and exercise a right of holding Fairs, principally for the sale of Live stock, on the 4th of April, 20th of October, 7th of December, and on the Wednesday next before Christmas-day.

This Parish is about four miles in length, by three miles in breadth; and about two thirds are old inclosures: but an Act was obtained in the last Session of Parliament, to divide and inclose the whole Wastes ofthis Parish, in common with those of the neighbouring Parishes of Llan Fair Caer Einion, and part of Castle Caer Einion. Mathrafal, the ancient Seat of the Princes of Powys, after they had been expelled from Pengwem Bowys, or Shrewsbury, by the arms of Offa the Mercian, was situate in this Parish, on a little eminence, near the junc tion of the two branches of the Fyrnwy, at the Western extremity of the Valley of Meifod. The Site, and a few ruins of the Foundations are still visible. The burnt tiles had protuberances, in the form of the present slate pins, to fasten them upon the roof. The situation, within the angle of two rapid rivers, showed more precaution in the Founders, than the more ancient Britons were generally possessed of; who, most commonly, erected their Forts and Camps on inac cessible Rocks, never considering the necessity of Water for the supply of a Garrison. But notwithstanding the convenience of Water, both for use and defence, Mathrafal could never have been a place of safety for its occupiers; as it was immediately commanded by the gently rising grounds to the West. We hear very little of it in History, as the Princes, soon after its foundation, trans-"], [404, "L L A ferred their residence to the Castell Coch ym Mhywys, now Powys Castle, about five miles to the South ; a place much superior in every point. It is probable, however, that the subsequent Princes retained a predilection for the former seat of their Predecessors, as several of ths Dynasty of the Convyns, and one even from Winchester, came to be inhumed within the walls of the neighbouring Church of St. Mary's in Meifod. Two British encampments are still entire on the eminences to the West and North West, in view of each other ; which, with the Castle of Mathrafal, formed an equilateral triangle, a mile to each line. The Eisteddfod, or Triennial Assembly of the Bards, was holden at the Royal Palace of Mathrafal, in the reigns ofthe ancient Princes of Powys. LLAN HAMWLCII, v. LLAN AML LLECH.

It is 5 m. N. b. E. from Caern arvon. This Parish contains about 3000 acres of Land, generally inclosed, and cultivated. The Vicar has the third of the great Tythes. This Church was built in the year 616. Here is a Seat of Lord Boston's, finely situate on that arm of the Sea, commanding upwards a beautiful prospect of Caernarvon, and the Snowdon hills. The Church once belonged to the Convent of Bedd Celert: and, in I535, it followed the fate of that House. Queen Elizabeth granted it to Edmund Downam and Peter Ashton ; who sold it, in 1605, to Richard Prytherch, of Myfyrian, whose Daughter married a Llwyd, of Llugwy. On the extinction of that Family all their estates were bought by Lord Ux bridge, who left them to his Nephew Sir William Irby, the late Lord Boston. \u2014 \" In the Church is a Reliquary, made neither of gold nor silver, nor yet ornamented with precious stones; but of very ordinary Grit-stone, with a roof like cover. \u2014 I must not pass unnoticed the celebrated Stone, Maen Morddwyd, or, The Stone of the Thigh, now well secured in the wall of this Church. In old times it was so constant to one place, that, let it be carried ever so far, it would be sure of returning at night. Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, determined to subdue its loco-motive faculties, fastened it with iron chains to a far greater stone,"], [407, "L L A and flung it into the Sea : but, to the astonishment of all beholders, it was found the next morning in its usual place. I now enter on classical ground, and the pious seats of the ancient Druids; the sacred Groves, the Altars, and Monu mental Stones. At Tre'r Dryw, or, The Habitation of the Arch-Druid, I met with the mutilated remains described by Mr. Rowlands. His Bryn Gwyn, or Brein Gwyn, or Royal Tribunal, is a circular hollow of a Hundred and Eighty feet in diameter, surrounded by an immense agger of earth and stoneS, evidently brought from some other place, there not being any mark of their bein-r taken from the spot. It has only a single entrance. This is supposed to have been the grand Consistory of the Druidical Administration. Not far from it was one ofthe Gorseddau, now in a manner dispersed, but one consisted of a great copped heap of stones, on which sate aloft a Druid instructing the surrounding people. Here were also the Reliques of a circle of stones, with the Cromlech in the midst ; but all extremely imperfect. Two ofthe stones are very large ; one, which serves at present as part ofthe end of a house, is 12 f. 7 in. high, and 8 f. broad ; and another 11 f. high, and 23 f. in girth. Some lesser stones yet remain. This Circle, when complete, was one of the Temples of the Druids, in which their Religious rites were performed. It is the conjecture of Mr. Rowlands, that the whole of these remains were surrounded with a Circle of Oaks, and formed a deep and sacred Grove. Near this is Caer Lib, or, The moated Entrenchment; of a square form, with a double rampart, and broad ditch intervening, and a lesser on the outside. Within are Foundations of circular and of square Buildings. This Mr. Rowlands supposes to have been the Residence of the Arch-Druid, and to have given the name, Tre'r Dryw, to the Township in which it stands. At Tref Wry, I saw several faint traces of circles of stones, and other vestiges of buildings, all so dilapidated, or hid in weeds, as to become almost formless. Bod Drudan, or, The Habitation of the Druids, Tre'r Bardd, or, that of the Bard, and Bod Owyr, or, that of the Priests, are all of them Hamlets, nearly surrounding the seat ofthe chief Druid, com posing the essential part of his Suite. At the last I saw a thick Cromlech, rest ing on three stones. The shore near Porth Ami, not far from hence, is famed for being the place where Suetonius landed, and put an end in this Island to the Druid reign. His Infantry passed over (the Menai) in flat-bottom boats, perhaps, at the spot still called Pant yr Ysgraff, or, The Valley of Skiffs. His Horse crossed partly by fording, and partly by swimming. There are no traces of any Roman works left in this country. Their stay was so short, that they had not time 3 A 2"], [408, "L L A to form any thing permanent. At Bryn Gwydryn, behind Llan Idan, are two or three dikes and fosses of a semicircular form, each end of which terminates at a precipice, leaving an intervening area of no great space. Both from its figure and name, Caer Idris, I suspect it to be British. \u2014 I am sorry that it is not in my power to give a better account than the following of that Prodigy of Learning, The Rev. Henry Rowlands, Vicar of this Parish. His account ofthe Druidical antiquities ofthis part of the Island, and his comments on them, is a most extraordinary performance, considering that he never enjoyed any other literary advantages than what he sound in his native Isle. It is said that he never even travelled farther than Gonway ; but I believe it is certain, that Shrewsbury was the farthest limits of his travels. He died in 1723, aged 68, and was interred under a slab of black Anglesea marble, in the Parish of Llan Edwen. He was descended from Henry Rowlands, who died Bishop of Bangor in 1616, and who, in 1600, purchased from Robert Gryffydd, of Penrhyn, the estate of Plds Gwyn, in the fore-mentioned Parish, which remains to this day in his posterity. The inscription on his Tomb was of his own composing.\" \u2014 Pennant's Tour in Wales, vol. ii. p. 228. et seq.

This is probably a corruption of Celin, a Saint ofthe Sixth Century, for, in 1576, I find a Robert Vaughan, who describes himself in his Will to be of the Parish of St. Kellines, and desires to be buried at Llan Elieu, in which Parish part of his Estate lay; \u2014 from this request to be buried in Llan Elieu, it should seem, that the Church or Chapel of St. Celin's was either fallen or in ruins in his time. \u2014 At the extremity ofthis Parish Eastward, near the junction of the Counties of Brecon, Hereford, and Monmouth, is ano ther Chapel, now augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty, called Capely F/in, or, The Chapel of the Boundary; it was long doubted in what Parish this was situ ated, and even at this moment a great part, if not the whole of the Inhabitants of the Hamlet of Capel y Ffin pay their Tythes to Glasbury (in which Parish they say it is). In 1708, there was a long dispute in the Ecclesiastical Court about this Chapel : Lewis Thomas, clerk, vicar of Llanigon, refused to do duty here, as there was no Salary annexed to the Cure, whereupon he was cited to the Bishop's Court, at the promotion of some of the Parishioners, and in the Articles filed against him it is stated, that sometimes a corpse remained unin terred a whole night, and children died without being baptized, in consequence ofthe Vicar's neglect, though he had theretofore regularly officiated there by himself, or Curate, for ten or twelve years. In this cause many old witnesses were examined, two or three of them say the Chapel is in the Hamlet of Blan bwch, in the parish of Glasbury, others that it is in Llanigon, but all agree, that it is a Chapel of Ease to the latter; upon which it was decreed, that the Vicar of Llanigon should officiate there by himself or Curate.

M., of Dimland House, Chap lain to The Marquis of Bute, in the kindest manner adds, \" Lantwit Major, is a large, populous Village, or rather dilapidated Town, within a mile and a half of the Bristol Channel. It is situate in a pleasant, healthy Country upon strata of blue Lime-stone, covered by a rich clayey mould, and is surrounded by some of the finest Pasturage, and the best Tillage land in South Wales. The Church, a large Pile of Building, is, with few exceptions, the most ancient in Great Britain, having been built about the year 508. The Vicarage is of no great value, some of the Vicarial Tythes having been taken from it. Its 3B"], [414, "L L A Revenues were, however, once very considerable, and supported not only the Monastery with which it was connected, but also the establishment of a great Seminary of Learning. It appears from Tanner's Notitia, that Fitzhamon re- moved the Monastery ofLantwit to Tewkesbury, in the County of Gloucester, and that when that Abbey was dissolved, King Henry the Eighth annexed its Revenues to the See of Gloucester. Thus it happened, that the Impropriate Tythes of Lantwit belong to the Dean and Chapter of that Cathedral. Near this Place (and most probably at Boverton, a Village about a mile distant to the South East) was the Bovium of Antoninus, a Roman Station, through which the great Road, called the Julia Strata,- passed in the reign ofthe Emperor Vespa- sian. In this.Neighbourhood many Roman Coins have been discovered; and especially, on the 2d of November 1798, in a Field between Eglwys Brewis and St. Athan, by the Servants of Mr. William Davis-, while they were filling their Carts with earth, to convey it to an adjoining field for the purposes of Agriculture: they lay in the ground promiscuously, about 18 inches deep : and 30 ofthem, of fine silver, in high relief and excellent preservation, are now in my possession. A further proof of the Antiquity of Boverton is, that the King of the Country, according to the Liber Landavensis, resided and kept his Court there, in the latter end of the Fifth Century, before St. Illtyd first visited Britain : and though this Village is far inferior to Lantwit in extent and population, yet Boverton, in all ancient writings, has obtained the pre-em- inence, and gives a title to the Manor, which is stiled to this day in the Manorial Court Rolls, The Lordship of Boviarton and Lantwit. About a mile and a half from the Village of Boverton, by the sea shore, on the lofty cliffs com- manding the Bristol Channel, are two Roman Camps : one ofthem, upon the Eastern Cliff which defends one side of Colhugh Valley, is known by the name of The Castle Dilches : it is a strong situation, being accessible on one side only : the other encampment, about two miles from hence, is also upon the Sea-coast, and about the same distance from Boverton. That Lantwit received its name from St. Illtyd is universally admitted ; and that it continued to flourish many years after him, there can be no doubt. The many broad and direct Roads, leading towards Lantwit Major, and which like the Radii ofa Wheel terminate and concentrate there ; the numerous Streets and Lanes, which are still to be seen intersecting each other, like those of our largest Cities, and still retaining their ancient Names; the extraordinary size of its Church, and the Church yard surrounding it ; and the number of Human Skulls, which, from time to time,"], [415, "L L A have been dug up in the Gardens and Fields adjoining, when fresh Land has been broken up for the purposes of Tillage, prove it to have been a place of much consequence and of great population : and History and Tradition bear testimony to the fact. The Town -Hall still remains, where justice was for merly administered. The Gaol was demolished, only a very few years ago : but the name of The Gallows-way is still retained, in the Road where executions were usually conducted, and where skeletons have from time to time been discovered. It formerly traded with the Somersetshire Coast, and the Dialect of that County was prevalent here within the memory of man. For, near this place, is the ancient Port of Colhugh, formerly Colhow, where Vessels came in for protection in the reign of King Henry the Eighth. But so great are the changes which time has produced upon this Coast, that Colhugh is now avoided by Mariners as Sylla and Charybdis were by the Trojan Fleet. However, the ancient remains ofthe Harbour may yet be traced, although the Sea has made such vast encroachments here ; the foundation of the Pier and the piles of wood which formed its defence on the Western side, being still visible at low water. The Seminary at Lantwit flourished so much under the care and protection of Llan Illtyd, that Scholars flocked to him from every quarter, and most ofthe British Nobility and Sons of Foreign Princes received their educa tion here. His Pupils are said to have exceeded 2000 in number, who had Four Hundred Houses, and Seven Halls : and many of them made a figure in the world, but particularly Gildas, the Historian ; David, who removed the Epis copal See from Caerleon to St. David's, in the County of Pembroke ; Paulinus, or, Paul, Bishop of Leon, in Spain ; Samson, successor to St. David, and after wards Archbishop of Dol, in Britany ; Talhaiarn, a celebrated Bard and a dis tinguished Saint ; and also, the famous Taliesin, received their education here. The ruins and remains of the School-house are to be seen at this day in a Garden, on the North side ofthe Church-yard ; and the Monastery, Halls, and Buildings thereunto belonging, stood in a Field upon what is termed The Hill-Head, on the North side of the Tythe Barn. The Chantry House (now converted into a Barn) is situated in the Church-yard, nearly opposite to the Church Porch : and there are the remains of several ancient Buildings still vi sible in several parts of the Town. The ascent to the Town-Hall, which is still perfect, is by two flights of steps, and the room above is very spacious : the upper part is raised above the lower, like the Halls in our Universities ; and a Table ran from wall to wall, having seats all round, which were in good 3 B2"], [416, "L L A preservation a few years ago : over the Town-Hall is a Bell upon which the Clock strikes, said to have been presented to St. Illtyd by one of the Popes of Rome, and concerning which Holinshed in his Chronicles, vol. I. p. 131, has given us a superstitious story. The House belonging to the Rectorial Tythes, which were severed from this Monastery by Robert Fitzhamon, is still a re spectable Building, having hanging Gardens descending towards the Church : there are within several spacious rooms, which have usually been occupied by the Parish Schoolmaster, and are capable of containing several hundreds of persons. There are two Churches at Lantwit Major, contiguous to each other, being separated by the Belfry and Tower containing six harmonious Bells, which for sweetness of tone were scarcely ever surpassed. The most Western Building, or, Old Church, is said to have been deserted, on account of its damp situation : but, as the situation does not, upon examination, appear objectionable in this respect, the New Church must have been erected from some other cause. Below the Old Church is an ancient Building, called The Lady's Chapel, which is now almost entirely dilapidated. A Door opened into it from the Old Church, and there are some figures or busts of Saints still to be seen against the Walls, or, at least, the place where they stood ; for, a great part of the Walls have lately tumbled in, and I have not been within them for several years. The New Church contains three Aisles: it has a handsome Altar-piece, and is capable of holding a very large Congregation. The dimensions of these Build ings are, as follow : The Church and Chancel 98 feet long, and 53 ft. broad, including the two Aisles. The Old Church . . . 64^ long. The Lady's Chapel . . 4Qisong. The length of the three Buildings, adjoining each other . . . 203 feet. In Bishop Gibson's edition of Camden's Britannia, is a description of the two curious Monuments on the North side of the Church. There are also in the middle of the Old Church two curious Monumental stones, lying side by side and touching each other, and which, according to Tradition, were brought thither about the year 1730, by Mr. Thomas Morgan, who was Schoolmaster and Parish Clerk here at that time, from a place, called The Great House, where it is said a Church formerly stood. In the Vestry (a room behind the altar) there"], [417, "L L A is a gigantic figure of a Man, in the dress of Henry the Eighth's reign, with an English Inscription, impoiting it to be the Statue of Prince Richard Hopkins : it is of a whitish kind of free stone, like that which is dug near the river side at Bridgend, in this County : it is a laboured piece, and well finished, but is im perfect at the bottom ; of all these Monuments there is a further description, ac companied with plates, in the Archaeologia, vol. VI. p. 22- et. seq. Near Hopkins's Statue is the Bust of a Child, cut in high relief. And near the Altar is another rude figure of a person kneeling, and much in the same dress as Hopkins's : this figure has two small columns, one on each side of it, and just fits a niche, where seemingly was also a Bason for the Holy Water, but which is now covered over with Lime. In the Church-yard, on the South side of the Church, near the lower Door, is a stone which lies flat on the ground: this appears to have been part of an ancient Cross, its length being about six feet : it is also said to have been brought thither by Mr. Thomas Morgan, from The Great House : And is like wise described in the Archaeologia. Another stone rudely worked, but without any letters upon it, lies by the South Door of the Church, on the left hand side as you enter. It is about 4 feet long, and has four sides which are nearly parallel and of equal dimensions. I shall now conclude this account of the Antiquities of Lantwit Major, with a description of a very curious Monumental Cross hitherto unnoticed by any Antiquary ; it having been but lately disco vered, after lying for ages under ground. It was not visible when the learned Mr. Lhuyd wrote his continuation of Camden's Britannia, and, perhaps,. would have remained so to the end of time, had it not been for the exertions of Mr. Edward Williams (the self-taught Genius and Antiquary of Wales), who, led by Traditional History, undertook the arduous Task of raising this immense stone, which, with the help of twelve strong men, he accomplished ; taking up out of the ea;th, and erecting it against the Wall ofthe Church Porch, in the place where it originally stood, on the 30th of August 1793. But, it may not be improper to give his own account of this discovery, and of the circumstances which led to it, since it affords a proof, among many others, that Traditional History is not to be discredited when it contains nothing improbable, or that is not repugnant to common sense. \u2014 \" In the Summer of 1789, I dug out of the around iu Lantwit church- yard, a large Monumental stone. It is the Shaft of a Cross ; and its history affords a remarkable instance of the fidelity of popu lar Tradition. About forty years ago, one Richard Purten, then living at Lan maes juxta Lantwit, though only a Shoemaker, was more intelligent than most"], [418, "L L A of his class. He had read History more than| many, was something of an Antiquary, and had stored his memory with a number of interesting popular Traditions. I was then about twelve or fourteen years of Age, and, like him, fond of History and Antiquities. He one day showed me a spot on the East side ofthe Porch of the Old Church at Lantwit, where he said a large Monu- mental Stone lay buried in the ground, with an Inscription on it to the Memory of two Kings. The Tradition of the accident, which buried it in the ground, he gave, as follows. \u2014 Long before the memory of the oldest person he ever knew (for the knowledge of it was only Traditional), there was a young man at Lantwit, called Will the Giant. He, at seventeen years of age, was 7 feet 7 inches high : but, as is usual in premature and supernatural growth, he fell into a de- cline, of which, at that age, he died. He had expressed a desire to be buried near the Monumental Stone, which stood by the Church Porch : his wish was complied with : the grave was dug much larger than graves usually are, so that one end of it extended to the soot of the stone that was fixed in the ground.. Just as the Corpse had been laid in the ground, the stone gave way and fell into the grave. Some had a narrow escape for their lives. But, as the Stone was so large as not to be easily removed, it was left there covered over with earth. \u2014 After I had heard this Traditional account, I had a great desire to dig for this Stone, and many times endeavoured to engage the attention of several and their assistance, but my idea was always treated with ridicule. In the year 1789, being at work in Lantwit Church, and being one day unable to go on with my business (a Stone-cutter by trade) for want of assistance (it being the very height of Corn-harvest, and not a man to be found), I employed a great part ofthe day in digging in search of this stone, and sound it. I cleared away all the earth about it. Christopher Wilkins and the late Mr. David Jones (two very respectable Farmers) on seeing this stone, ordered their men to assist me ; and we, with great difficulty, got it out of the ground, and on it we sound the following Inscription: In nomine Di summi incipit crux Salvatoris qu\u00e6 preparavit Samsoni Apati si. e. Abbati) pro anima sua et pro anima Juthahelo rex et Artmali. Tegat crux me. Thus translated, In the Name of the Most High God the Cross of our Saviour begins, \u2014 which the Kino* has erected to the Memory of Sampson the Abbot and to Juthahel and Artmael for the sake of their Souls. May the Cross protect me.\" \u2014"], [419, "L L A N.B. It appears from the old Register at Landaff, that Juthahel, King of Gla morgan, and Artmael, King of Gwent (Monmouthshire), bestowed Lands and Privileges very liberally on the Churches of St. Illtyd. The Dimensions of this Stone are, as follow: Height, 9 feet. Breadth, 1 foot 7 inches at the top, and 2 feet 4 inches at tfie bottom. Thickness, 1 foot 3 inches. It is of durable silicious Freestone. It lay on the ground where it had been raised out ofthe Grave, till the 28th of August 1793, when I found assistance to erect it against the East side of the Church Porch, where it now stands. It must have been buried in the ground before the Continuator of Camden took a copy of the Inscriptions on St. Illtyd's Monument, ice, otherwise he would certainly have copied this also : as he would the old Stone, placed by Mr. Thomas Morgan before the Church door, had it then been there.\" \u2014 LLAN INA, in the Cwmwd of Mab Wynion, Cantref of Y Castell (now called the Hundred of Moeddyn), Co. of Cardigan, South Wales : a Chapel of Ease to the V. of Llan Arth, though part of the Hamlet pays a share ofthe expenses of Llan Llwchaiarn.

The Nanlle Lakes are two in number, and in the direction ofSnowdon; one of them is upwards of half a mile in length, and nearly a quarter of a mile in breadth ; the other is nearly half a mile in length, and the same in breadth ; being half a stone's throw distant from each other : the water from the Copper Works of Drwsycoed are said to have con siderably diminished the quantity of fish in them : but there are two smaller Lakes in the Mountain, called Llyn Cwm Silin, and Llyn Cwm Dylyn, that are more favourable for Anglers. A great quantity of Slate is quarried in this Par ish, and also in that part of the Parish of Llan Dwrog immediately adjacent, which are conveyed by Carts to, and exported from, Caernarvon. One side of this Parish being bounded by a chain of Mountains renders the Scenery ra ther romantic; and it is thought, that Snowdon, though no less than eight miles distant, appears to a greater advantage from the Parsonage House, than from any other place. Craig y D dinas, i. e., The City Rock, is a piece of ground of a circular form, about ?0 yards in diameter, rather steep on the side that is close to the river Llyfni, and on the other side run two mounds a few yards dis tant from each other, forming a ditch between them : that which is nearest to the Platform, is covered with stones, as if there had been some building, or that they had been intended for that purpose. The Tradition of the Parishioners is, that there was anciently a Town there, and that there is Money still undis covered on the spot; and that a Church once stood upon it. A stone fence now surrounds the green Area: and though the idea of its having been once a Town is the most prevalent, it is, however, thought to have been an old military posi tion. Michael Pritchard, the Poet, was born here about the year 1710, and died in 1731, in the twenty-second year of his age: several of his Works are preserved, which possess great merit.

The river Tanat washes its Western side, dividing it from the Parishes of Llanymlodfoel and Llansanfraid ; then joining the Fyrnwy, it bounds its South ern part, dividing it from the Parishes of Llansanfraid and Llandysilio. The Fyrnwy now becomes navigable for Barges of 40 or 50 tons burden in the Winter months. Great quantities of the Llangynog Slate have been sent from hence to Bristol ; and of late years, ores of Lead and Zinc, raised in this Parish, have been conveyed by the Stourport Canal, to Birmingham, Macclesfield, and other places. The river Morda divides it on the East from Kinnersley, and on the North it joins the Parish of Oswestry. The Townships of Llwyn Tydmon, and Treprenal, join with several neighbouring Parishes, in the House of Industry, Incorporated by the Act of the 31\u00b0 Geo. III. c. 24, and situate at Oswestry. The soil is of various qualities ; in the Upper part gravelly, and most friendly to Tillage ; in the Lower parts, loamy sand and clay, producing also excellent Pasturage. The Climate is favourable both to animal and veget able Life. The Montgomeryshire branch of the grand Canal passes through this Parish.

There are the Ruins of a Castle of a quadrangular form, situate on a Mount, with the remains of two ditches which formerly surrounded it. It is not known by whom this Edifice was erected, but I am induced to think, that the Mount was thrown up by' the Romans who had a Garrison here, as their Road, called the Julia Strata, passed through this Town ; And that the Castle was built by the first Lords Marchers, to whom this district was granted by the Crown. It was destroyed by Grufydd ab Rhys, Prince of South Wales, in 1 1 15. In the reign of Henry the Second it was granted to Hugh de Spenser, who must have repaired, if not built the present remains of the Castle. Roman Coins have been found here ; and on a Common, about three miles East of the Town, there are two small square encampments, evidently Roman, which are situate very near each other, and from their being raised on a Common, called Mynydd Cam Goch, it is probable that they were the hasty effort of some advanced Post to secure itself from surprise ; as it is evident, that a Battle was sought near this spot at a place, called at this day Cddley, or, The Field of Battle. An extensive Colliery is car ried on here by Messrs. Pengree and Co. ; the Coal is of excellent quality, and in the Summer there is a considerable trade in the River. Copper Works have lately been erected opposite to Lloughor, on the Caermarthenshire side of the River. Two hours before low Water, and the same time before high Water, the River is fordable from Lloughor to the opposite side. A Ferry-boat is kept here at the expense of Lord Cawdor, the Lord of the Manor, for the conve nience of Travellers.

Some ofthe Inhabitants of Maen Clochog thinking that there was treasure concealed under it, bored a hole in it, and had it split with gunpowder, and then dug up the small stones ; but to their great disappointment they sound no treasure.

Above Mall draeth lies the extensive (hithertofore) Common, called Cors Degai, bounded on the North West by the Parishes of Llan Gadwaladyr, Tref Draeth, and Llan Gristiolus ; on the North East by Llan Gefni and Llan Ffinan ; and on the South East by Llanfihangel ys Ceifiog, Llan Idan, Llan Gaffo, Llan Geinwen, and Newborough. About twenty-two years ago, an Act of Parliament was obtained to embank Malldraeth and Cors Degai, whereby upwards of 3000 acres of as good Land as any in Wales would have been secured to the Proprietors, who, when the whole ofthe Sea embankment, which is upwards of three quarters of a mile in length, had been completed, excepting two insignificant Breaches which might have been completed for about \u00a3400, most unaccountably left it unfinished. About seven hundred yards of the South East end of the Embank ment are at this day (excepting the trifling damage done by the back water) in as good, if not a better state, owing to the accumulation of Sand, than when the work was left off. To show what might have been expected from the Comple tion of this Work, The Earl of Uxbridge, Holland Griffith, Esq., and some few other Proprietors ofthe Upper part of Cors Degai, have inclosed their Allot ments, and in their present state lett their Parks for \u00a3l. per acre, although, for want ofthe embankment, Cattle cannot remain in them later than from May to September. It is reported, that the Proprietors have it in contemplation once more to take the work in hand, which for their own sakes and the good ofthe County in general, it is greatly to be wished that they will do. This Cors or Marsh is spelled in various ways, some making it Cors y ddau cae, i. e., The Marsh of two Fields, but there is no ground for such a definition. Others again, Cors ddu cae, i. e., The black, deceitful (quaggy) Marsh. But Tegai, the Founder of Llan Degai near Bangor, built himself a Cell in this Marsh, the Foundation of which (below Llan Gristiolus) is still visible, and it is now called Mynwenty Llwyn, i. e., The Church-yard of the Grove; and so the whole Marsh most prob ably was from him called Cors Degai, or, Tegai's Marsh.

There is likewise here a pon derous ruddy Spar, in great plenty (at a place, called Llan Ginwen) whose spe cific gravity is 4-25, and which no doubt contains some metal. The principal commodities of the Island of Anglesea are Corn and Cattle. Mr. Robertson, in his Map of Commerce, published about 200 years ago, says, Anglesea sent to the English market about 3000 head of Cattle yearly. But the Island is so much improved in husbandry since his time, that they amount now to 20,000 ; besidts at least 10,000 Hogs, and a great number of Sheep: After the annual Fairs are over, it is computed the Stock of Cattle on the Island is at least 40,000.

This Parish contains 7 87 acres of inclosed Land. Here is a Mineral Spring, which is stated to have effectually cured an infinite number of persons afflicted with The King's Evil. There is an ancient Cromlech, called The Old Church; and which, according to tradition, was an ciently the place of Worship belonging to the Village; and in the neighbour hood are curious and interesting specimens of Antiquity, especially a Monastic ruin. The Castle is demolished. The name is probably a corruption of Mor Croes, i. e., The Cross on the Sea Shore, from its situation near the Bristol Channel.

The Money raised by the Parish"], [483, "MAR Rates, in 1803, was \u00a3780.. 19-9, at lo*, in the pound. It is 9 m. W. N. W. from Bridgend. Margam is not a Market Town, but since the establishment of Copper Works, a Saturday Market is now holden adjacent to them. There is a Post-office here. This Parish contains 11,200 acres of Land; of which, 3200 acres are good Land, 48OO acres are poor and sterile, and 3200 acres are uninclosed Mountain, and Warren on the Bristol Channel. It is situate very pleasingly under the shelter of a lofty Hill and luxuriant Woods. The pre- . .... \u00ab sent amiable and intelligent Minister, The Rev, John Hunt, LL.D., most kindly adds, \" The Name of this Parish has for many Centuries been spelled Margam, a corruption ofthe ancient British Name Margan, or, Mawrgan, now pronounced Morgan, signifying The Great Head or Chief, in old English Gros test, and according to the oldest British a transposition of the word Can-Mor, a Name -riven f0 Malcolm the third Kino; of Scotland. Previous to the Thir teenth Century, this Parish was called Pen Ddr, meaning The Oak Summit or Mountain, a Name very expressive of the present Scenery. The Church being dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the Name also of the Parish has been fancifully derived from that circumstance, from Mair Gwm, or, Mary's Valley or Coombe. There are vestiges of a ruined Chapel in the Hamlet of Hafod y Porth : of one, in the Hamlet of Trisaint; and another, in that part of Margam Wood, called Craig y Cappel, on an eminence above the present Church. This is supposed to have been either the Parish Church in the time of the Abbey, to accommo date the Dwellers on the Mountains, or a Private Oratory appertaining to it. The latter appears to be the most probable conjecture. The Abbey of Pen Ddr was sounded by Robert Earl of Gloucester, A. D. 1 147., and assumed the appellation of Margam from Mawrgan the Son ofCaradoc, in the year 1200 or thereabout ; who, with his Brothers Cadwallon and Meriedoc, confirmed by Charter their Father's Benefactions to the Abbey. A Mile from the Abbey was a Convent of Nuns, called Eglwys Nunyd, or, The Nun's Church, now a Farm House : Of this Foundation no record exists, but stories are still prevalent of subterraneous connections between the Houses. Previous to the Foundation ofthe Cistercian Abbey by Earl Robert, we can trace no memorials; And as the Earl was dispossessed of his English estates by King Stephen for his adhe rence to the claim of his half Sister the Empress Matilda, I conceive that, at his death at Gloucester on the 31st of October 1147, he gave his Sanction and Patronage to the establishment, and endowed it with this extensive Parish and other Property, being then part of vast Domains which he became possessed of"], [484, "MAR by his Marriage with Maud the daughter and heiress of Robert Fitz-Hamon, the Norman Chieftain ofthe County of Glamorgan. By the same right he be- came Lord of the Castle and Township of Cynfig, which adjoins Margam, and was bequeathed to the Abbey with it; also of Caerdiff Castle, which he gave to his son William, as it appears that this Earl with his Countess Hawiscawere taken prisoners, in the year 1 158, by the Welsh in this Fortress. Toward the conclusion of this Century, Caradoc, by a nuncupative Will, bequeathed large possessions to the Abbey, which his Sons Mawrgan, Cadwallon, and Meriedoc, confirmed by Charter (sans date) addressed, \" Ordini Cistercienci et Fratri Mei- lero et Fratribus de Penddr.\" But in a Grant of Lands, bestowed on the Abbey in 1349 by Sir John D'Abene, a Descendant in the Fifth Generation from Cara- doc, it is therein termed the Abbey of Margam. In the Second volume, p 37, of Mr. Stevens's Additions to Sir William Dugdale's Monasticon, he speaks of Pendar as a Cistercian Monastery in Wales, the Site of which no Writer or Monastical History has discovered ; but states, that in the Charter of Margam granted by Mawrgan and his Brothers, this Monastery is denominated Pendar, and, therefore, identified it with Margam. I conjecture then, that the Abbey derived its appellation from the Name ofthe Person who granted the Charter, though Caradoc's Name had the better claim, and that when it was first appro- priated to the Abbey, the Ghurch and the Houses clustered round it. I am the more confirmed in this surmise, because the Inhabitants of this Parish, even now, when they speak of Margam, mean to denote what is comprehended in the Abbey Demesne, though it is the general Name of the whole Parish. To perpetuate our Names may be deemed a natural and laudable impulse of the Human mind, and such, perhaps, was Mawrgan's; and such seems to have been that of Hugo le Despenser, though with less success, who confirming to this Abbey the Grant of various Lands, given by his ancestors the de Clares, Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, addresses his Grant in two instances \" Mo- nachis de Clareval de foundacione Abbia de Margam.\" But, though Margam has supplanted the Name of Pendar, Clareval did not supplant Margam. The ap- pellation of Pen Ddr, i. e., The OakSummit, is now totally forgotten, but is cer tainly veiy appropriate to the great feature of this large Parish, as the Wood which rises immediately from the Church and a line parallel with it, presents a magnificent object to the Country and a conspicuous Landmark to the Bristol Channel. It covers the breast of a Mountain 800 feet in height, more than a Mile in circumference, and in Grandeur is supposed to stand unrivalled,"], [485, "MAR Upon a rough Valuation lately made os the Oak Timber which it contains, the Estimate was \u00a360,000. This Wood was, in the ancient Grants, denominated Cryke Wood, \" Totum ilium Boscum vocatum Cryke Wodde,\" a corruption of Craig. The Farm now cultivated behind its Summit, retains the Name of Craig Wyllt, which means The Ridge of the Rock. At the Dissolution of the Abbey its Property, consisting of this Parish, the Contributary Borough and Township of Cynfig, with a great extent of Lands and Impropriate rights, was rated, 26\u00b0 Hen. VIII., at \u00a3181-7-4 per annum, according to Dugdale, and \u00a3188-14-0 according to Speed. But, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal, dated the 5th of August, 35\u00b0 Hen. VIII., it was valued by the Commissioners at \u00a340-12-11, and sold to Sir Rice Mansel, Knt., for \u00a3642-9.. 8. And, on the 11th of December, 4\u00b0 and 5* of Philip and Mary, a remaining part was sold to the said Sir Rice Mansel, for \u00a3223-15-3; valuation not recorded, perhaps comprehended in the first. Sir Rice Mansel, Knt, possessed a Castellated Mansion on the North West side of Oxwich Bay, in the Hundred of Gower, in this County. His Ancestor Sir Hugh Mansel married the Sister and Heiress of Sir John Penrice, Knt., of Penrice Castle, on the opposite side of the Bay, and by that connection acquired great property contiguous to his own. But the purchase of Margam inducing Sir Rice Mansel to reside there, as a richer Country and more commodious Situation, his Castles in Gower became dila pidated, but even now exhibit proud remains of ancient Grandeur. A modern House, built on an elegant but small scale, at the foot of the Castle of Penrice, by the present possessor of the Margam estate, is now and has been the Resi dence ofthe Talbot Family (the Heirs by the maternal Line of the Mansels) for the last thirty years. The old Mansion at Margam, which was attached to and included part of the Abbey, was pulled down about the year 1780, but the Monastic remains, which consisted chiefly of Cloisters containing an Angle of a Quadrangle, were preserved. These conduct you to, the Grand entrance of a Chapter House, a duodecagon fifty feet in diameter, which has ever been considered a most elegant Gothic structure. On the 17th of January 1799, this interesting Building [from neglect) became a ruin. The Stones were inarched in the Copartments between the elliptic branching ribs ofthe Dome, by the percolation of the Rain first fell ; two of the ribs soon followed ; this producing an unequal bearing on the Centre column, after some months, forced out the third stone from its base, when the whole Roof instantly collapsed and left the side Walls, presenting only the spring of the Arches and the lament* 3 L"], [486, "MAR able reflection os its departed Beauty. Further particulars on this Subject may be known, on a reference to the First Volume, p. 15 1, of Giraldus Cambrensis, by that elegant Awitiquary and Scholar, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, who has favoured the World with a Print of this Building, and many interesting cir cumstances respecting the Abbey. The Parish Church, which is the Western half of what existed in the Monastic times taken off at the Transept, is still a very spacious Edifice ; but becoming ruinous, is now restoring in the stile of the Western front, a chaste and beautiful specimen of Norman Architecture. By the pious Munificence of Mr. Talbot, the repairs will soon be completed. In restoring the North Aisle to its original width, the old Foundation was dis covered, and many Gravestones with ornamented Crosses have been brought to light and preserved : but the most curious and perfect is a Stone 6 feet by 1 foot 8 inches in the middle width, inscribed to the Memory of an Abbot, sans date, with two lines of Latin verses, one on each side, in the Monkish jingle of the times : Amen, crossways at the foot, and a Crosier the full length of the stone very clearly engraven in the centre. The Lines are \" Constans et certus jacet hie Ryewallis opertus Abbas Robertus, cujus Deus esto misertus.\" This Abbot must have presided here subsequent to the year 1359, as to that date we have an account of their Names. The word Ryewallis, I conceived at first to be the ancient Welsh Name Rhiwallon latinized for the sake of the metre, Goronw ap Rhiwallon being a Witness to Mawrgan's Charter ; but I have since conjectured, that as the Monks here were chiefly Normans, and as the Monas tery of Ryevallis, in the County of York, was a branch of Clairvalle in Nor mandy, that this Robert Ryevallis was translated from that Foundation to the Abbot's Seat at Margam. In the Rerum Anglicarum Script. Vet. Tom. 1. Chronica de Mailros. p. 165 \u2014 6, vide, Ryevallis. It is sufficiently evident from the Annales de Margam, published by Mr. Gale, commencing in the year 1147 and ending in 1232, that the Welsh, jealous of the intrusion of Foreigners and of their possession of the richest part of their Country, were continually despoiling the property of the Abbey, descending from the back settlements in their Mountains, driving off the Flocks and Herds, and murdering their do mestics. This, I think, would not have been the case, if the Natives had been permitted to have become Members and participate in the good things of the Fraternity. These reasons lead me to suppose, that this Robert was a Norman"], [487, "MAR from Ryevallis, and not a Rhiwallon a Native of this Country, for as far as we can trace the Abbots' Names they are not of ancient British origin or spelling. A Figure the size of life, we have also introduced to the World, but mutilated, the Legs being broken, and the Head lost. It represents a Knight in chain armour, curiously wrought, with a Shield attached, but no Device on it discoverable. The Thighs are crossed in rather a forced and unnatural atti tude. I apprehend that this denotes the old Warrior to have been a Crusader. A Pillar at the East side ofthe Church-yard at the head of a Grave, now sunk in the earth so that its capital only appears, seems to afford a subject of curious research ; for being opened down, many lines in an ancient but clear Character are to be traced, of which, a few years since, that correct Artist and Antiquary, Mr. John Carter, F. S. A., took a Fac-simile, but which he has not yet been able to decypher. There are two Roman Monuments in this Parish ; one, near Eglwys Nunydd, on the High Road from Margam to Cynfig, inscribed on the edge of a square stone 5 feet high, and 1 in diameter, in very legible Characters, Pompeius Carantorius : This Stone is not in its original situation. The other, on Margam Mountain, has the following Inscription, Bodovicus hie jacet, filius Catotis, Irni pronepos, etemali in Domau. \u2014 I must now make a transition to Times less ancient, and introduce an extract from a Manuscript in the Library of His Grace The Duke of Beaufort, at Badminton; which records a Tour of The Duke of Beaufort through South Wales, in the year 1684, and his re ception by Sir Edward Mansel at Margam, on the 16th of August. To pass over the usual Welcomes of Welsh Hospitality, it may not be uninteresting to relate that, amidst other entertainments with which His Grace was amused, a Diversion, at that time in request, and very characteristic of the active energy of the Cambrian, was exhibited, of Deer Hunting in the Park by Footmen, who ran down two Bucks, and led them alive to the Antecourt of the House to be viewed by the Keeper and Party, and if judged sit for the Table, to receive the fatal stroke from a Scymitar. A Summer House, built on an intrenched Hill, called Peny Castell, commands a view of this extensive Park, and was a well selected spot for observing the sport. The Manuscript, from which this ex tract is taken, is so very particular and circumstantial in its Narrative, that, as it makes no mention of The Orangery since so celebrated, there is great reason to suppose, that so handsome and singular an appendage to a Gentleman's Seat, so far from being omitted, would have claimed peculiar Attention, and if it did exist at that time would have been recorded in these Annals. No note has 3L 2"], [488, "MAR been made by the Family os its first introduction, but, if we believe oral Tra dition respecting it, and we hive no other, it originated from a Shipwreck on this Coast. This Vessel was conveying from Portugal to Queen Mary, a pre sent from a Dutch Merchant of Orange and Lemon Trees. Being stranded, the Plants were secured and cultivated in a House 150 feet in length, with stoves, and a handsome Pavilion in the Center. Whether they were not claimed, or by any means compensated for, we do not know, but Sir Thomas Mansell, Bart , who was Comptroller of the Household to Queen Anne, and afterwards, in 17 11, raised to the Peerage, made an annual present of Fruit to Her Majesty. Whether this was to be considered a Quit Rent for the grant of former possession, or a grateful Compliment for the Honours conferred upon him, it is impossible to decide. The present Possessor, in the year 1787, built a new Green-house in a most superb style, 327 feet in length, with a handsome Doric front, and a Pavillion at each end, and, in the year 1800, a Conservatory, with Flues in the ground, I50 feet long. The Trees in the Green-house are all standards, planted in square boxes, and are remarkable for their round branching heads. They are in Number about One Hundred and ten, and many ofthem are 18 feet high. There are about Forty in the Conserva tory, planted in the natural earth, and traced against a Trellis framing, where the Fruit abounds, and attains its native size and excellence. The Collection consists of the Seville, China Cedra, Pomegranate, Curled-leaved and Nutmeg Orange, Lemons, Burgamots, Citrons, and Shadocks. The Pleasure Ground, surrounding these Orangeries, is peculiarly favourable to the growth of Ever greens ; amongst these a Bay Tree, or rather a Bay Bush, derived from one Root, but sprouting from the ground in various branches, is the most conspi cuous, being 56 feet high, and 45 in diameter, and still vigorously growing. The Arbutes are innumerable, and with the Portugal Laurel and Holly, exhi bit the most luxuriant Vegetation. \u2014 A Copper Mine, on the most extensive Plan of any in the Principality, established here by The English Copper Com pany, has been working about 35 years : it consumes daily seven Weighs or Seventy Tons of Coal, with which this Parish abounds, and by possessing a com modious Harbour at the influx of the Afon into the Severn, it commands a great Facility of Exportation. These Mines, worked by Level, promise an immense Source of Wealth, and if ever exhausted, the power of the Steam Engine will produce another supply from more valuable Veins in the Moors, which con sist of 1000 acres at various times reclaimed from the Sea by the Abbey, and"], [489, "M A R the subsequent Proprietors of their Property. Iron Ore is also in many parts dscoverable, and may hereafter tempt an Adventurer. Limestone abounds in the Neighbourhood. The Calculation I have made on the average of Mar riages, Christenings, and Burials annually for these last twenty years, is, Marriages 14 Baptisms 50 Burials 28. The Rateable Valuation of the Parish is \u00a31643.-6-8. Two Friendly Societies are established in this Parish; that of the Men consistingof I42, and that ofthe women of 81 Members. The Return made to Government, in I804, ofthe Live and Dead Stock, which, as the Farmers conceived it to be rather a measure of future Finance than Indemnification against the hazards of Invasion, does cer tainly not exceed the real possession, then valued at \u00a340,000.\" \u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Stipend from the Margam Estate, was \u00a340.

This is only called a Village, but it has undergone great improvements of late. About ten years ago a Market was established on Friday, and three Fairs annually, viz., on the 20th of January, the last Tuesday in April, and the 22d of September. The sum of \u00a33. per annum was left about a Century ago, for educating twelve poor Children. This Parish is nine miles in length, and four miles in breadth : part of it was inclosed under an Act, which passed in 1787-: and sour of the Townships are now in- closing by the consent ofthe Freeholders therein. Here are two mineral Springs, which are found efficacious in cutaneous and scrofulous disorders. The pre- sent Church, dedicated to St. Mary, according to Caradoc the Historian, was sounded about the year 1153. It was apparently built from the materials of two former Churches, part of whose foundations are still visible in the present Church-yard, an inclosure of about five acres. One was dedicated to St. Gwydd farch, an Anchorite in the earliest ages of Christianity, and who is represented in the Genealogies of Saints, as the son of Amalarus, a Prince of Poland : the spot of his retirement at Meifod is still called Gwely Gwyddfarch, or, The Bed of Gwyddfarch, on a Rock bearing the name of Gallt yr Ancr, i. e., The Steep or Rock of the Anchorite. The second Church was dedicated to St. Tysilio, the Son of Brochwel, Prince of Powys, a Saint and Writer who flour- ished until about the middle ofthe Seventh Century: he wrote an Ecclesiastical History of Britain. The great Tythes, which are very considerable, belong to the Dean and Canons of Christ Church, Oxford. The usual Spelling of the Name of this Parish is Myfod, and according to the Welsh Orthography Meifod. Mai-fod may be translated, a Summer Habitation, and also, a low champaign Dwell ing: Meufod, a Place of Appropriation, or peculiar Possession: Ymwy-fod,"], [493, "MAE Mesopotamia, or between Rivers. In the Twelfth Century Cynddelw, a Native ofthe Parish, in one of his Poems, describes the present Church, then newly founded, as situate between two Rivers ; which in subsequent times were joined in one at the head ofthe Vale. The united stream is called Fyrnwy, which unites with the Severn, at Cymmerau, about 1 2 miles below, or East, of Meifod. Mr. Tho mas Pryce, of Llan Fyllin, a learned Antiquary about the middle of the Seven teenthCentury,in a Letter to Mr. Josiah Babington respecting Welsh Antiquities, says, that \" My sod had a stronger claim to have been the Mediolanum of the Ro mans, than Llan Fyllin, as asserted by Camden.\" He says, \" Besides the Parish Church now standing ; I myself have seen the ruins of two others. I have also seen the ruins of a Crefydd dy, or,Religious House. Several Pavements and Hearths have been dug up in the neighbouring Fields, one I know at a small distance from the Village ; and the Field is still called Maesy Porth, or, The Gateway Field. At a like distance is Pentre-go, the Smithfield of Mediolanum. It has also two Lanas (if Lana means a Brook), and the Italian Mediolanum (Milan) is watered by two Chan nels, the Ticinus and Adder.\" Meifod became the Dormitory of the Princes of Powys at an early period, but how many are buried there cannot be ascertained. Dr. Powell, in his Translation of Caradoc's History, mentions only two, Madoc ap Meredydd (an Ally of Henry the Second, and who died at Winchester in that Monarch's reign, but who, having re-built this Church, was brought hither for interment), and Gruffyd Maelor, his Son. The only relic of Monumental antiquity, is a silicious free-stone, at present lying flat in the Chancel, having a few years since been brought from a Corner ofthe Church, where it had been discovered under a Pew. It has some rude Sculptures in Basso-relievo, though too rude to be attributed to any of the Princes. By its bearing the figure of a large Sword, by some mistaken for a Cross, it may naturally be supposed to have belonged to a Crusader, who had escaped the Scimitar of the Saracens in Pales tine. Such antique Tombstones of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, bear ing the figure of a Sword, are frequently met with in many parts of Wales \u2014 MELIDEN, in the Cwmwd of Prestatyn, Cantref of Tegeingl (now called the Hundred of Prestatyn), Co. of Flint, North Wales: a Curacy, not in charge: The Treasurer ofthe Cathedral of St. Asaph, being the Proprietor of the Tythes, appoints the Curate.

It has a Custom-House, two Quays, and Storehouses. The Honourable Robert Fulk Greville, upon whose property, and after whose Plan, the Town is built, with a noble generosity and public spirit, has erected here, and endowed at his own expense, for the use of the Inhabitants, a very elegant Chapel, with a handsome Tower, which was consecrated on Friday the 14th of October, 1808, and dedicated to St. Catherine. This Gentleman has also built here one ofthe most commodious Inns in Wales; and was the means of procuring some Ships of War to be built at this Port ; three of which, the Nautilus Sloop of War, the Lavinia Frigate, and the Milford of 74 guns, were contracted for and laid down by a person of the name of Jacobs from London ; but he failing, Government undertook their completion. Here the Earl of Richmond, afterwards King Henry ; the Seventh, landed on his enter- prise against Richard the Third, on the 7th of August, 1485. This is the Station of the Packets between England and Waterford. According to Mr. Morris, Milford Haven is reckoned one of the most extensive and best Ports in His Majesty's Dominions ; consisting of Roads, Harbours and Creeks, that would, perhaps, contain all the Shipping in Europe : but many of the Harbours here, as well as in other ports on the Welsh Coasts, want repair ; and some notable improvements might be made in them. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, be- fore the Spanish Invasion, two Forts were begun at the entrance of Milford, one on each side, called Nangle and Dale Blockhouses, but were never finished. The situation of these Block-houses was very ill chosen, as they would annoy our Friends as well as our Foes ; for upon a Vessel being commanded to bring too, before she is well in the mouth of the Haven, or in safety, she may be driven on shore on the Rocks and lost, or miss the Harbour. A small Fort might be built on The Stack, and another on Sandy Haven Point, which would command the entrance of Milford Haven, without endangering our own Ship ping. The Stack Rock is always above water, and lies near the middle ofthe entrance ofthe Haven, between Nangle andY)d\\e.

This Parish is entire, as an Ecclesiastical concern ; but consists likewise of a Lordship, by grant of some Bishop of St. David's, which owes suit and ser vice to the Barony and Castle of Llan Hauaden, the ancient Residence of the Bishops of this Diocese : and which has been compounded for by an annual Payment in money. The Hundred is corruptly called Dungleddy, from the Welsh name of Dau Gleddau, meaning the two principal Rivers of this County so called, which constitute the fresh water of Milford Haven, and unite their streams at Piston Point, five miles below Haverford West. Henry Scourfield, Esq., claims the Patronage ofthis Benefice, which he and his Ancestors treated as an Impropriation from the time of the Restoration of Charles the Second, but made it presentative, a sew years ago, as a Rectory ; whereby it's ancient state is restored. I have said that New Moat took its denomination from an artificial mount, fenced with a deep ditch and surrounded with a strong earthen bank. These works may have been formed by the Flemings, who were planted in the County of Pembroke by Henry the Second, and who got by force, and kept possession of, two Hundreds, viz., Castle Martin and Rhos, together with a large proportion of Dau Gleddau. This Mount, however, stands within sour or five yards of the South-eastern rampart of the most extensive Roman Camp, that I ever observed in this Country. It is a square of 300 Yards, on a gentle declivity southward, except to the South East, where it is somewhat narrowed by deep rotten, swampy earth. It is disfigured by various Hedges, and small Inclosures, and cut near the Centre by the Highway, leading from Narberth to Fishguard. Several feet of the lofty northern Rampart have been dug up within my memory, fermented with dung and lime, and carted off to manure the adjacent Lands. Yet enough remains to trace without difficulty this, and the other three sides ofthe Camp.\" \u2014 NEWPORT, or, TREF DRAETH, in the Cwmwd of Is Nefer, Cantresof Cemaes (now called the Hundred of Cemaes), Co. of Pembroke, South Wales: a discharged R. valued in the King's Books at \u00a3l6: Patron, Thomas Lloyd, Esq. : Church ded. to St. Mary.

At the distance of a quarter of a mile, in a Field on the South side of the Village, there is a very remarkable stone, measuring in length 24 feet and in breadth 10 feet, erected on others about 6 feet high, and so constitutes a spacious Room : I judge it to be a Druidical Temple : it has a Mound raised round it, except in one place where you enter.

This Parish is sup posed to contain about 6000 acres of Land ; of which, about 150 acres are uncul tivated and uninclosed. \u2014 The present worthy Vicar, The Rev. Hugh Jones, in the most obliging manner adds, \" There is a Farm House, cr.lled Manachlog, i. e., The Monastery, in the Township of Northop, which stands on Watt's Dyke, though commonly called Offa's Dyke, and which probably tooks its Name from being a Grange, belonging to a Monastery, as there is no Tradition of its ever having been a Religious House. The Language spoken in this Parish generally is Welsh, excepting the Tract along the Sea Shore, where English is spoken."], [527, "NUR Lead Ore is found in the Township of Caer Failwch : and the two Leadbrooks doubtless derive their names from the old Smelting Hearths that lie a little below Leadbrook House, near the extremity of the Brook : here the Romans smelted the Lead Ore, which was obtained from Halkin Mountain and the Neighbourhood : a great quantity of Slags remained at this Hearth, 'till about thirty years ago, when it was re-smelted and produced several Tons of Lead : among the Slags were discovered several Roman Coins in good preservation ; and also an ancient pig of Lead. A vein of Coal lies under most part ofthe Parish, of which there are upwards of Twenty-five thousand Tons raised annu ally. About a mile North West from the Church, is the Site, surrounded by a Moat, of Llys Edwin. Edwin was Lord of Tegeingl, in the middle of the tenth Century, and one (the Twelfth) of the Fifteen Tribes of North Wales. Northop is commonly supposed to take its Name, from being Northward in respect of the Parish of Hope, called East, or Queen's Hope.\" \u2014 NORTON, in the Cwmwd of Dyffryn Teyfediad, Cantref Y Clawdd (now called the Hundred of Radnor), Co. of Radnor, South Wales: a discharged V. valued in the King's Books at \u00a35 : Patron, The King : Church ded. to St. Andrew.

OXWICH, in the Cwmwd of Gwyr, Cantref of Eginog (now called the Hun dred of Swansea), Co. of Glamorgan, South Wales : a discharged R., consolid ated with the R. of Nicholaston, and valued in the King's Books at \u00a39-9-2: Patron, Thomas Mansel Taibot, Esq. : Church ded. to St, Illtyd. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting ofthe Villages of Oxwich, and Slade) was 202. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a3l8..7-3, at 4s. 6d. in the pound. It is 13 m. S W. b. W. from Swansea. This Parish contains about 1000 acres of inclosed Land, and about 221 acres (Ox wich Borough andThe Marsh) uninclosed. It is situate on the Bristol Channel. Here are the remains of a large superb old Mansion house, called Oxwich Castle, which was built by SirRic e Mansel, about the reign of King Henry the Eighth :"], [529, "0 X w part of it is now converted into a large Farm-house: The remains of a beauti ful Banqueting Room are still to be seen, which is ascended by a flight of steps: the Windows are of large and handsome dimensions : about twelve Months a<*-*o \u2022O ' a great part ofthis Building fell in, and destroyed the Dairy belonging to the Farmer, with all its contents, but fortunately no further mischief was done. This Castle is not supposed to have been built for the purpose of defence; though a few yards distant, on the top of Oxwich Wood, are the remains of a Watch-tower, which appears to be of much stronger workmanship, and of a more ancient date ; it commands an extensive view of the beautiful Bay of Oxwich, and the neighbouring Country, which is well wooded. The Parsonage House was erected, about eighteen years ago, by Thomas Mansel Taibot, Esq., the Patron of the Living. It is a very commodious and complete Buildino-, fronting the Bay of Oxwich, from the shore of which it is only separated by a large Beach of Limestone Pebbles, driven by the Sea from the Quarries a little distance off, and thrown up at high water : this Beach increases every year, and now forms a complete Barrier against the Sea : there is also a stone wall, built as a fence to a small Field in front of the House, within the Beach. A fine Wood lies a few yards above the House, in some places reaching nearly to the water's edge, and a few of the trees apparently grow out ofthe bare rocks which they overhang. This Wood is but little affected by the Sea breeze, and the Trees are not checked in their growth, as they sometimes are near the Coast. This Wood extends nearly to the extremity of Oxwich Point, and forms the Western side of the Bay. There is sufficient depth of Water, between the two points of Oxwich and Pwll ddu, for Vessels of any burden : and several Ships lie here at times, waiting for wind and Tide, or in bad weather, as it is well sheltered. A great Trade is carried on here, as well as in other places along the Coast, for Limestone: several hundred Cargoes being shipped off for the Coast of Devon, in the Summer. The Vessels employed in this Trade are from thirty to eighty Tons burden. The People of the Country get a good livelihood by this means ; the Men dig the stones both in the winter and summer; and as the Vessels only trade in the Summer, they get together several Cargoes by the commencement ofthe Trade: the Men break the stones, after blowing the Rocks, to a size easy to be lifted up, the Women then, having a horse and little staked car, made for the purpose, convey the stones to the shipping places within low water mark : and, at high water, the Vessels moor themselves along side the heaps, which are known by poles being fixed in them, and there lie till the Tide begins to"], [530, "O Y S ebb, when they are thrown into the Vessels (by means of a temporary stage) by Men and Women, who receive a good hire from the Captains, with an allow ance of Beer. -The stones are sold by the digger ofthem at the rate of Is. per ton, or so much the Cargo ; there is also a duty of (2d., and in some places id. in each shilling, paid by the Captain to the Lord of the Manor, for the permission to di1* the stones. Oxwich Church is romanticly situated on the edge of the Wood, not far from the Sea shore, and from the Sands, is a very pleasing ob ject, appearing to be enveloped in the wood. Between the Church and the Sea, stand the Ruins of the old Parsonage House : the outer wall of which, still remaining, is built on the Rocks, and washed at high water in Spring tides by the Sea: which, latterly, seemed so much to threaten destruction to the House, that Mr. Taibot with great liberality built the present one. Tradition says, that the Sea destroyed Land and Houses, which formerly laid below the Church: this appears very likely, as the Church now stands at the Southern extremity of the Parsonage, and at some distance from the Villages of Oxwich and Slade: the Parsonage House is now the nearest to the Church. The Sands here are remarkably firm and smooth, and the water generally clear ; consequently it is an excellent place for Sea-bathing. Plenty of Crabs and Lobsters are caught here, and occasionally Oysters. The Sea weeds, known by the Names of Laver and Samphire, abound on these Rocks. The Laver is a broad and thin green Leaf, growing on the flat rocks or stones in the Sea ; it is gathered, and then boiled well, put into earthen pots with merely a little salt, and sent as \u00ab rarity to a great distance. The Samphire grows on the larger rocks or cliffs, not over flowed by the Sea ; when not in blossom it is gathered, boiled and pickled, and is an excellent substitute for Capers, and is much esteemed as a Pickle. Ac cording to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Tythe, Glebe, and Surplice fees, was \u00a3120-7- 11. The Rev. John Collins, Senr., is the present worthy Rector, and is resident. OYSTERMOUTH, anciently CAER TAWY, in the Cwmwd of Gwyr, Cantref of Eginog (now called the Hundred of Swansea), Co. of Glamorgan, South Wales : a Perpetual Curacy, not in charge, of the certified value of \u00a3l 0. : Patron, Rhys Davies, Esq., of Swansea, who is the Impropriator : Church ded. to All Saints. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 715. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a3132.13..10, at 5s. 6d. in the pound. It is 5 m. S W. b. S. from Swansea. Here is no Free School, but the Impropriator has for some time past kept a certain number of Boys at"], [531, "O Y S School at his own expense. This Parish contains about 3000 acres of inclosed Land, and 1000 acres uncultivated and uninclosed, being all Common Lands belonging to the Freeholders and Customary Holders. The Tythes and Advow- son originally belonged to the Warden and Chaplain of the Hospital at Swan- sea by Endowment from the Bishop of St. David's, in the reign of Edward the First ; but were dissolved in the reign of Edward the Sixth. From the en- croachments of the Manorial Lords upon this line of Country much confusion and tyranny prevailed till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when a Decree was made in Chancery in the cause of The Marquis of Worcester, one of the Lords of the Manor of Gwyr, Plaintiff, and Sir George Herbert and One Thou- sand Gentlemen and Freeholders and Customary Tenants, Defendants, in favour of the Defendants, establishing their Rights and thereby doing away all the vexatious and arbitrary claims. It is situate upon Swansea Bay, the Eastern extremity of the Parish being called, The Mumble Point. According to Mr. Morris, The Mumble Flats is a dry sheltered situation, with soft ground to lie on ; Vessels drawing eighteen feet water, may run in here at high water spring tides. There is a Light-House, lately erected, on the Mumble Head, which has proved an invaluable benefit to the traders in the Bristol Channel. Here might be made an excellent situation for shipping, if the Sounds between the Mumble Head and the Shore were walled up, or isa Pier of one Hundred yards was run out under the East point of Mumble Hill ; the expense of which would not exceed two thousand pounds, as there are plenty of materials at hand. To the East of the Mumble Church, on a knoll or little eminence, stands Oyster- mouth Castle, a considerable part of which now remains, and in better pre- servation than any of the Castles in Gower ; commanding a fine view of the Bay of Swansea, and the surrounding Country. Here, according to tradition, was formerly holden the Chancery Court for the Seigniory of Gower : it is now the property of His Grace The Duke of Beaufort, as Lord of the Seigniory ; and, in the summer, is resorted to by parties of pleasure, from Swansea and the Neighbourhood, who dine upon a Green within the Walls. The Gate-way is nearly perfect, and also a staircase leading to a Terrace. There are several Dungeons within the Castle, and in one of them is a circular stone pillar, into which each visitor sticks a pin, according to an old custom. A quarter of a mile nearer Swansea, on a small Stream, is a Mill for sawing and polishing Marble, lately erected by Messrs Wallace and Gubbins ;"], [532, "O Y S the Marble is brought from the Limestone Quarries at the Mumbles, and there manufactured into Tombstones and Chimney-pieces, Sec. A Rail-way has been carried, within the last three years, from Swansea to the Mumbles along the Sea shore ; by which Coals and Manure are brought down, and Limestone is taken back. A Car, upon Tram wheels, and carrying about 16 or 18 persons, goes and returns twice everyday, during the Summer, down to the Mumbles; each Passenger paying a Shilling fare : it is convenient for Sea-faring people and others, and the Proprietor amply repays himself; who has permission from the Rail-road Company to run this Car, upon paying a small sum annually. At the Quarries, near the Village of The Mumbles, several Lime Kilns, on an improved plan, have been erected by Messrs Yalden and Pemberton, which they ship off for the County of Devon ; and as Coals are procured at an easy and cheap rate, and no duty being paid for the Lime carried across the. Channel, they are enabled to sell their Lime to the Merchants in that County, cheaper than they can burn it themselves there, especially as the expense of carrying the Lime-stone and Coals, (for the latter of which they pay duty), is very g reat : this speculation is likely to prove both advantageous to the con sumers of Lime, and to the undertakers ofthe concern. In digging the stone in these Quarries, several Human bones of large size were discovered : Tradi tion says, that a Chapel formerly stood near this spot, but no vestiges of it are now to be seen: it is, nevertheless, not improbable but that there might have been one, as the Sea has made great encroachments on this part of Swansea Bay, and a large Wood, called Crows Wood, between Swansea and the Mumbles, which is mentioned in some ancient Records now preserved in the Corporation chest at Swansea, has been destroyed by the Sea ; evident vestiges whereof are now to be seen, such as large pieces and roots of Trees, and the sands being in termixed with a black Peat or muddy substance, which are in several places very loose and quick, and dangerous for a stranger to ride over. Several Wears, for catching Salmon, are erected on these sands within low water mark, and quan- tities of Fish caught in them, are taken to Swansea. The Village of The Mum- bles is, during the Summer, the resort of many persons from Swansea, fora few weeks ; where there are some neat comfortable Cottages, and where good Lodg\" ings may be procured ; but, in the Winter, this Village is most dreary, as the Sun scarcely shines upon it for three Months. The Vessels bound to Falmouth with Coals from Swansea, occasionally lie here, waiting for Wind and Convoy ;"], [533, "PAR and there are frequently one hundred and fifty sail of them at one time in the Mumble Road. An extensive Oyster Fishery is carried on here, from which circumstance it derives the Name of Oystermouth. According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value ofthis Benefice, arising from Augmentation, fixed Stipend, and Surplice Fees, was \u00a335.. 14..0. P.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 70. The Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, was \u00a360-13-2, at 3s. 3\\d. in the pound. It is 8 m. N. N. W. from Abergavenny. The Church stands upon a Knoll rising above a small Stream, called Nant Mair, or, Mary's Brook. St. Ishow' 's Well is at the bottom of the Hill, walled on three sides, but open in the front, and covered. In the Walls were recesses, which were, most probably, intended to receive the Presents made by pious Votaries. Hetewald, Bishop of Llandaff, consecrated a Church here in the Eleventh century, when 3R"], [534, "P E M it was called Merthur Issui, evidently a corruption of Merthyr Ishow, i. e., Ishow the Martyr. But the present Building is not older than the end ofthe Fifteenth Century. The present Name of the Parish seems to be a corruption of Parthau'r Ishow, i.e., The Regions or Country of Ishow. In the Church is a beautiful Rood-Loftand Screen, carved in Irish Oak, which, from the wyverns and union ofthe two Roses, appearing among the embellishments, is conceived to have been erected in the reign of King Henry the Seventh. The Font, hol lowed out of a single stone, is capacious, and of great antiquity, as appears from the Name of Gynhyllyn, inscribed upon the rim, in rude characters. This Gynhyllyn or Cynhyllyn was a British Lord of Ystrad Wy, about the reign of King Henry the First, and permitted to retain his property after the Con quest of the Country by Bernard de Newmarch. The Bridge of Pontyr Escob, or, The Bishop's Bridge, noticed by Sir Richard Hoare in his elegant illustra tions of Giraldus Cambrensis (vol. 1. p. 94), crosses the Grwyney Fawr, and connects this Parish with the opposite one of Cwmyoy, and the Forest of Mo) le, in the County of Monmouth ; and is repaired at the expense of these two Parishes.

Pembroke, which stands upon a Creek of Milford Haven, called Down Pool, in one of the most pleasant Parts of the Principality, is said to derive its name from the ancient British word Penfro, signifying a Cape or Promontory. It is the County Town, and, next to Caermarthen, is the largest and richest Town in South Wales. In the reign of King William Rufus, Arnulph de Montgomery, brother to the Earl of Shrewsbury, fortified it with Walls, and a magnificent Castle, which he built upon a Rock at the West end of the Town, in the Parish of St. Mary ; under which is a natural Cavern, called The Wogan, remarkable for its echo. This structure being burnt a few years after, wasre built by Owain, the Son of Cadwgan ab Bleddyn, a wild and dissolute Prince of Powys; and is remarkable for being the Birth-place of King Henry the Seventh, as also for the brave defence made by the Garrison for King Charles the First.

There are the vestiges of a Church, which formerly stood within one hundred yards of Pen Arth Castle, but about six or seven hundred acres adjacent are now covered with Sand, and the foundations of Houses are frequently dug up at the depth of several feet. The present Parish Church was built about half a mile to the Eastward of these ruins. A Town is supposed to have stood formerly where the Sands now are, as there is still a village to the South of them, called South Gate, and a Farm house to the North of them, called Norton or North Town. It is conjectured to take its Name, 'rom the jutting out of a part of the Parish into the Bristol Channel, something like the shape of a Bear's Head.

A little below the Castle, on the sands, is a Rock, called The Three Cliffs, from its resemblance to three Sugar loaves placed in a line. In the centre ofthis Reck is a curiously formed Arch, sufficiently large to admit a man to pass through: and in stormy wea ther the wind and sea raging against it, occasion a tremenduus noise some what like the blowing of immense Forge-bellows.

According to Mr. Morris, Red Wharf is a noted place for the Limestone Trade, which is carried on to all the neio-hbouring Counties, but as it lies open to the North West Wind, a small Pier, at Porth Llongdy, which might be made for about \u00a3400., would be of very great utility. At a place, called Twlly Wig, in this B.iy, there are large loose blocks of grey Marble, that have been thrown out of their beds by the Sea; one of which is 3 feet thick, 9 feet broad, and 27 feet long, containing 609 cubic feet; and as the specific gravity of this marble is 2.7, this stone must weioh above 47 tons. Near this place are noted Quarries of Mill-stone, ofthe o-rit kind, which are shipped off here. The Sand ofthis place is good manure. The Rev. Henry Rowlands, in his Mona Auliqua Restaurata, pp. 154 and 18J., informs us, that Gerinnius or Gerrint, who was Grandson of Constantine, Duke of Cornwal, the successor of King Arthur, being Admiral of the British fleet, anil having thereby sometimes occasion to harbour in the Isle of Anglesea, prob-bly caused the Church of Pen Traeth to be built, and then called Llan Fair Bettws Geraint. He is celebrated ina particular Ode, called Cywydd Ge raint ab Erbin, by Llywarch Hen. The little Chapel of Pen Traeth, according"], [556, "PEN to Mr. Grose (Supplement, vol 2.) is more remarkable for its simplicity, and the beauty of the rural scene by which it is surrounded, than for any mat ters of antiquity or curiosity in its construction, or contained within its walls ; it is, nevertheless, no very modern building, its form being that of the most ancient chapels in Wales. Among the other humble ornaments with which it is decorated within, are a number of paper garlands suspended from the roof; these, from the circumstance of their having each a pair of hands in the centre, seem intended to commemorate the Hymeneal unions of some of the Parishioners. Here are no funeral monuments older than the Sixteenth century.

It is the handsomest, and best built Town in the County of Radnor, situate on the banks ofthe river Lug, which is celebrated for its pleasant Trout and Grayling fishing. It is nearly surrounded by a fertile and well-cultivated Valley, and from an eminence, called War don, close to the Town, a most de lightful, confined View presents itself, and which is admired by all who have seen it. This is a very improving Town, there being at this Time (3d of July"], [563, "P R E 1810), though after so many years of War, scarcely a void House in it; and it is an Acknowledgement deservedly due to the original Settlers here, that there are very few Houses without a good Garden. This Parish is very extensive, being divided into several Townships, a great part thereof being in the County of Hereford: it can very justly boast of many capital and truly eligible Farms, and, excepting in one or two instances, not larger than they should be. Great abundance of Wheat is grown in the Parish, but the soil is more particularly adapted for Barley\\ The Rectory is very valuable, and is worth, at an easy cal culation, \u00a3]000. per annum. The Free School, for the Benefit of the Inhabitants of the Township of Presteigne, is well endowed, and was founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by John Beddoes, Esq., an eminent and worthy Clothier residing in the Town at that time. The Rev. John Grubb is the present ex cellent and amiable Master, and has enjoyed the situation almost Thirty years. The Great and Quarter Sessions are holden here, and the County Courts here and at New Radnor alternately. There is an excellent little Bowling Green in the Town, which contributes very much to the Sociability and Health of the Inhabitants. Near this Town is a Place, called The King's Turning, meaning, as is generally imagined, King Charles's Turning, there being in one ofthe old Registers of the Parish the following Note. \" In the time of Oliver Cromwell, Nicholas Taylor, Esq., lived at the Lower Heath in this Parish, and when King Charles the First fled before Oliver Cromwell, then in the Neighbourhood of Hereford, he dined and slept at the Unicorn Inn in Leominster the first day, and the next two Nights he slept at Mr. Taylor's (a short distance from the King's Turning); from thence he rode over the Hills to Newtown, and so on to Chester.\" At that time,The Rev. John Scull had the Living of Presteigne,but like many of his unfortunate Brethren, at that tumultuous period, was deprived of it, and an entry in Latin to that effect is made in another part of the same old Register. Over the great Chancel Window on a stone is inscribed M. P. L., 1244, which Letters are generally supposed to mean, Martin the Pope's Legate. This, however, appears to be an error, as Richard Marline, according to Browne Wilbs, in his Survey of the Cathedral Church of St. David's, p. 115, was conse crated on the 1st of July 1482 : he was an extraordinary Benefactor to the Town of Presteigne, for which he got great Privileges, and a Market. By a Lease from the Crown for 31 years from the 5th of April 1784, and which will expire on the 5th of April 1815, all Mines and Minerals within the Lordship of Can tref Maelienydd, were granted to The Honourable and Reverend Dr. John"], [564, "P R I Harley, at the Rent of 10s. per annum, and of the ores, Sec.

PRIESTHOLM, ISLAND, off the Cwmwd of Dindaethwy, Cantref of Rhosyr (now called the Hundred of Dindaethwy), Co. of Anglesea, North Wales ; in the Parish of Pen Mon. \u2014 \" About a mi^e from the shore is the little Island of Priestholm, St. Seiriol, or Glann Ach, which, perhaps, might have been the principal residence of the Religious (of Pen Mon), for the Priory goes under both names : usually they were called Canonici de insula Glann Ach. Prob ably part might reside on the Main-land, to look after their property, and others be engaged in acts of Devotion in their retirement. The only remains of their residence is a square Tower ; but abundance of Human bones scattered up and down, are strong proofs of its reputed Sanctity, and the superstitious wish of people to have this made the place of their interment. The first Recluses of this Island, according to Giraldus, were Hermits. The Channel, or, as it is called, The Sound, between the Main-land and Priestholm is very deep, and is the common Passage for ships to and from the road of Beaumaris. On the other side is the East Passage, which, at low water, is between the Island and the Point of Traeth Telafen, little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and naviga ble for only small Vessels. The Island is about a mile long, extremely lofty, and bounded by precipices, except on the side opposite to Pen Mon, and even there the ascent is very steep. The Land slopes greatly from the summit to the edge of the precipices. During part of Summer the whole swarms with Birds of Passage. The slope on the side is animated with the Puffin Auks. The Channel between Priestholm and Anglesea has produced some very un common Fish. The Smirnium Olusatrum, or Alexanders, almost covers the South-west end ofthe Island, and is greedily eaten (boiled) by Sailors who are just arrived from long Voyages. The Iris F\u0153tidissima, or Stinking Gladwin, is common about the square tower, and is frequently made into a poultice with oatmeal, and used by the country people with success in the Quincy.\" \u2014 Pen nant's Tour in Wales, vol. ii. p. 249, et seq.

It is , m.N.W. from Kington, and 156^ m. W.N.W. from London. The present most worthy and intelligent Rector of Cascob, The Rev. W. J. Rees, in the kindest ma nner, adds, ' It is situate on the river Somergill,2it the entrance of the pass from themoun- tainous part of the County to the fertile Vale of Radnor. Caradog informs us, that, about the year 990, Meredydd ab Owain destroyed the Town of Radnor in a ferocious contest which he had with his Nephew, who had been ravaging South Wales with the assistance of the English. There are still some remains of its Castle, and, about the year 1773, on digging on its site, six or seven small Gothic arches of good Masonry were discovered (which seem to have been built for the better support of the incumbent Wall), together with several an- cient instruments. The Intrenchments about the Castle are nearly entire : the outer Ward, called Baili Glas, or, The Green Court-yard, is still distinct from the inner one or Keep, and in its original form. The site ofthe Town Walls, with the Moat, are very visible, and particularly so on the West and South sides. The Walls, when standing, are traditionally reported to have been of considerable height The area of the Town inclosed by them was an oblong square, and in extent about 26 acres of ground. The Town at present is fallen 3X2"], [568, "RAD off very much from its former importance, consisting ofabout fifty houses, and several of these of mean appearance. Its decline was originally occasioned by the tranquillity of the times not requiting it to be kept fortified and garrisoned as a Frontier town ; its proximity to Presteigne and Kington ; and its cold situation, on account of its contiguity to the neighbouring Hills, together with a scarcity of Fuel. From the present appearance ofthe Town, it seems to have been originally regularly laid out, having three longitudinal Streets, called High Street, Broad Street, and Water Street, which were intersected by five transverse ones; of these several have no buildings, and some ofthem are only Foot-paths. The Town-hall, and Prison, are opposite to each other, and are situate in Broad Street. The Corporation consists of a Bailiff, twenty-five Capital Burgesses, two Aldermen, a Recorder, Coroner, Town Clerk, and other inferior Officers. The Bailiff and Aldermen are chosen annually out of the Capital Burgesses, and are Justices of the Peace : The Bailiff is also a Justice, for the year succeeding the one in which he was in Office : three more per- sons are also annually nominated out of the Capital Burgesses to assist the Bai- liff and Afdermen, and have the authority of Justices. The district over which they preside, and supersede the authority of the County Magistrates, is con- siderable ; comprehending between four and five miles in every direction from the Town, and is called, The Corporation or Borough of Radnor. The Bailiff's Courts, and Petty Sessions, are regularly holden every Monday, when the Bailiff, Aldermen, and Town Clerk, attend to transact business relat- ing to the Borough, and have power to determine all suits, whose damages are under forty shillings. The Quarter Sessions for the Borough are holden on the Monday in the second week alter Epiphany, Easter, 7th of July, and Michael- mas, being the Mondays succeeding the County Quarter Sessions holden at Presteigne. The Sheriff's County Courts, for the recovery ofsmall debts under forty shillings, are holden here in alternate months with Presteigne. The Re- presentative for the Borough is chosen by the Burgesses of New Radnor, in con junction with those of the Contributary Boroughs of Knighton, Rhaiadar, Cefn Llys, and Cnwclas ; the Bailiff being the Returning Officer. As nothing but the circumstance of receiving Parochial relief disqualifies any person from being made a Burgess, who is regularly proposed and goes through the requisite forms, tiieir number is considerable: those of New Radnor are supposed to be about 300, and the whole number, including those of the Contributary Boroughs, is estimated at between 1200 and 1400. A qualification for a Burgess of New"], [569, "RAD Radnor must, however, be actual Residence in the Jurisdiction, at the time of Election; which is not the case with the Contributary Boroughs; and if a Capital Burgess becomes non-resident, he loses his privileges as such. The Benefit Society here commenced about the year 17 7 8, and now consists of nearly 100 Members ; each Member contributes \\0d. monthly, and in case of illness receives 5^. weekly, and at his death \u00a35. are paid towards the defraying of his Funeral expenses : in case of inability to follow his usual employment, though in health, he is allowed 2r. 6d. weekly. This Society has several Honorary members, who contribute each of them one guinea annually towards its support. The annual Meeting of the Members takes place on the 6th of January. The weekly Markets were originally holden on Tuesdays, but were discontinued about a Century ago ; attempts were, however, made about the year 1 778 to restore them, but for want ofproper accommodations they were again dropped, after having been holden for sour or five years. The Fairs are on the Tuesday before Holy Thursday, the Tuesday after Trinity Sunday, 14th of August, and 28th and 29th of October; the last of which is by far the greatest, when a con- siderable number of Sheep and Cattle are disposed of ; the 28th of October being appropriated to the sale of Sheep. The annual Wake is holden on the third Sunday in the Month of August. The Parish is divided into three parts, whereof the Town and Township of New Radnor is the principal ; the others are included in the Townships of Harpton and Badland, the remainder of which are in the Parish of Old Radnor. This Parish contains by estimation about 250O acres of inclosed Land, and about half the same quantity uninclosed. Henry Smith, Esq., ofthe City of London, by Indenture dated the 24th day of April, 1627, duly enrolled in the High Court of Chancery, settled and di- rected the payment offrom four to five pounds per annum, (the sum not being fixed, owing to repairs, ice), to be distributed among the more indigent Housekeepers and other industrious Poor ofthe Parish of New Radnor, pay- able out of an Estate and Lands, called Longney Farm, near Gloucester, as a Perpetual Charity. John Green, of the City of Hereford, Gentleman, by Will, dated the 10th day of December 1788, in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury settled and directed the payment of \u00a3300., the interest of which is to be distributed, as follows, ten pounds for ever to a Charity School in the Parish of New Radnor ; and three pounds per annum for ever to be given in Bread monthly amongst the most indigent Housekeepers, and other indus-"], [570, "R A 0 trious Poor in the said Parish ; and the remainder of the said Money to pur chase a Pulpit, Desk, and Altar clothes, and also a Hearse and a Pall for the Parish of New Radnor. There have been also other charitable Donations given to the Parish, but which seem to have been lost, for want of proper attention being paid to them. The Church consists of a Nave, a side Aisle on the South side, and a Chancel: it also has a Tower, which contains four large Bells, with a smaller one, and a Clock. The whole external length ofthe Church, together with the Tower and Chancel, is 144 feet; the internal length, exclusive ofthe Tower, 114; the breadth 33 feet : the side Aisle is divided from the Nave by five octagon Pillars, and six pointed Arches. Who ever carefully examines the Masonry of the Building, will perceive that the Tower, and a considerable part of the Church, were erected on a portion of Wall, which was probably part of a former Church, and which is supposed from the quality of the stones with which it was built, to have been co-eval with the Castle. The style of the Windows give some reason to believe that the later Edifice was erected in the reign of Edward the Third. The Tower, which is at present covered with a tiled Roof, was originally higher, and most probably embattled. The Forest of Radnor rises immediately from the North of the Town to a very considerable height : and from a prominent part of this eminence, which is opposite to the place, called The Wimble, are very extensive prospects, reaching into several Counties. Downton Hall, a modern built Seat of Percival Lewis, Esq., about a mile South East from the Town ; And Harpton Court, a Seat of Thomas Frankland Lewis, Esq., about a mile South of the last mentioned place, are surrounded by fine Scenery, and are great ornaments to the District. Water -break-its- Neck, a celebrated Water-fall of 70 feet in height, is situate about two miles Westward from the Town : and is much admired both on account of the wild Scenery and the pleasing effect of beholding the falling of the Water ; which, however, is seen most to ad vantage when a great quantity of rain has fallen. There is an intrenched Dyke, at the Western extremity of the Parish, and a mile from the Town, which was continued from one side of the narrow Vale to the other. And tradition still preserves the remembrance of a Battle having been sought in War Close, a Field at a short distance Eastward from the Town.\" RADNOR, OLD, or, PEN Y CRAIG, in the Cwmwd of Swydd Wyno gion, Cantref Y Clawdd (now called The Liberties ofthe Town of New Radnor),"], [571, "RAM Co. of Radnor, South Wales : a R. and V., with the Chapels of Ednol, and Kennarton, valued in the King's Books at \u00a335..1..0-f- : Patrons, The Dean and Chapter of Worcester.

This Parish contains about 600 Customary acres, which are equal to about 900 Statute acres, all cultivated; and nearly the same quantity of uncultivated Common, called Cefn y Brynn, which is celebrated for its sweet pasture for Sheep, and the con- sequent fineness of their Wool, and the excellence of the Mutton. It is sup- posed to take its Name from Sir Reginald de Breos, who was Lord of the Manor and Founder of the Church, which he dedicated to St. George, and after whom a very sine Well is called near the Church. A Post-Office has lately been estab- lished in this Village, from whence Letters are distributed three times a week. The present worthy Rector, The Rev. James Edwards, most obligingly adds, \" contiguous to St. George's Well, is another fine Spring, which is supposed to possess some Medicinal virtues, and is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. There is also on Cefn y Brynn a remarkable Well, called Holy Well, a very copious Spring, which has the remains of Antiquity about its square Inclosure: Tra- dition hands down it's celebrity for great cures, and it has been customary for the adjacent Neighbourhood to resort to it on Sunday Evenings to drink its water, and pay the tribute of throwing in a Pin. In a Field, adjoining Bryn field, some Roman antiquities have been discovered (where still are the remains of an ancient Encampment) by John Lucas, Esq., who has a handsome Resi- dence in this Parish, called Stout Hall. These antiquities were discovered by digo-ino- in a Fosse which surrounds the Encampment. The famous Druidical Monument, called Arthur's Stone, mentioned by Camden, is in this Parish, and is situate on the North side of Cefn y Brynn : it is supported by six rough Pillars ; there are four other Pillars standing alone, which supported a part of the Stone, now broken off, by what means, unknown, though it is said that it was broken off for the purpose of making Mill stones, but was afterwards found unfit for the intention : several smaller pieces have from time to time been broken off, chiefly through mere wickedness, so that it is much decreased in size ; it is supposed to weigh now about Twenty Tons, and to have been brought from a distance, as it is of a different quality to the Stone found upon the Hill : underneath it is a Spring of water, seldom dry. A great quantity of loose stones, thrown there by the Country people, served to hide some part of the Pil- lars, but were cleared away at the expense of Mr. Lucas. A handsome Road has 3Y"], [574, "R H A been made a!on\u00ab- the summit of this Hill by Thomas Mansel Taibot, Esq. ; from which there is a beautiful and extensive view of the Bristol Channel, the Coast of Devon, Pembroke, and Caermarthen, with the whole of the river Burry as far as Lloughor, and the whole of the Peninsula of Gower which from hence appears nearly an Island. This is a most delightful ride or drive in the summer season. On the summit of Cefn y Brynn are several large heaps of stones, particularly on the Eastern extremity, just above Pen Maen Church, and which is called The Beacon, by the Country People: these were, probably, either burying places or monuments erected by the Druids. In the Grounds at Stout Hall, is a Meini Gwyr fourteen feet long, composed of Gra nite, the same as Arthur's Stone: this Pillar is similar in shape and proportion to those of Stone Henge. And in the Garden is a very curious and extensive Cavern, large enough to contain two Thousand men ; the bottom of it is a plain about forty feet below the surface of the ground; there are two entrances into it, one by a long flight of rustic steps, the other by a gradual descent: The first discovery of it (a few years ago) was by a small natural Aperture in the Lime-stone rock, containing a very fast clay ; this Mr. Lucas scooped out, and was not a little gratified to find the hollow expand, and the fine arched Roof appear; his exploring mind then could not rest till he had scooped out some Thousands of Tons of Clay, which with a little assistance and now and then blowing the Rock, opened the finest Cavern in the Kingdom, and perhaps in Europe : the arched Roofs, in some places Thirty-six but not less than Ten feet high, are exceedingly grand ; and it is tolerably lighted by several natural openings through the incumbent earth.\"\u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Benefice, arising from Glebe Lands, Tythes, and Surplice fees, was \u00a379.. 1 3.. 11.

The Fairs are on the 6th and 27th of August, 26th of Septem ber, 14th of October, and Sd of December, for Horses, Sheep, and horned Cattle ; besides three great Markets in May. The present most worthy Min ister, The Rev. Henry Williams, A. M., (for whose great liberality and desire to promote these Topographical inquiries, the Author takes this oppor tunity publicly to express his warmest acknowledgements), in the kindest man ner adds, \" Rhayader is situate in the Latitude of 52\u00b0. 18', 5\" N. and Longitude 3\u00b0. 22'. 0\" W. from the Meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. It is an ancient Borough-Town, in the Diocese of St. David's, and being built on the River Wye, is called in the Welsh language Rhaiadr Gwy, from the rum bling noise and impetuosity of the River rushing amidst the resisting rocks. But this Ph\u00e6nomenon is now in a great measure removed. When a Stone bridge wa? erected over the Wye, A. D. 17 80, the aperture of the Rucks was dilated to facilitate the passage of the River, by which means it has lost much of its rapidity, and glides along in a more tranquil state. The Town lies in a Valley environed by the neighbouring hills, and contains four Streets, which intersect each other at right angles (the Town-Hall standing in the centre), and are nearly parallel to the four Cardinal points. It gives name to the Hundred, of 3 Y 2"], [576, "R H A which it forms a part, comprehending the Parishes of Cwm y dau ddwr, St. Harmon, Llanfihangel Fach, Llan Hir, and Nant Mel. In the Cantref Maeli enydd are the Comots of Ceri, Glynn Ieithon, Rhiw al allt, and Swydd Ygre. This is one of the five Contributary Boroughs, which return a Burgess to serve in Parliament for the Town of New Radnor. On the West-North-West side, formerly stood the Castle, built about A. D. 1178, by Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of South Wales, to check the incursions of the Normans, who, at this time, made great irruptions in the Marches of Wales. In 1194, Prince Rhys was surprized, and taken prisoner by his unnatural Sons. During this con finement, the Sons of Cadwalhon ap Madawc of Maelienydd besieged Rhaiadr Gwy Castle, which being surrendered up to them, they fortified for their own use. In the year 1231, Prince Llywelyn of North Wales, advanced with a great army, and sitting down before the Castle of Montgomery, he forced Hubert, Earl of Kent, King Henry the Third's General, to withdraw, and then making himself master of the place, he burnt it to the ground, and put the gar rison to the sword ; from thence he marched to Rhaiadr Gwy, which shared the like fate. Not a vestige ofthe Castle remains at this day, except the Fosse, having been dismantled, and totally demolished, during the Civil Wars. The Tower or Citadel stood in a direct line between the Castle and Gaol, overlook ing the River. The Mount adjacent still retains the Name of Tower-Hill. Near the Bridge, the Dominicans, or Black Friars sFratresJ, who came into England, A. D. 1221, had a Religious House, which, with others, was suppressed in the 31\u00b0 or King Henry VIII. The Town-Hall, a commodious Edifice for the purpose, was built by subscription, A. D. 1 762. Here are kept a Court Leet and a Court Baron; at the former of which the Burgesses are elected by the Town-Jury. It is a distinct Parish of itself. The Church is a plain, but neat Edifice ; it was re-built, A. D. 1733, and the Tower or Steeple, A. D. 1783. The Presbyte rians and Methodists have each a Conventicle, tolerated according to Law. Here is a Grammar School, and an endowment for the education of a limited number of poor Children. The School-house was built by subscription, A. D. 1793. The Town is governed by a Bailiff, who is annually elected at the Court Leet. It is exempt from the payment of County Rates. The quantity of inclosed and cultivated Land within the Borough, according to a Survey, made A. D. 1787, is 87 a. 0 r. 32 p. The uninclosed and uncultivated Land, containing Maesy Dr'ef, Maes Bach, and Waun y Capel, may be estimated at 90 acres. Part of Maes y Dref hath, at times, been inclosed and laid down in"], [577, "R H I tillage, and then is apportioned among the Householders, paying Scot and Lot, by a Pound Rate. The last Inclosure took place, A. D. 1775. In the year 457. Vortigern, being treacherously circumvented and discomfited by Hengist, whom he had invited to his assistance against the Picts and Scots, took shelter in the fastnesses of this neighbourhood. There are several Cams or Barrows in the vicinity of this place: the most remarkab'e of which is that of Tommen Sant Ffraid, on the West-South-West side of the Town, in the Parish of Cwm y dau ddwr, supposed to be the Cemetery of Saint Fraid, the Popish Tutelary Saint of that Parish. In remote times this Town was much more extensive than it is now, and the old Church more spacious than the present one. On Cefn Ceido, about half a mile from Rhaiadar, bearing East North East, is a Tract of Land, called Pantyr Eglwys, where, according to tradition, stood a Church, and it is said that the Borough extended to that place. The great Sessions for the County were holden here. The Gaol was in a place, where now stands a Presbyterian Meeting-House. The great iron-bars in the Windows remain at this day. The place for the execution of Criminals was on the North end of the Town, near a House known by the name of Peny Maes. The County- Court was alternately holden at New Radnor and Rhayader, but was removed from the latter place to the Town of Presteigne, by the 34th, and 35th of Henry VIII. A woollen Manufactory is carried on here, and in the neighbourhood, by means of carding engines and spinning machines. The Post comes in, and returns, three times a week. A Stage Coach passes on Mondays and Thurs days through this place between London and Aber Ystwith during the sum mer. The road between Rhayader and Aber Ystwith (a fashionable Sea-bath ing place, at the distance of 30 miles) is picturesque and romantic. About a mile and a half from Rhayader, the impending Rocks on the right, and on the left a Cascade, a Lake, and the adjoining Woods, with the verdant Meads be neath, arrest the Traveller's attention, and fill the mind with awe and pleasing sensations, in contemplating the stupendous works of Omnipotence. About eight miles in a South East direction lies Llan Drindod, a place in great repute on account of the Salubrity of its Air, and the Medicinal qualities of its Chalybeate and Saline waters, where several genteel Families resort in the Summer season.\" \u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, the yearly value of this Bene fice, arising from Augmentation, Moiety of Tythes, Glebe, Offerings, and Sur plice fees, was \u00a349- 19-0.

In this Parish are considerable Collieries. Near this is a great Caer, called The Garthen, i. e., Caer ddin, situate on the summit of a Hill, and containing about four acres of ground. Within the area are many vestiges of buildings, the habitations ofthe old possessors. It lies two Hundred yards from Offa's dike; along the top of which, part of the Turnpike road is formed for a considerable way. A fierce Battle was fought near this place between Owain Cyfeiliog, Prince of Powys, and the English, attended with victory to the ancient Britons ; which gave rise to a beautiful Poem, called Hirlas Owain, or, The Drinking Horn of Owain. composed by the Prince himself. The emi nent Antiquary, David Powel, D. D., was Vicar of this Church, where he"], [579, "R H O died in 1590, and is here buried.

In the last Century, the Mansion and Estate were conveyed, by sale, to the Wynnes of Wynnstay, Whether a Grant of a Tract in Cyfeilioc was made by one of the Kings of England to his own Countrymen, when the power of the Princes of Powys was decreasing, according to a current Tradition, we know not: Some attribute the great number of English surnames in the Parish of Llan Brynn Mair, and the Neighbourhood, to a Regiment of Soldiers which was quartered at Machyn llaeth during the Protectorate, and disbanded at the Restoration. But in whatever manner, or period, these English settlers came to Cyfeilioc, they still retain their surnames, though they have changed their Language : several of them scarcely knowing a word of English. Some of the foreign names here are Webster, Baxter, Tibbot, Swancoat, Jervis, Medings, Bebb, Stubb, Red dings, Tanner, and Jerman, Sec. William Baxter, Author of the Glossarium An liquilatum Romanarum, was of this Tribe, and born in Llan Llugan, in this County. RHODOGEIDIO, *, RHODWYDD GEIDIO.

This Parish contains about 1500 acres of Land ; of which, about 300 acres are uninclosed and uncultivated. It is situate upon St. George's Chan nel. The Church is supposed to have been built about the year 630. A green Amianthus, or brittle Asbestos, is met with in great plenty, in a green marble here. The Rev. Robert Williams, the present Curate, very obligingly adds, \" Rowlands, in his Mona Antiqua Restaurata, derives Rhos Colyn thus, ' Rhos Colyn, or Colofn, a Column ; the Romans usually erecting Columns at the utmost Bounds of their Victories, as Dion Cassius relates.' Rhos, in the Welsh language, means a Tract or a Piece of uncultivated Land. There is an imperfect Tradition in the Parish, that Colyn or lolyn is a Man's name : this, however, is uncertain. It is commonly understood, that its ancient Name was Llanwenfaen. Rowlands also observes the same, and that Gwenfaen, the daugh ter of Palken, had her cloyster at Rhos Colyn, which after became a Parish"], [581, "R H O Church, called Llan Gwenfaen ; as her brother's cloyster was called Llan Beulan. In the compound, Llanwensaen, the letter G is omitted, euphonia gratia. That there was, at one time or other, a House of Worship standing on the spot which is now pointed out as its Site (and which may formerly have given name to the Parish), appears most probable, as well from the general prevalence of the Tradition, as from the constant discovery of Human bones, whenever that piece of ground is cut up either by the spade, or the Ploughshare.\" \u2014 RHOS CROWTHER, v.

The Resident Population of this Hamlet, in 1801, and the Money raised by the Parish Rates, in 1803, are included in the Returns made from Llanfihangel Brynn Pab Jeuan. In this Hamlet, near Pare Wood, are three Mineral Springs, which are much resorted to in the Summer Season. Ferreg, or, Ferlex, a Ter ritory noticed in the ancient Welsh Histories, was that extent of Country which lies between the rivers Wye and Severn ; and was governed by its own Reguli, who also possessed a considerable portion of Brycheiniog, or, Brecknockshire, as it is now named. Rhos Fferreg, therefore, though situate on the opposite side of the river Wye, from Fferreg or Ferlex properly so called, had in all prob ability its name from thence ; and is now perhaps the only spot which records that ancient Name. This was one of the Mansions of Elystan Glodrydd, the stock of one of the Five Royal tribes of Wales, and is now (in 1805) the property of one of his lineal descendants.

In the village of Rhos Market, is an old Mansion, now a Farm-house, which was an ancient Seat of the Family of Walter, and re markable at this day for nothing but its having been the Birth-place of the cele brated Lucy Walter, mistress to King Charles the Second, and mother to the un fortunate Duke of Monmouth.

It suffered very much in the Wars of King Edward the First with Llywelyn ab Grufydd, the last Prince of Wales, but recovered and subsisted till the Dissolution, when it was granted, 32\u00b0 Hen.

Morfa 3Z2"], [584, "R H U Rhuddlan is celebrated for the Battle fought there in 795, between the Saxons and Welsh; when Caradoc, king of North Wales, fell in the conflict: It is unknown whether the fine plaintive Welsh tune took its name from this or some later occasion : Mr. Jones, in his Musical Relicks, p. 50, has favoured us with the Music, together with sour pathetic verses taken from a Fragment pub lished in the Letters from Snowdon. The Castle, which has been a handsome buildincr, was dismantled by order of Parliament, in 1646. It was made a free Borough by Edward the First, who appointed the Constable of the Castle, for the time being, to be Mayor, and the Bailiffs to be chosen annually by the Burgesses on Michaelmas day, who were to be presented to the Constable to be sworn. But no Constable has been appointed since the days of Oliver Cromwell. The Burgesses contribute towards electing a Member for the Borough of Flint: those who are qualified inhabit the place, and that part of the Parish called Rhuddlan Franchise, which extends above a mile from the Town. A Parliament is said to have been holden here in 1283, when the famous Statute of Rhudd lan was enacted. A piece of ancient Building, called The Parliament House, is still to be seen here; probably the place where Edward the First sat in Council : and from hence he actually practised the well-known deceit of giving them a Prince born among them, who never spoke a word of English, and whose life and conversation no man was able to stain : all which the discon tented Nobility eargerly accepted, little thinking the person intended, to be the infant Edward, just born at Caernarvon. In the 16th vol. of Archaeologia, p. 32, is a Copy of the Roll of the expenses of Edward the First at Rhudd lan Castle, in the tenth and eleventh years of his reign, containing many very curious and interesting particulars of the sums paid to the several Workmen employed upon the Castle, as communicated from the Original Record in the Tower by that most judicious and excellent Antiquary Samuel Lysons, Esq.

This Lordship comprises the three Comots of Coleigion, Dog feilyn, and Llannerch : and the two Aldermen, with Sixteen Common Council men, are annually chosen in the Lordship Court.

Im mediately opposite, to the South East, is a strong British encampment, with vast ramparts of loose stones ; which is vainly supposed by some persons to have been the Camp of Car actacus, when he was overcome by Ostorius. Rhyd Esgyn, they say, is the incertum vadum of Tacitus, and the Peaks of Moel- Golfa, and Cefn Cestyll, are the juga montium of the same author. But, where is the Roman Camp?

It has since been augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty, and from the fortunate circumstance of one of the Lots purchased in the County of Glamorgan having Coal and Mine under it, the Curacy is become more valuable than the Living. The right of Sepulture, Christenings, and even Weddings, has been claimed and exercised here for some years ; but this appears to be irregular, and if so, the sooner it is prohib ited, or the claim abandoned, the better. The present Curate was licensed, about ten or twelve years ago, upon the Nomination of the owners and occu piers of Lands in the Hamlet of Ys Clydach, though not without many doubts being entertained as to the legal validity of their claim, if it had been contested by the Vicar.

The extreme end is about four Leagues South South West from St. Tudwal's road. Numbers of Vessels have been lost here, owing, ina great measure, to Captain Collins ' s Chart, which makes 10 and 17 fathoms in the very middle of it, when it is correctly ascertained to become dry the last quarter ebb. There are several large loose stones on the extreme end, dry at low water Spring tides; one of which is four yards diameter, and would bear fixing a Perch upon : this would be of general use to Navigation.

The Rock in the mouth of the Haibour, and the high lands about it, make it appear as one solid Cliff, though there is three fathom at low water between and the rock. A white House or Turret ought to be erected on the high ground on St. Elvis's point, and another on the opposite side of the Harbour, that could be seen from any part of the Bay.

The Chapel is a paltry Edifice, erected in the Cemetery of the Abbey, which stands to the South, proudly over-topping its contemptible rival. According to Mr. Meyrick, The Rev. Thomas Davies was the last Minister presented to this Chapel : who is a Gentleman well respected, and well attended. The old Churchyard, as it is called, is a very large plot of ground, surrounded with a stone wall, but the present one is about two acres. In it are several Tombstones. The extent of the old Cemetery is said to be 120 acres, and leaden Coffins are frequently dug up within ihat space ; but what tends most to confirm this is, that so much of the Abbey land does not pay tythe.

It is nearly square, about a yard each way. At the bottom is a handsome fringe, or in the Provincial term, Ddrums. The Whittle is thrown across the Shoulders, and fastened before, with a Pin or Broach. But the old Provincial mode of fastening it, was with the Prickle of a black Thorn, which being itself of a tough nature, and being dried, is sufficiently strong to penetrate the Whittle. Some of the old Women retain it to this day. The Whittle is also worn in the Neighbourhood of Fishguard, in the County of Pembroke, where there is a Colony of the same People, as the Gowerians (Flemings).

Mr. Gough's description of it in his Camden's Britannia, as \" a large, well built Town among woods,\" is erroneous: it being in fact an indifferent Village, wholly destitute of all wood, except in the Hedge-rows. The ivy-mantled ruins ofthe Castle are seen on the right hand ofthe road to Brecknock. \" The fair place of Henry Vehan, Esq.,\" mentioned by Leland, is still in part standing, but too much dismantled to deserve that name at present. The Manor of Tre'r Twr was granted to a Knight, named Pycard, by Bernard de Newmarch, to be holden by Knight's service as of the Lordship of Blaen Llyfni. It has since passed through the Families of Bloet, Berkeley, and Her bert, into that of Somerset, now Duke of Beaufort, the present Possessor. The Vaughans had also a considerable property here, with a Mesne Manor: but the last owner of that Name, dissipated nearly the whole of it. Near the Castle, is the Chapel, endowed with a Stipend, chargeable upon a certain Portion of the Parochial Tythes, called The Priory Tythes, which had been granted by the first Pycard, to the Monks of Brecknock, and afterwards confirmed to them by his descendant Sir John Pycard.

Tradition says, that there was a Chapel formerly in this Parish, called Capel Twr Gwynn, but there are now no vestiges of it. The present Name of the Parish is Troed yr Aur, which signifies, The Golden Foot, from the supposition that Gold was formerly found at the foot of the Mountain on which the Church stands : But it was anciently called Llanfihangel Ties Teyrn : \u2014 Tref Teyrn, which implies The King's Abode, having been, perhaps, for merly the Residence of some Prince of Ceredic's Line, or other Chieftain who possessed this County, whilst struggling for liberty against the Saxons, Danes, Flemings, and Normans. The Church is a handsome, modern Edifice, rebuilt about ten years ago at the sole expense of The Rev. Thomas Bowen, the present Rector (in 1810) ; whose Mansion, called also Troed yr Aur, is a beautiful Seat. \u2014 I.

It is situate on the banks of the river Meiric. The present most worthy Curate (and Head Master of the Free Grammar School), The Rev. John Williams, in the kindest manner adds, \" There is a Fair kept here annually on the 2d and 3d days of July, principally for the Sale of Wool and Pigs. Here is a well endowed (and well conducted) Free Grammar School, founded by Edward Richard, an eminent Welsh Critic, and an elegant Pastoral Poet, who was a Native of this Place; to which 32 poor Boys, from any part of the County, (preference being given to those of the Parish and Neighbourhood) have a right of admission. Annexed to this, there is another Endowment for the benefit of 40 poor Boys of the Upper Division of Llanfi hangel Llethyr Troed, an adjoining Parish. A well built School-room has lately been erected ; to which a well furnished Library is annexed. The Number of acres in the Chapelry are supposed to be about 700 ; of which, 200 acres are a Common belonging to three adjoining Farms, and, consequently, totally un cultivated ; the remainder, about half inclosed, and half cultivated. Cultivation and inclosing have, however, much advanced of late years. The whole Lands of the Chapelry, as well as a very large Territory besides, were the property of the Abbey of Strata Florida, situate about three statute Miles to the South"], [645, "Y S T hence.\" \u2014 According to the Diocesan Report, in 1809, this Benefice has no Endowment or Emolument whatsoever, separate from Y Spytty Rhiw Yst with ; but is obliged to be regularly served by the Incumbent of Y Spytty Rhiw Ystwith. From the first account of the Castle (the ruins of which are small, but strong, situate on a fine gravelly Hillock, near the Village) it appears that, when Grufydd ap Rhys was about to lay siege to the Castle of Aber Yst with, the Governor, Ralph Steward, sent to Ystrad Meiric for reinforcement, which was conveyed secretly by night. In 1137, it was destroyed, with several others, by Owain Gwynedd and his Brother Cadwaladyr. In 1150, Cadell Meredydd and Rhys (Sons of Grufydd ap Rhys) took it from Hywel ap Owain Gwynedd, and fortified it. In the year II58, Roger, Earl of Clare, took this Castle, and fortified it. In 11 89, it was taken by Maelgon ap Rhys, who gave it, in 1194, to Anarawd his Brother, as a ransom for liberating his two Brothers Hywel and Madog, whom Anarawd had made prisoners, and put out their eyes. He did not keep it long; for, in 1198, Maelgon re-took it from the Normans. In 1204, Maelgon, despairing to withstand Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, from whom he expected an hostile visit, razed it. and it, probably, never was re-built.

Tal y, Faen Castle, of which there are some remains, was one of the Castles belonging to the thirteen Peers of Glamorgan. It was granted by Sir Robert Fitz Hamon to Sir Richard de Sevvard, in whose Family it continued for many Generations, and from whom it came by Marriage to the Dukes of Lancaster. It is still a part of the Duchy of Lancaster.
