The large size of this volume on Descriptive Mineralogy, e Receding by one-half tbe corresponding part of the preceding edition, is not without good reason. In the first place, the long interval of fourteen years has elapsed since the last edition was published, and during this period the science has made great progress. Chemical researches have been carried forward in connection with almost every spe cies, and analyses have been largely multiplied ; and it is the plan of the work to he complete in this department, so far as to include all analyses. Crystallographic investigations also have been numerous and important. Moreover, the number of species has been much enlarged, and every part of the science has had accessions of facts. In addition, a new feature has been given the work, in the systematic recognition and description ofthe varieties of species. The first edition of this Treatise, that of 1837, was written in the spirit of the school of Mohs. The multitudes of subdivi sions into subspecies, varieties, and subvarieties, based largely on unimportant cha racters, which had encumbered the science through the earlier years of this century, and were nearly smothering the species, were thrown almost out of sight by Mohs, in his philosophic purpose to give prominence and precision to the idea of the species. Much rubbish was cleared away, and the science elevated thereby ; but much that was necessary to a full comprehension of minerals in their diversified states w-as lost sight of. In the present edition an endeavor is made to give varieties their true place ; and to insure greater exactness with regard to them, the original locality of each is stated with the description. Further, the work has received another new feature in its historical synonymy. A list of synonyms has hitherto been mainly an index to works or papers on the species, and often without any regard to the original describer or description. Hadsmann's admirable Handbuch (1847) is partly an exception. Leonhard's \" Oryktognosie \" (1821, 1826), following the method of Reuss of the opening cen tury, contains a full catalogue of references to publications on each species ; but it fails of half its value because the references have no connection in any way with the synonymy. In most recent works, an author who has merely adopted a name is often quoted as if the original authority. The present work is no longer open to this criticism. As now issued, the first author and first place of publication of each species, and of each name it has borne, and of the names of all its varieties, are stated in chronological order, with the dates of all publications cited ; and, besides, remarks are added in the text when the subject is one of special interest. The facts and con elusions have been derived in almost all cases from the study of the original works themselves ; and this Treatise has become thereby, to some extent, an account of ancient as well as modern minerals. These historical researches added a third to the labor of preparing the edition for the press, thereby delaying the publication of tlie work about a year. But such studies are endless, especially when they relate to past centuries, and the work, however long continued, must be incomplete. As an example : the word schorl, which figured largely in the miueralogy of the last"], [12, "IV PREFACE. century and the earlier part of the present, is traced by some writers to the Swedish, and is cited from Cronstedt (1758). From Dr. Naumann, of Leipsic, I learned of the occurrence of the word in the Magnalia Dei of Bruckmann (1727). After ward I found it in Ercker's Aula Subterranea (1595) ; and later in Gesner on Fossils (1565), and in the Sarepta of Matthesius (1562), which contains a detailed description of it. In what earlier works the word occurs, and what was its origin, are among the questions unanswered. (See further p. 205.) The introduction of formulas on the basis of the new system of chemistry , with the necessary explanations, constitutes another addition. The formulas, it will be observed, while in principle those of the leaders of the system, have some peculiar features, serving to give them greater compactness on the page, and make them more easy of comparison, and bringing out well the unity and simplicity of type among inorganic compounds. In these and other ways the volume has unavoidably become enlarged. Not a page, and scarcely a paragraph, of the preceding edition remains unaltered, and full five-sixths of the volume have been printed from manuscript copy. I may here add, that, notwithstanding the impaired state of my health, this manuscript \u2014 the para graphs on the pyrognostic characters excepted \u2014 was almost solely in the handwri ting of the author, or in that of a copyist from it. Neither the consultation of original authorities, the drawing of conclusions, nor the putting of the results on paper, has been delegated to another. And being now but half way between the fifties and sixties, it is my hope that the future will afford another opportunity for similar work. The optical qualities of minerals have been but briefly stated, and in general for those species alone which seemed to require this addition to their distinctive charac ters, as a full presentation of them would have added much more to the size of the volume. The best work on the subject, and one containing many original observa tions, is the excellent Mineralogy of DesCloizeaux, the first volume of which, on the Silicates, was published in 1862. The second, unfortunately for the science, has not yet appeared. Other works in this department are Brooke & Miller's Mineralogy (1852) ; Grailich's Vienna edition of Miller's Crystallography (1856), and his own Krystallographisch-optische Untersuchungen (1&58). In classification, the general system remains unaltered. It is based on a compre hensive view of the characters of minerals as species in the inorganic kingdom of nature, the preeminence being given to chemical, the next place to crystallooraphic, the third to the different physical characters. The author believes (after having tried the so-called natural history system of Mohs for two editions) that lierht from no source should be shut out where the relations of species and groups in nature are to be determined. As in the preceding edition, the method avoids almost entirely the distinction, in most cases wrong, founded on the fact ofthe base in oxygen ternaiies or salts being in the protoxyd state, or in the sesquioxyd, or in both combined, and proceeds on the ground that the basic elements in these and the other different states are mutually replaceable in certain proportions determined by their combining power with oxygen. But while the progress of chemistry and the kindred sciences requires no modification of the general plan of the classification, but gives it new support, it has rendered many minor changes necessary, and some that are of muefc importance. The historical inquiries above alluded to were prompted by a desire to place the nomenclature of mineralogy on a permanent basis. They were incident to a search after a reason for choosing one name rather than another from amono- the numbei that stand as claimants. Part of the existing diversity is due to national partiality, and much of it to indifference. It has become somewhat common for authors to .select the name the**, like best without reference to authority, or to reject an old foi"], [13, "PREFACE. V a new one on no other ground than that of their preference. Increasing confusion in nomenclature has consequently attended the recent progress of the science ; and in view of this fact the novel expedient has been tried of endeavoring to escape the confusion by adding one more to the number of names. The right method is mani festly that which has proved so successful in the other natural sciences, viz., the recognition, under proper restrictions, of the law of priority ; and this method the author has aimed to carry out. Moreover, it has seemed best that the science should not only have a system of nomenclature, but should also stand by it ; that, accordingly, the termination ine, which is prominently chemical, should be left to the chemists, and that other miscellaneous endings should, as far as possible, be set aside, or be made to conform to the system. With this in view, changes have been made in accordance with the principles explained in the course of the remarks beyond on Nomenclature. In the preparation of this volume, the author owes much to the cooperation of his friend, Prof. George J. Brush. Prof. Brush has had sole charge of the blowpipe department. The pyrognostic characters have been entirely rewritten by him ; and while he has had the works of Plattner and von Kobell always at hand, he has, for much the larger part of the species, made personal trials of the reactions before writing them out; so that, although the facts stated are not generally new, they still are mostly from his own observations. His skill also in analytical chemistry, and his thorough knowledge of minerals, have enabled him to remove doubts, afford aid and advice, and furnish new facts, on various points throughout the progress of the work. Prof. Brush has also given the proofs, while the work was in the press, the benefit of his revision. I take pleasure also in acknowledging the assistance of Prof. George F. Barker of this city, an excellent chemist in both the old and new systems, during thc last six months before the book went to press ; and later, that of Sydney I. Smith, assistant in the zoological department of Yale College. The author is under obligations to many men of science for their kind response to his inquiries, and for much information in their letters ; among whom be would mention, with gratitude, Dr. Carl F. Naumann of Leipzig, W. Haidinger of Vienna, Prof. von Kobell of Munich, Friedrich Hessenberg of Frankfort-on-the-Main, Dr. G. vom Rath of Bonn, Dr. G. A.

Jefferis, Esq., of Westchester, Pa., and Prof. A. Winchell of Ann Arbor, Michigan. In addition, the book has received private contributions to the text of analyses and other information from P. Collier, B. S. Burton, C. S. Rodman, C. A. Goess mann, C. S. Sharples, G. F. Barker, G. C. Wheeler, and E. W. Root. Among works consulted, the publications on chemical mineralogy of Kammelsberq of Berlin, and especially his Mineralchemie, have afforded great assistance. The vary sn*] \u00bb0<] nble Annual Reports (or Uebersichte) of Dr. Kenngott of Zurich, on"], [14, "PREFACE. VI the progress of mineralogy from 1844 to 1861, and those of the Giessen Jahresbe richt, have been freely and constantly consulted. Much use has been made also of the mineralogical works of DesCloizeaux, Dufrenoy, Hausmann, Breithaupt, Naumann, Haidinger, von Kobell, Kokscharof, Hessenberg, Quenstedt, Brooke & Miller, Greg & Lettsom, and Shepard; also the valuable History (Geschichte) of Mineralogy of von Kobell ; the classical work on the Precious Stones and Gems of the Ancients by King ; and the various recent American Geological Reports. Among these Reports, the volume of the Canadian survey for the year 1863, containing extended mineralogical contributions by Prof. T. S. Hunt, deserves special mention. A full list of the works consulted in studying up the history of the species, and the later progress of the science, is to be found on pages xxxv to xiv of the Introduction. In Crystallography, the sources of recent information have been mainly Kokscha rof's Mineralogie Russlands, and his Memoirs in the Bulletin of the St. Petersburg Academy ; DesCloizeaux's Mineralogie, and various Memoirs ; the Mineralogische Notizen of F. Hessenberg, of which eight parts have appeared ; Naumann's and Quenstedt's works on Mineralogy ; the Memoirs of Zippe, von Zepharovich, Grai lich, A. Schrauf, v. Lang, Zirkel, and Kenngott, in the Berichte and Denkschrif ten (mostly the former) of the Vienna Academy ; of Dauber, G. Rose, vom Ra*rh, Schroder, Schabus, in Poggendoiff's Annalen ; of Websky and vom Rath, in the Zeitschrift of the German Geological Society at Berlin ; of A. E. Nordenskiold, in the \u0152fversigt of the Swedish Academy ; of Quintino Sella, in his Studii, and in the publications of the Turin Academy ; of Miller, v. Lang, Maskelyne, and Greg, in the Philosophical Magazine ; of Prof. J. P. Cooke, in the American Journal of Science. The Mineralogy of Brooke & Miller (1852) has been freely used again, as in the preparation of the preceding edition. This volume would probably be more acceptable to some chemists if the formulas on the old system were rejected altogether. But chemistry has not advanced so far on the new road, but that most mineralogical papers are still written as if there were no new system, and a large part of chemists would understand the constitution of the species better from the old formulas than from the new. Moreover, the great majority of the persons who consult a Mineralogy would find the new formulas and new ter minology quite unintelligible. It has seemed reasonable therefore that both systems should be presented. The new formulas will be more easily understood or learned from their association with the old, and thus the book may help forward the views it only partially adopts. The past history of the work evinces no aversion to change where the progress of science requires it. This work has been posted up, as far as was possible, to the date of publication. The facts which have come to hand too late for their proper place in the volume, are inserted in a Supplement. And it is proposed to make this the first of a series of supplements to appear from time to time in the American Journal of Science. JAMES D. DANA. April 30, 1868. From the Preface to the First Edition (1837). ***** -pjjg classification of the mineral species, which is hero adopted, is strictly a Natural Arrangement. The superiority of this method is exhibited in the body of the work, and in connection with the remarks on Chemical Classifica tions, in Appendix B. Although founded by Mohs on the external characters of minerals, it exhibits, in a considerable degree, the chemical relations of the species ; and those who are accustomed to prefer a chemical arrangement will probably per ceive that, in addition to such qualities as appear to recimimend the chemical method it possesses other advantages not less important."], [15, "PREFACE. VII The changes which have been made in the nomenclature of minerals appear to be demanded by the state of the Science. The present names, excepting those pro posed by Mohs, are utterly devoid of system, unless we may consider such the addition of the syllable ite to words of various languages ; and even this glimmering of system has been capriciously infringed by a French mineralogist of much celebrity ; \u2014 they seldom designate any quality or character peculiar to the mineral ; neithei do they exhibit any of the general relations of the species, by which the mind may, at a glance, discover their natural associations, and be assisted in obtaining a com prehensive view of the science. On the contrary, they are wholly independent, and often worse than unmeaning, appellatives, and are only tolerable in a very unadvanced state of the Science. As a necessary consequence of this looseness of nomenclature, most of the species are embarrassed with a large number of synonyms, a fertile source of confusion and difficulty. As a remedy for this undesirable state of things, a system of nomenclature, con structed on the plan so advantageously pursued in Botany and Zoology, was proposed by the author in the fourth volume of the Annals of the New York Liyceum. The necessity for something of the kind is very apparent, and the author trusts that it will not be considered a needless innovation. ****** From the Preface to the Second Edition * (1844). The natural system adopted in this Treatise has received such modifications in the present edition as were demanded by the advanced state of the Science ; and the systematic nomenclature has required some corresponding changes. Besides the natural classification, another, placing the minerals under the princi pal element in their composition, has been given in Part VII. ; and various improve ments on the usual chemical methods have been introduced, which may render it acceptable to those that prefer that mode of arrangement. * * * * From the Preface to the Third Edition (1850). This Treatise, in the present edition, has undergone so various and extensive alter ations, that few of its original features will be recognized. The science of Mineralogy ha's made rapid progress in the past six years ; chemistry has opened to us a better knowledge of the nature and relations of compounds ; and philosophy has thrown new light on the principles of classification. To change is always seeming fickleness. But not to change with the advance of science, is worse ; it is persistence in error ; and, therefore, notwithstanding the former adoption of what has been called the Natural History System, and the pledge to its support given by the author in sup plying it with a Latin nomenclature, the whole system, its classes, orders, genera, and Latin names, have been rejected ; and even the trace of it which the synonymy might perhaps rightly bear has been discarded. The system has subserved its pur pose in giving precision to the science, and displaying many of the natural group ings which chemistry was slow to recognize. But there are errors in its very foun dation, which make it false to nature in its most essential points ; and, in view of the character of these errors, we are willing it should be considered a relic of the past. Yet Science is far from being ready with an acceptable substitute. Most chemical systems have been more artificial than the \" natural \" system ; and doubts now hang * This edition, failing to find a publisher in New York, was printed at the expense of the author."], [16, "VIII PREFACE. over some of the principles of chemistry that are widest in their influence on classi fication. In view of the difficulties on either side, it was a point long questioned, whether to venture upon a classification that might be deemed most accordant with truth among the many doubts that surround the subject ; or to adopt one less strict to science, that might serve the convenience of the student for easy reference, and for the study of mineralogy in its economical bearings, while, at the same time, it should exhibit many natural relations, and inculcate no false affiliations or distinc tions of species. The latter alternative has been adopted ; \u2014 the classification is offered simply as a convenient arrangement, and not an exhibition of the true affini ties of species in the highest sense of the term. Among the Silicates, however, it will be perceived that the groupings in the main are natural groupings ; and, through out the work, special care has been taken to inculcate, as far as possible, the true relations of species, both by remarks, and by an exhibition of them in tables. * * From the Preface to the Fourth Edition (1854). In the Preface to the last edition of this Treatise, the classification of minerals then adopted was announced as only a temporary expedient. The system of Mohs, valuable in its day, had subserved its end ; and in throwing off its shackles for the more consistent principles flowing from recent views in Chemistry, the many diffi culties in the way of perfecting a new classification led the author to an arrange ment which should \" serve the convenience of the student without pretending to strict science.\" A classification on chemical principles was however proposed in the latter part of the volume, in which the Berzelian method was coupled with crystallography in a manner calculated to display the relations of species in composition as well as form, and prominently \" exhibit the various cases of isomorphism and pleomorphism among minerals.\" The progress of Science has afforded the means of giving greater precision and simplicity to this arrangement, until now it seems entitled to become the authorized method of a System of Mineralogy. Whether regarded from a phy sical or chemical point of view, the groupings appear in general to be a faithful exhibition of the true affinities of the species. The mind uneducated in Science may revolt at seeing a metallic mineral, as galena, side by side with one of unmetallic lustre, as blende ; and some systems, in accordance with this prejudice, place these species in separate orders. Like the jeweller, without as good reason, the same works have the diamond and sapphire in a common group. But it is one of the sublime lessons taught in the very por tals of Chemistry, that nature rests no grand distinctions on lustre, hardness, or color, which are mere externals, and this truth should be acknowledged by the min eralogist rather than defied. Others, while recognizing the close relations of the carbonates of lime, iron, zinc, and manganese (calcite, spathic iron, smithsonite, and dialogite), or of the silicates of lime, iron, manganese (wollastonite, augite, rhodo nite), are somewhat startled by finding silicate of zinc, or silicate of copper, among the silicates of the earths, or of other oxyds. But the distinction of \" useful \" and \" useless,\" or of \" ores \" and \" stones,\" although bearing on \" economy,\" is not Science. ******** \u00c6^^."], [17, "TABLE OF CONTENTS. Introduction.

The object of this introduction is to supply such tables and information as wiL make the work convenient for use ; and, toward this end, some explanations of an elementary character are included, with special reference to readers not familiar with chemistry and other collateral sciences. 1. General Scheme of Arrangement in the Descriptions. In the Descriptions of Species, the characteristics are mentioned in the following order : \u2014 1, Crystalline Form and Structure ; 2, Hardness, Specific Gravity, Lustre, Color, Diaphaneity, etc. ; 3, Varieties, Chemical Composition ; 4, Pyrognostic and other Chemical characters ; 5, under the head of Observations, Geological positim, Localities, Mineral associates, etc. ; 6, Altered forms ; 7, Artificial and Furnace products. 2. Chemistry. 1. A barred letter in a symbol of an element, in the table of atomic weights wheh follows, and also throughout the work (except in formulas after the new system, see p. xv), signifies two atoms ofthe element: e. g., Al=2 Al or AP. 2. Dots over a symbol stand each for j.v atom of oxygen in the compound refeired to: e.g., Sl=2Al+3 0, or AP 0s ; and Ba=BaO. 3. The atomic weight of a compound equals the sum of the atomic weights of iU constituents : e. g., for Sl, the atomic weight=2 x 13-75 + 3 x 8=51-5 ; for Ba \u2014 68-5 + 8=76-5 ; for Sl Si, the atomic weight=51-5 + 30=81-5. 4. The atomic ratio for the constituents of a compound is the ratio between 'the number of atoms of the same : e. g., for the aluminum and oxygen in Sl, it is 2 : 3 ; for the alumina and silica in Sl Si it is 1 : 1, there being 1 of alumina to 1 of silba ; for the aluminum, silicon, and oxygen in Sl Si, it is 2:1:5, there being in the compound 2 of aluminum, 1 of silicon, and 5 of oxygen (5 dots). 5. The oxygen ratio for the constituents of an oxygen compound is the ratio between the number of atoms of oxygen in the different oxygen compounds present : e. g., the O. ratio for the alumina and silica in Sl Si is 3 : 2, alumina containing 3 O and silica 2 0; for the magnesia and silica in Mg Si, the O. ratio is 1 : 2. <6. The percentage ratio (or number of parts in 100) for the constituents of a compound is deduced from the ratio between the atomic weight of the compound and that of each constituent: e. g., as 51-5 of alumina contain 24 of oxygen, so 100 will contain 46-6 ; or, for the percentage of aluminum, 51-5 : 27-5 : : 100 : 53-4 ; again, as 81-5 Sl Si contain 30 of silica, hence 81-5 : 30 : : 100 : the silica in the compound, etc. ; or since Sl Si contain 27-5 Al + 14-0 Si + 40-0 0, making in all as before 81-5, hence 81-5 : 27-5 : : 100 : the p. c. of aluminum ; or 81-5 : 40 : : 100 : the p. c. of oxygen; etc."], [20, "TABLE OF ATOMIC WEIGHTS.

The percentage of oxygen in each of the oxygen compounds enumerated in the preceding table of atomic weights is stated in parentheses after the atomic weight o: the compound ; and the percentage of sulphur, in the same manner, after the atomic weight of many of the sulphids. 7. The atomic ratio is calculated from the percentage ratio, by dividing each number by the atomic weight of the constituent : the percentage ratio of Al and 0 in alumina being 53-4 : 46-6, 53*4^-13-75 gives 3-93, and 46-9-*- 8=5-85 ; whence the ratio 3-93 : 5-85, which, by dividing the larger by the smaller, is found to equal 1 : 1-5 or 2 : 3, which is the atomic ratio of the aluminum to the oxygen. For the compound Sl Si, the percentage of silica and alumina is 36*8, 63-2 ; whence, dividing the former by 30 (at. w. of silica), and the latter by 51-5 (at. w. of alumina), the ratio obtained is 1 : 1, the compound consisting of 1 of each alumina and silica ; or taking the percentage for the silicon, aluminum, and oxygen in the same, and dividing them, respectively, by 14, 13-75, 8, the ratio deduced would be 1 : 2 : 5. 8. The ratio of alumina and silica in a compound may also be obtained by com paring the amounts of oxygen in the percentages of the constituents. Take, e. g., a silicate of alumina consisting of Si' 36-8, Sl 63-2=100. If 100 of silica contain 53-33 of oxygen (see table) then 36*8 will contain 36*8 X -5333 or 19-625 (since 100 : 36-8 : : 53-33 : the required percentage) ; so if 100 of alumina contain 46-6 of oxygen, 63-2 will contain 46-6 X -632 or 29-45; now 19-625 : 29-45 (the ratio obtained)=2 : 3 ; and since silica contains 2 of oxygen and alumina 3, it follows from the result of the calculation that the compound contains 1 of silica to 1 of alumina, or has the formula Sl Si. This is the usual method of calculating the ratio of the constituents in the case of oxyds. It involves multiplications of the percent age of each of the constituents by the percentage of ox)-gen for that constituent; and in order to facilitate these multiplications a table is given below the table of atomic weights, containing multiples of these oxygen percentages for each of the digits 1 to 9. 9. The letter R is used as a general symbol for any element ; it, for protoxyds in general ; fi, for sesquioxyds in general. 10. In the formula 3 Ca2 Si + SF Si3, the prefix 3 applies to the whole Ca2 Si (or, in general, to all before the first comma, or first + or \u2014 ) ; but the small * only to Ca, it signifying 2 Ca; and, in the second part, the small ** signifies that there are 2 SI, and the small \\ 3 iii. The oxygen ratio for the Ca and Si in the first part is 1 : 1, there being 2 Ca to 1 Si, 2 Ca as well as 1 si containing 2 O ; and in the second part it is 1 : 1, there being 2 Sl to 3 Si. The oxygen ratio for the whole Ca, Sl, Si in tho formula is 6 : 6 : 12=1 : 1 : 2 ; and for the Oa+ Sl, Si it is 1 + 1 : 2 or 1 : 1. In the formula (i Ca'+4; Sl)3 Si3, the index ' signifies 2 of all within the paren thesis. The oxygen ratio of the part in the parenthesis is 1 : 1, there being J- Ca3 to i Sl ; the O. ratio for Ca, Sl, Si, in the formula, is 1 : 1 : 2 ; and for Ca+Sl Si it is 1 : 1. Thus the two formulas here explained express identical^p- the same consti tution. There are many compounds allied to the above, for example : (i-Mo-'+A Sl)- si3 (i \u00a3V+\u00a3 Sl)'1 Si3, (\u00a3 Mg3+\u00a3 Fe)2 Si3, etc. The symbol R is used, in the manner above\" explained, in writing a general formula for the group containing these and other re lated compounds; as (J R3+\u00a3 fi)2 Si3. So E O is a general symbol for any carbonate of a protoxyd \u2014 whether of lime, magnesia, oxyd of zinc, or any other base. 11. In the preceding table, and throughout this volume, except under the sulphur compounds, As, Sb, Bi, Ni, P, in formulas under the old system, would be more correctly written As2, Sb2, Bi2, Ni,, Pp-, or As, Sb, Bi, 5-H, P. The atomic weights of these elements in the table are double the value which is often given them in the old system."], [23, "INTRODUCTION. XV ' 12. Binary compounds are those consisting of elements of two kinds, those of one kind negative to the other : e. g., magnesia, Mg 0, consisting f magnesium and oxygen ; water, H 0 ; silicic acid, or silica, Si O2 ; pyrite, Fe S2. Ternary compounds (called also salts and double binaries) consist of elements of three lands, (1) basic, (2) acidic, (3) acidific. Thus a silicate of lime and magnesia (or calcium and magnesium) contains (1) calcium and magnesium, (2) silicon, (3) oxygon; sulphate of lead contains (1) lead, (2) sulphur, (3) oxygen; the sulphanti monite, jamesonite, contains (1) lead and iron, (2) antimony, (3) sulphur. 13. Polymeres are distinct substances that are atomically multiples of a common type. Thus the compounds 2 O H2, 3 6 H2, 4 G H2 (generally written G2 H4, G3 H\", & H\"), are polymeres of G H2. 14. The following principle is of great importance in connection with the chemical constitution of inorganic compounds, and although explained briefly elsewhere (pp. 1-3 and 202), deserves to be formally stated in this place : The replacing power of the elements is in proportion to their combining power, this combining power being reckoned in number of atoms of oxygen (or sulphur, or the acidific element, whatever it may be). The line A, below, contains the formulas of the different kinds of oxyds ; B, the same, divided each by its number of atoms of oxygen (that is, severally, for the suc cessive members, by 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4), by which division they are reduced to the protoxyd form ; C, the basic elements without the oxygen : A. EO E20' EO2 B. EO RfO EiO C. E EJ Ri R-O' EO3 E**0' EO' E.*0 Eio E?0 EJO El Bi* E^ Ri \u25a0**. *- According to the above law, the R, R ', R-, etc., in the last line are mutually replace able, 1 for 1, although in atomic weight there is a variation from 1 to \\. They represent different states in which elements may exist, and have, to a certain extent, independent element-like relations. In some cases, as in iron, four of these states are represented in a single element, the compounds (1) Fe O, Fe S, (2) Fe2 O3, (3) Fe S2, (4) Fe O3, containing this metal in the four states Fe, Fe*, Fe* Fe\\ These different states of elements are best designated in the symbol by the letters of the Greek alphabet, as thus the confusion arising from the conflicting numbers for atomic weights and combining relations are avoided. The above lines A, B, C, thus wi'tttn, will become : A. aEO 3/?E0 2,E0 B. aRO (3E0 yRO 0. aE 0~R yE 5JE0 3iRO 7\u00a3RO 4,KO ,!R0 eEO -|e0 iEO \u2022JE tE \u00a3E \u00bbR In each table the line B is like C, except in the addition of 0 ; and the line A is equivalent to B multiplied for the successive members by the number of atoms of oxygen in the oxyds, that is, severally, by 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4. Examples of the use of these symbols are unnecessary here, as they occur on the pages referred to, and throughout thc volume. 15. In the statements of analyses throughout this volume, the use of brackets enclosing figures implies that the substance referred to was determined by the loss. New System of Chemistry. In the new system of Chemistry many of the elements have their atomic weights of double the value given in the preceding table, and their symbols are accordingly written with a barred letter, as follows :"], [24, "XVI INTRODUCTION. 16.

In the combinations between elements of the former series occur, hydrogen being taken as the unit, the ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 5 ; and, with reference to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, these elements are called perissads. \"While in the combinations between elements of the latter series occur, taking the same unit, the ratios 2 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 6 ; and these, in view of the even numbers, are called artiads. The words irepHfgic. and ap-noj were the words for odd and even numbers in ancient arithmetic. 18. As oxygen is one of the doubled elements, a protoxyd of a perissad must con tain 2 of the latter ; and water, accordingly, has the formula H2G, potash K2G, soda Na2G, etc. But the protoxyds of elements ofthe other series have simply the sym bols MgO for magnesia, GaG for lime, etc. 19. In the formulas of the salts, or ternaries, instead of dividing the oxygen between the acidific and basic elements (thus making the acid and base in the com pound distinct, as in the old system), the symbol of each of the elements is placed separately. Thus, Mg-'Si becomes Si Mgp, G4 ; or, in the method of writing adopted in this work, Si|\u00a9\u00ab||Mgs. 20. It is held that in some classes of compounds only part of the oxygen serves to unite the acidic element (Si) to the basic. For example, for Mg Si the for mula is Si G|G2|Mg, only two of the three of oxygen being regarded as uniting oxy gen. To explain : 20. As silicon combines with 2G, and 2G are equivalent to 4 H ; and magnesia, o: any protoxyd, with IO, which equals 2 H ; the combining character of silicon is repro"], [25, "INTRODUCTION. XVII H H \\ / sented by Si , and that of magnesium by H \u2014 Mg \u2014 H, silicon having four bonds of H H attraction (being therefore a tetrad), and magnesium two (it being a dyad). Combi H HH _, \\ / \\ ning the two makes Si Mg. Substituting 0 for 2 H in the diagram, it becomes e / \\ v / \\ H HH 0=Si Mg ; in which only two 0 unite the Mg and Si, one 0 being combined 0 alone with the Si. Hence the form ofthe above formula, Si0|02[Mg. If the silica is combined with two of magnesia (using the language of the old sys tem), the diagram becomes HH HH 0 0 Mg Si Mg ; and, substituting oxygen as before, Mg Si Mg. Here \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / HH HH 0 0 all the oxygen is uniting oxygen, and the formula is accordingly Si|0-|Mg_. 21. The number of atoms of uniting oxygen is equal to the number of bonds of attraction in ihe basic or acidic element, according as the former or latter has the smaller number. If, in the case of a compound containing one of silica, the base is one of a protoxyd (on the old system), there are two bonds of attraction in the prot oxyd, and therefore 02 is the uniting oxygen, one 0 remaining with the Si. If the base is two of a protoxyd there are four bonds of attraction in the basic element (as well as the acidic), and the uniting oxygen is 0(. If the base is three of a protoxyd, or one of a sesquioxyd, the silica then has the smaller number of bonds of attraction, namely but/o-wr, and the uniting oxygen will be 04, tbe rest being united with the basic element And not the silicon ; and it cannot exceed this, however much the amount of base be increased, it being determined by the greatest number of bonds of attraction common to the two, the basic and acidic elements. With two of silica the bonds of attraction will be eight, and so on. 22. The rule above given may be also stated in terms of the oxygen of the base and acid in the old system : the number of atoms- of uniting oxygen is double the number of atoms of oxygen of the base, unless the number of atoms of the base is greater than that of the acid ; and in this latter case it is double the number of atoms of oxygen in the acid. In the former case the formula should have the non-uniting 0 after the symbol of the acidic element (after Si in a silicate, S in a sulphate, etc.) ; in the latte\", it is written after that of the basic element. In the former, the acidic element makes the left part of the formula ; in the latter the formula is turned about, and it makes the right part. See for examples of the latter, p. 362. 23. For the sulphur, selenium, and tellurium compounds (that is, sulphids, etc.), the formulas are like those of the oxygen compounds, except that S, Se, or 5e is substituted for 0. So also for ternary fluorids. In some oxygen compounds (topaz, etc.) 0 is replaced in part by Fa (or, as the symbol for fluorine may then be written, 3?) ; and in a few others, by Cl2. 24. In the new system the expressions on p. xv, /3R, yH, <5R, eR, etc., become 6ft, yft, \u00abft, tft ; or, in the case of perissads, /3R2, yRj, etc. As, _Ss, and B of the old system become As2 0s, and B_ 03 in the new, and As and B are not monads, these formulas are equivalent under the new system to 3 /3As 0, 3 0B0. 25.

The atomic weights of the sulphur and arsenic groups in the new system are relatively the same with those that are used in the sections beyond on the Sulphids, those of the arsenic series employed in these sections being half less than are given in the table on pages xii, xiii. 1. 26.

The spinel formula written, as ordinarily done under the new system, without the Greek symbol, would be (ft+ft2)04. But this formula contains the fiction of 2 ft in ft2 03 ; when, in fact, while there are 2 ft in atomic weight, there are actually 3 ft in replacing power, as already explained (p. xv). Some additional sign is therefore required to make the formula tell the truth, and this is afforded either by adding other numbers to the barred letters, or by the use of the Greek letters as here adopted. 30.

In the descriptions of the physical characters of minerals, H. stands for hard ness, and G. for specific gravity. 2. The scale of hardness is as follows, crystallized varieties of the minerals men tioned being meant : 1,Talc; 2, Gypsum; 3, Calcite ; 4, Fluorite ; 5, Apatite ; 6, Orthoclase ; 7, Quartz ; 8, Topaz ; 9, Corundum ; 10, Diamond. 3. In crystallized minerals of the Isometric system, the physical characters are the same in the directions of the three axes, and in the directions of lines situated sym metrically with reference to these axes. In the Tetragonal and Hexagonal systems, these characters in a vertical direction differ from those in a horizontal or transverse. The optical axis has the direction of the vertical axis. 4. In crystals of the remaining systems there are two axes of polarization. A line bisecting the acute, or the obtuse, angle between these optical axes is called a bisec trix ; that bisecting the acute angle is the acute bisectrix, or the bisectrix, as the term is employed in the descriptions beyond ; that bisecting the obtuse angle (and which is at right angles to the acute) is the obtuse or conjugate bisectrix. 5. In the Orthorhombic system, the two bisectrices are parallel io the crystallo graphic axes ; and, consequently, the plane of the optical axes (the optic-axial plane) is parallel to one of the diametric sections of the crystal, and is at right angles to the other two. By a diametric plane or section, as here used, is meant a plane passing through any two of the crystallographic axes ; that is, one through each a and b, a and c, oi b and c. 6. In mineral species, the position of the bisectrix is constant, or nearly so, while the optic-axial angle often varies widely. The angles mentioned in the descriptions are those taken in the air, unless it is otherwise stated. 7. Under Blowpipe characters, B.B. stands for before the blowpipe; O.F. for oxydizing flame ; R.F. for reducing flame. A closed tube is a small glass tube closed at one end."], [29, "INTRODUCTION. XXI The following is the scale of fusibility adopted (that of von Kobell) : 1, Grai Antimony ; 2, Natrolite ; 3, Almandine (var. of -garnet) ; 4, Green Actinolite 5, Orthoclase ; 6, Bronzite. 4. Crystallography. 1 . The systems of crystallization are as follows : 1. Having the axes equal. The Isometric system. 2. Having only the lateral axes equal. The Tetragonal and Hexagonal. 3. Having the axes unequal. The Orthorhombic, Monoclinic, and Triclinic. The names Monometric, Dimetric, and Trimetric, used in former editions of this work, hava been set aside for the above for two reasons: (1) the fact that the naines waDt nrecision, the"], [30, "INTRODUCTION. XXII hexagonal system being as much dimetric as the tetragonal, and the monoclinic and triclinic as much irimetric as the orthorhombic*; (2) the desire to promote uniformity in the language of science. The names employed appear to be the best that have been proposed, and those most generally used ; and hence those that have the best claim for universal adoption. A. Isometric System. 2. Some of the simpler isometric forms are represented in figures 1 to 50. Fig. 1, a cube (with three equal axes) ; 2, an octahedron (or regu lar octahedron) ; 3, a dodecahedron (or rhombic dodecahedron) ; 4, 5, combination of cube and dodecahedron ; 6, 7, cubo-octahedron ; 8, combination of octahedron and dodecahedron (by noting the lettering, like planes being lettered alike through out, the several combinations are easily read off); 10, a trapezohedron (24-faced solid); 15, id., another variety ; 31, a tetrahedron; 47, 48, the pentagonal dodeca hedron in different positions. 3.

Fig, 50 represents a common twin or compound crystal in the isometric system ; and 50a illustrates that it corresponds to an octa hedron cut across the middle parallel to an octahedral face, with one half revolved 60 or 180 degrees. B. Tetragonal System. (Also called Quadratic, Pyramidal, Monodi metric, Diraetric, Zwei-und-einaxige.) 5. In the Tetragonal system 50A the lateral axes (6) are equal, being the diameters or diagonals of a square, while the vertical (a) is either longer or shorter than the lateral. 6. Owin\"* to the square form, the planes of a kind are in fours or eights. The like planes on the four solid angles make a 4-sided pyramid, and those of the two extremities combined a square octahedron. For any species one such octahedron may be assumed to have the vertical axis la ; and then the other octahedral planes on the same angles, with shorter or longer vertical axes, have the vertical axis a mul tiple or submultiple of a ; as %a, \u00a7a, etc., 2a, |a, 3<i, etc. ; and the planes of such octahedrons are accordingly lettered 1, \\, $, 2, f, 3, etc. 7. So again like planes on the four edges of each base make an octahedron, but of an intermediate series, called the diametric, the planes being parallel to a lateral axis or diagonal. The vertical axis varies by simple ratios, as in the other series ; but in the lettering, as the planes are parallel to a lateral axis (and would therefore meet it only at an infinite distance), this parallelism is expressed by adding the letter :', initial of infinity. Thus \\-i, 1-i, 2-i, 3-i, etc. 8. With the lengthening of the octahedron in each series, the numeral becomes arger and larger, until the octahedron is merged in a vertical square prism, its planes parallel to the vertical axis. This parallelism, expressed by the letter i again, as just explained, gives for the lettering of the square prism of the first or fundamental series, tor /; and for that ofthe second or diametric, i-i. The figures on pages 277, 273, are examples of these forms, and also of the double 8-sided pyramids and 8-sided prisms which occur in this system. 9. The angles between the planes on the vertical edges and /, or i-i, are the same as those having similar symbols in the isometric system, noting only this difference in the lettering, that O in the cube is i-i in the square prism ; thus O A i-2 in the cube or other isometric form is the same with i-i a i-2 in the tetragonal system ; and so on. 10. The length ofthe vertical axis a is calculated from the supplement (S) of the angle O a \\-i. A line drawn vertically on the plane 1-i (f. 260, p. 277), that is, at right angles to the lower or upper side, is the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, the basal side of which triangle is parallel to a lateral axis 6, and the vertical parallel to the vertical axis a. These sides have the ratios, therefore, of the two axes ; and taking \u2022J=unity, a=tan A (or angle of triangle at base, or opposite a). This angle A equals the supplement of O a \\-i ; and therefore, calling this supplement S, a=tan S. 11. The value of the axis may also be obtained from the supplement (S1) of the angle O ' 1, by the equation : <z=tan SA sec 45\u00b0 ; whence log a=log tan S' \u2014 10*1505150. C. Hexagonal System. 12. This system differs from the Tetragonal in having three equal lateral axes (b) instead of two ; the vertical (a) is at right angles to the lateral (fig. A). 13. In the Hexagonal section of the system the symmetry of the crystals is by sixes and twelves, as in figs. A to D ; f. 440, p. 530 ; f. 527, p. 627. In f. B, 1 cor responds to a hexagonal pyramid of the fundamental series, and 1-2, i-2, 2-2, to similar pyramids of the intermediate series ; / is the hexagonal prism of the former series, and i-2 that of the intermediate prism. Z\"a/=120\u00b0, /a \u00a3-2=1 50\u00b0, i-2 a f-2, ov. J,=120\u00b0. 14. In the Rhombohedral section if the system, the planes 1, 2, 3, \u00a3, etc., are"], [33, "INTRODUCTION. XXV planes of rhombohedrons, having for the vertical axis lo, 2a, 3a, \u00a3\u00ab, etc., la being the value of the axis in the fundamental rhombohedron, (E) (figs., p. 6). The angle of a rhombohedron mentioned is always that over a terminal edge, as that between the upper planes R of figure 141, p. 141. On gradually shortening the rhom bohedron in fig. 141, it may become \u00a7R, \u00a3i?, and so on, till the length becomes 0, and the rhombohedron is reduced to a flat plane. Hence, staiting from this plane (which corresponds to the basal plane ofthe rhombohedron or hexagonal prism), the rhombohedron as it elongates reaches the form of fig. 141 ; and continuing the elongation, the vertical axis doubles, trebles, and so on, till finally it becomes infinite, and the rhombohedron is then a six-sided prism. If a diminution in length now commences by planes inclined to the opposite extremities of the vertical axis, these planes correspond to another series of rhombohedrons which are distinguished by a minus ( \u2014 ). The planes 0....i..l..2...I (or \u0153) ....\u2014 2..\u2014 1..\u2014 I* 0, lie in a single vertical zone. Figs. 550, 551, p. 670, represent the forms B, -\u00a3, -2, -|, 4, 13. 15. The value ofthe vertical axis a is obtained from the supplement: Of 0A1-2 (S) by the equation a=tan S. Of 0A1 (\u00a3') by the equation a=tan S'-j-sec 30\u00b0. The latter gives log a=log tan S' \u2014 10-0624694. D. Orthorhombic System. (Also called Rectangular, Prismatic, Trimetric, Ein und-einaxige.) 16. In the Orthorhombic system the three axes are unequal and intei sect at right angles; and the three diametric planes, or those containing the axes, are consequently rectangular in intersection. The annexed figure represents a rectangular prism with replaced edges and angles. 17. \u00ab, 6, c, are the axes, of which a is the vertical, b the shorter lateral or brachydiagonal, c the longer lateral or maerodiagonal. O is the basal plane of the prism ; i-i the larger lateral plane, parallel to the longer lateral axis ; i-i the smaller lateral plane, parallel to the shorter lateral axis. 18./ are planes on the edges of the rectangular prism, which when extended would form a vertical rhombic prism, having its axes b and c in the ratio of lo : lc. It is therefore the unit or fundamental vertical prism. 19. 1-Z are planes parallel to the longer lateral axis, and having for the axes a, b, the ratio la : lb; extended upwards they form a dome (so named from domus, a house), which is called the macrodome. The planes 1-i"], [34, "INTRODUCTION. XXVI in a similar manner form what is called a brachydome, they being parallel to th< shorter lateral axis; its axes a, c, have the ratio la : lc, that is, the two diagonals of this horizontal prism have this ratio. These two domes are therefore the unit domes Their summit angles are of course supplements of their basal angles (or those ovel the vertical planes i-i, i-i). 20. If the axis 6=1 ; half the obtuse angle of the prism / be called X; half the summit angle of the macrodome 1-i, Y, and half the basal ofthe same Z; then we have for the values of the other axes a and c : a=cot F\"=tan Z. c=tan X. Further, X=i-l a 2\u201490\u00b0 ; Y= 0 a 1-i\u2014 90\u00b0 ; Z=i-i a 1-i\u2014 90 20. The planes 1 on the eight angles are planes of an octahedron, having for the axes a, b, c, the ratio la : 16 : lc. It is therefore the unit or fundamental octahe dron (1). Its pyramidal edges, if the octahedron were completed (as in f. 55, p. 20), would be of two kinds, two at each extremity opposite to the axis c, the longer lateral axis, and two opposite to 6, the shorter lateral axis. The former is the maerodiagonal edge, the latter the brachydiagonal. 21. By doubling the length of the vertical axis, the lateral being fixed, we form the octahedron 2 ; by trebling it, the octahedron 3 ; by halving it, the octahedron \u00a3; and so for the domes, doubling the vertical axis we have the dome 2-i or 2-i ; by halving the same, the dome -J-i or \\-i, and so on. The letter i, as before explained, stands for infinity, and means that the plane is parallel to one of the axes ; i, that it is parallel to the longer lateral axis ; i, that it is parallel to the shorter lateral axis i or / alone, or as the initial letter in a symbol, signifies that the plane is parallel to the vertical axis. A plane i-i is parallel both to tho vertical and longer lateral ; i-i, both to the vertical and shorter lateral. 22. The octahedrons alluded to above have for the axes 6, c, the ratio 16 : lc, and belong to what is called the fundamental series. But others may exist with different ratios for 6 and c, and any value for a. If the ratio for 6, c, is 16 : 2c, then, as c is the longer lateral axis, if the vertical axis is la, the octahedron is 1-2 ; or if the vertical axis is 3a, the plane is 3-2 ; or if -Ja, it is So for the ratio 36 : lc ; if the vertical axis is la, the octahedron is 1-3 ; or if 2a, it is 2-3 ; and if the vertical axis is infinite, the plane is parallel to the vertical axis, and the sym bol is i-3. The first figure or letter in these symbols always refers to the vertical axis, and the second to one of the lateral axes. 23. The planes may thus be viewed as lying in vertical zones, a different zoDe for every ratio of the lateral axes 6 : c. Each series, or zone, terminates above in the basal plane of the prism, for which a=0, and below in a vertical prism, for which a is infinite. By taking the planes i-i, i-i, successively, for the basal plane O, there may be similar series of zones for each. The planes of a zone have their mutual intersections parallel to one another ; and wherever a series of planes exists having such parallel intersections, the series is called a zone. The small tables inserted in connection with the crystalline forms of some of the species of this and other systems of crystallization (pp. 27, 35, 338) consist of the vertical zones of occurring planes. The planes of a vertical zone have mutual hori zontal intersections in the crystal. Consequently in a crystal not oblique the inclina tion of the basal plane, O, on any plane in a zone, subtracted from 270\u00b0, gives the inclination of the prismatic plane of the same zone on that plane, and the tangents of the supplemental angles of O on the planes of a zone vary as the coefficient of the vertical axis for each plane. Thus, suppose there are the planes 1-i, 2-i, 3-i, take the supplement of 0 a\\-i (which, if Oa\\-i is 124\u00b0, equals 180\u00b0 \u2014 124c=56;); then the tangent of this angle, doubled, will be the tangent of the supplement of 0 a 2-i, and trebled, of the supplement of the angle of O i 3-i. The same for the"], [35, "INTRODUCTION. XXVII planes 1, 2, 3, or 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, and so on ; and if ii be made the base, then in the same manner the angles may be calculated for similar zones of planes terminating in i-i ; oi if i-i be made the base, for zones of plaues terminating similarly in i i. So if the angles are given, the relations of the axes may be calculated by reversing the process 24.

(Also called Hemiprismatic, Clinorhombic, Monoclinohe dral, Zwei-und-eingliederige.) 25. In this system two of the axial intersections are rectangular, and one is oblique. In other words, the lateral axes are at right angles to one another ; but one is oblique to the vertical axis, and the other at right angles to it. 26. If figure E on page xxv be taken as representing a monoclinic form in its usual position, thpn a will be the vertical axis ; 6 the inclined lateral, called the clino diagonal ; c the other lateral, called the orthodiagonal. The angle a a 6, or the inclination of the vertical axis, is called the angle C. 27. The section of the crystal in which 6, the clinodiagonal, and a lie is the clino diagonal section ; and that iu which c and a lie is the orthodiagonal section. The vertical plane i-i, of f. E, is parallel to the orthodiagonal section, and is lettered simply i-i ; and the plane i-i, of the same figure, is parallel to the clinodiagonal section, and is lettered i-l. The angle 0 Ai-i=C, or the inclination of the vertical axis; while Oa i-i=Q0~, and i-i a -'-*.=90\u00b0. The clinodiagonal section is the plane of symmetry. 28. The domes having the planes parallel to the clinodiagonal are called clinodotnes, and arc lettered with an accent over the i, thus, 1-t (1-i in f. E), 2-i. 29. The domes parallel to the orthodiagonal are hemidomes, the planes in front at top being unlike in inclination those in front below, each being a hemidome \u25a0 one series is opposite the acute intersection of the axes, and is the plus series, lettered 1-i, 2-i, etc. ; the other is opposite the obtuse, and is lettered -1-i, -2-i, etc. 30. The octahedral planes are all hemioctahedral, and + and \u2014 are used in the svmbols in the same manner as in the symbols of the hemidomes. Thus in fig. E, if the angle between the upper 0 and the front plane i-i is obtuse, then the upper planes 1, 1, in front would be -1, -1, and the corresponding planes below, -fl, +1, written usually 1, 1. 31. If the clinodiagonal 6=1 ; half the front angle of the prism / (over i-i) be called X, half the summit angle of the clinodome 1-i, X ' ; the supplement of i-i a 1-j (=0Al-i \u2014 C) be called and supplement of 0 a 1-i fee v; aud C be used as above explained ; then, c=sin C tan X. o,=c-\u00b1- sin 0 tan X'=sin v -7- sin /j.=sin ( 0 \u2014 X) -7- sin ja. F. Triclinic System. (Also called Doubly Oblique, Tetartoprismatic, Anorthic, Ein und-eingliederige.) 32. The three axes are unequal, and obliquely and unequally inclined. Angles of 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are not met with in Triclinic crystals. Examples, figures on pp. 297, -\u00b0.38, 349. 33. The crystallographic symbols used in this work are essentially those of Nau mann, the author of the system of crystallography which is followed. The only dif ference is that i, the initial of infinity, is substituted for the symbol oo, and the P is dropped,_it being in almost all cases unessential. Thus, P, 2P, 4P2, caPco, ooP, ooP2, 3p2, of Naumann, are P or 1, 2, 4-2, i-i, i (or /), i-2, 3-2, of this work. And in the rhombohedral section of the hexagonal system, for B, 2B, 3B, B~, 2B3, of Naumann, are here written, B, 2, 3, I3, 23. Moreover 0 or o is -written for the basal plane. The distinction of capital or small letter in the symbols is mathemati cally of no importance. 34. In the orthorhombic system the shorter lateral axis is made the unit in this work. The axes are lettered a, 6, c, in different systems, except in that of Miller (or"], [36, "XXVIII INTRODUCTION. properly Whewell's), who uses the letters h, I, Jc, as \" indices \" referring to the axes in the order here written : Vertical. Brachydiagonal. Maerodiagonal In this work abc In Naumann a c b In Weiss and Rose c a, 6 In Miller k I h For the tetragonal system the axes are the same, except that 6=c. In the mono clinic : Vertical. Clinodiagonal. Orthodiagonal Naumann and this work abc Weiss and Rose cab Miller k I h The following are 'convenient simple rules for use in connection with crystallo graphic measurements and calculations : 35. If a plane, p, replaces the edge between any other two, s, t, making parallel intersections, the sum of the angles between p and the two planes s, t, equals 180 plus the inclination of * on t. If the planes s, t, meet at 90\u00b0, the sum of these angles equals 180\u00b0+ 90\u00b0=270\u00b0 ; and if the angles are equal, each is 135\u00b0 ; if the planes s, t, meet at 110\u00b0, the sum ofthe two angles equals 180\u00b0 + 110\u00b0=290\u00b0 ; and if one is 130\u00b0, the other will be 160\u00b0. 36. On p. xxvi, the relation between the symbols and the tangents of the inclina tions of planes lying in zones between rectangular axes (which zones can be made to be vertical zones in one position or another of the crystal) is pointed out. The same method holds for ail vertical zones in the tetragonal system, and for those that be come vertical on putting the crystal on its plane i-i ; also for all the zones which are made vertical by placing a monoclinic prism on its face i-i, that is the zone of clino domes, the zone of vertical prisms, and all zones, then vertical, of hemioctahedrons ; also for all the vertical zones of the hexagonal prism, and hence for the zone of rhom bohedrons of any species, or vertical zones of scalenohedral planes. 37. For the transfer oi hi k of Miller's system into the system of this work, take the reciprocals. Thus if symbol is 212, the reciprocals are \\, 1, \\, the last \\ refer ring to the vertical axis. As the relation of the lateral axes should be in whole numbers, double the whole and it gives 1:2:1; whence the plane is that which would be here designated 1-2. So 1 : 1 : 3 becomes 1 : 1 :'-}>, whence the symbo \\ ; or 315 becomes \\, 1, \\, or 1, 3, J ; whence -f-3 ; and in the orthorhombic system the 3 in i-3 would have the short mark, or be written -f-3 ; while 135 would give the symbol 2-3. 38. In hexagonal forms the change is less simple, and the method for it is harrlly intelligible to one not knowing something of both systems. The axes of Miller, in stead of being those of fig. A, p. xxv, are lines drawn through the centre normal to (that is, at right angles to) thc alternate faces of the pyramid ; they are therefore three in number, and the planes are thus referred to axes parallel to the rhombohedral edge. The planes in fig. A, according to Naumann's system, are all of one kind in the hexagonal section of the hexagonal system, but of two kinds, B and -B (or 1 and -1) in the rhombohedral section. In Miller's system they are of two kinds in both sec tions, the distinction between the two sections not being entertained. The axes a, b, c, of any plane in the hexagonal system of Naumann, have the sol (owing values in terms of A k I of Miller :* * Furnished the author for this place by Prof. J. P. Cooke, of Harvard."], [37, "INTRODUCTION. XXIX a= 1 /3 (1 + 2 cos y) 1_ 1_ A + \u00c6+ZV 2(1\u2014 cos 7) b~l\u2014k c~l\u2014h But in using these equations strict attention must be paid to the signs, as it illus. tiated in the examples below. The angle y is the angle between the axes in MJler's system, which equals the facial angle of the rhomb face at the vertex of the rhombo iedron B. The equations give the true ratios of Naumann's axes ; but these ratios often have to be reduced to whole numbers, or otherwise modified, to obtain precisely the values used in Naumann's symbol. The second member in the equation for a gives the length of the axis ma in any form ; the first member in it is all that is required for the value of m in the symbol, while the second is the value of a. The following are some examples: In f. 564 (p. 672), plane It, which is 100 of Miller, gives, on substituting the values of h k I, and working the equations, a : b : c=l : i (infinity) : -1. The parameters ofthe plane in Naumann's system for the vertical and three lateral axes are 1:1:1:1*. The plane i, to the right, is 2TT of Miller ; whence a : b : c=i : i : -3, which, since a and b arc each infinity, is equivalent to i : i : \u2014 1. The plane -2, to the right, is 1T1 of Miller; whence a : 6 : c=l : } : i=2 : 1 : i; the Nau mann ratio for this plane is 2 : 1 : 1 : i. Plane -f is 332 of Miller; whence a : b : c=} : | : -i=f : -1 : -L The left upper plane I3 is 20T in Miller; whence a : b : c=l : -1 : -}=3 : -3 : -1, giving the Naumann symbol 3-3, from which comes its equivalent sealenohedral symbol Is. The left upper plane }3 is Miller's 310 ; whence a : l> : c=\u00a3 : -1 : -}=f : -3 : -1 ; giving the Naumann symbol f-3, and its equivalent }3. The right upper ofthe two adjoining planes, }3 in f. 564, is 301 of Miller; whence a : b : c= \u00a3 : 1 : -}. This is apparently a different result from the last. But calculating the length of the fourth of Naumann's parameters, it gives h=n-i-(n\u2014 1)=}-h(-}\u2014 ])=}, from which it follows that the parameters of the plane are } : 1 : } : \u2014 }; and on calculating the fourth parameter in the preceding, } would be obtained, proving that both are really the same plane. 5. Nomenclature. 1. The termination ites or itis (the original of ite) was used, according to system, among the Greeks, and from them among the Romans, in the names of stones, it being one of the regular Greek suffixes. It was added (as ite in these recent times'. to the word signifying a quality, constituent, use, or locality of the stone. Some of the examples are: H\u00e6matites, from the red color of the powder Chloritis, from the green color ; Steatites, from the greasy feel ; Dendritis, from a resemblance to a tree or branch ; Alabastritis, for the stone out of which a vase called an alabastron was made ; Basanites, from the word for touchstone ; Siderites, from the word for iron; Argyritis, from the Greek for silver; Syenitis, from the locality, Syene in Egypt ; Memphitis, for a marble from Memphis in Egypt. 2. The only modern kind of name not in vogue in Pliny's time is that after persons, Werner appears to have been the first to introduce personal names into mineralogy. The earliest example, as far as ascertained, was his naming what von Born had called Green Mica (Mica viridis), Torberite, paster its investigator, the chemist Torber Bergmann (more correctly written Torbernite by some mineralogists of last century, as Bergmann wrote his name in Latin, the language of his scientific works. Torbernus Bergmann). The name encountered objections ; and Werner, in view of Bergmann's announcement (after some incorrect trials) that the mineral was a copper ore, substituted in 17S9 the name Chalcolite. He, however, immediately afterward (early in 1790) showed that he saw nothing bad in the style of name by designating other new species Prehnite and Witherite, the former after Col. Prehn, the discoverer, and the latter after Dr. Withering, the discoverer and analyst of the species. The same year Estner, a mineralogist of Vienna, issued a pamphlet against the Werner school, with the title \"Freymiithige Gedanken"], [38, "INTRODUCTION. XXX iiber Herm Iuspeetor Werner's Verbesserungen in der Mineralogie \" etc. (64 pp. 16mo, 1 .90), :r which he makes light of Werner's labors in the science, and under tho head of Prehnite ridicubd this method of creating a paternity, and providing the childless with children to hand down their names to posterity (p. 25). Such names were, however, too easily made, too pleasant, as a general thing, to give and receive, and withal too free from real objection, to be thus stopped off, and they have since become numerous, even Vienna contributing her full chare toward their multiplication. . ,, ... .\u201e As a part of the history of mineralogical nomenclature, it maybe here added that Werner, when it was proved that his chalcolite was an ore of uranium with but little copper, instead of a true ore of copper, dropped the name entirely, and called the mineral simply Uranglimmer (Uranium mica); and Karsten, in his reply to Abbe Estner (Berlin, 1793, 80 pp. 12mo), makes out of the necessary rejection of chalcolite an argument against chemical names, and in favor of names after persons, as the latter could never turn out erroneous in signification. Werner, in an article written in defence of his introduction of this class of names (Bergm. J., i. 103, 1790), mentions the ease of Obsidian (more properly Obsian) as a precedent from Pliny, Obsian being, as Pliny states, the reported discoverer of the substance in Ethiopia. But this is not strictly an example. For Pliny uses Obsian not as a substantive, but as an adjective ; the mineral was not Obsian, but Obsian glass or Obsian stone ; vitrum obsianum, lapis obsianus, and obsiana [vitra], occurring in the course of the paragraph. The addition of the termination ite to Obsian would, aeeordiDg to mineralogical method, make a name equivalent to Pliny's lapis obsianus. Names of persons ending in an (as Octavian, Tertullian) were common among the Romans ; and this is so far reason for avoiding the termination in names of stones. Some critics question the existence of the reputed Obsius, and reject Pliny's explanation. 3. The ancient origin of this termination ite, its adoption for most of the names in modern mineralogy, its distinctive character and convenient application, make it evidently the true basis for uniformity in the nomenclature of the science. 4. If any other termination in addition is to be used, it should be so only under system ; that is, it should be made characteristic of a particular natural group of species, and be invariably employed for the names in that group ; and its use should not be a matter of choice or fancy with describers of species. As a matter of fact, several other terminations are in use, but wholly without reference to any such system. The most common of them is ine ; but it has not been employed for any particular division of minerals, and it could not now be so restricted ; it belongs by adoption and long usage to chemistry, and should be left to that science. 5. In order then that the acquired uniformity may be attained, changes should be made in existing names, when it can be done without great inconvenience. Names like Quartz, Garnet, Gypsum, Bealgar, Orpiment, with the names of the metals and gems, which are part of general literature, must remain unaltered. Mica and Feldspar, equally old with Quartz, have become the names of groups of minerals, and are no longer applied to particular species. Fluor was written fluorite last century by Napione. Blende, although one of the number that might be allowed to stand among the exceptions, has already given place with some mineralogists to Sphalerite, a name proposed by Haidinger (because blende was applied also to other species) in 1845, and signifying deception, like Blende. Galena was written Galenite by von Kobell some years since. Orthoclase, Loxoclase, Oligoclase might be rightly lengthened to Orthoclasite, etc. But the termination clase (from the Greek for fracture) is peculiar to names of minerals, and the abbreviated form in use may be allowed to stand for species of the Feldspar group. It seems better that it be avoided elsewhere. Many other examples will be found by the reader in the pages of this volume. In the course of the last century, when the science of minerals was taking shape, and progress iu chemistry was helping it forward, there was an effort on one side to introduce, under the .nfluenco of Linn\u00e6us, the double names of Botany and Zoology ; and on the other, under thu jifluence of Cronstedt and Bergmann, names expressive of chemical composition, as far as it was ascertained ; and the two methods have had their advocates till late in the present century. But,"], [39, "INTRODUCTION. XXXI al the same time, the necessity of single names was recognized by most of the early mineralo gists ; and in the spirit of the system which had made its appearance among the Greeks and Romans out of the genius of the Greek language, they almost uniformly adopted for the new names the termination He. Thus we have from Werner the name9 Torberite, Chalcolite, Graphite, Prehnite, Witherite, Bora cite, Augite, Pistacite, Pinite, Aragonite. Apatite, Leucite, Cyanite (Kyanite) ; and from other sources in the same century, Zeolite, Actinolite, Tremolite, Coccolite, Arendalite, Baikalite, Melanite, Staurolite, Lepidolite, Cryolite, Chiastolite, Collyrite, Agalmatolite, Sommite, Moroxite, Pharmaco lite, Strontianite, Delphiuite, Titanite, Ceylanite, Gadolinite, Rubellite, Sahlite, Wernerite, Scapo lite, Mellite, etc. The termination ine was also adopted for a few names, as Tourmaline, Olivine, Maseagnine, Serpentine ; and an in Vesuvian ; but the great bulk of the names were systematically termi nated in ite. With the opening of the present century (in 1801), Haiiy came forward with his great work on Crystallography, and in it he brought out a variety of new names that defy all system, having nothing of the system of the earlier science, and no substitute of his own. Forgetting that the unity of law which he had found in nature should be a feature of scientific language, he gave to his names the following terminations : ane, in Cymophane ; ase, in Euclase, Idocrase, Auatase, Dioptase ; aste, in Pleonaste ; age, in Diallage ; ene, in Disthene, Sphene ; gene, in Amphigene ; ide, in Staurotide ; ime, in Analcime ; ole, in Amphibole ; ome, in Aplome, Harmotome ; ose, in Orthose ; ole, in Actinote, Epidote ; yre, in Dipyre ; ype, in Mesotype. And the true mineralogical termination ite he admitted only in the few following : Axinite, Meionite, Pycnite, Stilbite, Grammatite. Haiiy had commanded so great and so general admiration by his brilliant discoveries iu crys tallography, and by the benefits which he had thus conferred on mineralogical science, that his names with their innovations were for the most part immediately accepted even beyond the limits of France, although a number of them were substitutes for those of other authors. Some of Werner's names were among the rejected; and a break was thus occasioued between German and French mineralogy, which will not be wholly removed until the rule of priority, properly restricted, shall be allowed to have sway. The substitutes among Haiiy's names in the 1st edition of his Crystallography (1801) are the fol lowing : Amphibole, for Hornblende of last century and earlier. Orthose. for Feldspar. Pyroxene, for Augite of Werner, and Volcanite of Delametherie. [Delametherie was a contem porary of Haiiy at Paris, the author in 1792 of an edition of Mongez's Manuel du Mineralogiste (after Bergmann's Sciagraphia) ; in 1797, of an ambitious speculative work entitled Theorie de la Terre, the first two volumes of which consisted of a Treatise on Mineralogy; in 1811, 1812, of Lecons de Mineralogie, in 2 vols., and for a number of years principal editor of the Journal de Phy sique. He gave offence to Haiiy by some of his early publications. Haiiy's mineral Euclase is described in full by Delametherie in the Journal de Physique for 1792 (some years in advan\u0153 of Haiiy's description of it), without crediting the name or anything else to Haiiy; but five year? later, in his Theorie de la Terre, he inserts the species with full credit to Haiiy.] Cymophane, for Chrysoberyl of Werner. Idocrase, for Vesuvian of Werner. Pleonaste. for Ceylanite of Delametherie. Disthene, for Cyanite of Werner. Anatase, for Octahedrite of de Saussure, aud Oisanite of Delametherie. Sphene, for Titanite of Klaproth. Nepheline, for Sommite of Delametherie. Triphane, for Spodumene of d'Andrada. Amphigene, for Leucite of Werner. Actinote, for Actinolite of Kirwan, and Zillerlhite of Delametherie. Epidote, for Thallite of Delametherie, Delphinite of de Saussure, and Arendalite of Karsten. Axinite, for Yanolile of Delametherie. Harmotome, for Andreolite of Delametherie. Grammatite, for Tremolite of Pini. Staurotide, for Staurolite of Delametherie, and Grenatite of de Saussure. And, later, Paranthine, for Scapolite of d'Andrada, and Rapidolite of Abildgaard. Part of the changes were made with good reason ; but others were wholly unnecessary Haiiy was opposed to names from localities, and hence several of the displacements. Ho objected also to names based on variable characters, and characters not confined to the species. Moreover, a9 his pupil, Lucas, observes (in giving reasons for rejecting the name Scapolite and substitur.ni; Paranthine), \" le vice du mot lite, qui s'applique a toutes les pierres, ne pouvoient plus conTenii a cette substance du moment oil elle seroit reconnue pour un espece.\" Haiiy's own names are"], [40, "INTRODUCTION. XXXII remarkable, in general, for their indefiniteness of signification, which makes them etymologicallj nearly as good for one mineral as another, and very bad for almost none ; as, for example, Dial. lage, which is from the Greek for difference; Analcime, from weakness in Greek; Orthose, from straight in Greek ; Epidote. from increase in Greek : Anatase, from erection in Greek, interpreted by him as equivalent to length; Idocrase, from I see mixture in Greek, etc. His name Pyroxene, which he defines hite ou ilranger dans le domaine du feu, is an unfortunate exception, as often remarked, the mineral being the most common and universal constituent of igneous rocks. Beudant succeeded Haiiy, and had the same want of system in his ideas of nomenclature. Find ing occasion to name various mineral species which till then had only chemical names, he adopted Haiiy's method of miscellaneous terminations, but indulged in it with less taste and judgment, and with little knowledge of the rules of etymology. In his work we find the termination ese, in Apherese, Aphanese, Neoctese, Acerdese, Mimetese ; ise, in Leberkise, Sperkise. Harkise (only German words Gallicized) ; Melaconise, Zinconise, Crocoise, Stibiconise, Uraconise ; ose, in Argy rose, Argyrythrose, Psaturose, Aphthalose, Rhodalose, Siderose, Elasmose, Exanthalose, Cyanose, Welinose, Disomose ; ase, in Neoptase, Discrase ; ime, in Tpoleime ; ele, in Exitele ; while names ending in ine are greatly multiplied. In Germany, the tendency lias always been to uniformity through the adoption of the termina tion ite. Breithaupt has been somewhat lawless, giving the science his Plinian, Alumian, Sardi nian, Asbolan, etc. ; his Castor and Pollux; Glaucodot, Homichlin, Orthoclase, Xanthocon, etc.; still, far the larger part of his numerous names are rightly terminated. Haidinger's many names are always right and good. 6. In forming names from the Greek or Latin the termination ite is added to the genitive form after dropping the vowel or vowels of the last syllable, and any follow ing letters. Thus, -is'Xaj makes niXavoj (melanos) in the genitive, and gives the name melanite. The Greek language is the most approved source of names. 7. In compounding Greek words the same elision of the Greek genitive is made for the first word in the compound, provided the second word begins with a vowel; if not, the letter o is inserted. Thus, from irup, genitive <xvp;'S (puros), and -~p&i; (orthos), comes pyrorthite ; and from the same and g-fvo.c (xenos) comes pyroxene. 8. The liberty is sometimes taken in the case of long compounds to drop a sylla ble, and when done with judgment it is not objectionable ; thus melaconite has been accepted in place of melanoconite. But magnoferrite (as if from the Latin magnus, great, and ferrum, iron), for a compound of magnesia and iron, or calcimangite for one containing lime and manganese, are bad. 9. In the transfer of Greek words into Latin or English, the x (k) becomes c, and i.ue u (u) becomes y. 10. In the formation ofthe names of minerals, the addition ofthe termination ite to proper names in modern languages (names of places, persons, etc.), or names of characteristic chemical constituents, is allowable ; but making this or any other sylla ble a suffix to common words in such languages is barbarous. 11. Names made half of Greek aud half Latin are objectionable ; but names that are half of Greek or Latin and half of a modern language are intolerable. 12. Law of Priority. The law of priority has the same claim to recognition in mineralogy as in the other natural sciences. Its purpose is primarily to secure the stability, purity, and perfection of science, and not to insure credit to authors. 13. Limitations of the Law of Priority. The following are cases in which a name having priority may properly be set aside : a. When the name is identical with the accepted name of another mineral oi \u201earlier date. 6. When it is glaringly false in signification ; as when a red mineral is declared in its name to be black ; e. g., Melanochroite (p. 630) ; or when a honey-yellow mine ral is made to be ashen ; e. g., Melinophane (p. 263). c. When it is put forth without a description. d. When published with a description so incorrect that a recognition ofthe mine ral by means of it is impossible ; and in consequence, and because also of the rarity of specimens, the same species is described under another name without th<\""], [41, "INTRODUCTION. XXX11. describer's knowledge of the mineral bearing the former name. When, on the con trary, a badly described but well-known old mineral is redescribed correctly, there is no propriety in the new describer changing the old name. According to this canon it might seem right that the name Emerylite should have been substi tuted for Margarite (p. 506). Yet margarite, though incorrectly described, was a species well known in cabinets, and Dr. Smith manifested his appreciation of the true interests of science\u2014 the end of all canons \u2014 in adopting the old name so soon as he had ascertained by further research the identity of his species with margarite. e. When the name is based on an uncharacteristic variety of the species. Thus Sagenite was properly set aside for Butile (p. 159). /. When the name is based upon a variety so important that the variety is best left to retain its original name ; particularly where this and other varieties of the species, introduced originally as separate species, are afterwards shown by investiga tion tc oelong to a common species. Thus, the earlier name Augite is properly retained as the name of a variety, and Haiiy's later name Pyroxene accepted for the group, as explained on p. 214. g. When a name becomes the designation of a group of species : as Mica, Chlorite. h. When the name is badly formed, or the parts are badly put together : as when the terminal s of a Greek word is retained in the derivative ; e. g., aphanese from dtpa-uri; \u2022 Melaconise from the Greek for black and xovis ; Bhodalose from the Greek for rose-colored and p5.Xo.tr (halos), the genitive of aX<r, salt. The last word is bad not only in termination but in wanting an h before the a, and strictly an o after the d. Also Siderose (spathic iron), Argyrose (silver glance), Chalcosine (copper glance), from, respectively, ffiSripo$, apyupos, -^aXxo's. The ancient Greeks showed us how the derivatives from these words should terminate by writing them Sidcritis, Argy ritis, Chalcitis. Ignorance or carelessness should not be allow-ed to give perpetuity to its blunders under any law of priority. i. When a name is intolerable for the reasons mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, as Harkise, from the German Haarkies (hair pyrites) .; Kupaphrite, from the German Kupfer schaum ; Bleinierite, from the German Blei-Niere. j. When a name has been lost sight of and has found no one to assert its claim for a period of more than fifty years ; especially if the later name adopted for the species has become intimately incorporated with the structure of thc science, or with the nomenclature of rocks. Thus, although Tliallite and Delphinite ante date Epidote, it is not for the good of science that Epidote should be thrown aside. But where a name has not this importance, and is unexceptionable, the law of priority may be allowed to have its course. The right to recognition, under this canon, where the names are those of the original describer of the species, is strong. But with regard to names introduced for well-known old species to replace earlier chemical or provincial names, the claim is feebler ; and if the names are not strictly according to rule, or are unsatisfactory in mode of publication, they may be more freely modified, abbreviated if desirable, or rejected altogether. Prof. Chapman's \"Practical Mineralogy,\" pub lished in England in 1843, affords examples of the latter kind, and has occasioned some embar rassment. The work was by an author at that time unknown in the science (tho preface says, an engineer, aud \" a very young man \") ; it was small, of limited circulation, and practical iu its object, and therefore one in which new names for old species would not naturally be looked for. Ir. 1845, Haidinger, then already a veteran in the science, the author of several works on mineralogy, and of numerous resea-ehes in its various departments, issued his \" Handbuch,\" in which also a number of old species were provided with mineralogical names. Through Chapman's publication Haidinger's Breithauptite is anticipated two years by Chapman's Harlmannite ; his Freieslebenite, by the latter's Donacargyrite ; his Chromite, by the latter's Chromoferrite ; his Cupri/e,hy Ruberile; and so on. Chapman's names have ever since remained unknown or forgotten ; while Haidinger's have had general aceeptanee among the mineralogists of Europe, and are now tho current names. It has seemed that, aster so long a period of oblivion, it would be doing to good tc science to dis c"], [42, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIV place the latter, and a useless endeavor to attempt it. The la \u00abr English Minera.ogies of Nicol] (1849), Brooke & Miller (1852), and Greg & Lettsom (1S5S), contain nono of Chapman's names. k. Where the adopted system of nomenclature in thc science is not conformed to. In accordance with this last principle, the author, believing that the system demands that the names of species should have as far as possible, as above explained, the common termination ite, has changed, accordingly, a number of the names in the course of this volume. 14. It has appeared desirable that the names of rocks should have some difference of form from those of minerals. To secure this end, the author has written the final syllable ite of such names with ay; thus Diorite, Eurite, Tonalite, etc., are written Dioryte, Euryte, Tonalyte. The y is already in the name Trachyte. The author has allowed Granite and Syenite to remain as they are ordinarily written. since they are familiar names in common as well as in scientific literature. See further, on Nomenclature, the excellent Mineral-Namen of v. Kobell. 6. Bibliography. The following catalogue contains the titles of the works which are referred to in the following pages, with their abbreviated titles. As the value of these references, and of the various historical conclusions deduced, depends on their having been derived from the original publications themselves, the abbreviated titles of the Jour nals and other works which the author has had by him for consultation are put in black letter; while the rest, that is of those he has not seen, arc in small capitals. Some titles also are added of works consulted, but not referred to. Many other titles might have been inserted, a considerable number from the author's library ; but they would swell the list without increasing much its value. The abbreviations of the more important words in the abbreviated titles, and of the names of the States in the United States (some of which are in the titles and other in the observations on minerals), are as follows : Abbreviated words. \u2014 Am., American ; Can., Canada ; Ch., Chemistry, Chemical, Chemie, Chimie ; Fr., French ; G., Geological, Geology, Geologie, Geologischen ; Germ., Germau ; J., Journal ; M., Mines ; Min., Mineralogy, Mineralogie, Mineralo gical ; pt., in part ; Q., Quarterly ; Se., Sci., Science ; Soc, Society ; ZS., Zeitschrift.

Car., South Carolina ; Tenn., Tennessee ; Va., Virginia ; Vt., Vermont. Other abbreviations - are explained below. The catalogue is divided into three parts: 1. Periodicals not issued by Scientific Societies ; 2. Publications of Scientific Societies; 3. Independent works or publications. In giving abbreviations ofthe publications of Societies, the name of the place where the Society is established is in all cases stated, and, for the sake of uniformity, it is made the last word iu the abbreviated title, a method which it were well if always followed. For the prominent journals, and the serials of some societies, the tiiii of publication of the successive volumes, or of the volumes of every successive fiv years, is stated.* * A very useful table, giving the date of publication of each volume of the journals here referred to, might easily be constructed from the facts stated.

Annotated Index to the Useful Metals and Metallic Ores. GOLD.\u2014 Native Gold (1).* Distinguished from all minerals it resembles by its flattening judei a hammer; its cutting like lead, although considerably harder; its resisting the action of nitric acid, hot or cold ; its high specific gravity. Gold also occurs in Gold Amalgam (11), Sylvanite (98), Nagyagite (99), Petzite (58A), and Cala verite (Supplement). Also sometimes in traces in Pyrite, Galenite, Chalcopyrite. Native Tellurium. PLATINUM.\u2014 IRIDIUM.\u2014 PALLADIUM.\u2014 Native Platinum (3), the source of the platinum of commerce, is distinguished by the same tests as gold; and it is mainly on account of its mal leability that it occurs in flattened grains or scales. Platiniridium (4) is another ore somewhat harder. Iridosmine (7) resembles platinum ; but it scratches glass, and gives the reaction of osmium, besides being rather brittle. Native Palladium (5). SILVER.\u2014 The important Silver minerals are : Native Stiver (2), sectile and malleable like gold, the only one that has a white color; Argentite or Sulphuret of Silver (40), blackish lead-gray, cutting (unlike the following) nearly like pure lead, cubic in crystallization; Pyrargyrite and Proustite or Ruby Silver ore (117, 118), ruby red to black, always giving a bright red powder; Freieslebenite or Gray Silver ore (114), steel-gray, rather brittle, and powder steel-gray ; Stephanitt or Brittle or Black Silver ore (130), iron-black, and giving an iron-black powder; Cerargyrite or Horn Silver (140), resembling a dark-colored gray or greenish wax, and cutting like wax; Embo lite or Chloro-bromid of Silver (141), like the last, but more greenish. These ores yield silver easily, when heated ou charcoal. Besides these, Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper (125) is often a valuable silver ore ; Galenite (44). which, although seldom yielding over seventy-five ounces to the ton, affords a considerable part of the silver of commerce. For other rarer silver minerals, see 35, 36, 41, 42, 58-60, 62, 63, 98, 99, 108, 111, 115, 116, 120, 131, 133, 142, 143. COPPER. \u2014 The more valuable species are : Native Copper (12); Chalcopyrite or Copper pyriks (78), of a brass-yellow color, scratched easily with the point of a knife-blade, and giving a greenish black powder; Barnhardtite (79) and Cubarute (77), which are similar to the last, but paler; Bornite or Purple Copper (49), pale yellowish, with a slight coppery tinge, but tarnishing exter nally to purple, blue, and reddish tints, easily scratched with a knife-blade, and powder grayish ; Chalcocite or Vitreous Copper (61), of a dark lead-gray color, and powder similar, resembling some silver ores, but yielding copper and not silver when heated on charcoal ; Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper (125), of a somewhat paler steel-gray color and powder; Bed Copper (172); Black Copper (17S) ; Malachite or Green Carbonate of Copper (751), of a bright green color, sometimes earthy in the fracture and sometimes silky; .izurite or Blue Malachite (752), of a rich deep blue color, either earthy or vitreous iu lustre. All the above are acted on by nitric acid, and the solution deposits a red coating of copper on a strip of polished iron ; Chrysocolla (346), a silicate of copper, resem bling the Green Carbonate, but paler green, and usually having a close texture (never fibrous), a smoother surface and somewhat waxy lustre, although occurring usually as an incrustation* Atacamite or Chlorid of Copper (153), of deeper green than Malachite; Sulphate of Copper (6691 For rarer minerals containing copper, see 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 46, 50, 51, 62, 80, 82, 100-103, 110, 119, 121, 124, 126, 154 (sulphids, arsenids, etc.); 218, 345 (silicates); 533-536, 538-548,567, 583, 615, 622, 623, 636, 639, 644, 665, 670, 700, 705, 706, 708 (phosphates, arsenates^ sulphatss); 750, 755 (carbonates). QUICKSILVER. \u2014 The only valuable ore is Cinnabar (64) of a bright red to brownish-black color, with a red powder, and affording quicksilver when heated in an open tube. There are also Native Quicksilver (8) ; Amalgam (9) ; Selenid (65); Chlorid and Iodid (136, 144). Tetrahedrite (125) sometimes contains this metal. LEAD. \u2014 Galenite (44) is the only abundant lead ore ; it is a lead-gray, brittle ore, yielding lead when heated with charcoal. The carbonate (cerussite, 729), phosphate (pyromorphite, 493), arse nate (mimetite, 494), and sulphate (anglesite. 633), are rarely worked as ores. For other lead minerals, see 41, 45, 46, 47, 99, 105-107, 111-114, 119, 122-124, 126, 128, 129 (sulphids, antimo nids, etc.); 145, 150-152 (chlorids) ; 177, 197 (oxyds); 502, 539 (arsenates); 505 (antimonate); 556 (phosphate); 616 (tungstate); 617 (molybdate); 619-621, 023 (vanadates); 635, 636, 638, Ell, 700 (sulphates); 642-645 (chromates); 712 (selenate); 715, 733 (carbonates). * The numbers refer to the number of the species."], [55, "xlvii raTKODCCTION. ZINC. \u2014 The most important ores are: 1, Smithsonite or Carbonate of Zinc (723), and 2, Cola mine or Silicate of Zinc (361) ; they are alike in a white, grayish-white, or greenish-white color, commonly a slight waxy lustre and smooth look (often stalactitic or mammillary). yet sometimes earthy ; and a hardness such that the surface is scratched with a knife-blade with some little difficulty. They differ in their action with muriatic acid ; when the surface is drusy, the silicato shows projections of minute rectangular prisms. Zincite or Red Zinc Ore (176) is also important ; it is bright red and very distinctly foliated. Blende or Sulphid of Zinc (56) is a common ore, hav ing a yellow to black color and resinous lustre, and distinctly cleavable ; the black varieties are sometimes a little metallic in lustre, but the powder is nearly or quite white. For other Zinc minerals, see IS5, 188 (oxyds); 70 (sulphid); 57 (oxysulphid) ; 238, 241, 266, 270 (silicate); 634, 666 (sulphate) ; 500 (phosphate) ; 530, 537 (arsenate) ; 749, 750 (carbonate)X COBALT, NICKEL.\u2014 The ores of cobalt: Smaltite (83) and Cobaltite (85), both of nearly a tin white color, with the powder grayish-black, color sometimes verging slightly to gray. The Black Oxyd of Cobalt (218), a kind of bog ore and very impure, is sometimes sufficiently abundant to be valuable. The useful ores of nickel are Chloanthite or the niccoliferous smaltite (83), Gersdorffite or Nickel Glance (86), Niccolite or Copper Nickel (71), distinguished by a pale copper-red color, and Niccoliferous Pyrrhotite (68), from which the larger portion of the nickel of commerce is extracted. For other ores of Cobalt, see 53, 81, 82, 84, 95, 97 (sulphids and arsenids) ; 618 (molybdate); 667 (sulphate); 526, 529, 530 (arsenate); 748 (carbonate); of Nickel, 54, 66 (sulphid); 74, 87, 88 (arsenical or antimonial); 416 (silicate); 668 (sulphate); 527, 529, 530 (arsenate) ; 747 (carbo nate). MANGANESE. \u2014 Common, as Pyrolusite (199) and Psilomelane (217), both black or grayish black ores, and having little lustre, and a blackish streak or powder, in which last particular they are distinct from the iron ore called Limonite, with which they are often associated, aud also from Hematite or Specular Iron. Wad (218) is an earthy bog mauganese, sometimes abundant and valuable. Manganite (205) is abundant in certain mines, but is of little value in the arts, because of its containing so little oxygen (one-third less than Pyrolusite), to which fact Beudant alludes in his name for the species, Acerdese; it differs from pyrolusite in its reddish-brown powder. For other manganese ores, see 52, 76 (sulphid); 73 (arsenid) ; 195, 196 (oxyds); 241, 262, 263 269, 491 (silicates); 498, 499, 531 (phosphates); 532 (arsenate); 663, 679, 6S0 (sulphates); 717, 721, 722,725 (carbonates). CHROMIUM. \u2014 Chromic Iron (189), a grayish-black, little lustrous ore, occurring mostly in Ser pentine, is the source of chrome in the arts. For different chromates, see p. 614. IRON. \u2014 The important iron ores are : Hematite or Specular Iron (the aiitarirris or bloodstone of Theophrastus) (180), characterized by its blood-red powder, and occurring either earthy and red, or metallic and dark steel-gray; in the latter condition very hard, a knife-point making no impres sion ; Magnetite or magnetic iron ore (186), as hard as the preceding, but having a black powder, and being attractable by a magnet; Franklinite, an allied species, containing zinc and manganese (18S); Limonite, called also brown hematite (206), a softer hydrous ore, affording a brownish yellow powder, earthy or semi-metallic in appearance, and often in mammillary or stalactitic forms ; nearly related to limonite are gothito (204), turgite (202), and limnite (213) ; Siderite or Spathic Iron (721), a sparry ore, of grayish, grayish-brown, aud brown colors, very distinctly clea vable, turning brown to black on exposure. The common clayey iron ores are impure ores, either of Spathic Iron, Limonite, or Hematite ; when the last they are red ; when brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown to black, they may be either of the two former. One of the most common iron minerals is Pyrite or sulphid of iron (75), a pale yellow, brass-like ore, hard enough to strike fire with steel, and thus unlike any copper ore, and all similar ores of other metals. It is fre quently mined and utilized for the sulphur it contains. Marcasite (90) is similar, but is \"prismatic and often crested in its forms. Pyrrhotite or Magnetic Pyrites (68) is less hard and paler, or more grayish in color. Leucopyrite and Mispickel (91, 93, 94) are white, metallic, arsenical ores, some what resembling ores of cobalt. Menaccanite or Titanic Iron (181) resembles specular iron closely, but has not a red powder ; it is abundant in some regions. For other iron minerals, see 260, 284,334, 369, 435, 436, 467, 469 (silicates) ; 473-475 (columbates, tautalates); 498, 499, 524, 5*25, 553, 557, 558, 560, 567-570, 576 (phosphates, arsenates); 605 (borate); 610 (tungstate); 646, 662, 664, 665, 672, 675, 682-687, 692. 696 (sulphates); 717, 719, 720 (carbonates); 758 (oxalate). TIN. \u2014 The only valuable ore is the Oxyd of Tin or Cassiterite (192), a very hard and heavy mineral of a dark brown to black color, sometimes gray or grayish-brown, without any metallic appearance ; the crystals usually have a very brilliant lustre. Tin also occurs as a sulphid (80) and is sparingly found in ores of tantalum and some other mineral species."], [56, "xlviii INTRODUCTION. TITANIUM.\u2014 The only ore of this metal of any value is Rutile (193). ARSENIC. \u2014 Native Arsenic (17) is one source of arsenic, but it is too rare to be of much avail also Orpiment (27), a sulphur-yellow, foliaceous, and somewhat pearly mineral, and Realgar (26) bright red and vitreous. Arsenic is mostly derived for the arts from the arsenical ores of iron cobalt, and nickel. ANTIMONY. \u2014 Stibnite or Gray Antimony (29) is the source ofthe antimony of commerce. II i3 a lead-gray ore, usually fibrous or in prismatic crystals, and distinguished from a similar ore of mangauese by its perfect diagonal cleavage aud its easy fusibility. Native antimony (18), senar montite (220), valentinite (221), are sometimes found in sufficient abundance to be mined. Anti mony occurs also in numerous ores of lead, silver, and nickel ; also as oxysulphid (226). BISMUTH.\u2014 Native Bismuth (20), the source ofthe met.al in the arts, is whitish, with a faint reddish tinge, has a perfect cleavage, and is very fusible. For other bismuth ores, see 30-33, 36, 102, 103, 121, 123, 124 (sulphids, tellurids); 222, 223 (oxyds); 336-338 (silicates); 753 (car bonate). 8. Abbeeviations.

Two series of elements are here recognized ; the first containing the more basic, and the second, one division of the more negative. These two series are parallel in their subdivisions, so that tha arrangement is a natural one, whether read across, or up and down, the page. The first group of each contains elements whose compounds have an odd number of atoms of the negative element, as 1, 3, 5, or the perissads (p. xviii); the other two of each, an even number, as 2, 4, 6, or the artiads. (IJ. To the Gold pgroup of elements belong also hydrogen, potassium, sodium, lithium, rubidium, c\u00e6sium, thallium; the atomic ratio for the oxyds is 1 : 1, and the general formula ofthe same RO, or R!0, in the new system of chemistry. To the Arsenic group belong the elements phosphorus, nitrogen, columbium, tantalum, and proba bly boron. In all but boron, there are oxyds containing 3 and 5 atoms of oxygen ; in boron, 3, but not 5. (2). To the Iron group of elements belong calcium, magnesium, aluminum, beryllium, copper cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium (in part), manganese (in part), leal (in part), etc. Among the oxyds, the atomic ratio 2 : 2 occurs iu the ordinary protoxyds, having the formula RO, as ordinarily writ ten (and so written in this work), but R0, in tho new style of chemistry. The ratio 4 : 6 is repre sented in the sesquioxyds, R2Os (S2\u00a93 in the new system). To the Sulphur group of elements belong also selenium, vanadium, and probably molybdenum, in Which the more prominent acid has the atomic ratio 2 : 6. Here also may be included that state of the metal chromium which exists in chromic acid (CrOs, or -Gr\u00a9*1), that of manganese in man ganic aeid, and that of molybdenum in molybdic acid. (3). To the Tin group belong also titanium, zirconium, thorium. The prominent oxyd has the atomic ratio 2 : 4 (RO2, or in the new system ft\u00a92). This group may contain also that state of lead which exists in the oxyd PbO2 (or Pb\u00a92) ; and the same also of manganese existing in MnO' of platinum and palladium in the deutoxyd state.* * The three states of a basic metal, corresponding to the protoxyd, sesquioxyd, and deutoxyd of the same (in which 1 part of metal balances, in its affinity, 1, 1^, and 2 parts of oxygen), may bs"], [59, "3 GOLD, The Carbon-Silicon Group contains Carbon a-nd Silicon. They are related to one another in the atomic ratio of their prominent acids (SiO2, CO2), but they are very widely unlike in many respects, aud very strikingly so iu the mineral compounds of the two acids.* Series III. \u2014 Besides the above two series of elements, there is a third, consisting of the emi nently negative elements (for the most part exclusively negative). The three groups of this Series III. are : (1). Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine. (2). Fluorine. (3). Oxygen. The first of these groups (like the same in Series I. and II.) includes elements of the odd divi sion ; the third of the even; while fluorine is of either. 1. GOLD. Sol. Alchem. Gediegen Gold Germ.

The word in Greek means also amber; and its use for this alloy probably arose from the pale yellow color it has as compared with gold. An argentiferous gold from the Ophir Mine, Nevada, pale yellowish m color, gave Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 169) G.=13-25, 13*68.

The average proportion of gold in the native gold of California, as derived from assays of seve ral hundred millions of dollars worth, is 880 thousandths ; while the range is mostly between 870 and 890 (Prof. J. C. Booth, of U. S. Mint, in a letter to the author, of May, 1867). The range in the metal of Australia is mostly between 900 and 960, with an average of 925. The gold of the Chaudiere, Canada, contains usually 10 to 15 p. c. of silver ; while that of Nova Scotia is very nearly pure. The Chilian gold afforded Domeyko 84 to 9si per cent, of gold and 15 to 3 per cent, of silvei (Ann. d. Mines IV. vi.). Porpezite afforded Berzelius (Jahresb. 1835) Gold 85*98, palladium 9*85, silver 4*17.

Observations.\u2014 Native gold is found, when in situ, with comparatively small exceptions, in the quartz veins that intersect metamorphic rocks, and to some extent in the wall rock of these veins. The metamorphic rocks thus intersected are mostly chloritic, talcose, and argillaceous schist of dull greeu, dark gray, and other colors ; also, much less commonly, mica and hornblendic schist, gneiss, diorite, porphyry ; and still more rarely, granite. A laminated quartzite, called itacolumite, is common in many gold regions, as those of Brazil and North Carolina, and some times specular schists, or slaty rocks containing much foliated specular iron (hematite), or magne tite in grains. The gold occurs in the quartz in strings, scales, plates, and in masses which are sometimes an agglomeration of crystals ; and the scales are often invisible to the naked eye, massive quartz tiiat apparently contains no gold frequently yielding a considerable percentage to the assayer. It is always very irregularly distributed, and never in continuous pure bands of metal, like many metallic ores. It occurs both disseminated through the mass of the quartz, aud in its cavities. The larger masses and the finer crystallizations are mainly in the latter ; and Prof. \"Wurtz has suggested that these have been formed by a slow aggregation and crystallization carried on through the solvent power, as regards gold, of persulphate of iron\u2014 this salt of iron being derived from the decomposition of the pyrite present in the quartz veins. The associated minerals are : pyrite, which far exceeds in quantity all others, and is generally auriferous; next, chalcopyrite, galena, blende, mispickel each frequently auriferous ; often tetrady mite and other tellurium ores, native bismuth, stibnite, magnetite, hematite ; sometimes barytes, apatite, fluor, siderite, chrysocolla. Tho quartz at the surface, or in the upper part of a vein, is usually cellular and rusted from the more or less complete disappearance of the pyrite and other sulphids by decomposition ; but below, it is commonly solid. The enclosing schists are sometimes soft and easily removed in mining. In other cases, they are excessively tough, and the quartz, being a brittle mineral yields the most easily to the drill. The gold of the world has been mostly gathered, not directly from the quartz veins, but from the gravel or sands of rivers or valleys in auriferous regions, or the slopes of mountains or hills, whose rocks contain in some part, and generally not far distant, auriferous veins; and such mines are often called alluvial washings ; in California placer-diggings. Pliny speaks of the \"bring ing of rivers from the mountains, in many instances for a hundred miles, for the purpose of washing the debris,\" and this method of hydraulic mining is now carried on in California on a stupendous scale. (See Silliman, in Am. J. Sci., II. xl. 10.) The auriferous gravel and earth have been derived from the disintegration or wearing down of auriferous rocks. The aurifer ous gravel beds in California are of vast extent; those of the Yuba, an affluent of Feather River, varying from 80 to 250 feet in depth, and averaging probably 120 feet. Most of the gold of the Urals, Brazil, Australia, and all other gold regions, has come from such alluvial washings. The alluvial gold is usually in flattened scales of different degrees of fineness, the size depend ing partly on the original condition in the quartz veins, and partly ou the distance to which it has been transported. Transportation by running water is an assorting process ; the coarser particles or largest pieces requiring rapid currents to transport them, and dropping first, and the finer being carried far away \u2014 sometimes scores of miles. A cavity in the rocky slopes or bot tom of a valley, or a place where the waters may have eddied, generally proves in such a region to be a pocket full of gold. In the auriferous sands, crystals of zircon are very common ; also garnet and kyanite in grains; often also monazite, diamonds, topaz, corundum, iridosmine, platinum. The zircons are sometimes mistaken for diamonds. Gold is widely distributed over the globe, and occurs in rocks of various ages, from the Azoic to the Cretaceous or Tertiary. The schists that contain the auriferous veins were once sediment ary beds of clay, sand, or mud, derived from the wear of preexisting rocks. Through some pro cess, iu which heat was concerned, the latter were metamorphosed into the hard crystalline schists, and at the same time upturned and broken, and often opeued between the layers : and then, all the fissures (cutting across the layers) and the openings (made between the layers, and therefore conforming with the lamination) became filled with the quartz veins containing gold. The quartz was brought into the intersecting fissures, and the interlaminated open spaces, from the rocks either side by means of the permeatiug heated waters (such heated waters, at a temper ature much above that of boiling water, having great decomposing aud solveut power, aud car rying into cavities whatever they can gather up from tho rocks). Thus, the gold of the veins was derived from tho rocks adjoining the openings, either directly adjoining, or above, or below it; and it must therefore have been widely .distributed through these rocks before they were crystal lized and the veins were made, although in so infinitesimal a quantity in a cubic foot, that the beds, without the metamorphism and the vein-making, would have been worthless mining ground. As schists with auriferous quartz veins were made in Azoic time, so were they also in Paleo zoic, especially at the great mountain-making epoch which closed the Paleozoic era; also late., il"], [63, "7 GOLD. the Jurassic period, as in the Sierra Nevada ; and still later in tho Cretact jus and Tertiary peri ods, as in the Coast Mountains of California. But whatever the age of thc schists and vein's, the original source of all the Paleozoic and later gold deposits must be the azoic or original rocks of the globe, as they are the great source of the material shales and sandstones of all subsequent \u25a0ages, excepting such as may have been derived from aqueous solution or chemical deposition. Auriferous quartz veins are in no case igneous veins \u2014 that is, veins filled by injection of melted matter from below. Gold exists more or less abundantly over all the continents in most ofthe regions of crystalline rock;!, especially those of the semi-crystalline schists ; and also in some of the large islands of the world where such rooks exist. In Europe, it is most abundant in Hungary at Konigsberg, Schemnitz, and Felsobanya, and in Transylvania at Kapnik, Vorospatak, and Offenbanya ; it occurs also in the sands of the Rhine, the Reuss, the Aar, the Rhone, and the Danube; on the southern slope of the Pennine Alps from the Simplon and Monte Rosa to the valley of Aosta ; in Piedmont; in Spain, formerly worked in Asturias; in many of the streams of Cornwall; near Dolgelly and other parts of North Wales ; in Scotland, in considerable amount, near Leadhills, and in Glen Coich and other parts of Perthshire; iu the county of Wicklow, Ireland; in Sweden, at Edelfors. At the Transylvania mines of Vorospatak, where one piece of 22 ozs. was found, the gold is obtained by mining, and the mines have been worked since the time of the Romans. The Rhine has been most productive between Basle and Manheim ; the sauds, where richest, contain only about 56 parts of gold in a hundred millions ; yet sands containing less than half this proportion are worked. The whole amount of gold in the auriferous sands of the Rhino has been estimated at $30,000,000 ; but it is mostly covered by soil under cultivation. In Asia, gold occurs along the eastern flanks of the Urals for 500 miles, and is especially abun dant at the Beresov mines near Katharinenburg (lat. 56 ~ 40' N.); also obtained at Petropavlov ski (60\u00b0 N.) ; Nischne Tagilsk (59\u00b0 N.) ; Miask, near Slatoust and Mt. Ilmen (55\u00b0 N, where tha largest Russian nugget was found), etc. Katharinenburg is the capital of the mining district. The Urals were within the territory of the ancient Scythians ; and the vessels of gold reputed, according to Herodotus, to have fallen from the skies, were probably made from Uralian nuggets. But the mines were not opened until 1819; soon after this they became the most productive iu the world, and remained so until the discoveries in California. They are principally alluvial washings, and these washings seldom yield less than 65 grains of gold for 4,000 lbs. of soil, and rarely more than 120 grains. At Beresov, there are workings in the parent rock. Siberian mines less extensive occur in the lesser Altai, in the Kolyvan mining region (about 1,500 miles cast of Katharinenburg, near long. 100\u00b0 E., between the Obi and Irtisch, and 1,500 miles west of the other great Siberian mining region, that of Nertschinsk, which is between 135\u00b0 and 140\u00b0 E., east of L. Baikal) ; among the localities are Schlangenberg and Siranovski, noted for affording the electrum (aual. 26, 27). Asiatic mines occur also in the Cailas Mountains, in Little Thibet, Cey lon, and Malacca, China, Corea, Japan, Formosa, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the Philippines, and other East India Islands. In Africa, gold occurs at Kordofan, between Darfour and Abyssinia ; also, south of the Sahara In Western Africa, from the Senegal to Cape Palmas ; in the interior, on the Somat, a day's jour ney from Cassen ; along the coast opposite Madagascar, between 22\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 S., supposed by some to have been the Ophir of the time of Solomon. In South America, gold is found in Brazil (where formerly the larger part of the annual pro duce of the world was obtained) along the chain of mountains lying uearly parallel with the coast, especially near Villa Rica, and iu the province of Minas Geraes ; in New Grenada, at Autioquia, Choco, and Giron ; Chili ; in Bolivia, especially in the valley of the Rio de Tipuani, east of Sorata; sparingly in Peru. Also in Central America, in Honduras, San Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and near Panama ; most abundant iu Honduras, especially along* the rivers Guyape and Jalan, in Olancho, whde found also in tho department of Yoro, aud in Southern Honduras. In North America, there are numberless mines along the mountains of Western America, and others along the eastern range of the Appalachians from Alabama and Georgia to Labrador, be sides some indications of gold in portions of the intermediate Azoic region about Lake Superior. They occur at many points along the higher regions of the Rocky Mountains, in Mexico, in New Mexico, near Santa Fe, CerilloR, Avo, ete. ; in Arizona, in the San Francisco, Wauba, Yuma, and .*>ther districts ; in Colorado, abundant, but the gold largely in auriferous pyrites ; in Utah and Idaho. Also along ranges between the summit and the Sierra Nevada, in the Humboldt region and elsewhere. Also in the Sierra Nevada, mostly on its western slope (the mine3 of the eastern being principally silver mines). The auriferous belt may be said to begiu iu the Californian penin sula. Near the Tejon pass it enters California, and beyond for 180 miles it is sparingly aurifer ous, the slate rocks being of small breadth ; but beyond this, northward, the slates increase in extent, and the mines in number and productiveness, and they continue thus for 200 miles 07 more. Gold occurs also hi the Coast ranges in many localities, but mostly in too small quantities!"], [64, "8 DESCETPTIVE MINEEALOGT. to be profitably worked. The regions to the north in Oregon and Washington Territory and the British Possessions farther north, are at many points auriferous, and productively so, though to a less extent than California. The mines of California were first made known in 1849. They were for some years solely alluvial washings, but since 1852 quartz mining has been on the increase. The quartz veins are often of great size. Some in the \" Mariposa estate \" average 1 2 feet, and m places expand to 40 feet in breadth. North of Mariposa county, the auriferous gravel, which has everywhere been a principal source of the gold thus far obtained, is very extensive. The thick deposits, often semi indurated, arc now washed down by vast streams of water thrown by the pressure of a column of water of 150 scot, that do the work of running off the earth and gravel, and gathering the gold in an incredibly short time. Much of the auriferous gravel formation is under a covering of vol canic rock, either tufa or lavas, which has to be underworked, in one way or another, to get out the gold, making what is called table-mountain -mining; the flat tops of hard volcanic material giving a table-like look to the heights. (See J. D. Whitney's Geol. California; review of same in Am. J. Sci., II. xli. 231, 351, and B. Silliman, ib., xl. 1.) In eastern North America, the mines of the Southern United States produced before the Cali fornia discoveries about a million of dollars a year. They are mostly confined to the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, or along a line from the Rappahannock to the Coosa in Alabama. But the region may be said to extend north to Canada ; for gold has been found at Albion and Madrid in Maine ; Canaan and Lisbon, N. H. ; Bridgewater, Vermont ; Ded ham, Mass. Traces occur also in Franconia township, Montgomery Co., Pennsylvania. In Vir ginia, the principal deposits are in Spotsylvania county, on the Rappahannock, at the United States mines, and at other places to. the southwest ; in Stafford county, at the Rappahannock gold mines, ten mdes from Falmouth, in the Culpepper county, at Culpepper miues, on Rapidan river ; in Orauge county, at the Orange Grove gold mine, and at the Greenwood gold mines ; in Goochland county, at Moss and Busby's mines ; in Louisa county, at Walton's gold mine ; in Buckingham county, at Eldridge's mine. In North Carolina, the gold region is mostly confined to the counties of Montgomery^ Cabarrus, Mecklenburg, and Lincoln. The mines of Mecklenburg are principally vein deposits ; those of Burke, Lincoln, McDowell, and Rutherford, are mostly in alluvial soil ; the Davidson couuty silver mine has afforded gold. In Georgia, the Shelton gold mines in Habersham county have long been famous ; and many other places have been opened in Rabun and Hall counties, Lumpkin county, at Dahlonega, etc. ; arid the Cherokee country. In South Carolina, the principal gold regions are the Fairforest in Union district, and the Lynch's creek and Catawba regions, chiefly in Lancaster and Chesterfield districts; .also in Pickens county, adjoining Georgia. There is gold also in eastern Tennessee. In Canada, gold occurs to the south of the St. Lawrence, in the soil on the Chaudiere (where first found in 1835), and over a considerable region beyond, having been derived probably from the crystalline schists of the Notre Dame range (T. S. Hunt), which is properly a continuation of the mountains of New England and the Appalachians to the southwest. In Nova Scotia, mines are worked near Halifax and elsewhere. In Australia, which is fully equal to California in productiveness, and much superior in the purity of the metal, the principal gold mines occur along the streams in the mountains of N. S. Wales (S. E. Australia), and along the continuation of the same range in Victoria (S. Australia). It was discovered in N. S. Wales, near Bathurst, in the spring of 1851 ; and in August ofthe same year, the far richer deposits of Victoria became known. Some gold has also been obtained in Queensland, N. Australia, in the vicinity of Moreton bay. Prof. Booth states (in a letter to the author) that one lot of Australian gold worth about \u00a74,000, submitted to him in 1853, consist ed of grains from the size of a very largo pea to small sand, all of which were more or less per fect dodecahedrons. Gold also occurs in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land). In New Zealand, it has beeu found at Coromandel harbor, near Auckland, on the Northern island, and on the Middle island near Cook's Straits. Found also in New Caledonia. Masses of gold of considerable size have been found in North Carolina. The largest was dis covered in Cabarrus Co. ; it weighed twenty-eight pounds avoirdupois (\" steel-yard weight,\" equals 37 lbs. troy), aud was 8 or 9 inches long by 4 or 5 broad, and about au inch thick. The largest mass yet reported from California weighed 20 pounds. A mass consisting* of a congeries of crystals, and weighing 201 ozs. (value $4,000) was found in 1S65, in California, 7 miles from Georgetown, in El Dorado county. Iu Paraguay, pieces from 1 to 50 pounds weight were takeu from a mass of rock which fell from one of the highest mountains. Several specimens weighing 16 pounds have been found iu tho Ural, and one of 27 pounds ; and near Miask, in the valley of Tasehku Targanka, in 1842, a mass was detached weighing 96 pounds troy. This mass is now in the Museum of Mining Engineers at St. Petersburg. A mass sound recently in Australia, called the \" Blanch Barkley Nugget \" had the enormous weight of 146 lbs., and only 6 ozs. of it were gangue; and one still larger, from Ballarat, weighed 184 lbs. 8 ozs., and yielded \u00a38,376 10s. 6-i. sterling of gold. The yield of gold mines has very much increased in amount since the discovery of the minel"], [65, "9 SH.VEE. of California. The mines of South America and Mexico were estimated hy Humboldt, over SO years since, to yield annually $11,500,000, which much exceeds the present proceeds. Brazil has furnished about 17,500 pounds troy per year. It is estimated that, between 1790 and 1830, Mexico produced $31,250,000 in gold, Chili $13,450,000, and Buenos Ayres $19,500,000, making an average annual yield of $16,050,000. The Russian mines in 1 846 produced about $16,500,000 : and in 1851, $15,000,000. The yield of California in 1849, the first year after the dis covery of the gold, was \u00a75,000,000. It rapidly increased from that year until 1853, when it wa3 nearly $60,000,000. Since then it has diminished, and in 1866 the amount was but $27,000,000. Montana, Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada, raise the total from the United States for the year 1866 to $86,000,000, with \u00a720,000,000 besides of silver. Australia produced $60,000,000 for a number of years; but for 1863, 1864, 1865, the average was not above $30,000,000, one fourth to one-third of which came from the auriferous quartz. The gold is obtained from the auriferous quartz by pulverizing, and then treating the finely powdered quartz with mercury, a method well known to the ancients. This metal dissolves out the gold, producing an amalgam which, by straining and distillation, yields the gold. The auri ferous pyrite is first powdered, and then roasted iu an oven of peculiar construction until the sulphur is driven off. The residue, according to one process, pronounced the best, is treated with cldorine gas, and the metals thus converted into chlorids, of which the chlorid of gold is soluble. This is removed and then treated with protosulphate of iron, when the gold is deposited. According to another process, the residue is fused with litharge, and the gold is thus combined with lead, and afterward obtained from the lead by cupellation. By a third process, the aurifer ous pyrite, especially when cupriferous, is concentrated into a copper matt by partial roasting aud fusion ; the matt is then roasted, and the oxyd of copper taken up by dilute sulphuric acid, leav ing the gold and silver iu the residue. 2.

Obs.-Native silver occurs in masses, or in arborescences and filiform shapes, in reins traversing gneiss, schist, porphyry, and other rocks. Also occurs disseminated, but usually invisibly, in native copper, galena, chalcocite, etc. . * ..- -i ,-, The mines of Kongsberg in Norway, have afforded magnificent specimens of native silver One among the splendid suite from this locality in the Royal collection at Copenhagen^ weighs up. wards of 5 cwt, and recently two masses have been obtained weighing severally 2.8 and 436 pounds. The principal Saxon localities are at Freiberg, Schneeberg, and Johanngeorgenstadt ; the Bohemian, at Przibram, and Joachimsthal. A mass weighing 60 lbs. from the Himmelsfurst mine near Freiburg had G. = 10*840. It also occurs in small quantities with other ores, at An dreasberg, iu the Hartz; in Suabia; Hungary; at Allemont in Dauphiny; m the Ural near Beresof; in the Altai, at Zmeoff; and in some ofthe Cornish mine*. . Mexico and Peru have been the most productive countries in silver. In Mexico, it has been obtained mostly from its ores, while in Peru it occurs principally native. A Mexican specimen from Batopilas weighed when obtained 400 pounds ; and one from Southern Peru (mines of Huantaya) weighed over 8 cwt. During the first eighteen years of the present century, more than 8,180,000 marks of silver were afforded by the mines of Guanaxuato alone. In Durango, Sinaloa, and Sonora, in Northern Mexico, are noted mines affording native silver. In the United States it is disseminated through much of the copper of Michigan, occasionally in spots of some size, and sometimes in cubes, skeleton octahedrons, etc., at various mines. It has been observed at a mine a mile south of Sing Sing prison, which was formerly worked for silver ; at the Bridgewater copper mines, New Jersey ; in interesting specimens at King's mine, Davidson Co., N. C. ; at Prince's location, Lake Superior, Canada ; rarely in filaments with bary tes at Cheshire, Ct. In Idaho, at the \" Poor Man's lode,\" large masses of native silver have been obtained. In Nevada, in the Comstock lode, it is rare, and mostly in filaments ; at the Ophii mine rare, and disseminated or filamentous ; in California, sparingly, in Silver Mountain district, Alpine Co. ; in tho Maris vein, in Los Angeles Co. ; in the township of Ascot, Canada. The yiejd of the United States at the present time in silver is about $20,000,000. Alt\u2014 Pseudomorphs, consisting of horn silver, red silver ore, and argentite. 3. PLATINUM. Platina (fr.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 Infusible. Not affected by borax or salt of phosphorus, except in the state of fine dust, when reactions for iron and copper may be obtained. Soluble only in heated nitro muriatic acid. Acts slightly on the magnet ; this property has been supposed to depend on the amount of iron it contains ; but Kokscharof states that platinum masses from Nischne Tagilsk are magneti-polar, and attract iron filings far more strongly than the ordinary magnet. Obs. \u2014 Platinum was first found in pebbles and small grains, associated with iridium, osmium, palladium, gold, copper, and chromite, in the alluvial deposits of the river Pinto, in the district of Choco, uear Popayan, in South America, where it received its name platina, from -plata, silver. In the province of Antioquia, in Brazil, it has been found in auriferous regions in syenite (Bous singault). In Russia, where it was first discovered in 1822, it occurs at Nischne Tagilsk, and Goroblago dat, iu the Ural, in alluvial material ; the gravel has been traced to a great extent up Mount La Martiane, which consists of crystalline rocks ; in Nischne Tagilsk, it has been found with chro mite iu serpentine. Formerly used as coins by the Russians. Russia affords annually about 800 cwt. of platinum, which is nearly ten times the amount from Brazil, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo. The amount coined from 1826 to 1814, equalled two and a half millions of dollars. Platinum is also found on Borneo, which furnishes 600 to 800 lbs. annually ; in the sands of the Rhine ; at St. Aray, val du Drac ; county of Wicklow, Ireland ; on the river Jocky. St. Domin go ; according to report, in Choloteca and Gracias, in Honduras ; in California, in the Klamath region, at Cape Blanco, etc., but not abundant ; in traces with gold in Rutherford Co., North Carolina ; at St. Francois Beauce, etc., Canada East. Although platinum generally occurs in quite small grains, masses are sometimes found of con siderable magnitude. A mass weighing 1,088 grains was brought by Humboldt from South Amer ica, and deposited in the Berlin museum ; specific gravity 18*94. in 1822, a mass from Coudoto was deposited in the Madrid museum, measuring two inches and four lines in diameter, and weighing 11,641 grains. A specimen was found in the year 1827, in the Ural, not far from the Demidoff mines, which weighed 10-,*^ Russian pounds, or 11*57 pounds troy, and similar masses are not uncommon; the largest yet seen weighed 21 pounds troy, and is in the Demidoff cabinet. The metal platinum was brought from Choco, S. A., by Ulloa, a Spanish traveller in America, in the year 1735, and from Carthagena, by Charles Wood, who procured it in Jamaica. Ulloa speaks of specula made by the people of the country, of a peculiar metal, which Brownrigg says was \" platina,\" and the latter .mentions a \" pummel of a sword,\" and other articles of platinum, received by him from Carthagena. 4.

Obs. \u2014 Mercury in the metallic state is a rare mineral ; the quicksilver of commerce is obtained mostly from cinnabar, one of its ores. The rocks affording the metal and its ores are mostly clay shales or schists of different geological ages. At Cividale, in Venetian Lombardy, it is found in a marl regarded as a part of the Eocen? nummulitic beds. Mercury has been observed occasionally in drift; and near Eszbetek, in Tran sylvania, and also Newmarkt, in Galicia, springs, issuing from the Carpathian sandstone, some times bear along globules of mercury. Its most important mines are those of Idria, in Carniola, and Almaden in Spain. At Idria it occurs interspersed through a clay slate, from which it is obtained by washing. It is found in small quantities at Wolfstein and Morsfeld, in the Palatinate, in Carinthia, Hungary, Peru, and other countries ; also at Peyrat le Chateau, in the department of the Haute Vienne, in a disintegrated granite, unaccompanied by cinnabar; iu California, especially at the Pioneer mine, in the Napa Valley, where some of the quartz geodes contain several pounds of mercury. 9.

Obs. \u2014 Copper occurs in beds and veins accompanying its various ores, and is most abundant in the vicinity of dikes of igneous rocks. It is sometimes found in loose masses imbedded in the soil. In Siberia, and the island of Nalsoe, in Faroe, it is associated with mesotype, in amygdaloid, and though mostly disseminated in minute particles, sometimes branches through the rock with extreme beauty. At Turinsk, in the Urals, in fine crystals. Common in Cornwall, at many ofthe mines near Repdruth; and also in considerable quantities at the Consolidated mines, Wheal Buller, and others. Brazil, Chili, Bolivia, and Peru afford native copper; a mass now in the museum at Lisbon, supposed to be from a valley near Bahia, weighs 2,616 pounds; north of Tres Puntos, desert of Atacama, a large vein was discovered in 1S59. Iu Bolivia, at Coroeoro, in sandstone, and called in commerce \"Barilla de Cobre\" (copper barilla). Also found at some localities in China and Japan. This metal has been found native throughout the red sandstone (Triassico-Jurassic) region of the eastern United States, in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and more abundantly in New Jersey. where it has been met with sometimes in fine crystalline masses, especially at New Brunswick, Somerville, Schuyler's mines, and Flemington. One mass from near Somerville, ou the premises of J. C. Van Dyke, Esq., of N. Brunswick, weighed 78 pounds, and is said originally to have weighed 128. Near N. Brunswick a vein or sheet of copper, a line or so thick, has been traced for several rods. Near New Haven, Conn., a mass was formerly found weighing 90 pounds. No known locality exceeds in the abundance of native copper the Lake Superior copper region, near Kewenaw Point, where it exists in veins that intersect the trap and sandstone. The annual yield of native copper at the present time is about 8,000 tons. Masses of great size were observed in this district near the Ontanagon river, by Mr. Schoolcraft, in 1821. The largest single mass yet found was discovered in February, 1857, in the Minnesota mine, in the belt of conglomerate, which forms the foot- wall of the vein. It was 45 feet in length, 22 feet at the greatest width, and the thickest part was more than 8 feet. It contained over 90 p. c. copper, and weighed about 420 tons. This copper contains silver, sometimes in visible grains, lumps, or strings, and occasionally a mass of copper, when polished, appears sprinkled with large silver spots, resembling, as Dr. Jackson observes, a porphyry with its feldspar crystals. The copper occurs in trap or sandstone, near the junction of these two rocks, and has probably been produced through the reduction of copper ores. It is associated with prehnite, datolite, analcite, laumon tite, pectolite, epidote, chlorite, wollastonite, and sometimes coats amygdules of calcite, etc., in amygdaloid. Strings of copper often reticulate through crystals of analcite and prehnite. Pseudomorphs after scalenohedrons of calcite are sometimes met with. Besides this occurrence in the vicinity of trap, it is also in some parts ofthe Kewenaw region distributed widely in grains through the sandstone. Native copper occurs sparingly in California ; at the Union and Keystone, Napoleon and Laneha Plana mines iu Calaveras Co. ; in the Cosumnes mine, Amador Co. ; in serpentine, in Sta. Barbara Co. Also on the Gila river iu Arizona ; in large drift masses in Russian America. 13. IRON. Mars Alchem. Gediegen Eisen Germ. Fer natif Fr. Isometric. Cleavage octahedral. H.=4-5.

An iron so regarded, with some reason, occurs in the hill country above Bexley in Bassa Co., Liberia, Africa. An analysis afforded A. A. Hayes (Am. J. Sci., 11. xxi. ioi) iron 98-40 quartz grains, magnetite and a zeolite 1*60= 1 00. The mass of iron, from Canaan, Ot., pub lished as native, was artificial. A fragment of iron found near KnoxviUe, Tenn., but of uncertain exact locality and possibly meteoric, afforded Genth (ib., xxviii. 246) Iron 99-79, nickel 0-14, mag nesium 0022, calcium 0-121, silicium 0*075. cobalt irace=100-148. Cramer describes a mass weigh ing four pounds, obtained in the mine of Hackenburg. It is said to have been observed in thin lamin\u00e6 in an ironstone conglomerate in Brazil, and in lava in Auvergne ; also in the keuper m Thuringia, in an argillaceous sandstone, containing fossils ; it afforded but a trace of nickel : G = 5*24 (Fogg., lxxxviii. 1853, 145, where other localities are mentioned) ; also at Chotzen in Bohe mia,' in a limestone (the Planerkalk), affording on analysis Fe 98-83, graphite 0-74, As 0-32, Ni 0-61, and thought to be possibly an ancient meteorite (Jahrb. G. Reichs., viii. 354). The presence of metallic iron in grains in basaltic rocks (from Giant's Causeway, etc.) has been announced by Dr. Andrews. After pulverizing the rock aud separating by means of a magnet the grains that were attracted by it, he subjected the grains to the action of an acid solution of sul phate of copper in the field of a microscope, which salt, when there is a trace ot pure iron present, gives a deposit of copper ; and in his trials there were occasional deposits of copper in crystalline bunches. It has been noticed in other related rocks. Meteoric iron usually contains 1 to 20 per cent, of nickel, besides a small percentage of other metals, as cobalt, manganese, tin, copper, chromium ; also phosphorus common as a phosphuret, sulphur in sulphurets, carbon in some inst\u00a3u*ices, chlorine. For a review of papers on meteoric iron, see Rammelsberg's Handbuch der Mineralchemio (Liepzig, 1860). The following are a few analyses: 1, Berzelius (Ac. H.

The phosphorus in the analyses is combined with iron as Schreibersite ; the sulphur as Troilite; the magnesia, in anal. 5, with the silica prob ably as Enstatite. Among large iron meteorites, the Gibbs meteorite, in the Vale College cabinet, weighs 1,635 lbs.; length three feet four inches ; breadth two feet four inches ; height one foot four inches. It was brought from Red River. The Tucson meteorite, now iu the Smithsonian Institution, weighs 1 ,400 lbs. ; it was originally from Sonora. It is ring-shaped, and is 49 inches in its greatest diam eter. Still more remarkable masses exist in South America ; one was discovered by Don Rubin do Celis in the district of Chaco-Gualamba, whose weight was estimated at 32,000 lbs.; End another was found at Bahia in Brazil, whose solid contents are at least twenty-eight cubic feet, and weight 14,000 lbs. The Siberian meteorito, discovered by Pallas, weighed originally 1,600 lbs. aud contained imbedded crystals of chrysolite. Smaller masses are quite common. Meteoriciron is perfectly malleable, and may be readily worked iu a forge, and put to the same uses as manu factured iron. Bahr has observed grains of native iron iu a fragment of petrified wood. The iron was mixed with limonite and organic matter, aud is supposed to have been produced by the deoxydation of a salt of iron by the organic matter of the wood. He calls the iron Sideroferrite. Von Dechen reports that an artificial iron has been observed by him, which has cubic cleavage (Verh. uat. Ver. Bonn, 1861.)"], [73, "17 ZINC, 14. ZINC. Hexagonal, Hose. Cleavage : basal perfect.

It should bo stated that the zinc said to come from the Melbourne basalt was found by a quarryman and not by a scientific observer, and that therefore there may be an error with regard to its actually having been taken from the basalt. The existence of native zinc seems still to need confirmation. Stolba has recently obtained artificially hexagonal crystals of zinc, six-sided prisms with low pyramidal terminations (J. pr.

The crystals often contain numerous microscopic cavities, as detected by Brewster, and some are rendered nearly black by their number; and around these cavities the diamond shows evidence, by polarized light, of compression, as if from pressure in the included gas when the diamond was crystallized. Sometimes crystals bear impressions of other crystals. The back planes of diamonds reflect all the light that strikes them at an angle exceeding 24\u00b0 13', and hence comes the peculiar brilliancy of the gem. The refraction of light by the diamond is often irregular, probably arising from the cause which has produced the convex forms. In some plates from crystals, Descloizeaux has observed a fixed star of six symmetrical rays, and in others, allied in character, the rays were replaced by three large elliptical areas. Descloizeaux shows that the rays are symmetrical with reference to the faces of the octahedron. 2. Massive. In black pebbles or masses, called carbonado, occasionally 1,000 carats in weight.

Obs. \u2014 Thc diamond appears generally to occur in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock, called itacolumite, which pertains to the talcose series, and which in thin slabs is more or less flexible. This rock is found at the mines of Brazil and the Urals ; and also in Georgia and North Carolina, where a few diamonds have been found. It has also been detected in a species of conglomerate, composed of rounded siliceous pebbles, quartz, chalcedony, etc, cemented by a kind of ferruginous clay. Diamonds are usually, however, washed out from the soil According to M. Denis (Ann. des M., III. xix. 602) the diamond in Minas Geraes, Brazil, is found in two different deposits ; one called gvrgulho, consisting of broken quartz, and covered by a thin bed of sand or earth ; the other, cascalho, of rolled quartz pebbles, united by a ferruginous clay, resting usually on talcose clays, the whole the debris from talcose rocks. The first deposit affords the finest diamonds, and both contain also gold, platinum, magnetic iron, rutile, etc. The most celebrated mines are on tho rivers Jequitinhonha and Pardo, north of Bio Janeiro, where the sands (the waters being turned off) are washed by slaves. It has lately been sound in Bahia, on the river Cachoeira, at the mines of Surua and Sincora ; and Damour has recognized in the sand of the locality, quartz, feldspar, rutile, brookite, anatase, zircon, diaspore, magnetic iron, gold in grains, anhydrous phosphate of alumina and lime, a silicate of yttria, aud a hydro-phosphate of yttria. At Bogagem, Mina3 Geraes, an enormous diamond of 2541- carats has been found; it was a dodecahedron, with beveled edges, in which there were impressions of other diamond crystals, showing that it was originally one of a cluster ; it weighs, since cutting, 122 to 125 carats, and is called the \" Star of the South.\" The Brazilian mines were first opened in 1727, and it is estimated that since then they have yielded two tons of diamonds. The Ural diamonds occur in tho detritus along the Adolfskoi rivulet, where worked for t,old, and also at other places. In India the diamond is met with at Purteal, between Hyderabad and Masulipatam, where tho famous Kohinoor was found ; but there are now only two places of exploration, and these are let to some ofthe natives for less than 25 francs a year; and if the hands find a stone worth four or five rupees ($2 to $2*) a month, they consider themselves fortunate. To such a state are the famous mines of Golconda now reduced. They are obtained also near Parma in Bundelcund, where some of the most magnificent specimens have been found; also on the Mahanuddy near EUore. The locality on Borneo is at Pontiana, on the west side of tho Ratoos mountain. Tha river Gunil, in tho province of Constantine in Africa, is reported to have afforded some diamonds:. In the United States a few crystals have been met with in Rutherford Co., N. C, and Hall Co."], [79, "23 DIAMOND. Ga. (Am. J. Sci.

In California, at Cherokee ravine, in Butte Co. ; also in N. San Juan, Nevada Co. ; in French Corral, one of 1-Jj carats; at Forest Hill, El Dorado Co., of l\u00a3 carats; Fiddletown, Amador Co.; near Placerville. Reported from Idaho. In Australia, in the valley of the Turon ; in the bed of the Macquarie ; mouth of Pyramul Creek ; ou Calcula Creek ; and also in Victoria; also in West Australia, at Freemautle. In Brazil the diamond has been found massive, in small black pebbles, called carbonado, having tho specific gravity 3*012 \u2014 3*416. They proved ou trial to be puro carbon excepting 2'07 to 0-27 per cent. This compact diamoud is sold in the region at 75 cents the carat of three and one-sixth grains troy, and the masses are sometimes 1,000 carats in weight. Brewster finds that diamonds contain generally numerous microscopic cavities, and some are rendered nearly black by their number ; and around these cavities the diamond shows evidence of compression, as if from pressure in the included gas when the diamond was crystallizing. Diamonds have been observed having impressions of other crystals. The largest diamond of which we have any knowledge is mentioned by Tavernier as in posses sion of the Great Mogul. It weighed originally 900 carats, or 2769-3 grains, but was reduced by cutting to 861 grains. It has the form and size of half a hen's egg. It was found in 1550 in the mine of Colone. The Pitt or Regent diamoud weighs but 136-25 carats, or 419J- grains ; but is of unblemished transparency and color. It is cut in the form of a brilliant, and is estimated at \u00a3125,000. Tho Kohinoor measured, on its arrival in England, about If inches in its greatest diameter, over \u00a3 of an inch in thickness, and weighed 1 86^-,- carats, and was cut with many facets. It has since been recut, and reduced to a diameter of l-,2^ by If nearly, and thus diminished over one-third in weight. It is supposed by Mr. Tennant to have been originally a dodocahedron, and he suggests that the great Russian diamond and another large slab weighing 130 carats were actually cut from the original dodecahedron. Tavernier gives the original weight at 7S7-*j carats. The Rajah of Mattan has in his possession a diamond from Borneo, weighing* 367 carats. The mines of Brazil were not known to afford diamonds till the commencement of the 18th century. Colorless diamonds are in general most highly esteemed. When cut and polished, a diamoud of the purest water in England, weighing one carat, is valued at \u00a312 ; and the value of others is calculated by multiplying the square of the weight in carats by 1 2, except for those exceeding 20 carats, the value of which increases at a much more rapid rate. This rulo is scarely regarded in market, as the standard of purity and taste for different countries differs, and the slightest tinge of color affects greatly the commercial value. Blue is an exceedingly rare color ; and one of this shade, the Hope diamond, weighing only 4^ carats, but of peculiar beauty and brilliancy, is valued at \u00a325,000. A yellowish diamoud of large size (value \u00a312,000) has been found by Fremy to take a rose-red color when heated, which color it retains for two or three days, and then resumes the original yellow. An emerald-green diamond in the Dresden Treasury weighs 31 J carats. The ancient Romans had rings set with the diamond, and used the clippings for arming gravers' tools. Pliny speaks of the six-angled form of the crystals of the adamas, and their resemblance to two pyramids or tops placed base to base, a description that would apply, perhaps, as well to a double hexagonal pyramid as to an octahedron ; yet it is probable, from the other characters men tioned, the hardness, rarity, small size, use, and occurrence in gold regions, that the octahedral diamond was referred to. The adamas of the ancients included some corundum and other hard stones, and even hard metal. Theophrastus makes no mention of the true diamond. (See, on the adainas ofthe ancients, King on Precious Stones and Gems, p. 19.) The method of polishing diamonds was discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen ot Bruges, previous to which time the diamond was known in Europe ouly in its uncut state. It appears to have been practised long before iu India, the faceting of the Kohinoor dating far back into uncertain time. (See King, pp 30, 31.) The diamond has probably proceeded, like mineral coal and oil, from the slow decomposition of vegetable material, or even from animal matters, either source affording the requisite carbon ; but it has been formed under those conditions as to heat that has produced the metamorphism of argillaceous and arenaceous schists and their auriferous quartz veins; since it is sound exclusively in gold regions, or in the sands derived from gold-bearing rocks. The schists that were altered at the time may have previously been shales impregnated with petroleum, or other carbonaceous Bubstances (hydrocarburets) of organic origin. Chancourtois observes that the formation from a bydrocarburetted vapor or gas is analogous to that of sulphur from hydrosulphuretted emana tions. In the oxydation of the latter by the humid process, the hydrogen becomes oxydized, and only a part of the sulphur changes to sulphurous acid, the rest remainiug as sulphur. So in tho humid oxydation of a carburetted hydrogen, the hydrogen is oxydized, part of the carbon becomes carbonic acid, and tho rest remains as carbon and may form crystallized diamond."], [80, "24 NATIVE ELEMENTS. 25.

It is usually in foliated and fibrous masses, and in this form is found at Kapnik in Tran sylvania, at Moldawa in the Bannat, and at Felsobanya in Upper Hungary, where it exists in metalliferous veins, associated with realgar and native arsenic; at Hall in the Tyrol it is found iu gypsum ; at St. Gothard in dolomite ; at the Solfatara near Naples, it is the result of volcanic sublimation ; in Folmsdorf, Styria, found in brown coal. Near Julamerk in Koordistan, there is a large Turkish miue. Occurs also at Acobambillo, Peru. Small traces are met with in Edenville. Orange Co., N. Y., on arsenical iron. The name orpiment is a corruption of its Latin name auripigmentum, \" golden paint,\" which was given iu allusion to the color, and also because the substance was supposed to contain gold. The crystalline form is made monoclinic by Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 194). He makes i-i the clinodiagonal plane, and i-i the front or orthodiagonal, with the planes i-i, above and below i-i, hemidomes, inclined at unequal angles on i-i, that below at an angle 2C to 3\u00b0 the smaller.

Met with in veins at Wolfsbcrg, in the Harz : at Braunsdorf, near Freiberg ; at Przibram ; Felsobanya, Schemnitz, and Kremnitz, in Hungary, where it often occurs in diverging prisms, several inches long, accompanied by crystals of heavy spar and other mineral species ; at Pereta, in Tuscany, in crystals : in Katharinenberg, in the Urals ; in Dumfriesshire, fibrous and laminated ; in Cornwall, abundant near Padstow and Tintagel ; also crystallized at Wheal Boys ; at Hare Hill, in Scotland ; in Perthshire. Also found at different Mexican mines. Also abundant in Borneo. In the United States, it occurs sparingly at Carmel, Penobscot Co., Me. ; at Cornish and Lyme, N. H.; at \"Soldier'sUelight,\" Md. ; abundant in the granitic range, south side of Tulare valley, near pass of Sau Amedio ; in the Humboldt mining region in Nevada, and usually argentiferous ; also in the mines of Aurora, Esmeralda Co., Nevada. Also found in New Brunswick, 20 m. from Fredericton, S.W. side of St. John R. This ore affords nearly all the antimony of commerce. The crude antimony of the shops i! obtained by simple fusion, whieh separates the accompanying rock. From this product most of the pharmaceutical preparations of antimony are made, and the pure metal extracted. This ore was employed by the ancients for coloring the hair, eyebrows, etc., to increase the apparent size of the eye; whence they called the ore -rAarv,ty0_i.yox, from j.A*_v_s, broad, and 'otpOaXiids,"], [86, "30 SULPHIDS, ETC. eye. According to Dioscorides, it was prepared for this purpose by enclosing it in a lump of dough, and then burning it in the coals till reduced to a cinder. It was then extinguished with milk and wine, and again placed upon coals and blown till ignition : after which the heat waa discontinued, lest, as Pliny says, \"plumbum fiat,\" it become lead. It hence appears that the meta. antimony was occasionally seen by the ancients, though not distinguished from lead. On cryst. see Krenner, Ber. Ak. Wien, li. 1864, 436. Alt. \u2014 Changes on exposure by partial oxydation to antimony blende (2 Sb2 S3 + Sb2 O3), aud by further oxydation to valentinite (S2 O3).

At Numedal in Sweden, Arendal, Selba, and Tellemarken in Norway, Ner-^ehinsk in Russia, and Auerbach in Saxony, it has been observed in hexagonal prisms. Found also at Altenberg and Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony ; Schlackenwald and Zinnwald in Bohemia; Rathausberg in Austria ; near Miask, Urals ; Bastnaos, etc., Sweden; in Finland; Laurvig in Norway; Chessy in France; Peru; Brazil; Calbeck Fell, Carrock Fells, and near the source of the Caldew in Cumberland, associated with tungstate of lime and apatite ; several of the Cornish mines ; iu Scotland at East Tulloch, south of Loch Tay ; at Mount Coryby on Loch Creran, etc. In Maine, at Blue Hill Bay and Camdage farm, in largo crystallizations ; also at Brunswick, Bowdoinham, and Sanford, but less interesting. In Conn., at Haddam, and the adjoining towns on the Connecticut river, in gneiss in crystals and large plates ; also at Saybrook. In Vermont, at Newport, with crystals of white apatite. In N. Hampshire, at Westmoreland, four miles south of the north village meeting-house, in a vein of mica slate, abundant ; at Llaudaff in regular tabu lar crystals ; at Franconia. Iu Mass., at Shutesbury, east of Locke's pond ; at Brimfield, with iolite. In N. York, two miles southeast of Warwick, in irregular plates associated with rutile, zircon, and pyrite. In Penn., in Chester, on Chester Creek, near Reading ; near Coucord, Cabarrus Co., N. ft, with pyrite in quarts. In California, at Excelsior gold mine, in Excelsior district. In Canada, at Balsam Lake, Terrace Cove, Lake Superior ; north of Balsam Lake, on a small island in Big Turtle Lake, with scapolite, pyroxene, etc., in a vein of quartz intersecting crystalline limestoue; at St. Jerome, C.

SIMPLE SULPHIDS, TELLTJKIDS, SELENIDS, AKSENIDS, ANTIMONIDS, BISMUTHIDS, PHOSPHIDS, OF METALS OF THE GOLD, IEON, AND TIN GEOITPS Three divisions of these Sulphids, Arsenids, etc, are here recognized : (1) a basic division, in which the atomic ratio between the sulphur or arsenic metal and the others is 1 to more than one ; (2) a proto division, with the ratio 1:1; (3) a deulo division, with the ratio 1 : 2. In these ratios, and in stating the formulas beyond, the halved atomic weights of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are in view, as stated on p. 26. In the third division, some species are included which appear to be combinations of deuto and proto compounds. The mineral chalcopyrite is sometimes referred to the double-binary sulphids, on the ground of its containing, along with a protosulphid, the sulphid Fe2 S3 ; but as the existence of a sesqui sulphid Fe2 S3 is not established, while Fe S2 is the one of common occurrence, the more probable view of the sulphid is that it consists of two sulphids Fe S and Fe S2 in combination. This view is sustained by the near isomorphism of pyrite and chalcopyrite. The above remark applies also to bornite and pyrrhotite, in which Fe2 S3 has been supposed to be present. Fe2 S3, it should be noted, equals Fe S + Fe S2. Linn\u00e6ite and carrolite come into the same category. In an article in the American Journal of Science, vol. xliv. 1867, the author gives reasons foi believing that the compounds crystallizing in hexagonal forms have the number of atoms of the negative element 3, or a multiple of 3, and in tetragonal forms, a multiple of 4 ; whence it follows, that while ordinary isometric blende, or sulphid of zinc, for example, may be Zn S, the hexagonal, 3"], [90, "34 SULPHIDS, ETC. or wurtzite, is probably Zn3 S3. The principle, if real, has a very wide application among chemical and mineral species. I. BASIC OR DYSCRASITE DIVISION. 35. DYSCRASITE Ag2Sb 37. DOMETKITE Gil3 As' (B) \" Ag3 Sb 38.

Domeyko found a mass of ore from Chanarcillo, Chili, which was mainly impure chloro bromid of silver externally, to contain within (Tr. de Ensayes, 238, 1858) 55-9 p. c. of chlorid of silver, 15*1 of an antimonid of silver, with 14-5 of carbonates and 14-2 ochreous clay; and this antimouid, he says, consists of Sb 36, Ag 64, and \"appears to constitute a distinct species.\" Tlie formula would be Ag Sb. This species is not mentioned in his Mineralogy of 1860. Domeyko states (Min. 190, 1860) that at Chanarcillo a finely granular grayish-white silver ore, disseminated iu grains, taking the lustre of silver when rubbed, afforded him 4 to 6 p. c. of anti mony; that ofthe Descubridora mine 4-1 Ag; that ofthe Rosario mine 5-8 p. c. He also states that \"the filamentous silver of Bolivia contains Sb 3-7, As 2-3 p. c. 35D.

It appears, sometimes, at least, to be a mixture of arsenite of copper with domeykite. and some sulphid of copper. Rammelsberg treated one specimen with muriatic acid, and analyzed the soluble and insoluble portions separately, obtaining 1. Insoluble As 13*89 Cu 12-81 S 2-20 gangue 0'70=29-60 2. Soluble Xs 3-70 Cu 62-29 fl 5-83=71*82. The insoluble portion contains, therefore, As 4*16, Cu 13*89, with 10*85 of sulphid of copper; corresponding, the last excluded, to arsenic 23-04, copper 76-96=100. Ton Kobell (J. pr.

Blythe concludes, as a mean of many analyses, that the arsenid of copper contained in condur rite consists of arsenic 28*85, copper 71*15, which corresponds with the domeykite ; and Faraday's analysis (Phil. Mag, 1827, 286) leads to the same result, or arsenic 29*88, copper 70-11 ; but Rammelsberg's analysis gives a larger proportion of copper.

The supersulphuretted lead gave Johnston, Pb S 90-38, S 8-71. R. Hofmann found 8-7 p. c. of sulphur in a galenite from New-Sinka, Transylvania, along with 51'30 of sulphate of lead. Pyr. \u2014 In the open tube gives sulphurous fumes. B.B. on charcoal fuses, emits sulphurous fumes, coats the coal yellow, and yields a globule of metallic lead. Soluble in nitric acid. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in beds and veins, both in crystalline and uncrystalline rocks. It is often asso ciated with pyrite, marcasite, blende, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, etc., in a gangue of quartz, calcite, barite or fluor, etc. ; also with cerussite, anglesite, and other salts of lead, which are frequent results of its alteration. It is also common with gold, and in veins of silver ores. E. J. Chapman remarks that galenite is seldom much argentiferous except when it is associated with mispickel or some other arseuical ore. At Freiberg in Saxony it occupies veins in gueiss ; in Spain, in granite at Linares, and also in Catalonia, Grenada, and elsewhere : at Clausthal and Neudorf in the Harz, and at Przibram in Bohemia, it forms veins in clay slate ; in Styria it occurs iu the same kind of rock iu beds ; at Sala in Sweden it forms veins in granular limestone ; through the graywacke of Leadhills and the killas of Cornwall, in veins; i:i mountain limestone in Derbyshire, Cumberland, and the northern districts of Eugland, and also in Bleiberg, and the neighboring localities of Carinthia. In the English mines it is associated with calcite, pearl spar, fluor, barite, witherite, calamine, and blende. Other localities are Joachimsthal, where it is worked principally for the silver ; Przibram in Bohemia ; in Nertschinsk, East Siberia ; in Algeria ; near Cape of Good Hope ; in Australia ; Chili; Boh via, etc. Extensive deposits of this ore in the United States exist in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, and Wis consiu. The ore occurs iu stratified limestone, of different periods of the Lower Silurian era, especially the Trenton, associated with blende, smithsonite (\"dry-bone\" of the miners), calcite, pyrite, and often an ore of copper and cobalt. The mines of Missouri were discovered in 1720, by Francis Renault and Mr. la Motte ; they are situated iu the counties of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. Of the Upper Mississippi lead region, five-sixths, says Whitney (Rep. Up. Miss. region, 1S62), belong to Wisconsin, and the richest portion is in that part of the State adjoining Illinois and Iowa. The productive lead district is bounded on the west, north, and east by the Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Rock rivers. The occurrence of calc spar in the soil, or sink hole3 in lines, are considered indications of lead. From a single spot, not exceeding fifty yards square, 1,500 tons of ore have been raised. Occurs also in Illinois, at Cave-in-Rock, associated with fluorite. In New York, at Rossie, St"], [98, "42 SULPHIDS, ETC. Lawrence Co., in veins from one to three or four feet in width, the crystals often very large (like f. 70, without i), with calcite, iron and copper pyrites, and some blende and celestine; near Wurtzboro, Sullivan Co., in a large vein in millstone grit, with blende, iron and copper pyrites, at Ancram, Columbia Co. ; in Ulster Co., where often in crystals with the planes 0, 1, 3-3, i-3, or like 70, except that the edges are bevelled. Iu Maine, veins of considerable extent exist at Lubee, where the ore is associated with chalcopyrite and blende ; also less extensively at Blue Hill Bay, Bingham, and Parsonsville. In New Hampshire, at Eaton, with blende and chalcopyrite; and also at Haverhill, Bath, and Tamworth. In Vermont, at Thetford. In Connecticut, at Middle town, in a vein in argillite, massive and crystalline. In Massachusetts, at Southampton, Levereti, and Sterling. In Pennsylvania, at Phenixville and elsewhere. In Virginia, at Austin's mines in Wythe Co., Walton's gold mine in Louisa Co., and other places. In Tennessee, at Brown's Creek, and at Haysboro, near Nashville, with blende and heavy spar. In Michigan, in the region of Chocolate river and elsewhere, and Lake Superior copper districts; on tho N. shore of L, Superior, in Neebing on Thunder Bay, and around Black Bay. In California, at many of the gold mines. In Nevada, abundant on Walker's river, and at Steamboat Springs, Galena district. In Arizona, in the Castle Dome, Eureka, and other districts. In Colorado, at Pike's Peak, etc. Alt. \u2014 Minium, auglesite, cerussite, pyromorphite, wulfenite, tetrahedrite, chalcocite, diallogite, quartz, limonite, pyrite, pistomesite (pistopyrite Breith.), calamine, occur as pseudomorphs after galenite, partly from alteration, and partly through removal and substitution. A change to the carbonate (cerussite), with the setting free of sulphur, is the most common. The specimens regarded as pseudomorphs after pyromorphite, from Bernkastel on the Mosel, Breithaupt makes into a new species (B. H. Ztg., xxi. 99, 1862, xxii. 36, 1863), which he calls plumbeine, or one species of his Sexangulites, regarding this sulphid of lead as crystallized in hexagonal prisms, aud not a pseudomorph. It has G.=6-729 \u2014 6*87, and hexagonal cleavage. He places with it the stalactitic galena of Cornwall, Freiberg, aud Przibram. A galenite occurs in Lebauon Co., Pa., which has au easy octahedral cleavage, as first observed by Dr. John Torrey. It is regarded by some as proof of dimorphism ofthe sulphid of lead, and by others a3 a result of pseudomorphism after a mineral with octahedral cleavage. See Am. J. Sci., II. xxxv. 126. Dr. Torrey observes that on moderate heating the cleavage becomes cubic. In specific gravity it does not differ from ordinary galenite. Fournetile of Ch. Mtae (C. R., H. 463), supposed to be near tetrahedrite, is pronounced by Fournet (C. R., liv. 1096) a mixture of galenite with copper ore. Artif. \u2014 Galenite is sometimes a furnace product. It has been made in crystals by heating oxyd or silicate of lead with vapor of sulphur (Wurtz) ; also by suspending sulphate of lead in a bag in water saturated with carbonic acid, and in which putrid fermentation is kept up (as by an oyster in the water), there resulting an incrustation of galenite upon the shells (Gages, Brit Assoc, 206. 1863). 44A. Huascolite Dana. (Galena blendosa Domeyko, Min., 168, 1860. Sulphid of lead and zinc D. Forbes, Phil. Mag., IT. xxv. 110.) The characters are mostly those of galenite. It has a grauular or saccharoidal texture, a lead-gray color rather paler than ordinary galenite, but little lustre, and is apparently homogeneous and without any mixture of blende. Domeyko obtained (1. c) 8 19*2, Pb 48-ii, Zn 25*6, gangue 3-1 ; which corresponds nearly to Pb S + lJ Zn S. It \u2022somes from Ingahuas, in the province of Huasco, where it forms large aggregated masses or nodules in the lower part of the veiu. 44B. Cuproplumbite Breith. (Kupferbleispath of the Germans, Galena cdbriza Domeyko), from Chili, where it is not rare, appears to be, as Domeyko's name for it and his description implies (Min., 1S60, 168), a mere mixture of galenite and chalcocite. The structure, color, and lustro vary from those of galenite to those nearly of chalcocite and covellite : the color a little darker, md passing to iron-gray and indigo-blue ; the lustre generally feeble and sometimes almost want ing, and looking, says Domeyko, \" as if sulphuret of copper were distributed through it.\" The \u25a0specimens contain disseminated ores of copper, and come from a mine in Catemo (Aconcagua).

On charcoal in R.F. color*** the flame bluish, fuses to a globule, coats the coal near the assay with a lustrous metallic ring of tellurid of lead, outside of which it is brownish-yellow, and in O.F. still moro yellow. Entirely volatile, except a trace of silver. Obs.\u2014 From Savodinski near Siranovski, in the Altai, with hessite. Huot says that Beudant in his lectures changed his first use of the name Elasmose; and the later use Huot adopts in his Mineralogy, and Omalius d'Halloy in his Introduction to Geology. The confusion thus occasioued, and the unallowable form of the name, are reasons enough for set ting it aside altogether, and adopting Altaite. 49. BORNITE.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 In the open tube sulphurous fumes, and generally changes color. B.B. on char coal, in R.F., some varieties give at first a reddish-brown coating of oxyd of cadmium, and later a coating of oxyd of zinc, which is yellow while hot and white after cooling. With cobalt solution the zinc coating gives a green color when heated in O.F. Most varieties, after roasting, give with borax a reaction for iron. With soda on charcoal in R.F. a strong green zinc flame. Diffi cultly fusible. Dissolves iu muriatic acid, during which sulphuretted hydrogen is disengaged. Some specimens phosphoresce when struck with a steel or by friction. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in both crystalline and sedimentary rocks, and is usually associated with galena ; also with barite, chalcopyrite, fluorite, siderite, and frequently in silver mines. Derbyshire, Cumberland, aud Cornwall, afford different varieties ; also Transylvania ; Hungary ; the Harz; Sahla in Sweden ; Ratieborzitz iu Bohemia ; many Saxon localities. Splendid crystals are found in Binnenthal. A variety having a divergent fibrous structure and presenting botry oidal forms is met with in Cornwall ; at Raibel ; and at Geroldseck iu Baden. Abounds with the lead ore of Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. In N. York, Sullivan Co., near Wurtzboro', it constitutes a large part of a lead vein in millstone grit, and is occasionally. in octahedrons ; in St. Lawrence Co., brown blende occurs at Cooper's falls, in a vein of carbonate of lime; at Mineral Point with galena, and in Fowler, on the farm of Mr. Belmont, in a vein with iron and copper pyrites traversing serpentine ; at the Ancram lead mine in Columbia Co., . of yellow and brown colors ; in limestone at Lockport and other places, in houey aud wax-yellow crystals often transparent; with galena on Flat Creek, two miles south-west of Spraker's Basin.'

In Wisconsin, at Mineral Point, in fiue crystals, and many of large size (3 in. through, or so), altered to smith 3onite. In Tennessee, at Haysboro', near Nashville. Named blende because, while often resembling galena, it yielded no lead, the word in German meaning blind or deceiving. Sphalerite is from uipa^iph, treacherous. Alt.\u2014 Blende by oxydation changes to zinc vitriol. Calamine (2n3 Si + 1| H), smithsonite (Zn 0), aud limonite occur as pseudomorphs. The sulphate is decomposed by bi-carbonate of lime, producing smitlisonite ; and the alkaline silicates in solution, acting on the sulphate or carbonate, afford silicate of zinc. Artif.\u2014 Blende may be made in crystals from a solution of sulphate containing some putrifying animal matter ; in an experiment by Gages, using oysters for the animal matter, the shells were turned partly into carbonate of zinc and selenite, and some blende incrusted them. Also may be made by subjecting heated oxyd or silicate of zinc to vapors of sulphur. Rahtite of Shepard (1. c) is a wholly uncrystalline blende, with G.=4'128, containing iron and copper, and probably a mere mixture of blende and other minerals. Shepard says that it occurs \" in the upper decomposed portion of the Ducktown copper lode, associated with melaconite and various mixtures of chalcopyrite, redruthite,\" etc. The specimen analyzed by Mr. Tyler for Prof. Shepard was iron-black, while Shepard says that the mineral i3 \"dark lead-gray, with a tinge of blue, not unlike some ofthe ores of antimony.\" Tyler obtained (1. c.) for the composition of hia specimen, S 33-36, Zu 47-86, Fo 6-18, Cu 14-00, giving approximately 10 S, 7 Zn, 1 Fe, 2 Cu, and equivalent to 7 Zo S + Fe S2 + Gu S, or 7 of blende, with 1 pyrite and 1 chalcocite (redruthite). Since Gu (not Cu) replaces Fe and the related metals in the sulphids, the formula cannot be (Zn, Fe, Cu) S, or that of a cupreous blende. 67. VOLTZITE.

Tho Argent en epis or Cuivre spiciforme of Haiiy, which is merely vegetable matter impregnated with this ore, occurs at Frankenberg in Hessia, and also Mahoopeny, Penn. Under the name Cupreine, Breithaupt separates the larger part of the specimens, referred to chalcocite, on the ground alleged that they are hexagonal instead of orthorhombic, and have a lower specific gravity. He gives for the angle between the base and a pyramidal face 117\u00b0 53' approxi- mately, and G.=5*5\u2014 5-586 of the mineral from 12 different localities. He cites Scheerer's two analyses above of the Tellemark mineral. Other localities mentioned are Kongsberg in Norway ; near Freiberg, Sadisdorf, Deutsch-Neudorf, in Saxony ; Schmiedeberg in Silesia ; Hettstedt and Sangerhausen in Thuringia ; near Siegen ; Mt. Catini in Tuscany ; Bosgolovsk in Siberia ; Karga- linsk Steppes in Orenberg; Cornwall; Eleonora and Ulrique in Mexico; West Coast of Africa. Breithaupt is certainly iu error with regard to tho Cornwall mineral, as the measurements of Phillips and others, and recently of Maskelyne (in a letter to the author*), conclusively prove ; and probably in error throughout. Beudant's name, chalcosine, has priority. We change the termination ine, which ought to be out ofthe science, and substitute c for s. Chalcite (^oX\u00abtis in Greek), Aristotle's name for the common ore of Cyprus, cannot be employed in modern mineralogy, because it has the same pro- nunciation with calcite. But with the added syllable, used above, this objection does not hold. Moreover, the word thus altered does not imply an identity of the species with that of Cyprus about which there is yet much doubt. Alt Occurs altered to chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, melaconite. Specimens are often penetrated with the covellite, or indigo-copper, resulting from the altera- tion. (A) Digenite of Breithaupt (1. c.) is probably a mineral of this kind. Plattner obtained B.B., 70*2 of copper and 0-24 of silver, whence the formula Gu S + 2 Gu S2, making it a compound of 1 chalcocite + 2 covellite. Localities mentioned are Sangerhausen in Thuringia; Szaska in Tran- sylvania; in the Government of Orenburg; Platten in Bohemia; Angola, W. Coast of Africa; Chili, with cuproplumbite. (B) Carmenite of Hahn (L c.), from Carmen island, in the Gulf of California, approaches digenite. It is au impure chalcocite, containing visibly, as the author finds after personal examination, much covellite. Hahn analyzed the mass by first separating into two parts, oue soluble in muriatic acid, and the other not ; and the former was then analyzed, and the composition obtained given as that of carmenite; it was S 26-22, Sb 0-97, Cu 71-30, Fe 1-37, Ag 005, gangue 0-77 = 100*68, corresponding to 1 chalcocite + 1 covellite. (C) Haekisite of Shepard (Rep. on Canton Mine, cited in Am. J. Sci., II. xxii. 256 and Prat7 Am. J. Set II. xxiii. 409), from Canton mine, Georgia, and later found at the Polk Co. copper mines in East Tenuessee, is chalcocite with the cloavage of galeua, and, as Genth has proved, is pseudomorphous after galena. Genth's many analyses of the Tennessee mineral (Am. J. Sci. IL xxxiii. 1 94) show a variation in composition from that of chalcocite to that of a mixture with 2 1 p. c. of galena. Unaltered galena has been observed within crystals of harrisite both at the \u25a0Georgia and Tennessee localities. Its color is dark lead-gray and bluish-black. As Genth .'bserves, it is related to the so-called cuproplumbite (p. 42)."], [110, "54 SULPHIDS, ETC.

Obs. \u2014 Cinnabar occurs in beds in slate rocks and shales, and rarely in granite or porphyry. It"], [112, "56 SULPHIDS, ETC, has been observed in veins, with ores of iron. The Idria mines are in the Carboniferous forma tion ; those of New Almaden, California, in partially altered Cretaceous or Tertiary beds. Good crystals occur in the coal formations of Moschellandsberg and Wolfstein iu the Palatinate; also in Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The most important European beds of this ore are at Almaden in Spain, and at Idria in Carniola, where it is usually massive. It occurs at Reichenau in Upper Carinthia ; in beds traversing gneiss at Dunbrawa in Transylvania ; in graywaeke at Windisch Kappel in Carinthia ; at Neumarktel in Carniola ; at Ripa in Tuscany ; at Schemnitz in Hungary \u2022 in the Urals and Altai ; in China abundantly, and in Japan ; San Onofre and elsewhere in Mexico ; at Huanca Velica in Southern Peru, abundant ; iu the Provinces of Coquimbo ; Copiapo in Chili ; forming extensive mines in California, in the coast ranges at different points from Clear lake in the north (near which there is a vein in a bed of sulphur) to San Luis Obispo in the south, the prin cipal mines in which region are at New Almaden and the vicinity, in Santa Clara Co., about 60 m. S.S.E. of San Francisco. Also in Idaho, in limestone, abuudant. This ore is the source of the mercury of commerce, from which it is obtained by sublimation. When pure it is identical with the manufactured vermilion of commerce. The above figure is from an elaborate paper by Schabus, Ber. Ak. Wien, vi. 63. The name Cinnabar is supposed to come from India, where it is applied to the red resin, drag on's blood. The native cinnabar of Theophrastus is true cinnabar ; he speaks of its affording quicksilver. The Latin name of cinnabar, minium, is now given to red lead, a substance which was early used for adulterating cinnabar, and so got at last the name. It has been said (King on Precious Stones) that the word mine (miniera, Ital) and mineral come from the Latin for quicksilver mine, miniaria (Fodina miniaria). 65. TIEMANNITE.

Found at Chatham, Conn., in gneiss, associated with smaltite. This is an important oro of nickel. Named from the contained metal. The name of the species should be formed from the Latin word for nickel, niccolum, proposed by Cronstedt, and hence should be written niccoline, or bettei niccolite, in place of Beudant's nickeline.

Obs. \u2014 Pyrite occurs abundantly in rocks of all ages, from the oldest crystalline to the most recent alluvial deposits. It usually occurs in small cubes, but often modified as above described; also in irregular spheroidal nodules and in veins, in clay slate, argillaceous sandstones, the coal formation, etc. Cubes of gigantic dimensions have been found in some of the Cornish mines ; pentagonal dodecahedrons and other forms occur on the island of Elba, sometimes five to six inches in diameter. Largo octahedral crystals are found at Persberg in Sweden. Magnificent crystals come from Peru; also from Traversella in Piedmont, twins of which locality are figured oy Q. Sella, one of them a large pyritohedron (f. 47) with a small converse pyritohedron (f. 48) astride of each of the six cubic edges. Alston-Moor, Derbyshire, Fahlun in Sweden, Kongs berg in Norway, are well-known localities. The clay at Miinden in Hanover, and the chalk at Lewes in Surrey, have afforded some remarkable compound crystals. It has also been met with in the Vesuvian lavas in small irregular crystals. In Maine, at Corinna, Peru, Waterville, and Farmington, in crystals ; at Bingham (saw mills), Brooksville, and Jewell's Id., massive. In N. Hampshire, at Unity, massive.

In Wisconsin, near Mineral Point. In Illinois, near Galena, at Marsden's Diggings, in stalactites of great beauty with a surface of crystals. In N. Car., near Greensboro', Guilford Co., in crystals. Auriferous pyrite is common at the mines of Colorado, and many of those of California, as well as in Virginia and the States south. In Canada, 2 miles N. W. of Brookville, a cobaltiferous var., in the Laurentian ; on the river Assumption, seignory of Daillebout, and at Escott, a niccoliferous var., containing also some cobalt. This species affords the greater part of the sulphate of iron and sulphuric acid of commerce, and also a considerable portion of the sulphur and alum. The auriferous variety is worked for gold in many gold regions. The name pyrite is derived from -vp, fire, and alludes to the sparks from friction. Pliny men tions several things as included under the name (xxxvi. 30) : (1) a stone used for grindstones ; (2) a kind which so readily fires punk or sulphur that he distinguishes it as pyrites vivus, and which may have been flint or a related variety of quartz, as has been supposed, but more proba bly was emery, since he describes it as the heaviest of all; (3) a kind resembling brass or copper; (4) a porous stone, perhaps a sandstone or buhrstone. The brassy kind was in all probability our pyrite. But with it were confounded copper pyrites (chalcopyrite), besides marcasite and pyrrho tite, although these three kinds of pyrites fail of the scintillations. Iu fact, Dioscorides calls pyrite an ore of copper, yet in the next sentence admits that some kinds contain no copper ; and. moreover, he states that the mineral gives sparks. This confounding of iron and copper pyrites is apparent also in the descriptions of the vitriols (sulphates of iron and copper) by Pliny and other ancient writers, and equally so in the mineralogy of the world for more than fifteen cen turies after Pliny, as is even now apparent in the principal languages of Europe. Kupferwasser (copper-water) of the Germans being the copperas of the English and couperose of the French. It is quite probable that copperas and couperose are in fact corruptions ofthe German word, instead of derivatives from cuprosa or cuprirosa, as usually stated, for the Latin u would not have become ou iu French. Under the name marcasite or marchasite, of Spanish or Arabic origin, the older mineralogists, Henckel, Wallerius, Linn\u00e6us, etc., included distinctively crystallized pyrite, the cubic preemi nently ; the nodular and other varieties being called pyrites, and the less yellow or brownish aud softer kinds, wasserkies, this last including our marcasite and pyrrhotite, and some true pyrite. Werner first made pyrrhotite a distinct species. Alt. \u2014 Pyrite readily changes to a sulphate of iron by oxydation, some sulphur being set free. Also to limonite on its surface, and afterward throughout, by the action of a solution of bicar bonate of limo carrying off the sulphuric acid as change proceeds, and from limonite to red oxyd of iron. Green vitriol, limonite, gothite, hematite, quartz, graphite, ochreous clay, occur as pseu domorphs after pyrite. Artif. \u2014 May be made by the slow reduction of sulphate of sesquioxyd of iron in presence of some carbonate. 76. HAUERITE. Hauerit Haid., Nat. Abb.. Wien, i. 101, 107, 4to, 1847.

Traces of selenium have been noticed by Kersten in an ore from Reinsberg near Freiberg ; and that from Rammelsberg near Goslar must contain tho same, it being one of the furnace products (Rammelsberg, Min.

Pyr., etc.\u2014 In the closed tube decrepitates, and gives a sulphur sublimate ; in other reactions like cubanite. Dissolves in nitric acid, excepting the sulphur, and forms a green solution ; am monia in excess changes the green color to a deep blue. Obs.\u2014 Chalcopyrite is the principal ore of copper at the Cornwall mines, and 10,000 to 12,000 tons of pure copper are smelted annually from 150,000 to 160,000 tons of ore. It is there associated with tin ore, galenite, bornite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite, and blende. The copper beds of Fah lun m Sweden, are composed principally of this ore, which occurs in large masses, surrounded by a ooating of serpentine, and imbedded in gneiss. At Rammelsberg, near Goslar in the Harz, :t forms a bed in argillaceous schist, and is associated with pyrite, galenite, blende, and minute portions of silver and gold. The Kurprinz mine at Freiberg affords well-defined crystals. It occurs also iu the Bannat, Hungary, and Thuringia ; in Scotland in Kirkcudbrightshire, Perth shire and elsewhere ; in Tuscany (analyses 3, 4); in South Australia; in sine crystals at Cerro Blanco, near Copiapo, Chili. In Maine, at the Lubec lead mines; at Dexter. In N. Hamp., at Franconia, in gneiss; at Unity, on the estate of Jas. Neal; Warren, on Davis's farm; at Eaton, 2 m.

In Virginia, at the Phenix copper mines, Fauquier Co., and tho Walton gold mine, Louisa Co. In N. Carolina, near Greensboro', abundant massive (Fenress or North Carolina, and Macculloch mines), along with spathic iron in a quartz gangue. In Ten nessee, 30 miles from Cleveland, iu Polk Co. (Hiwassee mines), with black copper and pyrites. In Cal, in different mines along a belt between Mariposa Co. and Del Norte Co., on west side of, and paraUel to, the chief gold belt ; occurring massive in Calaveras Co., at Union, Keystone, Empire, Napoleon, Campo Seco, and Lancha Plana mines, and in crystals on Domingo Creek; in Mariposa Co., at the La Victoire and Haskell claims, and ou the Chowchillas river ; in Amadoi Co., at the Newton mine ; in El Dorado Co., at the Cosumnes, Hope VaUey, Bunker Hill, Ei Dorado, Excelsior mines ; in Plumas Co., at the Genesee and Cosmopolitan miues. In Canada, in Perth aud near Sherbrooke ; extensively mined at Bruce mines, on Lake Huron. The CornwaU chalcopyrite is not a rich ore ; what is picked for sale at Redruth rarely yielding 12, generaUy only 7 or 8, and occasionally but 3 or 4 per cent, of metal. Its richness may in general be judged of by the color ; if of a fine yellow hue, and readily yielding to the hammer, it may bo considered a good ore ; but if hard, and pale-yeUow, it is poor from admixture with pyrite. Readily distinguished from pyrite, which it somewhat resembles, by its inferior hardness ; it may be cut by the knife, while pyrite will strike fire with steel. The effects of nitric acid are also different. Differs from gold in being brittle, on which account it cannot be cut off in slices, like the latter metal ; and, moreover, gold is not attacked by nitric acid. Occurs as a furnace product near Goslar. Alt,\u2014 Changes on exposure with moisture, especially if heated, to a sulphate. Malachite, coveUite, chrysocoUa, black copper, chalcocite, and oxyd of iron, are other forms into which it is sometimes altered. Named from brass, and pyrites, by Henckel, who observes in his Pyritology (1725) that chalcopyrite is a good distinctive name for the ore. Aristotle caUs the copper ore of Cyprus cludcitis ; and Dioscorides uses the same word ; but what ore was intended is doubtful. There is no question that copper-pyrites was included by Greek and Latin authors under the name pyrites (q. v., p. 64). 79. BARNHARDTITE. Genth, Am. J. Sci., H. xix. 17, 1855, xxviii. 248.

(A) Homichlet Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xviL 385, 424, 1858, xviii. 65, 321) is closely related to the preceding, and may be chalcopyrite partly altered to bornite.

B.B. on charcoal gives an arsenical odor, and fuses to a globule, which, treated with successive portions of borax-glass, affords reactions for iron, cobalt, and nickel. Obs \u2014 Usually occurs in veins, accompanying ores of cobalt or nickel, and ores of sUver and copper; also, in some instances, with niccolite and arsenopyrite; often having a coating of annabergite. Occurs with silver and copper at Freiberg, Annaberg, and particularly Schneeberg in Saxony ; at Joachimsthal in Bohemia, the reticulated varieties are frequently found imbedded in calc spar, and also at Wheal Sparnon in Cornwall ; at Riechelsdorf in Hesse, in veins in the copper schist ; at Tuuaberg iu Sweden ; Allemont in Dauphins'*; at the silver mines of Tres Puntas and others in Chili, but ouly iu smaU quantities Also iu crystals at Mine La Motte, Missouri. See analyses above for the varieties at these localities. At Chatham, Conn., the chloanthite (chathamite) occurs in mica slate, associated generally with arsenopyrite and sometimes with niccolite. This species and the cobaltite were confounded by the mineralogists of last century; and although right chemical distinctions were early indicated by those of Sweden, doubts continued untd the analyses by John and Stromeyer in 1811 and 1817. Rome de Lisle brought out and figured correctly the crystallographic distinctions in 1772 and 1783; but the value of his deter minations were not generally appreciated. Alt. \u2014 Occurs altered to erythrite (arsenate of cobalt), a change due to the oxydation of the arsenic and cobalt on exposure to moisture. 84. SKUTTERUDITE.

Char., 1823, 111, 246, and arsenid of copper, it from the Mine Briccius, near Annaberg. A Chilian weisskupfererz contains, according to Plattne: (Breith., in Pogg, lviii. 281), 12-9 p. c. of copper, besides iron and sulphur, but no arsenic. Another so caUed, from Schneeberg, is, according to v. KobeU (J. pr. Ch., lxxi. 159), impure marcasite. Weisskupfererz (abo caUed weisskupfer and iveisserz) occurs as the name of a species in aU the mineralogical works of last century, from Henckel's Pyrotology, iu 1725, where it is called a whitish copper ore, and placed near tetrahedrite ; and the light color, from Henckel down, is attributed to the presence of arsenic. It has finally been run out as mostly impure marcasite; and the domeykite and related species (p. 36) are now the only true white copper. Obs. \u2014 The spear variety occurs abundantly in the plastic clay of the brown coal formation at Littwitz and AltsatteU, near Carlsbad in Bohemia, and is extensively mined for its sulphur and the manufacture of the sulphate of iron. The radiated variety occurs at the same place ; also at Joachimsthal, and in several parts of Saxony. The cockscomb variety occurs with galenite and fluor-spar iu Derbyshire ; crystals near Castleton in Derbyshire ; near Alston Moor in Cumber land ; near Tavistock iu Devonshire ; and radiated at East Wheal Rose and elsewhere in CornwalL At Warwick, N. Y., it occurs in simple aud compound crystals, in granite, with zircon. Hustis's farm, in PhiUipstown, N. Y., affords small crystals, referred by Beck to this species, occurring in magnesian Umestone. Massive fibrous varieties abound throughout the mica slate of New Eng land, particularly at Cummington, Mass., where it is associated with cummingtonite and garnet. Occurs at Lane's mine, in Monroe, Conn., and iu the topaz and fluor vein in TrumbuU ; also in gneiss at East Haddam ; at HaverhiH, N. H., with common pyrite. In Cauada in Neebing. a few mdes east of the Kamanistiquia R. Marcasite is employed in the manufacture of sulphur, sulphuric acid, and sulphate of iron, though less frequently than pyrite. Its color is considerably paler than that of ordinary pyrite. The word marcasite, of Arabic or Moorish origin (and variously used by old writers), was the name of common crystallized pyrite among miners and mineralogists in later centuries, untd near the close ofthe last. It was first given to this species by Haidinger in 1845. The species is probably recognized by Agricola under the name wasserkies and lebererz; anl also under the same by Cronstedt ; and it is Wasserkies of Hausmann in both editions of his great work. This name, wasserkies (pyrites aquosus, as Cronstedt translates it), is little applicable; yet may have arisen from the greater tendency of the mineral to become moist and alter to vitriol than pyrite\u2014 if it be not an early corruption, as Agricola seems to think (see above), of Weisserkies (white iron pyrites). It appears to have been used also for easdy decomposable pyrite; and pyrrhotite was also included under its other name, pyrites fuscus. The rhombic crystallization is mentioned by de Lisle ; but Hauy long afterward considered it only an irregularity of common iron pyrites. Marcasite is made by Breithaupt (J. pr. Ch., iv. 257, 1835) a generic name for the various species of pyrites. Lo-soHiniTE Breit. & Plattn., Pogg., lxxvu. 135 (Kausimkies, Br. Char., 254, 1832).

B.B. on charcoal forms two coatings : one white and volatile, consisting of a mixture of antimouite, teUurite, and sulphato of lead; aud the other yellow, less volatile, of oxyd of lead quite near the assay.

Named after CoveUi, the discoverer of the Vesuvian coveUite, by Beudant, and without refer ence to the ore as previously described. Covellite is a result of the alteration of other ores of copper, and is often mixed with chalcocite or copper-glance, from which it has been derived. (See Digenite and Carmenite, p. 53.) (A) Cantonite is covellite from the Canton mine, Georgia, occurring in cubes, with a cubical cleavage. It is associated with harrisite (pseudomorphs of chalcocite after galenite, see p. 53), and is regarded by Genth as a pseudomorph of coveUite after the harrisite. Genth obtained in his analysis (1. c, xxiii. 417), S 32*76, Se trace, Ag 0*36, Cu 65*60, Pb 0-11, Fe 0*25, insoluble 0*16 =99-24.

Obs. \u2014 From the vaUey of Binnen in the St. Gothard Alps, in crystaUine dolomite, along with sartorite, jordanite, binnite, realgar, orpiment, blende, pyrite. The crystals are sometimes an inch across. Damour, who first studied the arsenio-sulphids of Binnen, analyzed the massive ore and named it dufrenoysite. He inferred that the crystallization was mouometric from some associated crystals, and so published it. This led von Waltershausen and Heusser to cull the monometric mineral dufrenoysite. and the latter to name the trimetric binnite. Von Waltershausen, after studying the prismatic mineral, made out of the species arsenomelan and scleroclase, yet partly on hypothetical grounds. Recently it has been found that three orthorhombic minerals exist at the locality, as an nounced by vom Rath, who identifies one, by specific gravity and composition, with Damour's dufrenoysite; another he makes scleroclase of von Waltershausen (sartorite, p. 87) ; and the othe! he names jordanite (p. 88)."], [149, "8ULPHAKSEOTTES, ETC. 93 114.

Cobalt occurs in the ore of Sehwarzwald, Moschellandsberg, Schottenhofeu near Zell, Clara near Schapbach, and others. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Differ in the different varieties. In the closed tube all fuse and give a dark -red sublimate of sulpliid of antimony ; when containing mercury, a faint dark-gray sublimate appears at a low red heat ; and if much arsenic, a sublimate of sulphid of arsenic first forms. _ In tho open tube fuses, gives sulphurous fumes and a white sublimate of antimony ; if arsenic is present, a crystalline volatile sublimate condenses with the antimony ; if the ore contains mercury it con denses in the tube in minute metallic globules. B.B. on charcoal fuses, gives a coating of anti monous acid and sometimes arsenous acid, oxyd of zinc, and oxyd of lead ; the arsenic may be detected by the odor when the coating is treated in R.F. ; the oxyd of zinc assumes a greeu color when heated with cobalt solution. The roasted mineral gives with the fluxes reactions for iron and copper ; with soda yields a globule of metalhc copper. To determine the presence of a trace of arsenic by the odor, it is best to fuse the mineral on charcoal with soda. The presence of mer cury is best ascertained by fusing the pulverized ore iu a closed tube with about three times its weight of dry soda, tho metal subliming and condensing in minute globules. The silver is de termined by cupellation. Decomposed by nitric acid, with separation of sulphur and antimonous and arsenous acids. Obs.\u2014 The Cornish mines, near St. Aust., have afforded large tetrahedral crystals, with rough aud dull surfaces. Moro brilliant crystallizations occur at the Levant mine near St. Just, at Couduv row mine and other places in Cornwall ; at Andreasberg and Clausthal in the Harz ; Kremnitz in Hungary; Freiberg in Saxony \u2022 Przibram in Bohemia ; Kahl in Spessart; Kapnik in Transyl vania ; Dillenburg in Nassau ; and other localities mentioned above. The ore containing mercury occurs in Schmolnitz, Hungary ; at Poratsch, Zavatka, and Kotter bach near Iglo; at Sehwatz in the Tyrol; and in the valleys of Angina and Castello in Tuscany. Tetrahedrite is found in America ; in Mexico, at Durango, etc. ; at various mines in Chili ; in Bolivia; at the Kellogg mines, 10 m. N. of Little Rock, Arkansas, with galenite. In California in Mariposa Co., in the Pine Tree gold vein and others ; in Shasta Co., Chicago claim. In Nevada, abundant at the Sheba aud De Soto mines, Humboldt Co., massive and rich in silver (the De Soto containing 16-4 p. c. of silver, Allen); near Austin in Lander Co. ; in Arizona at the Heintzelmau mine, containing 1-J- p. c. of silver ; at the Santa Rita mine. Alt.\u2014 Chalcopyrite, malachite, azurite, amalgam, bournonite, erythrite, cinnabar, covelhte, occur as pseudomorphs after tetrahedrite. Also a red pulverulent mineral, consisting of an acid \u00bbf antimony, oxyd of copper or oxyd of mercury, etc. (See Ammiolite.) Annivite of Brauns (Mitth. nat. Ges.

It is soft, of greasy appearance, greenish-gray, slightly reddish, with powder bright-red. Domeyko considers it impure with blende, pyrite, and galenite. Ettliug observes (ib., vi. 140) that the con stitution is analogous rather to enargite than tetrahedrite, corresponding to the formula 4 (Gu, Zn, Fe, Ag) S + (Sb, As') S5.

Ch., xxxvi. 127) contains 9*02 per cent, of sulphate of magnesia, which is equivalent to 10 parts of common salt to 1 of sulphate of maguesia. It is from Stass furt. In Rammelsberg's analysis the water was hygroscopic, and the specimen contained 0*48 of mixed karstenito. In a dirty reddish salt from Abingdon, Washington Co., Va., E. Stieren found (Jahresb., 1862, 766) NaCl 90*55, gypsum 0*45, clay and carb. lime 9-00=100. The bluish and indigo-colored salt of Stassfurt, etc., possibly owes its color, according to Prof. S. W. Johnson, to the presence of subchlorid of sodium. Pyr., etc In the closed tube fuses, often with decrepitation ; when fused on the platinum loop colors the flame deep yellow. Other reactions like those given under sylvite. Obs. \u2014 Common salt occurs in extensive but irregular beds in rocks of various ages, associ ated with gypsum, polyhalite, clay, saudstone, aud calcite; also dissolved, and forming salt \u25a0springs. In Europe and England it occurs in the Triassic, associated with red marl or saudstone, but it is not confined to these rocks. At Durham, Northumberland, and Leicestershire, England, salt springs rise from the Carboniferous series; in the Alps, some salt works are suppUed from Oolitic rocks; .he famous mines of Cardona and Wieliczka are referred, the former to the Green Sand formation."], [169, "113 CHL0RIDS. and the latter to Tertiary rocks. Salt springs also occur in volcanic regions. In the United States the brines of New York come from Upper SUurian strata; those of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Vir ginia, mostly from Devonian and Subcarboniferous beds ; those of Michigan, mainly from tho Subcarboniferous and Carboniferous ; whUe in Louisiana, at Petit Anse, there is a thick bed of pure salt iu the Post-tertiary or more recent deposits of the coast ; recent explorations there have proved that it underlies 144 acres, and it has been penetrated to a depth of 38 feet without showing any change in its structure or purity. Salt also occurs as efflorescences over the dry prairies and shallow ponds or lakes of the Rocky Mountains, California, Atacama; aud in mos't desert or semi-desert regions there are numerous salt lakes. The principal mines of Europe are at Wieliczka, iu Poland ; at HaU, in the Tyrol ; Stassfurt, iu Prussian Saxony ; and along the range through Reichenthal in Bavaria, HaUein in Salzburg, HaUstadt, Ischl, and Ebensee, in Upper Austria, and Aussee in Styria; in Hungary, at Marmoros and elsewhere; iu Transylvania; WaUachia, GaUicia, aii'l Upper Silesia; Vie and Dieuze iu France ; VaUey of Cardona and elsevhere in Spain, forming hills 300 to 400 feet high ; Bex in Switzerland ; and Northwich in Cheshire, England. At Cheshire it occurs in a basin-shaped deposit, and is arranged in spheroidal masses, from 5 to 8 feet in diameter, which are composed of concentric coats, and present polygonal figures. It is but little contaminated with impurities, and is prepared for use by merely crushing it between iron rollers. At the Austrian mines, where it contains much clay, the salt is dissolved in large chambers, and the clay thus precipitated. After a time the water, fuUy saturated with the salt, is conveyed by aqueducts to evaporating houses, and the chambers, after being cleared out, are again fided ; at Berchtesgaden, the water is saturated iu a month, at HaU it takes nearly a year. It also occurs, forming hiUs and covering extended plains, near Lake Oroomiah, the Caspian Lake, etc. In Algeria; in Abyssinia; in India in the province of Lahore, and in the vaUey of Cashmere; in China aud Asiatic Russia; in South America, in Peru, aud at Zipaquera and Nemocon, the former a large mine long explored iu the CordiUeras of Granada. OccasionaUy formed at the eruptions of Vesuvius, as in 1855, when it was found iu cubes, incrustations, and stalactites. In the United States, salt has been found forming beds with gypsum, in Virginia, Washington Co., 18 m. from Abingdon ; in the Salmon River Mts. of Oregon; in Louisiana, as already men tioned. Brine springs are very numerous iu the Middle and Western States. These springs are worked at Salina and Syracuse, N. Y. ; in the Kanawha Valley, Va. ; Muskingum, Ohio ; Michi gan, at Sagiuaw and elsewhere ; and in Kentucky. The salt water is obtained by boring, and raised by means of machinery, and thence conveyed by troughs to the boilers, where it is evapo rated by artificial heat; or to basins for evaporation by exposure to the heat ofthe sun. The foUowing table by Prof. Beck (Mineralogy of New York, p. 112), gives the amount of brine required for a bushel of salt at the principal salt springs in the United States : GaUs. GaUs.

Vast lakes of salt water exist in many parts of the world. Lake Timpanogos in the Rocky mountains, 4,200 feet above the level ofthe sea, now caUed the Great Salt Lake, is 2,000 squara miles in area. L. Gale found in this water 20*196 per cent, of chlorid of sodium (Stansb. Exped. cited in Am. J. Sci., II. xvii. 129). The Dead and Caspian Seas are salt, and the waters ofthe former contain 20 to 26 parts of soUd matter in 100 parts. Prof. Gmelin, who analyzed a portion of these waters of specific gravity 1-212, fouud them to contain chlorid of calcium 3*336, chlorid of magnesium 12-167, chlorid of sodium 7*039, sulphate of lime 0052, bromid of magnesium 0*443, chlorid of potassium 1*0S6, chlorid of aluminum 0-144, chlorid of ammonium 0*007, chlorid of manganese 0-161=24-435, with 75-565 water= 100*000. This result is given as corrected by Marchand. Alt. \u2014 Anhydrite, gypsum, polyhalite, occur as pseudomorphs after this species ; also celestine, dolomite, quartz, hematite, pyrite ; the removal of the salt cubes by their solution, leaves a cavity which any mineral may then occupy.

Observed after the eruption of Vesuvius in 1S55, in rhombic dodecahedrons with cavernous faces ; and as usual it occurred where the lavas had spread over sod and vegetation. Also found in smaU quantities in the vicinity of ignited coal seams, as at St. Etieune in France, and also at Newcastle, and in Scotland ; crystallized near Duttweiler in Prussia, where a coal seam has beeu burning for more than a hundred years. It occurs also in Bucharia ; at KUauea in Hawaii, a variety which con tains largely of iron (see above), and becomes rusty yeUow on exposure ; in guano from the Chin cha Islands. The 3As Sfppppjp'ipjm'!, sal-ammouiac of Dioscorides, Celsius, and Pliny, is proved by Beckmann (Hist. of Inventions, iv. 360) to be common rock salt, dug in Egypt, near the oracle of Ammon. The name was afterward transferred to the muriate of ammonia, when subsequently manufactured in Egypt. Sal-ammoniac is supposed to have been included by the ancients, with one or two other species, uudor the name of nitrum, which, according to Pliny, gave the test of ammonia when mingled with quicklime. 140.

Antozonite of Schoubein. The dark violet-blue fluor of Wolsendorf, Bavaria, afforded Selirot ter 0'02 p. c. of ozone, which Schonbeiu (J. pr. Ch., lxxxiii. 95, lxxxix. 7) showed to be antozone, whence his name for this variety. Its strong antozone odor is said often to produce headache and vomiting iu the miners. Schafhautl states (Ann. Ch. Pharm., xlvi. 344) that this fluor con tains, Nitrogen 0-02073, hydrogen 0-00584, carbon 0-0365, chlorous acid 0*08692. But Wyroubofi discredits, in part, his results ; ho himself obtained Carbon 0*0170, hydrogen 0-0038, with Sl 0-0180, Fe 0*0032, Fe 0-0025, Cl 0-0071. Wyrouboff attributes the various colors to compounds of carbon and hydrogen, derived from a slight infusion of organic matters in the solvent waters; he found (Bulk Soc. Ch., II. v. 334, 1866) that the blue and violet colors changed to purple on heating, and supposes that two C H substances, a blue and a red, were present, the former more volatile, and therefore leaving the color reddish after partial heating.

At a high temperature it ceases, but is partiaUy restored by an electric discharge. Obs.\u2014 Sometimes in beds, but generally in veins, in gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and also it limestones, both crystalline and uncrystafline, and sandstones. Often occurs as the gangue of metallic ores. In the North of England, it is the gangue of the lead veins, which intersect the co.il formation in Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire; the Cumberland fluor often contains drops of fluid within, especiaUy the green variety (Greg and Lettsom). In Derby shire it is abundant, and also in Cornwall, where the veins intersect metamorphic rocks. Common in tho mining district of Saxony; fine near Kongsberg in Norway. In the dolomites of St. Gothard it occurs in pink octahedrons; at Miinsterthal in Baden in flesh-red hexoetahedrons. It has been detected in cannel coal by Prof. Rogers. In Maine, on Long Island, Blue Hill Bay, in veins. In N. Hampshire, at N. village of West moreland, 2 m.

Soluble in sulphuric acid, with evolution of hydrofluoric acid. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in a bay in Arksut-flord, iu West Greenland, at Evigtok, about 12 m. from the Danish settlement of Arksut, where it constitutes a large bed or vein in gneiss, and contains galenite, sphalerite, siderite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, fluorite, columbite, cassiterite, all often in fiue crystals. The exposure of the cryolite is about 300 feet in length. It is shipped in large quantities to Europe, and to the United States (Pennsylvania), where it is used for making soda, and soda and alumina salts ; also of late, in Pennsylvania, for the manufacture of a white glass which is a very good imitation of porcelain. It has also been used for the manufacture of aluminum. The first specimens of cryolite came through Denmark from Greenland, and the earliest notice of it was by \u2022Schumacher in the Abh. Nat. Ges. Copenhagen, iv. 1795. The locality was described from personal observation by Giesecke in Ed. Encyc, x. 97, aud Ed. PhU. J., vi. 141, 1822 ; and re cently by J. W. Taylor in the Q. J. G. Soc, xii. 140. Taylor states that the cryolite is not white, except within 10 to 15 feet from the surface, and that below this it becomes dark-colored, and even black. He attributes the bleaching above to the heat of two trap-dykes ; but as the dykes are not iu contact with the cryolite, and the evidence is not clear that they ever overlaid it, this cause may be questioned. The contained ores and other minerals are most abundant near the junction with the gneiss. Dr. Hagemann described the crystals (Am. J. Sci., II. xUi. 268) as orthorhombic. The author obtained the above figures from specimens kindly furnished by Dr. H. They occur implanted on the massive cryolite. The twin, by the absence of a reentering angle on plane O, appears to prove that the form is orthorhombic and not obUque. Yet Descloizeaux states that the optical characters, as observed by him, indicate a monoclinic form. Owing to the striations of the crys tals and their minuteness, the measurements of the author were not very satisfactory. O A l-i, in front, gave 126\u00b0 40' (5 measurements 126\u00b0 30'\u2014 126\" 40', and three of them 126\u00b0 40'), Oa 1-i, back, 125\u00b0 10' \u2014 125\u00b0 37', OAl-i about 126\u00b0, 1-f A 2-2 about 159\u00b0 40, 0A1 about 115\u00b0 30', l-i, front, A l-l, back,*=:710 25'.

The crystals often have an ochre-colored coating, especiaUy the terminal portion ; and on this account, and the striated tapering sides, the measurements are only approximations. The mineral 9"], [186, "130 FLUORINE COMPOUNDS. was first noticed by Dr. Julius Thomsen of Copenhagen, the originator of the cryolite industry, after whom it is here named. It differs strikingly from pachnolite in its pearly basal cleavage and its nearly square prisms ; and from cryolite in the horizontal stri\u00e6 of the same and the faeUity of cleavage. The compact variety, first observed by Dr. Hagemann (to whom the author is indebted for his acquaintance with it), has much of the aspect of chalcedony ; it incrusts cryolite or occu pies seams or cavities in it, and is covered by the chalky gearksutite ; the incrustations are some times half an inch or more thick. 169A, Hagemaunite.

Admitting the principle stated on page 33, that in oxyds crystallizing in the hexagonal system the number of atoms of the negative element, oxygen, is 3, or a multiple of 3 ; and that in those crystallizing in the tetragonal system this number is 2 or 4, or a multiple of 4 ; and that the sesquioxyds Fe2 O3, Al2 O3 are hexagonal speciea in accordance with this principle, and the deutoxyds Ti 02, Sn O2 are tetragonal in exemplification of it,* we have reasons for the foUowing conclusions. In the Zincite group, since water (ice) and zincite are hexagonal, these species, when thus crystallized (whatever be true in other states), may have the formulas H3 O3, and Zn3 O3. In the Massicot group, since the two species mentioned occur both in isometric and orthorhombic forms ; and since the orthorhombic form is in angle * The principle does not require that when the number of atoms of oxygen is 2 or 4, or a multiple of 4, that the forms should be necessarily tetragonal, but recognizes that tetragonal forms are then possible. The oxyd Ti O2 crystallized not only in tetragonal forms, but also in orthorhombic."], [189, "133 ANHYDROUS OXYDS. closely like that of orthorhombic Ti 02 (brookite), the angles I Al and. I A i being 99\u00b0 39', 126\u00b0 29' in cuprite, and 99\" 50, 126\u00b0 15' in brookite, it would seem to be true that while the isometric kinds have the formulas Pb 0 aud Cu 0, as ordinarily written, the orthorhombic have the formulas Pb2 0' and Cu** 0'- (or Ou O2); and that the latter ought to be arranged with the deutoxyds, in the same group with brookite, which also has 2 of oxygen. (This arrangement would have been adopted above, if distinct orthorhombic forms of the species had been observed iu nature.) Again, under the Rutile group are arrauged the species hausmannite and braunite, ores of man ganese. The formula of hausmannite is commonly written Mn Mu, making it analogous to species of the Spinel group. But it accords better with its tetragonal crystallization and its rela tions to Ti O2, to write it Mn2 Mn. Braunite has been shown by Rammelsberg to have a compo sition that may be represented by the formula (Mn Si)2 O3, in which Mn and Si appear as replacing one another. The constituents, as deduced by analysts, are 3 Sn + Mn + Si, which include 8 of Mn and Si to 12 of oxygen, in accordance with the above formula. But braunite has closely the crystallization of Ti O2 in rutile ; and this relation is brought out in the formula 2 Mn2 Mn + Mn Si, above given, which represents it as corresponding to 2 of hausmannite aud 2 of a silicate analo gous to zircon, with which silicate also it is isomorphous. The close relation and isomorphism of Jin and Si assumed in the formula (Mn, Si)2 O3 is unsustained by facts. 1. PEOTOXYDS. 172. CUPRITE. Aes caldarium rubro-fuscum, Germ.

Marcylite Shepard (Marcy's Expl. Red River, 135, 1854, Shep. Min., 1857, 405) is an uncertain mixture from the Red River, near tbe Wachita Mts., Arkansas. Shepard made it (L c.) a mixed hydrous chlorid and oxyd of copper, as if containing atacamite. Specimens put by him into the hands of S. W. Tyler for analysis were found to contain (Am. J. Sci., II. xli. Ill) 63*42 p. c. of copper and 17-22 of sulphur, with a \" supposed \" amount of oxygen aud water set down at 8 of oxygen and 9 of water, whence it is supposed to consist of oxyd of copper (Cu O) 39*70, sulphid of copper (Cu S) 47*70, with 9 of water. It is evidently a result of the alteration of a sulphid of copper. 2. SESQUIOXYDS. 179. CORUNDUM. Corindon (=Sapphire, Corundum, and Emery united) H., Gilb.

Friction excites electricity, and in polished specimens the electrical attraction continues for a considerable length of time. Obs. \u2014This species is associated with crystalline rocks, as granular limestone or dolomite, gneiss, granite, mica slate, chlorite slate. The fine sapphires are usually obtained from the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of mag netic iron ore, and several species of gems. The emery of Asia Minor, according to Dr. Smith, occurs in granular limestone. . The best ruby sapphires occur in the Capelan mountains, near Syrian, a city of Pegu, and in the kingdom of Ava ; smaller individuals occur near Bilin and Merowitz in Bohemia, and in the sand of the Expailly river in Auvergne. Blue sapphires are brought from Ceylon ; this variety was called Salamsiein by Werner. Corundum occurs in the Carnatic on the Malabar coast, in the territories of Ava, and elsewhere in the East Indies ; also near Canton, China. At St. Gothard, it occurs of a red or blue tinge in dolomite, aud near Mozzo in Piedmont, in white compact feld spar. Adamantine spar is met with in large coarse hexagonal pyramids on the Malabar coast, and in Gellivara, Sweden. Emery is found in large boulders at Naxos, Nicaria, and Samos of the Grecian islands; also in Asia Minor, 12 m. E. of Ephesus, near Gumuch-dagh, where it was discovered in situ by Dr. J. Lawrence Smith, associated with margarite, chloritoid, pyrite, calcite, etc, ;^and also at Kulah, Adula, and Manser, the last 24 m. N. of Smyrna ; also with the nacrite (?) of Cum berland. England.

In Pennsylvania, in Delaware Co., in Aston, near Village Green, in largo crystals; at Mineral Hill, in loose cryst. ; in Chester Co., at Unionville, abundant id crystals, some masses weighing 4,000 lbs., and crystals occasionally 4 in. long, with tourmaline, margarite, and albite. In N. Carolina, in Buncombe Co., blue massive, cleavable, in a boulder; in Gaston Co., crystals and massive corundum. In Georgia, in Cherokee Co., red sapphire. In California, in Los Angelea Co., in the drift of San Francisqueto Pass. In Canada, at Burgess, red and blue crystals. A so called emery from Arrowsic, Maine, ground aud sold under this name, is nothing but massive garnet, much of it mixed with hornblende. Red sapphire is the most highly esteemed. A crystal weighing four carats, perfect in trans parency and color, has been valued at half the price of a diamond of the same size. They seldom exceed half an inch in length. Two spleudid red crystals, however, having the form of the pyramidal dodecahedron, and \" de la longueur du petit doigt,\" with a diameter of about an inch, are said to be in the possession of the king of Arracau. Tran.3parent blue sapphires are some times over three inches long. The sapphire of the Greek (aampetpas) was the lapis lazuli, which agrees with the character given it by Theophrastus, Pliny, Isidorus, and others. Pliny remarks, \"Sapphirus c\u0153ruleug est cum purpura, habeus pulveres aureos sparsos,\" particles of pyrite which are frequently dis seminated through lapis lazuli, looking like gold. The ancient names applied to the species have already been given in the synonymy. See further on this subject, King on Precious Stones. C. U. Shepard, after showing (Descr. of Em. of Chester, Mass., London, 1865) that the Chester emery is identical crystallographically with corundum, takes the precaution to propose the name emerite for emery, in case it should hereafter be established as a distinct species. But a name thus given has no claim to recognition. Alt. \u2014 Corundum under some circumstances absorbs water and changes to diaspore; and perhaps also to the mica-like mineral margarite. It is also replaced by silica, forming quartz pseudomorphs. Artif. \u2014 Formed in crystals by exposing to a high heat 4 pts. of borax and 1 of alumina (Ebel men) ; by decomposing potash alum by charcoal (Gaudin) ; by subjecting in a carbon vessel fluorid of aluminum to the action of boric acid, the process yielding large rhombohedral plates (Deville &, Caron) ; by addition to the last of fluorid of chromium, affording the red sapphire or ruby, or with less of the fluorid of chromium, blue sapphire, or with much of this chrome fluorid, a fine green kind ; by action of chlorid of aluminum on lime (Daubree). 180.

(c) When oolitic in structure (consisting of minute flattened concretions), it is tho lenticular iron ore. Itabiryte is a schist resembling mica-schist, but containing much specular oro in grains or scales or in the micaceous form. Breithaupt states that some rhombohedrons of hematite have a magnetic axis crossing obliquely the vertical axis, passing between two opposite lateral angles (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 149) ; and further ihat the three cleavages of the rhombohedron are not quite equal.

With soda on charcoal in R.F. is reduced to a gray magnetic metallic powder. Soluble in concentrated muriatic acid. Obs.\u2014 This ore occurs in rocks of all ages, The specular variety is mostly confined to crystal line or metamorphic rocks, but is also a result of igneous action about some volcanoes, as at Vesu- vius. Many of the geological formations contain the argillaceous variety or clay iron-stone, which is mostly a marsh-formation, or a deposit over the bottom of shallow, stagnant water ; but this kind of clay iron-stone (that giving a red powder) is less common than the corresponding variety of limonite or siderite. The beds that occur in metamorphic rocks are sometimes of very great thickness, and, like those of magnetite in the same situation, have resulted from the alteration of stratified beds of ore, originally of marsh origin, which were formed at the same time with the enclos- ing rocks, and underwent metamorphism, or a change to the crystalline condition, at the same time. Beautiful crystallizations of this species are brought from the island of Elba, which has afforded it from a very remote period, and is described by Ovid a3 \" Insula inexhaustis chalybdum generosa metallis.\" The surfaces of the crystals often present an irised tarnish and brilliant lustre ; the faces 0 and J are usually destitute of this tarnish and lustre, and may therefore assist, when present, in determining the situation of other planes when the crystal is quite complex. St. Gothard affords beautiful specimens, composed of crystallized plates grouped in the form of rosettes (Eisenrose), and accompanying crystals of feldspar. Near Limoges, France, it occurs in large crystals. Fine crystals are the result of volcanic action at Etna and Vesuvius, and particularly in Fossa Cancharone, on Monte Somma, where it incrusts the ejected lavas ; also formed in most recent eruptions about the fumeroles; in that of 1855, in fine crystallizations about the fumaroles some so thin as to be blood-red by transmitted light (Scacchi). Arendal in Norway, Longban in Sweden, Framont in Lorraine, Dauphiny, and Switzerland, also Cleator Moor in Cumberland, afford splendid specimens. Red hematite occurs in reniform masses of a fibrous concentric structure, near Ulverstone in Lancashire, in Saxony, Bohemia, and the Harz. In Westphalia it occurs as pseudomorphs of calcite. In Brazil it is associated with quartz. In Chili there are immense beds. In N. America, widely distributed, and sometimes in beds of vast thickness in rocks of the Azoic age, as iu the Marquette region in northern Michigan ; and in Missouri, at the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mtn. ; the former 650 feet high, consisting mainly of au .Azoic quartz rock, and hav ing specular iron in the upper part, the iron ore in heavy beds interlaminated with quartz ; the latter 200 feet high, and consisting at surface of massive hematite in loose blocks, many 10 to 20 tons in weight ; in Arizona and New Mexico. Besides these regions of enormous beds, there are numerous others of workable value, either crystallized or argillaceous. Some of these localities, interesting for their specimens, are in northern New York, at Gouverneur, Antwerp, Hermon, Edwards, Fowler, Canton, etc.; Woodstock and Aroostook, Me. ; at Hawley, Mass., a micaceous variety ; at Piermont, N. H., id. ; in New York, in Oneida, Herkimer, Madison, Wayne Cos., a lenticular argillaceous var., constituting one or two , beds in the Upper Silurian; the same in Pennsylvania, and as far south as Alabama; and in Canada, aud Wisconsin to the west ; in North aud South Carolina a micaceous variety in schistose rocks, constituting the so-called specular schist, or itabirite. This ore affords a considerable portion of the iron manufactured in different countries. The varieties, especially the specular, require a pgreater degree of heat to smelt than other ores, but the iron obtained is of good quality. Pulverized red hematite is employed in polishing metals, and also as a coloring material. This species is readily distinguished from magnetite by its red streak, and from turgite by its greater hardness and its not decrepitating before the blowpipe. Named hematite from iipa, blood, it seeming, says Theophrastus, as if formed of concreted blood This old Greek author speaks afterwards of a second kind of hematites ('Ap^piv-ir;,! lavBii), which was of a yellowish-white color, probably a yellow ochre, an impure form of limonite, the species long called brown hematite. Alt \u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter forms magnetite or protoxyds ; and from the latter comes spathic iron by combination with carbonic acid ; or by further deoxydation through sul phuretted hydrogen forms pyrite. By combination with water forms limonite. Limonite, mag netite, and pyrite constitute occurring pseudomorphs after hematite. Artif. \u2014 Formed in crystals by the action of steam on chlorid of iron, regarded as the probable methods of origin of the hematite of lavas ; also by the action of perchlorid of iron on lime (Daubre'e); by the action of a stream of muriatic acid gas ou Pe, the application being made very slowly, lest the Pe be all converted to chlorid. 180A.

Whether the crystals of martite are original crystals or pseudomorphs is still questioned ; but the latter seems to be the most probable view. Pseudomorphism after magnetite would imply that the Marquette ore bed was once all magnetite in composition, Fe3 O'1, and has been changed to the sesquioxyd, Fe2 O3, by an addition of oxygen. Rammelsberg found 1*83 \u2014 2-30 p. c. of prot oxyd of iron in the Brazil crystals. The octahedrons from the fumeroles of Vesuvius afforded Eammelsberg (Min. Ch., 159) Pe 92*91, Fe 6*17, Mg 0*82=99*90. The crystals from Frassem, France, contain 0-2 p. c. of sulphur, which suggests that these may be pseudomorphs after pyrite 181. MENACCANITE.

Rose made the formula mfi+n Pe, assuming that the Fe obtained in the analyses arose from the oxydation of a supposed titanic oxyd (Ti2 O3) at the expense of the Pe. This view is not sustained, since it has been proved that the Fe exists as such in the ore. For other analyses : fr. Harzburg in Gabbro, Streng, B. H. Ztg., xxiii. 55 ; fr.

The pulverized mineral, heated with muriatic acid, is slowly dissolved to a yellow solution, which, filtered from the undecomposed mineral and boiled with the addition of tin-foil, assumes a beautiful blue or violet color. Decomposed by fusion with bisulphate of soda or potash. Obs. \u2014 Tho principal European localities of this species have been enumerated above. One of the most remarkable is at Krageroe, Norway, where it occurs in veins or beds in diorite, which sometimes afford crystals weighing over 1 6 pounds. Fine crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, occur in Warwick, Amity, and Monroe, Orange Co., N. Y , imbedded in serpentine and white lime- stone, and associated with spinel, chondrodite, rutile, etc. ; also 4 m. west of Edenville, and near Greenwood furnace with spinel and chondrodite ; also at Chester and South Royalston, Mass. Vast deposits or beds of titanic ore occur at Bay St. Paul in Canada, in syenite ; one bed, 90 feet thick, continues on in view for 300 feet, and probably far beyond ; also in the Seignory of St. Francis, Beauce, mixed with magnetite as a bed 45 feet thick in serpentine ; G.=4-56\u2014 4-66 ; also with labradorite at Chateau Richer. Grains are found in the gold sand of California. 181A. Iserite. (Titaneisenstein pt., Magnetischer Eisen-Sand pt, Wern. Iserin (fr. Iser) We\u2122., Letztes Min., 26, 52, 1817, Hoffm.

The localitv of Iserwiese gave the name to this mineral. The titanic iron-sand is partly in octahedral forms, and this portion, if not all, is thc iserine. Yet it is stUl doubted whether the otahedrons are regular octahedrons, or whether they are acute rhombohedrous with truncated apices, and therefore true ilmenite. The lser-viese crystals, as analyzed by Rammelsberg (anaL 1), give for the ratio between the metals aud oxygen 2 : 2*33, which is much more oxygen than the formula R2 O3 requires, and is stUl further remote from that of magnetite. The ore from Sio- Fok, on the Platensee, as ana'yzed by v. Hauer (anal. 2), affords the general formula (Fe, Ti)2 0! + Fe203, equivalent to FeO Ti O2 -I- Fe2 O3 (or Fe ti + Pe). G.=4-817. The grains were is part octahedrons, and some with truncated angles. The sand on. the Mersey comes from the shores nearly opposite Liverpool, and is mixed with magnetite. This is indicated in the analysis, which affords the formula 3 Fe 0, Ti O2 (or 3 (Fe, Ti)2 03) + 5 Fe (or 5 of magnetite). Minute octahedrons occur at BaUycrogan, MuU of Cantyre, Sand from Miiggelsee, near Berlin, having G.=5*075, afforded Rammelsberg a similar composi tion, but with only 5*20 p. c. ti, it giving him the formula Fe 0 Ti 02+ 6 of magnetite. It is not stated that this sand is octahedral. The ore from Silberberg, near Bodenmais, in Bavaria, corre sponds nearly to 4\\ (Fe, Ti)2 03+ 8 Fe2 03, and therefore comes under the general formula R2 03. Waltershausen has obtained from octahedral crystals of an iron-sand from Etna (Vulk. Gest. 121), having G.=4*43, ti 12-38 and Pe 92*18=104*56. The analysis needs repetition, A. Knop obtained for a titanic iron-sand a composition corresponding to magnetite in atomic ratio, giving the ratio 1 : 1*25 between the metals and oxygen. See under Magnetite. Iserine is reported also from Bohemia, Saxony, Calabria, Puy-de-Dome in France. 182. PEROFSKITE. Perowskit G. Rose, Pogg., xlviii. 558, 1839, Reis. Ural., iL 128. Isometric, Eose (fr. Ural).

Obs. \u2014 Spinel occurs imbedded in -granular limestone, and with calcite in serpentine, gneiss, and allied rocks. It also occupies the cavities of masses ejected from some volcanoes. In Ceylon, in Siam, and other eastern countries, it occurs of beautiful colors, as roUed pebbles m the channels of rivers. Pleonaste is found at Candy, in Ceylou. At Aker, in Sweden, ia found a pale-blue and pearl-gray variety in limestone. Small black splendent crystals occur in the ancient ejected masses of Mount Somma, with mica and idocrase ; also in compact gehlenite at Monzoni, in the Fassa valley. From Amity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J., a distance of about 30 mdes, is a region of granular lime stone and serpentine, in which localities of spinel abound. At Amity crystals are occasionally 16 in. in diameter; and one coUected by Dr. Heron weighs 49 lbs. ; it is in three pieces, and contains cavities studded with crystals of corundum ; colors, green, black, brown, and less commonly red, along with chondrodite and other minerals. A mde S.W. of Amity, on. J. Layton's farm, is a remarkable locality; also ou W. Raynor's farm, a mile N. ; another half mile N. affording grayish red octahedrons ; and others to the south. Locahties are numerous about Warwick, and also at Monroe and Cornwall, though less favorable for exploration than those at Amity (form 1, also 1, i, 3-3, f. 147). Franklin, N. J., affords crystals of various shades of black, blue, green, and red, which are sometimes transparent, and a bluish-green ceylonite variety here, has the lustre of polished steel; Newton, N.

Obs, \u2014 Magnetite is mostly confined to crystaUine rocks, and is most abundant in metamorphic rocks, though found also in grains in eruptive rocks. In the Azoic rocks the bed3 are of immense extent, aud occur under tho same conditions as those of hematite (see p. 142). It is an ingredient in most of the massive variety of corundum called emery. The earthy magnetite is found in bogs like bog-iron ore. The beds of ore at Arendal, and uearly aU the celebrated iron mines of Sweden, consist of massive magnetite; Dannemora and the Taberg in Smaoland are entirely formed of it. Still larger mountains of it exist at Kurunavara and Gelivara, in Lapland. Fahlun in Sweden, and Corsica, afford octahedral crystals (f. 2), imbedded in chlorite slate. Splendid dodecahedral crystals occur at Normark in Wermland. The most powerful native magnets are found in Siberia, and in the Harz ; they are also obtained on the island of Elba. In N. America, it constitutes vast beds (some scores of feet thick) in the Azoic, iu the Adiron dack region, Warren, Essex, and Clinton Cos., in Northern N.

No ore of iron is more geueraUy diffused than the magnetic, and none superior for tho manu facture of iron. It is easily distinguished by its being attracted readily by the magnet, and also hy means of the black color of its streak or powder, which is some shade of red or brown iu hematite aud limonite. The ore when pulverized may be separated from earthy impurities by means of a magnet, and machines for this purpose are in use. Named from the loc. Magnesia, bordering on Macedonia. But Pliny favors Nicander's derivation from Magnes, who first discovered it, as the fable runs, by finding, on taking his herds to pasture, that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrule of his staff adhered to the ground. Alt. \u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter changed to protoxyd, which may become a car bonate or siderite. By oxydation becomes sesquioxyd of iron or hematite. Artif.\u2014 Formed in crystals by the action of chlorhydric acid on the sesquioxyd heated, producing a partial deoxydation (Deville); by decomposition of the sesquioxyd with boracic acid (DeviUe and Caron, Ann. Ch. Phys., IV. v. 108). 185A. Dimagnetite of Shepard (Am. J. Sci., II. xiii. 392) appears to be a magnetite pseudomorph. The slender rhombic prisms occur upon a surface which is covered with small cubo-octahedrons dodecahedrons, and cubo-dodecahedrous of magnetite, and some small irregular cavities iu tho dimagnetite crystals contain similar crystals ; moreover no difference of lustre is perceived in a fractured surface of the maguetite and dimagnetite. The species imitated in the pseudomorph is probably Lievrite. The angle of the prism varies between 110\u00b0 and 115\u00b0, according to the author's measurements (Shepard gives the angle \\30~). One crystal gave approximately 110\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 ; another 114\u00b0 20' and 65\u00b0 40' ; another 1 12\u00b0 and 68\u00b0, and the obtuse edge was bevelled in this last crystal by planes (i-2) inclined to the larger ones at an angte of about 160*r\u00b0.

Pyrolusite parts with its oxygen at a red heat, and is extensively employed for discharging the brown and green tints of glass. It hence received its name from irop, fire, and W<jj, to wash ; and for the same reason it is whimsically entitled by the French le savon de verriers. It is easUy distinguished from psilo melane by its inferior hardness, and usually by being crystalline. 200. CREDNERITE. Kupferhaltiges Mangauerz Credner, Jahrb. Min., 5, 1847.

Obs. \u2014 A very common ore of iron, often taken for limonite, with which it is frequently asso ciated, and which it resembles, except iu its superior hardness, streak, and decrepitation. It also looks very much like fibrous hematite. Hermann's mineral was from the Turginsk copper mine near Bosgolovsk, in the Ural, aud from the Kolyvan district, in the Altai ; that of Breithaupt, from near Hof in Bavaria, and Siegen in Prussia; found also with limonite at Dusseldorf in Prussia ; at the Louisa mine, Horhausen. In the United States it occurs abundantly, and very large botryoidal massive, at the limonite ore bed of Salisbury, Ct., as detected by Prof. Brush (Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 219), usually constituting the exterior layer of the limonite, sometimes an inch or more thick. The line of demarcation between it and the limonite is very distinct, and separation along it is often easy. Artif. \u2014 E. Davies has shown that the ordinary precipitate of hydrate of iron, on being boiled in water, may have its water reduced to 3-52 p. c. (J. Ch. Soc, II. iv. 69) ; and Rodman (1. c.) has, by the same method, reduced it to 2 p. c, showing that the water varies with the temperature of origin; and, as Davies observes, no great heat is needed to make thus anhydrous hematite. 203.

Diaspore was named by Haiiy from Sumiriipui, to scatter, alluding to the usual decrepitation before tbe blowpipe. Le Lievre, as Haiiy states, first made known the species, having found it at a mineral-dealer's in Paris, and given it to Vauquelin for analysis. Its original locality is not knorfn, but is supposed to have been the Urals. Vauquelin obtained alumina 80, oxyd of iron 3, water 16 to 18 = 100 (Haiiy, Tr., 1. c, and Ann.

The ochre analyzed by Hunt was from a bed in the soU having an extent of many acres ; the color Ught brownish-yellow. It may be a mixture of limonite and a hydrous species containing oxyd of iron combined with organic acids. Hunt suggests that it should be made a distinct spe cies; and when the exact nature ofthe organic acids is determined, this may properly be done. In other analyses of bog ores from VaudreuU and other places in Canada, Hunt found 16*50 to 23*65 p. c. of water and organic acids, but the proportion of the two was not determined. For other so-caUed limonite, bog ores, and ochres, see Xanthosiderite aud Limnite. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Like gothite. Some varieties give a skeleton of silica when fused with salt of phosphorus, and leave a siliceous residue when attacked by acida. Obs. \u2014 Limonite occurs iu secondary or more recent deposits, in beds associated at times with barite, siderite, calcite, aragonite, and quartz ; and often with ores of manganeso ; also as a modem marsh deposit. It is in all cases a result of the alteration of other ores, through exposure to moisture, air, and carbonic or organic acids ; and is derived largely from the change of pyrite, siderite, magnetite, and various mineral species (such as mica, augite, hornblende, etc.), which contain iron in tho protoxyd state. It consequently occupies, as a bog ore, marshy places, over most countries of the globe, into which it has been borne by streamlets from the hiUs around ; and in the more compact form it occurs in stalactites as weU as in tuberose and other concretionary forms, frequently mak ing beds in the rocks which contain the minerals that have been altered into it. In moist places where a sluggish streamlet flows into a marsh or pool, a rust-yeUow or brownish-yeUow deposit often covers the bottom, and an iridescent film the surface of the water : the deposit is a growing bed of bog ore. The iron is transported in solution as a protoxyd carbonate in carbonated waters, a sulphate, or as a salt of an organic acid. Tho limonite beds of the Greeu Mountain region were shown by Percival (Rep. G. Conn., 132, Am. J. Sci., II. ii. 268) to be altered bed3 of pyritiferou3 micaceous and argillaceous schist ; and tbe same is held by Lesley as true also of the other bed3 ofthe Atlantic border, from New England and New York, through Pennsylvania (Mt. Alto region and others), to Tenuessee and Alabama (Proc. Am. Ac. Philad., 463, 1864, Am. J. Sci., II. xl. 119). Abundant in ths United States. A few only of its localities are here mentioned ; reference may be made to the various geological reports for complete lists. Extensive beds exist at Salisbury and Kent, Conn., also in the neighboring towns of Beekman, Fishkdl, Dover, and Ameuia, N. Y., and in a similar situation north ; at Richmond and Lenox, Mass. ; at Hinsdale as the cement in a conglomerate quartz rock ; in Vermont, at Benniugton, Moukton, Pittsford, Putney, aud Ripton. Limonite is one of the most important ores of irou. The pig iron, from the purer varieties, ob tained by smelting with charcoal, is of superior quality. That yielded by bog ore is what is termed cold short, owing to the phosphorus present, and cannot therefore be employed in the man ufacture of wire, or even of sheet iron, but is valuable for casting. The hard and compact nodular varieties are employed in polishing metallic buttons, etc. Named Limonite from \\apio,; meadow. Ullmann's name, Stilpnosiderite, from onX-r,\"-!,-, shining, has priority ; but the ore is characteristicaUy not a shining ore, although sometimes with a lus trous, varnish-like exterior. The name limonite was first appropriated especiaUy to the bog ores by Hausmann iu 1813. But most bog ores are of the above species, and Beudant, recognizing this, in 1832 used limonite for the bog as weU as other limonite.

But the true gibbsite has since been analyzed anew by Silliman, Jr., and by Smith & Brush, without finding more than a trace of phosphoric acid, sustain iug tbe original analysis of Torrey.

Cleaveland calls the Richmond mineral hydrargillite on p. 224 of his mineralogy, but on p. 732 adopts Torrey's name gibbsite.

Glocker proposed this name as a substitute for limonite, on the alleged ground that the word limonite was of French extraction. As his limonite, or limnite, was bog ore exclusively, the name is appropriately used here. Hermann's name Quellerz alludes to its water or marsh origin. 214. HYDROTALCITE.

The Derbyshire wad sometimes gives the angle of barite, 101\u00b0 42', with which mineral it is in part impregnated. The wad of Leadhills is pseudomorphous aster calcite. Groroilite occurs in roundish masses of a brownish-black color, and reddish-brown streak; with H. sometimes 6\u20146*5; it is from Groroi in Mayenne, Vicdessos, and Cautern, in France. Beissacherite is the ore analyzed by Hornig (anal. 14), which is remarkable for the amount of water. Huot's name ouatite is from the French spelling of wad. Wad is of English origin.

Earthy cobalt gives a blue bead with salt of phos phorus, and when heated in R.F. on charcoal with tin, some specimens yield a red opaque bead (copper). Cupreous manganese gives similar reactions, and three varieties give a strong man ganese reaction with soda, and evolve chlorine when treated with muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 The above ores are results of the decomposition of other ores \u2014 partly of oxyds, and partly of manganesian carbonates. They occur at the localities above mentioned, and many other places. Wad or bog manganese is abundant in the counties of Columbia and Duchees, N. Y., at Austerlitz, Canaan Centre, and elsewhere, where it occurs as a marsh deposit, and, according to Mather, has proceeded from the alteration of brown spar ; also in the south-west part of Martinsburg, Lewis Co., in a swamp. There are large deposits of bog manganese at Blue Hill Bay, Dover, and other places in Maine. Earthy cobalt occurs with cobalt pyrites at Riechelsdorf in Hesse; Saalfeld in Thuringia: at Nertschinsk in Siberia; at Alderly Edge in Cheshire. An earthy cobalt occurs at Mine la Motte, Missouri, which contains 10 or 11 p. c. of oxyd of nickel, besides oxyd of cobalt and copper, with iron, lead, and sulphur; also near Silver Bluff, South Carolina, affording 24 p. c. of oxyd of cobalt to 76 of oxyd of manganese. Cupreous manganese is found at Schlackenwald, and at Kamsdorf near Saalfeld ; at Lauterberg in the Harz. Peloconite is from Remohnos, Chili, where it occurs with chrysocolla, or malachite. Varvacite.

The compound Sb 04 + H has been formed artificially; but its existence in nature appears still to be doubtful. Beudant mentions no particular locality. Blum & Delffs enumerate others besides Goldkronach in Bavaria, but evidently aim to include all localities of antimony ochre. Parizite of A. Arents (Am. J.

Tough \u2014 brittle \u2014 friable. Polarization circular, there being a colored centre instead of a central cross, and the rings of coloi around enlarging as the analyzer is turned to the right in right-handed crys tals (f. 192), or left in left-handed (f. 190) ; and colored spirals are seen, which rotate to the right or left, when the incident light and emergent light are polarized, one circularly and the other plane. For observing the polarization, plates of the crystal are cut at right angles to the axis. In twins the component parts may be both right-handed or both left-handed (as in those of Dauphiny and the Swiss Alps) ; or one may be of one kind and the other of the other. Moreover, succes sive layers of deposition (made as the crystal went on enlarging, and often exceedingly thin) are sometimes alternately right and left-handed, showing a constant oscillation of polarity in the course of its formation ; and, when this is the case, and the layers are regular, cross-sections, examined .ny polarized light, exhibit a division, more or less perfect, into sectors of 1 20\u00b0, parallel to the plane R, or into sectors of 60\u00b0. If the layers are of unequal thickness, there are broad areas of colors without sectors. In f. 199 (by Descloizeaux, from a crystal from the Dept. of the Aude), half of each sector of 60\u00b0 is right-handed, and the other half left (as shown by the arrows), and the dark radii are neutral bands produced by the overlapping of layers of the two kinds. In f. 200, from a 199 200 crystal of amethyst (also by Descloizeaux), the alternate white and black lines in each banded sector are due to alternate right and left-handed layers, parallel to R. The fact of a structure in layers ss easily made manifest by means of fluoric acid, it corroding successive layers unequally. The asteriated internal structure is often apparent in an asteriated arrangement of shades of color or of degrees of transparency. Biaxial polarization is sometimes a consequence of the composite structure (as in crystals from Euba, ipear Schemnitz). In crystals, the planes R and \u20141, when not distinguishable by different degrees of lustre, smoothness, or striation, may be by etching with fluoric ac-id, this process going on unequally in the two directions and producing a difference of surface, besides often developing the layers that were superimposed in the growth of the crystal, alluded to above.

Comp.\u2014 Pure silica, or Si=Oxygen 53*33, silicon 46*67 = 100. In massive varieties. Often mixed with a little opal-silica. Impure varieties contain oxyd of iron, carbonate of lime, clay, sand and various minerals. Quartz-silica has been supposed to be insoluble in a hot solution of potash, and to be thus distinguishable from opal-silica. But since the investigations of Rammels berg (Pogg., cxii. 1 77 ) it has been questioned whether in a very finely divided'state, and especially such as constitutes the compact (cryptocrystalline) chalcedony or flint, it is not more or less soluble. Rammelsberg subjected a number of kinds of quartz to the action of a hot potash solution, and the following are part of his results; under ign. and S the total loss is given, aud then, iu brackets, the part from drying over sulph uric acid \u2022"], [249, "QUAETZ, 193 Loss by ign. and S.

Jenzsch has announced (Pogg., cxxvi. 497) that there is a second modification of amorphous silica, distinct from opal, and hitherto unrecognized (see under Opal), having G. = 2-6, like quartz. This suggests an explanation ofthe above. But the hyalite variety of opal, having G. = 2-185, gave Rammelsberg 9*6 to 19\"9 p. c. of insoluble silica. To explain this fact by the same method still another modification of sdica would be required \u2014 an insoluble kind, having the low specific gravity of opal. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. alone unaltered. With soda dissolves with effervescence ; unacted upon by salt of phosphorus. Soluble only in fluohydric acid. Var. \u2014 1. Crystallized (phenocrystaUine), vitreous in lustre. 2. Flint-like massive, or crypto crystalline. The first division includes all ordinary vitreous quartz, whether having crystalline faces or not. The varieties under the second are in general acted upon somewhat more by attrition, and by chemical agents, as fluoric acid, than those of the first. In all kinds made up of layers, as agate, successive layers are unequally eroded. A. Phexocrystallt*!**!\"* oe Vitreous Varieties. 1. Ordinary Crystallized ; Rock Crystal Colorless quartz, or nearly so, whether in distinct crys tals or not. (a) Regular crystals, or limpid quartz ; (b) right-handed crystals ; (c) left-handed ; (pi) cavernous crystals, having deep cavities parallel to the faces \u2014 occasioned by the interference of impurities during their formation ; (e) cap-quartz, made up of separable layers or caps, due to the deposit of a little clayey material at intervals in the progress of the crystal ; (/) drusy quartz, a crust of small or minute quartz crystals ; (g) radiated quartz, often separable into radiated parts having pyramidal terminations; (h) fibrous, rarely delicately so, as a kind from Orange river, near Cape of Good Hope. 2. Asteriated; Star-quartz (Stern-quartz Germ.). Containing within the crystal whitish or colored radiations along the diametral planes. Part if not all asteriated quartz is asteriated in polarization, as above described. 3. Amethystine; Amethyst (A/itfluirroi. Theophr., etc.). Clear purple, or bluish-violet. Tho coior is supposed to be due to manganese. But Heintz obtained in an analysis of a Brazilian specimen, besides silica, 0-0187 oxyd of iron, 0-6236 lime, 0-0133 magnesia, and 00418 soda; and he con siders the color owing to a compound of irou and soda. The structure is composite, as illustrated in f. 199, 200, and tho shade of violet is usually deepest parallel to the planes R. 4. Rose. Rose-red or pink, but becoming paler on exposure. Common massive, and then usually much cracked. Lustre sometimes a little greasy. Fuchs states that the color is due to titanic acid; he found 1 to 1| p. c. in specimens from Rabenstein, near Bodenmais. It may come in part from manganese. 5. Yellow ; False Topaz. Yellow and pellucid, or nearly so ; resembling somewhat yellow topaz, hut very different in crystallization and in absence of cleavage. 6. Smoky, Cairngorm Stone (Mormorion Plin., xxxvii. 63). Smoky-yellow to smoky-brown, and often transparent; but varying to brownish-black, and then nearly opaque in thick crystals. The color is probably due to titanic acid, as crystals containing rutile are usually smoky. Called Cairngorms from the locality at Cairngorum, S.W. of Banff, in Scotland. 7. Milky. Milk-white and nearly opaque. Lustre often greasy, and then called greasy quartz. 8. Siderite, or Sapphire-quartz. Of indigo or Berlin-blue color; a variety occurring in an impure limestone at Golling in Saltzburg. 9. Sagenitic. Containing within acicular crystals of .other minerals. These acicular crystals are most commonly (a) rutile, the mineral called from such specimens sagenite (fr. cu-yni-n, a net) by de Saussure (see under Rutile). They may also be (6) black tourmaline ; (c) gothite ; (pi) stibnite ; (e) asbestus; (/) actinolite; (g) hornblende ; (A) epidote. 10. Cats Eye (Katzenauge Germ., \u0152il de Chat Fr.). Exhibiting opalescence, but without pris matic colors, especially when cut en cabochon, an effect due to fibres of asbestus. 1 1. Aventurine. Spangled with scales of mica or other mineral. 12. Impure from the presence of distinct minerals distributed densely through tho mass. The more common kinds are those in which the impurities are: (a) ferruginous, either red or yellow oxyd of iron; (6) chloritic, some kind of chlorite; (c) actinolitic ,* (d) micaceous; (e) arenaceous, or sand. 13"], [250, "194 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. Quartz crystals also occur penetrated by various minerals, as topaz, corundum, chrysoberyl garnet, different species of the hornblende aud pyroxene groups, kyanite, zeolites, calcite and other carbonates, rutile, stibnite, hematite, gothite, magnetite, fluorite, gold, silver, anthracite, etc. As quartz has been crystallized through the aid of hot waters or of steam iu all ages down to the present, and is tho most common ingredient of rocks, there is good reason why it should be found thus the enveloper of other crystals. 13. Containing liquids in cavities. These liquids are seen to move with the change of position of the crystal, provided an air-bubble be present in the cavity; they may be detected also by the refraction of light. The liquid is either water (pure, or a mineral solution), or some petroleum-like or other compound. (See p. 761.) B. Cryptocrystalline Varieties. i. CJiatcedony (Murrhina Plin., xxxvii. 7. laams pt. Theophr. Iaspis pt. Plin., xxxvii. 37 Murrhina, Germ. Chalcedonius, Agric., 466, 1546, Chalcedon, Achates vix pellucida, nebulosa, colore griseo mixta, Wall., 83, 1747. Calcedoine Fr.). Having the lustre nearly of wax, and either transparent or translucent. Color white, grayish, pale-brown to dark-brown, black; tendon-color common; sometimes delicate blue. Also of other shades, and then having other names. Often mammillary, botryoidal, stalactitic, and occurring lining or filling cavities in rocks. It is true quartz, with some disseminated opal-quartz. A grav chalcedony from Hungary afforded Redtenbacher (Ramm. Min. Ch., 1007) Si 98*87, Pe 0-53, Ca C 0-62=100*02. 2. Carnelian (EpWio.. Theophr. Sarda Plin., xxxvii. 23, id.= Germ. Carneol, Agric, 468, 1546. Carneol, Agates fere pellucida, colore rubescente, Wall, 82, 1747. Cornaline Fr.). A clear red chalcedony, pale to deep in shade ; also brownish-red to brown, the latter kind (Sardoine Ir.) reddish-brown by transmitted light. Heintz found that the red color was due to oxyd of iron, obtaining in an analysis fe 0050 p. c, 3:1 0*081, Mg 0*028, K 0*0043, Na 0*075. It has been supposed to be of organic origin. 3. Chrysoprase (not Chrysoprasus antiq.). An apple-green chalcedony, the color due to the presence of oxyd of nickel. Klaproth found in that of Silesia (Beitr., ii. 127) Si 96*16, \u25a0&[ 0'08, Fe 0-08, Ni 1*0, Ca 0*83, H 1*85 = 100; and Rammelsberg, in the same (Pogg., cxii. 188), Si 97-00, fe, Ni 0-41, Ca, Mg 0*51, H 2-08. 4. Prase. Translucent and dull leek-green ; so named from jrpimi; a leek. Always regarded as a stone of little value. The name is also given to crystalline quartz ofthe same color. \"Vilioris est turb\u00e6 Prasius,\" says Pliny. 5. Plasma (Iaspis pt. Plin., xxxvii. 37). Rather bright-green to leek-green, and also sometimes nearly emerald-green, and subtranslucent or feebly translucent ; sometimes dotted with white. Heliotrope, or Blood-stone, is the same stone essentially, with small spots of red jasper, looking hke drops of blood. The Iaspis, or jasper of the ancients, was a semitransparent or translucent stone, and included in Pliny's time all bright-colored chalcedony excepting the carnelian (Sard). He gives special prominence to sky-blue and green, and mentions also a shade of purple (the color of the best, he says), a rose color, the color of the morning sky in autumn, sea-green, terebenthine color (yellow like turpentine, as interpreted by King), smoke-color (his capnias), etc. ; but in general there is a tinge of blue, whatever the shade. The green kinds may have been chrysoprase or plasma; or perhaps a variety of jade, a stone known in Europe since the Stone age. The green, with a line running through it (Monogrammos), may have been plasma, or jade, with a narrow seam of white quartz. .Pliny's Prasius, spotted with red, was our heliotrope ; his Heliotrope (xxxvii. 60) was a leek green stone (prase or plasma) veined with blood-red (jasper); and the jasper was so abundant a part a3 to give a general red reflection to the whole when it w-as put in water in the face of the sun, whence the name from jJAios, sun, aud rpl-ui, lo turn. 6. Agate ('Axdri,s [fr. Sicily] Theophr. Achates pt. Plin., xxxvii. 54. Onyx pt. Plin., ib, 24). A variegated chalcedony. The colors are either (.<) banded ; or (IS) in clouds ; or (y) due to visible impurities. a. Banded. The bands are delicate parallel lines, of white, tendon-like, wax-like, pale and dark brown, and black colors, and sometimes bluish and other shades. They follow waving cr zigzag courses, and are occasionally concentric circular, as in the eye-agate (Leucophthalmus Plin., xxxvii 62, and Triophihalmus ib., 7 1). The fine translucent agates graduated into coarse aud opaque kinds. The bands are the edges of layers of deposition, the agate having been formed by a deposit of silica from solutions intermittently supplied, in irregular cavities in rocks, and deriving their con centric waving courses from the irregularities of the walls of the cavity. As the cavity cannot contain enough of the solution to fill it with silica, an open hole has been supposed to be retained on oneside to permit the continued supply ; but it is more probable that it passes through the outei"], [251, "195 QUAETZ, layers by osmosis, the denser solution outside thus supplying silica as fast as it is deposited with in. The colors are due to traces of organic matter, or of oxyds of iron, manganese, or titanium, and largely to differences in rate of deposition. The layers differ in porosity, and therefore in the rate at which they are etched by fluoric acid ; and consequently the etching process brings out the different layers, and makes engravings that will print exact pictures of the agate. Owing also to the unequal porosity, agates may be varied in color by artificial means. A brown banded agate afforded Redtenbacher (Ramm. Min. Ch., 1007) Si ('8-91, fe 0-72, Ca C 0-31=99*94. 0. Irregularly clouded. The colors various, as in banded agate. _ A whitish clouded var. (a) is probably the Leucachates Plin. (fr. Xtmtft, white) ; (b) a wax-colored, his Cerachates (fr. cera, wax), a name that may have been applied also to ordinary wax-colored chalcedony, as the stone was one iu little repute ; (c) a reddish, his Sardachates, or carneliau-agate. The last probably included also banded kinds. Hemachate\u00e6 (fr. a*>p7, blood) was probably a truo light-colored agate, blotched with red jasper, \"blushing with spots of blood,\" as says Solinus (King, p. 207), of which there are very beautiful kinds, and not simple red jasper. Iaspachales must have been an agate in which bluish and greenish shades (Iaspis) predominated. These names are given by Pliny without accompanying descriptions. y. Colors dm to vi.sibl: impurities, (a) Moss-agate, or Mocha-atone, filled with brown moss-like or dendritic forms distributed through the mass. (6) Dendritic Agate, containing brown or black dendritic markings. These two are the Dendrachates Plin. (fr. Sivfyov, a tree). There is also 6. Agatized wood : wood petrified with clouded agate. 7. Onyx ('Ouii^iou Theophr. Onyx pt. [rest agate, stalagmite, q. v.] Plin., xxxvii. 24) Like agate in consisting of layers of different colors, but the layers aro in even planes, and the banding (inerefore straight, and hence its use for cameos, the head being cut in one color, and another serving for the background. The colors of the best are perfectly well defined, and either white and black, or white, brown and black alternate. 8. Sardonyx (Plin., xxxvii. 23). Like onyx iu structure, but includes layers of carnelian (sard) along -*vith others of white or whitish, and brown, and sometimes black colors. 9. Agate-Jasper. An agate consisting ofjasper with veinings and cloudings of chalcedony. 10. Silicious sinter. Irregularly cellular quartz, formed by deposition from waters containing Bilica or soluble silicates in solution. 11. Flint (Silex pt. Plin., Feuerstein Germ.). Somewhat allied to chalcedony, but more opaque, and of dull colors, usually gray, smoky-brown, and brownish-black. The exterior is often whitish, from mixture with lime or chalk, in which it is imbedded. Lustro barely glistening, subvitreous. Breaks with a deeply conchoidal fracture, and a sharp cutting edge. Tho flint of the chalk forma tion consists largely of the remains of infusoria (Diatoms), sponges, and other marine productions. The silica of flint, according to Fuchs, is partly soluble silica. See on this point p. 104. There is usually one per cent, or so of alumina aud peroxyd of iron, with one or two of water. The coloring matter ofthe common kinds is mostly carbonaceous matter. 12. Hornstone (Silex pt, Plin., llorr.stein Germ.). Resembles flint, but more brittle, the frac ture more splintery. Chert is a term often applied to hornstone, and to any impure flinty rock, including the jaspers. A grayish chalcedonic hornstone from Marienbad afforded Kersten Si 90-30, Al 3-10, fe 1-73, Mg 1-28, Cu 0*94, Na and K 0 70, fl 1*95 (Jahrb. Min., 1845, 656). 13. Basanite, Lydian Stone, or Touchstone (Lapis Lydius Plin., xxxiii. 43, ? Basanites id., xxxvi. 11). A velvet-black siliceous stone or flinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black color for trying the purity of the precious metals. The color left on the stone after rubbing tho metal across it indicates to the experienced eyo the amount of alloy. It is not splintery like hornstone. It passes into a compact, fissile, siliceous, or flinty rock, of grayish and other colors, called siliceous slate, and also Phthanyte ; and then resembles ordinary jasper of grayish and other shades, especially the banded jaspers. 14. Jasper. Impure opaque colored quartz, (a) Red (H\u00e6matitis Plin., xxxvii. c. 60, not his H\u00e6matites), sesquioxyd of iron being the coloring matter. (6) Brownish, or ochre yellow, colored by hydrous sesquioxyd of iron, aud becoming red when so heated as to drive off the water, (c) Dark green and brownish-green, (d) Grayish-blue, (e) Blackish or brownish-black, (f) Striped or riband jasper (Baudjaspis Germ.), having the colors in broad stripes, (g) Egyptian jasper, in nodules which are zoned in brown and yellowish colors. Porcelain jasper is nothing but baked clay, and differs from true jasper in being B.B. fus'ble ou the edges. Red porphyry, or its base, resembles jasper, but is also fusible on the edges, being usually an impure feldspar. C. Besides the above there are also : \u2014 1. Granular Quartz, or Quartz-rock. A rock consisting of quartz grains very firmly compacted , the grains often hardly distinct. 2. Quartzose Sandstone. 3. Quartz-conglomerate. A rock made of pebbles of quartz with sand. The pebbles sometimes are jasper and chalcedony, and mako a \"eautiful stone when polished 4. liacolumite, or Flexible Sandstone. A friable sand-roci, con"], [252, "196 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. sisting mainly of quartz sand, but containing a little talc, aud possessing a degree of nexi bility\u00b0whcn in thin lamin\u00e6. 5. Buhrstone. A cellular, flinty rock, having the nature in part o.' coarse chalcedony. 6. Pseudomorphous Quartz. Quartz appears also under the forms of many of the mineral species, which it has taken through either the alteration or replacement of crystals of those species. The most common quartz pseudomorphs are those of adcite, barite, fluorite, and siderite. (o) Tabulai quartz consists of intersecting plates of quartz, and is probably a result ofthe quartz being depos ited among intersecting plates of other minerals, as barite. (6) Haytorite of C. Tripe (Phil. Mag., i. 40, 1827) is a pseudomorph after datholite. (c) Beckite Duf. is a pseudomorph after coral, chalce donic in character, from Devonshire, England ; it contains some of the carbonate of lime of the original coral (Church, Phil. Mag., IT. xxiii. 95). (d) Babel-quartz is quartz which has impressions of cubes of fluor, arising from its having been deposited over the crystals, (e) Silicified shells are proper pseudomorphs in quartz; they occur through many rock strata, including limestones. (/' Silicified wood is quartz pseudomorph after wood. The texture of the original wood is usually well retained, it having been formed by the deposit of silica from its solution in the cells of the wood, and finally taking the place of the walls of the cells as the wood itself disappeared. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. unaltered ; with borax dissolves slowly to a clear glass ; with soda dissolves with effervescence ; unacted upon by salt of phosphorus. Insoluble in muriatic acid, and only slightly acted upon by solutions of fixed caustic alkalies. When fused and cooled it becomes opal silica, having G. = 2'2. Obs. \u2014 Quartz occurs as one ofthe essential constituents of granite, syenite, gneiss, mica schist, and many related rocks ; as the principal constituent of quartz-rock and many sandstones ; as an unessential ingredient in some trachj-te, porphyry, etc. ; as the vein-stone in various rocks, and for a large part of mineral veins ; as a foreign mineral in the cavities of trap, basalt, and related rocks, some limestones, etc., making geodes of crystals, or of chalcedony, agate, carnelian, etc. ; as imbedded nodules or masses in various limestones, constituting the flint of the chalk formation, the hornstone of other limestones \u2014 these nodules sometimes becoming continuous layers; os masses of jasper occasionally in limestone. It is the principal material of the pebbles of gravel beds, and of the sands of the sea-shore and sand beds everywhere. It is reported by G. Rose as occurring in the meteorite of Xiquipulco (Pogg., cxiii. 184). Silica also occurs in solution (but mostly as a soluble alkaline silicate) in heated natural waters, as those of the Geysers of Iceland, New Zealand, and California, and very sparingly in many cold mineral waters. Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries, and numerous other foreign localities, afford fine specimens of rock crystal. The most beautiful amethysts are brought from India, Ceylon, and Persia, where they occur in geodes, and as pebbles ; inferior specimens occur in Transylvania, in large crystalline groups ; in the vicinity of Cork, and on the island of May, Ireland. The false topaz is met with in Brazil. Rose quartz occurs in a vein of manganese, trav ersing the granite of Rabenstein, near Zwiesel iu Bavaria. Prase is found in the iron mines of Breitenbrunn, near Schwartzemberg in Saxony ; and in Brittany, near Nantes and Rennes. The amygdaloids of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, afford magnificent specimens of chalcedony ; also Hiittenberg aud Loben in Carinthia, etc. A smalt-blue variety, in cubical crystals (pseudomorphs of fluorite), occurs at Treszytan, iu Transylvania. The finest carnelians and agates are found in Arabia, India, Brazil, Surinam, Oberstein, and Saxony. Scotland affords smaller but handsomo specimens (Scotch pebbles). Chrysoprase, at Kosemiitz in Silesia. Aventurine quartz, at Cape de Gata in Spain. Cafs eye, in Ceylon, tbe coast of Malabar, and also iu the Harz and Bavaria. Plasma, in India and China, whence it is usually brought in the form of beads. Heliotrope, in Bucharia, Tartary, Siberia, and the island of Rum in the Hebrides. Float stone, in the chalk for mation of Meuil Montant, near Paris, and in some of tbe Cornish mines. Thc banks of the Nile afford the Egyptian jasper ; the striped jasper is met with in Siberia, Saxony, and Devonshire. A yelloio jasper is found at Vourla, bay of Smyrna, in a low ridge of limestone, to the right of the watering-place, between the harbor and the high hills back ; it is associated with opal, chryso prase, and hornstone, and these minerals seem to occupy in the limestone the place of hornstone, which is fiiund in various parts ofthe adjoining country, and also at Napoli di Romania in Greece. The plains of Argos are strewn with pebbles of red jasper. A variety of sandstone occurs in thin layers at Villa Rica, Brazil remarkable for its flexibility; a similar flexible sandstone occurs in the North Carolina gold region. In New York, quartz crystals are abundant in Herkimer Co., at Middleville, Little Falls, Salis bury, and Newport, loose in cavities in the Calciferous sand-rock, or imbedded in loose earth, and sometimes, according to Beck, in powdered anthracite. Fine dodecahedral crystals, at the beds prf specular iron in Fowler, Herman, and Edwards, St. Lawrence Co. In Gouverneur, crystals, with tourmaline, etc., in limestone, which have rounded angles as if they had been partially fused. Ou the banks of Laidlaw lake, Rossie, large implanted crystals. The Sterling ore bed, Antwerp, Jefferson Co., interesting dodecahedral crystals. 4 m. E. of Warwick, crystals presenting the p-homoohcdral form, in jasper. At Palatine, Montgomery Co., crystals, having one end terminates*"], [253, "QUARTZ, 197 with the usual pyramid, while the other is rounded and smooth. Diamond Rock, near Lansing burgh, an old but poor locality. At Ellenville lead mine, Ulster Co., in elegant groups. At Diamond island and Diamond Point, Lake George, quartz crystals, as in Herkimer Co. Iu Mass., crystals with unusual modifications, sparingly at tho Charlestown syenite quarry, 0110 of which from tht cabinet of Mr. J. E. Teschemacher i3 represented in f. 193. It has the adjacent planes 2-2 and 3-f uneven, and \u2014 -J with a triangular furrow but sharp edges ; the rest are lustrous ; with the re flective goniometer, reflecting the sun's rays, R A f-\u00a7 =175\u00b0. Pelham and Chesterfield, Mass., Paris and Perry, Me, Benton, N. H., Sharon, Vt., and Meadow Mount, Md., are other localities of quartz crystal. Near Quebec, fig. 191, and other crystals similar, but the inverse. At Chesterfield, Mass., Bmall unpolished rhombohedrons, in granite. At Paris, Me., handsome crystals of brown or smoky quartz. In large crystals, often perfect and weighing several pounds, at Minnesota mine, Lake Superior, occasionally enveloped in metallic copper, as if cast around the crystals. Drusy quartz, of brown, apple-green, and other tints, at Newfaue, Vt. For other localities, see the catalogue of localities in the latter part of this volume. Rose quartz, at Albany, and Paris, Me., Acworth, N. H., Williamsburg, Mass., Southbury, Conn., and Port Henry, Essex Co., N. Y. ; smoky quartz, at Goshen, Mass., Richmond Co., N. Y., etc. ; amethyst, in trap, at Keweenaw Point, Pic bay, and Gargontwa, on Lake Superior ; also in the same rock at Bristol, Rhode Island, and sparingly throughout the trap region of Massachusetts and Connecticut; in Surry, New Hampshire; in Pennsylvania, iu East Bradford, Aston, Chester, and Providence (one fine crystal over 7 lbs. in weight), in Chester Co. ; very handsome at the Prince vein, Lake Superior, but now hardly obtainable, as the mine is not worked ; also very large fine crystals, near Greensboro, N. C. Crystallized green quartz, in talc, at Providence, Delaware Co., Penn. ; at Ellenville, N. Y., with chlorite. Chalcedony and agates of moderate beauty, in the same trap region ; more abundantly about Lake Superior, the Mississippi, and the streams to the west ; at Natural Bridge, Jefferson Co., N. Y. ; about the Willamet, Columbia, and other rivers in Oregon; abundant and beautiful on N. W. shore of Lake Superior. Belmont's lead mine, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., has afforded good chalcedony and chrysoprase, associated with calcite. Red jasper is found on Sugar Loaf Mt., Maine ; in pebbles on the banks of the Hudson at Troy ; yellow, with chalcedony, at Chester, Mass. ; red and yellow, near Murphy's, Calaveras Co., Cal. Heliotrope occupies veins in slate at Bloomingrove, Orange Co., N. Y. Smoky quartz iu large crystals, some over 100 lbs., have been found on Paradise R., Nova Scotia. Quartz pseudomorphs, after hexagonal and scalenohedral crystals of calcite and cubes of fluorite, at Westhamptou, Mass. ; after barite, probably, in Rutherford Co., N. C, often filled with water. Quartz crystals occasionally occur of enormous size. A group in the museum of the university at Naples weighs nearly half a ton. A crystal belonging to Sig. Rafelli, of Milan, measures 34. ft. in length and 5jV in circumference, and its weight is estimated at 870 lbs; another in Paris is 3 ft. in diameter and weighs 8 cwt. About a century since a drusy cavity was opened at Zinken, which afforded 1,000 cwt. of rock crystal, and at that early period brought $300,000. One crystal weighed 800 lbs. A group from Moose Mountain, New Hampshire, at Dartmouth College, weighs 147,} lbs., and contaius 48 crystals ; four of them are from 5 to 5 J- inches in diameter, ten from 4 to 4J inches. A crystal from Waterbury, Vt., 2 ft. long and 13 inches through, weighs 175 lbs. Several varieties of this species have loug been employed in jewelry. Tho amethyst has always been esteemed for its beauty. Like most other stones, it is less brilliant by candle-light; it appears to best advantage when surrounded with pearls and set in gold. The color of the ame thyst is often irregularly diffused, as is well described by Pliny, \"ad viciuiam crystalli descendet albicante purpur\u00e6 defectu,\" purple, gradually fading into white. It was called amethyst, ufiiBmiro;, on account of its pretended preservative powers against intoxication, from pj, not, and pchu, tc intoxicate. This is not, however, the only amethyst of the ancients. The violet-colored sapphire, the violet fluorite (scalpturis faeiles, Plin., easily graven), and somo other purple species, were designated hy the same name ; and it has been supposed that garnet was also included. Cameos are in general made of onyx, which is well fitted for this kind of miniature sculpture. The most noted of the ancient cameos, is the Mantuan vase at Brunswick. It was cut from a single stone, and has the form of a cream pot, about seven inches high and two and a half broad ; on its outside, which is of a brown color, there are white and yellow groups of raised figures, representing Cere3 aud Triptolemus in search of Proserpine. The Museo Borbonico, at Naples, contains an onyx measuring eleven iuches by nine, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and another exhibiting the apotheosis of Ptolemy on one side and the head of Medusa on the other; both are splendid specimens of the art, and the former is supposed to be the largest in existence. The carnelian is often rich in color, but is too common to be much esteemed ; when first obtained from the rock they are usually gray or grayish-red ; they receive their fine colors from \u25a0in exposure of several weeks to the sun's rays, and a subsequent heating in earthen pots. Ths colors of agate, when indistinct, may be brought out by boiling in oil, and afterwaid in sidphurio acid ; tho latter carbonizes the oil absorbed by the porous layers, and thus increase s tho contrast"], [254, "198 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. os the different colors. Agate is often made into mortars for chemical and pharmaceutica. pro parations, and, according to Pliny, it was employed for the same purpose by the physicians of his day. Pliny also mentions that \"the best cautery for the human body is a ball of crystal acted on by the sun\" (xxxvii. 10). He deplores the extravagance of his times, as exhibited in the crystal drinking cups and vases of the wealthy. Jasper admits of a brilliant polish, and is often formed into vases, boxes, knife-handles, etc. It is also extensively used in the manufacture of Florentine mosaics. Quartz is distinguished by its hardness\u2014 scratching glass with facility; infusibility\u2014 not fusing before the blowpipe ; insolubility \u2014 not attacked by water or the acids ; undeavability \u2014 one variety being tabular, but proper cleavage never being distinctly observed. To these characteristics tho action of soda B.B. may be added. The word quartz is of German provincial origin. Agate is from the name of the river Achates, in Sicily, wheuce specimens were brought, as stated by Theophrastus.

Opal often contains more or less of quartz mixed with it; aud most of the analyses are unsatisfactory, because they leave the amount of the latter wholly unconsidered ; and since solubility in a hot solution of caustic potash is not a decisive test of opal, as shown by Rammelsberg (Pogg., cxii. 177), no method for its exact determination is known.

The last mentioned is the probable source of tho opal of limestones and argillaceous beds (as it is of flint in the same rocks), and of part of that in igneous rocks. It exists in most chalcedony and flint. Being like quartz in origin, it is natural that the two should be often mixed together. Common opal and hyalite are products of the decomposition of a Roman cement at the hot springs of Plombieres in France. Precious opal occurs in porphyry at Czerwenitza, near Kashau in Hungary, at Frankfort, and at Gracias a Dios in Honduras. Fire opal occurs at Zimapan in Mexico ; Faroe ; near San Antonio, Honduras. Common opal is abundant at Telkebanya in Hungary; near Pernstein, Luckau, and Smrezet in Moravia ; in Bohemia ; at Kosemiltz in Silesia ; fiubertsburg in Saxony ; Stanzel- berg and Quegstein in Siebengebirge ; Steinheim near Hanau; in Faroe, Iceland; the Giant's Causeway, and the Hebrides ; also within -J- m. and to the S.W. of the watering-place at Vourla, the harbor of Smyrna, along with yellow jasper and hornstone, imbedded in a low ridge of yel- lowish compact limestone ; of a wax-ye!low and grayish-green color, occasionally white, at the Giant's Causeway. Hyalite occurs in amygdaloid at Schemnitz, Hungary; in clinkstone at Waltseh, Bohemia. Wood opal forms large trees in the pumice conglomerates of Saiba, near Neu- sohl ; Kremnitz, Hungary ; Faroe ; near Hobart Town, Tasmania ; and in many other regions of igneous rocks. The Luneberg earth contains many species of infusoria, and is 10 to 18 ft. thick. In U. S , hyalite occurs sparingly in N. York, at the Phillips ore bed, Putnam Co., in thin coat- ings on granite ; rarely in N. C, Cabarrus Co., with the auriferous quartz ; in Georgia, in Burke and Scriven Cos., lining cavities in a siliceous shell-rock ; in Washington Co., good fire opal ; at the Suanna spring, Florida, small quantities of siliceous sinter. The pi ecious opal, when large, and exhibiting its peculiar play of colors in perfection, is a gem of high value. It is cut with a convex surface. 233. Jenzschite. \u2014 A second modification of amorphous silica is mentioned above (p. 194) as announced by G. Jenzsch. The facts may receive other explanation. For the present the opals supposed to represent it may be included under the above name. The characteristic is a specific gravity of 2-6, like quartz-silica, while soluble in a hot solution of caustic potash. The kinds here referred to are a white cacholong from Hiittenberg in Carinthia, G. = 2-591 ; from Hutberg, near Weissig, in amygdaloid, G.=2-633\u2014 2-647 ; from the porphyry of Regensberg, G. = 2620; from Brazil, G =2-596. The;- are generally associated with chalcedony, and Jenzsch regards them as a result of its alteration!"], [258, "202 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. II. TERNARY OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 1. SILICATES. A. ANHYDEOUS SILICATES. Tlie following are the general subdivisions of the Anhydrous Silicates : I. Bisilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : 2. II. Unisilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : 1 III. Subsilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : less than 1 ; mostly 1 : f- ; but also 1 : \\, and 1 : \\. These subdivisions are essentially the same that were brought forward in the last edition of this work. The section of Tersilicates has, however, disappeared, the species hitherto arranged under that head being proved to have no existence^ and the few Sesquisilicates, and the Micas and Feld spars, are added to the Unisilicates. Constitution and Formulas of Silicates.\u2014 The bases in the Silicates comprise various elements of Series I. (see p. 2) in their different states of oxydation, protoxyd, sesquioxyd, or deutoxyd, and possibly tritoxyd; namely, K, Na, Li, Th, Cs, H, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Ce, La, Di, Fe, Mn, Cr, Al, and rarely also Zn, Ni, Co, Ti ; aud in a few cases boron, of Series II., in the tritoxyd state. The ele ment silicon is so strongly negative, that in its oxygen combinations all other elements present are relatively basic. The basic elements enumerated, when in the same state of oxydation, are mutually replaceable; and, as the analyses beyond illustrate, 8 or 10 often occur in the same compound, combined either in simple, or indeterminate, ratios. But while in general thus replacing one another, there are certain groups, as, for example, the Feldspar and Scapolite, in which Al is not replaced by fe, nor Ca, Na, K by Mg, or Fe, tbe presence of the latter ingrepdients being an irregularity, and proof of mixture or alteration. The basic elements are also mutually replaceable when in different states of oxydation, under the law that parts equal in power of combiuation with oxygen are equivalent or isomorphous , that is, the replacing power equals the combining power. Thus 3 R 0 (=R3 O3), R\" 0s, \u00a7 R 0s (\u2022***\u25a0\u25a0 RJ 03). J R- O3, R 03 are replaceable ; and so also are Rs 0s (=2 R 0), and R 0s ; for the basic metal is combined with an equal amount of oxygen, 3 atoms in the former group, and 2 in the latter. The basic metals of these different oxyds by themselves represent so many different states cor responding to the states of oxydation, and are therefore equivalents in combination. The above formulas, if divided by 3, become reduced to the protoxyd form R 0, R 5 0, B,i 0, Rs 0, Rs 0, and the expressions for the different states of the basic metals, to R, Ra, R* Rs, R*V. The first three of these states have been denominated in a note to page 2, and in the Introduction, p. xv, the alpha, beta, and gamma states ; the expressions are correspondingly written nR, /?R, rR, <R, rR. aRO equals R 0, or a protoxyd. So also /SR 0=\u00a3(RS O3), or a third of a sesquioxyd; rR0= i (R 0s), or half of a deutoxyd ; and tR 0=\u00a3 (R O3), or one-third of a tritoxyd. aR, /3R, rR, iSR, cR, are mutually replaceable, or equivalent in substitutions. The Bisilicates come under a single general formula, which may either have tho form A, cr thai ofB. The a is here dropped, it being unnecessary. A. (R\u00ab fi, K I, fi) \u00a7i' B.

In the new system of chemistry the formulas of the Bisilicates and Unisilicates, in their most general form, are written in the following manner, essentially, by writers on tho subject, except that the letter R is here used with the Greek letters to express the metal in the different states of oxydation : * Bisilicates Si \u00a9 ) R2, B, PS, yB f ** Unisilicates Si ) \u201e4 E2, S, PB, yB f *** These formulas may be more conveniently written in a single line, as follows ; and to facilitate a comparison, the formulas of the older system are here added : Old system. Old system modified. New system. Bisilicates (ft3, fi) Si3 (RO, PB 0) Si Unisilicates (ft3, fi)2 Si3 (RO,.tfRO)2 Si Si *e|e2||(R, R, PR) Sil|e4||(R2,R, PB). By means of fractions prefixed to the Rs or Rs, the ratios of tho constituents may be expressed, as in the older formulas. The Subsilicates vary iu formula according to the' varying ratios, as presented beyond (p. 362) The only silicates having the basic metals in the sesquioxyd state alone occur among the jSubsili cates. Besides the silicates that are obviously Bisilicates and Unisilicates, there are others whicli, while bisilicate or unisilicate in type, contain a surplus of silica in serial ratios. The Feldspar group is remarkable for its unity in crystallographic and all physical characters, evincing the profoundest isotypism ; and yet the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica varies from 1 : 1 to 1 : 3. The fact that all the essential characters of a Feldspar appear in their perfection under the unisilicate ratio shows that the amount of silica of a Unisilicate is all that is required to make a Feldspar, aud hence that the type is strictly unisilicate ; and further, that the excess of silica must exist in the species in some state consistent with conformity to the unisilicate type. The amount of silica in the species of the Feldspar group increases with the increasing proportion of alkali in the mineral, from anorthite, a Unisilicate without, usually, any alkali, to albite and ortho clase, literal Trisilicales, with the protoxyd bases solely alkaline. The Micas vary in the same way, being unisilicate strictly in the species containing the least alkali, and having a higher proportion as the alkali increases, and the highest in the lithia mica3, in one of which the ratio is 1 : 2. The Meionite section of the Scapolite group is in meionite strictly unisilicate, without J \u00bb:. pp, while mizzonite has much alkali and more sihea in proportion than meionite, and maria. us (which like mizzonite is hardly distinguishable from meionite in crystallo graphic or physical * . -act ts) is bisilicate, with the alkali constituting much the larger part of tho protoxyd bases. Th -.'.'.polite section of the Scapolite group illustrates the same point. The special ratios for this and each of the preceding groups are stated iu the general remarks preceding the section on tho Unisilicates. Among Bisilicates, spodumene is closely related to the Pyroxene group in crystallization and other characters, including the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica, although alumina and lithia are prominent constituents. Pelattte has the same crystallization (as shown by Descloizeaux) and the same constituents as spodumene, and therefore is also pyroxene-like in its fundamental char acteristics ; and yet it contains twice the proportion of silica, the oxygen ratio for ft, fi, Si in * R2 stands for 2 of a monad element, as potassium, sodium, lithium, thallium, c\u00e6sium, rubi dium, hydrogen, and R for other basic elements, as already exnlained. See also .Am. J. Sci., IL div 252, 261, and Inlrod., p. xv."], [260, "204 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. spodumene being 1:4:10, and in petalite 1 : 4: 20, a contrast of great interest in this connect on, as remarked by Descloizeaux. The amount of silica in spodumene shows what is essential to tho type, and therefore proves that both are essentially Bisilicates. It differs from petalite in thai tho. protoxyd bases include a little lime and protoxyd of iron (about one-twelfth of all the protoxyds, from the average of the best analyses, those of Rammelsberg, Hagen, and Smith & Brush), while in petalite they are purely alkaline.* The Feldspars, Micas, and the Meionite and Scapolite groups are examples of a surplus of silica in species under the unisilicate type, and the Spodumene group under the bisilicate. In each the alkali present appears to be the determinative cause. The surplus silica above what the type requires may have one of the two following conditions : Either it may be (1 ) part basic (half of it under the unisilicate type, and one-third of it under the bisilicate type) ; or it may be (2) allacces sory silica. The formula of albite, under the unisilicate type, to which it is shown above to be long, would be as follows, according to these two methods : lstmethod ft Na3 + f\u00a3l+| Si*)2Si3, or Si|104|(i Na2+f/JA:l + 2d method ftNa3+|Sl)2 Si3+3 Si, or Sije.JKi Na,+ J/3Al) + SiO)s For other examples see the formulas of the Unisilicates beyond (p. From the facts here explained it follows that the Mica and Feldspar groups should be annexed entire to the section of Unisilicates ; and petalite to the section of Bisilicates. The intermediate silicates are thus mostly disposed of without the provision of other sections. Iolite has the 0 ratio for bases and silica of muscovite (or 1 : 14J, and its excess of silica above that of the Unisil icates may be of the same nature as in that species. Tbe case of nephelite may be similar. The hydrous species of silicates are here separated from the anhydrous, as in other divisions in the classification, because the course seems most convenient in the present imperfect state of chemical science. There is no criterion yet furnished for deciding upon the state of the water present, whether part, or all, or none, is basic; and until chemists have some means of reaching safe conclusions on this point, the true relations of the hydrous and anhydrous species cannot to any great extent be positively made out. Moreover there is often doubt as to whether the water present is simply hygrometric and accidental; or whether it exists as a result of incipient or ad vanced alteration of the mineral ; or whether it belonged to the species from its origin ; and these doubts still further complicate the subject. In some silicates, as euclase for example, th3 water appears to be so plainly basic that the species have been arranged beyond with the anhydrous ; and this is the beginning of a final disregard of the distinction which will probably before long be warranted. In the descriptions of the silicates beyond, the chemical formulas given are those of the old system, as these are equally intelligible to all chemists. But in the tables preceding the general divisions ofthe species, the new formulas are introduced as well as the old. Note on the History of the Silicates. In the work of the Swedish mineralogist Wallerius, of 1747, silicates as such are unrecognized, and the only species of those now so called which are described, are the gems that passed under the names of emerald, beryl, topaz, hyacinth, chrysolite, garnet; clays of various kinds aud names ; mica, talc, serpentine, amianthus, asbestus, feldspar, and the convenient pocket for various undetermined heavy stones, named Corneus \u2014 the Hornbdrg of the Swedish mineralogist, and Roche de Come of his French translator, and which embraced Skiurl ( Schorl of the Germans) as a prominent part of it. Quartz (Kieselsten, or Silex) in its many varieties, with opal, made up a large part ofthe non-metallic division of the science, occupying 30 pages out of 200. Feldspar is placed in the genus Spatum, as Spatum pyrimachum (or scintillating spar) along side of fluor, Iceland spar, and heavy spar ; and sapphire and the other precious stones are in the group of Gems. All of these species excepting feldspar had special names in Pliny's time; and feldspar is distinctly referred to in Agricola as \" Silex ex eo ictu ferri facile ignis elicitur, in cubis aliisque figuris intersectis constans\" (p. 314, 1546). _ Cronstedt's work of 1758 includes with the preceding the species Zeolite, a receut discovery of his own (1756); but adds no others. He shows however his acumen in making his group of Kiesel-Arler (siliceous minerals) to include uot only the varieties of quartz, but also feldspar and the gems above enumerated (and his adding to it the diamond is not surprising). Garnet and schorl are left outside, and make the two species of his Granat-Arter ; Mica (Glimmer- Arter) and Asbestus (Asbest-Arter), with Ler-Arter (clay minerals), are the other independent groups. Transparent tourmalines from Ceylon were among the gems of the day, having been first iutro. duced into Europe in 1707 or before, but they are not distinctly mentioned by Cronstedt or WaV ,erius. * See further on this subject a paper by the author in Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 398, 18b7."], [261, "205 8ILICATES. The group of Schorl increased in it***, varieties for the next twenty-five years, and after that becami> prolific in species, and much of the history of mineralogy is involved in its various phases. Tht following observations make, therefore, an introduction to the synonymy of many minerals beyond. The Corneus, or Hornbdrg, of Wallerius included a variety of hard, cheap or w-orthless stones, rather heavy, mostly of dark colors from black to dull green. The name alludes to a resemblance to horn in the aspect of some of the kinds. To Corneus solidus belonged the massive, compact, flinty rocks of black and lighter shades ; also petrosilex (or Halleflinia of the Swedes, which means false flint) of different shades; and massive hornblende (\"granulis compactis\"), though the name hornblende was, by a mistake of its German use, given by Wallerius to a black zinc-blende alone. His Corneus sissilis embraced lamellar forms of hornblende and pyroxene, and some slaty rocks. White Corneus crysiallisalus was his Skiorl, which comprised opaque tourmalines, and other prismatic minerals of black, brown, green, and reddish colors, as hornblende, actinolite, ani*7 perhaps pyroxene, and at the head of the list basalt, and basanite or Lydian stone. Cronstedt's Skorl made up his genus Basaltes, and was nearly synonymous with tho Corneus crystallizalus of Wallerius. Its varieties were better defined ; and to massive, lamellar, and colum nar hornblende, actinolite and pyroxene and crystallized opaque tourmaline were added ; and in an appendix to the species, cruciform staurotide. The name Hornblende is applied only to the mas sive variety or rock which Cronstedt made a bole, and called Bolus induratis particu'lis squamosis; it probably covered other similar stones. J. Hill in his work on Fossils, published in London, and according to the title page in 1771 (though de Lisle says it was not issued until 1772), says of the \"SCrls,\" that \"as to size we see them from that of barley corn up to the Giant's Causeway,\" and the columns of the latter he calls \"Irish Shirl,\" or \"Basaltes Hibernicus.\" The group contains also macle or chiastolite from Andalusia, besides tourmaline, etc. In the editions of Wallerius of 1772 and 1778 there is a little advance beyond the first as re gards the number and classification of the species. Cronstedt is followed in the position of feld spar, and in the name \"Basaltes\" for the schorls; and Corneus is restricted to massive, fibrous, and coarse columnar stones, among which stands \"hornblende\" as Corneus spathosus, and \" trapp \" as Corneus trapezius. At this period de Lisle brought crystallography to bear on the subject. But while making known new distinctions, he did not appreciate their full value, or tho precision required for thorough work. As a consequence, the group of Schorls (or Schorls, as he writes the word) in his later treatise of 1783, reached its greatest extension, although in a partly divided state. He early pronounced basaltic columns no crystals, and dropped off this excrescence. He showed in 1772 that the gem tourmaline, his Transparent rhomboidal schorl, was identical in form with the common black schorl. But still he made the latter a distinct species, his Opaque rlwmboidal schorl, and included in it, along with black or opaque tourmaline, crystals of hornblende, augite, octahe drite from Oisans, rutile (needles in quartz), and, as a white variety, thin twins of albite, whose relation to feldspar he did not perceive ; and even hexagonal nephelite from Vesuvius has a passing remark under this head. Axinite, then a novelty from Dauphiny, was made a short lenticular variety of Transparent rlwmboidal schorl, or tourmaline, its rhomboidal planes proving to his eye the relationship. The massive mineral called Hornblende, or Roche de Come, referred by Cronstedt to Bole, he annexes to Schorl as a massive or semicrystallized kind, but makes it a separate species, Schorl o.rgileux, although apparently appreciating that it was little entitled to the distinction. Schorl crueiforme was his last species in the group, and to it were referred both andalusite and staurolite \u2014 the latter his Pierre de croix, with the prismatic angle of 130\u00b0 by his measurement; and the former, Macle basaltique, with an angle of 95\u00b0. The garnets and schorls were placed iu a common division, as done by Cronstedt, and garnet was made the first species, with tourmaline the second, and \"cruciform schorl\" the fifth. Garnet included the \"white garnet,\" as it was called, of Vesuvius (leucite), first observed by Ferber in 1772. Besides these Silicates, de Lisle's work has its several groups of Gems, Feldspar, Argillaceous Minerals (em bracing mica, asbestus, talc, serpentine), Zeolite, aud Quartz. Labradorite, from Labrador (first brought to Europe about 1770), stands as a variety of feldspar, to which it had been referred by Werner; idocrase, of which many figures are given by him (first described and figured by Cappeler in 1722). meionite (hyacintes blanches), from Somma, and harmotome from Andreas berg (his hyacinie blanche crueiforme, made calcareous spar by V. Born in 17 75, who first mentions and figures it, but a hyacinth-like siliceous species by Bergmann in 1780), are placed with zircon as kinds of hyacinth. After de Lisle, as chemistry and crystallography made progress, the disintegration of the great Schorl group went rapidly forward, until the only thing left to it was common tourmaline ; and now the name, once so important, has become a mere mineralogical relic. In Werner's system of 1789. as published by Hoffmann (Bergm. J., i. 369, 1789), Schorl includes only tho species Tourmaline as it now stands. The Kieselarlen, or Siliceous species (commencing with the diamond still), comprised the different gems ; among which st*inds chrysoberyl (the modern), and, as distinct"], [262, "206 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. species, axinite, prehnite, hornblende of various kinds, with feldspar, mica, chlorite, the claya etc. ; while under Talkarten, or Magnesian species, there are kyanite, actinolite, with asbestus talc, serpentine, nephrite, etc. Silica was first proved to be a chemical constituent of many mineral species by Bergmann; and in his Opuscula (1780) and his Sciagraphia Regni Mineralis (1782) he distinguishes, after analyses by himself (made by fusion with potash, a method of his own), the following minerals as siliceous compounds of alumina, with or without lime or magnesia, namely, topaz, emerald, garnet, schorl (black tourmaline), hornblende, mica, zeolite from Iceland, feldspar, and the clays ; and as essen- tially magnesian silicates, containing lime and a little iron, and little or no alumina, actinolite, asbestus (mountain cork and mountain leather), amianthus, steatite. These were the investiga- tions that commenced the disbanding of the schorls, and before Werner's system of 1 789 was published, mauy other analyses, more or less imperfect, had already been made by Wiegleb, Klaproth, Achard, Heyer, Mayer, Hopfner, Pelletier, and other chemists of the day. The word Schorl of the Germans has been supposed to be derived from the name of a locality of the mineral, Schorlau (meaning Schorl-village) in Germany. But Prof. Naumann says (in 3 recent letter to the author) that it is more likely that the name is a miner's term of unknown origin, and that the village got its name from tbe occurrence there of the schorl. Some German mineralogists have pronounced it of Swedish origin, and as first used by Cronstedt. But il occurs in Briickmann's Magnaha Dei, published at Braunschweig in 1727, on page 175, where it is spelt schirl. It exists also still earlier, as the author has found, in Ercker's Aula Subterranea, first published in 1595, shurl and wolfram being spoken of as among the rejected materia] in auriferous washings; and again in the yet older work of Gesner, De Rerum Foss, etc., 1565, p. 87, where schurl (misspelt 1 schrul) is given as the German for \" Lapilli nigri steriles \" of a tin vein, which, \"quando cum lapillis plumbi candidi [or tin] coquuntur plumbum consumunt,\" etc.; again, in Matthesius's Sarepta, 1562, in the 9th \"Predigt,\" where \"Schurl\" is quite fully described, and also, in the next paragraph, \"Wolffrumb.\" The name Schorl (or Schurl) was at that time used quite indefinitely for the sterile (or metallurgically worthless) black little stones (\"nigri lapilli \") accompanying tin ore and gold, especially the former ; and, as they were among the refuse of the ore-washings, Adelung suggests that Schorl may have come from the old Ger- man word Schor, meaning impurities, or refuse. General Pyrognostic Characters of the Silicates. In the systematic pyrognostic examination of silicates, the following points should bo particularly noticed : 1. If in the closed lube the substance prove hydrous, the water given out should be tested as ,to whether it is acid or alkaline. If acid, this may bo evidence that the mineral contains fluorine; and if alkaline, that possibly the substance is an altered mineral. In the former case, the water should be (a) tested with Brazil-wood paper; (b) the tube should be carefully observed, to ascer- tain whether it has been dimmed or etched by the action of the fluorine ; and, further (c), the test for fluorine, by fusing in the open tube with salt of phosphorus, should be employed. 2. In the examination B.B. on charcoal it should be noted that silicates containing much iron become magnetic; and silicates ofthe oxyds of iron, copper, etc., yield metallic buttons on fusion with soda. 3. In examining the mineral in the platinum-pointed forceps, it should always be treated in O.F to ascertain (a) whether it imparts a color to the flame ; and (6) its fusibility, remembering that some silicates, infusible in O.F., become fusible by a reduction of their bases to a lower state of oxydation in R.F. It is to be noted that (c) only infusible and light-colored silicates can be tested for alumina B.B. with cobalt solution, since all fusible silicates, not containing metallic oxyds, give a cobalt-blue glass ; (d) a small amount of soda in a silicate may, by the intense yellow color it imparts to the flame, mask a much larger percentage of potash or other alkali, as in the case of some varieties of potash-feldspar (orthoclase) ; (e) when silicates, like hornblende, pyroxene, or garnet, contain various isomorphous bases, the fusibility of the species has a wide range; in garnet, for example, it varying from the easy fusibility of almandine to the infusibility of ouvaro vite ; (/) a few silicates react alkaline after ignition or fusion. 4. In treatment with the fluxes, it is to be noted (a) that most silicates are dissolved in soda with effervescence, (b) If sulphur or sulphuric acid is present, the mineral gives in R.F. a sulphii] which reacts for sulphur when moistened and placed on a surface of silver, (c) Borax dissolves silicates ; and if they contain metallic oxyds, the nature of these oxyds may be determined by treatment in O.F. and R.F. (d) Salt of phosphorus decomposes almost all silicates, dissolving the bases, and leaving a gelatinous skeleton of insoluble silica ; and if metallic oxyds are prenent, thej m\\y also impart a characteristic color to the bead in O.F. and R.F."], [263, "3I8ILICATE8. 207 I.

The. bronzite also of Lettowitz and Goldenstein in Moravia, of Aipstem near Sontra in Hesse, of Cape Lizard in Cornwall, may belong here according to Des cloizeaux ; but their chemical and optical characters are not yet ascertained. The brown pyrox ene-like mineral which is a prominent constituent of the rock called Lherzolite, from the depart ment of Arriege, France, is referred here by Descloizeaux. The bronzite of Leiperville afforded Descloizeaux prisms of 87\u00b0 and 93\u00b0; and that of Texas, half a mile W. of the village, occurs in large foliated and fibrous masses ; neither is submetallic in lustre. Descloizeaux first defined the limits of this species, as here laid down. Named from Wrpii-np*, an opponent, because so refractory. Thc name bronzite has priority, but a bronze lustre is not essential, and is far from universal. Shepard's chladnite was so imper feetly and incorrectly described that the name cannot claim precedence ; he made it a tersilicate of magnesia (1. a). Alt. \u2014 Bastile or Schiller spar, the original from Baste iu the Harz, is regarded by Streng as altered protobastite or bronzite. G.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Bisilicate of different protoxyd bases, under the general formula E Si ; these bases (B) being lime (Ca), magnesia (Mg), protoxyd of iron (Fe), protoxyd of manganese (Jin), and sometimes potash (K), soda (Na), and oxyd of zinc (Zn). Usually two or more of these bases are present. The first three, lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of iron, are most common ; but lime is the only one that is present always and in large percentage. Besides the substitutions of different protoxyd bases for one another, these same bases are at times replaced by sesquioxyd bases (Si, 3?e, Sn), though sparingly; and the silica occasionally by alumina. The species has therefore the general formula (B3, S) (Si, Si*)3, which may also be written (B, B*) (Si, Sl}). The varieties proceeding from these isomorphous substitutions are many and diverse ; andtheru are still others depending on the state of crystallization. The foliated and fibrous kinds early received separate names, and for a while were regarded as distinct species. Fibrous or columnar forms are very much less common than in hornblende, and lamellar or foliated kinds more com mon. The crystals are rarely long and slender, or bladed, like those of that species. The name Pyroxene is from irSp, fire, and fwos, stranger, and records Haiiy's idea that the mine ral was, as he expresses it, \"a stranger in the domain of fire,\" whereas, in fact, it is, next to the feldspars, the most universal constituent of igneous rocks. This error, however, was more than counterbalanced by Haiiy's discovery of the true crystallographic distinction of the species, which led him to bring together, under this one name, what Werner and others had regarded as distinct species. The name, therefore, is properly the name of the species, while Augite is only entitled to be used for one of its varieties. The most prominent division of the species is into (A) the non-aluminous; (B) the aluminous. But the former of these groups shades imperceptibly into the latter. These two groups are generally subdivided according to the prevalence of the magnesia, lime, protoxyd of iron, or protoxyd of manganese, or of two or three together of these protoxyd bases. Yet here, also, the gradation from one series to another is in general by almost insensible shade:! as to composition and chemical characters, as well as all physical qualities. I.

ProiheUe is sombre-green, in crystals, and approaches fassaite ; from Zillerthal in the Tyrol. d. Funkiie_ is dark olive-green coccolite from Boksiiter in Gothland, having a larger percentage of Fe than Mg. It may be convenient to use this name for the pyroxene here included that con tains 10 p. c. or more of protoxyd of iron. e. Diallage. (Diallage pt. H., Tr., 89, 1S01. Hypersthene pt. Bronzite pt.) Part of the so-called diallage, or thin-foliated pyroxene, belongs here, and the rest under the corresponding division ofthe aluminous pyroxenes. Color grayish-green to bright grass-green, and deep green ; lustre of cleavage surface pearly, sometimes metalloidal or brassy; H.=4; G.=3*2\u2014 3'35. Double refraction strong; bisectrix negative ; inclined about 38\u00b0 to a normal to i-i, and showing therefore, when viewed through i-i, a single system of rings in the field of the polarizing instrument (Descl.); the angle 35\" to 40\u00b0, observed in the air (24\u00b0 \u2014 26\u00b0 in oil) in the diallage of Knockdallian in Scotland, of Zobtenberg and Baumgarten in Silesia; a grayish hypersthene-like mineral in large folia in the gabbro of tho Ruben coal mine near Neurode ; the vanadiferous bronzite of Genoa. But the green diallage of Neurode, analyzed by v. \"Rath (No. 4, p. 219), has this angle about 49\u00b0 50' ; and so also that of Bormio in Veltliu ; diverging thus from ordinary diallage and diopside. With this variety belongs part also of what has been called hypersthene and bronzite \u2014 the part that is easily fusible. Common especially in serpentine rocks. Named from <ip.piAA.iyi*, difference, in allusion to the dissimilar cleavages. The grass-green diallage-liko mineral smaragdiie, constituting, with saussurite, a rock, is in part, at least, amphibole (q. v). 3. Iron-Lime Pyroxene; HedEj\\tbergite. (Hedenbergite (fr.

Anal, correspond to (+ Oa+i Fe) Si. Named after the Swedish chemist, Ludwig Hedenberg, who first analyzed and described the mineral. Lotalite, from Lotala in Fin land, is in black lamellar masses. Beudant gives for the angles of hedenbergite O a 7=100' 10' \u201412', I A 1=87\" 15' ; and Breithaupt for the Taberg mineral (Pyroxenus diagonalis Breith.) I A I =87\u00b0 28', C=73\u00b0 51'. 4. Lime-Magnesia-Manganese Pyroxene; Schefferite (Schefferit J. A. Michaelson, J. pr. Ch., xc. 170). Color reddish-brown. G.=3*39. Contains lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of manganese, and in the absence of zinc differs from jeffersonite. Formula (Ca, Mg, Mn) Si; from Longban. The Richterite of Breith. (B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 364, 1865) is near schefferite in composition. It occurs in acicular crystals, having I A 7=133\u00b0 38', which appears to be the angle / A i-i of pyroxene ( = 133\u00b0 33'), with G. = 2-826; color isabella-ycllow, rarely pale yellow-ish-brown, and is easily fusible. If the prismatic angle is I A i-i of pyroxene, the mineral belongs here. But Igelstrom finds a very similar mineral in aspect and composition at Paisberg, with I A 7=124\u00b0 ; and the analyses are given under amphibole (see p. 234). 5. Lime-Iron-JIanganese Pyroxene. A variety from L. Laach, analyzed by Bischof, is here included. 6. Lime-Iron-Manganese-Zinc Pyroxene; Jefferson-tie (Keating & Vanuxem, J. Ac. Philad., ii. 194, 1822). Color greenish-black.

Named from the locality at Fassa in the Tyrol, which affords deep-green crystals, sometimes pistachio-green, like the epidote of the locality. Pyrgom was so named from nipyoi/Aa, a tower. b. Augite. Includes the greenish or brownish-black and black kinds, occurring mostly in eruptive rocks, but also iu metamorphic. Named from dvyri, lustre. The Augite of Werner (and Volcanite Delameth.) included only the black mineral of igneous rocks \u2014 the volcanic schorl of earlier authors. c. Aluminous Diallage. 9. Aluminous Iron-Lime Pyroxene; Hudsonite (Beck, Min. N. T., 405, 1842). Lamellar or cleav able massive. Color black. Streak green. Often has a bronze tarnish. G.=3-5, Beck; 3*43 \u2014 3-46, Brewer. Contains lime and protoxyd of iron, with but little magnesia; formula (Ca, Fe) (Si, Si*). Named from the Hudson river, in the vicinity of which it occurs, in Cornwall, Orange Co., N. T. b. Polylite of Thomson (Min., i. 495, 1 836) may be the same compound. It is described as cleavable massive ; G. = 3-231 ; H. = 6 \u2014 6*5; color black; opaque; and is stated to come from a bed of magnetic iron ore at Hoboken, N. J., where no such bed of ore exists. Appendix. \u2014 10. Asbestus. Asbestus is a finely fibrous variety, with the fibres easily separable and usually flexible. But most asbestus belongs to the species hornblende, which tends more to run into fibrous forms. It is difficult to distinguish the hornblende asbestus from the pyroxene, except by noting its issociation with known varieties of one or the other species ; and this method is not free from loubt. See further under Hornblende for description, analyses, and localities of asbestus. 11. Breislakite (Brocchi, Cat. di uua raccolta di Rocce, 28, 60, 70, 192, 1817 ; Cyclopeite, in Descl. Min., 65, 1862). Occurs in wool-like forms at Vesuvius and Capo-di-Bove. Its crystal lographic identity with pyroxene has been shown by Chapman (Phil. Mag., xxxvii. 444, 1850). The particular variety of pyroxene to which it belongs has not been ascertained, as no analysis of it has been made. Named aster Breislak, an Italian geologist. 12. Lavroffile (Lawrowit, Vanadin-Augit, Kokscharof, Bull. Ac. St. Pet., xi. 78, 1866) is an alumina pyroxene, colored green by vanadium, from the river Sludianka, beyond Lake Baikal, ivhere it occurs coarse granular massive with quartz, and also in small imperfect crystals. Cleavage affords the prism 87\u00b0 7' ; and there is the usual lamination, from compound structure parallel to 0. The color is fine emerald-green. It contains besides silica some alumina, iron, lime, magnesia, and a trace of manganese and vanadium ; but no analysis has been made, so that its exact place among the pyroxenes is not certain. I.

Varieties rich in iron afford a magnetic globule when fused on charcoal, and in general their fusibility varies with the amount of iron. Jeffersonito gives with soda on charcoal a reaction for zinc and manganese ; many others also givo with the fluxes reactions for manganese. Most vari eties are unacted upon by acids. Obs. \u2014 Pyroxene is a common mineral in crystalline limestone and dolomite, in serpentine, anil in volcanic rocks ; and occurs also, but less abundantly, in connection with granitic rocks and metamorphic schists. The pyroxene of limestone is mostly the white and light green, or gray varieties ; that of most other metamorphic rocks, sometimes white or colorless, but usually green of different shades, from pale green to greenish-black, and occasionally black ; that of serpentine is sometimes in fine crystals, but often of the foliated green kind called diallage ; that of eruption \"ocks is tl e black to greenish-black augite."], [276, "220 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. In limestone the associates are often hornblende, scapolite, garnet, orthoclase, sphci.e. phlogo pite, and sometimes brown tourmaline, chlorite, talc, zircon, spinel, rutile, etc.; and in otber metamorphic, rocks mostly the same. In eruptive rocks the crystals are imbedded, and often occiu with similarly disseminated chrysolite, crystals of orthoclase, sanidin, labradorite, leucite, etc. Pyroxene is an essential constituent of many rocks. Pyroxenyte is a metamorphic rock consist ing mainly of compact pyroxene of the Sahlite section. Lherzolyte, from the borders of Lake Lherz, in the department of Ariege in France (described by Charpentier and Dufrenoy as a variety of pyroxene), is a green pyroxenic rock. (For constitution, see under Spinel.) Pyroxene along with labradorite constitutes the dark gray and green to black eruptive rock called doleryte, which often contains also magnetic iron ore in grains ; aud with labradorite and chrysolite, the related rock basalt. Doleriiic and basaltic lavas have the same composition. With leucite it forms the leucitophyr, the common igneous rock of Vesuvius ; and with nephelin, nephelinyte or nephelin doleryte, another Italian igneous rock. The pyroxene of these igneous rocks is the black variety augite ; aud it often occurs in distinct crystals of the forms iu figs. 203-206. Many kinds of tufa, and the earthy basaltic rock called wacke (either a variety of tufa or a decomposed basalt or doleryte) often consist largely of crystals or grains of augite. Diallage occurs generally in serpentine or steatitic rocks. Many foreign localities of pyroxene have already been briefly indicated (pp. 214-219). The crystals of Ala in Piedmont are associated with garnets and talc in veins traversing serpentine; and the more transparent are sometimes cut and worn as gems. In N. America, it occurs in Maine, at Raymond and Rumford, diopside, sahlite, etc. ; at Deer Isle, diallage in serpentine. In Vermont, at Thetford, black augite, with chrysolite, in boulder3 of basalt. In Mass., in Berkshire, white crystals abundant; at the Bolton quarries, same, good; Westfield aud Blanford, diallage in serp. In Conn., at Canaan, white cryst. 2-3 in. long by L-2 in. broad, in dolomite ; in Trumbull, large green cryst. in limestone ; in Reading, on the turnpike near thc line of Danbur}-, small transp. cryst., and granular ; at Watertown, near the Naugatuck, white diopside.

In Delaware, at Wilmington, a liypersthene-like variety (anal. 21), Nuttal's Maclareite. In Canada, at Bytown, subtrp. white cryst., 1-14 in., in limestone; at Calumet I., grayish-green cryst. in limestone with phlogopite, some appearing to be altered Eozoon; at the High Falls of the Madawaska, cryst. sometimes 1 ft. long and 4 in. wide, having cryst. cf hornblende attached; in Kildau, as a rock ; in Bathurst, colorless or white cryst. ; near Ottawa, in large subtrp. cryst., in limestone ; at Grenville, dark green cryst., and granular ; at Montreal, Rougemont and Montarvelli Mts., black iu doleryte. Alt. \u2014 Pyroxene undergoes alteration in different ways, as has been well explained byBischof, aud many species have been instituted on the material in different stages of change. In the simplest, there is only a taking up of water, producing a \" hydrous augite.\" The water found in several of the analyses already cited may be from this source. In many cases a loss of silica appears to attend this hydration ; and often, also, a loss of oue or more of the bases (of which the lime and iron are the first to go), through the dissolving agency of waters holding carbonic acid, or carbonates, in solution. Thus may come the following substances : 13. Hydrous Augite. Analyses 1, 2, 3 of an altered sahlite from Sala, Sweden, tho three analyses made on different fragments of the same piece, by H.

Saponite and serpentini (q. v.) are other results of the same kind of alteration, they consisting, like talc, of silica, magnesia, and water. Hortonite is a steatitic pseudomorph of pyroxene, found in Orange Co., N. Y., with chondrodite. The following are other kinds of pseudomorphs : Hematite, Limonite, Magnetite, Palagomte (which see). In the pyroxenes containing much iron, especially the augitic varieties, the protoxyd of iron, when moisture and air are present, may pass to a higher state of oxydation, and the mineral take a red color (the color of anhydrous sesquioxyd of iron (hematite), or it may take up water as well as oxygen, and become of a brownish-yellovi color, the color of the hydrous sesqui oxyd, or limonite. Magnetite is another result, and probably through the alteration of one of these oxyds as an intermediate state. Palagoniie, as Bunsen has observed, is one of the products arising in part from the change of the iron to a sesquioxyd : it is the material of many tufas of volcanic regions, as those of Iceland and Etna, such tufas having been made from doleritie or basaltic lavas abounding iu pyroxene. Bunsen remarks that palagonite may be made artificially by putting powdered basalt into a large excess of caustic potash in fusion and pouring on water; the product, after washing, is hydrated, pulverulent, and gelatinizes with weak acids, and its composition is like that of the purest palagonite of Iceland. For analyses, see p. 483. Epidote is another mineral resulting from the kind of change here mentioned. In one variety of the diallage from the gabbro of Harzburg (see analyses of others on p. 219), A. Streng found (B. H. Ztg., xxiii. 54) Si 45*73, Si 5-60, Pe 12-18, Fe 8-00, Sig 12*55, Ca 8*86, alkalies 0*55, fl 4-68=98\"15 \u2014 a percentage of oxyd of iron and of water which indicates partial alteration. Cimolite. Iu the case of the aluminous pyroxene, when all the bases except the alumina are removed and water taken up, there may result cimolite (q. v.), a w-hitish clay-like earth, which has been observed constituting pseudomorphs of augite at Bilin in Bohemia. In the change to this aluminous silicate, alumina may possibly be added, to some extent, from an external source, as from feldspar decomposing in the same rock. Pisani give3 the following composition of a greenish aluminous, although talc-like, pseudomorph having the angles of pyroxene (0. R., liv. 51): Si Si Fe Sig Ca Na K fl 56*52 20*49 2-67 5\"94 0'93 3\"32 3-88 7*40 Glauconite. Mica. Under the action of alkaline waters, alkalies may be introduced. Thus the hydrous mineral glauconite (q. v.) or green earth may result as a constituent of some augite pseu domorphs ; or the essentially anhydrous mineral mica, which has been observed by Kjerulf as a pseudomorph after augite, in the Eiffel. Kjerulf gives the following analyses (I) of an unaltered augite, and (2) the mica derived from it : Si Si Fe Mg Ca Na K Ign. 1. Augite 50-21 6 94 7-59 13-66 19-85 0-33=98-58 2. Mica pseud. 43-10 15-05 23-25 10-32 0-81 0'82 4'62 1 -50, with Ti 1-03 as impurity. Acmite (q. v.) is considered by Bischof and Rose a pyroxene altered by the alkaline process. Quartz. Opal Calcite. The removal of the mineral by the decomposing aud dissolving agencies may be attended by the introduction of silica from the waters present, these waters hav ing become siliceous as a consequence of tho decompositions. Hence may come siliceous pseudo morphs, either anhydrous like quartz, or hydrous like opal. One such from Vesuvius is described by Rammelsberg, which still contained some part of the bases, affording him on analysis (Pogg., lixx. 387): Si 85-31, Si 1-58, Pe 1-67, Sig 1*70, Ca 2-66, fl 5-47=98-42. In some rases the waters hold in solution carbonate of lime instead of silica, and this salt of lime consequently takes the place of the removed mineral, and so calcite pseudomorphs aster py roxene are produced. 22. Uralite. Augite also occurs altered to hornblende, and the product has been named uralite I y Rose(Pogg., xx. 322, 1830, xxvii. 97, xxxi. 619). The crystals have the form of augite, butthe cleavage of hornblende, 7A 7= 124\u00b0 ; they appear to consist of an aggregation of minute hornblende prisms. They are subtransparent in very thin lamin\u00e6, have a deep-green color, a greenish-white streak, with H.=5 or nearly, and G.=3-14\u2014 3-15, Ural; 3'273, Silesia, v. Rath.

If this be the case, the mineral may still be pyroxene or hornblende, as has been supposed. After an examination of the mineral, we regard with doubt the cleavage angle given by Breithaupt. Omphacite occurs near Hof in Baireut, Bavaria, at the localities mentioned above, and also at Pacher in Styria. It is intimately mixed with a lime-garnet, and also usually with kyanite, mak ing the tough greenish rock, spotted with pale garnet, called eclogyte. The rock contains often scales of a silvery mica. The name Omphacite is from pj/jpn^, an unripe grape, alluding to the color ; it is among the names of green stones mentioned by Pliny. 238B. Violan Breithaupt (J. pr.

Schlieper found his specimen (one furnished by the author and seemingly unaltered) to consist partly of carbonate of manganese and other bases. By digestion in concentrated muriatic acid, it afforded 90-15 per cent, of silicate of manganese, and 9*85 soluble portion. The latter gave on analysis' Sin C 50-52 Fe C 8*60 Ca C 37 17 Sig C 244 Sand loss 1-27=100. Ten p. c. of carbonates had been previously found in the Cummington mineral, by E. Hitch cock. Allowing that the ten p. c. of carbonates in Schlieper's specimen had been formed at tha expense of the bases in the rhodonite, and also that there was some free silica in minute points or grains, as was obvious to the eye, the oxygen ratio cannot be taken as different from that of rhodonite. Hermann's Mangan-amphibol (1. c.) was based on an analysis of this Cummington mineral Ruprecht, who published his first analysis of the species in 1782, obtained Si 55-06, manganese 35-15, iron 7'04, Si 1-56, water 0'78=99-59. Huot based his species Kapnikite on this old analysis. Brandes obtained for the Hydropiie, a rose-colored ore from Kapnik, having G. = 2-3 (Schw. J., xxvi.) Si 53-50, Sin 4P93, Fe 100, Si 1-24, H 3-00; it has been considered a tersilicate, with the formula Sin2 Si3 ; but it was probably an impure rhodonite.

The name is attributed to Jasche by Germar (1819), but is not in the Kleine Min., Schriften of Jasche (1817). Alt \u2014 There are two prominent methods of alteration, which may act separately or together. (1) Through the strong tendency of the protoxyd of manganese to pass to a higher state of oxy dation ; in which process the red color changes to brown or black, commencing with the exterior, which becomes a black crust to the mass. Indefinite mixtures thus result, which may be either partly silicate, or wholly one or more oxyds of manganese. (2) Through the tendency of the protoxyd of manganese and other protoxyds present to uuite with carbonic acid afforded by alka line carbonated waters, this causing the silicate to be penetrated with carbonate of manganese, and often also with carbonate of lime or iron. The color of the result after this latter method is usually grayish-red to grayish-white, and sometimes brown. I. By Oxydation ; not Hydrated or Carbonated. A. Marcelixe Berthier (Ann. Ch.

It afforded Brandes (ib., 136) 11 to 14 p. c. of carbonic acid, with some water. Corneous manganese (Hom-mangan of Jasche) is of similar nature, it containing 5 to 10 p. c. of carbonic acid ; color brown to gray. And so also the Cummington rhodonite, which afforded Scblieper 10 p. c. or more of carbonates. Analyses: 1, Berthier (1. c) ; 2, Berzelius (Schw.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs in mica schist with hornblende and mica in thin and long plates and fibres near Kongsberg iu Norway, and with gray cobalt near Modum. This species, originally instituted upon the Norwegian mineral analyzed by Gmelin and Vope lius, and regarded as distinct by many later authors, including Mohs, but united to hornblende by others, has recently been proved to be an independent species by Descloizeaux (Min., i.

R may correspond to two or more of the bases Jig, Ca, Fe, Sin, Na, fl, fl; and fi to Si, Fe, or Mn. *Pe sometimes replaces silica, like Si. Eammelsberg made out the geueral conformity of amphibole to the pyroxene formula by discover ing that the iron in both species was often partly sesquioxyd (Pogg., ciii. 284, and Min. Ch., 468). Yet the analyses do not all accord with this view, part giving the ratio 1 : SJ, unless the water is made basic. Much amphibole, especially the aluminous, contains some fluorine. The base lime is absent from some varieties, or nearly so. The name Amphibole, proposed by Haiiy, has the precedence, because Hatiy first rightly appre ciated the species, as he had done for pyroxene, and gave it, and not any of its varieties, the name. In his Traite, in 1801, he brought together hornblende and actinolite ; and by 1809 he had added to the group the third prominent variety, tremolite; while in all other works not taking their views from him, these three minerals still stood as distinct species. Asbestus was annexed to the* series by Hausmann in 1813, though kept separate long afterward by many other authors. The varieties of amphibole are as numerous as those of pyroxene, and for the same reasons ; and they lead in general to similar subdivisions. I. Containing little or no Alumina. 1.

Grammaiiie (from ypaiipn, a line) alludes to a line in the direction of the longer diagonal seeu by Haiiy ou transverse sections of some crystals. It was substituted for tremolite by Haiiy, without reason, and is a very bad substitute. Nordenskiiildite, from Ruscula, near Lake Onega, is tremolite (Kenngott and v. Hauer, 1. c.). Raphilite, from Lanark in Canada, is tremolite in its grayish-white or but slightly greenish color, and its low specific gravity (G.=2*85, Thomson; 2-845, Hunt). But both Hunt's and Thomson's analyses give over 5-30 p. c. of protoxyd of iron. In a letter to the author (dated Sept. 21, 1864) Hunt states that he obtained in one of his trials, from material which he had purified from mixed CaC, only 3*15 of protoxyd of iron, with Ca 12-05 and Si 57*20; and he adds that he regards this as nearer the true composition of the mineral. 1 a.

Nephrite or jade was brought iu the form of carved ornaments from Mexico or Peru soon after the discovery of America. Del Rio, in his Mexican Mineralogy (1795), mentions no Mexican lo cality. A similar stone comes from China and New Zealand. A nephrite-like mineral, called bowenile, from Smithfield, R. I., having the hardness 5-5, is serpentine in composition. The jade of ie Saussure is tho saussuriie (see under Zoisite) of the younger de Saussure, earlier named leman pte by Delametherie. Another aluminous jade has been called jadeite (q. v.) by Damour.

Contains magnesia and lime, with some protoxyd of iron, but seldom more than 6 p. c. ; formula (Ca, Sig, Fe) Si. The variety in long bright-green crystals is called glassy actinolite; the crystals break easily across the prism. The fibrous and radiated kinds are often called asbestiform actinolite and radiated actinolite. Actinolite owes its green color to the iron present. Named actinolite from 'apcrii., a ray, and XiOph, sione, as translation of the German strahlstein or radiated stone. Name changed to actinote by Haiiy, without reason. Tremolite graduates into actinolite through an increase in the proportion of iron, though generally easily distinguishable by its color. Asbestus has usually a grayish-white or greenish-white color, although actinolite in the proportion of iron ; and the raphilite (see preceding page) appears to shade into actinolite in composition. Tremolite does not differ in color from the aluminous variety, edenite, from Edenville, N. Y. (p. 235). 3. Magnesia-Iron Amphibole ; Antholite (Anthophyllite pt. (p. 231). Antholith pt.

Igelstrom considers the richierite of Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 364, 1865) the same mineral, as it has the same general aspect and similar composition, excepting half less manganese ; Breithaupt describes it as occurring in acicular crystals, affording the prismatic angle 133\u00b0 38' (which is within 5' of 7a i-i of pyroxene); with G. = 2'826; color isabella-yellow, rarely pale yellowish-brown ; B.B. very fusible.

Tremolite, actinolite, and other varieties of amphibole, excepting those containing much alumina, pass into fibrous varieties, the fibres of which are sometimes very long, fine, flexible, and easily separable by the Augers, and look like flax. These kinds, like the corresponding of pyroxene, are called asbestus (fr. the Greek for incombustible.) Pliny supposed it a vegetable product, although good for making incombustible cloth, as he states. The amianthus of the Greeks and Latins was the same thing ; the word meaning undefiled, and alluding to the ease of cleaning the cloth by throwing it into the fire. The colors vary from white to green and wood-brown. The name amianthus is now applied usually to the finer and more silky kinds. Much that is so called is chrysotile, or fibrous serpen tine, it containing 12 to 14 p. e. of water. Mountain leather is a kind in thiu flexible sheets, made of interlaced fibres ; and mountain cork (bergkork) the same in thicker pieces ; both are so light as to float on water, and they are often hydrous. Mountain wood (Bergholz, Holzasbest, Germ.) in compact fibrous, and gray to brown in color, looking a little like dry wood. Byssolile (Amianthoid, asbestoid) fr.

Named from tho locality at Edenville, N. V. To this variety belong various pale-colored amphiboles, having less than five p. c. of oxyds of iron. Breithaupt makes the edenite triclinic in B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 428, and he says that this is confirmed by Dauber. On an examination of crystals, the author sees no reason for adopting this conclusion. (b) Smaragdite Saussure (Voy. Alpes, iv. \u00a7 1313, 1362, 1796. Diallage verte pt. H., 1801 ; Green Diallage pt. Diallagon Ullmann, Tab., 90, 1814). A thin-foliated variety, of a light grass-green color, resembling much common green diallage. According to Boulanger it is an aluminous mag nesia-lime amphibole, containing less than 34 p. c. of protoxyd of iron, and is hence related to edenite and the light green Pargas mineral. Descloizeaux observes (Min., i. 90) that it has the cleavage, and apparently the optical characters, of amphibole. H.=5 ; G. = 3, Vauq. ; 3-10, Bou langer. It forms, along with whitish or greenish saussurrite, a rock. The original mineral is from Corsica, and the rock is the corsilyte of Pinkerton, aud the verde di Corsica duro of the arts. A similar smaragdite from Bacher consists, according to Haidinger, of alternate lamin\u00e6 of am phibole and pyroxene in twin composition. The euphotide of the Alps resembles corsilyte in containing a smaragdite-like mineral (green di allage). But Hunt states that the mineral has the cleavage of pyroxene, which our own examina tions have not succeeded in confirming. 10. Aluminous Magnesia-Lime-Iron Amphibole.

Pargasite is usually made to include green and bluish-green kinds, occurring in stout lustrous crystals, or granular ; aud hornblende the greenish-black and black kinds, whether in stout crystals or long bladed, columnar, fibrous, or massive granular. But no line can be drawn between them. Pargasite occurs at Pargas, Finland, in bluish-green and grayish-black crystals. Optical characters in general the same as for tremolite and actinolite (p. 233). But in one black crystal of hornblende (fr. Bilin ?) Descloizeaux found one bisectrix to be parallel to the plane i-i, and the other normal to it. Agaiu, in the bluish or black pargasite, from Pargas, the bisectrix is inclined 32\u00b0 58' to a normal to O, and 108\u00b0 to a normal to i-i ; and double refraction is positive. Descloiseaux observes that these distinctions are not sufficient to warrant the separation of these minerals. (a) Diastatiie is a black hornblende from Nordmark in Wermland, stated by Breithaupt to have 7a7=120\u00b0 20', and G.=3*08\u2014 3-11. (b) Syntagmatite is the Vesuvius black hornblende, analyzed by Eammelsberg (No. 29), in which he found 7a 7=124\u00b0 8', G.=3'272.

York, iii. 50), referred by Shepard to boltonite, is shown by B. Silliman, Jr. (Am. J. Sci., II. viii. 391), to pertain probably to an actinolite from Bolton. The fluorine in many hornblendes is supposed to exist as fluorid of calcium, and this ingredient, according to Bonsdorff, may constitute 1 part in 5 of the mineral. Pyr., etc. \u2014 The observations under pyroxene apply also to this species, it being impossible ti distinguish the varieties by blowpipe characters alone. Isomorphous and Dimorphous relations io Pyroxene.\u2014 The analogy in composition between pyr oxene and hornblende has been abundantly illustrated. They have the same general formula; and under this formula there is but one difference of any importance, viz., that lime is a prominent ingredient in all the varieties of pyroxene, while it is wanting, or nearly so, in some of those of hornblende. The analogy between the two species in crystallization, or their essential isomorphism, was pointed out by G. Rose in 1831, who showed that the forms of both were referrible to one and the same fundamental form. The prism 7 of hornblende corresponds in angle to i-2 of pyroxene ; that is, if the horizontal axes of the latter species be b : c, those of the former will be b : 2c. Calculating from the angle 7a 7in pyroxene, 87\u00b0 5', the angle of i-2 is precisely 124\u00b0 30', or the angle I A I in hornblende. The annexed table ex hibits the symbols of the planes in hornblende as they would be on the augite type. But while thus isomorphous in axial relations or form, they are also dimorphous. For (1) the cleavage in pyroxene is parallel to the prism of 87\u00b0 5', and in hornblende to that of 124J\u00b0. (2) The oa*iir ring secondary planes of the latter are in general diverse from those of the former, so that the crystals differ strikingly in habit ot system of modifications. Moreover, in pyroxene columnar and fine fibrous forms are uncommon ; in hornblende, exceedingly common. (3) The several chemical compounds under pyroxene have one-tenth higher specific gravity than the corresponding ones under hornblende ; that is, a compound (as, for example, (4 Ca + 4 Sig)3 Si2) having G.=3-2S under the former, has approximately, G. = 2'95 under the latter. Again, twins occur composed part of amphibole and part of pyr oxene, a fact bearing on the isomorphism and dimorphism of the species. Obs. \u2014 Amphibole occurs in many crystalline limestones, and metamorphic granitic and schis tose rocks, and sparingly in serpentine, and volcanic or igneous rooks. Tremolite, the magnesia lime variety, is especially common in limestones, particularly magnesian or dolomitic; actinolite, the magnesia-lime-iron variety, in steatitic rocks ; and brown, dark-green, and black hornblende, in chlorite schist, mica schist, gneiss, and in various other rocks of which it forms a constituent part. Asbestus is often found in connection with serpentine. Hornblende-rock, or amphibolyie, consists of massive hornblende of a dark greenish-black or blacK color, and has a granular texture. Occasionally the green hornblende, or actinolite, occurs in rock-masses, as at St. Francis, in Canada. Hornblende-schist has the same composition as amphibolyte, but is schistose or slaty in struc ture. It often contains a little feldspar. In some varieties of it the hornblende is in part in minute needles. Diabase is a fine-grained, compact hornblende-rock, tough and heavy. Aphanyte (or corneine) is like diabase, but is without distinct grains (whence the name, from ijiavm, unmanifesl), and breaks with a smooth flint-like fracture. Syenite is a granite-like rock, containing hornblende along with quartz and orthoclase feldspar. Durryte is a similar rock, grayish-white to nearly black in color, consisting of hornblende and albite. Hornblendic or syenitic gneiss has the same constitutien as syenite, but differs in having a gneissoid or semischistose structure. Hornblendic granite contains hornblende in addition to the ordinary constituents of granito, quartz, feldspar, aud mica. Gneiss and mica schist are often hornblendic in the same way. The hornblende in mica schist is usually in prisms, either stout or acicular, which sometimes are aggregated in sheaf-like tufts. The fasciculite of Hitchcock is merely this tufted hornblendes. Tho dark-green antique porphyry contains hornblende in its compact, diabase-like mass, and ii therefore called diabase-porphyry. G. = 2'9 \u2014 3'0."], [297, "241 BISILICATES. Hornblende is often disseminated in black prismatic crystals through trachyte, and also through other igneous rocks, especially the feldspathic kinds. Euphotide consists of a whitish or greenish compact base of varying constitution, with imbedded smaragdite. The euphotide of Corsica has been called corsilyte (p. 233). The saussuriie, as shown by Hunt (Am. J. Sci., xxviii. 336), is either compact lime-epidote, as that of the Alps, compact meionite, as that of Mt. Genevre, or compact feldspar ; these different kinds being distinguishable by their specific gravity. The compact tremolite called nephrite is found in talcose rock or schist, and granular limestone Aussig and Teplitz in Bohemia, Tunaberg in Sweden, and Pargas in Finland, afford fine speci mens of the dark-colored hornblendes. Actinolite occurs at Saltzburg and Greiner in the Zillerthal ; tremolite at St. Gothard, in granular limestone or dolomite, the Tyrol, the Bannat, Gulsjo in Sweden, etc. Calamile occurs at Normarken in Sweden, in prisms in serpentine. Asbestus is found in Savoy, Saltzburg, the Tyrol ; also in the islaud of Corsica, where it is so abundant that Dolomieu employed it in packing his minerals. Rock cork is obtained in Saxony, Portsoy, and Leadhills, where also mountain leather occurs. Oisans, in France, affords a variety of amianthus, composed of fibres having some degree of elasticity ; it is the amianthoide of Haiiy. In tho United States, in Maine, black crystals occur at Thomaston, at Moultenboro in syenite ; pargasite at Phipsburg and Parsonsfield ; radiated or asbestiform actinolite at Unity ; tremolite at Thomaston and Raymond. In N. Hamp., black crystals at Franconia. In Vermont, glassy and ra diated actinolite in the steatite quarries of Windham, Readsboro', and New Fane. In Mass., white crystals at Lee (li m. S.W. ofthe meeting-house), and at Newberg; glassy and radiated actinolite at Middlefield and Blanford ; radiated actinolite at Carlisle, Pelham, Windsor, Lee, and Great Bar rington; black crystals at Chester; asbestus at Brighton, Sheffield, Pelham, Newbury, Dedham; cummingtonite at Cummington and Plainfield. In Conn., in large flattened white crystals and in bladed and fibrous forms (tremolite) in dolomite, Canaan, between the Falls and the post-office, and also at other places in Litchfield Co. ; asbestus at West Farms, Winchester, and Wilton, and with mountain leather formerly at the Milford serpentine quarries. In N York, in good black crystals at Willsboro', presenting interesting forms ; also near the bridge at Potsdam, St. Lawrence Co.; near Greenwood Furnace, and in Warwick, Orange Co. (f. 229); dark green crystals near Two Ponds, and also 1 m. N., 24 m. N., and 1 m. S., of Edenville, together with gray or hair-brown crystals and tremolite, sphene, and chondrodite, in granular limestone ; of various forms and colors, and often in large and perfect crystals, near Amity; in dark green crystals, with ilmenite, at the Stirling mines, Orange Co. ; in short green crystals at Gouverneur, sometimes 2 or 3 in. in diameter, along with apatite ; iu Rossie, 2 m. N. of Oxbow, the variety pargasite in neat bright green crystals ; glassy and radiated actinolite near a hamlet called Pecksville, in Fishkill ; radiated at Brown's serpentine quarry, 3 m. N.W. of Carmel, Putnam Co. ; in large white crystals at Diana, Lewis Co. ; radiated and bladed tremolite at Dover, Kings bridge, the Eastchester quarries, Hastings, and near Yonkers, in Westchester Co. ; at Knapp's quarry, Patterson, in Putnam Co., and on the banks of Yellow lake and elsewhere in St. Lawrence Co. ; asbestus, near Greenwood Furnace ; Rogers's farm in Patterson ; Colton rock and Hustis's farm in Phillipstown, Putnam Co. ; near the Quarantine in Richmond Co., where the fibres are two to three feet long. In N. Jersey, tremolite or gray amphibole in good crystals at Bryam, and other varieties of tho species at Franklin and Newton ; radiated actinolite at Franklin ; tremolite at Franklin; asbestus and mountain leather at Brunswick. In Penn., actinolite in Providence, at Mineral Hill, in Delaware Co. ; at Unionville ; at Keunett, Chester Co., often in fine crystals ; tremolite with asbestus at Chestnut Hill near the Wissahiccou, near Philadelphia, at London Grove, Chester Co. ; nephrite at Easton. In Maryland, actinolite and asbestus at the Bare Hills in serpentine ; asbestus at Cooptown. In Virginia, actinolite at Willis's Mt., in Buckingham Co. ; asbestus at Barnet's Mills, Fauquier Co. Alt \u2014 The alterations of amphibole are similar to those of pyroxene (see page 220). The fibrous and diallage-like varieties are especially liable lo take up water, owing to the finely or thinly divided state of the mineral. Talc, steatite, serpentine, chlorite, biotite, pinite, chabasite, limouite, magnetite, iron oehre, are among the reported results of alteration. At Ilmenau, a magnesia-mica, a chlorite, and also (as an after product from the chlorite) iron ochre, occur as pseudomorphs after hornblende (v. Fritsch, ZS. Geol. Ges., xii. 104). Groppite, and perhaps rosile, as suggested to the author by L. S\u00e6mann (4th edit., p. 287), may be altered pargasite. Genth describes the asbestiform or fibrous serpentine of Texas and Providence, Pa., and the baltimorite as altered asbestus, and a chrysolite of Delaware Co., Pa., as altered actinolite (Am. J. Sci., II. xxxiii. 203). The following are analyses of altered amphiboles : 1, Smith & Brush (Am. J. Sci., II. xvi. 49) ; 2, Thomson (Min., i. 209); 3, C. A. Joy (Ann. Lye. N. H. N.

The hydrous anthophyllite of New York Island occurs in place near the corner of 59th street and 1 0th avenue, and also in many places in boulders. The variations in the analyses, as well as in the aspect of the material, show that it is a result of the alteration of an asbestiform tremolite. 247A Waldheimite. (Amphibol ahnliches Min. von Waldheim A. Knop, Ann. Ch. Pharm., ex. 363, 1859; Waldheimit Ramm., Min. Ch., 780, 1860.) An amphibole-like mineral, which contains much soda, and is peculiar also in its excess of silica, both suggesting that it may be amphibole altered by the alkaline process. It occurs in veins an inch thick, and resembles actin olite. H. = 5; G.=2-957; color leek-green; translucent.

It is to be observed that the excess of silica occurs along with an unusual proportion of alkali. 247B. Kokscharoffite. (Kokscharowit N. Nordenskiold, Bull. Soc. Nat. Moscow, xxx. 223, 1857.)

Gmelin referred to tachylyte a mineral from a porous volcanic rock in the Vogelsgebirge, to which Hausmann has since applied the name hyalornelan. It is similar in aspect, structure, and hardness; G. = 2*7144.

But little reliance can be placed on results with such amorphous minerals. The species may be the same with tachylyte. Hausmann places near here the slaggy augite cf Karsteu, having G. = 2*666, from a limestone bed near Guiliana, Sicily, from which Klaproth obtained (Beitr., iv. 190) Si 55-00, Si 16-50, Pe 13-75, Mn tr., Sig 1-75, Ca 10*00, fl 1-50.

There are, however, two prominent groups dependent on color, the color varying as chrome or iron is present ; but only the merest trace of either exists in any case. The crystals are usually oblong prisms. 1. Emerald. Color bright emerald-green, owing to the presence of chromium. G.=2-67, fr. Muso, Lewy; 2-63, fr. Pinzgau, Hofmeister ; 2-710 \u2014 2-759, fr.

Russi., i. 147, ii. 356, hi. 72, iv. 125 ; Hessenberg, Min. Not., v. 28. The varieties of beryl depending on color are of importance in the arts, when the crystals are transparent enough to be of value as gems. The principal kinds are : (a) colorless ; (b) bluish-green, called aquamarine, a name sug gested, though not used, by Pliny, where he says of it, \" qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur ;\" (c) apple-green ; (d) greenish-yellow to iron-yellow and honey-yellow (apparently chrysoberyllus of Pliny aud aucient jewelry) ; (e) pale yello wish-greeu (probably the chrysoprasius Plin., and perhaps his chrysolithus in part, as also in more modern times) ; (/) clear sapphire-blue (hyacinthozontes of Plin.) ; (g) pale sky-blue (aeroides Plin.) ; (h) the pale violet or reddish (amethiste basaliine Sage, Min., 231); (i) the opaque brownish-yellow, of waxy or greasy lustre. The above names by Pliny are mentioned in his account of beryl. The oriental emerald of jewelry is emerald-colored sapphire. Davidsonite is nothing but greenish-yellow beryl from near Aberdeen ; and goshenite is a colorless or white variety from Goshen, Mass. (anal. 16).

Glass with borax, clear and colorless for beryl, a fine green for emerald. Slowly soluble with salt of phosphorus without leaving a siliceous skeleton. A yellowish variety from Broddbo and Fiubo yields with soda traces of tin. Unacted upon by acids. According to Lewy, the emerald of Muso becomes white at a red heat, and loses, as a mean result, 1*66 of water and 0*12 of organic matter, the latter consisting of 0-03 to 0-05 of hydrogen and 0-09 to 0't)6 of carbon. Obs. \u2014 Emeralds occur in clay slate, in isolated crystals or in nests (not in veins), near Muso, eta 75 m. N.N.E. of Bogota, N. Granada, a rock containing Cretaceous fossils in its limestone* concretions. A perfect hexagonal crystal from this locality, 2 in. long, is in the cabinet of the Duke of Devonshire; t measures across its three diameters 2J- in., 2J- in., \\\\ in., and weighs 8 oz. 1 8 dwts. ; owing to Haws, it is but partially fit for jewelry. Emeralds of less beauty, but much larger, occur in Siberia, on the river Tokowoia, N. of Katherinenberg, along with phenacite, chrysoberyl, apatite, rutile, etc., imbedded in mica schist. One specimen in the Royal collection measures U\\ in. long and 12 broad, and weighs 10J lbs. troy; another is 7 in. long and 4 broad, aud weighs 6 lbs. troy. Mount Zalora, in Upper Egypt, affords a less distinct variety, and was the only locality which was known to the ancients. Occurs about Heubachthal in Salzburg, in mica schist. Trans] arent beryls are found in Siberia, Hindostan, aud Brazil. In Siberia they occur at the emerald mine mentioned, at Mursinka and Schaitanka, near Katherinenberg ; near Miask with :opaz; in the mountains of Adun-Tschilon with topaz, and elsewhere; in Hindostan at Canjar .gum; and in Brazil on Rio San Matteo. Some Siberian transparent crystals exceed a foot in length. The most splendid aquamarine of which we have any account belongs to Don Pedro, and is from Brazil ; it approaches in size, and also form, the head of a calf, and exhibits a crystalline structure only on one side; the rest is water-worn; and it weighs 225 oz. troy, or more than 184, lbs. ; the specimen is transparent and without a flaw. Beautiful crystals also occur at Elba ; the tin mines of Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony, and of Schlackenwald in Bohemia. Othor localises are, the Mourne Mts., Ireland, Co. of Down; also Killiney near Dublin; yellowish-green at Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, Scotland (davidsonite), aud elsewhere in Aberdeenshire ; in small bluish crystals at St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall ; Limoges in France ; Finbo and Broddbo in Sweden ; Tamela * Lewy found the limestone to consist of Ca 0 47*8, Mg C 16*7, Mn C 0*5, Si 24-4, Si 5*5, Be 0*5, 3?e 2-6, pyrite 0-6, alkali 2-7 = 101-2."], [304, "248 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. and Somero in Finland ; Fossum in Norway; Pfitscher-Joch, Tyrol; Bodenmais and Rabo.-.jteii in Bavaria ; in Australia, and elsewhere. Beryls of gigantic dimensions have been found in the United States, in N. Hamp., at Acworth and Grafton, and in Mass., at Royalston ; but they are mostly poor in quality. One beryl from Grafton weighs 2,900 lbs.; it is 32 in. through in one direction and 22 in another transverse, ano is 4 f. 3 in. long. Another crystal from this locality, according to Prof. Hubbard, measures 45 in by 24 in its diameters, and a single foot in length by calculation weighs 1,076 lbs., making it in al nearly 2| tons. At Royalston, one crystal exceeded a foot in length ; the smaller crystals are often limpid, and a yellowish variety forms a gem resembling chrysolite ; the colors are mostly aquamarine, grass-green, and yellowish-green ; one locality is in the southeast part of Royalston, near the school-house, on the land of Mr. Clarke ; the best crystals are imbedded in quartz ; a still better is situated 4 m. beyond the old one in South Royalston ; some crystals of a sky-blue color iu white quartz are beautiful. Other localities are in Maine, at Albany ; at Norway ; Bethel ; Hebron ; in Paris, large, with black tourmaline and mica; at Bowdoinham and Topham, pale green or yellowish white, in veins of graphic granite ; at Georgetown, Parker's island, mouth of Kennebea. In N. Hamp., at Wilmot; at Compton, as good as at Royalston. In Mass., atBarre, excellent specimens ; at Pearl Hill in Fitchburg, at Goshen (goshenite), and at Chesterfield. Hi Conn., at Haddam, in a feldspar vein in gneiss, on the east side of the river, the crystals having the terminations for a twelfth of an inch transparent (fig. 231, the dotted line indicating the limit of the transparent por tion! ; also at the chrysoberyl locality ; the Middletown feldspar quarry ; in Chatham, near the cobalt mine, in granite ; at Monroe, in a granite vein, the crystals often consisting of displaced pieces separated by quartz (fig. 233) ; at Madison, in beautiful crystals. In Penn., at Leiperville and Chester, crystals sometimes 10 to 12 iu. long and 14 in diameter, with black tourmaline ; at Mineral Hill. Kokscharof obtained from Ural beryls for the angle 0 A 1, 150\u00b0 3' 24\". The species dioptase and pyrosmalite are hom\u0153omorphous with beryl, and have the same oxygen ratio between the bases and silica, if the water and chlorine be excluded. Alt. \u2014 Kaolin, mica, limonite, and quartz, occur as pseudomorphs after beryl, the last two by substitution, the others by alteration. The change to kaolin is the same essentially as in feldspar.

In the preceding table the column of ratios contains the oxygen ratios for the protoxyds and silica or the deutoxyds and silica, where no sesquioxyd bases are present, as in the first, second, and third groups, and species 282 ; for the protoxyds, sesquioxyds, and silica, where the bases include elements in each of these three states, as in all the other groups. In species 285, the ratio is for the prot oxyds, sesquioxyds, tritoxyds, and silica. The letter r (species 268, 287, 293, etc.) signifies oxygen ratio between the bases and silica. This ratio is stated only when the silica is in excess above that of the unisilicate type, and it ex hibits the amount of that excess. Q is used in the second column of formulas for any accessory constituents not silica ; its value in each case may be derived from the part of the corresponding"], [310, "254 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. formula in the first column which is in brackets. In species 265 it stands for (Fe, Mn)Cb i\u00bb 284B, for Po A ; and so on. Examples of an excess of silica occur in many of the above groups ; namely, the Chrysolite group, in leucophanite ; Phenacite group, in mehphanite ; the Epidote group, in jadeite and per haps in saussurite; the Iolite group ; the Mica group, in muscovite, lepidolite, and cryophylUte ; Scapolite group, in wernerite, ekebergite, mizzonite, dipyre, marialite ; Nephelite group ; Leucite group, in leucite ; Feldspar group, in all the species excepting anorthite. It has been shown that this excess of silica is often connected directly with the alkaline nature of the base, and increases with increased alkalinity, as if the former were determined by the latter. The following are the ratios between the non-alkaline and alkaline portions of tho base in the above mentioned groups, as decided from the mean of the analyses, together with the ratios for the bases and silica : Bases Silica Non-alk.

Obs. \u2014 A common constituent of some eruptive rocks; and also occurring in or among metu morphic rocks, with talcose schist, hypersthene rocks, and serpentine; or as a rock formation; also a constituent of many meteorites. The eruptive rocks, basalt and basaltic lava, consist of chrysolite (the variety olivine), along with labradorite or other feldspar, and augite. Though usually in grains, it is sometimes in rectangular masses several inches thick. A chrysolite rock occurring at L. Lherz, consisting largely of chrysolite, has been called Lherzoly't (See p. 147, under Spinel). The dunyie of F. v. Hochstetter (ZS. G. Ges., xvi. 341 ) is the same rock, according to Sandberger. The latter has a grayish-green color, and greasy and vitreous lustre, with G.=3*295, and occurs with serpentine rock in Dun Mtn., near Nelson in New Zealand. Auother similar rock from Moravia, called picryte, consists half of chrysolite, along with feldspar, diallage, hornblende, and magnetite. Another from Norway (called Olivinfeh in German, or olivine rock) has very nearly the composition of puro chrysolite (anal. 9); G. = 3*24 \u2014 3*32, Kjerulf (1. a); granu lar in texture ; of olive to bottle-green color ; it contains some talc, tremolite, and bronzite. Occurs in eruptive rocks at Vesuvius, Sicily, Hecla, Sandwich Islands, and most volcanic isl ands or regions ; at Expailly in Auvergne ; at Unkel, on the Rhine, crystals several inches long ; at Kapfenstcin in Lower Styria, in spheroidal masses ; at Sasbach and Ihringen in Kaiser stuhl, Switz. ; near Freiburg, Baden, in dolerite, a variety containing much iron (hyalosider ite) ; iu Thetford and Norwich, Vermont, in boulders of coarsely cryst. basalt, the crystals or masses several inches through ; in dolerite or basalt in Canada, near Montreal, at Rougemont and Mouuts Royal and Montarvifle (anal. 26). In talcose schist, found near Kysehtimsk, N. of Miask, and near Syssersk in the Ural, in green ish imbedded nodules (glinkite, aual. 24); id. at Webster, in Jackson Co., N. C.

Most of the crystals are fragile, and therefore unfit for use as gems. Named from ypvt.6<, gold, and AiOjs. The hyalosiderite, from 'iiaXoi, glass, and aiinp\u00ab., iron. The Chrysolithus of Pliny was probably our topaz ; and his topaz our chrysolite. But Pliny's statement that \" topazos \" is the largest of all the precious stones, and that a statue 4 cubits high was made of it, shows that he confounded together different stones, since solid chrysolite crystals are never as large as some topaz crystals, and two inches is an extraordinary magnitude. The hardness mentioned, that it yields to the action of the file and wears with use, is right, and seems to prove that true chrysolite was included under the name of topazion. It came from an isknd in the Red Sea, and was very highly valued. It is stated by Diodorus Sieulus to have resembled glass, but to have had a remarkable golden appearance, especially conspicuous at night (King). Alt. \u2014 Alteration of chrysolite often takes place through the oxydation of the iron; the mineral becomes brownish or reddish-brown and iridescent Tt also splits into thin lamin\u00e6 as the change goes on, sometimes so as to resemble a mica. A basalt thus changed was once pointed out to thc author as a mica slate, although no further change had taken place than that here mentioned. Chusite, Limbilite, and Siderortepte of Saussure (J. de Phys., 341, 1794), all from Limburg in Brisgau, are chrysolite more or 'ess altered. The process may end iu leaving the cavity of the crystal filled with limonite or red oxyd of iron. Under the action of carbonated waters, the iron is often carried off instead of being peroxy dized, and also some of tbe magnesia is removed at the same time ; and thus may come serpen tine, picrosmine, which often retain the crystalline form of chrysolite. A further change may produce steatite and other magnesian species. For analyses of altered chrysolite see Walmstedt, in Ak. H. Stockh., 1824, and Ramm. Min. Ch., 441; Rhodius in Ann. Ch.

Artif. \u2014 Iron-chrysolito sometimes occurs in crystals as a furnace slag, as noticed by Hausmann in 1812, and later by Mitscherlieh and others. The vulkaniscfies Eisenglas of Klaproth (Beitr., v. 222), which afforded the above composition, was a slag according to G. Rose. It is a common product of the puddling furnace. 261. Iron-Manganese Chrysolite. (A. Erdmann, Ak. H. Stockh., 1849 ; var. olivine, his Min., 278, 1853.) Near fayalite, but contains, besides protoxyd of iron, some protoxyd of manganese aud lime, with also a little magnesia, approaching thus hyalosiderite. One of three agreeing analyses afforded Erdmann (1. a): Si Si Fe Mn Jig Ca 29-16 1-56 55*87 8*47 3*23 2*29=100*5S. It gives the formula, 6 Fe2Si + l Mn2Si+(Mg, Ca)2 Si, Rammelsberg. It occurs in a gneissoid rock called Eulysijte, consisting in part of augite aud garnet, at Tunaberg in Sweden. A. furnace-product, which is a lime-iron-manganese chrysolite, has been observed in clove-brown crystals at an iron-furnace in Easton, Pa. An analysis afforded Dr. C. T. Jackson (Am. J.

The name is from the Latin granatus, meaning like a grain, and directly from pomegranate, the seeds of which fruit are small, numerous, and red, in allusion to the aspect of the crystals. There are three promiuent groups, based on the nature of the predominating sesquioxyd. I. Autsiixagarnet, in which the sesquioxyd is mainly alumina (Si). H.

Chromegarnet, in which it is largely sesquioxyd of chromium (Sr). The protoxyd hases present, either singly or two or more together, are lime (Ca), magnesia (Mb), protoxyd of iron (Fe), protoxyd of manganese (\"bin), with rarely a fe w p. c. of protoxyd (?) of chromium, protoxyd of nickel, or yttria, or a trace of au alkali. Subdivisions of the above groups have been based on the predominance of one or another of these protoxyds ; and on this ground there are the following varieties or subspecies : A. Grossularite, or Lime-Aluminagarnet. B. Ptrope, or Magnesia-Aluminagarnet. C. AiMASiJiTE. or Iron-Aluminagarnet D. Spessartite, or Mangnnese-Aluminagarnei. E.

Excepting the last, these subdivisions blend with one another more or less completely through varieties containing combinations of tho protoxyd bases, and also of the sesquioxyd bases.

G.=3-64\u2014 4 Named Andradite by the author after the Portuguese mineralogist, d'Andrada, who described and named the first of the included subvarieties, Allochroite. The included kinds vary so widelj in color and other respects that no . ne of the names in use will serve for the group."], [325, "269 UNISILICATES. Chemically there are the following subvarieties : 1. Simple Lime Irongarnet iu which the pro toxyds are wholly or almost wholly lime. Includes : (a) Topazolite, having the color and trans parency of topaz, and also sometimes green ; although resembling essonite, Damour has shown that it belongs here, (b) Colophonite, a coarse granular kind, brownish-yellow to dark reddish brown in color, resinous in lustre, and usually with iridescent hues ; named after the resin colophony (c) Melanite (named from jmAus, black), black, either dull or lustrous ; but all black garnet is not here included. Pyreneite is grayish-black melanite ; the original afforded \"Vauquelin 4 p. c. of water, and was iridescent, indicating incipient alteration, (d) Dark green garnet, not distinguishable from some allochroite, except by chemical trials. Jelkiile is green garnet, light or dark, and yel lowish-green, from the moraine of the Findel glacier near Zermatt, Mt. Rosa ; named after Jellet, one of the describers of it. Calderite, a mineral from Nepaul, India, is said to be nothing but massive garnet ; but whether belonging to this group or not is not stated. 2. Manganesian Lime-Irongarnct. (a) Rothoffite. The original allochroite was a manganesiau irongarnet of brown or reddish-brown color, and of fine-grained massive structure. The Roth offite, from Longban, first analyzed by Rothoff, is similar, with the color yellowish-brown to liver-brown. Other common kinds of manganesian irongarnet are light and dark, dusky green and black, and often in crystals. Thomson's Polyadelphite was a massive brownish-yellow kind, from Franklin, N. J. (anal. 66, 67). The same locality affords another in dark green crystals, containing still more manganese. (b) Aplome has its dodecahedral faces striated parallel to the shorter diagonal, whence Haiiy inferred that the fundamental form was the cube ; and as this form is simpler than the dodecahe dron, he gave it a name derived from 'ajrXo'os simple. Color of the original aplome (of unknown locality) dark brown ; also found yellowish-green and brownish-green at Schwarzenberg in Saxony, and on the Lena in Siberia. 3.

The yellowish is the Jacinta.la bella; a yellowish crimson, the Guarnaccino ; and another very similar, Vermeille, or Hyacinth- Garnet; the red, with a violet tinge, Rubino-di-rocca, and also Grenat Syrian (from Syriam in Pegu), and probably the Ameihystizontes of Pliny. The deep and clear red, like Burgundv wine in shade, is the true precious garnet, which is either pyrope or almandite. The ancient name av8(m(, meaning a burning coal, alludes to the internal fire-like color and reflection, and was applied also to some ruby. The Latin name carbunculus, from carbo, coal, has tho same significa tion. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Most varieties fuse easily to a light-brown or black glass ; F.=3 in palmandite, spessartite, grossularite, and allochroite; 3*5 in pyrope ; but ouvarovite, the chrome-garnet from Canada (No. 84 included), is almost infusible, F.=6. Allochroite and almaudite fuse to a mag netic globule. Reactions with the fluxes vary with the bases. Almost all kiuds react for iron ; strong manganese reaction in spessartite, aud less marked in other varieties ; a chromium reac tion in ouvarovite, and in most pyrope. Some varieties are partially decomposed by acids ; all except ouvarovite are after ignition decomposed by muriatic acid, aud generally with separation of gelatinous sUica. Decomposed on fusion with alkaline carbonates. A brownish-red Arendal garnet, having G.=4-058, was reduced by heating to G.=4'046, and by fusion to 3-596\u20143*204, Church; and a Ceylon essonite, having G. = 3*666, had G.=3*682 after heating to incipient fusion, Church. Obs. \u2014 Garnet crystals are very common in mica schist, gneiss, syenitic gneiss and hornblende"], [327, "271 UNISILICATES. and Jilorite schist ; they occur often, also, in granite, syenite, crystal] ir< limestone, sometimee 'n serpentino, and occasionally in trap and volcanic tufa and lava. Garnet is sometimes found in the massive form as a prominent constituent of a rock. A white variety (lime-aluminagarnet) . occurs, forming, with a little serpentine, a whitish garnet rock at Orford in Canada, having G.=3*a2 \u2014 3-53. A similar garnei-felsite exists in Bayreuth iu Bavaria. At St. Framjois in Canada there is a yellowish-white and greenish-white garnet rock, consisting of the same garnet along with pyroxene, in the proportion, according to T. S. Hunt, of 57-72 of tho former to 40-71 of the latter, having G. = 3'33, and affording on analysis, Si 44'85, Al 10-76, Fe 3-20, Sig 5-24, Ca 34-38, igu. 1*10 = 99*53 (Rep. G. Can., 1863, 496). Eclogyie is a garnel-euphotide, consisting of a massive reddish garnet and grass-green smaragdite or omphacite. These garnet rocks are all very tough as well as heavy rocks. Many foreign localities of garnet have been mentioned in the preceding pages, under the head of composition and varieties. The best cinnamon-stone comes from Ceylon, in gneiss ; Malsjo in Wermland, in crystalline limestone ; on the Mussa- Alp in Piedmont, with clinochlore and diopside, where the crystals present the planes I, 2-2, i-2, J, 3-if, 0,1; at Mittaghorn, in Switzerland, with the same minerals, reddish-brown in color, and having sometimes the planes i-2 and f with / and 2-2 ; pale isabella-yellow at Auerbach, with the planes 2-2, /, 3-**-, i-2, i-\\ ; a brownish variety (romanzovite) at Kimito in Finland. A honey-yellow garnet in octahedrons occurs in Elba. Grossu larite of palo greenish color, comes from the banks of the Wilui in Siberia, in serpentine with idocrase, and from Cziklowa, in the Bannat ; in white or colorless erystpals in Tellemark, in Norway, and the Schischimskaja Gora, in tho Ural; also whitish in a resinopal pseudomorph after coral in Van Diemen's Land. Emerald-green crystals are found at Dobschau in Hungary. Almandite or precious garnet eomes in fine crystals from Ceylon, Pegu, Brazil, and Greenland. Common garnet is found in dodecahedrons 3 to 4 inches through at Fahlun in Sweden, Arendal and Kongsberg iu Norway, and the ZiEerthal. Allochroite, an apple-green and yellowish variety, of different shades, occurs at Zermatt in Valais, in geodes of crystals in chlorite schist ; brilliant black crystals (melanite) and also brown, at Vesuvius on Somma ; and in a volcanic tufa at Fras cati near Rome ; peak Espada and that of Ereslids near Bareges in the Hautes-Pyrenees (Pyrene -ite). Aplome occurs in yellowish and brownish-green crystals at Schwarzenberg in Saxony, and on the borders of the Lena in Siberia. Spessartite at Spessart near Aschaffenburg in Bavaria ; in the white feldspar of the granite of Elba, at St. Marcel, Piedmont, in pegmatite at Vilate near Chanteloube, Haute- Vienne ; at Broddbo, near Fahlun, in Sweden ; in a porphyritic trap, near Ilefeld in the Harz. Pyrope occurs in trap, tufa, and in the sands of the region, near Meronitz, Trziblitz, and Podsedlitz, in Bohemia, whero alone the variety used as a gem is obtained ; also at Zoblitz in Saxony, and the valley of Krems in Bohemia, in a serpentine rock. Ouvarovite is found at Saranovskaja near Bissersk, in the vicinity of Kyschtimsk, Urals, lining cavities or fissures in chromic iron; at Haule, in Rupshu, on chromite. Near Cauterets, the flautes-Pyrenees, largo crystals of brown garnet have a nucleus, easily separable, of dull green crystallized idocrase ; the containing rock is a compact gray limestone. in N. America, in Maine, beautiful yellow crystals or cinnamon-stone (with idocrase) at Par sonsfield, Phippsburg, and Rumford ; manganesian garnet at Phippsburg, as well as the finest yellow garnet in Maine ; in mica slate near the bridge at Windham, with staurotido ; in granite veins at Streaked Mountain, along with beryl; in large reddish-brown crystals at Buckfield, on the estates of Mr. Waterman and Mr. Lowe ; handsome red garnets at Brunswick. In N. Hamp., at Hanover, small clear crystals in syenitic gneiss ; blood-red dodecahedrons at Franconia, in geodes in massive garnet, with calcite and magnetic iron ; at Haverhill, in chlorite, some 14. in. ; at War ren, beautiful cinnamon garnets with green pyroxene ; at Unity, on the estate of J. Neal, with actin olite and magnetite, and at Lisbon, near Mink Pond, in mica slate with staurolite ; at Grafton, J to 1 in. in diameter. In Vermont, at New Fane, large crystals in chlorite slate ; also at Cabot and Cavendish. In Mass., at Carlisle, geodes of transparent cinnamon-brown crystals similar to figure 14, with scapolite in limestone ; at Boxborough, similar but less remarkable specimens ; also in gneiss at Brookfield and Brimfield ; massive with epidote at Newbury, and in crystals at Bedford, Chesterfield, with tho Cummington kyanite, and at the beryl locality of Barre. In Conn., trapezo hedrons, 4-1 in., iu mica slate, at Reading and Monroe ; at Haddam, ib. of manganesian garnet, often 2 in. through, with chrysoberyl ; at Middletown feldspar quarry, with octahedral faces (Shepard) ; at Lyme, large blackish-brown crystals in limestone. In N York, in mica slate, in Dover, Duchess Co., small; at Roger's Rock, crystallized and massive, and colophonite of yellow, brown, and red colors, abundant; brown crystals at Crown Point, Essex Co.; colophonite as a large vein in gneiss at Willsboro, Essex Co., with wollastonite and green coccolite, and also at Lewis, 10 m. south of Keeseville; in Middletown, Delaware Co., large brown cryst. ; a ciunamon variety, crys tallized and massive, at Amity ; on tho Croton aqueduct, near Youkers, in small rounded crystals, and a beautiful massive variety \u2014 the latter, when polished, forms a beautiful gem. In N. Jersey, at Franklin, black, brown, yellow, red, and green dodecahedral garnets ; also near the Frauklin furnace. In Penn., in Chester Co., at Pennsbury, fine dark brown crystals v 'ith polished faces, in Semite ; near Knauertown, at Keims' mine, in handsome lustrous crystals , at Chester, brown ;"], [328, "272 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. in Concord, on Green's Creek, resembling pyrope ; in Leiperville, red; at Mineral Hill, fine-brown, at Warren, black. Iu Delaviare, cinnamon-stone in trapezohedrons, at Dickson's quarry, 7 va. from Wilmington. Also at Knife rapids on the Mississippi In California, green with corppe: ore, Hope Valley, El Dorado Co., on Rogers' claim ; also with copper ore in Los Angeles Co., ic Mt. Meadows ; ouvarovite, in crystals on chromite, at New Idria ; iu Alaska, in large trapezohe drons, near Stickeen river ; pyrope, near Santa Fe, New Mexico. In Canada, at Marmora, dark-red ; at Grenville, a cinnamon-stone ; an emerald-green chrome garnet, containing 6 to 7 p. c. of oxyd of chrome, in Orford, Canada, in granular masses and druses of minute transparent dodecahedral crystals, with millerite and calcite (anal. 82); and in the same vicinity large cinnamon-red and yellowish crystals of garnet along with pyroxene. The cinnamon-stone from Ceylon (called hyacinth) and the precious garnet are used as gems when large, finely colored, and transparent. The stone is cut quite thin, on account ofthe depth of color, with a pavilion cut below, and a broad table above bordered with small facets. An octagonal garnet measuring 8J lines by 6J has sold for near $700. Pulverized garnet is some times employed as a substitute for emery. Alt. \u2014 Garnets containing protoxyd of iron often become rusty and disintegrated through the oxydation of the iron, and sometimes are altered, more or less completely, to limonite, magnetite, or hematite. The action of waters containing traces of carbonic acid and carbonates and silicates in solution, results in the same changes nearly as with pyroxene, producing at differeut times a loss, or alteration, of bases, or by a further change and the addition of water, steatite, serpentine, chlorite. The lime in the lime garnets may bo taken up by the carbonic acid of the waters ; and if magnesia is combined with the carbonic acid (forming a bicarbonate), it may take the place of the lime, and thus give rise to a serpentine or steatite pseudomorph, or to a chlorite, if the iron partly remains. Alkaline carbonates seldom produce the changes, for alkaline pseudomorphs are rare. An excess of silica is to be expected in analyses, according to Bisehof, since part of the bases are often lost through incipient change. Quartz also occurs with the form of garnet. Trolle Wachtmeister found in a crystallized, reddish-brown garnet, having G.=3*851, from Klemetsaune in Norway, which was partly penetrated by a whitish mineral, Si 52'11, Si 18 03, Fe 23-54, Mn 1-74, Ca 5-77 = 101-19, in which there is a deficiency of bases, or what is equivalent, an excess of silica, the oxygen ratio of bases and silica being 1 : 1 *7, instead of 1 : 1 . Schill fouDd in a melanite from Kaiserstuhl, Si 45*80, Si 11-00, Pe 12-33, Ca 22*10, Sig 2-00, Fe 7-16, Sin 0-70 =101 -09, giving for the oxygen ratio of bases and silica 1 : P34. Sthamer obtained for a massive garnet, of a dark grayish-green color, from Miask, having a serpentine-like nucleus, Si 46*11, Si 12-09, Fe 13-19, Ca 20-33, Mg 7-36=99-08, giving for the oxygen ratio of bases and silica 1: 1-3. Pyrope occurs altered to talc at its several localities. A serpentine pseudomorph after garnet, from Schwarzenberg in Saxony, afforded Kersten Si 34-24, Mg 33-28, Fe 3-38, Sin 0'41, Na 0-35, fl with some bitumen 10-62, magnetic iron 17'50=99-78=82-28 serpentine and 17-50 magnetic iron. Some garnets effervesce with acids, from the presence of carbonate of lime, wiiich they have re ceived probably through the action of waters holding carbonic acid or bicarbonates in solution, as, for example, a black garnet from Arendal, Norway, which contains both calcite and epidote ; and crystals from Tvedestrand, which are wholly calcite within, there being but a thin crust of garnet. Artif. \u2014 Melanite garnets have been obtained in a porous glass proceeding from the fusion of idocrase (Klaproth), and also of a melanite from Frascati (v. Kobell). Miller mentions the occur rence of garnet in crystals as a furnace product. Daubree and Studer state that crystals of garnet may be made by fusing together the constituents. Mitscherlich has also obtained garnets arti ficially (Ann. Ch. Phys., lxii. 219). Tritohite of Weibye, a hydrous species, is probably related in composition, as it is in form, to garnet and helvin ; it appears to give, although a sesquioxyd silicate, the garnet oxygen ratio 1:1.

The name Hyacinth was applied by the ancients to a bluish- violet stone, regarded as our sapphire, and was derived from a flower (lily) so-called of this color. [In modern mineralogy a hyacinth color is reddish-orange with a tinge of brown.] Intagli of zircon are common among ancient gems, and the fact that the lyncurium of Theophrastus was, as he says, used for engraved signets, while at the same time electric on friction, and often amber-colored, are the principal evidence that it was our zircon. Alt. \u2014 Zircon is one of the least alterable of minerals, as it contains no protoxyds, and only the most insoluble of peroxyds. It however passes to a hydrous state, and is attended ultimately with a loss of silica and the addition of oxyd of iron and other impurities derived from infiltrating waters. Auerbachiie, malacon, \u0153rstedite, tachyaphaltite, calyptolite, cyrtolite, are probably altered zircon. The following tetragonal zircon-like minerals are probably altered zircon.

Idocrase often contains some water, amounting occasionally to 3 p. c, the presence of which is probably due to alteration, and hence it is not to be included as part of the protoxyd bases. G Magnus found (Pogg., xevi. 347) in crystals from Slatoust, 2*44 fl ; from Ala, 2-98 fl; green. from Vesuvius, 0*29; in another, 203; brown, id., 1-79.

With the fluxes gives reactions for iron, and a variety from St. Marcel gives a strong manganeso reaction. Cyprine gives a reaction foi copper frith salt of phosphorus. Partially decomposed by muriatic acid, and completely when the mineral has been previously ignited. Obs. \u2014 Idocrase was first found among the ancient ejections of Vesuvius and the dolomitic blocks of Somma. It has since been met with most abundantly in granular limestone ; also in serpentine, chlorite schist, gneiss, and related rocks. It is often associated with lime-garnet and pyroxene. It has been observed imbedded in opal. At Vesuvius it is hair-brown to olive-green, and occurs with garnet, mica, nephelite, glassy feldspar, etc. ; at Ala, in Piedmont, it is in transparent green or brown brilliant crystals, in chlorite schist, with diopside, ripidolite, etc. Found also at Monzoni in the Fassa Valley ; at Egg, near Christiansand, Norway ; on the Wilui river, near L. Baikal (sometimes called wiluite, like the garnet of the same region) ; Cziklowa in Hungary ; in the Urals and elsewhere at localities above mentioned. In N. America, in Maine at Phippsburg and Rumford, just below the falls, in crystals aud massive with yellow garnet, pyroxene, etc., in limestone ; at Parsonsfield, with the same materials, abundant ; at Poland and Sandford (fig. 263). Iu Mass., near Worcester, in a quartz rock, with garnet, but exhausted. In N. York, 4 m. S. of Amity, grayish and yellowish-brown crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, in granular limestone ; also at the village, and a mile east of the village, of yellow, greenish-yellow, and yellowish-brown colors. In N. Jersey, yellowish-brown in crystals at Newton, with corundum and spinel. In Canada, at Calumet Falls, in large brownish yellow crystals in limestone with brown tourmaline; at Grenville in calcite, in wax-yellow crystals. For recent articles on cryst, see v.

It gives a=0-537541. Named Vesuvian by Werner, from the first known locality. Werner supposed the mineral to be exclusively volcanic ; but as this idea is not expressed, the name is no more objectionable than all others derived from the names of localities. The earlier name, Hyacinthine, is bad, as the mineral is not the hyacinth of either ancient or modern time. Haiiy's later name, Idocrase (sub jective, like many others of his) is from cUa, I see, and Kphms, mixture, in allusion to a resemblance between the crystalline forms and those of other species. Nothing in its signification, or iu any thing else, makes it right to substitute this for Werner's name. In English, the word vesuvian has the objection of being an adjective in form and use ; but this i3 avoided by giving it tho min eralogical termination above employed. Alt \u2014 Alterations nearly as in garnet, with a far greater tendency to becoming hydrated. Crystals from Maine often have tho exterior, though still brilliant and glassy, cleavable easily from the part below, and equally so, parallel to all the smaller as well as larger faces, so that a pealed crystal has as brilliant and even planes as before. Pseudomorphs include steatite, mica, clinochlore, diopside, and garnet. An egeran, analyzed by Ficinus (Sehrift Dresd. Min. Ges., i. 235), gave Silica 43*00, alumina 14*70, sesquioxyd of iron 2*40, ib. of manganese 400, lime 30*00, soda 5*33 = 99-43. It is probably in au altered state, as Rammelsberg infers from the description of Ficinus. The carbonic acid detected by Hermann in idocrase from Slatoust (anaL 23) is evidence of alteration, and this acid and alkaline or earthy carbonates or bicarbonates in solution, are agents by which change is often produced. Artif.\u2014 Mitsoherlich has obtained idocrase by artificial methods (Ann. Ch.

The species of the Epidote Group, enumerated with the formulas on p. 251, are characterized by specific gravity above 3, and therefore high ; hard ness above 5 ; fusibility JB.B. below 4 ; anisometric crystallization, and therefore biaxial polarization ; the dominant prismatic angle 112\u00b0 to 117\u00b0 ; fibrous forms, when they occur, always brittle ; colors white, gray, brown, yellowish-green, and deep green to black, and sometimes reddish. The prismatic angle in zoisite and other orthorhombic species is I A I; but in epidote it is the angle over a horizontal edge between the planes 0 and i-i, the orthodiagonal of epidote corres ponding to the vertical axis of zoisite, as explained under the latter species. T. S. Hunt has observed (C. R., 1863, Am. J. Sci., II. xxxvi. 426, xliii. 205) that the high spe cific gravity and hardness of the Epidote group, as compared with the Scapolite, is to be ascribed to a more elevated or higher multiple equivalent, or, in other words, to a more condensed mole cule. But the numerical value of the multiple, or of the relation between the species, has not yet been ascertained. 276. EPIDOTE. Schorl vert du Dauphine de Lisle, Crist., ii. 401, 1783. Strahlstein pt.

But this color passes into dark and light shades \u2014 black on one side, and brown on the other. Most ofthe brown and nearly all the gray epidote belongs to the species Zoisite; and the reddish-brown or reddish-black, containing much oxyd of manganese, to the species Piedmonliie, or Manganepidote ; while the black is mainly of the species Allanite, or Cerium-epidote. Var. 1. Ordinary. Color green of some shade, as described, (a) In crystals, (b) Fibrous. (c) Granular massive, (d) Scorza is epidote sand, of the usual green color, from the banks of tho Arangos, near Muska in Transylvania. The Arendal epidote (Arendalite) is mostly in dark green crystals; that of Dauphiny (Thallitc, De'phinite, Oisanite) in yellowish-green crystals, sometimes transparent, and found near Bourg d'Oisans, in the Piedmoutese Alps. PuscMinite includes pleochroic crystals from the auriferous sands of Katharinenburg, Urals ; G.=3'066 ; color emerald-green, when viewed by transmitted light through 1-i, yellow transverse to this ; named after Puschkin, a Russian senator. Achmatite is ordinary epidote, in crystals, from Achmatovsk, Ural. Escherite is a brownish-yellow, somewhat greenish epidote, from St. Gothard (anal 28). 2. The so-called Bucklandite from Achmatovsk, described by Hermann (anal. 41, 42), is black with a tinge of green, and differs from ordinary epidote in having the crystals nearly symmetrical, and not, like other epidote, lengthened in the direction of the orthodiagonal. G-=3*51. Hermann's Bagrationite, from Achmatovsk, appears to be essentially the same mineral, it agreeing with it in angles, according to Hermann (Bull. Soc. Nat. Moscow, xxxv. 248, 1862), and having G.=3'46, while the original bagrationite of Kokscharof is a variety of allanite (q. v.). It differs from the bucklandite in containing a little cerium (anal. 43). 3. Withamite. Carmine-red to straw-yellow : strongly pleochroic ; the color as seen through in one direction, deep crimson, iu another transverse, straw-yellow; H.=6\u2014 6*5; G.=3'137; in small radiated groups, i-i A-l-i=]16\u00b0, -I-i a l-i=128\u00b0 20'.

Breithaupt gives the angle 2*AP=154\u00b0 20', MaP=110\u00b0 30', which are very near O A 1-i, and -2-i Al-!'. From near Predmo in the Tyrol. Comp.\u2014 O. ratio for R, fi, Si=l:2:3; ft0a3-|-|(Fe, Sl))!Si3; being lime-iron-epidote, the mineral having for its protoxyd portion almost solely lime (Ca), but containing sesquioxyd of iron (Fe) in place of part of the alumina (Xl). The results of the larger part of the analyses conform nearly to the above ratio, showing apparently that it is the normal ratio. Several appear to afford, according to Hermann, less fi and Si in proportion to the R, giving different ratios between 1:2:3 and 1 : 1 \\ : 24 ; but with the sum of the oxygen of the protoxyds and sesquioxyds always equal to that of the silica. The exact condition of the iron, whether part is protoxyd or not, has not in all cases been ascertained, and, therefore, some of the results obtained are not free from doubt. Ram melsberg observes that when this point is cleared up the ratio 1:2:3 -will probably be found to be common to all The Achmatovsk \" bucklandite \" (anaL 41, 42) gives nearly the ratio 2:3:5; but if the iron be all sesquioxyd, 1 : 2-1 : 2-9. Rammelsberg says the crystals may contain some magnetite."], [339, "UNISILICATES. 283 The ratio of Fe to Si in most epidote is approximately 1 : 2, as in analyses 1 to 18, 23, 22-31, 33, 39 ; but other ratios occur between 1 : 2 and 1:6; and rarely the amount cf Fe is so large as to givo nearly tho ratio 3 : 5. Ratio 1 : 24 is afforded by analysis 19 ; 1 : 3 by 32 ; 1 : 4 by 24-26 28-30 ; 1 : 5 by 27 ; 1:6 by 23. In analysis 40, the silica is much below the usual proportion, and the 0. ratio for R, fi, Si is nearly 3:4:6. Analyses: 1, Geffken (Pogg., xvi. 483); 2, Kiihn (Ann. Ch.

G. of Arendal epidote changes on ignition, from 3*409 to 2*984. Obs. \u2014 Epidote is common in many crystalline rocks, as syenite, gneiss, mica schist, hornblendic schist, serpentine, and especially those that contain the ferriferous mineral hornblende. It often accompanies beds of magnetite or hematite in such rocks. It is sometimes found in geodes in trap; aud also in sandstone adjoining trap dikes, where it has been formed by metamorphism through the heat of the trap at the time of its ejection. It also occurs at times in nodules in dif ferent quartz-rocks or altered sandstones. It is associated often with quartz, pyroxene, feldspar, axinite, chlorite, etc., in the Piedmontese Alps. It sometimes forms with quartz an epidote rock, called epidosyte. Such a rock, from Grand Matanne River, Canada, having a hardness of 7*0. and G.=3\"04, gave T. S. Hunt, on analysis (Logan's Rep., 1863, 497), Si 62-60, Si 12*30, Fe 9*40, Mg 0*72, Ca 14-10, Na 0-43, ign. 0*19= 99*71, wiiich corresponds to 61*33 epidote and 38*22 quartz. A similar rock exists at Melbourne in Canada. Beautiful crystallizations come from Bourg d'Oisans, Ala, and Traversella, in Piedmont; Zer matt in the Valais ; near Gutauen in the Haslithal ; at Kaverdiras and Baduz in the valley of Tavetsch (the latter sometimes referred to zoisite, but optically epidote according to Descloizeaux) ; Monzoni in the Fassa valley ; Zillerthal in the Tyrol, sometimes in rose-red and greenish crystals of small size, resembling thulite ; the Sau-Alpe in Carinthia ; and the other localities mentioned above. In N. America, occurs in N. Hamp. at Franconia, crystallized and granular, with magnetite ; \"Warren, with quartz and pyrite. In Mass., at Hadlyme and Chester, in crystals in gneiss ; at AthoL, in syenitic gneiss, in fine crystals, 2 m. S.W. of the centre of the town ; Newbury, in lime stone ; at Rome, in hornblende schist ; at Nahant, poor, in trap. In Rhode Island, at Cumberland, in a kind of trap. In Conn., at Haddam, in large splendid crystals. In N. York, 2. m. S.E. of Amity, in quartz ; 2 m. S. of Carmel, Putnam Co., with hornblende and garnet; 2 m. S. of Coffee's Monroe, Orange Co.; 6 m. W. of Warwick, pale yellowish-green, with sphene and pyroxene; at Harlem, in gneiss, on the banks of East river, near 38th St. In V. Jersey, at Franklin, massive ; at Roseville in Byram township, Sussex Co., in good crystals. In Penn., at E. Bradford. In Michigan, in the Lake Superior region, at many of the mines ; at the Norwich mine, beautifully radiated with quartz and native copper. In Canada, at St. Joseph, in a concretionary argillaceous rock of the Quebec group. For recent papers on cryst. see Kokscharof Min. Russi., iii. 268, iv. 106 ; v. Zepharovich, Ber. Ale.

Epidote is one of Haiiy's crystallographic names, derived from the Greek i-iritoiji;, increase, and translated by him, \" qui a recu un accroissement,\" the base of the prism (rhomboidal prism) hav ing one side longer than the other. In its introduction Haiiy set aside three older names. Thai lite (from fluXXpj's, color of young twigs, alluding to the green color) was rejected because it was based on a varying character, color ; Delphinite aud Arendalite, because derived from localities. But the name Epidote is now so involved in geological as well as mineralogical literature that the law of priority cannot well do the justice demanded of it. Werner's name Pistacite from nurri/cta, the pistachio-nut (referring to the color) was not proposed as early as thallite or epidote. Alt. \u2014 Epidote is less liable to alteration than most of the silicates, partly because the iron it contains is mostly, when not wholly, in the state of sesquioxyd. The analyses afford generally one or two per cent of water, which is probably foreign to the species ; and in a green mineral from Isle Royale, having the composition of epidote, J. D. Whitney found 5 per cent, of water (Rep. Geol. L. Sup., 1851, 97). Artif. \u2014 Epidote has not been found among the crystallizations of furnace slags, or formed in the laboratory of the chemist. It has been a frequent result of the action of heat and steam on ferruginous sandstones accompanying the ejection of doleryte and other eruptive rooks; and this fact suggests the method by which it may be artificially formed. 276A.

Comp., Var. \u2014 This species, while closely like epidote in crystallization, varies much in the re sults of analyses, and also iu external appearance. The more prominent ways of variation are the following : ( 1 ) The crystals are sometimes broad tabular, and sometimes very long acicular. (2) The crystals, wheu well-formed, often manifest no double refraction, as Descloizeaux has observed. (3) The amount of water present varies from none to 17 p. c, and the hardness and specific gravity correspondingly, the kinds containing the most water being lowest ; and, in some, G. not exceed ing 2*53. (4) There is also much diversity in pyrognostic and other chemical characters, as ex plained beyond. The varieties that have been distinguished are as follows : 1. Allanite. In tabular crystals or plates, the crystals sometimes 8 to 10 in. long, 5 to 6 wide, and an inch or so thick. Color black or brownish-black. G.=3*60\u2014 3-95 ; 3-53\u2014 3-54, from Jotun.

Allan, the discoverer of the mineral, and found among specimens from East Greenland, brought to Scotland by C. Giesecke\". Cerine is the same thing, named by Hisinger, having H.=6; G. = 3-77\u2014 3'8; lustre weak, greasy; and being subtranslucent in thin splinters. Bucklandite is anhydrous allanite in small black crystals from a mine of magnetite near Arendal, Norway. Although not yet analyzed, it is referred here by v. Rath on the ground of the angles and physical characters (Pogg., cxiii. 281). That of L. Laach is also shown to have the angles of allanite by v. Rath (L c.) ; the angles are those cited above as the angles of tbe species. Taviolite Breith., is also from the trachyte of L. Laach, and is probably the same species.

It is pitch-black, gives a gray powder, and is nearly an hydrous. 2. Bagrationite. Occurs, according to Kokscharof, in black crystals, which are nearly symmet rical hke the bucklandite of Achmatovsk, and not lengthened, like uralorthite, in the direction of the orthodiagonal. Angles the same with those of uralorthite, after many measurements by Kokscharof. H. = 6-5. G. = 3*84, Koksch. Streak dark brown. B.B. intumesces and forms a black, shining, magnetic pearl. In powder not attacked by hot muriatic acid or by boiling nitric acid. Not analyzed. Named after the discoverer, P. R. Bagration. From Achmatovsk, Ural"], [343, "UNISILICATES. . 287 Hermann has described and analyzed what he calls bagrationite, from Achmatovsk, which he states has the angles of the bucklandite of Achmatovsk, and which, therefore, is true epidote (q. v.). The analyses by Hermann sustain this reference. 3. Orthite included, in its original use, the slender or acicular prismatic crystals, often a foot long, containing some water. But these graduate into massive forms, and some orthites are anhydrous, or as nearly so as much of the allanite. The name is from ipB6s, straight. The tendency to alter ation and hydration may be duo to the slenderness of the crystals, and the consequent great ex posure to the action of moisture and the atmosphere. H. = 5 \u2014 6. G. = 2-80 \u2014 3*75; 3'63 \u2014 365 from Fille-fjeld; 3*546, from Hitteroe, Ramm.; 3*373, Scheerer; 3-69\u2014 3\"71, from Swampscot, Mass., Balcli; 2-86\u20142-93, from Naes mine, 10 m. E. of Arendal, a hydrous variety containing 12 p. c. of water. Lustre vitreous to greasy. 4. Xanthorlhite, of Hermann, is yellowish and contains much water, and is apparently an altered variety; G.=2'78 \u2014 2*9. Named from (nuSos, yellow, and orthite. 5. Pyrorthite of Berzelius is an impure orthite-like mineral, in long prisms of rather loose tex ture, containing as its principal impurity some carbonaceous material (over 30 p. a), and show ing this in its burning before the blowpipe. Named from svp,fire, and orthite. From Kararfvot, near Fahlun. 6. Erdmannite, of Berlin, from Stiiko, near Brevig, is near orthite in composition. It occurs in imbedded grains and plates, with G. = 3-l, lustre vitreous, color dark brown, and is translucent in thin splinters. Named after Prof. Erdmann. Contains 4 to 5 p. c. of water. Allanite is a cerium-epidote. But, besides a large percentage of cerium, it contains generally the related metals, lanthanum and didymium, with also, sometimes, a little yttrium, and rarely traces of glucinum. The condition of oxydation of the iron has not been exactly determined in most of the analyses, and consequently the results are discordant. The best determinations, according to Rammelsberg, afford approximately, the garnet-ratio 1 :1 : 2, instead of the. epidote ratio 1:2:3, whence the formula (4 R3 + 4 R)2 Si3. In this formula R=Ca, Ce, La, Di, Fe, with sometimes Mg, Y, Mn ; and fi=Sl, Pe. Analyses 9-11 gave this oxygen ratio to Genth.

Foimula (J Ca + |Sl)2Sis=Silica 39*9, alumina 22*8, lime 37*3 = 100. The amount of sesquioxyd of iron varies from 0 to 6*33 p. c. ; if much more is present, amounting to a sixth atomically of the protoxyd bases, the compound appears to take the monoclinic form of epidote, instead of the orthorhombic of zoisite. Saussurite, accorpding to the analyses, has the 0. ratio for R, K, Si= 1 : 2 : 34, instead of 1 : 2 : 3, and it appears as if this was another case in which an increase of silica accompanies the increase of alkali in the bases. Both Hunt and Fikenscher's analyses give the 0. ratio 2 : 3J for the sesquioxyds and silica. Hunt's, however, has an excess of protoxyds. In a second analysis by Hunt (see below), the specimen contained mixed talc, amounting to 10 or 12 p. c. ; and if the magnesia in the first, and in Fikenscher's, is due in part to talc, this would subtract from the silica; and but a small reduction in this way would make the ratio 1:2:3.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. swells up and fuses at 3 \u2014 3*5 to a white blebby mass. Not decomposed by acid ; when previously ignited gelatinizes with muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 This species was instituted by Werner in 1805, first united to epidote by Haiiy and Bernhardi independently in 1806, and separated again from epidote on crystallographic grounds by Brooke, in 1 823. Descloizeaux has confirmed Brooke's conclusion by optical examinations, and fur ther has shown that the crystallization is orthometric, instead of clinometric. Thulite is referred to the species by Descloizeaux, together with the lime-epidote from most of the localities mentioned in connection with the analyses. The angle i-2 A i-i in thulite is near 152\u00b0. Brooke remarks upon the isomorphism of the species with euclase. Zoisite was so named after Baron von Zois, from whom Werner received his first specimens ; and Thulite, after Thule, an ancient name of Norway. The original zoisite is that of the Saualpe in Carinthia. Other localities are as mentioned. The gray mineral of Fichtelgebirge in Baireut, was referred here by Bernhardi (1. c, 1806), and both to epidote. Thulite occurs at Souland in Tellemark, in Norway, with bluish idocrase (cyprine), yellowish-white garnet, epidote, and fluorite ; also at the iron mine of Klodeberg near Arendal ; and at Traversella in Piedmont, forming small veins with talc and actinolite in granite. Saussurite forms with smaragdite the euphotide ofthe Alps, a rock which, as a result of glacier action, is widely distributed in boulders over the valley of the Rhone, and the country about Lake Geneva ; the boulders, as ascertained by Prof. Guyot, were derived from the chain of the Sassgrat, through the valley ofthe Sass, and are distributed to a distance of 150 m. from this place of ori gin. Found also in serpentine, in the Schwarzwald, but more or less altered (anal. 28). Hunt showed that both the very high specific gravity and composition identified the mineral with zois ite. (For other minerals that have passed under the name of saussurite, see Garnet, Meionite, Labradorite.) In the United States, found in Vermont, at Willsboro, in columnar masses ; at Montpelier, bluish gray along with calcite, in mica schist. In Mass., at Chester, in mica schist ; at Goshen, Chesterfield, Hinsdale, Heath, Leyden, \"Williamsburg, Windsor. In Conn., at Milford. In Penn., in W. Brad ford and W. Goshen, Chester Co.; in Kennet township and E. Marlboro; at Unionville, white (Unionise) with corundum and euphyllite. In Tenn., at Ducktown copper mines. Neither zoisite nor epidote has yet been found among furnace or laboratory products. On cryst, B. & M., p. 306 ; Descl., Min., i. 238. The crystal figured above by the author (and from the cabinet of Prof. Brush) is 4- in. long, but was attached by one side to a large imperfect crystal, and hence its planes were irregularly developed. The left 1-i and 2-4 were minute and somewhat rounded. The angle I A i-i by Descloizeaux's measurement, is 12 1 \u00b0 40', as given above ; Descloizeaux obtained also for i-i A i-2=162\u00b0 20', l-IA-J-i, top, = 120\u00b0 nearly; for i-i Ai-2=107\u00b0 13', whence i-2Ai-2=145\u00b0 34', and Miller found 107\u00b0 12', whence 145\u00b0 36'. Zoisite is closely isomorphous with epidote. If the figure 266 under epidote (p. 2S) is placed with the longer planes vertical, it then represents very nearly the form of zoisite ; the angle of this prism i-iAl-i is 115\u00b0 24', and -1 A-l = 109\u00b0 35'; and correspondingly, the prismatic angle of zoisite is 116\u00b0 40', and the brachydome 1-i has the summit angle 1093 20'. The position given the crystals of epidote by Haiiy has therefore a crystallogenic interest, and the name he applied to the species peculiar significance. 280A. JADEITE. Nephrite or Jade pt.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Gadolinite varies widely in its crystals, and physical and chemical characters, even in specimens from the same locality, and much more so in those of different. The crystals are usually rough and irregular, and sometimes oblique in different directions. Haiiy (Min., 1822), Phillips (Min., 1823), Levy (Min. Heuland, ii. 46), Kupffer, Scheerer (G\u00e6a Norvegica, 313), and Waage (Forh. Selsk. Christiania, 1864, and Jahrb.

Lang state that the crystals from Ytterby are sometimes oblique in the direction of one diagonal, and sometimes in that of the other; they adopt Nordenskiold's calculated results. Waage, who makes the form monoclinic, enumerates the planes O, I, i-i, i-i, 1, -1, 4, \u2014 \u00a3, 1-2, i-i, 1-i. His measurements were made with the reflective goniometer, and agree well with his cal culated results ; which, in addition to the above, are, Oa/=89\u00b0 31', OA 1=111\u00b0 29, 0a-1= 112\u00b0 21', OA|-i=136\u00b0 7', 1 A-l = 136\u00b0 10', I A 1 = 158\u00b0 8', IA -1=158\u00b0 2'. Waage points out a relation in angles to epidote, observing that the prismatic angle, 116\u00b0, which is nearly that of zoisite, corresponds to %-i A f-i in epidote (=115\u00b0 32'). The Ytterby crystals examined by v. Lang were partly altered. Descloizeaux found crystals from this locality part a mixture of double and singly refracting material, and part without any action on polarized light. Amid the diversity of results it is impossible to decide which is the correct form. The variations in composition are also considerable. The Ytterby, Finbo, and Broddbo gadolinite afford approximately the formula B? Si; that of Hitteroe, R8 Si3, the O. ratio between the bases and silica being approximately 4 : 3, as in euclase.

Decomposed by muriatic acid with gelatinization. Obs. \u2014 Gadolinite occurs principally in the quarries of Kararfvet, Broddbo, and Finbo, near Fahlun in Sweden ; also at Ytterby, near Stockholm ; at each place indistinctly crystallized, and in rounded masses, which are ofteu encircled with a yellow crust, and imbedded in coarse-grained granite. At Kararfvet crystals have been obtained 4 in. long.

If fl be basic, the O. ratio of bases and silica is 5 : 4, which is expressed in the formula (fl3, R3, fi)5 Si6. But in view of the variation in ratio in the analyses of the Elba mineral, and its opacity, we may reasonably infer that impurities are present (as staurolite exemplifies, p. 388), and that these impurities are mainly hydrated oxyd of iron, of the species gothite, which mineral loses its water at a high temperature.

The Germans, aud later the French, have rightly rejected the name yenite, on the ground that commemorations of political hostility or triumph are opposed to the spirit of science. Descloi zeaux adopts Ilvaile. A boulder from near Bytown, Canada, analyzed by T. S.

Obs. \u2014 Iolite occurs in granite, gneiss, hornblendic, chlorite and talcose schist, and allied rocks, with quartz, orthoclase or albite, tourmaline, hornblende, andalusite, and sometimes beryl. Also rarely in volcanic rocks. At Bodenmais, Bavaria, it is met with in granite, in crystals, along with pyrrhotine, blende, chalcopyrite ; the variety is the peliom of Werner, named from -(\"uos in allusion to its smoky blue color. It occurs in quartz at TJjordlersoak in Greenland ; in granite at Cape de Gata, in Spain ; at Krageroe in Norway ; Orijerfvi, in Finland (sleinheilite) ; Tunaberg, in Sweden ; Finspaong in Ostgothland ; Brunhult in Sudermanland ; Fahlun (hard fahlunite) ; Lake Laach, with sanidin ; at Campiglia Maritima, Tuscany, in a trachytic rock, containing also mica, quartz, and sanidin. Ceylon affords a transparent variety, in small rolled masses of an intense blue color, the sapphire d'eau of jewellers. At Haddam, Conn., associated with tourmaline in a granitic vein in gneiss ; sparingly at the chrysoberyl locality, in an altered or fahlunite condition ; abundant in quartz with garnet and yellowish-green feldspar, near tho Norwich and Worcester Railway, between the Shetucket and Quinnebaug, where the gneiss has been quarried for the road At Brimfield, Mass., on the road leading to Warren, near Sam Patrick's with adularia, in gneiss ; also good at Richmond, N. H., iu talcose rock, along with anthophyllite. Iolite is occasionally employed as an ornamental stone, and when cut exhibits different colors in different directions. Named lolite from lav, violet, and Xi'0jf, stone ; Dichroite, from its dichroism; Cordierite, after Cordier, the geologist, who first studied the crystal of the species ; Sleinheilite by Gadolin after Mr. Steinheil Lucas and Haiiy, who adopt cordierite, rejected the earlier names iolite and dichroite because the former is not always applicable, and the latter is equally applicable to various other stones. Epi dote, pyroxene, and a multitude of other names, if judged by the same code, would be found to have no better claim to recognition. Alt. \u2014 The alteration of iolite takes place so readily by ordinary exposure, that the mineral is most commonly found in an altered state, or enclosed iu the altered iolite. This change may be a sim ple hydration (fahlunite, etc.) ; or a removal of part of the protoxyd bases by carbonic acid; or the introduction of oxyd of iron ; or of alkalies, forming pinite and mica. The first step in tha change consists in a division of the prisms of iolite into plates parallel to the base, and a pp-arly foliation of the surfaces of these plates ; with a change of color to grayish-green and greenish gray, and pometimes brownish gray, is the alteration proceeds, the foliation becomes more com"], [357, "301 \"UNISILICATES. plete ; afterward it may be lost. The mineral in this altered condition has many names : as hydrous iolite, pinite, cataspiliie, fahlunite, bonsdorffite, esmarkite, chlorophyllite, gigantolite, praseolite, aspasiolite. Pinite, as far as it is altered iolite, includes properly the alkaline kinds. Fahlunite and the following, excepting the last, correspond to iolite + aq. In most cases if the water of the altered iolite be included with the bases, the oxygen ratio between the bases and silica becomes 1 : 1 ; it seems, therefore, quite probable that the strong tendency of iolite to take up water is owing to the fact that its silica (whose amount of oxygen exceeds that of the bases by one-fourth) is not saturated with bases. Regarding the water of the altered mineral as basic, esmarkite, chlo rophyllite, gigantolite, and praseolite will have the formula (R3, R) Si ; and fahlunite and bonsdorffite, containing twice as much water as the preceding, would have the formula (R3, fi) Si + fl. If 1 : 3 : 5 : 0 be the oxygen ratio for R, fi, Si, fl in iolite, 1:3:5:1 will be the ratio for esmar kite, etc., and 1:3:5:2, for fahlunite, etc. Weissite, iberite, huronite are names of other min erals supposed to be altered iolite. For the distinguishing characters and analyses of the different kinds of altered iolite, see Piniie, Fahlunite, and Cataspilite, under Hideous Silicates. MICA GROUP. The minerals of the Mica group are alike in having (1) the prismatic angle 120\u00b0 ; (2) eminently perfect basal cleavage, affording readily very thin, tough, lamin\u00e6 ; (3) potash almost invariably among the protoxyd bases and alumina among the sesquioxyd ; (4) the crystallization either hexa gonal or orthorhombic, and therefore the optic axis, or optic-axial plane, at right angles to the cleavage surface. Soda is sparingly present in some micas, and is characteristic ofthe hydrous species paragonite (p.487). Lithia, rubidia, and c\u00e6sia occur in lepidolite. Fluorine is often present, probably re placing oxygen. Titanium is found sparingly in several kinds, and is a prominent ingredient of one species, astrophyllite. It is usually regarded as in the state of titanic acid replacing silica ; but, for reasons elsewhere given, it is here made basic. 1. 0. ratio for bases and silica 1 : 1. 288. Phlogopite.

The species of the Mica group graduate into the hydrous micas of the Margarodite group (p. ) ; and through these they also approach the foliated species of the Talc and Chlorite groups, especially the latter. The micas were regarded as of one species until 1792, when lepidolite was made distinct. The earlier synonymy therefore may be conveniently given here."], [358, "302 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. Pliny probably included the mineral mica with the Lapis specularis (xxxvi. 45) or S&enile; and the shavings or scales of Lapis specularis strown over the \"Circus Maximus, \" to produce an agreeable whiteness, were probably those of a soft silvery mica schist. His Hammochrysos also (xxxvii. 73, named from i/i/ios, sand, xs\"\"76*! S0^) was probably sand from a yellowish mica schist, which abounds by the road-side in many mica-schist regions. Agricola speaks of the deceptivi character of this silvery and golden dust, as cited below. This silvery and golden mica in scales is the Cat-silver and Cat-gold of medi\u00e6val Europe.

The Sala mica of No. 6 has not been examined optically ; yet, as it agrees nearly in atorni . proportions with phlogopite, it appears to belong here. It was dark green in color, and inelastic, and is called chlorite by Svanberg ; the analysis is here cited from the original paper by Svanberg. Crawe's analyses afford the O. ratio 1*77 : 1 : 2*69=7 : 4 : 11, and Meitzendorff's nearly the same. The silico-fluorids in the former are about fa, and in the latter :,V G. of No. 5, 2-81, Rammels berg. Analysis 7, by Delesse, affords the O. ratio 3:2:5; and 8, about 44. : 3 : 9. The latter mica is a brown or greenish kind from the rock called by Delesse, Minette, occurring at Ser vance iu the Vosges ; tho ratio may become that of biotite when the state of oxydation of tho iron is ascertained ; G.=2-842. No. 9 gives the ratio 12| : 6 : 22^- ; it is from near L. Laach. Pyr., etc. \u2014 In the closed tube gives a little water. Some varieties give the reaction for fluorine in the open tube, while most give little or no reaction for iron with the fluxes. B.B. whitens and fuses on the thin edges. Completely decomposed by sulphuric acid, leaving the silica in thin scales. Obs Phlogopite is especially characteristic of serpentine, and crystalline limestone or dolomite. Occurs in limestone in the Vosges (anaL 7, 8). Includes probably the mica found in limestone at Alt-Kemnitz, near Hirschberg ; that of Baritti, Brazil, of a golden-yellow color, having the optical angle 5\u00b0 30' and parallel to the shorter diagonal (Grailich); and a brown mica from lime stone of Upper Hungary, affording Grailich the angle 4\u00b0 \u2014 5\u00b0.

Comp., Var.\u2014 Biotite is a magnesia- iron mica, part of the alumina being replaced by sesqui oxyd of iron, and protoxyd of iron and magnesia existing among the protoxyd bases. Black is the prevailing color, but brown to white also occur. The results of analyses vary much, and for the reason already stated \u2014 the non-determination, hi most cases, of the degree of oxydation of the iron ; and the exact atomic ratio for the species and its limits of variation are therefore not pre cisely understood. The O. ratio, which appears to be dominant, is 1 : 1 : 2, giving the formula (iii **+4fi)2Si3, which is the formula of garnet.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 Same as phlogopite, except that with the fluxes it gives strong reactions for iron. Obs. \u2014 Biotite was first shown to be optically uniaxial by Biot, after whom it is named ; and later, to be hexagonal in crystallization by Marignac (Bibl. Univ., 1S47, Suppl. vi. 300); Brooke and Miller (Min., 387); Kokscharof (Min. RussL, ii. 291); and quite recently, and after careful measurements, by Hessenberg (Min. Not., No. viL 15, 1866). But still the crystals are often slightly biaxial, as first remarked by Silliman (Am. J. Sci., II. x. 372, 1850), and W. P. Blake (ib., xii. 6, 1851); and later by Dove (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1853), Senarmont (Anu. Ch. Phys.. III. xxxiii. 391, xxxiv. 171), Grailich (Lehrb. d. Kryst., 1856), and others. On the ground of the biaxial character observed, Descloizeaux, in his Min., i. 88, 1862, made the species orthorhombic. Blake examined specimens from Greenwood Furnace ; a silvery-white var. fr. Easton. Pa. : a crimson from Topsham, Me. ; a fiery-red, by transmitted light, from Moriah, Essex Co., N. T. ; a dark bottle-green from Moor's Slide, Ottawa, Canada ; and seven different varieties from Vesuvius. But the divergence, which was in all very small was not measured. One of the uniaxial micas examined by Biot is stated by him to have come from Topsham, Me. Kokscharof found some crystals from Vesuvius true uniaxial. The following are the results of measurements by Senarmont and Grailich. (two or three of the micas perhaps phlogopites) : 1. Axial plane parallel to the longer diagonal. 1.

The Vesuvian biotite found on Mt. Somma (Meroxene of Breith.) occurs in brilliant crystals with numerous polished facets. Other foreign localities are named in connection with the anal yses. Tho mica from Greenwood Furnace, Monroe, N. Y., analyzed by von Kobell (anal. 1), occurs in large and very regular rhombic prisms (sometimes 5 or 6 in. across) oblique from an acute edge ; and also in tetrahedral pyramids ; the faces of the pyramids incline to the cleavage plane at 113\u00b0 to 114\u00b0 ; v. Kobell gives for the angle R/\\ R (faces of the pyramid) 71\u00b0 to 72\u00b0. This is the same mica with that analyzed by Smith and Brush (anal. 2, 3), as Prof. Brush has assured himself by an examination of von Kobell's specimens at Munich. Alt. \u2014 Rubellan is considered an altered biotite ; it occurs in small hexagonal forms, of a red color, in a kind of wacke. Steatite is also a result of the alteration of this species, as in granite atrBruun and Thierscheim. Among the above analyses, several indicate incipient change by the water and chlorine present. Mica, altered lo magnetite, has been observed in the Tyrol. The Eukamplile of Kenngott (Ucb., 1853, 58, 1855, and described under the name Chloril dhnliches Mineral in Ber. Ak. Wien, xi. 609, 1853) is a hydrous biotite, probably a result of alteration, from Presburg, Hungary. It is between mica and chlorite in its characters.

Obs. \u2014 A scaly-massive mineral at Persberg in \"Wermland, Sweden, containing imbedded prisms of hornblende, the scales half a line or so across ; mi*:a-like at Abborforss in Finland; in granite in Ireland, at Ballyellin in Carlow Co., Leinster, at Ballygihen in Donegal Co., and at Canton, moslly iu largish crystals or plates (4/ inch across and larger). The Donegal and Leinster Co. mica is optically uniaxial, according to Haughton. The granite contains also a white muscovite (see anaL 8-11, under Muscovite); gnd in some cases the black and white form parts of the same crystal ; and, where so, the optic-axial divergence of the muscovite was diminished, according to some trials, 20\u00b0. Named from Xtn-i's*, scale, and piXat, black. Alt. \u2014 Haughton gives the following as the composition of an altered form of the black mica of Donegal Co., Ireland (Nos. 5, 6, above); it was from Castlccaldwell : Si 31*60, Si 19-68, Fe 23*35, Fe 4*04, Mn 1*20, Mg 7-03, Ca 0-45, Na 0-74, K 3*90, fl 8-68=100-67. It approaches a chlorite. Pteeolite of Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 336) appears to be an altered lepidomelanc, of :i pearly lustre, and a color between olive-green and liver-brown ; scaly massive in texture. In tho analysis by R. Muller he found part ofthe mineral soluble in heated muriatic acid and part not and in analyses ofthe whole and the parts separately, the following results: Si Si Pe Fe fig Ca Na K S 1.

It occurs at Brevig, Norway, with astrophyllite, wohlerite, \u0153girite, etc. A Brevig mica afforded A. Dufrance (ZS.

Bastonite is a mica in large plicated plates, of a greenish-brown color, greasy lustre, very small optical angle, easily fusible into a black enamel, discovered by Dumont in a quartzite from Bastoigne, Duchy of Luxembourg (Descl. Min., 498, 1862). A brownish-black mica from RenehthaL in the Schwarzwald, with slight optic-axial angle and pearly metalloidal lustre, afforded Nessler (Jahresb., 1863, 820) Si 38'34, Si 33-80, Fe 13-73, Fo 7*40, Mg 0*36, Na 0*56, K 4*22, fl P36, F tr., ti 0*60=100*37. 291. Ann-ite Dana. The lepidomelane of Cape Ann, described and analyzed by J. P. Cooke (Am. J. Sci., II. xliii. 222), differs, according to the analyses, in having the O. ratio 1:2:3, instead of 1 : 3 : 4. In optical and other physical characters it is like lepidomelane. It occurs in plates and disseminated scales; H=3; G.*=3-169 ; color black; streak dark green ; opaque, except in very thin folia. Cooke obtained : Si Si Fe Sn Fe Sig Li K Na, fib fl SiF2 A.

B is deduced from A on the supposition that the mineral was mixed intimately (as a result of contemporaneous crystallization) with cryophyllite, an associated species at the locality, and that the amount of lithia indicated the proportion of cryophyllite. O. ratio deduced for the latter for fi, fi, Si, fl=6-2 : 12-1 : 19-9 : 1-6. It may be found that the biotites having the 0. ratio for fi, fi=l : 2 should be here placed.

Si 1 : 1}; rarely 1 : li, and for fi, fi either, approximately, 1 : (S, 1 : 9, or 1 : 12 ; fi=potash (K) almost solely. These ratios may hereafter prove to be different after a correct determination in each case of the degree of oxydation of the iron. Fluorine is present, but not over 1 p. c. has in any case been detected. Water is often present, especially where the latter ratio is 1 : 6 or 1 : 9 ; and it sometimes amounts to 5 p. c. ; and the kinds containing 3 to 5 p. c. of water have been referred to the spe cies Margarodite ; making the water basic in such kinds, the 0. ratio for bases and silica becomes 1 : 1, as in other unisilicates. The hydrous kinds so graduate into the anhydrous that the analy ses are hero brought all together, although the species margarodite is introduced on page 487. The ratio 1 : 14. may indicate that muscovite is a combination of 3 parts of a unisilicate and 2 of a bisilicate, as in the formula 3 (fi3, fi)2 Si3 + 2 (S3, fi) Si3. But if the mineral is a true unisilicate, as its relation to biotite and phlogopite would indicate, but with an excess of silica, the formula maybe (it3, fi)\" Si3+l-*j Si ; or else with half the excess of silica basic. With the 0. ratio 1 : 6 for fi and fi tbe bases correspond to fi; with 1 : 9, to ,% K3+,\\ fi; with 1 : 12, to h K'+tI fi. The analyses are here arranged in groups ; first, according as tho oxygen ratio between the bases (R+fi) and silica (Si) is 1 : IJ, or 1 : 14 ; and subordinates, into those in which the oxygen ratio between the protoxyds (fi) and sesquioxyds (fi) is either 1 : 6 approximately, or 1 : 9, or 1 : 1 2. It is to be remarked that the incipient alteration of a mica, attended with the introduction of a little magnesia, lime, or soda (Mg, Ca, or Na), with a removal or not of some potash (K), mighl increase the proportion of protoxyds and thus change the latter ratio from 1 : 1 2 to 1 : 6, or pro duce the intermediate gradations.

Sehafhautl obtained Si 40-69, Si 18-15, Fe 5*25, Na 1*23, K 11-1*8, II 0*60, Ca C 22-74= 99*82. It has also been called amphilogite. Probably only a mica schist. A variety of muscovite (1) composed of scales arranged in plumose forms is called plumose mica ; and another (2) having a diagonal cleavage, cleaving sometimes into thread-like pieces, prismatic mica. An emerald-green variety (3) is the fuchsite or chrome-mica, containing sometimes nearly 4 p. c. of oxyd of chrome. Pyr., etc. \u2014 In the closed tube gives water, which with brazil-wood often reacts for fluorine. B.B. whitens and fuses on the thin edges (F. = 5*7, v. Kobell) to a gray or yellow glass. With fluxes gives reactions for iron and sometimes manganese, rarely chromium. Not decomposed by acids. Decomposed on fusion with alkaline carbonates. Obs \u2014 Muscovite is the most common of the micas. It is one of tho constituents of granite, gneiss, mica schist, and other related rocks, and is occasionally met with in granular limestone, trachyte, basalt, lava ; and occurs also disseminated sparingly in many fragmental rocks. Coarse amellar aggregations often form the matrix of topaz, tourmaline, and other mineral species in panitic veins. Siberia affords lamin\u00e6 of mica sometimes exceeding a yard in diameter ; and other remarkable foreign localities are at Finbo in Sweden, and Skutterud in Norwaj-. See above for other locali ties. Fuchsite or chrome mica occurs at Greiner in the Zillerthal, at Passeyr in Tyrol, aud on tha Dorfher Alp, as well as at Schwarzenstein."], [368, "312 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. In N. Hamp., at Acworth, Grafton, and Alstead, in granite, the plates at times a yard across and perfectly transparent. In Maine, at Paris ; at Buckfield, in fine crystals ; at Unity, of a green color, on the estate of James Neal (Thomson's nacrite, wrongly referred to Brunswick).

On examining different micas pressed between two plates of glass, and subjecting them to changes of temperature, Senarmont found no perceptible change in the optical axes. Grailich shows that, with slight exceptions, the angle increases with the specific gravity in the mica of a given locality. Thus seven micas from Presburg, Hungary, gave the following: Specific gravity 2*714 2*735 2*755 2*782 2-790 2*793 2*796 Angle 69-7 70'0 70-5 7P2 72-3 72-4 72'0 Muscovite was so named by the author in 1 850, from Vitrum Muscoviticum or Muscovy-glass, formerly a popular name of the mineral. Fuchsite was named after the chemist, Fuchs. Talcite of Thomson (1. c), from Wicklow, Ireland, is nothing but margarodite, according to Greg and Lettsom (Min., 203), who say that it invests crystals of andalusite. Thomson, as his descrip tion implies, considered the andalusite prisms and investing mica all one mineral \u2014 the talcite; and bk view of this, the analyses need not here be cited.

Alt \u2014 Mica at times becomes hydrated, losing its elasticity and transparency, and often some portion of the potash ; and at the same time it may take up magnesia, lime, or soda The occur rence of water, magnesia, lime, aud soda in some micas, especially the margarodites, has been attributed to incipient alteration. See analyses under A, 1, and A, 2. These changes may be promoted by waters containing carbonates of these bases. R. Blum (Jahrb. Min., 1865, 269) gives the following analysis by Dr. Wolkenhaar of an altered mica (biotite ?) from the dioryte of Schemnitz, which had lost nearly all its alumina and consisted largely of carbonates: Si 33-34, Si 3*53, Fe 16-01, Sin 0*S9, Sig 2*06, Ca 21-73, Na 2*26, K 0 56, C 20*06=100*44. The carbonic acid would require the Ca 21-73, and Sig 2-06, with Fe 1*22, making 45 p. c. of carbonates. Mica occurs altered to steatite and serpentine, and Tschermak mentions cases of alteration to amphibole and stilpnosiderite. 294. LEPIDOLITE. Violetfarbigen Zeolith (fr. Rozena) v.

A list of the species of the Scapolite group, with their oxygen ratios and formulas, and the ratios of the non-alkaline to the alkaline protoxyd bases, is given on page 252. Although the oxygen ratios vary from 1:1:2, 1:2:3, 1:3:4, to 1:2:4 and 1 : 2 : 6fa, the species are closely alike in the square-prismatic forms of their crystals, in the small number and the kinds of occurring planes, and in the angles. The variation in the basal angle of the fundamental octahedron (1 : 1) for the species of the \u25a0group is less than 40', the extremes being 64\u00b0 13' (sarcolite) and 63\u00b0 40' (meionite). The species are white or grayish-white in color, except when impure, and then rarely of dark color; the hardness 5 \u2014 6'5; G.= 2*5\u20142*8 (2*932? in sarcolite). The alkali present, when any, is soda, with only traces of potash. Meionite was the first species of the Scapolite group distinctly recognized. It is, however, probable that scapolite was included with lamellar pyroxene under the name of White Schorl- Spar (Skorlspat) by Cronstedt, who mentions Pargas, in Finland, as one of its localities. The names Wernerite and Scapolite were both introduced by d'Andrada (of Portugal) in the same particle (Scherer's J., iv. 35, 38, 1800), and applied to specimens from the same region in Norway Wernerite is the first of the two in the article. Haiiy used the names Wernerite and Scapolite (supposing the species distinct) in his Traite of 1801. But in his Mineralogical Course for 1804 or 1805 arbitrarily set aside the latter for Paranlhine. Monteiro, a friend of d'Andrada, and \u25a0-.peaking in his behalf, protested in 1809 (J. de Phys., lxviii. 177) against the change, and after arguing that wernerite and scapolite were identical, both on chemical and crystallographic grounds, urged the adoption of the name Wernerite for the species. In the following pages the name Scapolite is retained for the group, so that the minerals may all be called scapoliles, as those of the feldspar group are called feldspars, and those of the mica and chlorite groups, respectively micas and chlorites; and the name Wernerite is applied to the most prominent division of tho old species. This course meets satisfactorily the question of priority, and also the convenience of the Bcience. 296. SARCOLITE. Sarcolite Dr. Thompson (of Naples), 1807.

Rath of specimens named nultallite, and attributed to Bolton, are evidently of altered crystals, as the presence of over 3 p. c. of oxyd of iron indicates. The coloi stated, \"blackish-green,\" is further evidence on this point. Moreover it is a very unusual color at the locality, as nuttallite is ordinarily white, grayish-white, and pale smoky brown, the darker \u25a0color occurring sometimes in crystals that are partly whitish. V. Rath states that the mineral was very difficultly fusible. Thomson's analysis (No. 3) was also made on an altered specimen, as it gave 5 p. c. of water. Muir, in an analysis of nuttallite published by Thomson (Min., 383) obtained Si 37*81, Si 25*10, 3Pe 7-89, Ca 18*34, K 7-30, fl 1-50=97*94. The potash and the low silica, as well as the iron, in dicate an altered specimen, if the analysis may be so far trusted as to draw a conclusion from it. The color of the mineral (white, to yellowish, bluish, or greenish) and the associated minerals on the specimen (sphene and green pyroxene) show that Muir probably had true nuttallite for in vestigation. Wurtz's analysis of the pink scapolite of Bolton gives more soda than tho rest. In a recent trial (priv. contrib.) B. S. Burton found about 3 p. c. of alkalies, sustaining Wolff's results. The bluish-gray massive variety from Malsjri has been analyzed also by Suckow (Verwitt. Min., 138), but as he found no alkalies, his results are questionable, either on the ground of the speci men or the analysis. He obtained Si 48*17, Si 28*27, Fe 2*38, Ca 19-04, fl 2'00=99'-86.

Pisani has analyzed a scapolite from Brakke, Norway, which pgives a composition between that of paranthite and wernerite. He obtained (C. R., Iv. 450) : Si 48*78 Si 32-65 Fe 0-87 Sig 145 Ca 13-32 Na 2-59 \u00a3 0*63 fl 1-30=101-29. It had been called Esmarkite. One of the minerals called saussurite by Boulanger, stated to come from Mt. Genevre, gave him G.=2*65, and the composition Si 44-6, Si 30*4, Mg 2-5, Ca 15-5, Na 7-5 (Ann. d. M., Ill Tin. 159). It is stated to be greenish-white and compact, and to occur associated with a greenish- 21"], [378, "322 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. brown smaragdite. In low specific gravity it is near scapolite. But we may suspect that there is some mistake about the specific gravity, in which case it may be zoisite (see p. 290) like other saussurite of the Alps. It agrees rather nearly with the latter in composition. Canaanite, a grayish-white or bluish white rock occurring with dolomite in Canaan, Conn., and referred to massive scapolite by some authors, is massive whitish pyroxene, a mineral com mon in crystals in the dolomite of the region. A so-called glaucolite from the L. Baikal region, analyzed by Bergemann (Pogg., ix. 267) and Givartovski (Bull. Soc. Nat. Moscow, 1848, 548) differs from the true glaucolite in being difficultly fusible (as much so as orthoclase), and also in composition, these analysts obtaining: Si Si Fe Mn Mg Ca Na fl fl 1. 50-58 27-60 0-10 0*85 3-73 10-26 2-96 1-26 1-73=99-07 Bergemann. 2. 6049 28-12 0'44 0*59 2-68 11-31 3-10 POO 1-78=99-51 Givartovski It was massive, of a greenish-blue color, with G.=2-721, Berg.; 2-65, Giv. It has been supposed to be a feldspar. Alt. \u2014 As the altered scapolites that have been derived from ekebergite or paranthite have not been distinguished from those derived from wernerite, the following observations are made to include all : In the alteration ofthe scapolites, one or more ofthe following changes occur, as illustrated in the following analyses of different kinds : 1. The hydration of the mineral. 2. The loss of part or all of the protoxyd bases, often effected largely through the action of carbonated waters carrying off the lime as carbonate. 3. The substitution of potash for the soda or lime, due to the action of the carbonates in solu tion in percolating waters. 4. The increase in the amount of soda, probably by the action of carbonate of soda or chlorid of sodium in solution. 5. The introduction of oxyd of iron, through salts of lime (organic, bicarbonate, etc.) m solution. 6. The substitution of magnesia for other protoxyd bases. 7. The loss of silica as well as protoxyd bases. By the substitution of potash, the mineral passes either to the state of pinite (anal. 8 to 15\\ or to that of a potash mica (anaL 15, 16). By the acquisition of iron (anal. 1 7 , 1 8) it passes in some cases to epidote (anal. 19). By the introduction of magnesia, it may pass to steatite; or of magne sia and potash, to a magnesia mica (anaL 20). By a loss of bases, the proportion of silica left increases (anaL 4, 5, 6, 21, 22, 23); and by a loss of silica also (which may become opal in its separation), the mineral passes to a kaolin-like compound, a common result of its alteration (anaL 24). Moreover, silica may remain, and the altered crystal become by additions a siliceous pseudo morph, as occurs at Pargas. Analyses: I. Hydrous. 1, Weibye and Berlin (Pogg., lxxix. 302). II.

The following are the characters of different altered scapolites, including those of which analy ses are above given : Atheriastite Weibye (Pogg., lxxix. 302, 1850). Anal. 1. Like scapolite inform; color green ish ; opaque. From Arendal, with black garnet and keilhauite. Stroganovite Herm. (J. pr. Cb., xxxiv. 178, 1845) (Anal. 2). Has the form of scapolite (Koksch. Min. RnssL, iii. 95). Color yellowish to light oil-green ; lustre greasy ; translucent ; H = 5 5, G.= 2*79. B.B. fuses easily with intumescence. From the Sliidianka in Dauria. The analysis af forded 64 p. c. of carbonic acid, which is above removed ;_ this corresponds to 11-4 p. c. of Ca C. Anal. 3. Large gray crystals, containing 9-23 p. c. of Ca 0; G.=2-74. In the anal, as above given, 4*06 of C is removed Occurs at Diana, N. Y., with sphene iu calcite. Anal. 4. White crystals with calcite, from Bolton; G.*=2*66. In the anal, as above given, 2*5 p. c of 0 is removed. Anal. 5, reddish massive, from Bolton; G. = 2-70. Anal. 8, massive, yel lowish ; H.=4-5 ; G. = 2'787. Contains 7 \"SO p. c. of Ca 0. From Bolton. Anal. 6. Whitish massive, from Gulsjo ; contains 344 Ca 0 ; G. = 2*69. In the anal, above, 1-5 p. c. of 0 removed. Anal. 7. Greenish or yellowish-green, cleavable, and partly in crystals, from Franklin, N. J., having H. =3-5, G.=2-78, with subresinous lustre ; B.B. very fusible. Contains 10*72 p. c. of Ca C. Aual. 9. Greenish-gray, waxy in lustre to pearly, subtranslucent, with H.=5*5, G.=2*640- 2*667; from Perth in Canada. Contains considerable magnesia as well as potash. Anal. 10. In grayish crystals, from Diana, associated with sphene. (Not from Bolton, as an nounced ; the specimen shows by its character and the associated minerals that it is unquestion ably from Diana.) Algerite Hunt (Am. J. Sci., II. viii. 103, 1849) (anal. 11 \u2014 13) occurs in slender square prisms, sometimes 2 or 3 in. long, imbedded in calcite. Yellowish to gray and usually dull. Brittle. H. =3\u20143-5; some crystals more altered, 2*5. G.=2'697 \u2014 2-712, Hunt; 2-78, Crossley. From Franklin, Sussex Co., N. J. The varying results of analyses, and the presence of carbonate of lime, of magnesia, and the relations to known examples of altered scapolite, confirm the view derived from the form and appearances, that algerite is an altered scapolite, and related to finite. Wilsoxite Hunt (Logan's Rep. Can., 1853 and 1863, Am. J. Sci., II. xix. 428) (anal. 14) is a mas sive mineral from Bathurst, Canada, affording square prisms by cleavage, and having H. =3*5, G. = 2*765 \u2014 2*776, lustre vitreous, a little pearly on cleavage surfaces; color red dish- white, rose-red, and peach-blossom red. According to Chapman (Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 269), its crystalliza tion and other characters are essentially those of scapolite. It is associated with apatite, calcite, and pyroxene. Thc oblique basal cleavage, mentioned by Hunt, is, as stated in the last edition of this work, p. 503, only a fracture. Hunt in Rep. G. Can. 1863 makes it a variety of gieseckite. Occurs also iu northern N. York. See further under Pinite, p. 479. Tereniie of Emmons (Rep. G. N. Y., 1837, 152) has the form of scapolite, with H. = 2 ; G.=2-53; lustre a little pearly ; color yellowish-white or greenish ; and is from a small vein in limestone at Antwerp, N. Y. It has not been analyzed, but is probably near algerite or wilsonite. Tho Pinitarligen (pinite-like) Scapolil of Schumacher (Verz., 98, 1801), from Arendal, is probably simi"], [380, "324 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. lar to the algerite and other pinite pseudomorphs. It is described as occurring in crystals aac massive, of a white, greenish, and other shades, and as B.B. fusing easily. His Talkartiger Scapo lit, from Arendal, appears to have been a steatitic pseudomorph, it being B.B. infusible. Mica from Arendal, Norway (Micarelle of Abildgaard). AnaL 15, 16. The mica occurs im bedded in quartz, and has, according to V. Rath (1. c), the form of 8-sided crystals of scapolite, 6 in. long. The crystals are covered with mica externally, and within consist throughout of an aggregation of the same mica. The mica is greenish-white, translucent. H.=2\u2014 3. G.=2*833. Oxygen ratio (from v. Rath) 1 : 6*6 : 10*5 ; perhaps 1:6: 10J, giving 1 : 1| for the oxygen of the bases and silica. The change from scapolite has consisted in the removal of lime, addition of Fe, and substitution of potash for soda. Mica from Pargas, anal. 20, is a magnesia mica. The red scapolite of Arendal (anal. 17) has H.=5 ; G.=2-852. Brownish or brick-red. Dif ficultly fusible. Oxygen ratio 1 : 2*4 : 7*5. In the change, Fe, magnesia, and potash have beeD introduced. The black scapolite of Arendal (anaL 18) is altered by a large addition of magnesia and iron Color grayish-black; streak grayish-white. Rather soft. G.=2-837. No cleavage. B.B. edges rounded with difficulty. 0. ratio 1:2-1: 2\"5 : 1-6, unless part of the iron is sesquioxyd. The epidote pseudomorph of the same locality (anal. 19) gives the oxygen ratio of epidote 1:2:3. The crystals occur imbedded in uralite. Forchhammer has described other epidote pseudomorphs after scapolite from Arendal, which are albite externally and epidote within. Gabbronite of Schumacher (Verzeichn., 1801) is referred here by S\u00e6mann, who observes that there are, in the Ecole des Mines at Paris, crystals of it of the form of scapolite (This Min., 50C, 1864). Schumacher describes it as bluish-gray, inclining to leek-green ; also grayish mountain green; lustre feeble ; fracture smooth like that of flint ; G. = 2*947; having some resemblance to gabbro. The bluish-gray variety from the Kenlig mine near Arendal, with black hornblende and calcite, and the other from Fredericksvarn, Norway, in syenite. The kaolin from Malsjo, anaL 24, is a reddish-yellow clay-like mass, retaining something of the crystalline form of scapolite ; G. = 24. The composition corresponds to 1 of alumina to 2 of silica. For another kaolin see under Ekebergite (Passauite). Steatitic pseudomorphs occur at Newton, N. J., and Arendal in Norway. A siliceous scapolite of Pargas, of a gray color, in limestone, contains 92-71 p. c. of silica. Albite is announced by Tschermak as occurring pseudomorphous after scapolite. Pseudo- Scapolite of N. Nordenskiold (Bidrag Finl. Min., 66, 1820) is wernerite altered to pyrox ene. The crystals are large and contain crystals of pyroxene, which are most abundant toward the exterior ; from Simonsby, near Pargas. 300. EKEBERGITE. Scapolite (fr. Arendal) pt. Wernerite (fr.

But a slight change in the bases would make the last 1:2:4-5; and it is probable that the mineral is an altered ekebergite. Fuchs made the prisms probably about 92\u00b0, and so also did Sehaf hautl. But Descloizeaux has found that it has but one optical axis \u2014 a negative one \u2014 and this decides it to be tetragonal in crystallization. Its colors are white to yellowish, bluish, and grayish-white. The crystals are coarse, and irregularly grouped or single. Pyr., etc. \u2014 In the closed tube yield a small amount of water. B.B. whitens and fuses with intumescence to a blebby glass. Imperfectly decomposed by muriatic acid.

Y., in limestone, with apatite and sphene, in short thick crystals sometimes several inches in diameter. The passauite is from Appcnzell, near Passau, in Bavaria. Alt. \u2014 The passauite is the source, by its alteration, of a large bed of porcelain earth or kao lin. Part of the kaolin has the prismatic form of the passauite. Fuchs found in one of his analy ses Si 45*06, Si 32-00, Fe 0*90, Ca 0-74, H 18*00, undecomposed mineral 2*90=99*66; in an other Si 43-65, Si 35-93, Fe POO, Ca 0*83, ll 18-50=99-91.

Obs. \u2014 From the region of the Hautes-Pyrenees, in granular limestone ; at Pouzae, near Bag neres-de-Bigorre, with a white uniaxial mica; near Libarens, about a mile and a half from Mauleon, with mica or talc; at the baths ofAulus in the Dept. of Ariege; in a black schist on the right bank of the Les, near Luzenac, Ariege ; in the vicinity of Loutrin, near Angoumer, in blocks of granular limestone, with pyrite, sphene. The prehnitoid is from a locality between Kongsberg and Solberg in Sweden, with coarsely crystallized hornblende ; its hardness is stated by Blom strand to be 7, and G. = 2-50. The name dipyre, from p*is, twice, and irSp, fire, alludes to the two effects of heat, fusion an&phos phorescence. Prehnitoid refers to a resemblance to prehnite. Alt. \u2014 Dipyre undergoes very easy alteration, much easier than wernerite, and this it probably owes to the large percentage of soda. At all the localities the mineral occurs to a large extent in a crumbling state. Some of it appears to be changed to a kind of greenish leuchtenbergite. Couseranite appears to be the same mineral in an altered form. It occurs in the same region, and the dipyre may be seen passing into couseranite. Its square prisms are usually rough oi rounded exteriorly, and bluish-black or grayish-black to deep black in color, but sometimes whit ish and blackish on the same specimen. It is often soft and fragile. Charpentier's mineral came from the department of Ariege (formerly Couserans). Analyses : 1, Dufrenoy (Ann. d. M., II. iv. 327) ; 2, Pisani (Descl.

Obs. \u2014 Nephelite occurs both in ancient and modern volcanic rocks, and also metamorphic rocks aUied to granite and gneiss, the former mostly in glassy crystals or grains (sommite), the latter massive or in stout crystals (el\u00e6olite). A doleryte containing much disseminated nepheline, such as occurs at Katzenbuckel, near Heidelberg, has been caUed nephelinophyre and nephelindoleryte. A granite-like rock found near Miask, in which el\u00e6oUte replaces quartz, has been named miascyte, from its locality. A rock composed of orthoclase, el\u00e6olite, and sodalite, from Ditro in Transyl vania, is the ditriiyte of Tschermak. The zircon-syenite of Norway contains much el\u00e6olite. Nephelite occurs in crystals in tho older lavas of Somma, with mica, idocrase, etc. ; at Capo di Bove, near Rome (the locaUty of the pseudo-nepheline) ; iu the cUnkstone of Katzenbuckel, near Heidelberg ; at Hamberg in Hessia ; Aussig iu Bohemia ; Lobau in Saxony. El\u00e6olite is found at Brevig, Stavern, and Fredericksviirn, Norway, imbedded in zircon-syenite ; in the Ilmen Mts., Urals, along with white feldspar, brown hexagonal mica, zircon, pyrochlore, etc.; at Mariens kaja in the Tunkinsk Mts., Siberia, with graphite, caucrinite, zircon. The crystal measured by Scacchi was of the variety sommite, or dacyne, occurring at Somma in a geode in limestone with sodaUte (Pogg. Erganz., iu. 478, 1858). El\u00e6oUte occurs massive and erystalUzed at Litchfield, Me., with cancrinite ; in the Ozark Mts., Arkansas, with brookite and schorlomite ; in a boulder, with sodalite, at Salem, Mass. Named nepheline by Haiiy (1801), from vcpeXfi, a cloud, in aUusion to its becoming cloudy when immersed in strong acid; elceohle (by Klaproth), from i\\aiov, oil, in aUusion to its greasy lustre, the variety having been made a distinct species earlier by Werner (1808), under the German name of Feltstein. The name sommite, derived from the Vesuvian locaUty, given in 1797 by Delametherio, has the priority. But Werner early adopted Haiiy's name, and later authors have aU taken the same course."], [385, "329 UNISILICATES. A mineral from Norway, of a yellowish-brown color, called phonite, is very much like el\u00e6olite, according to Descloizeaux. Alt. \u2014 Nephelite or el\u00e6olite is liable to ready alteration, and usually produces a zeolite, as thorn sonite. The Ozarkite of Shepard, according to Smith and Brush, is tliomsoniie (q. v.), and its situa tion in cavities in el\u00e6olite shows that it is a product of alteration. The large amount of soda in nephelite compared with the silica fits it especially for generating zeolites. Blum attributes berg mannite to the alteration of el\u00e6olite (Pogg., lxxxvii. 315, and cv. 133). Gieseckite is shown by Blum to bo a pseudomorph after this species. It differs maiuly in con taining several per cent, of water. It occurs in six-sided greenish-gray prisms of greasy lustre, in Greenland, having 0 A 1 = 135\u00b0 nearly; and also at Diana, in Lewis Co., N. Y., with the same angles, for the most part, although the results of measurement vary between 131\u00b0 and 139\u00b0. Tho crystals of Diana are hexagonal in cleavage ; yet the planes of cleavage are often separated by layers of a waxy appearance, without lustre or cleavage. According to Descloizeaux, the material of the crystals acts on polarized light like a pgum or colloid, and is evidently a result of alteration. Lielenerite, from the valley of Fleims, in the Tyrol, is considered by Blum a similar pseudomorph, and Descloizeaux sustains this conclusion. See further Pinite, under Hydrous Silicates. El\u00e6obte has been observed altered also to mica and opaL Davyne is regarded as altered nephelite, due to the introduction of carbonic acid, as stated above ; and cancrinite is supposed to have had the same origin. 304A.

Cancriuite is closely like nephelite in crystalline form, and it is probably identical with it in atomic ratio, excepting the carbonate and water, which may be due, as stated, to alteration. Davyne is intermediate in composition, and differs only in that it has the carbonic acid combined with lime alone. Whitney found a trace of chlorine in his analyses. The red color of the Miask cancrinite is due to disseminated grains of hematite, according to Kenngott, who also found calcite in micro scopic grains, and suggests that this may be the source of the carbonic acid of cancrinite.

Decomposed by muriatic acid without gelatinization. Obs. \u2014 Leucite is confined to volcanic rocks, and to those of certain parts of Europe. At Vesuvius and some other parts of Italy it is thickly disseminated through the lava in grains, and the name leucitophyr and also amphigenyte has been given to such lavas. It is a constituent in the nephelin-doleryte of Jlerches in the Vogelsberg (anal. 21); abundant in trachyte between Lake Laach and Andernach, on the Rhine. Vesuvius presents the finest and largest crystallizations. Near Rome, at Borghetta to the north, and Albano and Frascati to the south, some of the older lavas appear to be almost entirely composed of it. The leucitic lava of the neighborhood of Rome has been used for the last two thousand years, at least, hi the formation of mill-stones. Mill-stones of this rock have been discovered hi the excavations at Pompeii Named by Werner from \\wk6s, white, in allusion to its color. Haiiy's name, Amphigene, is of later date, and is from a/upi, both, and ycfvato, to make, in allusion to the existence of cleavage in two directions (which is not a fact), and to his inference therefrom of two \" primitive forms\" (which is only a notion of his) ; and it has therefore the best of claims for rejection. Alt. \u2014 Feldspar, nephelite, and kaolin occur with the form of leucite, as a result of its altera tion. The glassy feldspar pseudomorphs were first announced by Scacchi, and since by Blum.

FELDSPAR GROUP. The feldspars are characterized by specific gravity below 2*85 ; hardness 6 to 7 ; fusibility 3 to 5 ; oblique or clinohedral crystallization ; prismatic angle near 120\u00b0 ; two easy cleavages, one basal, the other brachydiagonal, inclined together either 90\u00b0, or very near 90\u00b0 ; cleavage a prominent fea ture of many massive kinds, and distinct in the grains of granular varieties, giving them angular forms ; close isomorphism, and a general resemblance in the systems of occurring crystalline forms ; twinning parallel to the clino diagonal section and O, and sometimes 24 (or the corresponding triclinic planes) ; transition from granular varieties to compact, hornstone-like kinds, called felsites, which sometimes occur as rocks ; often opalescent, or having a"], [392, "336 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. play of colors as seen in a direction a little oblique toil; often aventurine., from the dissemination of microscopic crystals of foreign substances parallel for the most part to the planes 0 and I. The protoxyd bases are lime, soda, potash, and in one species baryta ; the sesquioxyd only alumina ; the oxygen ratio of the protoxyds and sesquiox yds is constant, 1:3; while that ot the silica and bases varies from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1, tbe amount of silica increasing with the increase of alkali, and becom ing greatest when alkalies are the only protoxyds. The included species are as follows : CrystaUization. 0. ratio R, _3, Si A_NOETHrrE Lime feldspar Triclinic 1:3:4 Labradorite Lime-soda feldspar \" 1:3:6 Htalophane Baryta-potash feldspar MonocUnic 1:3:8 Andesite Soda-lime feldspar Triclinic 1:3:8 Oligoolase \" \" \" \" 1:3:9 Albite Soda feldspar \" 1 : 3 : 12 Orthoclase Potash feldspar Monoclinic 1:3:12 The species appear in tho analyses beyond to shade into one another by gradual transitions ; but whether this is the actual fact, or whether the seeming transitions (when not from bad anal yses) are due to mixtures of different kinds through contemporaneous crystallization, is not pos itively ascertained. The latter is the most reasonable view. It has been shown by Breithaupt and others that orthoclase and albite (or the potash and soda feldspars) occur together in infini tesimal interlaminations of the two species, and that the soda-potash variety called perthite (p. 356) is one of those thus constituted. This structure is apparent under a magnifying power, and also when specimens are examined by means of polarized light. Jloreover, these and other feldspars very commonly occur side by side or intercrystallized when not interlamiirated ; as oligoclase and orthoclase in the granite of Orange Summit, N. Hampshire, and Danbury, Conn. ; in obsidian in Mexico ; in trachytes of other regions. Such facts show that the idea of indefinite shadings be tween the species is probably a false one, since the two keep themselves distinct, and, in tho perthite and similar cases, even to microscopic perfection. They also make manifest that contem poraneous crystallization is a true cause in many cases. Intermediate varieties may also come through alteration under the agency of infiltrating waters. Water filtrated through powdered feldspar of any kind soon becomes alkaline by taking up part of the bases. Jloreover there is a strong tendency to alteration, and the final production of kaolin, a change involving the loss of all the protoxyd bases, and also much ofthe silica, the oxy gen ratio of the silica and alumina being thus reduced to 1 : 1. from 3 : 1 in orthoclase or albite, and from 2 : 1 in labradorite. The species andesite is still a doubtful one. The play of colors, especially remarkable in much labradorite, and occurring also in some adularia, albite, and oligoclase, indicates, according to Reusch (Pogg., cxvi. 392, cxviii. 256, cxx. 95), the existence of a cleavage structure of extreme delicacy transverso to the median or brachydiagonal section. In adularia the plane of this cleavage is perpendicular to this section (or that of the clinodiagonal); in labradorite it is in general more or less inclined, and differently in different specimens. The play of color, Reusch observes, appears therefore to be that of thin plates ; yet the linings of what he regards as a cleavage system appear to be of indis tinguishable minuteness; and although the existence of thin plates can hardly be established by means of the microscope, it is proved by their effects in the play of colors, nebulous images within, and the phenomena of inflexion or diffraction which result from their regular grouping. There ap pears to be no connection between the inclination of the plane in labradorite and the colors observed. The play of colors is best seen on a plate polished parallel to the brachydiagonal section (i-i), when, as Descloizeaux states, it is turned to the right or left on an axis slightly oblique to the face, which extends toward the obtuse angle between the edges O/i-i and I' /i-i, and makes an angle of about 70\u00b0 with the edge O/i-i; and the maximum effect is produced iu two positions situated 45\u00b0 to 00\u00b0 from one another, which are unequally inclined to the face i-i. The play of colors is indepen i snt of the disseminated microscopic crystals of foreign substances which occasion the aventurine effect. The feldspars are intimately related to the isometric species of the Leucite group. Leucite has the oxygen ratio 1:3:8, one of the feldspar ratios ; so that isometric leucite, monoclinic hy alophane, and triclinic andesite (if this species is sustained), form a trimorphous group. But"], [393, "337 UNISILICATES. while the form of leucite appears at first sight to be very unlike that of the true feldspars, there is actually approximate isomorphism. For the monoclinic and triclinic forms are strictly oblique or clinohedrized dodecahedrons.* If a dodecahedron be so placed that an octahedral axis, that is, the line between the apices ol IWU Ui _UU 11 111*. U_l ill BUilU UllgltS, IB Vt.i_lL--l, it IS tUyit d> SLX-SIUCU pOSlU with trihedral summits. If now this axis be inclined 8\u00b0 6' in one ofthe diametral planes of the six-sided prism, it will have the inclination of the axis of orthoclase ; and this 8\u00b0 6' is the greatest amount of divergence from tho dodecahedral angles that occurs in the species. The planes /, i-i incline to one another at angles near 120\u00b0, and correspond to the 6 vertical planes of the dodecahedron (as above placed). The basal plane 0 is also dodecahedric, for 0 A _T= 1 22\u00b0 16', and 0 A i-i (dodecahe iric)=90\u00b0. The four planes 1 are also dodecahedric, as shown by their position and incUnations. Thus aU the twelve faces of the dode cahedron occur in the above figure ; they are lettered D. Again, the planes _-3 and 1-i, which replace the edges between the dodecahedric planes /, i-i and 1,1, with angles near 150\u00b0, correspond to planes of the trapezohedron 2-2 (that truncating the dodecahedron, f. 14), and consequently the figure contains six trapezohedric planes ; they are lettered T. Again, the planes 2-i are cubic ; for they make with the dodecahe dric plane 0 the angle 135\u00b0 3', varying but 3' from the isometric angle. 2-t is another cubic face ; it is inclined to I, a dodecahedric 296 plane, 134\u00b0 19'. There are present, therefore, all six faces ofthe cube; they are lettered H. Finally the plane f-i, at the top of the figure (and the only remaining one), lettered O, is octahe dric, as shown by its intersections with the cubic, dodecahedric, and trapezohedric faces ; and also by its incliuation to the cubic face 2-1=124\u00b0 51', and to the dodecahedric face 7=145\u00b0 47', these angles in isometric forms being 125\u00b0 16' and 144\u00b0 44'. It follows then that the above figure contains the dodecahedric planes I, I, i-i, 0, 1, 1, with their opposites, or the whole twelve; the trapezohedric i-i, i-i, 1-i, with their opposites, or six; the oddhedric, \\-i, with its opposite, or two; and the cubic 2-i, 2-i, 2-i, or all six; and no others. The angles of the oblique cube are 2-t A 2-2, over O,=90\u00b0 6', 2-i A 2-p*=96\u00b0 48'. Moreover, the normal apex of the clinohedrized dodecahedron is that part of the crystal occupied by the octahedric piano jj-i ; in other words, \u00a7-**.' is normally the basal plane, and not 0 ; and the true inclination of the vertical axis is 8\u00b0 6' (the angle %-i Ai-i being 98\u00b0 6'). Accordingly the two cleavages in orthoclase, parallel to 0 and i-i, are both dodecahedric. Moreover, the directions of twinning are either dodecahedric (parallel to i-i, which is the most common, and 0), or cubic (parallel to 2-11. These relations hold true also for the triclinic feldspars, the only peculiarity in which is that the principal section has slight lateral obliquity, so that the two cleavage plaues (dodecahedric) incline to one another 93\u00b0 15' to 94\u00b0 15' instead of 90'. G. Rose, in an article on albite (Pogg., exxv. 457), alludes to the remarkable fact that the plaues 2-i (see p. 349), either side of 0, make with one another in this species very nearly a right angle (90\u00b0 35', Neumann, aud 90\u00b0 4', Descloi zeaux). The fact is not so surprising when it is observed that the planes 2-Iare cubic faces. They correspond to 2-i in orthoclase. 310. ANORTHITE. INDIANITE.

Anorthite (chrisiianite and bioiine) occurs at Mount Vesuvius in isolated blocks among the old javas iu the ravines of Jlonte Somma, associated with sanidin, augite, mica, and idocrase ; on the island of Procida near the entrance to the bay of Naples ; in the Faroe islands, and on Java ; on Iceland, on the plain of Thiorsd, Hecla, and elsewhere (G. = 2*69\u2014 2*75); near Bogoslovsk in the"], [396, "340 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. Ural (G.=2-72\u2014 2*73, anal. 23, 24); at Carlingford in Ireland ; in the meteoric stcue of Juvenaf (anal. 27). Amphodelite occurs in Lojo, Finland, in a limestone quarry, and at Tunaberg, Sweden ; lepolite, at Lojo and Orrijarfvi ; linseite is probably the same partly altered (Breith., J. pr. Ch., xlvii. 236), containing a few p. c. of water. Latrobite is from Amitok island, on the coast of Labrador Indianite is the gangue of corundum in the Carnatic, with garnet, cyanite, and hornblende ; th\u00ab specimen analyzed by G. J. Brush was originally from the hands of Count Bournon, and came from the Indian locality. Anorthite was named in 1823 by Rose from duopB^, oblique, the crystallization being triclinic. Bournon's name, Indianite, derived from the locality in India, was first published in his Catalogue ofthe Royal Mineralogical Collection, in the year 1817. The species had been described by him as early as 1802 (1. c), and his description is remarkably complete for the time, it including, besides physics characters, a chemical analysis by Chenevix (anal. 1 above) agreeing nearly in essential points with the later by Rose, and quite as well as his, with the true or normal composition of the mineral. Bournon supposed that the grains might be rhombohedral in crystallization ; but Brooke, in Phillips' Mineralogy (3d ed.), published in 1823, the year of Rose's publication, an nounced that there were two cleavages, inclined to one another 84\u00b0 45' and 95\u00b0 15', differing not widely from the same angle ( 0 /. i-i) as ascertained by Rose. Justice seems to require tiiat Bournon's name should be restored to the species. Beudant, in the first edition of his mineralogy, published in 1824, describes indianite in full and called it lime-feldspar, mentioning anorthite only in his index. Christianity was named by Monticelli and Covelli after the prince pChristian Friedrick of Den mark, who explored Vesuvius with them ; Amphodelite from a^p, double, and a&Ao.-, spear, the crystals being often twinned parallel to i-i ; Latrobite, after C. F. Latrobe, the discoverer of the variety. For recent observations on cryst., see Descl. Min., i. 294 ; Hessenb. Jlin. Not., No. L 6; \"Websky, ZS. G., xvi. 530 ; Kokscharof, Bull. Ac.

The analysis corresponds to the oxygen ratio 1:3-18:5-24. B.B. alone, fuses only on the edges to a vesicular glass. Gelatinizes easily on heating with muriatic acid. The mineral is probably identical with anorthite. Optical characters separate it from scapolite. Occurs in boulders in the auriferous sand of Barsovskoi, as the gangue of the blue corundum, as indian ite is the gangue of the corundum of the Carnatic. 310C. Bytownite Thomson, Min., i. 372, 1836.

Pyr., etc \u2014 B.B. fuses at 3 to a colorless glass. Decomposed with difficulty by muriatic acid, generally leaving a portion of undecomposed mineral. Obs \u2014 Labradorite is a constituent of some rocks. (1) Tho cleavable mineral, along with hornblende, composes a granite-like variety of diabase, or a rock resembling dioryte, but having labradorite as the feldspar. (2) If the hornblendic constituent is a dark lamellar variety of either hornblende or pyroxene, or the species hypersthene, the rock is called hyperyte (or hyper sthenyte). (3) If the hornblendic mineral is a light lamellar pyroxene (diallage), the rock is called gabbro. (4) If the hornblende and labradorite constitute a homogeneous fine-grained compact mass, the rock is called amphibolyte or diabase; and (5) if the diabase contains distinct crystals of porphyry, it is a diabase porphyry, the green porphyry or oriental verd-antique of Greece (anal. 25) being of this nature. (6) The crypto-crystalline, or felsite variety of labradorite, occurring occasionally in connection with some of these rocks, has been called incorrectly saussurite and jade or nephrite. The above are labradoric metamorphic rocks. There are also the following labradoric intrusive rocks. (7) Doleryte, consisting of labradorite and pyroxene, with generally some magnetite \u2014 a rock which, on the one hand, may be light-col ored crystalline or granitoid, and on the other, dark-colored compact massive, either porphyrito or not, sometimes crypto-crystalline, and also a cellular lava ; it includes much of the so-called trap, greenstone, and amygdaloid. (8) Basalt, similar to doleryte in structure, colors, and varieties, but containing, in addition to labradorite and pyroxene, chrysolite in disseminated grains. Dole rytic and basaltic lavas are the most common of volcanic rocks, (u) Labradorite also occurs in other kinds of lava, and is sometimes found in them in glassy crystals, as in those of Etna and Vesuvius. The labradoric metamorphic rocks are most common among the formations of the Azoic or pre- Silurian era. Such are part of those of British America, northern New York, Pennsylvania, Arkansas ; those of Greenland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and probably of the Vosges. Being a feldspar containing comparatively little silica, it occurs mainly in rocks which include little or no quartz (free silica). JIany foreign localities are mentioned above. Ou the coast of Labrador, labradorite is associated with hornblendo, hypersthene, and magnet ite. It is met with in place at Jlille Isles, Chateau Richer, Rawdon, Morin, Abercrombie, and elsewhere, in Canada East ; and in boulders at Drummond and elsewhere, Canada West. It occurs abundantly at Essex Co., N. V. ; large boulders are met with in the towns of Jloriah, Newcomb, Jl'Intyre, Westport, and Lewis, N. Y. ; also occasionally in Orange, Lewis, St. Law rence, Warren, Scoharie, and Green Cos. In Pennsylvania, at Jlineral Hill, Chester Co., and op posite New Hope, Bucks Co. ; in the Witchita Mts., Arkansas. Silicile and mornite are from Antrim, Ireland. Labradorite was first brought from the Isle of Paul, on the coast of Labrador, by Jlr. Wolfe, a Moravian missionary, about the year 1770, aod was called by the early mineralogists Labrador stone (Labradorslein), and also chatoyant, opaline, or Labrador feldspar. Klaproth's analysis above (No. 1) was the first one made (in 1815). Labradorite receives a fine polish, and owing to the chatoyant reflections, the specimeus are often highly beautiful. It is sometimes used in jewelry. Alt. \u2014 Labradorite, like anorthite, appears to undergo alteration with considerable facility, it losing lime through infiltrating carbonated or alkaline waters, aud receiving water. In some cases, also, it has received considerable iron. The following analyses appear to be of specimens of this altered labradorite. The results are remarkable for either the small proportion of time or large proportion of iron, or the same of potash or of water, each of which may be regarded as an indication of alteration.

Its inferior hardness would indicate alteration. The albite from Pennsylvania, analyzed by Redtenbacher (anal. 19), is caUed oligoclase-aibiie by Scheerer; it gives the 0. ratio 1-1:8: 11'7. He applies the same name to the Snarum feldspar analyzed by Richter, which he says has the external form of seapolite, and G.=2'59; oxygen ratio 1:3:1 1-8. It is the olafite. That of Snarum, analyzed by Scheidtauer, was hi snow-white crystals, and gave 12 : 3 : ILS; it holds an excess of protoxyds, owing to the lime present, which may be a result of alteration. Felsite or compact feldspar has usually some free silica disseminated through it. The follow ing are analyses of some kinds, either albile-felsite or oligoclase-felsite. The presence of lime is in favor of the latter. Adinole is probably albitic : it is reddish, from Sala, Sweden. Amausite Ger hard has been considered as oligoclase in base ; the name was given to a granulite (Weissstein) of Namiest in Moravia.

Obs \u2014 Albite is a constituent of several rocks. With hornblende it constitutes dioryte or"], [408, "352 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. greenstone. It occurs with orthoclase in some granite, as in that of Pompey s Pillar, and in suet cases is usually distinguishable by its greater whiteness. It is common also in gneiss, and some times in the crystalline schists. Veins of albitic granite are often repositories of the rarer granite minerals and of fine crystallizations of gems, including beryl, tourmaline, allanite, columbite, etc. It occurs also in some trachyte, as that of Jlontagna, Island of Pantellaria; in phonolite, at Lan gas jail, Iceland; in granular limestone in disseminated crystals, as near Jlodane in Savoy. In the compact condition, felsite, it constitutes the base of albite porphyry, a rock sometimes red (as at Agay) with scattered whitish crystals of albite ; also the same of some spilyte, as at Frejus, a compact grayish rock, containing globules of carbonate of lime, the base ot* which, ac cording to Diday, is 70 p. c. albite ; also of some granulyte or weissstein (white stone). Many localities of albite are mentioned above. It occurs with epidote and garnet at Arendal; with eudialyte and hornblende in Greenland. In the United States, in Maine, at Paris, with red and blue tourmalines. In Mass., at Chester field, with the same minerals, in lamellar masses (cleavelandite), slightly bluish, also fine granular, and rarely in small crystals ; at Goshen. In New Hamp., at Acworth and Alstead. In Conn., at Haddam, with chrysoberyl, beryl, columbite, and black tourmaline ; at the Jliddletown feldspar quarry, in fine transparent or translucent crystals (fig. 305) ; at Monroe, a fine granular variety containing beryl. In N York, at Granville, Washington Co., white transparent crystals ; at Jloriah, Essex Co., of a greenish color, with smoky quartz, and resembling green diallage. In Penn., at Unionville, Delaware Co., a granular variety is the matrix of the corundum (see anals. 20 and 21), having the hardness of quartz (7 \u2014 7*25). It had been taken for indianite. A similar variety, equally hard, is found with idocrase at Sanford, Maine. In California, Calaveras Co., with native gold and auriferous pyrites. In Canada, in fine crystals, at the Suffield silver mine, near L. Massawippi, N.E. of L. Mem phremagog. The name Albite is derived from albus, white, in allusion to its color, and was given the species by Gahn and Berzelius in 1814. For recent observations on cryst., Descl.

The orthoclase of Carlsbad contains rubidium. The varieties depend mainly on structure, variations in angles, the presence of soda, and the presence of impurities. The amount of soda detected by analyses varies greatly, the ratio to the potash being from 1 : 100 to 1 : J. But recent chemical investigations have shown, what Breithaupt indicated from ocular examination in 1861, that some of the sodiferous varieties owe the soda to a crystalline combination of the orthoclase with albite. The perthite (see beyond) has thus been found to con sist of thin alternate layers of these two feldspars. How far this explanation extends to other sodiferous kinds remains to be ascertained. The variations in angles are large, and they occur sometimes even in specimens of the same locality. In crystals of the kind called chesterlite, which are to all appearance regular and undis torted, the angle /' (right prismatic plane) A /(left id.) varies from 121\u00b0 to 127\u00b0, according to the author's measurements ; and other angles make the form triclinic, 0 A I and O A I' sometimes differing 5\u00b0, one being 110\u00b0 and the other 115\u00b0; while twins compounded parallel to the clino diagonal section, which are common, prove, by the absence of any reentering angle on the base, that the form is not triclinic (although so made by Breithaupt, who refers the species (B. H. Ztg., xvii. 1 ) to albite). The crystallization is normally monoclinic, and the variations are simply irreg ularities. There are also large optical variations in orthoclase, on which see Descl. Jfin., i. 329. The variations in amount of soda and in angles have led Breithaupt to make several species out of the species orthoclase. But until it is proved that crystals of certain specific angles have uniformly the same specific chemical composition, and further, that kinds having the same specific chemical composition wherever occurring, always, when crystallized, present the same angles, such species cannot properly be recognized as distinct. The varieties that have been named are the following: Var. 1. Ordinary. In crystals, or cleavable massive, (a) Adularia. Transparent, cleavable, usually with pearly opalescent reflections, and sometimes with a play of colors like labradorite, though paler in shade. Moonstone (Hecatohte Delameth., T. T., ii. 201, fr. 'mutij, the moon) belongs in"], [411, "355 UNISILICATES. part here, the rest being albite and oligoclase. Valencianite, from the silver mine of Valenciana Mexico, is adularia. Breithaupt finds for ordinary orthoclase (which he calls pegmatolite) G.= 2*539\u20142*578 (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 38). Kokscharof obtained (Min.

(6) Sunstone, or aventurine feldspar (Heliolite Delameth., T. T., ii. 200). In part orthoclase; rest albite or oligoclase (q. v.). (c) Necronite. A cleavable feldspar, fetid in odor when struck. The original was found by Hayden near the York and Lancaster road, 21 m. from Baltimore, in granular limestone, and was whitish or bluish in color. Named from kkp6s, a corpse. (d) Amazonstone. Bright verdigris-green, and cleavable. (e) Erythrite. Flesh-red, from amygdaloid, near Kilpatrick. Made out by Thomson to contain 3 p. c. of magnesia. Named from ipvUp6s, red. (f) Sanidin of Nose, or glassy feldspar, including much of the Ice-spar, part of which is anorthite. Occurs in transparent glassy crystals, mostly tabular (whence the name from <j*pi\u00bbps, a board) in lava, pumice, trachyte, phonolite, eta Proportion of soda to potash varies from 1 : 20 to 2 : 1. A. Mitscherlich finds in some kinds 0-79 \u2014 2'33 p. c. of baryta. Rhyacolite is the same; the name was applied to glassy crystals from Mt Somma (Bisspath Wern.). Rose has since observed (Kryst. Ch. Min., 88) that the specimen he analyzed (Pogg., xxviii. 143) probably contained some mixed nephelite, and that tho mineral is orthoclase. Named from fnf, stream (lava stream), and XiOos, stone. (g) Chesterlite. In white crystals, smooth, but feebly lustrous, implanted on dolomite in Ches ter Co., Penn., and having the variations in it3 angles above stated. It contains but little soda. Twins occur with composition parallel to O, and also parallel to both O and i-i, the latter appar ent by tho meeting of stri\u00e6 along the middle of an O, and the former by the same on an i-i. Crystals vary from a line in breadth to IJ- in. G.=2-531 Silliman. Erni's analysis (This Jlin., 3d edit., 1850, b78) is erroneous, and therefore not cited here. (Ii) Microclin. Usually in cleavable masses, whitish, grayish, or reddish, and opalescent. The original was from the zircon-syenite of Fredericksvarn and Laurvig and Brevig, Norway. Brei thaupt made the angle between the two cleavage planes 90\u00b0 22' \u2014 90\u00b0 23', instead of 90\u00b0; and hence derived the name, from fiurpis, little, and \u00ab\\ivu>, I incline. The analysis (No. 55) gives for the ratio of Na to K 3 : 2. But Breithaupt has since referred to microclin the feldspar of Arendal, which afforded him the same angle, but yet contains but a trace of soda (No. 22). He also refers here a feldspar from Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland (anal. 54), which is near the first-mentioned in composition, and gave the angles O A i-i=90\u00b0 22', O A 7=112\u00b0 9', Oa7'=113\u00b0 10', O A 14= 129 34', i-i A 7' = 119\u00b0 13' 7a 7' = 119\u00b0 4', 7A i-*j = 121\u00b0 43' ; also the feldspar of tbe micaceous rock (called Miascyte) of Jliask (Urals), which has Na : K=l : 1, with an excess of silica, accord ing to an unsatisfactory analysis ; also a Bodenmais feldspar of gray and greenish colors, with G. =2-575\u20142-594, but he suggests that Kerndt's analysis (No. 56) was probably made on a mixture of microclin and oligoclase, the two occurring together ; while Potyka found that the green variety (anal. 25) contained little soda. Potyka also states that the actual form was triclinic, and that the cleavage face had the usual stri\u00e6 of triclinic feldspars; but Kenngott observes (Ueb., 1861, 73) that he did not find the stri\u00e6 on a Bodenmais specimen, and H. Fischer none on the feldspar of the zircon-syenite. Other loc. reported by him are : Lewis Co., N. Y., with black pyroxene; Baveno in Italy ; Lomnitz and Fischbach in Silesia, of red color ; Scholtzenberg and Kunersdorf, Silesia ; Olbern-hau in Silesia, grayish- white, G. = 2-593 ; Sforzella in Predazzo, white, G.=2*596 ; syenite of tho Plauen-Grund, near Dresden \u2014 an extension of its distribution which must make it easy to test the value of its distinctive characters. Notwithstanding the measurements of Breithaupt, microclin is probably monoclinic. Descloi zeaux, after optical investigations (Min., i. 341), refers it to orthoclase. It is to be observed that these angles were obtained from kinds having little soda as well as others having much. More over, loxoclase, in which the amount of soda is stdl larger, is monoclinic. (i) Loxoclase. In grayish-white or yellowish crystals, a little pearly or greasy in lustre, often large, feebly shining, lengthened usually in the direction of the clino liagonal. O A 7=112\u00b0 30', OA7' = 112\u00b050', 7a7' = 120\u00b020', O A i-i (cleavage angle)=90\u00b0, Breith. G.=2-6-2*62, Plattner. The analyses find much more soda than potash, the ratio being about 3:1, but how far this is due to mixture with albite has not been ascertained. From Hammond, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. Named from \\o(as, transverse, and *Xiiu, I cleave, under the idea that the crystals are peculiar in having cleavage parallel to the orthodiagonal section. (j) Breithaupt has added still other names. His Paradoxite, from tin mines near Marienberg, etc^ has (1. c.) 7a7'=119\u00b0 0' ; 7a i-i = 120\u00b0 40', /A i-i = 120\u00b0 20'; H.=54p-6; G.=2*440-2455; color flesh-red. Contains potash as the alkali, with little or no soda, (k) His Cottaite is the"], [412, "356 OXYGEN COSIPOUNDS. grayish- white orthoclase in twins from granite in Carlsbad, Bohemia, circle of Elbogen ; bj his trials it has G.=2*6091\u2014 2*6098, H.=6\u2014 64, and 7a7 about 120\u00b0; and by R\u0153ssler's analysis (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 39) it contains 8 p. c. of soda to 5 of potash. But Redner and Bulk have found (anal. 14, 1 5) that it is an ordinary potash-feldspar with over 14 p. c. of potash, and has G.=2*55 \u20142-573. (I) His Muldan is from Mulda near Freiberg; it is stated to have I A i-i =111\", 7' A i-i = 116\u00b0, 0A7=116\u00b0 \u2014 1164/*, Oa7'=117\u00b0; G.=2-54-2-56. Moll's analysis (No. 12) shows that it is common orthoclase, although irregular in its angles. (to) Lazurfeldspar (Lasurfeldspath), a feldspar having H. = 6, and G. = 2*597, and the cleavage of orthoclase, found near Lake Baikal with lapis lazuli. (n) Perthite. A flesh-red aventurine feldspar, consisting of interlaminated albite and ortho clase, as shown beyond. From Perth, Canada East. (o) Murchisonite is similar flesh-red feldspar to perthite, with gold-yellow reflections in one di rection, like sunstone ; and stated to have also an unusual cleavage direction besides the two ob served. From Dawlish and Exeter, England. Named after its discoverer, JIurchison the geologist. Weissigite, of .Tenzsch, is in small whitish or reddish-white twin crystals, and is from the cavi ties of amygdaloid at Weissig near Dresden; G.=2*538\u2014 2-546. I. Lea has named (Proc. Ac. Philad., Jlay, 1866) a greenish orthoclase from Lenni, Delaware Co., Pa., \"almost without cleav age,\" lennilite ; other specimens of the same locality, pearly aud distinctly cleavahle, delawarite ; and a dull bluish-green subtrausparent kind, of an aventurine character, containing minute parti cles bright and hexagonal (hematite?) from Blue Hill, 2 m. N. of Jledia, Pa., cassinite. These are announced only as varieties of orthoclase ; but their distinctive characters are not such as to entitle them to special names. There is no place in the science of Mineralogy for names so given. 2. Compact Orthoclase or Okthoclase-felsite. This crypto-crystalline variety is common and occurs of various colors, from white and brown to deep red. There are two kinds (a) the jasper-like, with a subvitreous lustre ; and (b) the ceraloid or wax-like, with a waxy lustre. Some red kinds look closely like red jasper, but are easily distinguished by the fusibility. The orthoclase differs from the albite felsite in containing much more potash than soda. Leelite, named after J. F. Lee, is a deep, flesh-red variety, of waxy lustre, from Gryphyttan, Sweden. The Swedish name Hdlleflinta means false flint. A. Proportion of soda much less than that of potash; from -/\\j and less to J. Analyses: 1, VaL Rose (Scheerer's J., viii. 244); 3, Diirre (Ramm. Min. Ch., 623); 3, S.

Phillips, in an imperfect analysis of murchisonite (Phil. Mag. & Ann., i. 448), obtained Si 686, Si 166, fl 14-8. The mineral came from Dawlish, and is evidently orthoclase. The perihite afforded Gerhard (ZS. G., xiv. 151) the same composition as obtained by Hunt, viz.: Si 65-83, Si 1845, Pe L72, Ca lr., Na 5-06, K 8-54, ign. 0-32=99-92. But he found, fur ther, that it was divisible into thin reddish and whitish layers, which were respectively orthoclase and albite. These layers afforded him (1. c.) : Si Si Pe Ca Na fl 1.

The O. ratio in No. 1 is 0-94 : 3 : 1249; in No. 2, 0-96 : 3 : 12-09. An orthoclase, monocUnic in crystals and cleavage, fr. the nephelin-doleryte of Vogelsgebirge. afforded A. Knop (Jahrb.

The mineral is remarkable for the small amount of sUica, large of alumina, and the presence of baryta The peculiar constitution may be a result of partial alteration, or of crystaUinic mixture ; which is true is not ascertained.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. fuses at 5 ; varieties containing much soda are more fusible. Loxoclase fuses at 4. Not acted upon by acids. Obs. \u2014 Orthoclase is an essential constituent of many rocks. 1, Granular crystalline. Granite and gneiss, which consist of orthoclase, quartz, and mica. Mica schist, the same with less orthoclase and more mica. Syenite and syenitic gneiss, like the preceding, but containing hornblende in place of mica. Granulyte, a mixture of granular ortho clase and more or less quartz. Albilic granite, a granite containing albite as well as orthoclase. A similar rock contains oligoclase in place of albite. Pyroxenyte, a rock consisting of orthoclase and pyroxene. Miascyte, a granular slaty rock consisting of orthoclase and el\u00e6olite, from Jliask in the Ural. These rocks contain the orthoclase in cleavable grains, and sometimes also in dis tinct disseminated crystals ; when the latter is the case the rock is said to be porphyritic. Tbe finest and largest crystals of orthoclase occur in granitic or feldspathic veins. 2. Compact cryptocrystalline. Orthoclase-/eteife, or leelite, already described. It sometimes con tains quartz in disseminated grains ; and Diirocher has observed cases in which a felsite graduated into a granite or granulyte. As the rock was originally a clayey rock (derived from the wear (not the decomposition) of the minerals of granitic rocks) it is natural that there should be the tran sition here mentioned. The feldspar in some of the analyses below may be partly of oligoclase or albite. The hiilleflinta of Sweden is for the most part here included. As the granular orthoclase rocks, granite, gneiss, and the like, graduate into others con taining horublende, such as syenite, syenitic gneiss, etc., so the compact orthoclase-felsites may graduate into others that are hornblendic, though not visibly so ; \u2014 and these last will indicate their hornblendic composition, not merely by their composition as ascertained by chemical analy sis, but also by their high specific gravity. The spherules of variolyte of a white, grayish, or greenish-white color, are mostly a compact feldspar or felsite of some kind. Porphyry, in part, consisting of a felsite base with disseminated opaque crystals of orthoclase ; but this felsite base is seldom pure orthoclase. In the green antique porphyry, it is an intimate mixture of orthoclase and hornblende. [The feldspar is oligoclase or albite in some porphyry.] Phonolyte (or clinkstone), a compact grayish rock, often containing crystals of glassy feldspar. and having a zeolite in the base along with orthoclase. [In some phonolite the feldspar is oligoclase.] Trachyte, a grayish igneous rock of rough fracture, intermediate between phonolite and a gran ular crystalline rock, it owing its roughuess of surface largely to the grains of glassy feldspar which mainly constitute it. Argillyte and talcose schist generally contain, more or less of orthoclase in a cryptocrystalline or un distiuguisliable state. Often, however, as analyses show, the alkalies are mostly wanting ; and when so, the amount of feldspar is small ; and it may be wholly absent. 3. Amorphous. Obsidian or volcanic glass is sometimes an impure orthoclase in a glassy state ; and in other eases it is a mixture of orthoclase or labradorite aud augite with chrysolite and much iron, the materials varying with the lavas of a volcano ; for any lava will become glassy, and thus make obsidian, by rapid cooling. G. = 2*25 \u2014 2*8. Pitchstone has the lustre of pitch rather than glass ; pearlstone has a pearly lustre, and is some times in spherules (splierulite), or consists of spheroidal concretions. G. = 2-3 \u2014 24. The spher ules of pyromeride, porphyry, etc., are quite similar, though usually having an excess of silica from mixed quartz. Pitchstone and pearlstone are sometimes in composition albite or oligoclase rocks rather than orthoclase, that is, contain soda, or soda and lime, instead of potash. See analyses below. Fuchs has suggested that these rocks derive their glassy portion from solidified water-glass and not from the fusion of a feldspar. Krablite Forchhammer, or Baulite, appears to be a siliceous feldspathic mineral related to these concretions. It forms the basis of the trachyte, obsidian, and pitchstone of Iceland. According to von Walterhausen, it occurs also in triclinic crystals ; and he deduces the oxygen ratio 1:3: 24=(R + il) gi'*-*. B.B. fuses only in thin splinters; in acids insoluble. H=6.

Alt. \u2014 Feldspar may be altered through infiltrating waters carrying more or less carbonic acid in solution (Forchhammer, Fournet, Bisehof) ; also through the action of waters rendered acid by the decomposition of sulphids (Jlitscherlich); also by ordinary waters holding traces of alkaline and other ingredients iu solution (Bisehof). The presence of a sulphid of iron, or a mineral containing protoxyd of iron, as some mica, garnet, etc., is often the first occasion of the change. The decomposition of the mineral with the attendant oxydation of the iron distributes ferruginous waters through the rock (or sulphate of iron from the altered sulphid), and thus, by a disaggregating or decomposing action, prepares the way for other agencies.

The change thus going on ends in forming kaolin or some other hydrous silicate. The carbonata of soda or potasli, or the silicate of these bases, set free, may go to the formation of other minerals \u2014the production of pseudomorphic or metamorphic changes \u2014 and the supplying fresh and marine waters with their saline ingredients. Kaolin is generaUy a simple hydrous silicate of alumina (see Kaolinitb), expressed by the formula Si Si'-1 + 2 fl=Silica 46-3, alumina S9'8, water 13'9. Orthoclase in changing to it loses 1 K + Si. Part of the sUica set free may go off with more or less of the potash, or may form opal, quartz, siliceous sinter. Tho alumina also is often in part removed. The same explanation is readUy apphed to tho change in albite or other feldspars. When the change is not carried on to the exclusion of the protoxyd bases, certain zeoUtes may result, especiaUy, as Bischof states, when labradorite is the feldspar undergoing alteration, which species he describes as giving origin to the species mesolite. Massivo nepheline or el\u00e6olite is a still more common source of zeolites. Anal. 52, by Scheerer, is of orthoclase enveloping the zeolite bergmannite, and 53, of tbe same enclosed in bergmannite, this zeolite having apparently been formed out of other portions of the orthoclase. When tho waters contain traces of a magnesian salt \u2014 a bicarbonate or silicate\u2014 tho magnesia may replace the lime or soda, and so lead to a steatitic change, or to a talc when the alumina is excluded ; and when augite or hornblende is present, it may give origin to chlorite. The action of sulphurous acid from volcanic fumaroles pioduces often a complete destruction of the feldspar and other minerals present, giving rise to deposits or incrustations of silica, in some of its various forms, and also hall oy site, kaolin, etc. Steatite, talc, chlorite, kaoUo, Uthomarge, mica, laumontite, occur as pseudomorphs after ortho clase or albite ; and tin ore and calcite often replace these feldspars by some process of solution and substitution. Labradorite more rarely forms kaolin. Orthoclase is also described as occurring altered to albite. This has been mentioned as an example of paramorphism, the two species being dimorphous. But as these feldspars occur together in the same rock, and must have been formed under very simUar circumstances, we can hardly suppose that either is liable to a change like that of a dimorphous compound to the form of the other.

A labradorite without alkali and with the angles of orthoclase is so much of an anomaly as to be at least of very im probable existence. It may well be altered orthoclase and thereby pseudomorphous. Nordenskiold, while making the form monoclinic in the text, states that ho obtained the angle 90\u00b0 22' between the two cleavages with a reflective goniometer, and suggests that the form may possibly be tri clinic. Still the other angles are so closely those of orthoclase that tliis view appears quite im probable, as he also must regard it, since he does not adopt it in the toxt. It was called anhydrous scolecite by N. Nordenskiold, because the O. ratio was that of scolecite minus the water."], [418, "362 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. ni. SUBSILICATES. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SPECIES. A.

It is found near Abo, in the parisii of Para is in Finland, and at Aker and Gulsjo in Sweden ; at Taberg in Wermland; at Boden in Saxony; on Loch Ness in Scotland; at Achmatovsk in the Ural, along with perofskite; and in the mines of Schischimsk with red apatite. Humite occurs at Somma, in ejected masses of a kind of granitic rock, along with forsterite, biotite, pyroxene, magnetite, etc. Abundant in the counties of Sussex, N. J., and Orange, N. Y., where it is associated with spinel, and occasionally with pyroxene and corundum. In N. Jersey, at Bryam, orange and straw colored chondrodite, and also a variety nearly black, occurs with spinel ; at Sparta, a fine local ity of honey-yellow chondrodite ; a mile to the north of Sparta the best locality of this mineral in N. J. ; at Vernon, Loekwood, and Franklin. In N. York, in Orange Co., iu Warwick, Monroe, Cornwall, near Greenwood Furnace, and at Two Ponds, and elsewhere ; near Edenville in fine specimens on the land of Mr. Houston; also sparingly in Rossie, on the bank of Laidlaw Lake. In Mass., at Chelmsford, ivith scapolite. In Penn., near Chaddsford, in Harvy's quarry, of yellow and orange colors, abundant. In Canada, in limestone at St. Crosby, St. Jerome, St. idele, Grenville, etc., abundant. The name chondrodite is from x\u00b0\"ti-\u00b0s, a grain, alluding to the granular structure. Brucite was given by Col. Gibbs after Dr. Bruce, editor of the American Mineralogical Journal ; Maclureile by Seybert, after Wm. Maclure. The mineral was first discovered in New Jersey by Dr. Bruce. Fluorine was first detected in it in 1811, by Dr. Langstaff of New York, whose analysis (No. 1) gives very nearly the correct constitution of the species. Cleaveland, in the first edition of his mineral ogy (issued in 1816), at p. 185, in a brief mention of the undescribed species, speaks of it as a fluale, calling it fluate of magnesia, he evidently having had an imperfect report of Dr. Langstaff 's examination, the results of which had not then been published. Dr. Torrey obtained similar results to those of Dr. Langstaff in 1818. See on these points Am. J. Sci., vi. 171, 1823. D'Ohs son analyzed the mineral in 1817 without finding the fluorine, he obtaining (I.e.) Si 38*00, Mg 64-00, Fe 5'10, i&l P50, K 0*86 Mn tr., a result very wide from tho true composition. Humite was shown to be identical with chondrodite in composition by Rammelsberg. On cryst. see Scacchi, Pogg., 1851, Erganz., iii. 161, who identified and described the three types of humite ; also Hessenberg, Min. Not., ii. 15 ; Nordenskiold on chondrodite of Pargas, Pogg. xevi. 118. The author adopts a modified view of Scacchi's types, first brought out in Am. J. Sei, II. xiv. 175.

TJlex's specimen (anal. 30) was procured from a cargo of copper ores landed at Hamburg, and identified as taltalite by its characters. Pyr., etc. \u2014 I., fuse rather easily to a white blebby glass or slag ; II., fuse with a strong heat to a blebby slag or enamel, either w-hite, greenish, or brownish ; III., fuse with difficulty, or, in some, only on the edges, to a brownish, brownish-red, gray, or black slag ; IV., fuse on the edges, and often with great difficulty, to a yellowish, grayish, bluish, or whitish slag or enamel, and some are infusible ; V., infusible, but becoming white or paler, sometimes, as the Paris (Me.) rubellite, affording a fine enamel on the edges (Ramm.). \"With the fluxes many varieties give reactions for iron and manganese. Fused with a mixture of bisulphate of potash and fluor-spar gives a strong reaction for boric acid. By heat alone tourmaline loses weight from the evolution of fluorid of silicon and perhaps also fluorid of boron ; and only after previous ignition is the mineral completely decom posed by fluohydrio acid. Not decomposed by acids (Ramm.). After fusion perfectly decomposed by sulphuric acid (v. Kobell). Ob3. \u2014 Tourmaline is usually found in granite, gneiss, syenite, mica, chloritic or talcose schist, dolomite, granular limestone, and sometimes in sandstone near dykes of igneous rocks. The vari ety in granular limestone or dolomite is commonly brown. Foreign localities are mentioned above. Small brilliant black crystals in decomposed feld spar, at Sonnenberg in the Harz, are called aphrizite. Rubellite and green tourmaline occur near Katherinenburg in Siberia ; pink crystals are found at Elba. Pale yellowish-brown crystals in talc at WiDdisch Kappell in Carinthia ; green at Airolo, Switzerland ; white specimens (achroite) come from St. Gothard, Siberia, and Elba. A specimen, formerly in the Grand Duke's collection at Florence, measuring 11 inches square, contains 4 erect green tourmalines and 1 prostrate, 2, 4, and 2 J inches long, and f to 1 inch thick.

The name turmalin, from Turamali in Cingalese, was introduced into Holland in 1703, with a lot of gems from Ceylon. The property of attracting the ashes of burnt peat, after friction, led to its being very soon named in Holland Aschentrecker, or ash-drawer. In 1717, Lemery, in his Memoir in the Hist, de l'Acad. des Sci., France, referred the attraction to magnetism ; and io 1756 to 1762, appeared the several Memoirs of \u00c6pinus (published in the Mem. Acad. Berlin, vol. xii., and at St. Petersburg) on the electrical properties of tourmaline. The name tourmaline was slow of introduction into mineralogical treatises. The first specimens from Ceylon were cut gems, so that the common characteristics of tourmaline and schorl were not apparent. Linn\u00e6us, in his Syst. Nat., 176S, suggests the relation between them, but de Lisle was the first to describe Cey lon crystals, and bring the two minerals into one species. On the name scliorl, see pages 204 to 206. Long after the union of tourmaline and schorl, the species continued to bear the latter of these names; and even iu 1816, Jameson, in his System of Mineralogy, retains schorl as the name of the species, with common schorl and tourmaline or precious schorl as two subspecies. Alt. \u2014 Tourmaline occurs altered to mica, chlorite, cookeite, steatite. The mica is lepidolite, a species which is related in composition to some tourmaline, and is a frequent associate of the red and green varieties. It appears to take place through the addition of alkalies. Some rubellites and green tourmalines at Chesterfield are hollow, evidently from decomposition and removal of the interior ; and in the cavities are occasionally observed small crystals of yellow uranite (Tesche macher).

Phil., iv. 299, 1814) was found in 1814 in acicular interwoven crystals at Huel Unity, Cornwall ; color brown, slightly greenish in some lights ; G. =3-051 ; _H.=4*25 ; prisms stated to be flat rectangular. Thomson's analysis afforded Si 33*48, Si 31*85, Fe 2601, 0a 246, H 5*28=99-07. B.B. becomes scoriaceous at the edges. Loses over 5 p. e. when heated in a glass tube. Greg supposes that this loss may have been of boric acid instead of water, and that the mineral is a ferriferous tourmaline (Phil. Mag., IV. x. 118). 321. GEHLENITE. Gehlenit Fuchs, Schw.

Cyanite, when blue and transparent, and in sufficiently large pieces, is employed as a gem, and somewhat resembles sapphire. Named from kvhv6i, blue. The name sappare arose from a mistake by Saussure, Jr., in reading a label of thi3 mineral on which it was called sapphire ; a copy of this label is given in J. de Phys., xxxiv. 213 ; the specimen thus labelled was from Botriphinie in Scotland, and was sent by the Duke of Gordon to Saussure the father. Disthene is from Hi, twice, or of two kinds, and Mvos, strong, alluding to the unequal hardness and electric properties in two different directions. Von Kobell has shown (Ber. Ak. Miinchen, 1867) that the right and left-handed twins may be easily distinguished by means of polarized light ; they give, with the stauroscope, a cross some what oblique in position ; but the principal optical section does not revolve with the revolution of the crystal ; while the colors change in different order with tho revolution, according as the twin is right-handed or left-handed.

In recent experiments made uuder Rammelsberg's direction, tbe Finbo mineral lost in a porcelain oven 22-98 p. c; Schneckenstein 2073; Schlackenwald 17-73 \u2014 16-23; Trum buU 16-27 \u2014 19-55; BrazU 15-40\u201414-29; Altenberg pycnite 1998. The topaz was not fused in the heating, yet somewhat blistered at surface. The Brazil topaz afforded Rammelsberg after the heating in which 154 p. c were lost, Si 30-22, Si 71-34, F L56=10342; and after that hi whicb the loss was 14-29 p. c, Si 30-10, Si 7038, F 247 = 102-95, showing that the part lost was not strictly fluorid of silicon, but may have included some fluorid of aluminum. G Siadeler (1. c.) has shown that part ofthe fluorine escapes as fluohydric acid, and makes 89'9 p. c. of the loss to be fluorine. This gives for the TrumbuU topaz (anal. 5), 21-16 F; the Brazil. 20-71 F; the Finbo, 22\"29, from Forchhammer's results, and 20 66 from Rammelsberg's ; for the Saxon, 18-64 from Rammelsberg's trials, and 20-68 from DeviUe's ; the mean of the whole 20-68.

Obs. \u2014 Topaz occurs in gneiss or granite, with tourmaUne, mica, and beryl, occasionaUy with apatite, fluor spar, and tin ore ; also in talcose rock, as in Brazil, with euclase, etc., or in mica slate. With quartz, tourmaline, and lithomarge, it forms the topaz rock of Werner (topazoseme of Haiiy). Specimens of quartz crystal from Brazil, penetrated by topaz, are not uncommon. Minuto crystals of three or four different kinds, and two or three kinds of Uquids, have been detected by Sir David Brewster in crystals of topaz. (Edinb. Trans., x., and Am. J. Sci., xii. 214; and later, Edinb. new Phil J., II. xvi. 130, Proc. R. Soc. Edinb., iv. 548, v. 95.) See under Or ganic Compounds. Fine topazes come from the Urals, near Katharinenburg, and Miask ; in Nertschinsk, beyond L.

Topaz occurs also in the Mercado Mtn., in Durango, Mexico, along with tin ore and magnetite; at La Paz, province of Guanaxuato. Pycnite is from the tin mine of Altenberg in Saxony ; also those of Schlackenwald, Zinnwald in Bohemia, and Kongsberg in Norway. In the United States, in Conn., at Trumbull, with fluor asd diaspore ; at Middletown rare ; at Willimantie, with columbite. In N. Car., at Crowder's Mountain. In Utah, near 39\u00b0 40' N. and 1134;\u00b0 W., W. of S. of Salt Lake, in Thomas's Mts., on Capt. Simson's return trail. At Trumbull the crystals are abundant, but are seldom transparent, except those of small size ; these are usually white, or with a tinge of green or yellow. The large coarse crystals are sometimes six or seven inches in diameter. A variety of topaz from Brazil, when heated, assumes a pink or red hue, resembling tho Balas ruby. The finest crystals are brought from Minas Novas in Brazil. From their peculiar limpid ity, topaz pebbles are sometimes denominated goutles d'eau. The coarse varieties of topaz may be employed as a substitute for emery. On the cryst. of topaz, see Kokscharof, Min. Russi, ii. 198, 344, iii. 195, 378; Hessenberg, Min Not, No. vii. 38. The name topaz is from j-otoIioc, an island in the Red Sea, as stated by Pliny. But the topaz of Pliny was not the true topaz, as it \" yielded to the file.\" Topas was included by Pliny and earlier writers, as well as by many later, under the name chrysolite. Alt. \u2014 Topaz is found altered both to steatite, and kaolin or lithomarge. 326. EUCLASE. Haiiy; Delameth., J. de Phys., xli. 155, 1792 (without credit lo Haiiy) ; T.

Tho crystallization of this species is elaborately detailed by Schabus in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Vienna, vol. vi., and by Kokscharof in Pogg., ciii. 348, and his Russian Min eralogy. Euclase receives a high polish, but is useless as an ornamental stone on account of Us brittle ness. Named by Haiiy from c5, easily, and kX.Icjj, to break. Haiiy states that his name, Euclase, was published by Daubenton in an early issue of his Tableau meth. de Mineraux ; but the particular edition of the Tableau (of which several were issued) the author has not been able to learn. De lametherie, after publishing, in 1792, the name and description, without crediting either to Haiiy, in his Theorie de la Terre. in 1797, gives Haiiy full credit. First brought to Europe from S.

In N. Jersey, at Franklin, of a honey-yellow color. In Penn., Bucks Co., three miles west of Attleboro', associated with tabular spar and graphite. The crystallization was first clearly made out by G. Rose in 1821. For recent observations see R. & M. Min. ; Descl. Min. ; Hessenberg Min. Not., Nos. i. to vii ; v. Rath., Pogg., cxv. 466. Breithaupt states that much sphene is triclinic (Handb., ii. 744, B. H. Ztg., xxv. 107). Fig. 370 above is ideal, being intended to exhibit the relative positions of the planes on the fundamental prism, and the letters used on the planes by authors, as well as the symbols. Fig. 368 is from Naumann, drawn after his view of the fundamental form ; and fig. 373 (from Hessenberg) is simi lar in this respect, but a side view. Alt. \u2014 Sphene occurs of little hardness, dull in lustre, and hydrated from alteration. Crystals of this kind, found in a decomposing feldspar, with zircon at Green River, Henderson Co., N.

Gkothite Dana. (Titanite P. Groth, Jahrb. Min., 1806, 44.) P. Groth has shown that the ti tanite-like mineral, from tho syenite of Plauen Grand near Dresden, differs in composition and cleavage Irom ordinary sphene. The form is monoclinic in habit, being somewhat like f. 363 and 367 ; but there is distinct cleavage parallel to one 2, and little distinct parallel to the other. The angles are 2 A 2 = 136\u00b0; 2 on l-i=155\u00b0 19' to 156\u00b0 20'; 1-i on i-i about 162\u00b0. H.=6*5. G.= 3*52 \u2014 3*60. Lustre vitreous to greasy. Color clove to blackish-brown ; in thin splinters reddish brown and translucent. The altered mineral is isabella-yellow to pale yellowish-brown. Composition according to Groth (1. a): (f) Si 30*51, ti 3146, \u00a5e 5*83, Al, Y 2*44, Mn D02, Ca 31*34=102-30. It gives the O. ratio forfi, fi, Ti, Si, 8*95 : 3*23 : 12*16 : 16-15, or for bases (ti included) to silica, 24*34 : 1645=3:2. The generd- formula is therefore (R3, Rt, fi) Si. Theanaly sis corresponds very nearly to 8 Si, 6 ti, 1 fi, 9 (Ca Mn). It is therefore a titanite in which one-half of the bases consists of 3 Ca3-*- 1 (Pe, Al). If not a result of alteration, and the char acter of the cleavage is a constant one, it should rank as a distinct species. Castellite. Castellit Breith., B. H. Ztg., xxv. 113, 1866. Monoclinic.

Hermann showed that the mineral contained thoria, and that Rose had included it in his titanic acid and oxyd of cerium; his O. ratio for R (including the thoria), ti, Si is 1044 : 6-38 : 10'92= 15 : 9 : flG, and hence for R + ft, Si, 3 : 2, whence the above formula. Rose's analysis corresponds to the same general formula. a. The Coromandel mineral, referred here by Damour, affords, according to him, the 0. ratio foi R + fi + R, Si=2 : 1 ; and for R, fi, R=2 : 1 : 2 ; whence the formula (| R3+| fi+l R?)4 Si3. The alumina is left out of consideration as an impurity. But including it, the O. ratio for bases and silica is 20-65 to 10*14, sustaining still better the ratio 2 : 1. Damour has made a new examination of the mineral, and directly ascertained the absence of thorium (letter to the author of April 24, 1867); he further observes that a little Di and La are probably present with the Ce. Descloizeaux states that the mineral is not homogeneous, it consisting of a brown material not acting on polarized light, and small colorless grains which are strongly doubly refracting. The mineral has H.=5-5\u2014 6; G.=4-26; lustre vitreous, inclining to resinous ; color brownish-black ; subtranslucent. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. glows, then intumesces strongly, becomes brown, and fuses to a black glass Gives with the fluxes reactions for iron, manganese, and titanic acid. Gelatinizes with muriatic acid. The Coromandel mineral in a closed tube yields a little water. B.B. fuses with intumes cence to a black scoria, feebly magnetic. With salt of phosphorus it gives in R.F. a pale brown glass, opaline, which becomes milky in the O.F. With borax it affords a hyacinth-brown glass, transparent in the R.F. and pale brown and opaque in the O.F. Attacked readily by nitric acid, especially if heated, depositing gelatinous silica mixed with titanic acid and black grains of titanic iron. Obs. \u2014 From the Ilmen Mountains in the Urals ; only a few specimens have been found. The tseheffkinite in collections is mostly uralorthite, which it much resembles. Also from the coast of Coromandel, whence it was long since brought by Leschenault. Named after the Russian general, Tschevkin. 333. STAUROLITE.

Tho early analysts made the iron all sesquioxyd. Mitscherlich has pronounced it (J. pr. Ch., lxxxvi. 1 ) all protoxyd in the staurolite of St. Gothard, Airolo, and Brittany. Rammelsberg found a variety of ratios in his analyses of the mineral from other localities, the silica varying from 27 to over 50 per cent. But G. Lechartier has ascertained that staurolite contains, uniformly, some water, separable only at a high heat ; and that the variations are due to impurities, the powder under the microscope being distinctly a mixture of two or more minerals, and the action of fluo kydric acid on some crystals making them cellular, or even spongy and fragile.

Includes all Hydrous Silicates, excepting the Zeolites and the Margarophyllites. 1. Bisilicates. 2. Unisilicates. 3. Subsilicates. II. Zeolite Section. Feldspar-like in constituents and oxygen ratio ; the bases being alumina, and the alkalies and alkaline earths (K, JNsa, Ca, Ba, Sr), to the almost total exclusion of magnesia and iron ; and the oxygen ratio between the protoxyd and sesquioxyd bases being 1 : 3. III. Maegaeophyllite Section. Micaceous or thin foliated when crys tallized ; and plane angle of base of prism 120\u00b0. On account of the uncertainties with respect to the relations of the water in hydrous silicates, the basis for a true classification of them is to a large extent wanting. From the dominanco among anhydrous silicates of the grand subdivisions of Bisilicates, Unisilicates, and Subsilicates, the same groups might be reasonably looked for among the hydrous. But the formulas of very many of the species may be written according to either of these types, by making more, or less, or none, of the water basic ; and consequently all attempts to define the limits of the groups must be at present unsatisfactory. Crystallographic and other relations to anhydrous species give help, but not always sure guidance. The following examples elucidate some of the reasons for referring species to the section of Bisilicates rather than that of Unisilicates, or the reverse : Laumontite (No. 342, beyond) has a close approximation in crystalline form to pyroxene, and this suggests a relation to the Bisilicates ; moreover, its formula is wholly pyroxene-like, if tho water is not basic. It is to be noted that part of the water escapes on heating to 100\u00b0 C There is the same relation in form between pectolite and pyroxene, as long since shown by Frankenheim ; and tho same formula also, if the water, here a more stable constituent, is basic. Okenite is very near hornblende, or another anhydrous bisilicate, in its crystallization; aud it is also like it in formula, if half the water is basic. ' In each of these cases crystallography appears to show whether any of the water, and how much, is basic. Again, dioptase has the angles nearly, and the bisilicate ratio, of beryl, if the water be not basic. Prehnite has an affinity in its crystallization to chrysolite; and, if the water is all basic, the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica is 1 : 1, or that of a Unisilicate, as in chrysolite. Calamine is approximately isomorphous with prehnite, and, moreover, both are pyroelectric ; and the oxygen ratio is 1 : 1, if the water is not basic. Fahlunite, a result of the alteration of iolite, is equivalent to iolite plus water. Iolite is a j silicate, there being a deficiency of base for a true unisilicate; but the added water just sills up the deficiency, so that, if the water is basic, the species is strictly a Unisilicate, the 0. ratio for ft, fi, Si, fl being 1 : 3 : 5 : 1. or for the bases ft + fi-t-H and silica, 5 : 5=1 : l. There seems to be no reason for questioning this basic relation of the water; it is probable that the deficiency of base may lead to the easy absorption of water so characteristic of Iolite. In other alterations of iolite still more water is taken up, so that the 0. ratio is 1 : 3 : 5 : 2; the compound is apparently the same, but with twice the proportion of water, only one-half of ii in this case being basic. The same remarks are applicable to margarodite and other hydroua Micas in their relations to muscovite and the anhydrous micas."], [450, "394 OXYGEN compounds. Apophyllite crystallizes in tetragonal forms \u2014 forms that, are common among anhydrous Unisili oates, and are unknown among Bisilicates. The species is therefore arranged beyond as a TJni silicate, but as a representative of the Scapolite group of anhydrous silicates. Tritomite and ThoriU are isometric species, and related to helvite and garnet; and they are Unisilicates, like garnet, ii the water be not basic. From these examples it is apparent that the facts give only probable conclusions. It is to le hoped that chemistry will soon furnish principles that are encumbered with less of doubt. The group of Zeolites includes species that are feldspar-like in having among them the oxygeE ratios for the protoxyds, alumina, and silica 1:3:4, 1:3: 6, 1:3: 8, 1:3: 9, 1:3:1 2, with the only difference that water is present in addition. They are therefore sometimes spoken of as representatives among hydrous silicates of the anhydrous feldspars. But this inference, though apparently sustained by the oxygen ratios, is far from right. It assumes that the water is not basic. If it be basic, then the species may be ordinary Bisilicates or Unisilicates, quite remote from the feldspars. Looking to the crystallization, it is found that there is, in fact, nothing whatever to sus tain the relation to the feldspars. The species of the Feldspar group are almost identical in angles and physical characters ; while the zeolites are exceedingly diverse in both respects, and none have the feldspar form or angles. Nearly all the systems of crystallization are represented among them, and with a very wide range in angles. The feldspars have the prismatic angle near 120' ; while the zeolites that approach the feldspars most nearly \u2014 that is, the Stilbite group, in which the oxy gen ratio is 1 : 3 : 12, and the crystallization is in part oblique \u2014 have the prismatic angle near 90\u00b0 in one species, and from 130\u00b0 to 136\u00b0 in others. The hexagonal species, chabazite, levynite, and gmelinite, usually made a subgroup among the zeolites, have widely different rhombohedral angles. While, then, there is seeming unity in the group of zeolites, there is actually the widest diver sity; and, wheu fully understood, they w-ill probably have their places among the Unisilicates and Bisilicates of the first section. Analcite, which is included among the zeolites, is related in form to the feldspars, and in both form and formula (the water being excluded) to the anhydrous sili cate, leucite. The Margarophyllites appear to constitute a strictly natural group, although under a very vari ous chemical constitution. They are foliated in structure like the micas, and, like them, have the plane angle of the base of the prism 120\u00b0, the crystallization being either hexagonal or pris matic, with the angles of base 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. They include talc and pyrophyllite, margarodite and other hydrous micas, chlorite, margarite, etc.; with also kaolinite and serpentine, which have the same crystallization ; and to these are added some species not yet known in the crystallized state, which appear to be chemically allied to the margarophyllites. The true margarophyllites are below 5 in hardness ; greasy to the feel, at least when finely powdered ; and not sparry in appearance when massive, unless through pseudomorphism, in which case this sparry character is that of the original mineral altered to make them.

After the fl in the latter column, a fraction is added, giving the proportion of the water that is required to be added to the bases to make the ratio that of the formula.

The \u00c6delforsite of Retzius, or the Red Zeolite of \u00c6delfors, is referred here by N. J. Berlin, whc considers it impure from mixed silica (quartz), and related to the red zeolite of Upsala analyzed by him. It afforded Retzius Si 60-28, Al 15-42, Ca 8-18, Pe 4-16, Mg and Mn 0-42, fl 11*07=99*53. A similar mineral from Fahlun yielded Hisinger gi 60-00, Al 15\"6, Pe 1-8, Ca 8-0, fl 11-6=97-0; while he obtained for the \u00c6delfors zeolite Si 53*76, *Sl 18-47, Pe 4'02, Ca 10-90, fl 11-23=98-38, which is near the composition of laumontite. Bisehof has analyzed a pseudomorph of laumontite after orthoclase (see Orthoclase). Pyr., etc. \u2014 In a vacuum, Huelgoet laumontite crystals, according to Malaguti k Durocher, lose in weight 2*26 p. c, and, over sulphuric acid, 3*85 p. c. ; and regain the same in water or moist air. Heated up to 100\u00b0 C, they lose 3*17 p. c. ; to 200\u00b0, 6-08 p. c. ; to 300\u00b0, 7-28; and the remainder of the water only at a red heat. B.B. swells up and fuses at 2 7 \u2014 3 to a white enamel. Gelatinizes with muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 Laumontite occurs in the cavities of trap or amygdaloid ; also in porphyry and syenite, and occasionally in veins traversing clay slate with calcite. It was first observed in 1785, in the lead mines of Huelgoet in Brittany, by Gillet Laumont, after whom it is named. Its principal localities are at the Faroe Islands; Disko in Greenland; in Bohemia, at Eule in clay slate ; St. Gothard in Switzerland ; the Fassathal, in large masses exhibiting a radiated structure ; Sarnthal, near Botzen, Tyrol ; Plauenscher Grund, near Dresden ; Hartfield Moss in Renfrewshire, accompanying analcite; tho amygdaloidal rocks in the Kilpatriek hills, near Glasgow ; and in several trap rocks of the Hebrides, and the north of Ireland. Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, affords fine specimens of this species. It is there associated with apophyllite, thomsonite, and other species of this family ; also at Port George, N. S., in veins some times 3 in. thick, and at Margaretville, colored green by copper ; also at Digby Neck and Long Point. Also found in good specimens at Phipsburg, Maine ; also sparingly at Bradleysville, Litchfield Co., Conn., near a paper-mill, in narrow seams in gneiss; and at Southbury, Conn., a little east of the village, on the land of Mr. Stiles. Abundant in many places in the copper veins of Lake Superior in trap, and on I. Royale ; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac. Found also at Bergen Hill, N. J., in greenstone, with datolite, apophyllite, etc. ; sparingly at Phillipstown, N. T., in feldspar with stilbite, and at Columbia bridge, near Philadelphia. Alt. \u2014 Most varieties become opaque and crumble at the touch after exposure to the ordinary atmosphere, losing 1 to 2 p. c. of water. Specimens in cabinets can be best preserved from alter ation by keeping them in moist air. Schneiderite (1. c.) is laumontite from the serpentine of Monte Catini, Italy, which has unde -gone alteration through the action of magnesian solutions. It is described by Meneghini as lam aate radiate in structure, with H. = 3. Fig. 381 represents a crystal from Mt. Catini (one receiv d by Prof. G. J.

Breithaupt found for the angle R AR 125\u00b0 55'; and Kokscharof, after careful measurement, adopts this value (Bull. Ac. St. Pet,, ix. 240). Named by Haiiy dioptase, from pippi, through, and oirro/jai, io see, because the cleavage directions were distinguishable on looking through the crystal. Named Achirite after Achir Mahmed, a Bucharian merchant, living at the fortress of Semipa latna on the Irtish, who had procured it in the region where it occurred, and who furnished the specimens that were taken in 1785 by Mr. Bogdanof to St. Petersburg. Although first named by Hermann, his description was not given to the St. Petersburg Academy before 1800, and the volume containing it was not published until 1802, a year after the appearance of Haiiy's work. 346.

As the silica has been derived from the decomposition of other Silicates, it is natural that an excess should appear in many analyses.

But some analyses afford 1:2: 3=Cu Si+3 fl (anal. 13), and 1 : 2 : 4 = Cu Si+fl (anal. 11). Impure chrysocolla may contain, besides free silica, black oxyd of copper, oxyd of iron (or limonite), and oxyd of manganese ; and consequently vary in color from bluish-green to brown and black, the last especially when oxyd of manganese or of copper is present.

J., as described by Berthier (Ann. Ch. Phys., li. 395), is of three varieties: (1) a thin, green, transparent incrustration ; (2) a bluish-green earthy mineral, very tender and light, becoming transparent, like hydrophane, in water ; and (3) a pale greenish-bluu massive material, hard enough to scratch glass, and to be polished for jewelry ; and he observes that the chrysocolla is nearly pure in the first, but is mixed with opal-silica iu much of the second kind, and with opal-silica and ordinary silica in the last. Berthier's analysis (No. 4 above) was made on a specimen of the second kind, and according to him probably contained 8 p. c. of opal-silica in a state of mixture. Berthier, allowing for 8 p. c. of free silica in this analysis, sug gests that the composition may be Cu Si + 4 fl, while Bowen's earlier analysis (5) gives Cu Si-t 2 IL Berthier's mineral has been named (without sufficient reason) Somervillite, and the analysis has generally been taken as expressing directly his view of the composition. Berthier gives an analysis also of the hard chrysocolla of Somerville (third kind) to show that there is in these ores free silica. He obtaiued (1. c.)

Bisehof observes (Lehrb., ii. 1885) that silicate of copper may be formed through the action of an alkaline-, lime-, or magnesia-silicate on sulphate or nitrate of copper in solution. He also shows that this silicate is decomposed by carbonated waters, producing carbonate of copper. Tho alkaline silicates are furnished by the decomposing granite, and the sulphate of copper by altered pyritous copper. But L. S\u00e6mann communicates to the author that he has seen specimens of chryso colla from Chili, which have in the interior the fibrous structure and composition of pure mala chite, showing that the whole was once malachite. The chrysocolla analyzed by Scheerer (anaL 7 ) occurs with feldspar, and is supposed to have residted from the action of sulphate of copper on the feldspar. Some specimens of the chrysocolla are translucent and brittle on one part, aud earthy, like decomposed feldspar, on the opposite. Found in most copper mines in Cornwall ; at Libethen in Hungary; at Falkenstein and Schwatz n the Tyrol ; in Siberia ; the Bannat ; Thuringia ; Schneeberg, Saxony ; Kupferberg, Bavaria ; South Australia ; Chili, etc. In Somerville and Schuyler's mines, New Jersey, at Morgantown, Pa., and at Wolcottville, Conn., chrysocolla occurs associated with red copper ore, native copper, and green malachite ; in Pennsylvania, near Morgantown, Berks Co. ; at Perkiomen ; at Cornwall, Lebanon Co. ; also with similar associated minerals, and with brown iron ore, in Nova Scotia, at the Basin of Mines ; also in Wisconsin and Michigan, mixed with carbonate of copper. Chrysocolla is from ypuj-pis, gold, and itoMa, glue, and was the name of a material used in soldering gold. The name is often applied now to borax, which is so employed. But much of the aucient chrysocolla was a green stone containing copper as the coloring ingredient, and the best, as Dios corides says, was that which was kiitm-ous npnai^ovim, or of a fine leek-green or prase color; and the island of Cyprus, which was named from its copper mines, was a prominent locality. Pliny says the mineral was named after the real chrysocolla, because it looked like it. It may have in cluded carbonate of copper, as was true to some extent of the chrysocolla and mountain-green of tho 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The c\u00e6ruleum montanum of Wallerius included both chrysc 3olla and an earthy variety of the carbonate. 347. ALIPITE. Pimelit Schmidt, Pogg., lxi. 3S8, 1844. Alipit Glock., 1845.

Obs. \u2014 Calamine and smithsonite are usually found associated in veins or beds in stratified calcareous rocks accompanying ores of blende, iron, and lead, as at Aix la Chapelle ; Raibel and Bleiberg, iu Carinthia, in the upper Triassic ; Moresnet in Belgium, Fribourg in Brisgau, Iserlohn, Taruowitz, Olkucz, Miedzanagora, Retzbanya, Schemnitz. At Roughten Gill, in Cumberland, ir acicular crystala and mammillary crusts, sky-blue and fine green ; at Alston Moor, white ; at the Rutland mine, near Mattock, in Derbyshire, in brilliant crystals, and grayish-white, and yellow, and mammillated : at Castleton, in crystals ; on the Mendip Hills, mostly brownish-yellow, and in pari stalactitic ; in Flintshire, etc., Wales ; Leadhills, Scotland. Large crystals have been found at Nertschinsk. Iu tho United States occurs with smithsonite iu Jefferson county, Missouri In Pennsylvania, at the Perkiomen and Phenixville lead mines ; in a lower Silurian rock two miles from Bethle hem, at Friedensville, in Saucon valley, abundant and extensively worked ; on the Susquehanna, opposite Selinsgrove. Abundant in Virginia, at Austin's mines in Wythe Co. A pale yellow, fusible zinciferous clay occurs in considerable abundance with calamine at the Ueberroth mine, Friedensville. Analysis of this by John M. Blake gave Si 41*36, Al 8*04, Pe 9*55, 2n 32-24, Mg 1*02, K ir., fl 7-76. Other specimens examined by W. T. Roepper gave a variable amount of zinc, showing that tho substance is not homogeneous (priv. contrib.). On cryst. see G.

The name Calamine (with Galmei of the Germans) is commonly supposed to be a corruption of Cadmia. Agricola says it is from calamus, a reed, in allusion to the slender forms (stalactitic) com mon in the cadmia fornacum. The cadmia of Pliny and of other ancient authors included both the native silicate and carbon ate, and the oxyd from the chimneys of furnaces (cadmia fornacum). The two native ores con tinued to be coufounded under the name lapis calaminaris, calamine or galmei, until investi gated chemically by Smithson in 1803. Earlier analyses had made out chemical differences, and some authors, before 1790, had rightly suggested a division of the species : Bergmann having found 28 p. c. carbonic acid in a Holywell specimen (J. de Phys., xvi. 17, 1780) ; and Pelletier, in a kind from Fribourg in Brisgau, which had been called Zeolite of Brisgau because it gelatinized with acids, 52 p. c. silica, with 36 oxyd of zinc, and 12 water (J. de Phys., xx. 420, 1782) ; and Klaproth, in another, similarly gelatinizing, 66 oxyd of zinc and 33 silica. But Smithson was the first to make known the true composition, and clear away all doubts. De Lisle noticed the crystalline forms of the two species, describing one kind as prismatic with dihedral summits, and the other as scalenohedral like dogtooth spar, yet did not fully appreciate the importance of the observation ; while Hauy, 14 years later, iu his Traite, describes only tlie crys tals of the silicate, and takes the ground *,hat the zinc carbonatee was only an impure calcareous \"zinc oxyde.\" In 1 307 Brongniart called the silicate calamine, leaving for the other ore the chemical name zinc carbonatee. Iu 1832, Beudant followed Brongniart in the former name, and designated the latter Smithsonite, after Smithson*, who had analyzed in 1 803 the carbonate as well as silicate. Thus the two species were at last, not only distinguished, but mineralogically named. Unfortunately, Brooke & Miller, in 1852, reversed Beudant's use of these names, with no good reason ; aud in 1853, Kenngott, on account of the confusion of names, as he says, introduced for the silicate the new name Hemimorphite, and so added to the confusion. These innovations should have no favor. 361A. Moresnetite Risse (Verh. nat Ver. Bonn, 1865, Ber. 98). A mineral from Altenberg, near Aachen, occurring with calamine.

Appears to be a hydrous forsterite or boltonite in eompo- Ritioi., and to resemble much the latter. G. Rose pointed out the approximation in angle to chrysolite, and regarded it as an altered variety. Its occurrence in twins of three intersecting crystals, as made known by Descloizeaux (Min., 95, 1862), is an important characteristic not thus far observed in forsterite, or any other species ofthe chrysolite group. The crystals have the planes shiuing, but not quite even. Analyses: 1, 2, Dufrenoy (1. c, and Dufr. Min., 2d. ed., iv. 343); 3, Fellenberg (1. c.) : Si Fo Mn Mg Ca K fl 1.

The yellowish variety is the orangite (so called from the color), from Langesund fiord, which Bergemann, when he so named it, supposed to contain a new metal, called by him donarium. The latter has since been found with an exterior of the former. The mineral occurs as pseudomorphs after orthoclase and zircon, and crystals ofthe latter kind have afforded Zschau (Am. J. Sci., II. xxvi. 359) the angles yAl = 132J\u00b0, 1A1=123^\u00b0, the corresponding angles of zircon being 132\u00b0 10'andl23\u00b0 19'.

Hisinger and Berzelius, in 1803-4, detected in this mineral a new metal which they named cerium, after the planet Ceres, then recently announced ; and the mineral they called ceriie. Klaproth made tho same discovery about the same time, and gave the name ochroite to the mineral, ?nd ochroite earth to the new earth (alluding to its color, from axpos, brownish-yellow). In his Beitrage, 1807, Klaproth accepted the names of Hisinger and Berzelius, yet added a syllable (lest *,hey should appear to come from won, wax), making them cererium and cererite \u2014 a change not accepted. In 1839 Mosander proved that the oxyd of cerium contained the newmetal lanthanum, and in 1842 another new metal, didymium. 368. ERDMANNITE. Berlin, Pogg., Ixxxviil 162.

It is also found at Gin Cove, near Perry, Maine, with prehnite and analcite in amygdaloid ; at the Cliff mine, Lake .Superior region (f. 399). Apophyllite was so named by Haiiy in allusion to its tendency to exfoliate under the blowpipe, from and and f SAW, a leaf. Its whitish pearly aspect, resembling the eye of a fish after boiling, gave rise to the name Ichthyophlhalmile, from i^flus, fish, and iqBuXiids, eye. The name ichthyophlhalmile (or ichthyophthalme), given in 1800 by d'Andrada, has priority. But d'Andrada's description (1. c.) is bad in all respects, answering much better for pearly feldspar or adularia, even the specific gravity (2*491) being far out of the way ; it affords some evidence that he may have drawn it from another mineral. It was therefore hardly a violation of the strictest rule of priority that Haiiy, who had studied carefully the crystallization of the mineral before it was known to d'Andrada, should have named it anew. Neither justice to d'Andrada, nor the good of science, requires that the name apophyllite should now yield place to the earlier one. The ear liest analyses were made in 1805 by V. Rose (Gehlen's J., v.), and Fourcroy & Vauquelin (Ann. du Mus., v.). Alt. \u2014 Occurs altered to pectolite near Tiexno on Monte Baldo, along with unchanged crystals. Artif. \u2014 Crystals have been obtained by Wohler from heated waters, and he inferred that a tem perature of 180\u00b0 F. was necessary to the result. He stated that when heated in water to this temperature under a pressure of 10 to 12 atmospheres, it forms a solution which crystallizes on cooling. Pearly radiated crystals were formed by Becquerel through the action of a solution of silicate of potash on plates of sulphate of lime (gypsum).

Albano, south-east of Rome, at Capo di Bove, and elsewhere, associated with pyroxene, magnetite, mellilite, phillipsite, wollastonite, etc. ; also, according to Kenngott, on the Gorner glacier, near Zermatt, in cavities in a coarse, granular, reddish-brown garnet-rock, with epidote, calcite, chlorite, and genthite; also in the Val di Noto, Sicily, according to Scacchi, in white mammillary concretions, fibrous within. The name Zeagonite is from $cia,, to cook, and aypj,vos, barren, and was the first name of the species. Leonhard substituted the describer's name, which it has since held. Von Kobell and Marignac have analyzed crystals from the locality at Capo di Bove with a result very different from the above ; and it is supposed that the crystals taken for the analyses were a mixture of gismondite and phillipsite. The crystals were, however, received from the Italian min eralogist Medici-Spada. Credner examined a part of the same lot of crystals, and has described and figured them in the Jahrb. Min. 1847, p. 559 ; and the figures have the twin forms (cruciform to octahedral) and stri\u00e6 of phillipsite. He describes others that are rounded octahedral, with rough edges without the stri\u00e6 \u2014 the true gismondite, according to most authors \u2014 but adds that even-faced octahedrons graduate imperceptibly into the rough, and that all appear to be one spe cies. He consequently makes all the crystals orthorhombic, and closely related to phillipsite. But v. Lang has shown that the crystals are not twins, and have the above angles (Phil. Mag., IV. xxviii. 505). Von Kobell (in the Gel,Anz. Miinchen, 1839) described the crystals as tetragonal, mentioned the twins, and published the following analysis. He also places the species very near phillipsite, and iu his Geschichte der Min. (p. 487) he even queries the identity of the two. Marignac also made the crystals tetragonal octahedrons, with the angles of basal edges 92\u00b0 30', and of pyram idal 118\u00b0 31'. Analyses: 1, v. Kobell (1. c, and J. pr.

The O. ratio for the first is near 1 : 4 : 7-J : 5 ; for the second 1:3:6:3$. These analyses are sometimes placed under the name zeagonite, as if a third mineral existed at Capo di Bove distinct from the phillipsite and gismondite. But v. Kobell holds that his results give the true composi tion of gismondite. L. Gmelin, more than 40 years ago, made a chemical examination that led Mm to refer gismondite to phillipsite. Marignac regarded the mineral analyzed by him (aual. 2) as true phillipsite. Certain pale bluish octahedral crystals from Vesuvius, affording, according to Phillips, the terminal angle 122\u00b0 58', have been called zeagonite, which Hausmann refers to zircon (Handb., ii. 797)."], [475, "419 HYDEOUS SILICATE8. 373.

In the preceding table the constituents of the species are stated without the arrangement of them into formulas. Tho resemblance to the Feldspar group iu oxygen ratio seems, at first thought, to imply resemblance at least in scheme of composition. But it has been observed (p. 394) that instead of unity of crystalline form and physical characters, as in the Feldspar group, there is the utmost diversity. A relation between the proportion of silica and alkali holds through the feldspars ; but none exists, or could be rightly looked for, among the varied groups here brought together under the name of zeolitos. The water present has produced the wide divergence from the feldspars ; and it is therefore probable that this water is in part, at least, basic. This being so, they may pertain to the two divisions of Unisilicates and Bisilicates. In the following table they are arranged under these heads, and formulas added to correspond with this reference of them. The secies of the Mesotype and Levynite groups are made Unisilicates, because they have not silica enough for the bisilicate type. Thomsonite has tho 0. ratio for the bases and silica=l + 3 : 4=1 : 1, or that of a true Unisilicate; and natrolite, if the water be basic, is also unisilicate. Further, the close isomorphism of tho several species of the Mesotype group renders it probable that they are similar chemically, and therefore all unisilicate. The species of the remaining groups have silica enough for Bisilicates, and are so arranged in the following table. Yet those of the groups 3 to 5 have water enough for Unisilicates, if this water be mainly basic Thus chabazite and gmelinite have a unisilicate ratio, if two-thirds of the water is basic ; and herschelite and phillipsite, if four-fifths. But the facility with which part of the water in these species escapes is evidence that a considerable part of it, at least, is not basic. Chabazite loses over 7 p. e. of water, or more than a third, by simple exposure to dry air. For other simdar facts, see under the species beyond. It is, therefore, not at all probable that enough water is basic to make the species unisilicate.

Before the close ofthe century five subdivisions had been recognized by \"Werner and the mineralogists of his school: (1) Mehlzeolilh (mealy zeolite); (2) Fasriger zeolith or Fdserzeolith (fibrous zeolite) ; these two corresponding to the more modern mesotype (or natrolite, scolecite, mesolite, and thomsonite) ; (3 ) Slrahliger zeolith or Strahlzeolith (radiated zeolite), now stilbite ; (4) Bldttriger zeolith or Blatterzeolith (foliated zeolite), now heulandite and apophyllite ; (5) Wurfelzeolith (cubic zeolite), now chabazite and analcite. Moreover, Kreuzstein, later called harmotome, and Prehnite were regarded as distinct species ; and so also Lapis Lazuli, which had been ranked with the zeolites by Wallerius. In 1801 Haiiy gave the name of Mesotype, or Zeolite proper, to the varieties included under the first two ofthe above subdivisions, together with apophyllite ; and took a second backward step, which he never retraced, in uniting those of the third and fourth in one species under the name of Stilbite. At the same time he rightly removed Analcime from the old Cubic zeolite. In 1803 natrolite was separated from mesotype by Klaproth, and hence his name should stand for the species so designated. In 1813 Scolecite, and in 1816 Mesolite, were separated by Fuchs and Gehlen ; and in 1820 Thomsonite by Brooke. Haiiy's name mesotype is at present restricted, or should be, to a generic use to include the group of zeolites, viz*., natrolite, scolecite, mesolite, and the related species. 377. THOMSONITE.

Mesole was long since referred to thomsonite by Haidinger. Scoulerite R. D. Thomson, from Port Rush, Antrim, is mesole in structure. It has, Dr. Thom son observes, \"the same composition as thomsonite, with only (according to an analysis by R. D. Thomson) rather less alumina, and 6i p. c. of soda. The analysis has not been published. 3. Chalilite Thomson, is a compact variety, of a reddish-brown color, from the Donegore Mts., Antrim. Thomson described il in his Mineralogy (i. 324) as haviug G= 2-252, and as containing 9 p. c. of sesquioxyd of iron (most improbable with so low sp. gr.). In thc Phil Mag. for 1840 (xvii. 4o8), he describes apparently the same brown \" uncrystallized \" mineral as having G.=2*29, with \"the same constitution as the Kilpatrick thomsonite, according to au analysis by R.

Sella suggests that the magnesia may come from the associated serpentine. Pyr., etc. \u2014 The Auvergne natrolite undergoes, according to Damour, no loss in dried air. At 240\u00b0 C. it loses nearly all its water and becomes milky and opaque ; and if afterward exposed to the free air, it regains all it had lost, excepting its transparency and firm texture ; if again heated, it loses its water at about 90\u00b0 C. In the closed tube whitens and becomes opaque. B.B. fuses quietly at 2 to a colorless glass. Fusible in the flame of an ordiuary stearine or wax candle. Gelatinizes with acids. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in cavities in amygdaloidal trap, basalt, and other igneous rocks ; and sometimes in seams in granite, gneiss, and syenite. It is found in the graustein of Aussig and Teplitz in Bohemia ; in fine crystals at Puy de Marman and Puy de la Piquette in Auvergne ; at Alpstein, near Sontra in Hesse ; Monte Baldo, Tyrol ; Fassathal, Tyrol ; Kapnik in Hungary ; Dellys in Algeria ; Hogau in Wiirtemberg (the Faserzeolith W.), in yellowish radiated masses ; ete. In red amygdules (crocalite) in amygdaloid of Ireland, Scotland, and the Tyrol; the amygdaloid of Bishoptown (galacti te), acicular crystals, several inches long ; at Glen Farg in Fifeshire ; in Dum bartonshire ; in Renfrewshire ; at Glenarm in the county of Antrim ; at Port Rush ; and at Ma gee Island, near Lame, Ireland. In North America, natrolite occurs in the trap of Nova Scotia, at Gates' mountain, Cape d'Or, Swan's Creek, Cape Blomidon, Two Islands ; at Bergen Hill, N. ,T. ; sparingly at Chester, Ct. ; at Copper Falls, Lake Superior, in crystals, sometimes on native copper ; also on New York Island. Named Mesotype by Haiiy, from picas, middle, and Tinas, type, because the form of the crystal in his view a square prism\u2014 was intermediate between the forms of stilbite and analcite. Na trolite, of Klaproth, is from natron, soda ; it alludes to the presence of soda, whence also the name soda-mesotype, in contrast with scolecite, or lime-mesotype. Schumacher's name bergmannite, after Bergmann, dates from the same year (1801) with Haiiy's mesotype. Alt. \u2014 Occurs altered to prehnite. Iron-natrolite is probably an altered variety. 379.

The Irish crystals lose 7\"25 p. c. in dried air, which in six monthis increases to 9*3 p. c. ; the loss is reduced to 1*5 p. c. after a few days of exposure.

Gmelinite is usually considered rhombohedral, and the crystals as twins, secondary to a rhom bohedron of 86\u00b0 18'. Tamnau makes R A R as in chabazite, and the pyramidal faces the form |\\ The hexagonal cleavage observed by Rose separates it widely from chabazite. Named Gmelinite after Prof. Ch. Gmelin of Tubingen ; Hydrolite from tho water preseut ; Ledererite after Baron Lederer, Austrian Consul at New York. The name hydrolite has the pri ority, but is objectionable because the mineral is not so eminently hydrous as to make it deserv ing of the appellation. 388. HERSCHELITE. Levy, Ann.

Named from 'pjpj/jo's, joint, and ri^va,, to cut, alluding to the fact that the octahedron (made by the planes 1) divides parallel to the plane that passes through the terminal edges. On cryst. see Levy's Heuland ; Descloizeaux, Ann. d. M., IV. ix. S39, and Min., I 412. The. prismatic angle 124\u00b0 47' gives for tho prism i-3 the angle 87\u00b0 26' and 92\u00b0 34', which is near the angle in phillipsite ; so that while phillipsite has the 0. ratio for bases and silica of a bisilicate and the angle I A /of pyroxene, harmotome has tho 0. ratio nearly and angle I A I of horn blende. Damour and Descloizeaux show morvenite to be harmotome (Anu. d. M., IV. ix, 339). The name Andreolile of Delametherie (derived from the locality at Andreasberg) has the priority, and also Ercinite of Napione ; but Haiiy substituted harmotome. of no better signification, and all subsequent mineralogists have followed him. 391.

As he calls the mineral red stilbite from Dumbarton, a noted local ity of red stilbite familiar to him, and stilbite is easily distinguished by its pearly cleavage, it is far safer to give credit to his mineralogical opinion than to his analysis.

Decomposed by muriatic acid, without gelatinizing The sph\u00e6rostilbite gelatinizes, but Heddle says this is owing to a mixture of mesolite with tho stilbite. Obs. \u2014 Stilbite occurs mostly in cavities in amygdaloid. It is also found in some metalliferous veins, and in granite and gneiss. Abundant on the Faroe Islands, in Iceland, and on the Isle of Skye, in amygdaloid; also found on the Islo of Arran, Scotland; in Dumbartonshire, at Long Craig, and at Kilpatrick, Scot laud, in red crystals ; at Kincardine, Kilmalcolm, Campsie, Scotland ; at the Giant's Causeway. in the Mourne Mts., etc., Ireland ; at Andreasberg in the Harz, aud Kongsberg and Arendal iu Norway, with iron ore ; in the Vendayah Mts., Hindostan, in large translucent crystals having a reddish tinge ; also in the Nerbudda valley and in the Bombay Presidency ; a brown variety on granite, at the copper mines of Gustassberg, near Fahlun in Sweden ; at Andreasberg, Kongsberg, etc. Sph\u00e6rostilbite occurs in minute spheres over faroelite in Skye; at Storr (anal. 13, 14); and at Quirang, in spheres as large as a pea. In North America, sparingly in small crystals at Chester and the Charlestown syenite quarries, Mass. ; at the gneiss quarry, Thachersville, Conn., in crystals lining cavities in coarse granite ; at Hadlyme, in radiated forms on gneiss, associated with epidote, garnet, and apatite ; at Phillips town, N. Y., in crystals or fan-like groups ; opposite West Point, in a vein of decomposing bluish feldspar, intersecting gneiss, in honey-yellow crystals ; in the greenstone of Piermont, in minute crystals; in scopiform crystals of a dull yellow color, near Peekskill, N. Y. ; and at Bergen Hill, New Jersey, in small but bright crystals ; also at the Michipicoton Islands, Lake Superior ; at Partridge Island, Nova Scotia, forming a perpendicular vein from 3 to 4 inches thick, and from 30 to 5u feet long, intersecting amygdaloid, its colors white and flesh-red; also at Isle Haute, Digby Neck, Gulliver's Hole, Black Rock, Cape Blomidon, Hall's Harbor, Long Point. The iiame stilbite is from arixfin, lustre; and desmine from ilupii, a bundle. The species stilbite, na adopted by Haiiy, included Strahlzeolith Wern. (radiated zeolite, or the above), and Blatterzeo lith ire\u2122, (foliated zeolite, or the species heulandite beyond). The former was the typical part of the species, and is the first mentioned in the description ; and the latter (made the variety stilbite anamorphigue) he added to the species, as he observes, with much hesitation. In 1817, Breit haupt separated the two zeolites, and called the former desmine and the latter euzeolile, thus throwing aside entirely, contrary to rule and propriety, Haiiy's name stilbite, which should have been accepted by him in place of desmine, it being the typical part of his species. In 1822 Brooke (apparently unaware of what Breithaupt had done) used stilbite for the first, and named the other heulanditei In this he has been followed by the French and English mineralogists* while the Germans have unfortunately followed Breithaupt. Alt \u2014 Stilbite has been observed changed to quartz. 393. EPISTILBITE. Epistilbit G. Rose, Pogg., vi. 183, 1826. Monophan Breith., Char., 279, 1823. Orthorhombic.

The red color of the Fassa crystals is due, according to Kenngott, to minute crystalline grains of another mineral Pyr., etc. \u2014 According to Damour, the Faroe mineral loses part of its water in dry air, which it retakes in ordinary air ; the loss of the mineral is 2*1 p. c. at 100\u00b0 C, and 8-7 p. c. between 100\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 C. ; and this is restored again after 24 hours in the air.

Red varieties occur at Campsie in Sterlingshire, with red stilbite ; also in Fassa Valley, Tyrol ; and brown in ore beds at Arendal. At Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, it occurs in amygdaloid, presenting white and flesh-red colors, and associated with laumontite, apophyllite, thomsonite, etc. ; also at Cape Blomidon, in crystals an inch and a half in length ; at Martial's Cove, Isle Haute, Partridge Island, Swan's Creek, Two Islands, Hall's Harbor, Long Point. In the United States, with stilbite and chabazite on gneiss, at Hadlyme, Ct., and Chester, Mass. ; with these minerals and datolite, apophyllite, etc., iu amygdaloid at Bergen Hill, New Jersey ; sparingly at Kipp's Bay, New York Island, on gneiss, along with stilbite ; at McKinney's quarry, Rittenhouse Lane, near Philadelphia, sparingly ; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lao ; in minute crystals, seldom over half a line long, with hay denite, at Jones's Falls, near Baltimore, on a syenitic schist (Levy's beaumonlite, which is crystal lographically and optically identical with heulandite). Named after the English mineralogist, H. Heuland. Cesinite How (Ed. N. Phil.

Occurs in doleryte in cavities, and is often overlaid by faujasite and apophyllite. III. MARGAKOPHYLLITE SECTION. The Margarophyllites, whose general characteristics are mentioned on page 393, have the crystallization of the micas, and the name alludes to the pearly folia. Massive varieties are, however, much the most common with a large part of the species, and they often have the compactness of clay or wax. Talc, pyrophyllite, serpentine, are examples of species presenting both extremes of structure ; while pinite occurs, as thus far known, only in the compact condition. The proportion of silica varies widely, the oxygen ratio between it and the bases having the limits 3 : 1 and fa : 1, corresponding* to tersilicates at one extreme and the lower of subsilicates at the other. But, reckoning the water, or part of it, among the bases, the species may all be arranged under the heads of Bisilicates, Unisilicates, and Subsilicates ; and, although there must be much that is hypothetical in such an arrangement, the method is adopted beyond. This method of arrangement is in fact no more arbitrary than the common one of making no account of tho water. Talc has the oxygen ratio for the silica, bases, 2J : 1 ; but, at the same time, it contains water, and holds it even when highly boated, thereby indicating that part, at least, of the water is basic ; and with basic water the ratio may be 2 : 1 , or that of a true Bisil icate. The arrangement of tale at the head of the Bisilicates appears, therefore, not to be alto gether arbitrary. Pyrophyllite is a true alumina talc, it having tho same oxygen ratio as talc, and like structure, lustre, greasy feel, and even range of color ; and it has its place, therefore, next to talc, among the Bisilicates. Serpentine has not silica enough for a Bisilicate ; but, with half of its water basic, it is a Unisilicate. Kaolinite is identical with serpentine in oxygen ratio, as pyrophyllite is with talc, and is similarly a Unisilicate. Pinite has the same ratio, excepting half less of water, and is strictly an alumina-alkali serpentine ; and palagonite is another of like ratio and characters. These species, moreover, are all related to the margarodites or hydrous micas. In the following table the species are distributed under tho three heads above mentioned. Thc catalogue of the species and their formulas in the first two of these subdivisions is followed by a table containing the oxygen ratio for the protoxyds, sesquioxyds, silica, and water, and also, in another column, those for the bases, silica, and water; and under fl iu the latter, a fraction is added in parentheses, which indicates what proportion of the wa;jer (when any) is made basic in the formulas. *v"], [504, "448 OXYGEN COMPOtTlfDS.

SUBSILICA-fES. The species here arranged as Subsilicates seem to blend indefinitely with the Unisilicates The common chlorites have atomically three-fourths, two-thirds, or less, of silica than bases, and are manifestly subsilicate in ratio. But they graduate into the pyrosclerites, which are true Unisilicates, if the water is not partly basic, and thus pass into the margarodites above. Yet the pyrosclerites have so much resemblance to the chlorites that they seem to belong to the same natural group. Under the uncertainty with regard to the amount of basic water, the species are enumerated in the following table with their oxygen ratios, and with the constituents unarranged into formulas. It is, however, interesting to observe that the species of pyrosclerites and chlorites may all have the formula of a two-thirds silicate if all or part of the water be made basic ; and if the ratio 3 : 2 be the right one for this first section of the Subsilicates, the Subsilicates will then have the ratio 3 : 2 for the first or Chlorite group, 2 : 1 for the second or Chloritoid, and 3 : 1 for the Seybertite pgroup.

The steatite from Gopfersgriin, in which Klaproth found but 59*5 per cent, of silica, along with Mg 30*5, Fe 2*3, fl 5*5 (Beitr., ii. 177), is what has been called hydrosteatite. An impure, leek-green. indurated talc, from Bristol, Ct., afforded H. H. Lummis (Am. J. Sci., II. xxxi. 308) Si 64*00, Fe 4-75, Mg2747, fl 4-30=98-52.

Not decomposed by acids. Rensselaerite is decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid. Obs. \u2014 Talc or steatite is a very common mineral, and in tho latter form constitutes extensive beds in some regions. It is often associated with serpentine, talcose or chloritic schist, and dolo mite, and frequently contains crystals of dolomite, breunnerite, asbestus, actinolite, tourmaline, magnetite. Steatite is the material of many pseudomorphs, among which the most common are those after pyroxene, hornblende, mica, scapolite, and spinel. The magnesian minerals are those which com monly afford steatite by alteration ; while those like scapolite and nephelite, which contain soda and no magnesia, most frequently change to pinite-like pseudomorphs. There are also steatitic pseudomorphs after quartz, dolomite, topaz, chiastolite, staurolite, cyanite, garnet, idocrase, chrysolite, gehlenite. Hunt has shown that talc (or steatite) is a rare mineral in Azoic or pr\u00e6silurian crystalline rocks. The occurrence of rensellaerito in these rocks in northern New York is no exception, any moro than pyrallolite in those of Finland, these being products of subsequent alteration or metamoi phism. Apple-green talc occurs in the Greiner mountain in Saltzburg ; in the Valais, aud other places above mentioned; also in Cornwall, near Lizard Point, with serpentine ; in Scotland, with ser."], [510, "454 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. pentine, at Portsoy and elsewhere; on Unst, one of tho Shetland islands ; at Croky Head, Duag low, Ireland ; etc. In N. America, foliated talc occurs in Maine, at Dexter. In Vermont, at Bridgewater, handseme green talc, with dolomite ; at Athens or Grafton, Westfield, Slarlboro, Newfane. In New Hamp shire, at Francestown, Pelham, Orford, Keene, and Richmond. In Mass., at Middlefield, Windsor, Blanford, Andover, and Chester. In R. Island, at Smithfield, delicate pgreen, and white in a crys talline limestone. In N. York, near Amity ; on Staten Island, near the quarantine, common and indurated; four miles distant, in detached masses made up of folia, snow-white. In N. Jersey, ai Lockwood, Newton, and Sparta. In Penn., at Texas, Nottingham, Unionville ; in South Mountain, ten miles south of Carlisle ; at Chestnut Hill, on the Schuylkill, talc and also soapstone, the latter quarried extensively. In Maryland, at Cooptown, of green, blue, and rose colors. In N. Car., at \"Webster, Jackson Co., a variety supposed by Genth to be altered chrysolite. In Canada, at Potton, with steatite, in metamorphic Silurian ; in the township of Elzivir, an impure grayish var. in Azoic rocks. The so-called rensselaerite occurs in northern New York, in the towns of Antwerp (with the form of pyroxene), Fowler, Dekalb, Edwards (at the iron mine, a white variety, from which ink stands have been made), Russel, Gouverneur, Canton (in small crystals), Hermon (in large masses, crystalline massive) ; and in Canada, at Grenville, Charleston Lake, near Brockville, Rawdon, and Ramsay. It is often associated with crystalline limestone, and graduates at times imperceptibly into serpentine ; its rock -masses are irregular, and are seldom continuous for more than three or four hundred yards. Slabs of steatite are extensively employed as firo stones in furnaces and stoves. It may be turned in a lathe, or formed into tubes by boring. The fine-grained varieties (including the rensselaerite) are sometimes carved into ornaments, etc. When ground, it is used for diminishing friction. It is also employed in the manufacture of some kinds of porcelain. Venetian talc is used for removing oil stains from woollen cloth, etc. A white steatite of a silvery -pearly lustre was the Magnelis of Theophrastus \u2014 a stone, accord ing to this author, of silvery lustre, occurring in large masses, and easily cut or wrought. The word is the origin ofthe modern magnesia. Agricola, in his \"Interpretatio Rerum Metallicarum \" appended to his works (1546), gives as a German synonym of Magnetis, Talck; and he adds, as other synonyms, Silberweiss and Katzensilber, and also Glimmer, the German now for mica, evi dently confounding the two minerals. He mentions its resistance to fire, and speaks of it as lapis scissilis. Other later writers derive the word talc from the Arabic talk; and Aldrovandus (1648) states that it is of Sloorish introduction, adding, \" Hoc nomeu apud Mauritanos stellam sig-uificare dici tur,\" Stella Terr\u0153\u2014 Star of the Earth \u2014 being one old name of the mineral, given it because \" like a star and with silvery lustre it shines.\" C\u00e6sius (\" De Mineralibus,\" 1636) writes the word in Latin, Talchus, but most other writers of that century, Talcum. The word steatilis occurs in Pliny as the name of a stone resembling fat ; but no further descrip tion is given that can with certainty identify it. Rensselaerite was named after Stephen Van Rensselaer, of Albany, N. Y. 400A. Talooid Naumann (Min., 5th edit., 255, 1859) is a snow-white, broadly-foliated talc of Pressnitz, described by Scheerer as neulraler kieselsaurer Hydro-talc (Pogg., lxxxiv. 385) ; G.=248. \u25a0Analyses by Scheerer and Richter Si Si fig Fe fl 1.

Obs. \u2014 Compact pyrophyllito is the material or base of some schistose rocks. The foliated variety is often the gangue of cyanite. Pyrophyllite occurs in the Urals, between Pyschminsk and Beresof; at Westana, Sweden ; the Horrsjoberg in Elfdalen, with cyanite; near Ottrez ia Luxembourg; in Brazil. Also in white stellate aggregations in Cottonstone Mtn., Mecklenburg Co., N. C. ; in Chesterfield Dist., S. G, with lazulite and cyanite ; in Lincoln Co., Ga., on Graves Mtn. ; in Arkansas, at the Kellogg lead mine, near Little Rock. The compact kind, resembling a slaty soapstone in aspect and feel, is found in large beds at Deep River, N. C, greenish to yellowish-white in color, with G.=2*91 ; similar at Carbonton, Sloore Co., N. C., having G.=2-82. The compact pyrophyllite of Deep River, N. C, is extensively used for making slate pencils. Thomson, in au analysis of his nacrite (Ree. Gen. Sci., iii. 332) from \"Brunswick \" (should havi\u00bb been Unity), Maine, obtained the composition of a pyrophyllite.

He ob serves that more or less carbonate of magnesia is often found in the meerschaum (Am. J. Sci., II. vii. 286); also found in Greece ; at Hrubschitz in Sloravia ; inSIorocco; at Vallecas in Spain, in extensive beds, affording a light but valuable building stone. The mineral from Morocco, called in French Pierre de savon de Maroc, is used in place of soap at the Moorish baths in dif ferent places in Algeria. The word meerschaum is German for sea-froth, and alludes to its lightness and color. Sepiolite Glocker, is from .jjjirpa, cullle-fish, the bone of which is light and porous ; and being also a pro duction of the sea, \" deinde spumam marinam significabat,\" says Glocker. Brongniart, in the first edition of his Mineralogy (1807), included under Magnesite (1) the car bonate, which he calls Mitchell's magnesite (see umler SIagnesite) ; (2) the hydrous silicate or meerschaum ; and (3) the siliceous carbonate from Baudissero in Piedmont ; he putting \"Mitchell's magnesite,\" the carbonate, first. Karsten, in his \"Tabellen,\" published the next year, separ ated from meerschaum tho carbonate, and adopted for it thc name magnesite, and in this he has been followed by all German and most other mineralogists. The application of the namo magne site to the hydrous silicate, done in the later writings of Brongniart and by subsequent French mineralogists, is hence in violation of the law of priority. 403.

In most of the analyses the state of oxydation of the iron was not determined._ Haushofer, who examined this point, gives as the most common oxygen ratio for R, fi, Si, fl, 1:3:9: 3, and writes the formula RSi4-R Si3+3 fl=(if fi=4Fe+|- A, and fi=jFe+^Sl) Silica 49-3, alumina 3'6, sesquioxyd of iron 22-7, protoxyd of iron 6'3, potash 8*3, water 9-6. The ratio is that of a hornblende, and especially acmite, excepting the water and the presence of potash in place of soda, this ratio between the bases and silica being 1 : 2}. Differs from celadonite in being decomposed by muriatic acid. The kinds of glauconite are : 1 . Green earth of cavities in eruptive rocks ; to which the chlorophanerite of G.

An analysis by Haushofer of a glauconitic limestone (muschelkalk) from Wiirzburg is given in J. pr. Ch., xcix. 237. The glauconite grains are most abundant in the \" green sand \" of the chalk formation, some times constituting 75 to 90 p. c. of the whole. They are often casts of the shells of Rhizopods. The material has also been found in Silurian rocks, and beds of other geological periods, and even in the shells of recent Rhizopods, and in fragments of coral obtained in deep sea soundings (Am. J. Sci., II. xxii. 281). The glauconite of the Silurian, analyzed by Hunt, contains less iron and more alumina than that of the chalk formation.

Var. \u2014 Slany unsustained species have been made out of serpentine, differing in struerture (massive, slaty, foliated, fibrous), or, as supposed, in chemical composition ; and these now, in part, stand as varieties, along with some others based on variations in texture, hardness, etc. A. Massive. ( 1 ) Ordinary massive, (a) Precious or Noble Serpentine (Edler Serpentin Germ.) is of a rich oil-green color, of pale or dark shades, and translucent even when in thick pieces ; and (b) Common Serpentine, when of dark shades of color, and subtranslucent. The former has a hardness of 2-5 \u2014 3 ; the latter often of 4 or beyond, owing to impurities. 2. Resinous. Retinalite Thomson (Sfin., i. 201, 1836) is massive serpentine, having honey-yel low to light oil-green colors, and waxy or resin-like lustre and aspect. H.=3-5 ; G. = 247\u2014 2*52, Grenville, Hunt, 2*36 \u2014 2*38, Calumet Id., Hunt. It much resembles deweylite. It affords, on analysis, 3 p. c. more of water than ordinary serpentine ; and it is probable that the mineral is a mixture of serpentine and deweylite. Named from pcTivfi, resin, and from specimens obtained at Grenville, C. W. Vorhauserile Kenngott (Slin. Forsch., 1856-57, 71) is the same, though brown to greenish-black in color. H.=3-5 ; G. = 2-45.

H. Stockh., 1840). This variety is sometimes very soft when first taken out. A variety resembling ccmpact lithomarge occurs at Middletown, Delaware Co., Pa. (anal. 37). It has a smooth, porcelain-like fracture; H.=3*5, G.=248. 4. Bowenite Dana (Min., 265, 1850, Nephrite Bowen, Am. J. Sci., v. 346, 1822) is massive, ot very fine granular texture, and much resembles nephrite, and was long so called. It is apple green or greenish-white in color ; G. = 2-594 \u2014 2-787, Bowen ; and it has the unusual hardness 5-5 \u2014 6, which is some evidence that this variety may be a good species, although proved by Smith \u25a0A Brush to be identical with serpentine in composition. From Smithfield, R. I. B. Lamellae. 5. Antigorite Schweizer (Pogg., xlix. 595, 1840) is thin lamellar in structure, easily separating into translucent or subtransparent folia ; H. = 2*5; G. = 2*622; color brownish-green by reflected light, and leek-green by transmitted ; feel smooth, but not greasy. Polarizes light, according to Haidinger. Named from the locality, Antigorio valley, Piedmont. 6. Williamsite Shepard (Am. J. Sci., II. vi. 249, 1848) is a lamellar impure serpentine, of apple green color, with H. =4-5 and G. = 2*59 \u2014 2-64, from Texas, Pa. Does not doubly refract, Descl. Graduates into a massive granular variety. C. Thin Foliated. 7. Marmolite Nuttall (Am. J. Sci., iv. 19, 1822, but shown to be a variety of serpentine by Vanuxem, J. Acad. Sci. Philad., hi. 133, 1823) is thin foliated; the lamin\u00e6 brittle but easily separable, yet graduating into a variety in which they are not separable (which variety has sometimes been called in the United States kerolile). G. = 241 ; lustre pearly; colors green ish-white, bluishwhite, to pale asparagus-green. From Hoboken, N. J. Folia from Hoboken without polarization, according to Websky ; feebly polarizing, according to Descloizeaux. 8. Thermophyllite A. Nordenskiold (Beskrifn. Fin. Min., 160, 1855, flermann, J. pr. Ch., lxxiii. 213). Occurs in small scaly crystals aggregated into masses, with an amorphous steatite-like base. B.B. crystals exfoliate like vermiculite or pyrophyllite. H.=2'5; G.=2'61, Nord. ; 2*56, Herm. Lustre of cleavage surface pearly ; color light brown to silver-white and yellowish-brown. Optically biaxial ; the axial angle 22\u00b0 20' ; bisectrix negative, normal to plane of cleavage, Miller. From Hopansuo, Finland. D. Fibrous. 9. Chrysotile v. Kobell (J. pr. Ch., ii. 297, 1834, xxx. 467, 1843; Schillernder Asbest ; Ami anthus pt.) is delicately fibrous, the fibres usually flexible and easily separating; lustre silky, or silky metallic; color greenish-white, green, olive-green, yellow, and brownish; G.=2'219. Often constitutes seams hi serpentine. It includes most of the silky amianthus of serpentine rocks. The original chrysotile was from Reichenstein. 10. Picrolite Hausmann (Sloll's Efem., iv. 401, 1808) is columnar, but fibres or columns not easily flexible, and often not easily separable, or affording only a long splintery fracture ; color dark green to mountain-green, greenish, gray, and brown. The original was from Taberg, Sweden. Metaxite Breithaupt (Char., 113, 326, 1832) is picrolite, consisting of separable but brittle columns, of a greenish-white color, and weak pearly lustre; H. = 2\u20142-5; G. = 2*52. From Schwarzenberg. Passes into a laminated variety. Baltimorite Thomson (Phil. M*ag., xxii. 191, 1843) is picrolite from Bare Hills, Md., of a grayish green color; silky lustre, opaque, or subtranslucent, with H. = 2-5\u20143. E. Crystallized Serpentine. The observed crystals are all pseudomorphs. The most com- mon have tlie form of chrysolite, and the annexed figure represents one of this kind. Rose has observed some crystals which were still partly 412 chrysolite.* Delesse states that the serpentine of Odern graduates into feldspar, and appears to have been derived from the alteration of that mineral. Other kinds are pseudomorphs after pyroxene, amphibole, spinel, chondrodite, garnet, phlogopite, sphene, and chromic iron. Even the foliated and fibrous kinds may be partly pseudomorphous. If marmolite or thermophyllite is truly crystallized serpentine, as seems probable, the crystallization of the species is actually micaceous, like that of chlorite and talc. F. Serpentine Rocks. Serpentine often constitutes rock-masses. It frequently occurs mixed with more or less of dolomite, magnesite, or calcite, making a rock of clouded green, sometimes voined with white or pale green, called verd-antigue, or ophiolite. Ophiolite is styled by Hunt (1) dolomitic, (2) magnesiiic, or (3) calcitic, according as the ser pentine is mixed with dolomite, magnesite, or calcite. Serpentine rock is Bometimes mottled with red, or has something of the aspect of a red porphyry ; the reddish portions containing an unusual amount of oxyd of iron. Any serpentine rock cut into slabs and polished, is called serpentine marble. \u2022\"in"], [522, "466 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. pp Comp.\u2014 0. ratio for Mg, Si, fl=3 : 4 : 2, corresponding to 2 Si, 3 Ilg, 2 fl=Silica 44*14, mag. nesia 42*97, water 12*89.

Brush found in the metaxite of Schwarzenberg (priv. contrib.) only 0*78 p. c. of Al, with 45*03 Si, and 2-98 Fe. Nuttall gave the following incorrect analysis of the marmolite of Hoboken in connection with his first description of the mineral (Am. J.

Stromeyer found of oxyd of nickel 0-32 to 0-45 p. c. in the serpentine of Roraas ; 0-30 in that of Sundal; and 0-22 in that of Saxony. Lynchnell obtained 2-24 p. c. from one serpentine. Hunt has detected it in the serpentine of the Green Slountains generally, that of Roxbury, Vt., of New Haven, Ct., of Hoboken, N. J., of Cornwall, Eng., of Banffshire, Scoti., of the Vosges, Fr. ; but none in the ophiolites of the Azoic (Laurentian) rocks of Canada, or the serpentine of Easton, Pa., or of the wax-yellow variety of Montville, N.

Obs. \u2014 Serpentine ofteu constitutes mountain masses. It is a metamorphic rock, it resulting from the alteration of other rocks, and mostly of those of sedimentary origin ; and is of various periods in origin, from the Azoic age upward. Crystals of serpentine (pseudomorphous) occur in the Fassa valley, Tyrol ; near Sliask at Lake Auschkul, Barsovka, Katharinenburg, and elsewhere ; in Norway, at Snarum ; etc. Fine precious serpentines come from Fahlun and Gulsjo in Sweden, the Isle of Man, the neighborhood of Port soy in Aberdeenshine, in Cornwall, Corsica, Siberia, Saxony, etc. The names of many localities are given above. In N. America, in Maine, at Deer Isle, precious serpentine of a light green color. In Vermont, at New Fane, Cavendish, Jay, Roxbury, Troy, Westfield.

In Maryland, at Bare Hills ; at Cooptown, Harford Co., with diallage ; also in the north part of Cecil Co. In Canada, at Orford, Ham, Bolton, etc. In N. Brunswick, at Crow's Nest in Portland. Serpentine admits of a high polish, and may be turned in a lathe, and is sometimes employed as a material for ornaments, vases, boxes, etc. At Z'jblitz in Saxony, Bayreuth, and in Franconia, several hundred persons are employed in this manufacture. Verd-antique marble is clouded with green of various shades, and is a beautiful material for table and ornamental indoor work. Ex posed to the weather it wears uneven, owing to its unequal harduess, and soon loses its polished surface. The names Serpentine, Ophite, Lapis colubrinus, allude to the greet serpent-like cloudings of the serpentine marble.

Bastite is an impure foliated serpentine, occurring imbedded in serpentine rock, and is supposed to be a result of the alteration of a foliated mineral of the Pyroxene group, as long since announced by G. Rose. That of Baste, the original locality, was derived, according to Streng, from the enstatite (protobastite) ofthe region (see Enstatite, p. 208).

Besides the direction of perfect cleavage, there are two inclined to one another about 87\u00b0 (Naumann), which is the cleav age of enstatite and hypersthene. According to Descloizeaux, it is probably orthorhombic, and has a negative bisectrix, which is normal to the plane of cleavage, and gives for the axial diver gence 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. A kind from Todtmoos in the Schwarzwald is thin foliated cleavable, and has a dark green color, but is metallic pearly on the cleavage-face; H. = 34; G.=2-55; and shows under the microscope in polarized light that it is not homogeneous.

Obs. \u2014 The pholerite of Guillemin was from nodules of iron ore in the coal mines of Fins, Dept ol Allier, France. The Chemnitz mineral is from Niederrabenstein (and also at Zeisigwald, etc.), where it constitutes a rock called by Naumann pelitische felsiltuffe in the Lower Coal formation ; it is various in color,*but is shown to consist of crystalline, colorless, doubly refracting scales. The Schemnitz is the gangue of diaspore, and it may be kaolinite impure with diaspore. The Jack sonville is a kaolin, and may be kaolinite ; the analysis afforded 4*86 of free silica, and 0-90 of undecomposed material which above is excluded. The analyses of kaolinite have been referred to pholerite under the idea that Guillemiu's analy sis was incorrect. But the analysis by Knop appears to show that there is a species with the pholerite composition, but not differing from kaolinite in its physical or crystallographic characters.

Slin., 1859, 546) that the teratolite is an impure lithomarge-like pholerite, closely related to the mineral from Chemnitz. It is described as having H. = 2 \u2014 24, and G. = 249 \u2014 2-5 ; color varied with lavender and other shades of blue, and spots of red. and rarely pearl gray. It is from an amygdaloidal rock overlaid by coal strata at Planitz near Zwickau in Saxony, It contains much oxyd of iron; but, according to Knop, probably is a mixture of pholerite with some free quartz, pulverized feldspar, hydrate of iron, carbonate of lime, and magnesia.

Obs. \u2014 Ordinary kaolin is a result of the decomposition of aluminous minerals, especially the feldspars of granitic and gneissoid rocks and porphyries. In some regions where these rocks have decomposed ou a large scale, the resulting clay remains in vast beds of kaolin, usually more or less mixed with free quartz, and sometimes with oxyd of iron from some of the other minerals present. Pure kaolinite in scales often occurs in connection with iron ores of the Coal formation. It sometimes forms extensive beds in the Tertiary formation, as near Richmond, Va. Also met with accompanying diaspore and emery or corundum. Occurs in the coal formation at Cache- Apres in Belgium ; also in the same at Schlan in Bohemia. and at R'jhe ; in argillaceous schist at Lodeve, Dept. of Herault, France ; at the Einigkeit ruins \u00bbt Brand, near Freiberg, and elsewhere in Saxony ; as kaolin at Diendorf (Bodenmais) in Bavaria;"], [531, "475 HYDK0TJ8 SILICATES, MAEGjAEOPUYLLITE SECTION. at Zeisigwald near Chemnitz ; as the gangue of topaz at Schneckenstein ; with emery and mar garite at Naxos; as the gangue of diaspore at Schemnitz; as the material of pseudomorphs aster prosopite at Altenberg (anal. 8), showing well the hexagonal scales (Johnson & Blake) ; with fluor at Zinnwald, a white powdery substance oonsisting of hexag. scales ; at Rochlitz (carnat) in a porphyritic rock ; in seams in an argillaceous rock on the Tweed (tuesite), the Latin name of which place is Tuesis. At Yrieix, near Limoges, is the best locality of kaolin in Europe (a discovery of 1765); it affords material for the famous Sevres porcelain manufactory. The dark-colored clay of Stourbridge, England, is made up in large part of transparent lamin\u00e6 (J. & B.). In the U. States, kaolin occurs at Newcastle and Wilmington, Del. ; at various localities in the limonite region of Vermont (at Brandon, etc.), Massachusetts, Pennsylvania; Jacksonville, Ala.; Edgefield, S. C. ; near Augusta, Ga. ; and Johnson & Blake observed transparent hexagonal scales abundantly in a blue fire-clay from Sit. Savage, Md. ; in tho white clay of Brandon, Vt., Beekraau, N. Y., Perth Amboy, N. J., Reading, and a locality in Chester Co., Pa., Long Island, and iu white and colored clays of various other places. Near Richmond, Va., the mealy constitutes a bed of considerable extent in the Tertiary formation ; at Tamaqua and Summit Hill in Carbon Co., Pa., it occurs iu the Coal formation ; in a sandstone of the Quebec group, just below the Chaudiere Falls, filling seams or fissures, often 4 iu. thick, having an unctuous feel, and consist ing of minute soft scales. The characters of this species have been well denned, and its relation to kaolin explained, in an article by Johnson & Blake (1. c), by whom the name kaolinite was proposed They show that Forchammer's formula for kaolin is the true formula, and also that of kaolinite ; and that the two are oue in species chemically and physically. They point out that much lithomarge should be included, and that the hexagonal scales, which the massive mineral presents under the microscope, may be detected in all kaolin, and also in some dark-colored fire-clays, although much mixed with impurities. They also show that the plasticity of the kaolinite depends on the fineness of the material, aud that kinds not plastic in water may be rendered so by fine trituration. They suggest that the distinction of kaolinite and pholerite may disappear on further chemical investigation. The earliest recognition of the mineral distinctively is by Werner in 1780 (1. a), who placed it under talc. It afterward took the namo of earthy talc, as used by Hoffmann in 1789 (1. c). The acute Karsten pronounced it a scaly clay (schuppige T/ion), and arranged it accordingly in 1S08 (1. c.) ; but no author of the next twenty years fully adopted his view. In 1807 Brongniart made the species nacrite (1. a), for a fusible, anhydrous, pearly poiash-.nica, analyzed by Vauquelin (affording Si 50, Al 26, Pe 5, Ca 1-5, K 17*5), aud referred to it doubtingly the earthy talc, in a note, without any knowledge of it. Hausmann, in 1813 (Handb., 500), says that the schuppige Talc of Andreasberg in the flarz (which he says is wrongly called buitermilchsilber) may perhaps be schuppige Hydrargillite (hydrate of alumiua) or Thon, but an analysis was needed to decide it. Hoff mann, iu 1815 (Handb., ii. b, 268), makes it his first variety of talc, but queries its nature, and cites an analysis by John of a hydrato of alumina. In 1832 (1. c.) Breithaupt gave the Saxon mineral the name nacrite (nakrit), without any appar ent reference in the place to Brongniart's or Vauquelin's previous use of this name. But he at the same time questions whether it may not bo identical with pholerite (which had been described iu 1825). Since then the species has been united to pholerite, under the idea that pholerite was incorrectly analyzed by Guillemin (which may still be true) ; and Breithaupt, in 1841 (Haudb., 391), adopts this view, putting pholerite of Guillemin under nacrite ; and, moreover, he attributes his name nacrite to Vauquelin. This was the state of the question when the description of kaolinite by Johnson and Blake appeared. Breithaupt, in 1832, stated that tho scales were hexagonal ; and again in his account of the \"nakrit\" of Brand near Freiberg. A. Knop, in 1S59 (Jahrb. Slin. 1859, 594), describes with detail the crystallization of thc Schneckenstein mineral ; he makes it rhombic, with the planes 7, O, t'-i, and gives the angle I A 7=118\u00b0. Descloizeaux, in his Mineralogy (1862), shows that optically the scales from Brand, near Freiberg, are orthorhombic, and makes the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 ; and Johnson & Blake give the same angles as a mean of their measurements of various kaolinites. The name Kaolin is a corruption of the Chinese Kauling, meaning high-ridge, the name of a hill near Jauchau Fu, where the material is obtained ; and the petuntze (peh-tun-tsz) of the Chinese, with which the kaolin is mixed in China for the manufacture of porcelain, is a quartzose feld- Bpathic rock, consisting largely of quartz (S. W. Williams). The word porcelain was first giveu to the china-ware by the Portuguese, from its resemblance to the nacre of the sea-shells Parcel lana (Cypr\u00e6as), they supposing it to be made from egg-shells, fish-glue, and fish scales (S. W. Williams). 420. HALLOYSITE. Halloysite Berthier, Ann. Ch. Phys., xxxii. 332, 1826. Galapektit Gummit, Breith., Char., 99, 1832. Glagerit Breith., Handb., 357, 1841.

Smectite of Salvetat is greenish, and in certain states of humidity appears transparent and almost gelatinous ; it is from Conde, near Houdan, France. Breithaupt's Gummite (Char., 99, 1832) is a \"gum-like haUoysite,\" not adhering to the tongue, from Anglar, though in his Handbuch, where the same locality is mentioned, he quotes Berthier's analysis of collyrite from the Pyrenees. Glossecollite is milk-white and earthy, but becomes translucent on the edges and a little opaline in water. It forms a seam 1 in. thick in a siUceous Sdurian rock in Rising Fawn, Dade Co., Georgia. 3. Lenzinile is earthy, compact, white, translucent, and somewhat opaUne, from Kail in the Eifel ; and brownish, from rifts in pegmatite at La VUate, near Chanteloube, in France. Leonhard considered it (Handb., 1826) a decomposed semiopal. It is described as not gelatinizing in acids. Named after the German mineralogist Lenz. Nertschinskite of Razoumovski, a whitish or bluish earth from Nertschinsk, has been referred to lenzinite. Severite, or lenzinite of St. Sever, was first noticed in 1818, and analyzed in that year by PeUetier (J. de Phys., lxxxvi. 251, 1818). It has sometimes the semitransparency of opal, a soft feel, adheres strongly to the tongue, and makes no paste with water ; it is from the upper arenaceous stratum in the gypsiferous Tertiary at St. Sever in France. It is not clear whether it belongs here or to kaolinite. 4. Bole, in part, may belong here ; that is, those colored, unctuous clays containing more or less oxyd of iron, which also have about 24 p. c. of water ; the iron gives it a brownish, yellow ish, or reddish color ; but more investigation is needed before it is known that they are not mere mixtures. Oropion of Glocker (Syn., 188, 1847) is a dark brown to black bole ; it is the Bergseife of Werner (Ueb.

Theophrastus speaks of two other kinds of sinopic earth, one whitish, the other between the red and white in color, and called the pure kind because it was used without mixing; besides also an artificial kind make by burning a clay \u2014 the clay be coming red owing to the hydrated oxyd of iron present, which was freed from its water by the heat. 420B.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Pinite is essentially a hydrous alkaline silicate. Being a result of alteration, and amorphous, the mineral varies much in composition, and numerous species have been made of the mineral in its various conditions. If crystals of staurolite may vary 20 p. c. in the propor tion of silica, much more should a massive mineral which has been made by the metamorphism of other minerals. Variations would naturally exist from the presence of some of the unaltered original mineral, or of some of its ingredients in an uncombined state ; and in the case of rock masses, from mixture with free quartz, partially altered or unaltered feldspar, or other substances. The varieties of pinite here admitted agree closely in physical characters, and in the amount of potash and water present, and thoir variations are such as are reasonably attributed to the above causes. The 0. ratio for the bases, silica, and water, deduced from the mean of the analyses, is 3 : 4 : 1, whence the formula (4A3+f (R3,fi))2Si3=. iffl=K and fl3 : fi=l : 8, Silica 46-0, alumina 35-1, potash 12*0, water 6*9=100 ; or, if R=iSfg+\u00a3 A and R3 : H=l : 5, =Silica 45*9, alumina 32-7, magnesia 2*5, potash 12-0, water 6-9=100 ; or, if Jig : fl=5 : 7 and R3 : fi=l : 5, =Silica 46-2, alumina 33-0, magnesia 3-3, potash 10-6, water 6-9 = 100. The mineral is related chemically, as it is also physically, to serpentine (which has the O. ratio 3:4:2); and it is an alkali-alumiua serpentine, as pyrophyllite is an alumina talc. The different kinds are either pseudomorphous crystals after (1) iolite ; (2) nephelite ; (3) scap olite; (4) some kind of feldspar; (5) spodumene : or (6) other aluminous mineral ; or (7) dissem inated masses resembling indurated talc, steatite, lithomarge, or kaolinite, also a result of altera tion; or (8) the prominent or sole constituent of a metamorphic rock, which is sometimes apini.lt schist (analogous to, and often much resembling, talcose schist, and still more closely related to pyrophyllite schist). As argillaceous shale often consists of pulverized feldspar, its conversion into pinite schist would be wholly similar to the pseudomorphism of a feldspar crystal into pinite. It is not possiblo to arrange all the varieties under the above heads. The following are the names that have been introduced, and the characters of the substances to which they are applied : Var. 1. Pinite. Speckstein [fr. tho Pini mine at Aue, near Schneeberg] Hoffmann, Bergm. J., 156, 1789; Kieselerde + Thonerde, etc., Klapr., ib., 227, 1790. Pinit Karsten, Tab., 28, 73, 1800.) Tho original pinite is in 6- to 9-sided prisms ; color brown. Occurs in granite, and is supposed to be pseudomorphous after iolite. Also found at St. Pardoux in Auvergne, at the Puy de Dome, in decomposing feldspar porphyry ; at Miihlenthal, near Elbingerode, the prisms 12-sided, lustreless, with H. =2\u2014 3. Anal. 1-7. 2.

Brought by Giesecke* from Akulliardsuk and Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland, where it occurs in compact feldspar. Also of similar characters from a pyroxone rock at Diana, N. Y., the prisms often large, and with the basal edges replaced by a plane inclined about 135\u00b0 to the base. Anal. 8-11. (b) Lythrodes Karsten (Mag. Ges. Fr. Berlin, iv. 78, 1810; John, Ch. Unt., i. 171; Splittriger Wernerit Hausm., 520, 1813) has a little less silica and more alumina than the above (anal. 12), but is otherwise essentially the same ; it is imperfectly lamellar, scaly in fracture, greasy in lustre ; yellow, flesh red, brownish-red, or spotted with greenish and yellowish ; G.=2-51 ; and is from the zircon-syenite of Fredericksvarn and Laurvig. It is regarded as altered nephelite. Of like composition and origin is tho (c) Liebenerite Slarignac (Bibl. Univ., yi. 293, 1848), from a porphy ritic feldspathic rock of Sit.

Sci., II. xii. 209) is essentially the same with the gieseckite from Diana and elsewhere, Lewis Co., N. Y. ; it constitutes masses or a rock, sometimes slaty in structure, and somewhat resembles serpentine, though more waxy in aspect (anal. 18,19); H.=3\u2014 3-5; G. = 2-76\u2014 2-81; colors often mottled, usually greenish, some times reddish or spotted with red. Associated with phlogopite, etc. (\u00ab' Parophite T. 8. Hunt (Rep. G.

It constitutes a schistose rock at St. Nicholas and Famine R., Can., being an altered shale of the Lower Silurian (Quebec group) ; also occurs in Stanstead, Can., on the E. shore of L.

It is from Bathurst, Can., where it was first found by Dr. Wilson ; also St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. Terenite-(p. 323), from Antwerp, St. Lawrence Co., may be the same. 4. Poltargite and Rosite of Svanberg (Ak. H. Stockh., 1 840) are close to the preceding in composition. Rosite (anal. 28) is a granular red mineral, occurring in granular limestone at Aker in Sodermanland ; H=2*5; G. = 2*72. G. Rose and others make it altered anorthite. Polyargik (anal. 26, 27) occurs in reddish lamellar masses at Tunaberg, Sweden; H. =4; G.=2*768; named from naXis, much, and iny6s, sparkle. The name Pyrrhotite has been given to a reddish lamellar mineral from Tunaberg, which is very similar to polyargite (Descl. Slin., i. 302, 1862); ithasH.= 3\u20144; and cleavage surfaces inclined together about 87 3; and is apparently anorthite less altered than in rosite and polyargite. It is optically biaxial. The \" pinitoid \" of Sasbachwald, Duchy of Baden (anal. 35), is altered oligoclase, according to Sandberger ; H. =2*5. 5. Killinite Thomson (Min., i. 330, 1836), from Killiney Bay, Ireland, has been stated to have the form and cleavage of spodumene, a mineral that occurs in the vicinity. It has H.=4; G.= 2*56\u20142*66, Thomson; 2-678\u2014 2-688, Galbraith; lustre weak vitreous ; color greenish-gray, brown ish, or yellowish; anal. 29-33. 6. Other pinite has passed under the name of lithomarge (Steinmark Germ.). That of Zorgo (anal. 36) is green, and has G.=3-086, Ramm. The Schemnitz mineral (anal. 37) occurs with dill nite and kaolinite as the gangue of diaspore, and is gray or greenish-gray in color, with H.=2-5 \u20143, G. = 2'735. AnaL 47 is of a lithomarge from Schlackenwald. That of Ems (anal. 48) is green to white, and kaolin-like in consistence, and occurs in clefts in the Spirifer sandstone. The compact talc of Klammberg, Tyrol, is probably pinite or agalmatolite in constitution. 7. Agalmatolite (Agalmatolithus, Bildstein (fr. China), Klapr., Beitr., ii. 184, 1797. Pagoplite Napione, J. de Phys., xlvi. 220, 1798). Like ordinary massive pinite in its amorphous compact texture, lustre, and other physical characters, but contains more silica, so as to afford the formula of a bisilicate, or nearly, and it may be a distinct species. Yet, as above observed, the excess of silica is possibly from free quartz or feldspar as impurity. The Chinese has H. = 2 \u2014 2*5 ; G= 2-785 \u2014 2*815, EUapr. Colors same as for pinite, usually grayish, grayish-green, brownish, yellow ish. Anal. 3S-41. A similar mineral in composition comes from Nagyag in Transylvania, and Ochsenkopf near Schwarzenberg in Saxony (anal. 44). Agalmatolite was named from aya\\fia, an image, and pagodite from pagoda, the Chinese carving the soft stone into miniature pagodas, images, etc. Part of the so-called agalmatolite of China is true pinite in composition, another part is compact pyrophyllite (p. 455), and still another steatite (p. 453). (Brush, Am. J. Sci., II. xxvi. 64.) Oncosin v. Kobell (J. pr. Ch., ii. 295, 1834) is related in' composition (anal. 45), and has H.=2; G. = 2-8; color apple-green to grayish or brownish; translucent; it occurs in roundish masses imbedded in dolomite with mica, at Passecken near Tamsweg, in Salzburg, (c) Oosite (Oosit Marx, ib., iii. 216, 1834), another related compound (anal. 43), is white to reddish or brownish-red, and occurs in 6- and 12-sided prisms ; it is from the Oos valley, duchy of Baden, occurring in what ia called pinite-porphyry. (d) Gongylite (Gongylit Thoreld, Act. Soc. Sci. Fenn., iii. 815, A. Nord., Beskrifn. Find. Min., 146, 1855) is yellowish or yellowish-brown, and has cleavage in two directions; with H. =4\u2014 5; G.=2*7 ; anal. 42. From a schist called talcose schist at Kimsamo in Finland.

On the same specimen is found true translucent el\u00e6olite, affording only 1-3 p. c. of water on calcination, and entirely solu ble in dilute acids ; by the side of this, red spots where alteration has commenced ; and beyond, the mineral changed to a brick-red uniform material, mostly opaque, with some trans lucent spots of unaltered el\u00e6olite. This red material afforded 5'9 p. c. of water, and dissolved only partially in dilute nitric acid, leaving an abundant red deposit.

Obs. \u2014 Tufas are formed through the action of waters, and often that of heated waters or steam accompanying an eruption of lavas, on the granulated volcanic rock, or volcanic sand ; aud in the process the protoxyd of iron of the pyroxene of the rock becomes more or less completely changed to sesquioxyd, and water is taken up, and so the palagonite is produced. As the volcanic rock is made up generally of pyroxene and a feldspar always in very variable proportions, uniformity in such results of alteration is not possible. Bunsen observes that palagonite is the basis of the basaltic tufas of Germany, France, Azores, Canaries, Cape Verdes, Tortugas, and probably also of those of the Pacific Islands. Mdanhydritt (anal. 14, by Wackernagel, 1. c, and Ramm. Min. Ch.) is velvet-black to brownish-black, and occurs in irregular nodules in a decomposed wacke at Schmelzerthal near Honnef, on the Rhine.

Lustre of surface of basal cleavage pearly to waxy, glimmering. Color grayish-green, to greenish-brown, olive- or oil-green ; sometimes blackish-green to black ; streak colorless. Var. \u2014 This species is a result of alteration; and considerable variation in the results of analyses should be expected. The crystalline form is that of the original iolite, while the basal cleavage when distinct is that of the new species fahlunite. 1. Triclasiie and fahlunite were from the same locality, Fahlun, Sweden. The mineral has the above characters. Bonsdorffite and auralite are Bonsdorff's Hydrous iolite, from Abo, Finland, and identical with fahlunite. The name triclasite alludes to three cleavages, and is therefore bad, as they are not cleavages of the species, but in part of the original iolite. Fahlunite dates from the same year. Esmarkite is fahlunite. Color grayish-green to whitish, with a greasy lustre. G.=2'709; H.=3*5. (b) Praseolite is similar from Brakke, near Brevig, in granite. H.=3*5 ; G.=2*754. (c) Raumite, from Raumo in Finland, is of like nature and origin, according to A. E. Nor denskiold (Beskrifn. Finl. Min.), although analysis gives a somewhat different constitution. (d) Chlorophyllite from Unity, Maine, is like faldunite in composition, etc. ; H. on base of prisms=l*5\u2014 3 ; G. = 2'705. Named from green, and ipiWau, leaf, (e) Peploliie from Rams berg, Sweden, has the composition essentially and form of esmarkite; G. = 2*68 \u2014 2*75. 2. Pyrargillite is near fahlunite, and probably essentially the same, though containing more water and less of protoxyd bases. Form the same, but cleavage not distinct ; color blackish, bluish, liver-brown, or in part dull-red; H.=3-5; G. = 2*5; lustre weak resinous. It is from granite near Helsingfors, Finland. Bisehof has shown that it is only altered iolite. 3. Polychroilite has been referred here. It occurs in six-sided prisms of 120\u00b0, without distinct cleavage. H.=3\u2014 3-5; lustre greasy ; color blue and green of different shades, and also brown and brick-red. Occurs in gneiss at Krageroe, Norway. 4. Aspasiolite occurs in prisms like those of fahlunite, but with the cleavage less distinct ; H.= 3\u20143'5; G. = 2-764; color green to greenish-gray, eiouded with brown or red. It is from Kra geroe, Norway, with iolite in quartz. Huronite Thomson (Min., i. 384, 1836). Considered an altered mineral near fahlunite, by T. S. Hunt. Occurs in spherical masses in hornblendic boulders in the vicinity of Lake Huron. Struc ture partly in imperfect folia, and partly granular. H. = 3 \u2014 3-5; G. = 2'86; lustre waxy to pearly ; color light yellowish-green ; subtranslucent.

Gigantolite and Iberite much resemble fahlunite, and like it are results of the alteration of iolite, occurring in large six to twelve-sided crystals.

This species appears to be often, if not always, a result of the hydration of muscovite, there being all shades of gradation between it and that species. Muscovite has the O. ratio for bases and silica of 4 : 5, or nearly ; and the deficiency of base for a unisilicate here indicated appears to be the source of its tendency to take up water, the water passing iu to supply it.

Comp., Var. \u2014 The amorphous mineral substances here included are results of the alteration of rhodonite, in which the manganese passes from the state of protoxyd to that of sesquioxyd, and other changes take place through the presence of any ingredients in the altering infiltrating waters. A uniformity of composition is not therefore to be expected, and much doubt must exist as to the reality of the species which any chemical analyses may seem to indicate. The most recent analyses (anal. 2 to 5 below) have a correspondence in oxygen ratio which appears to show that there is among them at least one true hydrous silicate of manganese, and that it is related in composition to hisingerite. The 0. ratio for fi+fi, Si, fl, in analysis 2 is 12-69 : 19-11 : 14-32 ; 3, 11-56 : 18-69 : 14-86; 4, 12-11 : 19*09 : 14-02; 5, 13-04 : 18-34 : 1544; each of which corres pond quite nearly to 2 : 3 : 2J, and to the general hisingerite formula, (R3, fi)2 5i3-|-3 aq, in which two-fifths of the water is made basic. Neolocite (anal. 4, 5) is here included by A. E. Nordenskiold along with stratopeite, and good authority appears thus to be given for setting a *ide the older analysis of it by Igelstrom (anal. 6). In slralopeile, G. = 2-64, according to Igelstrom; in neotocite and wiiiingite, G. = 2*7 \u2014 2-8, according to N. Nordenskiold. Bahr's and Svanberg's analyses, 9-12, give a different composition, as the manganese is made sesquioxyd; but new determinations are required before these, or the analyses of wittingite. can be taken as representing distinct chemical compounds. Bahr writes for analyses 9, 10, 11, Sin2 Si3+3fi; and for anal. 12, obtains the O. ratio for R+fi, Si, fl, 13-9 : 17-6 : 8-5.

Tabergite, from Taberg, Wermland (Blue talc of Werner, and called also micorcltlorite), is a bluish-green or green chlorite. According to Deseloizeaux's optical observations, it is in part uni axial, with the axis positive like true penninite. But in other cases uniaxial and biaxial plates are combined, and negative and positive also ; and the axial divergence of the biaxial plates varies from 1\u00b0 to 33\u00b0, indicating a mixture of penninite and another chlorite, either pyrosclerite or ripidolite. Crystals of Texas have the double refraction positive though feeble (Descl., Cooke) : they are often mixed with ripidolite, and sometimes a crystal is traversed by a band of ripidolite, whose optic-axial angle is 60 3 to 70\u00b0 (Descl.). 3. Kammererite. The original specimen was a reddish-violet micaceous mineral from L. Itknl in Bissersk, in Perm, Russia, partly in 6-sided prisms. It was named after Kammerer of Russia. Rhodophyllite of Genth, and chrom-chlorite of Herm. (anal. 1 2), are the same, from Texas, Pa. ; G.= 2*617\u20142-62. Rhodochrome is a compact or scaly-granular variety, originally from L. Itkul, Siberia, having a splintery fracture, with G. = 2-66\u2014 2-67. Color deep green; but violet, rose- or peach blossom-red in thin splinters, whence the name. 4. Loganite of Hunt (=Pseudophite of Kenngott) is near penninite in composition. A notice of loganite, from Calumet Falls, Canada, is given under Altered Hornblende (p. 242), as it has the form, angles, and cleavage of that species ; and also of an allied material under niltered Pyroxene (p. 221). It has G.=2*60 \u2014 2*64; color clove-brown to chocolate-brown ; lustre dull. Pseudophite of Kenngott (Ber. Ak. Wien, xvi. 1855) has the composition of loganite, but is compact massive, without cleavage, and resembles serpentine (whence the name, from tjcSpJoV, false, and ophite or serpentine); H.=2*5; G.=2-75 \u2014 2-77 ; lustre weak; color grayish-green, olive-green, pistachio-green ; feel unctuous. It forms the gangue of enstatite (Mg Si) at Zdjar in Aloysthal, Moravia. In the occurrence of a massive form, penninite is thus like talc, pyrophyl lite, and other related species. Descloizeaux found (Min., 436) R A R=65\u00b0 28' in penninite, and 0 A .ff=103o 45'; and the latter in the Texas kammererite. The above angles, and figs. 414, 415, are from Cooke's paper on the latter (Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 201), and f. 41 6 is from Kokscharof (Verh. Jlin. Ges. St. Pet., 1851). Comp. \u2014 0. ratio for bases and silica 4 : 3, corresponding to 8 (Mg3, Si), 9 Si, 12 fl, but vary ing from 4 : 3 to 5 : 4. Exact deductions from the analyses cannot be made until the state ol oxydation of the iron in all cases is ascertained ; and, further, until it is also proved that there may not be a crystalline mixture such as is mentioned above under tabergite. The mineral often contains microscopic grains of magnetite, and these are supposed by Kenngott to occasion some of the discrepancies in the analyses.

In the U. States, in large crystals and plates at Westchester, in serpentine, and Unionville, Pa. (f. 424); at Texas, with chromite, and intimately associated, and sometimes compounded, with red and green penninite. On cryst. see Kokscharof, Min. Russi., ii. 7 (abstract in Am. J.

Named ripidolite from puns, a fan, in allusion to a common mode of pgrouping of the crystals; and clinochlore, from the inclined monoclinic form of crystallization ascertained by Blake's optical investigation. It has since been found, and first through examinations by Kokscharof, that the chlorite of Achmatovsk, and also that of Schwarzenstein and Ala, the three upon which von Kobell based his description of ripidolite, are also monoclinic, and identical with clinochlore. Ripidolite has nevertheless been, to some extent, set aside for clinochlore, because of the confusion in the science connected with that name (see p. 502); but the latter name is very objectionable, since there is now a second monoclinic chlorite known (p. 504). The former name is a register of von Kobeh's important chemical discovery that the old chlorite included two distinct species (p. 502), and ought to be retained. Talc-Celorite op Teaversella occurs in large hexagonal plates regularly grouped, and presents, according to Descloizeaux, the optical characters of clinochlore. The plates are twins, consisting of six triangular sections ; at centre they are translucent and blackish-green, and have a negative bisectrix, and exteriorly clear green and transparent, with a positive bisectrix. Marig nac regards it as between talc and chlorite. He obtained (Ann. Ch. Phys., III. xiv. 60, 1845) \u25a0 Si Si Fe fig fl 1. 3845 1175 12-82 28-19 849=9970. 2. 39-81 12-56 11-10 2841 779=99-67. 3. 4L34 1142 10-09 29'67 7-66=10048. Corresponds nearly with the O. ratio 3:1:4:3, and therefore the general formula (R3, fi)5 Sis + aq, or that ot pyrosclerite. But it is possibly ripidolite impure from mixture with talc, which view would account for the high percentage of silica. Occurs at Traversella, Piedmont, with magnetite and ripidolite. At Traversella there is still another talc-chlorite, soft and of a silvery-white lustre, having a single optical axis, or two very slightly divergent ; the hexagonal plates are opaque at centre and transparent toward the borders. It affords much water in a matrass, and fuses with difficulty on the edges to a white enamel. 451. LEUCHTENBERGITE. Leuchtenbergit Komonen, Verh. Min.

Sept Lacs in Dauphiny (anal. 7) ; in Styria ; Bohemia. Also massive in Cornwall, in tin veins (where it is called peach) ; at Arendal in Norway ; Salberg and Dannemora, Sweden ; Dognacska, Hungary ; also as pseudomorphs, at Bergmannsgriin, Saxony, after garnet, and at Greiner, Tyrol, after hornblende. Grengesite from Grangesberg in Dalecarlia, Sweden (anal. 12), occurs partly in hexagonal crystalli zations, more or less radiately grouped, and probably results, Erdmann observes (Larobok Min., 1853, 374), from the alteration of pyroxene. Erdmann spells the name Grdngesile. Specific gravity 3*1 j color dark green. Reported also from Fischbachtbal, as altered augite, in mela phyre. Named from yXupii, green. Werner's species chlorite was shown to include more than one species by von Kobell in 1838, and the name chlorite was thereupon given by him to the St Gothard and other chlorites having 25 to 27 p. c. sihca, and ripidolite to that of Schwarzenstein and Achmatovsk having 30 to 33 p. c. of silica. Iu 1839, G. Rose reversed the names of v. Kobell (see paper on chlorite by Varrentrapp, Pogg, xlviii. 193, 1839) on the ground that v. Kobell's ripidolite was not so characteristically fan-shaped in aggregation as the other species. But the change was unfortunate, as both species are now known to differ but little in this respect, and it has resulted in much confusion in the science. Moreover, it violated an older claim of priority; for Werner's bldttriger Chlorit (or Chlorites lamel losus), the first crystallized chlorite recognized by him (in 1800 or earlier, Ludwig's Min., L 118, 1803), was the hexagonal chlorite of St. Gothard, and this should therefore, in the division, have retained the name chlorite. As the term chlorite has become the designation of a family of minerals, it seems necessary that it should have some modified form for this species, and hence the application of prochlorite, from jTppj, before, and chlorite, in allusion to its being the earliest crystallized kind recognized. The following are chlorite-like minerals of doubtful nature : 453. A Chlorite-like mineral from Webster, N. C, in crystals, micaceous in structure, of a dark bluish to brownish-green color, afforded Genth (Am. J. Sci., II. xxxiii 200) : Si Si \u20acr Ee Ni fig Ca fl fl 3145 13-08 4-16 4-88 0-16 43-10 047 0-06 3*29 = 100*35. The ratio between the oxygen of the bases and silica is about 3:2. It is remarkable for the small amount of water and iron, and the large proportion of magnesia ; a constitution which may have an explanation in its being a mixture of talc and chlorite. It is associated with a talc which Genth found to be nearly anhydrous (p. 453). 454. Aphrosiderite Sandberger (Ueb. Geol. Nassau, 97, 1847). A soft ferruginous chlorite, of a dark olive-green color, scaly massive in structure ; the scales minute, transparent, and hexagonal, and having G.=2\"8 and H. = l ; from \"Weilburg, Duchy of Nassau, at the Gelegenheit mine.

Phyllite (and ottrelite) closely resembles chloritoid, as observed by Hunt (Am. J. Sci., II. xxxi.), and also by Descloizeaux (Jlin., i. 466). The analyses hitherto made, however, show a wide discrepancy. Yet it should be noted on this point that we have only one of each variety, and the mineral is so involved in the containing slate rock that it is very difficult to obtain it pure. Occurs in small, oblong, shining scales or plates, more or less hexagonal in argillaceous schist.

The scales are from -{j-J in. long, and half to one-third this broad. Ottrelite is from a similar rock near Ottrez, on the borders of Luxembourg, and from Ardennes. Phyllite has also been reported from Tus cany. Descloizeaux remarks on the close resemblance of the ottrelite of Ardennes to the New port phyllite, and Hunt on the same to the Canada chloritoid. 459.

The seybertite was discovered in 1828 by Messrs. Fitch, JIather, and Horton, and named clin toniie by them on the spot, after De Witt Clinton, as stated by Mather in his Rep. Geol. N. Y., 1843. But the name was not published at the time by either of the discoverers; and Finch, the next year, 1829 (1. a), announced the mineral under the name of bronzite. Clemson's name sey bertite, after H. Seybert (1832, L c), has therefore priority of publication, and must be accepted as the name of the species. APPENDIX TO HYDROUS SILICATES. 462. WOLCHONSKOITE. Kammerer, Jahrb. Min., ii. 420, 1831.

Number 1 is the Ferrotantalite of Thomson ; 1 and 2, the Sideroiantalite of Hausmann ; 3, the Cassiterotanialite and Ixiolite. The kinds shade into one another. The last has the lo -.est specific gravity, G.=7\u2014 7-3. The mineral varies in the state of oxydation ofthe bases, owing, as Rose has shown, to alteration of the protoxyds to sesquioxyds ; with the increase of the latter the streak loses its black color. It varies also in O. ratio for bases and acid between 1 : 4 and 1 : 5. The latter corresponds to Tantalic acid 86*05, protoxyd of iron 13*9i>, and the former to 83-1 and 16-9. Rose finds that prolonged washing of the powdered mineral carries off the iron.

Tantalic and columbic acids were formerly supposed to contain either 3 or 2 of oxygen, and a hypotantalic and a hypocolumbic were recognized.

With salt of phosphorus dis solves slowly, giving an iron glass, which in R.F., if free from tungstic acid, i3 pale yellow on cooling ; treated with tin on charcoal it becomes green. If tungstic acid is present the bead is dark red, and is unchanged in color when treated with tin on charcoal. With soda and nitre gives a green ish-blue manganese reaction. On charcoal, with soda and sufficient borax to dissolve the oxyd of iron, gives in R.F. metallic tin. Decomposed on fusion with bisulphate of potash in the platinum spoon, and gives on treatment with dilute muriatic acid a yellow solution and a heavy white pow der, which, on addition of metallic zinc, assumes a smalt-blue color ; on dilution with water the blue color soon disappears (v. Kobell). Obs. \u2014 Tantalite is confined mostly to albite or oligoclase granite, and is usually associated with beryl. Near Hiirkasaari, tantalite is associated with rose quartz and gigantolite, in albitic granite. At Katiala it is associated with lepidolite, black tourmaline, and colorless beryl. Occurs in Finland, in Tammela, at Harkiisaari near Torro, associated with gigantolite and rose quartz ; in Kimito at Skogbule, in Somero at Kaidasuo, and in Kuortane at Katiala, with lepidolite, tourmaline, and beryl ; in Sweden, in Fahlun, at Broddbo and Finbo ; iu France, at Chanteloube near Limoges, in pegmatite. Ixiolite, from Kimito, was instituted on a supposed (not real) differ ence of crystalline form. Ildefonsite is from Ildefonso, Spain, and has G. = 7*416, H. = 6\u2014 7. Named Tantalite by Ekeberg, from the mythic Tantalus, in playful allusion to the difficulties (tantalizing) he encountered in his attempts to make a solution of the Finland mineral in acids. The' name was afterward extended to the American mineral columbite, and to the same from other localities ; while the name columbite, the metal columbium having been discovered a little prior to tantalum, received a similar extension, so as to include all tantalite. The subsequent discovery that tantalum and columbium were distinct metals, aud that the two compounds differed also in the atomic proportions of the constituents, finally established them as independent species. 474.

Von Kobell states that when decomposed by fusion with caustic potash, and treated with muriatic and sulphuric acids, it gives, on the addition of zinc, a blue color much more lasting than with tantalite; and the variety dianite, when similarly treated, gives, on boiling with tin-foil, and dilution with its volume of water, a sapphire-blue fluid, while, with tantalite and ordinary columbite, the metallic acid remains undissolved. The variety from Had dam, Ct., is partially decomposed when the powdered mineral is evaporated to dryness with con centrated sulphuric acid, its color is changed to white, light gray, or yellow, and when boiled with muriatic acid and metallic zinc it gives a beautiful blue. The remarkably pure and unaltered columbite from Arksut-fiord in Greenland is also partially decomposed by sulphuric acid, and the product gives the reaction test with zinc, as above. Obs. \u2014 Occurs at Rabenstein, Bavaria, near Zwiesel, not far from Bodenmais, in granite, with iolite and magnetite; at Tirschenreuth, Bavaria; at Tammela, in Finland; at Chanteloube, neaT Limoges, in pegmatite with tantalite; near Miask, in the Ilmen Mts., with samarskite; at Her manskar, near Bjorskar, in Finland; in Greenland, in cryolite, at Evigtok, in brilliant crystals; disseminated through or among the wolfram of Auvergne, and detected by acting with aqua-regia, which dissolves the wolfram and leaves untouched tho columbite (Phipson, Chem. News, 1867, 160); at Jlonte Video, S. A. In the United States, at Haddam, 2 m. from the village, in a granite vein, some of the crystals several pouuds in weight ; also at the chrysoberyl locality, but not now accessible ; also at the iolite locality, Haddam ; near Middletown, iu the \" feldspar \" or \" china-stone quarry,\" with albite, abundant in fine crystals some very large ; figure 429 represents one f in. long ; another, de scribed by Professor Johnston (Am. J. Sei, xxx. 387), weighed, before it was broken, 14 pounds; and the part figured about 6 in. in length and breadth, weighed 6 lbs. 12 oz.; it exhibits the faces i-i, i-i, i-2, I, i-3, }s-i, and another imperfect plane, which appears to bo 1-3. At Chesterfield, Jlass., some fine crystals, associated with blue and green tourmalines and beryl, in a vein of albitic granite; Acworth, N. H.; also Beverly, Jlass. ; Northfield, Mass., with beryl; Plymouth. N. H., with beryl; Greenfield, N. Y, with chrysoberyl. The Connecticut crystals are usually rather fragile from partial change ; while those of Green laud are very firm and hard. The occurrence of columbite iu America was first made known by Mr. Hatchett's examination of a specimen sent by Governor Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloane, then President of the Royal Society, which was labelled as found at Neatneague. Dr. S. L. Jlitchill stated (Med. Repos., vol. viii.) that it was taken at a spring at New London, Conn. No locality has since been detected at that place. But the rediscovery of it at Haddam, first published by Dr. Torrey (Am. J. Sci., iv. 52), and since near Jliddletown, about 7 m. distant, has led to the belief that the original locality was at one of these places, which are about 30 m. W. of New London. Por recent papers on cryst. see Descl, Ann. d. M., V. viii. 395 ; Schrauf, Ber. Ak. Wien, xliv. 445, 1861; Jlaskelyne, Phil. Jlag., IV. xxv. 41. The crystallographic identity of the American mineral with the Bavarian was first shown by Dr. J. Torrey (Ann. Lye. N. Y., i. 89, 1824). The metal of columbite was named columbium by Hatchett in 1802, from Columbia, a name of America, whence his specimen was received, and thus came the name columbite given by Jameson and Thomson (see further under tantalite). Rose, after investigating the metal and its compounds, named it anew, calling it niobium, and this gave rise to the name niobite. \u25a0 Baierite is from the German name of Bavaria. Torrelite Thomson, named after Dr. J. Torrey, is the ordinary Middle town columbite: and Greenlandite Breith., is that from Greenland; both names originated partly hi erroneous views of the crystals of the minerals. Dianite is the Bodenmais columbite, iu whicli v. Kobell supposed he had discovered the acid of a new metal, which he called dianium. No good reason has been given for substituting niobium for columbium ; and yet most English chemists, as well as European, have thus far followed Rose in rejecting the name given by th( English discoverer. The rule of priority demands recognition. 475. TAPIOLITE. Tapiolit A. E. Nordenskiold, \u0152fv. Ak. Stockh., 443, 1863. Tantalite (ft Sukula) Arppe, Act. Soc. Sei.

When decomposed by fusion with caustic potash, and subsequently treated with water, and this solution neutralized with muriatic acid, it gives a precipitate, which, boiled with concentrated muriatic acid and tin-foil, gives a clear sapphire-blue fluid, which changes to an olive-green, and finally bleaches. If the residue of the fusion after leaching is treated with muriatic acid and boiled ivith tin-foil, it yields on dilution a pale rose-red color (v. Kobell). The mineral is sufficiently attacked, ou evaporation with sulphuric acid, to give a whitish residue, which, treated with metallic zinc or tin, affords the characteristic blue reduction test.

Comp., Var.\u2014 Varies much in composition, according to the anal- yses, like other columbium minerals, and probably as a result of alter ation. The description above given is from (1) the Greenland fergusonite. 2. A mineral from Ytterby, according to Nordenskiold, is very similar in its hemihedral crystal lization and form, but contains 6 p. c. of water (anal. 3, 4) ; as pyrochlore is sometimes hydrous, this peculiarity may be one of the effects of alteration. It has an imperfect basal cleavage ; a vit reous to greasy lustre ; a dark brown color ; H.=4*5; G.=4*89; and is feebly subtranslucent 3. Tyrite Forbes (Ed. N. Phil. J., i. 67, 1855, aud Phil. Mag., IY. xiii. 91) occurs in square pyramidal crystals like those of fergusonite, and sometimes 2 inches long, with occasionally, ac cording to Kenngott, planes corresponding to O, 1, 3, *5, and hemihedral ; but with the faces too uneven for exact measurement. It has oue cleavage distinct, and traces of two others ; color brownish-black; H.=6*5; G.=543\u2014 5-56, Forbes; 5*555, Kenngott. It contains water, but approaches fergusonite in composition (aual. 5, 6). It is from Hampemyr and Helle, near Arendal, Norway, and the crystals often stand on plates of black mica. 4. A mineral from the Norwegian locality of tyrite, and supposed to be that species (the speci men having been sent as such from Krantz to H. Rose), has been analyzed with still different results by J. Potyka (Pogg., cvii. 590), he finding in it 7 p. c. of potash (anaL 7). It was an irregular mass imbed led in reddish feldspar, had no cleavage, a submetallic lustre, a black color, reddish-brown at tho edges in thin splinters, a reddish-brown streak, and H. =4, G.=5424. This last mineral, the tyrite, the Ytterby mineral, and fergusonite, may be four distinct species, but it does not appear probable."], [581, "TANTALATES, COLUMBATES. 525 5. Bragite of Forbes and Dahl, from Helle, Narcsto, Alve, and AskerS, Norway, has been re ferrel to fergusonite by J. A. Jlichaelson (J. pr. Ch., xc. 108). F. & D. describe the mineral as tetragonal, with H.=6\u2014 6*5 ; G.=543 \u2014 5*36; color brown; streak yellowish-brown ; lustre sub metallic ; thin splinters translucent ; and as losing water when heated ; but infusible B.B., and becoming yellow ; and as affording, with salt of phosphorus, a skeleton of silica ; characters which suggest a relation to hydrous or altered zircon, where it is placed on p. 276.

The Ytterby mineral also affords very closely the ratio 1:1; tyrite about 9:11; Potyka's mineral 9 : 9|, or very nearly 1 : 1.

Decomposed by soda without dissolving, leaving a reddish slag ; with soda on charcoal affords globules of metallic tin (Berzelius). When evaporated with sulphuric acid yields a white residue, which, treated with muriatic acid and metallic zinc, gives a bluish-green color Tyrite decrepitates and yields much water in the closed tube (Forbes). Obs. \u2014 Fergusonite was discovered by Giesecke, near Cape Earewell in Greenland, disseminated in quartz, and named after Robert Ferguson of Raith.

PHOSPHATES, ARSENATES, ANTIMONATES. In the anhydrous Phosphates and Arsenates the hardness is from 3 to 6 ; colors various, comprising, besides white or colorless, shades of green, yellow, blue, brown, violet, black, several of them bright ; crystalline forms of each of the systems, except the isometric. The hydrous species have a still wider range of crystallization and colors, including the isometric system in the former, and reddish shades among the latter ; while the limits of hardness are lower, being between 1 and 5 ; a much larger pro portion of the species are clinohedral. In composition, the oxygen ratio for bases and acid which is far the most common, is 3 : 5 ; next to this"], [583, "527 ANHYDKOUS PHOSPHATES AND AKSENATES. 6:5; the ratios 2 : 3, 4 : 5, 3 : 2 are rare ; while 1 : 1 is unknown, except problematically in two or three species of doubtful composition. The pyrognostic reactions for phosphates B.B. are the following: If the acid is combined with a base which of itself imparts no color to the flame, it will give a characteristic bluish-green color, and this may be made more intense by moistening with sulphuric acid before ignition. If the phosphate is soluble in nitric acid, the dilute solution will give with acetate of lead a white precipitate, which after washing yields B.B. on charcoal in R.F. a crystalline polyhedral bead of phosphate of lead. Further, according to Bunsen, if a phosphate, or a substance containing but a small amount of phosphoric acid, be heated in a wide closed glass tube, with three parts of dry soda and a small fragment of sodium, it is on fusion converted into a phosphid, which after cooling yields phosphuretted hydrogen when moistened with water. Most phosphates in the state of powder are reduced to phosphids by simple fusion with sodium. Arsenates are easily recognized by the alliaceous odor given when treated on charcoal, especially when fused with soda. I. ANHYDROUS. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SPECIES. I.

There is a sneer at the great Swedish chemist in the name, which should have occasioned its immediate rejection. Fortunately the word was misspelt from the first ; and in its accepted form may be regarded as referring to the fact that the crystals are small, rare, not showy, aud were long unnoticed. 491.

Affords the reaction of phosphorio acid and also of cerium, pro- ducing, however, with borax and salt of phosphorus, a glass which is pale violet-blue when cold. either due to the presence of didymium or a minute portion of cobalt ore. Obs.\u2014 Cryptolite occurs in the green and red apatite of Arendal, Norway, and is discovered on putting tho apatite in dilute nitric acid; constitutes 2 or 3 p. c. of the mass ; it was found espe cially in the red apatite, or in reddish points of the green, and associated with particles of mag netic iron, hornblende, and another cerium ore of a hyacinth-red color, supposed to be monazite. This mineral was looked for in the yellowish apatites of Snarum without success. Occurs also with apatite in the Tyrol (?); and in the apatite of the Sliidianka in Siberia. Phosphocerite, according to Watts and Chapman, may be the grayish-yellow powder in the cobalt ore of Tunaberg. The crystalline forms most common in the powder are an octahedron and a square or rectangular prism, terminating in a four-sided pyramid parallel with the lateral planes, resembling fig. 248*, under zircon. Genth has observed a mineral, probably cryptolite, in the Hurdstown apatite. Named from upv-nros, concealed. 34"], [586, "530 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 492. APATITE. Crystallized from Spain.

The earliest examination of apatite was that of Proust, in 1788 (1. a), on the phosphorite of Estremadura, which led him to call it a calcareous phosphate; and that of Klaproth, in the same year (1. c), on the Saxon apatite, in which he found 3? 45, Ca 55. Pelletier in 1 790 (1. c.) made a complete, although not entirely accurate, analysis of the phosphorite, detecting even the fluo rine and chlorine, obtaining P 34, Ca 59, fluoric acid 2*5, muriatic acid 0-5, te 1. Si 2, C 1= 100. The asparagus stone of Spain was not analyzed until 1798, by Vauquelin (1. a): he found only phosphoric acid and lime, respectively 45*72 and 54*28 p. c. His results proved its iden tity with the Saxon mineral, and from this time they were united, along with phosphorite, undei Werner's name of apatite, first given in 1786 to tlie Saxon mineral. Forbes found in the eupyrchroite (Phil. Mag., IV. xxix. 340) P 44*12. Phosphorite of different localities has afforded a trace of iodine, and that from Amberg gave H. Reinsch in addition a trace of bromine. Apatite from Krageroe, according to Volcker (anal. 11), contains uo fluorine. That of Jumilla afforded de Luna 1-75 p. c. of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium. Near Coquimbo, Chili, at the mines of Tambillos, occur clear turquois-blue crystals, containing, according to F. Field (Chem. Gaz., No. 400, 1860, p. 224), P 37*69, Ca 36-64, Cu 20-93 CaCl 2-33, fl 2*32=99*91, the copper being present as phosphate. Lechartier has shown (C. R., lxv. 172) that an arsenic acid apatite may be made by fusion together of arsenate of lime and chlorid of calcium ; and that from the same at a lower tempera ture an arsenic acid wagnerite is obtained in crystals. Pyr., etc \u2014 B.B. in the forceps fuses with difficulty on the edges (F.=4*5\u2014 5), coloring the flame reddish-yellow; moistened with sulphuric acid and heated colors the flame pale bluish-green (phosphoric acid): some varieties react for chlorine with salt of phosphorus, when the bead has been previously saturated with oxyd of copper, while others give fluorine when fused with this salt in an open glass tube. Gives a phosphid with the sodium test. Dissolves in muriatic and nitric acid, yielding with sulphuric acid a copious precipitate of sulphate of lime ; the dilute nitric acid solution gives with acetate of lead a white precipitate, which B.B. on charcoal fuses, giviug a globule with crystalline facets on cooling. Some varieties of apatite phosphoresce on heating. Obs. \u2014 Apatite occurs in rocks of various kinds aud ages, but is most common in metamorphic crystalline rocks, especially in granular limestone, granitic and many metalliferous veins, particu larly those of tin, in gneiss, syenite, hornblendic gneiss, mica schist, beds of iron ore ; occasion ally ill serpentine, and in igneous or volcanic rocks ; sometimes in ordinary stratified limestone, beds of sandstone or shale of the Silurian, Carbouiferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, or Tertiary forma tions. It has been observed as the petrifying material of wood. Among its localities are Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony.

The asparagus stone or spargelstein of Jumilla, in Murcia (not C. de Gata), Spain, is pale yellowish-green in color ; and a variety from Zillerthal is wine-yellow. The phosphorite, or massive radiated variety, is obtained abundantly near the junction of granite and argillite, in Estrema dura, Spain ; at Schlackenwald in Bohemia ; at Krageroe, whence it has been largely exported to England; at Amberg, in Jurassic limestone, nodular and stalactitic.

Phosphatic nodules occur in many fossiliferous rocks, which are probably in all cases of organic origin. They sometimes present a spiral or other interior structure, derived from the animal organization that afforded them, and in such cases their coprolitic origin is unquestionable.

Guano is bone-phosphate of lime, or osteolite, mixed with the hydrous phos phate, brushit.e, and generally witli some carbonate of lime, and often a little magnesia, alumina, iron, silica, gypsum, and other impurities. It often contains 9 or 10 p. c. of water. It is often granular or oolitic ; also compact through consolidation produced by infiltrating waters, iu which case it is frequently lamellar in structure, and also occasionally stalagmitic and stalactitic. Its colors are usually grayish-white, yellowish and dark brown, and sometimes reddish, and the lustre of a surface of fracture earthy to resinous. Shepard's Pyroclasite (Am. J. Sci., II. xxii. 97) is nothiug but the hard guano from Monk's Island, Caribbean sea, the mass of which he named Pyro guantte, under the wrong idea of its having undergone the action of heat ; and Phipson's Sombre rite (J. Ch. Soc, xv. 277, 1862) is the same thing from Sombrero, as shown by A. A. Juiien (Am. J. Sci., II. xxxvi. 423). The waters which have filtrated through the guano at Sombrero have altered the coral rock adjoining, turning it more or less completely into phosphate of lime of a yellowish or brownish color ; and phosphatic stalagmites and stalactites resinous in fracture are common. Shepard's massive Glaubapatite, yellowish-brown to chocolate-brown in color, and in fibrous sta lactites, from Monk's Island (1. a), is also in all probability merely the guano rock above described. He says the mineral contains 15*1 p. c. of sulphate of soda, with 74'0 of phosphate of Mine, ans 10*3 of water; but such a compound is hardly a possibility, and the fact of its existence needs confirmation. The name, from glauber and apatite, alludes to the composition. The mineral includes also \"tabular crystals,\" 'which may possibly be brushite, although the composition is against it. 492E.

According to Richter it fuses with much difficulty, and affords indications of phosphoric acid, lime, protoxyd of iron, alumina, and a very little silica ; not tested for fluorine or chlorine, becauso of too little material. Occurs with garnets aud graphite in a crystalline rock, but locality unknown. 492F. Talc- apatite Hermann (J. pr. Ch., xxxi. 101). An apatite from chlorite slate in the Schischimskian mountains, near Slatoust, containing a large percentage of magnesia in place of part ofthe lime, and low in specific gravity. It occurs in 6-sided prisms, grouped or single : H.=5 ; G.=2'7 \u2014 2'75; lustre dull to earthy ; color milk-white, yellowish externally ; feebly translucent.

Berzelius suggests that the magnesia may have come from the gangue. According to Volger it is an altered impure apatite. Some magnesia is present in many apatites (Bisehof.). 492 G.

It occurs near Slatoust in the Ilmen Mtn., in granite, along with flesh-red feldspar; also near the river Sanarka, in the Ural; near Notero in Norway (urdite), in crystals sometimes 1 in. across ; at Schreiberhau, with gado linite, (G-.=4-9). In the United States it is found in small crystals from -,\\- to f- in. long, with the sillimanite of Norwich, and sparingly with the same mineral at Chester, Ct. A few minute crystals (eremite of Shepard) were found in a boulder of albitic granite, containing also a few minute zircons aud tourmalines, in the northeastern part of Watertown, Ct.

Alt. \u2014 Triphylite and triplite, like other minerals containing protoxyd of manganese, undergo easy alteration by oxydation and hydration ; and the former also by losing its alkalies. The ses quioxyd of iron in Wittstein's analysis (anal. 5) is thus accounted for. The following have come from the alteration of one or the other of these minerals. A. Heterosite.

It is stated to have a rather perfect basal cleavage ; a brachydiagonal little distinct ; -and a prips matic parallel to a prism of 1 29\u00b0 very imperfect. Alt. \u2014 Often occurs coated with oxyd of manganese as a result of its alteration. 600. HOPEITE. Brewster, Trans. R. Soc. Edinb., x. 107, 1825.

B.B. gives out water, and then melts with difficulty to a clear colorless globule, tinging the flame green. The globule obtained with borax remains clear on cooling. With soda it affords a scoria which is yellow when hot, and gives out copious fumes of zinc and some of cadmium. The fused min eral forms a fine blue glass with a solution of cobalt. Hopeite is supposed, therefore, to be a hydrous compound of phosphoric acid and oxyd of zinc, with a small portion of cadmium. N. Nordenskiold, Jahresb., v. 198, 1825. Obs. \u2014 Found in the calamine mines of Altenberg, near Aix la Chapelle. Named in honor of Prof. Hope of Edinburgh. The angle of i-i A 4-T in hopeite is near i-2 A i-2 in fischerite. 601.

Alt. \u2014 The crystals of metabrushite from Sombrero are often hollow from the removal of the interior, and otherwise altered. Julien describes the following varieties : 1. H. = 3*25. G.=2*971. The crust of the hollow crystals thin, and surfaces within and with out often coated by minute rhombs of calcite; the zeugite of Julien. 2. Crust rather thicker, without a glittering surface of calcite rhombs. 3.

Ornithite of Julien, from Sombrero (1 c, p. 377), appears also to be altered metabrushite, its crystals presenting the same forms and habit, but usually quite small and very thin parallel to the orthodiagonal ; also sometimes thin parallel to the clinodiagonal, and acute rhombic in section ; angle i-i A -l-i=about 38\u00b0 ; H.=2-5.

There occur also hemispherical stellated groups of white crystals, as altered ornithite, which Mr. Julien has not analyzed, but supposed to be the same compound minus the water. One crystal of the so-called ornithite examined by the author had on its edges and surface microscopic tufts of acicular crystals. Epiglaubile and crystallized Glaubapatite of Shepard (Am. J. Sci., n. xxii. 96, 1856). One or the other of these may be metabrushite or brushite. Glaubapatite has already been remarked upon on page 535. It may be added that there is further proof that no such guano compound exists (combination of sulphate of soda and phosphate of lime) in that A. A. Julien has feund no evidence of it in his investigations. His results suggest that Shepard's soda may have come from common salt present, and his sulphuric acid from sulphate of lime. Epiglaubite is described as occurring in \" small aggregates or interlaced masses of minute semi transparent crystals of a shining vitreous lustre, which are always implanted on druses of glaub apatite, with fl.=about 2-5,\" and as being \" a largely hydrate phosphate, chiefly of lime, andmay also contain magnesia and soda.\" It is not impossible that tho mineral is metaiirushite, although some characters are inconsistent with such a conclusion. If so, the name epiglaubite (meaning occurring implanted on glaubapatite) is inapplicable, and should be rejected. 520. PHARMACOLITE.

None of the mineral phosphates or arsenates were distinctively recognized in ancient miner alogy. The species containing copper, if observed, were left to pass under the general names of chrysocolla and malachites. In 1747, Wallerius has, besides Koppar-Lazur or azurite, the twc species Copper Green (malachite) and Copper Blue (chrysocolla and azurite in part), but without well-defined limits. Cronstedt, in 1758, describes the Mountain Blue as sometimes impure (terra calcarea mixta), and hence effervescing with aqua-fortis. Fontana, in 1778, announced the green carbonate after an analysis; and Bergmann in his Seiagraphia, 1782, recognizes only carbonate Df copper, and calls wrongly the green mica of Werner '1730, and later torbernite) a chlorid. Id t"], [621, "565 HTDEOUS PHOSPHATES AND AESENATES. 1786 Klaproth analyzed an arsenate, and Werner soon after gave it the name of Olivenerz ; and in WeneF's system of 1789 (Bergm. J., 382, 1789), Azurite, Malachite, Copper green of compact tex ture not effervescing with acids (chrysocolla), and Olivenerz, together with a so-called Eisenschiissig Eupfergrun (mostly earthy green carbonate), were the only species. Karsten's Tabellen of 1800 contains no addition to the list. But in 1801 Bournon announced, from an analysis by Chenevix, a second arsenate, aftervzard called Liroconiie; Yauquelin a third, afterward named Chalco phyllite; Klaproth a fourth, the Slrahliges Olivenerz, or Clinoclase. Klaproth also published at the same time an analysis of the first phosphate, now called Pseudomalachite; besides one of the cxychlorid Atacamite, which mineral had been brought from Chili as copper sand between 1780 and 1790, and was pronounced an oxyd by Yauquelin, and a chlorid by Karsten in his Tabellen of 1800. 637.

Obs Occurs in veins traversing slate at Virneberg, near Rheinbreitenbach, and at Ehl, near Linz, on the Rhine, along with other copper ores ; at Hirschberg in Voigtland ; Libethen in Hungary ; Nischne Tagilsk in Siberia. A single specimen has been found in Cornwall, consisting of minute globular concretions. Also met with in the Perkiomen mine, Pa. ; in Cabarras Co., N. C. The phosphates of copper were included in the olivenerz and malachite of the mineralogists of last century. Pseudomalachite of Hausmann is the earliest of the names of this species, and is as short and as good as the later Phosphorochalcite of Glocker. Lunnite was substituted by Bernhardi, and has been used in some recent works. But Lunn's one analysis was not made until 1821, and gives a different composition from that since obtained. It will certainly be soon enough to use his name in mineralogy when a mineral having the composition he arrived at, and thus befitting it, has been identified. 544. ERINITE. Haid., Ann.

Soluble in muriatic acid, and also in caustic potash. Obs. \u2014 Wavellite was first discovered in a tender clay slate near Barnstaple, in Devonshire, by Dr. Wavel. It has since been found at Clonmel and Cork, Ireland ; in the Shaint Isles of Scot land ; at Zbirow in Bohemia ; Zajecov iu Bohemia : at Frankenberg and Langenstriegis, Saxony ; Diensberg near Giessen, Hesse Darmstadt; on brown iron ore in the Jura limestone at Amberg in Bavaria (the lasionite of Fuchs) ; in a manganese mine at Weinbach near Weilburg in Nassau (Genth) ; at Villa Pica, Minas Geraes, Brazil. In the United States reported as found near Saxton's River, Bellows Falls, N. H. ; also at the slate quarries of York Co., Pa., near the Susquehanna; at Washington mine, Davidson Co., N. C, with actinolite, pyrite, and native silver ; at Steamboat, Chester Co., Pa., in a bed of limouite, abundant in stalactitic forms, part looking like gibbsite, part drusy with rhombic crystals, and often coated with a pearly scaly mineral yet undetermined. Named after Dr. Wavel, the discoverer. The species was considered a variety of diaspore by D'Aubuisson, Bournon, Hausmann, and some other early mineralogists, and placed next to dias pore by Werner in 1817 ; while Jameson arranged it in 1816 among the zeolites.

Named from the Latin plumbum, lead, and gummi, gum. The identity of de Lisle's mineral (which was carnelian-Iike in color) with plombgomme, though questioned by de Laumont in his early paper, is admitted in his letter cited in Ann. Phil, xiv. 31, 1819. The mineral looks usually like drops or coatings of gum, also at times somewhat like chalcedony or allophane. It differs from globular pyromorphite or blende in not being fibrous within. The hitehcockite occurs in botryoidal crusts and thin coatings, white, bluish, yellowish, or greenish, allophane-like, sometimes concentric in structure; Shepard gives H. = 2'75\u2014 3, and says that it loses 29 p. c. on ignition. 557.

With salt of phosphorus and tin on charcoal gives an opaque red bead (copper). Soluble in muriatic acid. Obs.\u2014 Occurs in clay slate, in a mountainous district in Persia, not far from Nichabour. Ac cording to Agaphi, the only naturalist who has visited the locality, turquois occurs ouly in veins, which traverse the mountain in all directions. Fischer, in 1816, named the different varieties Calaite, Agaphite (or conchoidal T.), and Jobnite (or quartzy T.). Pieces of the size of a hazel nut are considered very large. An impure variety is found in Silesia, and at Oelsnitz in Saxony; Dear the well of Nasaiph between Suez and Sinai. W. P. Blake refers here a hard, yellowish to bluish-green stone (which he identifies with the chalchihuiil of the Mexicans) from the mountains Los Cerillas, 20 m. S.E. of Santa Fe; H.= 6; G. = 2'426\u2014 2*651 (Am. J. Sci., II. xxv. 227). A pale green turquois occurs in the Columbus district, Nevada. Turquois receives a good polish, and is highly esteemed as a gem. The Persian king is said to retain for his own use all the larger and finely tinted specimens. The Callais of Pliny is generally regarded as turquois, and probably rightly so. But all he says of it is, \"Callais sapphirum imitator, candidior et litoroso mari similis,\" resembling sapphire (that is, lapis-lazuli) in color, but paler, and like the sea toward the shore ; indicating a greenish-blue tint and degree of opacity corresponding well enough with much turquois. The Callaina also of Pliny (to which he devotes a loug chapter) is referred to this species, and with even better reason. It was a stone of a pale green color, and was obtained, according to him, amid inaccessible rocks in the countries that lie at tho back of India, near Mt. Caucasus, etc. He also states that it was remarkable for its size, and was full of holes and foreign substances, which it is difficult to reconcile with the true turquois. But he speaks in the next sentence of a kind from Carmania (a district of Persia) as of better quality and clearer, and this may have been real turquois. He says that no stones were more easily imitated, which is very true of turquois. He also remarks that the beauty of the Callaina is greatly heightened by a setting of gold, the contrast peculiarly befitting it. Pliny also speaks of another stone called Callaica (xxxvii. 56), and says of it : \" Callaicam vocant e turbido callaino; ferunt pluris conjunctis semper inveniri ; \" it is so called because it is a turbid callaina, and they are found together. He also remarks that the stone called \"Augetis (xxxvii. 54) saultis non aha videtur quam callaina,\" by many is thought to be nothing but callaina. (See further Callainite, p. 572). The Persian smaragdus, or emerald, alluded to by Pliny (xxxvii. 18, citing from Democritus), as without transparency, agreeable and uniform in color, satisfying the vision without allowing it to penetrate it,\" may have been turquois; yet, as with most of Pliny's descriptions (owing to his mixing different things of similar aspect), when all the other characters given are weighed they leave doubt. It is probable that the turquois \u2014 oriental and occidental \u2014 was as commonly used in Persia as a gem in ancient times as now. The name turquois is French in form, and means Turkish, a Turkish gem, the gem having come into Europe through Turkey. Most of the turquois (not artificial) used in jewelry in former centuries, as well as the present, and that described iu the early works on minerals, was bone-turquois (called also odontolite, from tfavs, tooth), which is fossil-bone, or tooth, colored by a phosphate of iron. Its organic origin becomes manifest under a microscope. Moreover, true turquois, when decomposed by muriatic acid, gives a fine blue color wiib ammonia which is not true ofthe odontolite."], [638, "582 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 564. PEGANITE.

Similar figures are given by Greg & Lettsom, Min., 384. The angles of B. & M. do not agree with any of tli6 meas urements. First named torberite (torbernite) by Werner, after the chemist Torber Bergmann [Lat Torbernus, as written by Bergmann himself]. Then, this naming after persons having been denounced as an innovation (see Karsten's AVerner's Verbess., 43, 1793), Werner substituted Chalcolite (fr. ya,.a;, copper, signifying, as he says, \"ein Kupfer haltender Stein\") in allusion to Bergmann's deter mination in 17S0 that the mineral was muriate of copper. When, finally, it was shown by Klap roth to be au ore of uranium instead of copper, Werner, with Karsten and others, threw aside chalcolite, because false in signification, and used Uranglimmer (uran-mica). Chalcolite has since crept back again, but is no more appropriate now than it was sixty years ago Tho name tor berite was written as it should be, torbernite, by some mineralogists of last century. Both this species and the autunite have gone under the common name of uranite ; the former also as Copper-uranite, the latter Lime-uranite. 573. AUTUNITE.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 Same as for torbernite, but no reaction for copper. Obs. \u2014 Autunito is found usually with other ores of uranium, associated with silver, tin, anj iron ores. Occurs in the Siebengebirge, in the hornstono of a tracbytic range ; at Johanngeorgen stadt and Eibenstock ; at Lake Onega, Wolf Island, Russia ; near Limoges, and at St. Symphorien near Autun; formerly at South Basset, Wheal Edwards, and near St. Day, England. Occurs sparingly at the Middletown (Ct.) feldspar quarry, associated with columbite and albite, in minute tabular crystals and thin scales, of light green and lemon-yellow colors ; also in minute crystals at Chesterfield, Mass., on the quartz or albite, and sometimes in the red centres of tour malines, and at Acworth, N. H., straw-yellow and light green ; also in a gneiss quarry on the Schuylkill, near Philadelphia, about \\ m. above the suspension bridge. Descloizeaux makes autunite to differ from torbernite (Ann. d. M., V. xiv. 1 857 ) in being optically biaxial, and therefore orthorhombic ; and the planes 2 of the latter thus become 2-i and 2-1, as they incline unequally to the base. The angles are still very closely the same, the pyramidal 95\u00b0 52', being in torbernite 96\u00b0 6', Kokscharof; 95\u00b0 52', Hessenberg; 95\u00b0 46', Haidinger. The species are at least closely isomorphous. Berzelius calls the uranite of Cornwall and that of Autun, respectively, chalcolite and uranite, in his article announcing the composition, in Jahresb., iv. 146, 147, 1823 ; and the special application ol uranite to this species dates from that time. Yet, in order to avoid confusion from the double use of the name, it is better to adopt for the species the name of autunite, from one of its noted localities. Fkitzscheite Breith., B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 302, 1865. A mineral much resembling uranite in its four-sided quadratic (or nearly so) tables, with a perfect basal cleavage ; with H.=2 \u2014 2*5 ; G.= jf-504?; vitreous to pearly in lustre ; reddish-brown to hyacinth-red in color and streak ; trans lucent ; affording Fritzsche (1. c.) reactions for oxyd of uranium, protoxyd of manganese, vanadic \u25a0tcid, phosphoric acid, aud water. The red color is attributed to the manganese, and it is consid ered a mangan-uranito containing some vanadic acid. It occurs with crystals of autuuite and torbernite at Neuhammer, near Neudeck in Bohemia, in a hematite mine ; at Johanngeorgen stadt, of fine red color, with torbernite. Bed crystals in groups, supposed to be this mineral, have been observed on specimens of uranite from Autun, and from Steiuig, near Elsterberg, in Saron Voigtlanil May it be an altered uranite ? 574.

Obs. \u2014 Found generally in minute needle-form crystals, and crusts on the surface of the earth, ou walls, rock s, etc. It forms abundantly in certain soils in Spain, Egypt, and Persia, especially during hot weather succeeding rains. Also manufactured from soils where other nitrates (nitrate of lime or soda) form in a similar manner, and beds called nitriaries are arranged for this purpose in France, Germany, Sweden, Hungary, and other countries. Refuse animal matter, also, putrified in calcareous soils, gives rise to the nitrate of lime. Old plaster, lixiviated, affords about 5 p. c. of nitre. In India it is obtained in large quantities for the arts. Nitre requires for its formation dry air and long periods without rain ; the potash comes mainly from the debris of feldspathic rocks in the soil. The oxydation of the nitrogen of the air is pro moted by organic matters; hence the nitre is generally associated with azotized decomposed organic substances.

In Madison Co., Kentucky, it is found scattered through the loose earth covering the bottom of a large cave. Also in other caverns in the Mississippi valley. Those of Tennessee, along the limestone slopes and in the gorges ofthe Cumberland table-land, afford it abundantly. Nitre, according to Frankenheim, is dimorphous, like carbonate of lime ; one form prismah, (aragonite-like), the other rhombohedral (calcite-like). The prismatic is the normal one between -10\u00b0 C. and 300\u00b0 C. ; and between these temperatures the rhooibohedral is easily transformed into the prismatic through the presence of some foreign substance. Above 300\u00b0 the rhombo hedral is the normal one, the prismatic here changing to it, and retaking again its form on a diminution of temperature (Pogg., xcii. 354). 691. SODA NITRE.

Boric acid occurs in but few minerals ; viz., Datolite, Danburite, Axi nite, and Tourmaline, with the following. It is a remarkable fact that in all of them, as far as known, the crystallization is either hemihedral or oblique. Boracite and Bhodizite are hemihedral isometric ; Tourmaline hemihedral rhombohedral ; Datolite is monoclinic ; while Danburite and Axinite are triclinic. In Tourmaline and Axinite boric acid acts the parti of a base. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SPECIES. 1. 0. ratio for bases and acid 1 : 1. 694. Sassolite fl'B B[e,]H, 695.

Obs. \u2014 This long known compound, the Sal sedativum Hombergii, was first detected in nature by Hoeser in the waters of the Tuscan lagoons of Monte Rotondo and Castelnnovo, and afterward in the solid state at Sasso by Mascagni. The hot vapors of the lagoons consist largely of boric acid. To collect it the vapors are made to pass through water, which absorbs the boric acid; the waters are then evaporated by means of the steam from the springs. They yield seven to eight thousand pounds troy per day. These lagoons spread over a surface of about 30 miles ; and in the distance, clouds of vapor are seen rising in large volumes among the mountains. The crude borax contains 20 p. c. or more of impurities, among which Wittstein and Payen found 13*7 p. c. of sulphates (the most abundant, sulph. ammonia 8-5 p. c, sulph. magnesia 2-6 p. c). Exists also in other natural waters, as at Wiesbaden ; Aachen ; Krankenheil near Folz ; Clear Lake, in Lake Co., California; and it has been detected in the waters of the ocean. Occurs also abundantly in the crater of Tulcano, one of the Lipari isles, forming a layer od \u2022sulphur, and about the fumaroles, where it was discovered by Dr. Holland in 1813. E!enngott states that artificial crystals are monoclinic; with I A J=118\u00b0 4', I A i-I=120\u00b0 50'; and twinned parallel to i-i (Ber. Ak. Wien, xii. 26). 595. SZAIBELYITE. Szaibelyit K. F.

An iron-boracite (Eisenstassfurtit) from Stassfurt is described by Huyssen (Jahrb. Min. 1805, 329), having half the Mg replaced by Fe.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 The massive variety gives water in the closed tube. B.B. both varieties fuse at 2 with intumescence to a white crystalline pearl, coloring the flame green ; heated after moisten ing with cobalt solution assumes a deep pink color. Mixed with oxyd of copper and heated on charcoal colors the flame deep azure-blue (chlorid of copper). Soluble in muriatic acid. Soluble in powder in dilute muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids, and the massive kind most readily so. Alters very slowly on exposure, owing to the chlorid of magnesium present, which takes up water. It is the frequent presence of this deliquescent chlorid in the massive mineral, thus originat ing, that led to the view that there was a hydrous boracite (stassfurtite). See on this point Bischof's Steinsalzwerke bei Stassfurt, p. 36, and Steinbeck in Pogg., cxxv. 68. Parasite of Volger is a result of the same kind of alteration in the interior of crystals of boracite, which gives the somewhat plumose character it has, and the water. Weber's analysis above was prob ably made on such an altered crystal. Obs. \u2014 Observed in beds of anhydrite, gypsum, or salt.

Fused with fluor spar and bisulphate of potash it colors the flame around the assay a clear green. Soluble in water, yielding a faintly alkaline solution. Boiling water dissolves double its weight of this salt. Obs.\u2014 Borax was originally brought from a salt lake in Thibet. The borax is dug in masses from the edges and shallow parts of the lake, and in the course of a short time the holes thus made are again filled. This crude borax was formerly sent to Europe under the name of tincal, and there purified. It is announced by Dr. J. A. Veatch as existing in the waters of the sea along the California coast, and in those of many of the mineral springs of Califoruia (J. Frankl. Inst., 1860). Crystals, 2 or 3 iuches across, occur in the mud of Borax Lake, near Clear Lake, Cal., 65 m. N.W. of Suisun Bay and 36 m. from the Pacific. It has also been found at Viquintizoa and Escapa in Peru ; at Halberstadt in Transylvania ; in Ceylon. It occurs in solution in tho mineral springs of Chambly, St. Ours, etc., Canada East (Hunt, Logan's G. Rep., 1 853). The waters of Borax Lake, California, contain, according to G. E. Moore, 535*08 grains of crys tallized borax to the gallon (Am. J. Sci., xli. 257). Borax is now extensively made from the boric acid of the Tuscan lagoons, by the reaction of this acid on carbonate of soda. This salt is employed in several metallurgical operations as a flux, is sometimes used in the manufacture of glass and gems, and extensively in the process of soldering. Named borax from the Arabic buraq, which included also the nitre (carbonate of soda) of ancient writers, the natron of the Egyptians. Prof. Bechi has analyzed a borate occurring as an incrustation at the Tuscan lagoons, which afforded B 43*56, Na ly*25, fl 37-19=100, giving the formula Na B**+6 fl (Am. J. Sci., II. xvii. 128). 600.

Jfag., IV. xxv. 113), from the waters of the hot springs, Banos del Toro, in the Cordilleras of Coquimbo, may be of the above species. It occurs in the waters in the form of snow-white silky or featherj- flakes, and also as a flaky sediment at the bottom. Forbes suggests that the mineral is formed by the action of hot vapors, volcanic in source, on the lime of the waters through which they pass. 601. HOWLITE. Silicoborocalcite H. Hovj, Phil.

Hoppe-Seyler (Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxl. 247) found indium in two specimens of wolfram; oni contained 0-228 p. c. The metal tungsten was first recognized in this mineral by the brothers J. Joseph and F d'Elhuyar, in 1785 (Ch. Anal, of Wolfram, etc., translated from the Spanish by Ch. Cullen, London 1755, a work of which a German translation by Gren was published at Halle in 1786). They obtained from the Zinnwald mineral Tungstic acid 65*0, oxyd of manganese 22*0, of iron 13'5 = 100-5. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. fuses easily (F.=2-5 \u2014 3) to a globule, which has a crystalline surface and is magnetic. With salt of phosphorus gives a clear reddish-yellow glass while hot, which is palei on cooling ; in R.F. becomes dark red ; on charcoal with tin, if not too saturated, the bead assumes on cooling a green color, which continued treatment in R.F. changes to reddish-yellow. With soda and nitre on platinum foil fuses to a bluish-green manganate. Decomposed by aqua regia with separation of tungstic acid as a yellow powder, wiiich, when treated B.B., reacts as under tungstite (p. 186). Wolfram is sufficiently decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid, or even muriatic acid, to give a colorless solution, which, treated with metallic zinc, becomes intensely blue, but soon bleaches on dilution. Obs. \u2014 Wolfram is often associated with tin ores ; also in quartz, with native bismuth, tungstate of lime, pyrite, galenite, blende, etc. It occurs at Cornwall, much to the detriment of the tin ores. Found in fine crystals at Schlackenwald, Schneeberg, Geyer, Freiberg, Altenberg, Ehrenfriedersdorf, Zinnwald, and Nertschinsk, aud other places mentioned above ; at Chanteloup, near Limoges, in France ; near Redruth and elsewhere in Cornwall ; in Cumberland (the ratio 2 : i at Lochfells, that of 4 : 1 at Godolphin's Ball) ; on the Island of Rona, one of the Hebrides ; iu the auriferous sand of the Wicklow rivers, Ireland, with tin. Also iu S. America, at Oruro in Bolivia. The crystals of Zinnwald are remarkable as hemitropes. In the U. States it occurs at Lane's mine, Monroe, Conn., iu quartz, associated with native bis muth and the other minerals above mentioned, often pseudomorphous after tungstate of lime ; in small quantities at Trumbull, Conn., at the topaz vein; massive aud in crystals on Camdagcfarm, near Blue Hill Bay, Me. ; at the Flowe mine, Mecklenburg Co., N.

Francis River ; in a gneiss boulder on the W. shore of Chief Island, L. Couchiching, Canada West ; at Mammoth mining district, Nevada. This species is shown to be isomorphous with columbite by G. Rose (Pogg., lxiv. 171). Des cloizeaux found in the angles of wolfram some evidence that the crystals were monoclinic. But G*. Rose shows from the twins that the form is orthorhombic and not oblique.

Obs. \u2014 Tungstate of lime is usually associated with crystalline rocks, and is commonly found iu connection with tin ore, topaz, fluorite, apatite, molybdenite, or wolfram, in quartz. Occurs at Schlackenwald and Zinnwald in Bohemia; in the Riesengebirge ; in fine crystals at Caldbeck Fell, near Keswick, with apatite, molybdenite, and wolfram. Also at Schellgaden in Salzberg; Neudorf in the Harz ; Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony; Posing in Hungary; Traversella in Piedmont, in fine crystals, sometimes transparent; Dalecarlia and Bitsberg in Sweden; Fra mont in the Vosges, with pyrite in polished crystals, giving Delesse for the angles of octahedron 1, 100\u00b0 5' and 130\u00b0 31', G.=6-05; at the copper minos of Llamuco, near Chuapa in Chili, of a reddish-gray color, mixed with green, due to chrysocolla. In the United States, crystallized and massive at Lane's Mine, Monroe, and at Huntington, Conn., with wolfram, pyrite, rutile, and native bismuth, in quartz; at Chesterfield, Mass., in albite, with tourmaline; in the Mammoth mining* district, Nevada; at Bangle mine, in Cabanas Co., N. C. ; and Flowe mine, Mecklenburg Co., some crystals at the latter locality having a nucleua of wolfram. Tungstic acid was discovered in this species by the Swedish chemist Scheele, in 1781.

Found first at Bleiberg, Schwar zenbach, and Windisch-Kappel, in Carinthia ; also at Ruskitza in Austria ; at Retzbanya and Szaska in Hungary; at Przibram; at Moldawa in the Bannat, where its crystals are red. and have considerable resemblance to chromate of lead ; in the Kirghis Steppes in Russia ; at Anna berg, Schneeberg, and Johanngeorgenstadt in Saxony; at Badenweiler in Baden; sparingly at Chalanches, Dept. of Isere, in France ; in the gold sands of Rio Chico in Antioquia, Columbia, S. A. ; in Lackentyre, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. It is found in small quantities at the Southampton lead mine, Mass. ; in fine yellow and reddish orange to red crystals (lig. 499, and also in thin tables) at Wheatley's mine, near Phenixville, Pa. : at the Comstock lode in Nevada ; at Empire mine, Inyo Co., Cal. ; in the Weaver dist., Arizona.

Laube's analysis confirms Patera's result. The mineral is so intimately mixed with pyrite and bismuthinite that, even with the greatest care, it could not be completely separated. Subtracting the bismuth, iron, and sul phur in the above analysis, molybdate of cobalt remains, which, according to Laube, is this truf mineral."], [665, "609 TUNGSTATES, MOLYBDATES, VANADATES.

Zippe's vanadite (1. c.) is referred to descloizite by A. Schrauf (Pogg., cxvi. 355, 1862). The mineral occurs at Kappel in Carinthia, in small clove-brown rhombic octahedrons, with G.=5*83. Tschermak obtained in his analysis (Ber. Ak. Wien, xliv. ii. 158) V45-7, Pb 54-3 = 100 (with no zinc, although looked for), and referred the species to dechenite.

Schrauf suggests that both descloizite and vanadite are dechenite ; and Tschermak (Pogg , cxvii. 349) that vanadite aud dechenite are one species, and descloizite an altered vanadite. Named after the French mineralogist Descloizeaux. 620A. Vanadate of Lead, from Phenixville, Pa. A thin crystalline crust of a dark purple, almost black color, but dark hyacinth-red by transmitted light, and of a dark yellow streak, occurs covering quartz, ferruginous clay, and wulfenite, at Phenixville. With a magnifying glass it appears to consist of minute lenticular crystals. It could not be wholly separated from the associated wulfenite and other impurities for analysis, and the result obtained is therefore not wholly satisfactory. J. L. Smith found (Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 247, 1855): V 11-70, Mo 20-14, Pb 55*01, SEn, Al 5*90, Cu 1*13, sand 2-21, aq 2-94=99-03. Subtracting the lead required by the molyb dic acid to make wulfenite, it leaves 22-82 p. c. sol- the 11*70 of vanadic acid: which is nearer the composition of descloizite than that of dechenite. 621.

Decom posed by muriatic acid. If nitric acid be dropped on the crystals they become first deep red from the separation of vanadic acid, and then yellow upon its solution. Obs. \u2014 This mineral was first discovered at Zimapan in Mexico, by Del Rio. It has since been obtained among some of the old workings at Wanlockhead in Dumfriesshire, where it occurs in small globular masses, sprinkled over calamine, or forming thin coatings on the surface of that mineral, and also in hexagonal crystals, the largest not more than \u00b1 iu. across ; also at Beresof in the Ural, with pyromorphite ; and near Windisch Kappel in Carinthia, in crystals, the angles as above given. This mineral has never been found at Wicklow, Ireland, although so reported by Thomson (Greg and Lettsom). Schabus gives for the forms from Windisch Kappel I, 1 ; I, 1 , \u00a7 ; I, 1, 2-2 ; 0, I, 1, $ ; O, I, 1, 1-2. The basal angle of pyramid 1 in different crystals was 78\u00b0 40'\u2014 78\u00b0 54'. The angles are very near those of mimetite and pyromorphite, the basal angle in the former being 79\u00b0 24' \u2014 80\u00b0 \u202213' ; and in pyromorphite of Bleistadt, 80\u00b0 40' (Pogg., c. 297). Kokscharof regards the crystals 1'rom Beresof as pseudomorphs after pyromorphite; and Struve observes that the crystals contain at centre a portion of unaltered pyromorphite (Min. Russi., iii. 44). Del Rio discovered this species at Zimapan, and obtained from it, in 1801, 80-72 of oxyd of lead, and 14-8 of a new metallic acid, tlie basis of which he called Erylhronium. This result was set aside by himself in the Ann. des Sci. Nat. de Madrid, Feb. 1804 (Ann. d. M., iv. 1819), and also by Descotils in the Ann. Ch., liii. 1805, both of whom made the acid the chromic, and the mineral a brown chromate of lead. The metal vanadium was not discovered by Sefstrom until 1830, and then in iron made of ore from Taberg, Sweden ; and in the same year Wohler showed that Del Rio's lead ore was a vanadate. 622.

An ore similar in color and clayey appearance to Domeyko's mineral, has been announced by J. E. Teschemacher among specimens from the Cliff Mine, in the Lake Superior Copper Region. The presence of vanadium was ascer tained by both blowpipe and acid tests. The color is a dark chocolate, and also a bright yellow. The exact state of composition of the vanadic acid is doubtful. There is no oxyd of lead in the ore, and the brown variety is mixed with an earthy oxyd of iron; when carefully separated from the gangue it was found to contain no copper. This Min., 531, 1850. 6. SULPHATES, CHKOMATES, TELLUEATES. In crystalline form, specific gravity, and color, the Sulphates vary almost indefinitely. The hardness is not above 4. The Chromates have bright, deep red, and green to brown colors, with the hardness 2*5\u20143*5. No native hydrous chromates are known. The compounds of sulphates and carbonates, or sulphato-carbonates, have the crystallization of the sulphates, the carbonic acid being wholly subordinated, as regards the form produced, to the sulphuric, the more powerful acid. Thus leadhillite is hom\u0153omorphous with anglesite, celes tine, etc., susannite with dreelite, and lanarlcits with glauberite ; and these species are accordingly here included. General Pyrognostic Cliaracters of the Sulphates. The sulphates of the alkalies, the alkaline earths"], [669, "613 SULPHATES, CHEOMATES, TELLEEATES. and oxyd of lead, are not decomposed by heating in the matrass or closed tube ; other sulphates, such as those of protoxyd of iron, manganese, etc., arc partially decomrosed with the evolution of sulphurous and sulphuric acids. On charcoal the sulphates of the alkalies and alkaline earths are in R.F. reduced to sulphids, which, moistened with dilute muriatic acid, evolve sulphuretted hydrogen; the other sulphates thus treated give off sulphurous acid, and leave earths or metallic oxvds, or metals or metallic sulphids, and sometimes, where the metal is volatile, coat the coal with oxyd. All non-volatile sulphates when fused with soda or neutral oxalate of potash on charcoal yield a hepatic mass, which is more or less absorbed by the coal ; when this is removed, and placed on a bright clean surface of silver with a drop or two of water, it stains the metal yel lowish-brown to black from the formation of sulphid of silver ; treated with muriatic acid the fused mass evolves sulphuretted hydrogen. In soluble minerals the sulphuric acid may be readily detected on adding to the solution a few drops of soluble baryta salt, which produces a white precipitate, insoluble in acids and in ammonia. I.

Celestobarite ; the spar containing much sulphate of strontian, as that of Binnen valley, Switzerland (anaL 2), to which von Waltershausen applied the name baryto-celestine, and also that of anal. 3, 4. The angles of the Binnen spar, according to Hugard, are intermediate between those of barite and celestite. 6. Calstronbarite, from Schoharie, N\". V., has the aspect of a mere mixture. Shepard made it a compound (1. c.) of carbonates of strontia (22-30) and lime (12*15), with 65*55 p. c. of sulphate of baryta, and says it is partly soluble in muriatic-acid with effervescence. Von Hauer found a specimen from Schoharie labelled calstronbarite to consist of sulphates alone. Cawk is the ordinary barite of the Derbyshire lead mines. Withering, who first analyzed it (Phil. Trans., lxxiv. 293, 1784), describes it as occurring in roundish forms, consisting of rhom boidal lamin\u00e6 confusedly aggregated and white or reddish in color, with G.=4-330 ; aud a second"], [674, "618 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. variety as radiated fibrous, somewhat silky in lustre, and at times concentric in structure, yellow ish-white, and opaque, with G.=4-00. Greg & Lettsom (1858) confine the term to an opaque earthy variety of the Derbyshire lead mines. The barite of Muszar, Hungary, and of Betler, near Rosenau, was early called Wolnyn. It is common barite, in crystals, usually oblong in the direction of the vertical axis, and generally with i-i and 0 large, and also i-2 large. A. Schrauf mentions the following as other occurring planes 0, 4-i, 1-i, i-i, l-i, 8-i, 2-5, 1-1, 1, 2, 1-2, 2-2, 3-3, 4-J (Ber. Ak. Wien, xxxix. 286).

Freiesleben found 8 p. c. of silica in a variety from Nassau. Allomorphite, according to Gerngross, contains 1-9 p. c. of sulphate of lime as impurity, but von Hauer found none (Jahrb. G.

If a portion of this mass be removed, placed on a clean silver surface, and mois tened, it gives a black spot of sulphid of silver. Should the barite contain sulphate of lime, this will not be absorbed by the coal when treated in powder with soda. Insoluble in acids Obs. \u2014 Occurs commonly in connection with beds or veins of metallic ores, as part of the gangue of the ore. It is met with in secondary limestones, sometimes forming distinct veins, and often in crystals along with calcite and celestite. At Duftou, in Westmoreland, England, large transparent crystals occur, sometimes of gigantic dimensions; some were found lying in the mud at the bottom of a cavern, and one weighed lOo Ibs. Other English localities exist in Cornwall, near Liskeard, etc., in Cumberland and Lanca shire, in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, etc.; fine stalactitic at Newhaven in Derbyshire; in Scotland, in Argyleshire, at Strontian ; in Perthshire, of a bright yellow color at Ballindean ; at the Cumber land lead mine ; in Ireland, in thick veins in old red sandstone, at Ballynascreen iu Londonderry. The septaria of Durham, England, which are cut and polished for tables, etc., have the veinings fined with brown heavy spar, adding much to their beauty. Some of the most important European localities are at Felsobanya and Kremnitz, at Freiberg, Marienberg, Clausthal, Przibram, and at Roya and Roure in Auvergne. In the United States, in N.

On charcoal in R.F. reduced to a sulphid; with soda does not fuse to a clear globule, and is not absorbed by the coal like barite ; is, however, decomposed, and yields a mass which blackens silver ; with fluorite fuses to a clear pearl, which is enamel- white on cooling, and by long blowing swells up and becomes infusible. Soluble in muriatic acid. One hundred parts of water, at 18-75\u00b0 C, dissolve 0'2 part of anhydrite. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in rocks of various ages, especially in limestone strata, and often the same that contain ordinary gypsum, and also very commonly in beds of rock salt. It was first discovered at tbe salt mine near Hall in Tyrol, by Abbe Poda ; and next that of Bex, Switzerland. Other localities are at Aussee, both crystallized and massive, the former sometimes in splendid geodea (f. 511), the latter brick-red; at Sulz on the Neckar, in Wiirtemberg; Himmelsberg, near Ilfeld; Bleiberg in Carinthia; Luneburg, Hanover; Lauterberg in the Harz ; Kapnik in Hungary; Ischl in Upper Austria; Aussee in Styria ; Berchtesgaden in Bavaria; at Rienthal and elsewhere in the Alps, crystals, or their cavities, within quartz crystals ; Stassfurt, in fine crystals. In the U. States, at Loekport, N. Y., fine blue, in geodes of black limestone, accompanied with crystals of calcite and gypsum. In Nova Scotia it forms extensive beds at the estuary of the Avon and the St. Croix rivers, also near the Five Islands and elsewhere, associated with gypsum, in the Carboniferous formation. A crystal from Hall, figured by Haiiy, was a stout rectangular prism, with planes I on the lateral edges, giving i-i A 7=140\u00b0 4', whence I A 1=100\u00b0 8'. The Stassfurt crystals (f. 510, Blum, Jahrb. Min. 1865, 001) have nearly the ordinary forms of barite, and approximate to them in angles. Schrauf makes the angle over i-i of an occurring vertical prism (Pogg., cxvii. 650, 1862) 120\u00b0, and v. Rath (Ber. nied. Ges. Bonn, 201, 1862) 121\u00b0 24'. Blum states that the prism 7 is the most common; it is vertically striated, and these striations are formed of planes of the other vertical prisms measured by him ; measurements only approximations. Schrauf and Blum make the angle 1-i A l-i=85\u00b0; Fuchs (B. H. Ztg., xxi. 198), 84\u00a3\u00b0; and v. Rath, 84\u00b0 34'. In fig. 511 the plane o is in the same vertical zone with s; and if o is made the plane 1 (as done by Brooke and Miller), n is 2-2, and/3-8. B. and M. obtained in their measurements for i-i ons n, o, 153\u00b0 14', 143\u00b0 41', and 123\u00b0 31' (Phil. Mag., III. 19, 178); and Grailich and Lang, for the same (Ber. Ak. Wien, xxvii. 25), 153\u00b0 50', 143\u00b0 37', 124\u00b0 10'. The latter give for their calculated results, 153\u00b0 184/, 142\u00b0 59\u00a3', 123\u00b0 324/. The prism i-f, which has the angle 102\u00b0 34', may be that homo logous with 7 of barite; in this case the brachydiagonal above would be the maerodiagonal. Alt. \u2014 Absorbs moisture and changes to gypsum. Extensive beds are sometimes thus altered in pait or throughout, as at Bex, in Switzerland, where, by digging down 60 to 100 ft, the unaltered anhydrite may be found. Sometimes specimens of anhydrite are altered between the folia or over the exterior. Also altered to quartz and siderite. 633. ANGLESITE. Vitriol de Plomb Monnet, Syst. Min., 371, 1779.

Obs. \u2014 This ore of lead was first observed by Monnet as a result of the decomposition of gale nite, and it is often found in its cavities. At Leadhills it occurred, occupying the cubical cavities of galenite, or disposed on the surface of the ore ; and this locality, and also that of Wanlock head, formerly afforded large and beautiful crystals, some transparent and several inches in diameter. First found in England at Parys mine in Anglesea. Occurs also at Melanoweth in Cornwall ; iu Derbyshire and in Cumberland in crystals ; Clausthal, ZeUerfeld, and Giepenbach, iu the Harz ; near Siegen in Prussia ; Schapbach in the Black Forest, Badenweiler in Breisgau ; and in Sardinia in small but perfect transparent crystals ; Fondon in Granada ; massive in Siberia, Andalusia, Alston Moor in Cumberland; in Australia, whence it is exported by the ton to England. In the United States it occurs in large crystals at Wheatley's mine, Phenixville, Pa. (f. 512, 513, 514); less well crystallized iu Missouri lead mines; at the lead mine of Southampton, Mass.; at Rossie, N. Y. ; with galenite at the Walton gold mine, Louisia Co., Va. Named from the locality, Anglesea, where it was first found by Dr. Withering. For recent papers on cryst., Kokscharof, Min. Russi., i. 34, ii. 167, iii. 243, elaborate ; v. Lang, Ber. Ak.

Sardinian is distorted anglesite from Monteponi in Sardinia, with which Richter found it to agree in composition; G. = 6*380\u20146-R92 ; H.=3\u2014 35; white and like anglesite in lustre. Breit haupt makes it hemidomatic (monoclinic or hemihedral); and found for the fundamental prism the angle 101\u00b0 52' ; and says that the bisectrix of the optical angle is normal to a plane truncating an edge of the fundamental prism, and not to the base as in anglesite. The optical fact stated shows that the prism is normally orthometnc ; and if the plane referred to be made the base (or plane O) then the mineral agrees with anglesite, both crystallographically and optically. The so-called fundamental prism is prism 4-i of anglesite, which has the angle, as above given, 101\u00b0 14'. The form approaches fig. 516 above.

Obs. \u2014 This ore has been found at Leadhills, with other ores of lead ; also in crystals at Red Gill, Cumberland, and near Taunton in Somersetshire. Grenada is also stated to be a locality of it, and the island of Serpho, Grecian Archipelago. The crystals seldom exceed an inch in length, and are commonly smaller. Reported by C. U. Shepard (Am. J. Sci., II. xv. 446) from Newberg. District, S. G, but there is some doubt as to the locality ; also from the Morgan silver mine, Spar tanburg District, S. C. Brooke and Miller, who show that the form of leadhillite is orthorhombic, make the prism J-i (of. 120\u00b0 20) the fundamental vertical prism, and appear to regard the species as related to aragonite. Tho fact that the twins are not formed parallel to the faces of this prism (as they should be if. the prism 4_-i were homologous with the aragonite prism), and the close approximation in angle to auglesite, shown above, besides other reasons, have led the author to adopt the position of the crystals here given, which exhibits the anglesite relation. Susannite (rhombohedral) and leadhil lite (orthorhombic) are mutually dimorphs, and so also aro dreelite and anglesite. Now susannite and dreelite are nearly identical in angle ; and therefore leadhillite and anglesite must be equally related. Since in susannite the sulphuric acid dominates over the carbonic acid, and impresses on the lead salt its character (or the form of the sulphate), the same should be the case with its cor relate leadhillite \u2014 this species being the very same chemical compound. (See on this subject, Am. J. Sci., II. xviii.). The hemihedrism of the species gives origin to the peculiar rhombohe dral aspect of the twins. The angles of these twins are near those of susannite. Fig. 1 is partly from Mohs, with other occurring planes, and is introduced to show the relations of tbe planes in the position of tho crystal adopted. On crystallization, Haidinger, Ed. Phil.

This species was first noticed by Lehman (1. a). The name Crocoite is from xpons, saffron. Berthier, in 1832, gave the word the bad form Crocoise, which von Kobell altered (to make it con formable to ordinary mineralogical nomenclature) in 1838, to Crocoisite, and Breithaupt, in 1841, to Crocoite (Krokoit), and v. Kobell also to this last mentioned form in his later works. Haus mann's Callochrome has the priority ; but as the name is a poorer one, not mineralogical in form, and the species was not one instituted by Hausmann, we allow Crocoite to stand. 643.

The so-called Reussin is impure glauber salt, as pronounced by Reuss in 1791, after his early study of it. It occurred as a deposit of crystals and efflorescent crusts in or about the mineral springs of Saidschitz and Sedlitz, and according to Reuss was most abundant near the end of the spring. The crystals (some of which were i to 2 in. long) had the form of stout 6-sided prisms, with two sides smaller than the others, terminating in two rhomboidal planes \u2014 the form of glauber salt. It is stated to have become a white powder on the expulsion by heat of the crys tallization-water. The analysis was made first on a solution of the salt, and afterward on the effloresced salt, which contained as a result of efflorescence (the usual result) no water ; and hence the amount of water was not ascertained. Crystals reproduced from tho solution lost more thau half their weight when heated to redness ; corresponding with the fact that both_glauber salt and epsomite contain more than 50 p. c. of water. The analysis afforded Reuss Na S 66*04, MgS 31-55, MgCl 2-19, Ca S 0-42; which, adding the water and excluding the Mg Cl, correspond*? to 68*0 of glauber salt, 31\"7 of epsomite, and 0-3 of gypsum=100.

The siliceous variety from Albay, Luzon (Philippine islands), was of volcanic origin. The gypsum of East River, Pictou, Nova Scotia, according to Prof. W. R. Johnson, and that of Southern Virginia, according to Prof. W. B. Rogers (Am. J. Sci., II. v. 113, 1848), contain 1 atom of water to 2 of sulphate of lime (2 Ca S+fl), the former affordiug S 54-7, lime 39*4, A 5-90. The passage of anhydrite into gypsum is exemplified on a large scale in many places, as at tho Canaria valley and at Box in Switzerland (Blum. Pseud., p. 24; Am. J. Sci., xlviii. 69), and the compound here described may have been formed in the course of the transition ; or, more proba bly, it is a mixture of gypsum and anhydrite. This compound is formed artificially only at a high temperature, or above 120'' C. The incrustations in steam-boilers on the ocean consist largely of it, as shown by J. F. W. Johnston, and later by R. W. Johnson, who gave for the composition of flue (Am. J.

Ignited at a temperature Dot exceeding 260\u00b0 C, it again combines with water when moistened, and becomes firmly solid. Soluble in muriatic acid, and also in 400 to 500 parts of water. Obs. \u2014 Gypsum often forms extensive beds in connection with various stratified rocks, especially limestones, and marlytes or clay beds. It occurs occasionally in crystalline rocks. It is also a product of volcanoes, occurring about fumaroles, or where sulphur gases are escaping, being formed from the sulphuric acid generated, and the lime afforded by the decomposing lavas \u2014 lime being contained in augite and labradorite. It is also produced by the decomposition of pyrite when lime is present; and often about sulphur springs where sulphuretted hydrogen is emitted, this gas changing, through reaction with vegetable matter, into sulphuric acid. Gypsum is also deposited on the evaporation of sea-water and brines, in which it exists in solution. Crystals may be seen to form on evaporating a drop of sea-water in the field of a microscope. Fine specimens are found in the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland ; at Hall in the Tyrol; in the sulphur mines of Sicily; in the gypsum formation near Ocana in Spain; in the clay of Shotover Hill, near Oxford ; and large lenticular crystals have been met with at Moutmartre, near Paris. A noted locality of alabaster occurs at Castelino, 35 m. from Leghorn, whence it is taken to Florence for the manufacture of vases, figures, ete. This species occurs in extensive beds in several of the United States, and more particularly N. York, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, and is usually associated with salt springs. Also in Nova Scotia, Peru, etc. Handsome selenite and snowy gypsum occur in K York, near Lockport (occasionally f. 532) in limestone along with pearl spar and anhydrite ; also near Camillus, Onondaga Co. ; occasionally crystals are met with in the vicinity of Manlius. In Maryland, large grouped crystals on the St. Mary's, in clay; also near the mouth of the Patuxent. In Virginia, large beds of gypsum with rock salt, in Washington Co., 18 m. from Abingdon ; also near Lynchburg. In Ohio, large transparent crystals have been found at Poland and Canfield, Trumbull Co. In Tenn., selenite and alabaster in Davidson Co. In Kentucky, in Mammoth Cave, it has the forms of rosettes, or flowers, vines, and shrubbery. Abundant also W. of the Mississippi in many places, and in California. In N. Scotia, in Sussex, King's Co., on Capt. McCready's farm, large single and grouped crystals, which mostly contain much symmetrically disseminated sand. Plaster of Paris (or gypsum which lias been heated aud ground up) is used for making moulds, taking casts of statues, medals, etc. ; for producing a hard finish on walls ; also in the manufacture of artiacial marble, as the scagliola tables of Leghorn, and in the glazing of porcelain.

There seems to be good reason for accepting as the tn.e fundamental form that above adopted, since the planes of the fundamental prism V, and 0, cor- respond in this case to directions of cleavage. Most authors make 2-i the prism I, and 2-i (of rare occurrence) the plane 0. The symbols, on this basis, with tho lettering of Miller, are as follows, following the above order (Hessenberg, Min. Not., No. iv.) : i-i (a) ; i-i (b), 1-i (I), 1 (n), 2-i (x), 3-cS (s); I(m, or / of Neumann), i-|, i-\\, i-i (h\\ i-if, i-i, i-i\\ (k), i-\\, i-4, i-f; -1-i (d), 0(q of Quen- stedt), i-i (e), f-i (ll of Hessenberg) ; -1 (I), 1-i (v), 1-h (u), i (w) ; -3-3 (y, or k of Neumann) ; \u00a3-\u00a3 (pj of Hessenberg). Named from yi\\p->s, the Greek for the mineral but more especially for the calcined mineral The derivation ordinarily suggested, from yf,, earth, and iipiv, to cook, corresponds with this, the most common use of the word among tho Greeks. Theophrastus, after mentioning localities, speaks of the making of gypsum by burning the proper stones (among which alabaster is included) ; of making plaster or cement from it by \" powdering it, pouring on water, and stirring it with wooden instruments, there being too much heat for the hand; \" of the necessity of preparing it \"imme- diately before the use of it, because it soon dries and becomes hard ; \" of its value for whitening the walls of houses, and of its being an excellent material for making images and ornaments. The word yiip'n in Plato and Herodotus has been sometimes translated chalk, but not so in the latest and best Lexicon \u2014 the recent edition of Stephanus. The sentences in Herodotus containing it, and the verb yvip6a derived from it meaning to cover or whiten with gypsum, are most intelligible if calcined gypsum, or preparations from it, are understood. Powdered chalk is not likely to have been used for a whitewash ; and a wash is implied instead of dry chalking. Moreover, true chalk was probably unknown to the Greeks, it being a produc- tion of more western countries ; and, according to Pliny, even the Romans included under their term Creta (Latin for chalk) principally clays, and prominently the \"Cimolian earth\" (Cimolite, p. 457), true chalk being what Pliny calls \" the inferior kind.\" Theophrastus speaks of a Tymph\u0153an gypsum (so caUed by the people of Tymph\u00e6a) which was a fuller's earth of some kind. The word yvipos is, therefore, much more likely to have been applied at times to white clays than to true chalk. The ancients were acquainted with lime from the burning of limestone, and could not have called this yiip\",. Plato's expression, T/ju 6c Sun >,cvnfj yiipov S bcvnorcpav, \" Whiter than gyp- sum or snow,\" is not improved by supposing it chalk; for there is nothing whiter than calcined gypsum, or the ceilings or ornaments made from it. Selenites (=moon-stone) of Dioscorides, which he says was also called aphroselenon (moon-froth), \" because it was found at night while the moon was on the increase,\" was probably crystallized gyp- sum or modern selenite. His description \\evx6s, Stmvyfi;, Kovjioi (=white, transparent, light), is good as far as it goes ; and the uses of the stone which he mentions also agree better with this view than with that of its being either the modern moonstone or cat's-eye, to which it has been referred. The name is from priAjjjpij, moon, and alludes probably to the peculiar moon-like white reflections. Some aggregated crystallized masses might well have suggested the name aphroselenon. It is doubtful what Pliny had in view under the name selenitis (xxxvii. 67) : it is probable, from his brevity on the subject, that he did not know the mineral. Lapis specularis (Specular-stone) of Pliny was mostly crystallized gypsum (the rest being mica), he speaks of it (xxxvi. 59) as affording by burning the best of gypsum. 'AXastacrpiriis (or alabaster-stone, meaning the stone out of which ointment vases of the kind called alabastra were made) was with Theophrastus and Pliny mainly if not wholly stalagmite, which is now often called oriental alabaster (see under Calcite) ; and Thebes in Egypt was a famous locahty. Such vases were made of other materials, and it is possible that gypsum-alabaster was one; for when polished it often resembles some clouded stalagmites. This opinion is favored \u2014 though not placed beyond question \u2014 by the statement in Theophrastus, which Pliny reiterates,* that the gypsum-stone is \"very similar to,\" \"not unlike\" (meaning in the rough state, of course) alabaslrites, which resemblance is not obvious if stalagmite is the only alabastrites. The alabas- iritis of Pliny, from Syria, said to be white spotted with various tints, may be of this kind, as Syria was noted for its gypsum-stone, according to Theophrastus and Pliny. * It is not clear that Pliny is here independent authority. He appears to be citing from Theophrastus in the most of what he says about gypsum ; and in one or two cases he cites blun deringly. He says, for instance, that plaster after hardening may by pounding be powdered [for use agafh*] ; whereas Theophrastus states more correctly that \" by burning it may again aud again be made fit for use.\""], [697, "641 HYDEOUS SULPHATES. 'AXpj\u00c6p-ptp-p-pox (alabastron) occurs as the name of alabaster-stone in the writings of the histo rian Herodianus about two centuries after Christ, but without description. The alabastrum of Pliny, something white and froth-like, called also, as he says, stimmi, stibi, and lar basis, and com ing from silver mines, cannot be alabaster. There is here probably some mistake on the part of Pliny. Burnt gypsum is called Plaster-of-Paris, becauso the Montmartre gypsum quarries, near Paris, are, and have long been, famous for affording it.

Also found at Vesuvius, at the eruptions of 1850 aud 1855. The floors of the limestone caves of Ky., Tenn., and Ind., are in many instances covered with epsomite, in minute crystals, mingled with the earth. In the Mammoth Cave, Ky., it adheres to the roof in loose masses like snowballs. At the Alum Cave, in Sevier, Tenn., on the hcadwaters of the West Fork of Little Pigeon River, masses of nearly pure epsomite, almost a cubic foot m volume, have been obtained (Saflbrd's Rep., 1 19). It effloresces from the calcareous sandstone, 10 m. from Coeymans, on the east face of the Helderberg, N. Y. Said to occur also over the Cali fornia plains, east of San Diego (Am. J.

Also effloresces from a pyritiferous serpentine in Marmora, Canada West; and on dolomites of the Clinton formation (Silurian) in sheltered places between Niagara Falls and Lake Huron, as at Dundas, where layers occur 1 in. thick. Sulphate of magnesia is dimorphous. According to Haidinger and Mitscherlich, the above described form is produced when crystallization takes place below 15\u00b0 C.

It is manufactured for the arts, and is very extensively employed in medicine aud dyeing. White vitriol, as the term is used in the arts, is the sulphate of zinc in a grauular state, like loaf sugar, produced by melting and agitation while cooling. The name Gallitzenite, which has priority, was given the mineral by Beudant from a popular German name Galitzenstein. But although so called iu Germany, zinc vitriol is not a stone from Galieia (Poland), as the word implies, while it is eminently a product of the mines of Goslar in the Harz.

Some of its foreign localities are the Rammelsberg mine near Goslar in the Harz ; Fahlun in Sweden ; at Parys mine, Anglesey ; at various mines in Co. of Wicklow ; formerly in crystals an inch long at Ting Tang mine in Gwen nap; also Rio Tinto mine, Spain. The waters of the Rio Tinto mine have yielded annually 1,800 cwt. of copper, consuming 2,400 cwt. of iron. At Wicklow about 5<>0 tous of iron were laid in the pits at one time, and in about 12 months the bars were dissolved, and each ton of iron yielded 14, to 2 tous of a reddish mud which was cement copper, containing for every ton 16 cwt. of pure copper. It has been observed at Vesuvius among the products of the eruption of 1855. Found at the lliwassee copper mine, also iu large quantities at the Isabella and other mines, iu Polk Co., Tennessee, 30 m. from Cleveland ; at the Canton mine, Georgia ; at Copiapo, Chili, with stypticite. When purified it is employed in dyeing operations, and in the printing of cotton and linen, aud for various other purposes in the arts. It is manufactured mostly from old sheathing, copper trimmings, and refinery scales. On the ancient chalcanthum see p. 645.

The other analyses agree well in the latter, and the difference is probably an error. Daviie N. Mill (Brandes Q.

Anal. 10 is of the keramohaliie of Jurasky, from near Konigsberg. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Yields water, and at a higher temperature sulphuric acid, in the closed tube. Gives a fine blue with cobalt solution. Soluble in water. Obs. \u2014 This species, a hydrous sulphate of alumina, results both from volcanic action, and the decomposition of pyrites in coal districts and alum shales, and occurs at the localities above mentioned, besides many others. The Pasto mineral was from the crater of a volcano. It has been observed by Scacchi at Vesuvius ; at Konigsberg, Hungary, it occurs in thick druses with iron vitriol. It is found as an efflorescence in numerous places in the United States. A white fibrous alunogen (?) occurs abundantly at Smoky Mtn., Jackson Co., N. C, where, it is said, tons may be obtained. Thi3 species was made known by Beudant, and by him first named Alunogen. The word is a cross between Freuch and Greek, and therefore objectionable ; but not worse than some others of minerals that are accepted. Should davite turn out to be the same thing, this name would have the precedenca in time ; but still it could not claim recognition on the basis of an analysis proved to be so greatly in error. 672.

Obs.\u2014 Forma a bed iu a feldspathic or trachytic rock, in the province of Coquimbo, about half a day's journey from Copiapo. The bed of salt is on the increase, and is probably derived from decomposing sulphids. Pits 20 ft. deep have been formed in it by the people of the country. Occurs also iu Bolivia near Calama, constituting the greater part of a large hill Observed by Scacchi about fumaroles after the eruption of Vesuvius in 1855, partly in a brownish friable crust, which, by solution and evaporation, afforded yellow hexagonal crystals ; also as a yellowish crust, in many parts tinged green, compact in texture, with the lustre of a sur face of fracture very bright. Grailich states (Ber. Ak. Wien, xxviii. 272, 1858) that a specimen of coquimbite from Copiapo in the museum at Vienna has the optical characters of his rcemerite, and therefore cannot be hexagonal, and he suggests that the two minerals may be identical.

The species hero included are not easily distinguishable by the taste or external characters, and hence early authors on minerals include all under one or two names.

The carbonates have a hardness not exceeding 5, and consequently will not, when pure, strike fire with a steel. The anhydrous come under the common general formula, RO, CO2, but present three types of crystallization, a rhombohedral, with, 7? A R near 105\u00b0 ; an orthorhombic, with 7 A 7 near 120\u00b0; and a monoclinic, with 7 A 7 near 105\u00b0. They constitute therefore a case of pleomorphism, while all, still, are approximately isomorphous. These anhydrous species have a vitreous to subpearly lustre, and are typi cally spars. The hydrous carbonates vary much in crystallization, and in some cases have a strongly pearly lustre. All effervesce in hot acids, and part of them in cold. I. ANHYDROUS CARBONATES.

Magnesia, protoxyd of iron, or protoxyd of manganese frequently, 579 and strontia, barytes, oxyd of zinc, or oxyd of lead occa sionally, replace part of the lime. The varieties are very numerous, and diverse in appear ance. They depend mainly on the following points : (1) differences in crystallization; (2) in structural condition, the extremes being perfect crystals and earthy massive forms ; (3) in color, diaphaneity, odor on friction, due to impurities ; (4) in modes of origin. The following are the most common impurities and their effects : Red oxyd of iron (Po) produces different shades of red, from flesh-red or paler to opaque blood-red and brownish red, according to the proportions present; the latter Haus- Rossie. red, according proportions present; mann names Hcematoconite (from \u00c6i^pi, blood, and ko\u201eh, powder, Handb., 1304,1847), as in the marble Rosso aniico of Italy.

Protoxyd of iron, oxyd of throme, silicate of irou, cause shades of green."], [733, "677 ANHYDEOUS CARBONATES. Carbonaceous matters, or carbon, give a clear yellowish tint to some crystallized calcite, and various dull colors, from pa.e drab aud buff through gray and bluish-gray to deep black, to com pact calcite or limestone ; the carbonaceous matters having been derived from the animals of the shells, corals, etc., out of which the limestones were originally made, or from the plants of the same seas, just as soils aud mud are now colored from the same cause ; and when these carbo naceous matters are allied to petroleum or bitumen, the rock has a fetid or bituminous odor when struck with a hammer. The fact that the dark colors mentioned are due to carbonaceous sub stances and not to metallic oxyds is proved by the rocks affording, when burnt, white quicklime. The black marbles thus colored are named Anthraconiie (from dvdpai, coal) by v. Moll (Ephemer., ii. 305, 1806), Lucullan by John (Ch. Unters., 219), and Lucullile by Jameson (Min., ii. 180, 1816); they include the Marmor Luculleum Plin. (xxxvi. 6). The Nero Antico of the Italians belongs here. The bituminous or fetid limestones are also called anthraconite when black ; and also, from the odor, Swinestone (syn. Stinkstone; Stinksiein, Saustein, Stinkkalk, Germ.), some being light gray in color. Dolomite, or carbonate of lime and magnesia, often constitutes the veins and shells of a compact limestone, as shown by Hunt; and the magnesia found by analysts in such rocks may be gen erally present as a mixture of dolomite with calcite, rather than as a chemical substitution of magnesia for lime. (See under Dolomite.) Sand, chlorite, and other minerals are sometimes taken up mechanically by crystallizing calcite. Mica, talc, chlorite, serpentine are often disseminated in crystalline limestones, having been formed in them at the time of their crystallization, and are among the materials which produce the cloudings or variegated colors of such limestones. The varieties that have been named are as follows : A. Well crystallized. 1. Ordinary. Crystals and crystallized masses afford easily cleavage rhombohedrons ; and when transparent they are what is called Iceland Spar, and also Doubly- refracting Spar (Doppel-spath Germ.). The crystals vary in proportions from broad tabidar to moderately slender acicular, and take a great diversity of forms. But the extreme kinds so pass into one another through those that are intermediate that no satisfactory classification is possible. Many are stout or short in shape because normally so. But other forms that are long tapering in their full development occur short and stout because abbreviated by an abrupt termination iu a broad o, or au obtuse rhombohe dron (as \u2014 } or R), or a low scalenohedron (as J3), or a combination of these forms ; and thus the crystals having essentially the same combinations of planes vary greatly in shape. The follow ing groups may answer some purpose in the arrangement of the crystals in a cabinet. They are here characterized by stating the form or forms that are dominant, or most largely developed; and the term abbreviated is used as above explained. Intermediate forms may be assigned to the group with which they have the most iu common. (6) o group, or flat tabular (f. 553a) ; the edges of the tables may be made of prismatic planes, or of rhombohedral, etc. (c) Low rhom bohedral or nail-head, \u2014Ji?, -\u00b1R, etc. (d) R group, the fundamental rhombohedron dominant (f. 550).

(k) Long rhombohedron abbreviated, producing some times forms that look much like 3- or 6-sided prisms (f. 553d). (/) Low scalenohedron group, 33 i\\ i2, etc. (m) Ordinary scalenohedron or dog-tooth group, that of I3, one of the most com mon of forms (f. 552a, 555-559). (n) Same abbreviated (f. 564, 565). (o) Long scalenohedron grolip, or that of I7, 1\", etc. (p) Same abbreviated, (q) Prism-scalenohedron group, the scaljnohe dral planes being combined with an oblong prism i (f. 554).

Aphrite, in its harder and more sparry variety (Schaumspaih Freiesleben), is a foliated white pearly calcite, near argentine ; iu its softer kinds (Schaumerde W., Silvery Chalk Kirwan, Ecume de Terre H.) it approaches chalk, though lighter, pearly in lustre, silvery-white or yellowish in color, soft aud greasy to the touch, and more or less scaly in structure. D. Granular massive to cryptocrystalline ; Limestone, Marble, Chalk. 19. Granular limestone (Saccharoidal limestone, so named because like loaf sugar in fracture). The texture varies from quite coarse to very fine granular, and the latter passes by imperceptible shades into compact limestone. The colors are various, as white, yellow, reddish, grij-en, and usually they are clouded and give a handsome effect when the material is polished. When such limestones are fit for polishing, or for architectural or ornamental use, they are called ma-Ales. (a) Statuary marble is pure white, fine grained, aud firm in texture. The Parian marble from the island of Paros (the Lychnises of the ancients), Penlelican from the quarries near Athens, Luni marbles of the coast Of Tuscauy, and the Carrara, of Modeua, Italy, are among the best of statu ary marbles. Architectural marble includes both white and colored, (o) The Cipolin of Italy is white, with pale greenish shadings from green talc ; it does not stand the weather well, (c) Giallo antico of Italy is ochre-yellow to cream-yellow, with some whitish spots, (d) The Sienna, ot Brocatello de Sienna, is yellow, veined or clouded with bluish-red. having sometimes a tinge of pur ple, (e) The Mandelato is a light red witli yellowish-white spots. A red kind from Tireo in Scot land has different shades of red, as rose-red, flesh-red, reddish-white; one from Tennessee ia clouded with brownish- and purplish-red. (/) The Bardiglio is gray with crowded dark well-defined cloudings, consisting partly of serpentine, from Corsica, (g) Turquois-blue marble, from the quar ries of Seravezza near Carrara, has a fine grayish-blue color, veined with white. (/**\u25a0) Verd- A >diqut is clouded green, the color, owing to the presence of serpentine (see p. 465), yellowish-green to Dluish-green. 20. Hard compact limestone. Varies from nearly pure white, through grayish, drab, bufl; j-ellowish, and reddish shades, to bluish-gray, dark brc wish-gray, and black, and sometimes"], [735, "679 ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. \u25a0Tariously veined. The colors dull, excepting ochre-yellow and ochre-red varieties. Many kinds make beautiful marble when polished. (o) Black, (b) yellow, (c) red, and (d) fetid kiuds have been mentioned (pp. 670, 677). The Porter (d), called sometimes Egyptian marble, is of black color, handsomely veined with yellow dolomite, and comes from Porto- Venere, near Spezia ; the rock is of the lower Lias, (e) Panw-di-Morte (Doath's Robe) of Italy is black, with some white fossil shells. (/) Marble of Languedoc is fine deep red or brownish-red, with some white and gray due to fossils, and is from St. Beaume in France, (g) Griotie, from the Dept. of Herault, France, has a reddish-brown base, with somewhat regularly arranged spots of clear red, and some whitish round spots due to gonia tites. (h) Sarencclin marble, from the Pyrenees, is deep red mixed with gray and yellow, (i) Bird's-eye marble is gray, with whitish crystalline points, and is from central New York . (it) Sliell-marble includes kinds consisting largely of fossil shells ; (I) Madreporic marble, those containing corals ; (m) Encrinal, those containing encrinal (crinoidal) remains, (n) Lumachelle is a dark brown shell-marble, with brilliant fire-like or chatoyant internal reflections proceeding from the shells, and from Bleiberg in Carinthia ; and another kind, with the shells yellow, comes front Astrachan. (o) Ruin-marble is a kind of compact calcareous marl, showing, when polished, pictures of fortifications, temples, etc., in ruins, due to infiltration of oxyd of iron : from Florence, Italy. (p) Lithographic stone is a very even-grained compact limestone, usually of buff or drab color; as that of Solenhofen. (q) Breccia marble is made of fragments of limestone cemented together, and is often very beautiful when the fragments are of different colors, or are imbedded in a base that contrasts well. The colors are very various. (r) Pudding-stone marble consists of pebbles or rounded stones cemented. It is often called improperly breccia marble. (s) Hydraulic limestone is an impure limestoue. The French varieties contain 2 or 3 p. c. of magnesia, and 10 to 20 of silica and alumina (or clay). The varieties in the United States contain 20 to 40 p. c. of magnesia, and 12 to 30 p. c. of silica and alumina. A variety worked extensively at Rondout, N. Y., afforded Professor Beck (Min. N. Y., 78) Carbonic acid 34-20, lime 25-50, magnesia 12*35, silica 15*37, alumina 9\"13, sesquioxyd of iron 2*25. Oxyd of iron is rather prejudicial to it than otherwise. Yicat observes that in the best Frencli there are 20 to 30 p. c. of clay, and in that only moderately good 10 to 12 p. c. Au impure limestone of France, which needs no sand for making the cement, it containing calcite 54 p. c, clay 31, oxyd of iron 15=100, is called plaster cement (Dufr. Min., ii.). 21. soft compact limestone, (a) Chalk is white, grayish-white, or yellowish, and soft enough to leave a trace on a board. The consolidation into a rock of such softness may be owing to the fact that the material is largely the hollow shells of rhizopods. The creta of the Romans (usually translated chalk) was mostly a white clay, true chalk being little known to the ancients. The kind described by Pliny as the most inferior kind of cretaceous earth, and as used for marking the feet of slaves, was probably true chalk. (b) Calcareous marl (Mergelkalk Germ.) is a soft earthy deposit, often hardly at all consolidated, with or without distinct fragments of shells ; it generally contains much clay, aud graduates into a calcareous clay. 22. Concretionary massive, (a) Oolite (Rogenstein Germ.) is a granular limestone, but its grains are minute rounded concretions, looking somewhat like the roe of fish, the name coming from 'uojp, egg. It occurs among all the geological formations, from the Lower Silurian to the most recent, and it is now forming about the coral reefs of Florida, (b) Pisolite (Erbsenstein W.) con sists of concretions as large often as a small pea, or even larger, the concretions having usually a distinct concentric structure. It is formed in large masses in the vicinity of the Hot Springs at Carlsbad in Bohemia. 23. Deposited from calcareous springs, streams, or in caverns, etc. (a) Stalactites are the calcareous cylinders or cones that hang from the roofs nf limestone caverns, and which are formed from the waters that drip through the roof; these waters hold some bicarbonate of lime in solution, and leave carbonate of lime to form the stalactito when evaporation takes place. Stalactites vary from transparent to nearly opaque ; from a granular crystalline structure to a radiating fibrous ; from a white color and colorless to yellowish-gray and brown. (b) Stalagmite is the same material covering the floors of caverns, it being made from the waters that drop from the roofs, or from sources over the bottom or sides ; cones of it sometimes rise from the floor to meet the stalactites above. It consists of layers ; but these are very irreg ularly curved, or bent, owing to the knobs and conelets that are made over the floor; and polished specimens generally owe much of their beauty to the agate-like or onyx-like bandings. Stalagmite is the Alabaslrites (alabaster-stoue) in part (if not wholly) of Theophrastus, Pliny and other ancient writers ; that is, the stone of which ointment vases, of a certain form callec alabasters, were made. (See Gtpsum, p. 640.) A locality near Thebes, now well known, was"], [736, "680 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. largely explored by the ancients, and the material has often been hence called Egyptian alabaster It was also formerly called onyx and onychites; Horace, in the 3d book of his Odes, speaks of ac \u25a0jintment vase of onyx. Pliny mentions columns of '-onyx,\" or \"alabastrites,\" that were 32 ft in height, aud mentions Damascus as affording a kind whiter than that of Thebes. In the arts it is often now called Oriental Alabaster ; and sometimes also Gibraltar-stone, from the occurrence of the material in a cavern at Gibraltar. (c) Calc-sinter, Travertine, Calc Tufa. Travertine ( Confelio di Tivoli) is of essentially the same origin with stalagmite, but is distinctively a deposit from springs or rivers, especially where in large deposits, as aloug the river Anio, at Tivoli, near Rome, where the deposit is scores of feet in thickness. It has a very cavernous and irregularly banded structure, owing to its mode of formation. It is the Lapis Tiburtinus ot Vitruvius, ii. c. 7, and Pliny, xxxvi. 48, etc. ; the word travertine being a corruption of tiburtine. It includes also, especially under the name of calc tufa, cellular depositions from the waters of small springs or sources, which often contain fossil leaves, twigs, moss, nuts or seed, etc. The Osteocollus (Beinwelle, Beinbruch) Gesner (p. 31, 1565), \"qui ossa fracta intra corpus sumptus,\" as was thought at the time (osteocolla of later authors), is, as long since shown, a cellular calc tufa, consisting of incrustings of fragments of reeds or other marsh plants. It means bone-glue. Inolile, GaUitzin, is also calc-sinter. (d) Agaric mineral; Rock-milk (Bergrailch, Montmilch, Germ.) is a very soft, white material, breaking easily in the fingers, deposited sometimes in caverns, or about sources holding lime in solution. (e) Rock-meal (Berg-mehl Germ., Farina fossilis Bruckm., etc.) is white and light, like cotton, becoming a powder ou the slightest pressure. It is an efflorescence, and is common near Paris, especially at the quarries of Nanterre. Analyses: 1, 2, Stromeyer (Gilb.

Obs. \u2014 Andreasberg in the Harz is one of the best European localities of crystallized calcito"], [737, "ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. 681 there are other localities in the Tyrol, Styria, Carinthia, Hungary, Saxony, Hesse Darmstadt (a< Auerbach), Hesse Cassel, Norway, France, and in England in Dei byshire, Cumberland, Cornwall, Scotland ; in Iceland. In Iceland a single rhombohedron (R) over 6 yds. long and 3 high has been observed. In the U. States, in K York, in St. Lawrence and Jefferson Cos., especially at the Rossie lead mine ; crystals highly modified (f. 560, 561), and often transparent even when large ; one nearly trans parent, in the cabinet of Yale College, weighing 1 65 pounds ; often covered in part by crystals of galenite ; at the Natural Dam, 2 m. from Gouverneur, iu the same vicinity, good crystals ; also at the Wilson vein in Gouverneur, and the Jepson veiu in Rossie ; at the Parish ore bed in Gouver neur, fine geodes, in specular iron ; in Jefferson Co., near Oxbow, on the laud of Mr. Benton, from a decomposing limestone, largo crystals sometimes as clear as Iceland spar ; rose and purple varieties very beautiful ; some large crystals of a hundred lbs. aud upward ; 4. m.

(f. 552c) ; at Anthony's Nose on the Hudson, formerly groups of large tabular crystals (f. 553a) ; at Watertowu, Agaric mineral, covering the sides of a cave; at Schoharie, fine stalactites in many caverns, of which Ball's cave is the most famous ; at Camillus and Schoharie (near the barite locality), fibrous, in considerable abundance, and at De Long's Mill, St Lawrence Co., of a fine satin lustre. In Maine, at Thomaston, lenticular and prismatic crystals, common. In N. Hamp., at the iron mines, Fran conia, argentine. In Mass., at Williamsburg and Southampton, argentine. In Conn., at the lead mine, Middletown, in crystals (i-2, -}, I, short or long, and I3, R). In N. Jersey, at Bergen, fiue crystallizations of yellow calcite, with datolite, etc., in trap (f. 552b) ; at Franklin, a pink variety, and good cleavage specimens. In Penn., in York Co., Iceland spar. Iu Virginia, at the celebrated Wier's cave, stalactites of great beauty; also iu the large caves of Kentucky. At the Lake Supe rior copper mines, splendid crystals often containing scales of native copper. At Warsaw, Illinois, in great variety of form, lining geodes and implanted on quartz crystals ; at Quincy, 111 In Nova Scotia, at Partridge I., a wine-eolored calcite, and other interesting varieties. Corals, of which large reefs are formed in tropical regions, consist mainly of carbonate of lime. B. Silliman, Jr., obtained for a recent species of Madrepora (Dana's Report on Zoophytes, and also Am. J. Sci., II. i. 189) Carbonate of lime 94'807, phosphates, fluorids, etc., 0-745, organic mat ter 4*448. And the deposit of phosphates and fluorids afforded the percentage \u2014 Si 12-5, Ca 7\"5, Mg 4-2, Mg F 26-62, Ca F 26-34, Mg P 8*00, Al and te 14-84. Other analyses gave similar results. The material of the common marbles is either granular or compact limestone. These rocks when burnt form quicklime.* Alt. \u2014 Calcite occurs under the forms of dolomite, calamine, spathic iron, malachite, azurite, gypsum, smithsonite, barite, fluorite, limonite, gothite, red iron ore, minium, meerschaum, chlo rite, quartz, chalcedony, garnet, feldspar, mica, pyrolusite, hausmannite, manganite, marcasite, galenite, blende, native copper. The change to dolomite, as Bisehof explains, may take place through bicarbonate of magnesia in solution ; to spathic iron (Fe C) through sulphate of iron iu solution, forming sulphate of lime and carbonate of iron ; or by carbonated waters containing bicarbonate of iron, which slowly dissolve calcite, while the carbonate of iron takes its place, forming a pseudomorph by substitution ; to smitlisonite (2uC) through sulphate of zinc in solu tion; to calamine (2n3Si+14 fi) probably by a change first to ZnG and then to the silicate, through alkaline silicates in solution ; to malachite through a solution of sulphate of copper, which forms carbonate of copper and sulphate of lime ; to gypsum or anhydrite through the action of sulphuric acid, which acid is produced by the oxydatiou of sulphuretted hydrogen or otherwise, thus forming sulphate of lime; to quartz by waters containing alkaline silicates, which afford free silica ; to fluorite, limonite, and other species, by the removal of the Ca C by waters which hold carbonic acid or alkaline silicates, and at the same time contain the ingredients forming the replacing mineraL Limonite or red iron ore might result from the decomposition of pyrite in the vicinity. Hollow scalenohedrons from the province of Arnsberg were found by Niiggerath (Verh. nat. Ver. Bonn, 1863, 137) to consist of an exterior coating of azurite, and an interior layer of malachite. \"716.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Normal or true dolomite has the formula Ca C + Mg 0=Carbonatc of lime 54*36, carbonate of magnesia 45*05. Some kinds included under the name have the two carbonates in other proportions ; but this may arise from their being mixtures of dolomite with calcite or mag nesite. Protoxyd of iron replaces part of the magnesia in some dolomite ; so also protoxyd of manganese ; and more rarely oxyd of cobalt or zinc. The varieties are the following : (1) Crystallized. Pearl spar includes rhombohedral crystallizations with curved faces. (2) Columnar or fibrous. Miemite, from Miemo, Tuscany, is either in crystals, columnar, or granular, and pale asparagus green in color. (3) Granular, or saccharoid, constitutes many ofthe kinds of white statuary marble, and white and colored architectural marbles, names of some of which have been mentioned under calcite. (4) Compact massive, like ordinary limestone. Many of the limestone strata of the globe are here included, and much hydraulic limestone, noticed under calcite. (5) Compact porcellanous, Gurhofian; snow-white and subtranslucent, with a conchoidal frac ture, sometimes a little opal-like; from Gurhof, in lower Austria. (6) Ferriferous; Brown spar, in part. Contains carbonate of iron, and as the proportion increases it graduates into ankerite (q. v.). The color is white to brown, and becomes brownish on expo sure through the oxydation of the iron. A columnar kind, containing 10 p. c. of carbonate of iron, has been called Brossite (anal. 19); G.=2 915. Tharandite, from Tharand, near Dresden, is crystallized, and contains 4 p. c. of Fe.

Very many of the limestone strata of the globe are thus partly or wholly dolomitio, though usually not as pure as in the above analyses. T. S Hunt says that dolomites make up the chief part of the Calciferous, Clinton, Trenton, Guc-lph, Niagara, and Onondaga limestones of Canada (Logan's Rep., 1863, 456). In 1857 (Logan's Rep., 1857, 200) ho announced that the veins and shells of some ordinary limestones were magnesian. In the Portor marble (p. 679) the body of the rock contains only 1-0 p. c. of carbonate of magnesia, aud the veins 35-5 p. c. A limestone from Dudswell, Canada, contains CaO 92-5, MgO 1-3, sand 6-2; and the fossils are of similar composition ; but a yellowish material enveloping the fossils and filling veins consists of Ca 0 56-60, MgO 11-76, FeO 3-23, with 26*72 inso;uble=9S-3l. This being a mixture of dolomite and calcite, the latter was removed by acetic acid, and the residue, 52 p. c, then afforded Ca 0 51-75, MgO 35-73, Fe 0 12*52=100. In the Trenton limestone of Ottawa, the fossil corals, shells, and crustaceans are changed to whitish dolomite ; and a fragment of an Orthoceras gave CaO 56*00, MgO 37*80, Fe 0 5*95 = 99-75. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. acts like calcite, but does not give a clear mass when fused with soda on platinum foil. Fragments thrown into cold acid are very slowly acted upou, while in powder in warm acid the mineral is readily dissolved with effervescence. The ferriferous dolomites become brown ou exposure. Obs. \u2014 Massive dolomite constitutes extensive strata, called limestone strata, in various regions. Crystalline and compact varieties are often associated with serpentine and other magnesian rocks, and with ordinary limestones. Some of the prominent localities are at Salzburg, the Tyrol, Schemnitz in Hungary, Kapnik in Transylvania, Freiberg in Saxony, the lead mines at Alston in Derbyshire, etc. In the U. States, in Vermont, at Roxbury, large, yellow, tr*ansparent crystals ofthe rhomb-spar variety, in talc. In Rhode Island, at Smithfield, a coarse cleavable variety, occasionally presenting perfect crystals, with white talc in calcite. In N. Jersey, at Hoboken, white hexagonal crystals (f. 580). and in rhombohedrons. In N. York, at Lockport, Niagara Falls, and Rochester, with calcite, celestite, and gypsum ; also at Glenn's Falls ; in Richmond Co., at the quarantine, crys tallized dolomite, in rhombohedrons, and at the Parish ore bed. St. Lawrence Co. ; on Hustis's farm in Phillipstown, a variety resembling Gurhofite, with a semi-opaline appearance aud a fracture nearly like porcelain. Dolomite is generally supposed to be injurious as a manure for soils, on account of its magnesia ; but this is not so, unless used after calcination, before it is fully air-slaked. The lime it aflords when burnt makes a more durable cement thau common limestone. Named after Dolomieu, who announced some ofthe marked characteristics of the rock in 1791 \u2014 its not effervescing with acids, while burniug like limestone, and soluble after heating in acids. He observes in his paper that, as early as 1786, he had found the white marble of many of the ancient statues and monuments of Italy to consist of this peculiar rock : and eighteen months before the date of his paper he discovered \" immense quantities of similar limestones \" in the Tyrol. Woulfe, iu the Phil Trans. for 1779 (at p. 29), describes a ferriferous dolomite or ankerite, with some analytical determinations, which was in pearly rhombohedrons, resembling somewhat those cf spathic iron, and came from Joachimsthal. \" In its natural state \" it effervesced strongly with \" rectified \" muriatic acid, which would indicate the presence of more iron than he obtained (5 oi 6 p. c. of Fe O, C On). It may have been ankerite.

S. Hunt (Logan's Rep., 1863, 457, 611) found the magnesite rock of Canada to contain 8 to 104/ p. c. of carbonate of iron, with 8 to 40 p. c. of insoluble matters, mostly mixed quarts That of Sutton afforded Mg 0 83-35, Fe 0 902, mixed silica 8*03=100*40. The white portions of tho verd-antique of Roxbury, Mass., are magnesite with about 4 p. c. of carbonate of iron, as shown by Jackson, Hayes, and Hunt. In the baudisserite, Berthier found 0 41*80, Mg 39*00, meerschaum 19*20 = 100 (Ann. d. M, 1822, 316). A variety of the same was eariy analyzed by Giobert (J. d. M., xx. 291, 401, 1803), and another, from Castellamonte, by Guyton (Ann. d. Ch., xlvii. 85, 1803). A magnesite from Sasbach. Kaiserstuhl, contains hydromagnesite. P. Meyer found (Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxv. 129), after separating the impurities, C 45'27, Mg 47*69, Ca 2-47, fl 4*57, equivalent tc MgC 82*88, CaO 4*41, Mg 8*14, fl4*57.

Obs. \u2014 Found in talcose schist, serpentine, and other magnesian rocks ; as veins in serpentine, or mixed with it so as to form a variety of verd-antique marble (magnesitic ophiolite of Hunt; ; also, in Canada, as a rock, more or less pure, associated with steatite, serpentine, and dolomite. The breunerite variety has been found in a meteorite from Orgueil (Descl). Occurs at Hrubschiitz in Moravia, where it was first discovered by Mitchell ; at Kraubat and Tragossthal, Styria; at Frankenstein in Silesia ; Snarum, Norway ; Baudissero and Castellamonte in Piedmont ; at other localities above mentioned. In America, at Bolton, Mass., in indistinctly fibrous masses, traversing white limestone ; at Lynnfield, Cavendish, and Roxbury, Mass., mixed with or veining serpentine ; at Barehills, near Baltimore, Md. ; in Penn., in crystals at West Goshen, Chester Co. ; near Texas, Lancaster Co. ; as a rock, iu Sutton and Bolton, Canada East ; in Cantou Upata, Venezuela, near Mission Pastora, looking like porcelain in the fracture, as observed by N. S. Manross : in Tulare, Alameda, Mariposa, aud Tuolumue Cos., California. Delametherie, in his Theorie de la Terre, ii. 93, 1795, uses the name magnesite for the carbonate of magnesia, sulphate, nitrate, and muriate, and tho carbonate is placed first in the series. Brong niart, in his Mineralogy, ii. 489, 1807, applies the name to a group, including (1) the carbonate called MitcheWs magnesite, (2) meerschaum, (3) the Piedmont magnesite, and (4) other siliceous varieties. As both Brongniart and Delametherie gave the first place to the carbonate, the name magnesite would rightly fall to it in case of tho division of the group. Karsten, in his Tabellen, 1808, recognized this division of the species, and formally gave to the carbonate the name mag fiesite. The German mineralogists have followed Karsten, as should have been done by all. But in France, Beudant, in 1824, gave the name giobertite to the carbonate, leaving magnesite for the silicate, and most of the French mineralogists have followed Beudant. Giobert analyzed only the siliceous variety from Baudissero, the true composition ofthe mineral having been ascertained by Lampadius, somewhat earlier, from specimens brought by Mitchell from Moravia. 719.

With the fluxes reacts for iron, and with soda and nitre on platiuum foil generally gives a manganese reaction. Only slowly acted upon by cold acid, but dissolves with brisk effervescence in hot muriatic acid. Exposure to the atmo sphere darkens its color, rendering it often of a blackish-brown or brownish-red color. Obs. \u2014 Siderite occurs in many of the rock strata, in gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and as clay iron stone in connection with the Coal formation and many other stratified deposits. It is often associ ated with metallic ores. At Freiberg it occurs in silver mines. In Cornwall it accompanies tin. It is also found accompanying copper and iron pyrites, galenite, vitreous copper, etc. In New York, according to Beck, it is almost always associated with specular iron. Occasionally it is to be met with in trap rocks as spherosiderite. In the region in and about Styria and Oariuthia this ore forms extensive tracts in gneiss, which extend along the chain of the Alps, on one side iuto Austria, and on the other into Salzburg. At Harzgerode in the Harz, it occurs in fine crystals in gray-wacke ; also in Cornwall, Alston-Moor and Devonshire. The Spherosiderite occurs in greenstone at Hanau, Steinheim, and Dransberg, and many other places. Clay iron-stone, which is a siliceous or argillaceous carbonate of iron, occurs in coal beda near Glasgow ; also at Mouillar, Magescote, etc., in France, etc. In the United States, in Vermont, at Plymouth.

Named Spherosiderite by Hausmann in 1813, from the concretionary variety, and retained by him for the whole. Haidinger reduced the name to Siderite, the prefix sphero being applicable only to an unimportant variety. Beudant's name Siderosc has an unallowable termination. Chalybile, Glocker, should yield to Haidinger's earlier name siderite, as recognized by v. Kobell and Kenngott. Alt.\u2014 Spathic iron becomes brown or brownish-black on exposure, owing to a peroxydation of the iron and its passing to limonite (Fe2fl3) ; and by a subsequent loss of water, it may pass to red iron ore or specular iron (te), or to magnetite (Fo te). the last at times a result of deoxydation of Pe by organic substances. It also changes by substitution, or through the action of alkaline silicates, to quartz. 722. RHODOCHROSITE. Magnesium acido aereo mineralisatum Bergm., Sciagr., 1782 (with- out descr. or loc).

B.B. infusible ; moistened with cobalt solution and heated in O.F. gives a green color ou cooling. With soda on charcoal gives zinc vapors, and coats the coal yellow while hot, becoming white on cooling ; this coating, moistened with cobalt solution, gives a green color after heating in O.F. Cadmiferous varieties, when treated with soda, give at first a deep yellow or brown coating before the zinc coating appears. With the fluxes some varieties react for iron, copper, and manganese. Soluble in muriatic acid with effervescence. Obs.\u2014 Smithsonite is found both in veins and beds, especially in company with galenite and blende ; also with copper and iron ores. It usually occurs in calcareous rocks, and is generally associated with calamine, and sometimes with limonite. It is often produced by the action of Bulphate of zinc upon carbonate of lime or magnesia. Found at Nertschinsk in Siberia, one variety of a dark brown color, containing cadmium, another of a beautiful bright green; at Dognatzka in Hungary; Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia; Wiesloch in Baden, in Triassic limestone ; Moresnet in Belgium ; Altenberg, near Aix la Chapelle (Aachen), in concentric botryoidal groups.' In the province of Santander, Spain, between the Bay of Biscay and the continuation of the Pyreuees range, at Puente Viesgo, the mountains being only four leagues from the coast ; the smithsonite here occurs in mountain limestone ; in other places it is found in dolomite, probably muschelkalk ; it is in vertical lodes, found fre- quently in scalenohedrons as a pseudomorph after calcite. At Ciguenza, 5 miles E. of Santan- der, the lode varies in width from 1 to 2 meters to 1 inch; the mineral is drusy, cavernous; blende is abundant, and changes into pure white smithsonite ; the latter also occurs like chalce- dony, in reniform and botryoidal masses ; it sometimes contains galena and cerussite. In Eng- land, at Roughteu Gill, Alston Moor, near Matlock, in the Mendip Hills, and elsewhere; in Scotland, at Leadhills ; in Ireland, at Donegal. Iu the U. States, in Conn., at Brookfield in very small quantities. In N. Jersey, at Mine Hill, near the Franklin furnace, only pulverulent from decomposition of zincite. In Penn., at Lancas- ter abundant, and often in fine druses of crystals, also sometimes pseudomorphous after dolo mite ; at the Perkiomen lead mine ; at the Ueberroth mine, near Bethlehem, in scalenohedrons, also an earthy variety abundant as au ore.

In Missouri and Arkansas, along with the load ores in Lower Silurian line stone. Alt Smithsonite changes through the action of alkaline silicates to calamine (Zn-* Si -Hi ft); or becomes incrusted with silica and form3 quartz pseudomorphs. It is also sometimes replace? by limonite or gothite. The concretionary variety from Spain has a nucleus of calamine. 724. ARAGONITE.

Kirwan suggested in 1794 that the prismatic form was due to the presence of strontia, which Stromeyer disproved in 1813. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. whitens and faUs to pieces, and sometimes, when containing strontia, imparts a more intensely red color to the flame than lime ; otherwise reacts like calcite. Obs. \u2014 The most common repositories of aragonite are beds of gypsum, beds of iron ore (where it occurs in coraUoidal forms, and is denominated flos-ferri, \"flower of iron \"), basalt, and trap rock ; occasionally it occurs in lavas. It is often associated with copper and iron pyrites, galenite, and malachite. It is forming at an old mine in Monte Vasa, Italy, at a temperature below the boiling point of water. It constitutes the pearly layer of sheUs. Minute pointed crystals occur in drusy cavities in the sinter of the thermal springs of Baden. First discovered in Aragon, Spain (whence its name, the word in Spain having but one r), at Molina and Valencia, near MigranUla, in six-sided prisms, with gypsum, imbedded in a ferruginous clay. Since found at Bilin in Bohemia, in a vein traversing basalt in fine prisms ; at Breisgau in Baden ; at Baumgarten and Tarnowitz iu SUesia ; at Leogang ia Salzburg, Austria ; in Waltsch, Bohemia, and many other places. The flos-ferri variety is found in great perfection in the Sty rian mines, coating cavities and even caves of considerable extent, and associated with spathic iron. At Dufton, a sUky, fibrous variety, called satin spar, occurs traversing shalo in thin veins, generally associated with pyrite. In Buckinghamshire, Devonshire, etc., it occurs in stalactitic forms in caverns, and of snowy whiteness at LeadhiUs in Lanarkshire."], [753, "697 ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. Aragonite in fibrous crus.s and other forms occurs in serpentine at Hoboken, N J. (it has been called maguesite). Coralloidal aragonite occurs sparingly at Lockport, N. Y., coating gypsum iu geodes ; at Edenville, N. Y., fining cavities of arsenopyrite and cube ore ; at the Parish ore bed, Rossie, N. Y. ; at Haddam, Conn., in thin seams between layers of gneiss ; at New Garden in Chester Co., Penn. ; at Wood's Mine, Lancaster Co., Penn. ; at Warsaw, 111, lining geodes ; oil the north boundary of the Creek nation, 16 m. from the crossing of the Arkansas, in hexagonal crystals nearly <\u25a0} in. through. Alt. \u2014 Aragonite may undergo similar changes with calcite. It also passes to calcite, through paramorphism.

Soluble in dilute muriatic acid ; this solution, even when very much diluted, gives with sulphuric acid a white precipitate which is insoluble in acids. Obs. \u2014 Occurs at Alston-Moor in Cumberland, associated with galenite, in veins traversing the coal formation ; at Fallowfield near Hexham in Northumberland, in splendid crystals, sometimes transparent, and occasionally 6 in. long ; at Anglezarke in Lancashire, a fibrous variety ; at Arken dale in Yorkshire ; near St. Asaph in Flintshire ; Tarnowitz in Silesia ; Szlana, Hungary ; Leo gang in Salzburg ; Peggau in Styria; Zmeoff in the Altai; some places in Sicily; the mine of Arqueros, near Coquimbo, Chili ; L.

The compound ordinarily called bicarbonate of lime. The mineral is known only as a mixture in collyrite, a hydrous silicate of alumina. J. H. & G. Gladstone state (1. e.) that there is carbonic acid enough in the collyrite to form a bicarbonate with the lime present ; but this view of the composition is set aside because of the solubility of the so-called bicarbonate, and its being unknown in the solid state ; and hence they suggest that the excess of carbonic acid may be combined in the mineral with alumina, making a hydrous carbonate of alumina and lime, or perhaps replaces part of the silica in the alumina silicate. But although the bicarbonate referred to is known only in solution, the most likely condition for finding it in the mineral kingdom is in one of the hydrous silicates of alumina, like collyrite, in which there is present much water, loosely held ; the mineral therefore, is most probably a carbonate of the formula above given ; especially since a carbonate in which Al or Pe enters is, as the authors admit, yet unknown to chemistry.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs at most mines of zinc, and is a result of the alteration of the other ores of this metal. Found in great quantities at the Dolores mine, TJdias valley, province of Santander, in Spain, along with calamine, smithsonite, and blende, covering the floor of an extensive cavern to a depth of a yard and a half, and hanging in dazzling white branching stalactites from the roof; part is concretionary, pisolitic, nodular; it is intimately mixed with silicate of zinc, and is pseudomor phous after it; and opal-like masses of silicate and hydrous carbonate are common, formed by the falling of drops of water holding the silicate in solution. Also occurs in the neighboring province of Guipuzcoa, Spain, near La Nestosa, at the mines of Las Nieves and La Augustina ; at Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia ; near Reimsbeck, in West phalia ; in Hollenthal, on the Zugspitze in Bavaria ; at Taft in the province of Jesd in Persia. In the U States, at Friedensville, Pa. ; at Linden, in Wisconsin, as a concretionary fibrous white crust on smithsonite ; in Marion Co., Arkansas (marionile), in concentric and contorted lamin\u00e6 and botryoidal crusts. Beudant's name zinconise, from zinc and kovis, powder, has priority, but is too badly formed to be retained. Artif. \u2014 Deposited when hot solutions of zinc salts in water are decomposed by carbonates of the alkalies. The white substance formed on zinc, when moistened and exposed to the air, is a related compound, containing, according to Bonsdorff, 0 14*19, 2n 71*25, fl 14 56=100, agreeing with Smithson's analysis above. 750.

Obs. \u2014 Aurichalcite occurs at Loktefskoi, at a copper mine of the Altai, where it is associated with calcite and limonite, sometimes forming a drusy covering upon these minerals ; at Matlock, in Derbyshire, of a pale green color, laminated structure, and pearly lustre ; at Roughten-Gill, in Cumberland; Leadhills, Scotland; zinc mines of the province of Santander, Spain. In the U. Stales, at Lancaster, Pa. (Taylor, Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 412). The buratite comes from Loktefskoi ; Chessy, near Lyons ; Framont, Tyrol ; Retzbanya, in Hungary, in microscopic rhombic or rhombohedral tables, and also oblong rectangular forms (a mineral lately proved to be calciferous) ; Campiglia in Tuscany. The mineral aurichalcite was first described as a greenish variety of calamine by Patrin, iu 1788 (1 c), and called Brass ore (Mine de Laiton), \"because,\" as he says, \"the compound of copper and zinc is here made by nature.\" Amoug the brass or copper ores of the ancients, auricholcum was reputed the best (I'liny, xxxiii. 2); and Sage was thence led to suggest (1. c, 1791) that the cupriferous calamine (which afforded, as he showed by experiment, the best of brass, without the addition of either copper or zinc) might be the ancient auricholcum. As the ore is a scarce one, this is not at all probable. But the idea explains the use ofthe word for the species. In addition, it is to be said that brass (or an alloy related to it) was called aurichalcum by \"Virgil and Horace, and also in the middle ages. The Latin word aurichalcum is regarded by some good authorities as derived from 'opii^aXKas (=mountain brass); and, in fact, the Latin poets just mentioned wrote it orichalcum. But others regard it as a hybrid word (from the Latin aurum, gold, and x\"l\"\">h brass or bronze), and the o of the poets as an example of the admissible change in Latin of au to o. Glocker, in view of the first of these derivations, changes aurichalcite to orichalcite ; but, whatever the derivation, as the use of aurichalcum dates from before Pliny's time, we moderns may as well let it stand without correction. 1S0k. Zinkazurite Breith., B. H. Ztg., 1852, 101. A blue mineral in small crystals, having l}.=3-49, from the Sierra Almagrera in Spain.

Mineral Coal The formulas above are all written on the new system. If the number connected with H ij halved in each case, and the barred capitals are replaced by common capitals, they will then con form to the old system. The native hydrocarbons are very imperfectly known. Most of the kinds hitherto recognized in mineralogy are more analogous to rocks than minerals. Amber, for example, instead of being a species, is a mixture of four or more species, as Berzelius long since pointed out, and only two of tho number have thus far been investigated. The presence of succinic acid, one of these two, is spoken of as an essential constituent and distinguishing feature of amber : and this it is ; but only in the way that faldspar is a constituent of granite. Petroleum, Asphaltum, and the various kinds of mineral resins and wax are similar mixtures, in the fight of chemistry, as has been shown by many investigators. But still the true line of investigation is so little appreciated that new resins or asphalts are from time to time brought forward as species in mineralogy upon characters that only prove them to be mixtures. And chemistry, while working toward a better state of this department of mineralogy, often fails in its researches to distinguish educts (native ingredients) from products. The facts in the case, and the true idea of the science, sustain the course of the author in here removing amber from mineralogical species, and calling, not amber, but the insoluble resin which constitutes four-fifths of its mass, succinite; and in endeavoring to apply the same method throughout the hydrocarbon section. Much more investigation is demanded before satisfactory results can in all cases be attained. But by pursuing the subject iu tho way here recognized, the section will ultimately become an exhibition of the actual species of hydrocarbons in nature and thus lie elevated to the same level with other parts of the science."], [779, "723 SIMPLE HYDEOCAEBONS.

Those in the table are derived from the Greek for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and were proposed by Gerhardt. The constitution of petroleum has been investigated by various chemists, among whom the most prominent are Pelouze and Cahours (C. R., liv. 1 24, lvi. 505, lvii. 62), and C. M. Warren (Mem. Am. Ac. Boston, II. ix. x., Am. J. Sci., II. xl. xiv. xlvi.). Pelouze and Cahours continue the naphtha series to *Gi6H32, and state evidence of the existence of still higher members. But Warren arrived at the conclusion that the naphtha or marsh-gas series terminates with B, H20, and that the oils of higher density and atomic numbers belong to the ethylene series (Ba H2\u00bb ). More over, Warren brought out the fact that there was a second naphtha group, differing from the other in its higher boiling points \u2014 the Beta-naphtha group above. This chemist also determined with great exactness the boiling points of the two groups, and found that in both there was the"], [780, "724 HYDEOCAEBON COMPOUNDS. \u25a0common difference of about 30\u00b0C. for successive terms in the series (or for a differenco of 6 H2) ; but that the boiling points in the second serie3 were about 8\u00b0 higher correlatively than those of the 1 st series, as the tables show. The specific gravities and vapor densities for 761 are from Ronalds. Those of the others, 76*2 to 772, are from Warren, excepting the vapor densities of 762, 763. The vapor density of 767 has not yet been determined. Warren's specific gravities were taken at 0\u00b0 C. Ronalds has observed that the gaseous compounds of tho marsh-gas series \u20ac*. HB and B3 He (2d and 3d terms in the marsh-gas series) also exist in connection with petroleum. Marsh-gas itself, the first term in the series CH,, is a very common gas of coal beds and bituminous depos its, as well as of modern marshes. Petroleum passes by insensible gradations into piiiasphalt or maltha (viscid bitumen) ; and the latter as iusensibly into asphalt or solid bitumen. Petroleum occurs in rocks or deposits of nearly all geological ages, from the Lower Silurian to tho present epoch. It is associated most abundantly with argillaceous shales and sandstones, but is found also permeatiug limestones, giving them a bitumiuous odor, and rendering them sometimes a considerable source of oil. From these oleiferous shales and limestones the oil often exudes, and appears floating on the streams or lakes of the region, or rises in oil springs. It also exists collected in subterranean cavities in certain rocks, whence it issues in jets or fountains whenever an outlet is made by boring. These cavities are situated mostly along the course of gentle anticlinals in the rocks of the region ; and it is therefore probable, as has been suggested, that they originated for the most part in the displacements of the strata caused by the slight uplift. The oil which fills the cavities has ordinarily been derived from the subjacent rocks ; for the strata, in which the cavities exist, are frequently barren sandstones. The conditions required for the production of such subterranean accumulations would be therefore (as others have explained) a bituminous oil-bearing, or else oil-producing, stratum at a greater or less depth below; cavities to receive the oil ; an overlying stratum of clos\"e-grained shale or limestone, not allowing of the easy escape of the naphtha vapors. If the oil exists ready formed in the rocks, only a slight heat above that common to the rocks would be needed to expel the oil slowly from below. And, without heat, as Hunt states, the oil might be expelled through the pressure of superincumbent waters from the oil-bearing shales or clays, and would rise aud occupy the cavities because so light as to float on the waters. But if the oil-producing bed contained not the oil ready made, but only hydrocarbonaceous matters that may afford it on destructive distillation, the oil would have required considerable heat for its production. In the Caspian and Rangoon naphtha regions the oleiferous clayey deposits are nearly or quite superficial, and the oil, a viscid kind, exude3 readily into pits made for collecting it. In the United States liquid oil occurs in the Lower Silurian, in the \" Bird's-eye \" limestone of Riviere a la Rose (Montmorenci), Canada, and of Watertown, N. Y., in drops in fossil coral; and in the Trenton limestone at Pakenham, Canada, the cavities of large Orthocerata sometimes hold several ounces (T. S. Hunt, Am. J. Sci., II. xxxv. 166, 1S63); on Grand Manitoulin IA, where a spring affordiug it arises from the Utica shale, the source possibly the subjacent limestones; at Guilderland, near Albany, from the Hudson River group, as observed in a spring by Beck ; quite freely in limestone and shale near Chicago; far more so in Kentucky, in the Cumberland oil region, the wells, \"from which tens of thousands of barrels of oil have flowed\" (Newberry), descend 200 ft. into the Blue Limestone, in which there are bituminous shaly strata overlaid by sheets of thin-bedded compact limestone ; these features prevail from Lincoln and Casey Cos., through Adair and Russell, Cumberland and Clinton Cos., Ky., and Overton and Jackson Cos., Tenn. In the Upper Silurian traces have been observed in the Niagara limestone and the Medina red shales ; at Gaspe, Canada, in a Lower Helderberg limestone, on Silver Brook, etc ; near Chicago, so abundant in a limestone as to ooze out, and the rock may be made to burn, owing to its presence. In the Lower Devonian, the Corniferous limestone is regarded by Hunt as the source of the oil of Enniskillen, Canada, where there are large areas covered by the half-inspissated bitumen. Hunt states (1. c.) that at Rainham, Canada, on L. Erie, shells ot Pentamerus aratus are sometimes filled with petroleum; and that in other places in the region imbedded corals, Heliophyllum and Favosites, have, in certain of the layers, their cells full of oil (while in other layers it is absent from the corals), and in quarrying, the oil flows out and collects on the water of the quarry ; and at Gaspe, Lower Devonian sandstones afford oil springs and give rise to beds of thickened petro leum, and the chalcedonic geodes of a trap dyke, intersecting the sandstone, sometimes contain petroleum. In the Middle Devonian, the Black shale, or Genesee slate, is supposed by many geologists to be the piineipal source of the oil of Pennsylvania, the Kenawha valley, and othei parts of eastern Virginia, and of Ohio and Michigan; but J. P. Lesley atlributes much of the oil of western Pennsylvania to the Subcarboniferous. Near Fredonia, Chatauque Co., and at Rock ville, Alleghany Co., oil is found in connection with Chemung rocks, or the Upper Devonian (Hall). A little oil has been observed in connection with Triassic shales at Southbury, Conn. Tlie oil"], [781, "725 SIMPLE HYDEOCAEBONS. 0, soulhern California proceeds from Tertiary shales. On Trinidad a thick oil with asphalt, occurs in connection with lignite and other vegetable remains in the shales constituting the uppei part of the Tertiary ; and specimens of the vegetable material, partly changed to oil aud pene trated by it, and having its cells looking as if they had been corroded, as a result of the change, are described by Wall (Q.

Noted foreign localities are 3 m. from Ye-nan-gyoung (Fetid-water-rivulet), Burmah (and exporter from Rangoon), where there are about 100 wells, from 180 to 308 feet deep, each lined with hori zontal timber, but not all now worked (Oldham); the peninsula of Apcheron on the western shore of the Caspian, at Bakee, where naphtha exudes from argillaceous and calcareous beds, especially the former, of the Middle Tertiary (Abich), and where it has long been used for burn ing in lamps and for cooking; near the centro of the region the light anel pure naphtha oil is obtained, while along its borders the oil is a thicker petroleum, or passes iuto an asphalt, and solid masses of this asphalt are often seen floating in the Caspian; on the island of Tscheleken, near the eastern coast of the Caspian, in Balkan Bay ; on the banks of the Kuban, promontory of Taman, east side of isthmus betweeu the Azof and Black Sea; near the river Betchora, in the government of Archangel, Russia ; near the village of Amiano, in Parma, Italy, whence enough was formerly obtained to light the streets of Genoa ; at Zante, one of the Ionian islands (ancient Zacynthus), which has furnished oil for more than 2,000 years, its petroleum spring having been mentioned by Herodotus. Pliny mentious the oil of a spring at Agrigentum, Sicily, and states that it was collected and used for burning in lamps, as a substitute for oil. He distinguishes this oil from naphtha, which ho says was too light and inflammable for such a use. Of naphtha, he mentions a locality in \"Partlu'a\" (about the sources ofthe Indus). Oil is found also near the citv of Mexico, and on the river Lagun. The oil spring of Cuba, Alleghany Co., N. Y., called the Seneca Oil Spring, long known, was described by Prof. Silliman in 1833 (Am. J. Sci., xxiii. 97) as a dirty pool, about IS ft. across, covered with a film of oil, which was skimmed off from time to time for medicinal purposes. The so-called \"Seneca oil,\" sold at the time in the shops (and from which he often distilled naphtha for preserving potassium), ho observes was not from this spring (around which the Seneca Indians then had a reserve of a square mile), but, as he was told, from Oil Creek, Veuango Co., Pa., about 100 m. from Pittsburg. Seneca Lake has oil on its surface in some parts, and it is said to have given the name to the oil ; but whether this is the true source, or whether it came from its being collected and sold by the Seneca Indians, is not clear. Hildreth in 1833 (ib , xxiv. 63), and later in 1836 (ib., xxix. 86, 121, 129), gave an account of the salt wells of the Little Kenawha valley, which then afforded, he says, 50 to 100 gallons a year. He also speaks, iu 1833, of a well 475 ft. deep, 30 m. N. of Marietta, Ohio, which, when first opened, discharged at intervals of 2 to 4 days, for 3 to 6 hours each time, throwing out 30 to 60 gallons of oil at each \"eruption,\" but was then yielding only a barrel a week. In 1840 a spouting well of oil, at Burksville, Kentucky, was described (ib., xxxix. 195); the well was bored for salt, and 200 ft. down a \"fountaiu of pure oil was struck, which was thrown up more than 12 ft. above the surface of the earth,\" emitting, according to the estimate, 75 gallons a miuute; it \"continued to flow for several days succes sively,\" but then failed ; and efforts to bring it into action again, or find another, were not suc cessful. The petroleum of Enniskillen, Canada, was mentioned in 1844 by Mr. Murray, iu the Canada Geological Report for 1846 ; and iu 1S57 wells were sunk for the collection of it. In ls59, on Oil Creek, Venango Co., Pa., a boring for salt, but 75 feet deep, let out the first fountain of oil of that now famous oil-region. For many weeks it discharged 1,000 gallons per day. The origin of petroleum, including the lighter as well as heavier kinds, has been attributed by some to the decomposition of vegetable substances alone (Bisehof, etc.) ; but it is now gene rally admitted that it has come from animal as well as vegetable, as urged by Dufrenoy (Min., iv. 602, 1859), J. S. Nowberry (Ohio Agric. Rep.. 1859), and T. S. Hunt (.Can. Nat, vi. 241, 1861, Am. J. Sci.. II. xxxv., Ch. News, 1863). The conditions favorable to the formation of naphtha, as shown by the characteristics of the deposits in which it is found native, are tho following: (1) tho diffusion of organic material through a fine mud or clay; (2) the material in a very finely divided state; and (3), as a conse quence of the preceding, the atmosphere excluded as far as possible from the material undergoing decomposition. There is reason to believe that no more heat was required than what was afforded by the natural climate or temperature of the region and the process of fermentation. Shales, the most common oil-bearing rocks, were originally the fine mud of deep or shallow seas; and the limestones were tlie same, only the mud was calcareous in nature, like the corai mud of many a coral lagoon, as the author has elsewhere described after personal examination. These shales ordinarily contain few fossils of any kind, and very rarely distinct vegetable remains. It may be questioned whether tough fucoids (sea-weeds), or the branches and leaves of ordinary plants imbedded iu such clays, would ever become so subdivided or disorganized as to make the requisite emulsion with the mud free from any vegetable forms ; and it is more probable that the vegetable material present was either delicate water-plants, or was derived from abundiut infusorial or microscopic vegetable life. The limestones, ou the coutrary, are sometimes full of"], [782, "726 HYDEOCAEBON COMPOUNDS. fossils, but these are animal ; and, as the solid parts which make the fossils are to a large extent ground up to make the mud that becomes the limestone, the organic material these hard parts t on tain, as well as that of the fleshy parts and oils, would be diffused through the mud or earth in the very condition demanded. The light native oils do not occur in coal beds, which were made from thick beds of vegetable debris. In the above-mentioned circumstances, with the deposits under pressure from superincumbent beds, the atmospheric air almost totally excluded, the organic material might undergo decompo sition through the reactions of its own elements alone. (See on this subject, and the reactions mentioned below, Bisehof, Chem. G., ii. 1853, T. S. Hunt, Can. Nat. and Ch. News, 1. c.) The average composition of dry wood (the ash and nitrogen excluded) is represented by B. H0O1= Carbon 49-66, hydrogen 6-21, oxygen 44*13=100. Taking two parts, we have \u20ac12H1B\u00a9S. If now the oxygen combines with carbon to form carbonic acid, 4\u20ac0. will thus be removed, leaving 6B Hi u, which is the composition of one of the species of the naphtha group, the fifth, on p. 720. But tj6lllf, or B32'H.,2, its multiple by 4, corresponds also to 3(e0Hn)-t-\"C8H18 + 4(*enH2j,), the first two members light naphtha oils, and the last an ethylene, a composition much like that of Pennsylvania petroleum. The decomposition might not be as simple as here taken, as i to 1 p. c. of nitrogen is also present, and there would also be some animal material But the illustra tion is still satisfactory. That no water (H2 B) would be formed from the elements of the organic material is apparently indicated by the fact that this would make an excess of carbon or a defi ciency of ly-ilrogen. From Chevandier's numerous analyses (Ann. Ch. Phys., III. x. 129), the average composition of dry wood is carbon 51*21, hydrogen 6*24, oxygen 41-45, nitrogen 1-10, corresponding, if the nitrogen is not counted, to Bi2 H,,. 567.5; from which the resulting oils might be nearly the same as above. Were there less confinement by superincumbent beds or earthy material, part of the hydrogen might be lost by combining with the carbon and escape as marsh gas (*G H4), and thus determine the formation of the thicker oils; or else of the solid insoluble hydrocarbons, more orles3 oxyge nated, which make many shales a rich source of oil on distillation. With the air not well excluded, as in the case of all thick beds of vegetable debris, such as have formed peat and tho various kinds of coal, the decompositions would be more complex; out side oxygeu carrying off, it may be, part of the hydrogen (as water), and of the carbon (as carbonic acid). Thus B12 H18 \u20ac>8 (composition of wood) may change to B12 H14-s B-,, tho average compo sition otpeai; or to 612 H12 03.5=Carbon 67*92, hydrogen 5*66, oxygen 26*42 = 100, a medium brown coal (or lignite); or \u20ac12 H9.75 O0. n = Carbon 85*88, hydrogen 5-82, oxygen 8-30=100, Wigan cannel coal, etc. Marsh-gas (6H() is a common gas of marshy places and of Artesian wells, and so also, though less abundantly, carbonic acid (Bisehof). The distillation of wood will afford the solid hydrocar bons of the paraffin group ; Reichenbach, in his discovery of paraffin, obtaining it from the wood of the Fagus sylvatica. Dr. J. S. Newberry states (priv. contrib.) that off the shores of Lake Superior, at Marquette, he observed bubbles of gas coming from the bottom to the surface, which proved to be carburetted hydrogen ; and also, now and then, drops of oil slowly rising, and finally spreading over the surface, which oil proved on examination to be a kind of petroleum. Although the vegetable origin of the oil was not certain, it seemed to be altogether probable. On the island of Trinidad the oil-producing beds are clayey beds in the Tertiary, containing remains of plants, and Wall states (Q. J. G. Soc, xvi. 4b0) that there is full evidence that the liquid and solid bitu men was produced at the ordinary temperature and condition of climate in the occurrence of numerous specimens of the vegetable matter in process of transformation, which have, as a con sequence, the organic structure more or less obliterated. In the change of animal matters to oil, there is more nitrogen present to give complexity to the mutual reactions. But wheu the material is animal oils, there are only carbon, hydrogen, aDd oxygen, as in the case of vegetation. In such oil3 there are nearly the proportions -GisHsiOs. In the case of such a compound (oleic acid), the forming of carbonic acid from the oxygen would separate BB2, and leave Bn H3,, of the ethylene ratio; in that of B\u201e Hs4 B2 (margaric add) the same would leave B,t H34, or a combination of marsh-gas oils. Warren and Storer have obtained (Mem. Am. Ac. Boston, ix. 177. Am. J. Sci., II. xlii. 250) from the destructive distillation of a fish-oil, after its saponification by lime, all the compounds above enumerated of the Naphtha group, besides others of the ethylene and benzole series. Dr. Newberry has observed that cannel coal sometimes shows by its animal fossils that part of its oily products may be of animal origin (Am. J. Sci., II. xxiii. 212, 1857), instancing a case in Ohio in which the coal contained fossil fishes. He also remarks ou tho disagreeable smell of \u25a0jome limestone oil, and attributes it to its animal origin. Dufrenoy, in his Mineralogy (iv. 002, 1859), gives prominence to the fact that remains of fishes are common in oil-producing shales, and to the view that they are the source of the oil, mentioning as examples the black shales in the Coal formation at Saarbruck in Prussia, and Y'gornay near Autun in France ; the Permian (Zechstein) at Mansfeld ; grayish limestone, in the Lias\", at Doubs ; and grayish shale, in tho"], [783, "727 SIMPLE HYDEOCAEBONS. Middle Tertiary, at Menat, 30 m. from Clermont, France ; all of which abound in the remains of fishes. The shales adjoining the Albertite of Nova Scotia have been mentioned as another exam ple of this kind. The black semibituminous or coaly shales of the Triassic of the Connecticut valley contain numerous fossil fishes, aud these are the only fossils. Lesquereux derives petroleum (Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. Philad., xiii. 313) mainly from the decom position of fucoids and other marine plants, arguing for it on the ground of its occurrence so largely in rocks of marine origin. S. F. Peekham, in a recent communication to the author, sustains the idea that the light naphtha oils are solely of animal origin. It is to be noted that wherever marsh or water plants have grown in past time there must have been also a profusion of minute animal life to afford nitrogen and sulphur to the accumula ting debris; and, conversely, vegetable life of microscopic, if not also of larger kiuds, is present wherever there is animal life. The word naphtha is from the Persian nafata, signifying to exude ; and petroleum from nirpos, rock, and oleum, oil (the latter from the Greek i'Aaio>p, oil), dating only from tho middle ages (see Sm). Alt. \u2014 Petroleum undergoes alteration of condition in two ways : 1. Tite evaporation of its lighter oils. When exposed to the air the petroleum is free from pres sure, except the ordinary atmospheric, and open to the heat and winds of the region. As a con sequence the fighter naphtha oils pass off, leaving only the heavier, and the substance becomes gradually viscid, or even a solid consisting largely of solid hydrocarbons ; and the so-called asphalts, which may thus result, will be ordinary bitumens of one kind or another, or largely paraffin, according as paraffin is present or not in the native oil. In most oil regions, when the oil occurs at the surface open to the air, more or less of solid bitumen is to be found. Hunt speaks of the large \" gum-beds \" of half-dried bitumen in the oil region of Enniskillen ; and Winchell says that in the neighboring but less productive district in Michigan, masses of inspissated oil are common, and some are as hard as asphalt. At the naphtha island of Tschelekan there are large quantities of Neft-gil, as it is there called, which is nearly pure paraffin. The hot climate of the Caspian is favorable for such a result. 2. The oxydation of some or all of the ingredients constituting the petroleum. In the process of oxyda tion there is first a loss of some ofthe hydrogen by its union with oxygen to form water, which escapes. Thus the oils of the Marsh-gas series (6,H!n + ,) may pass to the less stable ethylenes (6QH2\u201e); or, by further loss of hydrogen, to species of the Benzole series (GaH2n_0), or of the Naphthalin series (6\u201e H2n-i2)- The last two appear to occur sparingly in nature. Secondly, there is oxygenation ; that is an absorption of, and union with, oxygen. Theso oxygenated substances have been yet but little investigated (see Asphaltum). They aro probably all solid at the ordi nary temperature. Hard bitumen or asphalt may hence consist either (1) of unoxygenated, or (2) partly of unoxy genated and partly oxygenated, tho usual fact ; or (3) solely of oxygenated hydrocarbons (very rarely, if ever, true in nature). The state of solidity is not proof that any part of the bitumen is oxygenated. SCHEERERITE GROUP. Wax-like, or bntter-like. General formula that of the Marsh-gas series, or Gn H2\u201e + 2. The two species here included are, according to the analyses (which need verification), polymeres of the first two species of the Marsh gas series, *G H0 and O, H\u201e.

Scheerer, in the year 1822, in the coal of a bed of brown coal in the Tertiary, at Uznach, near -St. Gallen, in Switzerland. The bed of coal is two to three feet thick, and the pine stems in it are almost unchanged. Among the species of pine there is the P. sylvesiris ; and the birches and firs are those of modern species. The age is the same with that of the peat beds of Redwitz. Besides scheererite it affords also fichtelite and konlite. On cryst., Kenng., Ber. Ak.

The species of this group are liquids like the naphtha oils, but are of higher specific gravity and atomic weight. They enter into the constitu tion of all free-flowing petroleum, but are especially characteristic of the denser kinds, and viscid bitumens, and exist largely also in many asphalts. They belong to the Ethylene series, and therefore have the general formula \u00a9nH3n*=(abke for all) Carbon 85-71, hydrogen 14-29. G.\u2014 0-75-0*84. The species ascertained to be native by'O. M.

Other higher native species of the above series have not yet been clearly defined. These compounds are made members of the Marsh-gas or Naphtha series by Pelouze and Cahours, who write the formulas as follows, and givo the annexed specific gravities, vapor densities, and boiling points : G.

Warren, by his superior methods, proves that the species obtained by them were not pure (I c.). Each ofthe four ethylene compounds above mentioned have been obtained from Rangoon tar, besides some species of the Naphtha group (at least B, H10 and *GeH18), traces of some of the Benzolo series, and also naphthalin. The name pittolium is from xirra, pitch, and oleum, oil, analogous to petroleum; andpillasphal turn, from the Greek for pilch and asphalt. \u2022 The word maltha is from the Greek /juADji, soft wax ; it was also used sometimes for a mixture of wax and pitch, employed for making the surface of writing-tablets, and for some kinds of cements. But Pliny (ii. 108) describes under this name an inflammable mud flowing from a pool at Samosata in North Syria on the Euphrates, wiiich he says (ii. 109) was similar in nature to naphtha ; and this use of the word has led to its later application to viscid bitumens. Petroleum in cavities in crystals. Davy, in his examinations of tho fluids in crystals (Phil. Trans., 1822, 367,, and postscript), found only water, except in the case of quartz from Dauphiny. The liquid in this case was about as viscid as linseed oil; brownish in color ; became solid and opaque at 13\u00b0 C. (56\u00b0 F.); had a smell resembling naphtha ; acted like a fixed oil when heated, the tem perature of ebullition being high ; and burned with flame, producing a whito smoke. The cavity was J in. across, but only a sixth of it was occupied by the fluid. Davy made his investigations ofthe fluids in crystals by having the crystals bored through to the cavity by a lapidary, and was the first to use this method. Peteolene. Boussingault obtained from the viscid bitumen and asphalt of Bechelbronn an oil which he called Petrolene, and announced it as the liquid ingredient of all asphalt, the solid one being named by him Asphaltene (see Asphaltum). It was separated by heating in an oil bath to a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. None of it passed over at a temperature below 100\u00b0 C. He obtained for its composition (Ann. Ch. Phys., lxi. 141, lxxiii. 442): Carbon 87-36 86*78 87*45 86*98 (J) 88-4. Hydrogen 1P90 12-20 12*30 12-70 12-5. Be writes for it the formula Bit> Hie, making it of the camphene series, B^ Hjn-i. It boiled at 280\u00b0 C. The vapor density is stated at 9*415, or \"double that of oil of turpentine.\" There can be no doubt that the petrolene was a mixture of oils. Warren states (priv. contrib.) that from Boussingault's data, as given in his article, the vapor density should have been 8*49 Instead of 9*415 ; and also that his own researches on various hydrocarbon oils, including the products from the destructive distillation of albertite, lead him to believe that petrolene probablt"], [786, "730 HYDEOCAEBON COMPOUNDS consists mainly of oils of the Ethylene series ; that \u00a9is As. would have for its boiling point 29b' C, and vapor density 7-745 ; but that the liquid is made up of oils of both less and greater density. The Bechelbronn tar and that similar from Lobsann (both in the Dept. of Bas-Rhin, France) are called also Mineral Graisse and Graisse de Strasbourg. Volckel has subjected a viscid bitumen from Travers, near NeufcbateL to distillation in iron cylinders (Ann. Ch. Pharm., lxxxvii. 143, 1862), and obtained the foUowing as his successive results : C H Temp, of vaporization.

But (aa Warren observes) with such a mode of distillation artificial products were likely to have been obtained, and among them benzole or naphthalin ; and the presence of either of these compounds would account for the divergence from the ethylene series. The composition is compared by Volckel to that of oil of amber (an admitted product of distiUa tion, and not native to amber). Dbpping obtained for the oil of amber passing over at 200\u00b0 C, C S7-48, 87-32, H 12-06, 11-98=99-54, 99'30. The ratio for 8, A is 5 : 8! which is also that for amber itself; and the formula is 810 Hie, or that arrived at by Boussingault for his petrolene. Solid Petrolene. The asphalt of Peklenicza (Murakoz), Austria, affords a solid portion, solu ble iu ether and hardly at aU so in alcohol (in this respect Uke the asphaltene of Boussingault), which, according to Nendtvich (Haid. Ber., iii. 271, Jahrb. G. Reichs., vii. 743), has the samt composition with petrolene. The observations thus far made seem to point to a Camphene series of Hydrocarbons as char acteristic of many viscid bitumens, and of some, if not many, asphalts. But the investigations have not been sufficiently exact to sustain satisfactorily the conclusion. PARAFFIN GROUP. Wax-like in consistence ; white and translucent. Sparingly soluble in alcohol, rather easily in ether, and crystallizing more or less perfectly from the solutions. G. about 0*85\u20140*98. Melting point for the following species, 33\u00b0-90\u00b0. General formula On H\u201en, or that of the ethylene series, according to many authors, = Carbon 85*71, hydrogen 24*29 = 100; *0n H2n + 2, according to others. The peculiar inertness of the paraffins with regard to chemical combination is urged by Watts and Frankland as favoring the latter formula. Whichever the series, they are regarded as species of high atomic weight, n not being less than 28. The different species, varying in the value of m\\ vary also in boiling point, and other characters. Those here recognized have not been studied with that care which is demanded for full confidence in their stated composition, or in their purity as simple species. Paraffins occur in the Pennsylvania petroleum, a freezing mixture redu cing the temperature being sufficient to separate it in crystals. Also in the naphtha of the Caspian, in Rangoon tar, and many other liquid bitu mens.

Obs. \u2014 Constitutes about four-fifths of the Urpeth Colliery ozocerite, and is separated from the latter through its solubility in cold ether. The crude wax, as found, was soft enough to be kneaded in the fingers ; had a greasy feel, and gave a greasy stain to paper ; was subtransparent ; of a brownish-yellow color by transmitted light, but yellowish-green and opalescent by reflected ; and had an odor slightly fatty, which was stronger when melted. It occurred in cavities near a fault in the coal measures, and part in the solid sandstone. Laurent obtained a variety of paraffin by the dry distillation of the bituminous shale of Autun, which melted at 33\u00b0 C, was very soluble in ether and insoluble in alcohol, and which consisted of Carbon 85-745, hydrogen 14*200=99*945. It may be identical with the above. It is quite probable that the urpethite obtained by Johnston was not free from mixture with tho second paraffin separated by him from the Urpeth mineral by means of boiling ether, which is here referred to ozocerite (p. 732) ; and such a mixture might account for the divergence of the melting point from that of Laurent's paraffin. Taking 33\u00b0 C. as the true melting point, the several paraffins here described, urpethite, hatchettite, ozocerite, Johnston's third from the Urpeth wax, and zietri sikite, have nearly a common difference in melting points of 13\u00b0 \u2014 17\u00b0, the temperatures being respectively 33\u00b0, 46\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 73\u00b0 90\u00b0. The mean difference is about 14\u00b0 ; this would make the melting points 33\u00b0, 47\u00b0, 61\u00b0, 75\u00b0, 89\u00b0. 779. HATCHETTITE. Hatchetine (fr. Merthyr-Tydvil) Conybeare, Ann.

Conybeare (1. c, 1822) stated that the Merthyr-Tydvil hatchettite \" melts in warm water under 170\u00b0 F., whereas true bitumen does not in boiliug water ; \" and this loose remark is the only ground for the statement that 76*6\u00b0 C. is the melting point of one variety of the mineral.

The mineral wax of Urpeth Colliery, after the separation of what was soluble in cold ether (see Ukpethite, p. 7 3 1 ), afforded Johnston (1 c. ) another portion through its solubility in boiling ether ; and this is apparently identical with true ozocerite. While soluble in boiling ether it is sparingly so in boiling alcohol. As obtained from the ether solution it was yellow, and had the consistence of soft wax. A kind from Boryslaw in Galicia, examined by Hofstadter (Ann. Ch. Pharm., xei. 326, 1854), resembled the preceding in its appearance, but was darker colored, being blackish-brown ; in thin pieces reddish-brown to leek-green by transmitted light; G.=0*944; melting point 60\u00b0. By fractional crystallization it was separated into parts varying in fusibility from 60\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 5' C. That from Truscawitz, Galicia, examined by Walter (J. pr.

The above results agree closely, and probably the ozocerite in the specimens examined was but little impure from mixture with other paraffins. Hermann has described a wax-like mixture from seams in a rock in the vicinity of Lake Baika1 which he calls Baikerite (J. pr. Ch., lxxiii. 230). About 60*18 p. c. of it was soluble in boiling alcohol, 100 parts dissolving 1 ; and this portion appears to be ozocerite. It was tasteless and inodorous ; melting point 09\u00b0 C. ; G.=0*90. The rest (29-82 p. c.) of the baikerite consisted as follows: 7*02 wax-like substance insoluble in alcohol; 32*41 viscid resin ; 0*39 earthy impuri ties. The same compound has been obtained from mineral coal peat, and petroleum, mineral tar, etc., by destructive distillation. The following are examples : 1, Anderson (Rep. Brit. Assoc, 1856, J. pr.

Comp., Var., etc. \u2014 The almost complete insolubility of this fossil wax in ether distinguishes it decisively from ozocerite. \u00bb 1. Magnus, who made the first examination of the fossil wax brought by v. Meyer from Slanik. Moldavia, appears to have had a different substance in hand from that examined by Glocker (by whom ozocerite was named) and by Schrotter, as he stales that only a very little of it was dissolved by alcohol or ether, and the rest, after the action of these solvents, was eroded with holes, show ing the presence of insoluble and soluble constituents. The insoluble was soluble in oil of tur pentine, and of this part the melting point was 82\u00b0, aud the composition as given below. 2. The wax from Zietrisika, Moldavia, examined by Malaguti, is regarded by him as identical with that of Magnus. It was foliated, conchoidal in fracture, pearly in lustre, deep red-brown in color with a greenish reflection, but in very thin pieces brown, and a little harder than beeswax. It was very slightly soluble in alcohol or boiling ether, and very soluble in oil of turpentine and naphtha, with no action from alkalies or cold sulphuric acid. It melts at 84\u00b0 C, and boils at above 300\u00b0. On subjecting it to boiling alcohol, a small portion was dissolved, whose melting point was 75\u00b0 ; by a second treatment another portion was obtained, having for the melting point 78\u00b0 ; and at the fourth, the portion dissolved was found to have the same melting point as that of the undissolved mass, which was 90\u00b0. This then, which he calls brown ozocerite, appears to be the point of fusion of the true zietrisikite, and this alone was analyzed ; as the rest, his yellow ozocerite, ho says, \" est un melange, j'ai juge inutile d'en faire l'analyse.\" Analyses: 1, Magnus (1. a); 2, 3, Malaguti (1. c): C H Melting T.

Hermann found 66 p. c. of a wax-like substance insoluble in alcohol, and 18 p. c. of another soluble in alcohol, besides 13*33 p. c. of a resin. In ether a large part was insoluble; and this portion may be identical with the zietrisikite, or the insoluble paraffin from the Urpeth wax (p. 731). 781C. Pveopissite Eenng., Ueb. 1850-51, 148. Kenngott has thus named an earthy, friable, coaly substance, of grayish-brown color, and without lustre, and having G. = 0*493\u2014 0*522, which forms a layer 6 to 9 in. thick in brown coal at Weissenfels, near Halle. It is a mixture of species instead of a mineral, aud has not yet been properly investigated. A small part is soluble in alcohol, especially in boiling, and this, precipitated by adding water, is a wax-like substance, paraffin-like in aspect. But whether true paraffin, or whether an oxygenated wax, related to geocerite (a specie,\", derived from a similar earthy brown coal from Gersterwitz, near Weissenfels), has not been ascertained. It melts easily to a pitch-like mass, and hence the name, from Tip, fire, and jnVprpi, pitch. It affords 62 p. c. of paraffin on dry distiUation. On the composition of the related Gersterwitz earthy coal, see pp. 757, 758; also, C. Karsten, ZS. G., ii. 71. And for other papers on a similar material from Helbra, between Mansfeld and Eisleben, see Voigt, Brennbarer Fossil fr. Helbra, Vers. Gesch. Steiukohle, etc, 188, 1802, J. d. M., xv. 77, 1804 ; G. Heine, id., Jahrb. Min. 1845, 149. Such coals are sometimes called Paraffin coal, and in German Wachskohle. Kenngott refers here also au earthy brown substance from Mettenheira, which melts similarly to an asphalt-like substance ; no other evidence of identity is stated. It occurs incrusting massive limestone. 782. ELATERITE. Subterraneau Fungus (fr. Derbyshire) Lister, Phil. Trans., 1673. Elastic Bitumeu. Mineral Caoutchouc.

The mineral occurs in the form of shining scales, flat crystals, and thin layers between tie rings of growth and throughout the texture of pine wood (identical in species with the modern Pinus sylvestris) from peat beds in the vicinity of Redwitz, in the Fichtelgebirge, North Bavaria The crystals described by Clark (f. 616) were obtained artificially by means of ether and alcohol An oily substance was extracted by Schrotter by means of ether from wood of the same peat bed which afforded the fichtelite ; and this solution yielded two substances, one of which was an oil, regarded by him as identical with fichtelite in ratio; it gave on analysis, Carbon 88*58, hydrogen 11-34=99-42. The other substance was crystallized aud contained oxygen. Tecoretin was obtained from pine trees of the same species in marshes near Holtegard in Den mark. The resin from the wood, first observed by Steenstrup, was found by Forchhammer, after dissolving it in boiling alcohol to contain two substances crystallizing from the solution at differ ent temperatures. The tecoretin was the least soluble of tho two, or that which crystallized out first (the other was his phylloretin, see p. 737) ; its crystallization was monoclinic, and its fusing point 45'.

It occurs among the layers or tissues of the wood, and also in clefts in the coal or lignite. Branchite is colorless and translucent, with G. = 1-0442, and comes from the brown coal of Mt.

According to Berzelius (Lehrb., viii. 431, Pogg., xii. 419), it consists mainly (85 to 90 p. c.) of a resin which resists all solvents (properly the species succinite), along with two other resins soluble in alcohol and ether, an oil, and 2-J to 6 p. c. of succinic acid. Schrotter and Forchhammer state that after removing these soluble ingredients, true succinite has the ratio 40 : 32 : 4, which is the ratio deduced from the analyses of the whole mass, and which indicates that the mixed resins are polymerous with succinite. Their nature has not beeu investigated. Amber is hardly acted on by alcohol. Burns readily with a yellow flame, emitting an agreeable odor, and leaves a black, shining, car bonaceous residue. Obs Amber occurs abundantly on the Prussian coast of the Baltic ; occurring from Dantzig to Memel, especially between Pillau and Dorse Gross-Hubnicken. It occurs also on the coast of Denmark and Sweden; in Galicia, near Lemberg, and at Miszau; in Poland; in Moravia, at Boskowitz, etc. ; in the Urals, Russia ; near Christiania, Norway ; in Switzerland, near Bile ; in France, near Paris, in clay, in the department of the Lower Alps, with bituminous coal, also in the department of l'Aisne, de la Loire, du Gard, du Bas-Rhin. In England, near London, and on the coast of Norfolk, Essex, and Suffolk. It also occurs in various parts of Asia. Also near Catania, on the Sicilian coast, sometimes of a peculiar blue tinge. It has been found in various parts of the Green sand formation of the United States, either loosely imbedded in the soil, or engaged in marl or lignite, as at Gay Head or Martha's Yine yard, near Trenton and also at Camden in New Jersey, and at Cape Sable, near Magothy river in Maryland. In the royal museum at Berlin there is a mass weighing 18 lbs. Another in the kingdom of Ava, India, is nearly as large as a child's head, and weighs 24 lbs. ; it is intersected by veiiis of carbonate of lime, from the thickness of paper to one-twentieth o( au inch. It is now fully ascertained that amber is a vegetable resin altered by fossilization. This ia inferred both from its native situation with coal, or fossil wood, and from the occurrence of insects incased in it. Of these insects, some appear evidently to have struggled after being entangled in tbe then viscous fluid; and occasionally a leg or wing is found some distance from the body, which had been detached in the effort to escape. Goppert has shown (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1853, 450, Q. J. G. Soc, x., Am. J. Sci., II. xviii. 287) that at least 8 species of plants besides the Piniles succinifer have afforded this fossilized resin, and he enumerates 163 species as represented by remains in amber. Besides pines, species of the family Abietine\u00e6 and Cupressine\u00e6 have prob ably contributed to it. Amber was early known to the ancients, and called j7,Wr0pji., electrum, whence, on account ol its electrical susceptibilities, we have derived the word electricity. It was named by some lyncu rium, though this uame was applied by Theophrastus also to a stone, probably to zircon or tour maline, both minerals of remarkable electrical properties. Pliny mentions, as one proposed derivation of electrum, the fable, as he regards it, that the sisters of Phaethon, changed into poplars, shed their tears on the banks of the Eridanus (oi Padus), and that these tears were called electrum, from the fact that the sun was usually called elector ; as another, that it comes from Eiectrides, the name of certain islands in the Adriatic; or another eiectrides, the name of certain stones in Britannia, from which it exudes. He gives it aa his opinion that \"amber is an exudatiuii from trees of the pine family, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine ; \" and, as proof that it was once liquid, alludes to the gnats, etc., in it. He observes that it had been long called succinum, because of this origin, \"quod arboris succuni prisci nostri credidere.\" He says that in his time it was \" in request among \u25a0\u25a0vomeu only.\" But \"it had been so highly valued as an object of luxury that a very diminutive"], [797, "741 OXYGENATED HYDEOCAEBONS. human effigy, made of amber, had been known to sell at a higher price than living men, e*r?n in stout and vigorous health.\" 799A.

The oxygen includes a little nitrogen and sulphur. Williams makes the formula C30, H 6o 03 *= Carbon 78*60, hydrogen 10*92, oxygen 10*48, agreeing hardly as well with the analyses as the above. Does not melt when heated. In a platinum crucible affords a fatty odor, and burns with a dense smoky flame. No action with moderately dilute nitric acid ; completely carbonized by con centrated sulphuric acid. Obs. \u2014 Bathvillite occurs in the torbanite or Boghead coal (of the Carboniferous formation), adjoining the lands of Torbanehill, in the grounds of Bathville, Scotland. It form3 lumps which fill cavities in tho torbanite. Other cavities are occupied by calcite, pyrite, etc. It may be an altered lump of resin ; or else material which has filtrated into the cavity from the surroundiug torbanite. The analysis of Miller shows that some of the torbanite has the same composition. As proof of the absolute purity of the substances analyzed could not be had, the results are open to somi doubt, as Williams observes. Yet the mode of occurrence of the bathvillite, and the nearness in composition of this insoluble substance to the equally insoluble succinite, favors the view that it is essentially a good species, and that its composition is not far from that above given. 804. Torbanite. Torbanite, although related to cannel coal, has a very nearly uniform com position, according to all analyses thus far made, excepting that of Miller, and this composition ia like that of bathvillite, excepting less oxygen. It corresponds very nearly with the formula Co HB802p2s=Carbon 82-19, hydrogen 11*64, oxygen 6*17. The mean of five analyses (seep. 757) is, Carbon 81*15, hydrogen 11-48, with oxygen about 6-0, nitrogen 1-37 = 100 ; excluding the nitro gen, C 82*28, H 11*54, O 6-08 = 100. Taking the oxygen at 5-40 instead of 6-0 (see anal, 1 c.\\ the formula would become 01OH68 0>. The nitrogeu is without doubt in combination with por tions of the other ingredients. But, allowing for this, the close relation to the amber group still holds, both as regards composition and insolubility. Less than 14 p. c. of torbanite is soluble in naphtha (Fyfe). Although the above formula cannot be taken as the formula of the species at the basis torbanite, it is probably not far from it. Torbanite may contain bathvillite as mixture 805. XYLORETINITE.

The material of the layer is of loam-like aspect, but gives a shining wax-like streak, has G.=l*297, Wackenroder, and loses 22 p. c. of water at 100\u00b0 C. The dried mass is nearly half sand and other earthy materials. The leucopetrite is associated in the coaly layer, according to Briickner, with other organic compounds, soluble in alcohol of 80 p. c, including two resins, two wax-like substances (p. 738), and an acid which Briickner calls Georelinic acid (p. 748). By a distillation of the mass of the brown coal, 28 p. c. of the whole passes over as a butter-like mass, which is related to the paraffins, but, according to Bruckner, contains 2 p. c. of oxygen. It afforded (f) Carbon 84*04, hydrogen 14*10, oxygen [1*86], and he writes the formula 056H11O0. It is soluble easily in hot absolute alcohol and ether, and very sparingly in alcohol of 80 p. c. ; crystals in pearly hexagonal plates from the alcoholic solution ; melts at 50\u00b0 C.

It is brittle ; of brownish-black color ; greasy-resinous lustre ; wood-brown powder; H.=2*5; G. = 105\u2014 1*18; and resembles much brown coal. It burns with a reddish-yellow flame, and a strong odor like that of burning amber, and leaves a black coal. It melts easily, decomposing and giving off white fumes, and leaves an asphalt-like mass. Reuss states evidence showing that it has probably been formed by the action of the heat of a basaltic dike on a bed of brown coal. 810. Reussisite. Part of Pyroretin of A. E. Reuss. Resin-like.

A caking bituminous coal from New Zealand, analyzed by C.

The existence of a sulphur-bearing resin like the above from Tasmania renders it probable that the New Zealand coal is impregnated with a similar insoluble resin ; 2\"37 p. c. of sulphur would correspond to the presence of about 44 p. c. of such a resin.

The insoluble portion has not been investigated. Hatchett found (1. c.) vegetable resin 55, bitumen 41 (the iusoluble part, which he regarded as asphalt, and alludes to in the name retinasphalt), and earthy matter 3 = 99. A retinitefrom Halle afforded Bucholz (Schweig. J., i. 290, 1811) 91 parts soluble in absolute alcohol, and 9 parts insoluble. The former gives a yellowish-brown deposit on dilutiou, and is more soluble in boiling dilute alcohol than in cold; and it is insoluble in pure ether and turpen tine. The latter is also insoluble in ether. Both are soluble in alkalies, which would seem tu indicate that they are acid in their relations. The resin fuses with more difficulty than most resins, blackens in the heat, and gives out a strong aromatic odor. By distillation yields a brown thick oil, some water containing a little acetic acid, besides carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen. 826. DOPPLERITE. Dopplerit Haid., Ber. Ak.

Named after Bergrath Doppler, who was the first to bring the substance to notice. C. W. Giimbel has referred here (Jahrb. Min. 1858, 278) a substance from a peat-bed uear Berchtesgaden. It is soft, plastic, elastic, black, of waxy lustre, tasteless ; on drying in the air it resembles compact coal, is brittle and velvet-black, and has H. = 2*5, G. = l*439, lustre vitreous, with powder brownish-black. The air-dried material loses, at 80\u00b0 CL, 12 p. c. of water. Unlike dopplerite, it burns with a bright yellow flame, is partially soluble in alcohol, and the akoholic solution affords a resin (Kenng. Ueb., 1858, 142). A pitch-black coal-like substance from the peat-beds at Kolbenmoor, near Berchtesgaden, the same that are described by Giimbel, related to dopplerite in composition, and in not burning with a flame when inserted in fragments in the flame of a candle, has been analyzed by C.

ASPHALTUM. ' 'Amba\\Tos Aristot, Strabo, Diosc, etc. Bitumen Plin., xxxv. 51. Asphalt, Mineral Pitch. Asphalt, Bergpech, Erdpech, Germ. Asphalte, Bitume, Fr. [For syn. of Pittasphalt or Mineral Tar (Bergtheer Germ.), see p. 128.] Asphaltum, or mineral pitch, is a mixture of different hydrocarbons, part of which are oxygenated. Its ordinary characters are as follows : Amorphous. G. = 1 \u2014 1*8; sometimes higher from impurities. Lustre like that of black pitch. Color brownish-black and black. Odor bitumi nous. Melts ordinarily at 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 O, and burns with a bright flame. Soluble mostly or wholly in oil of turpentine, and partly or wholly in ether ; commonly partly in alcohol. Tlie more solid kinds graduate into the pittasphalts or mineral tar (p. 728), and through these there is a gradation to petroleum. The fluid kinds change into the solid by the loss of a vaporizable portion on exposure, and also by a process of oxydation, which consists first in a loss of hydrogen, and finally in the oxygenation of a portion of the mass. Comp. \u2014 The action of heat, alcohol, ether, naphtha, and oil of turpentine, as well as direct analyses, show that the so-called asphaltum from different localities is very various in composi tion. Yet the true composition is not known of any one of them. It has been shown only that the following are the classes of ingredients present: A Oils vaporizable at about 100\u00b0 G, or below; sparingly present, if at all. B. Heavy oils, probably of the Pittolium or Petrolene groups (pp. 728, 129); vaporizable between 100\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 C. ; constituting sometimes So p. c. of the mass. C. Resins soluble in alcohol. D. Solid asphalt-like substance or substances soluble in ether and not in alcohol; black, pitch-like, lustrous in fracture; 15 to 85 p. c. E. Black or brownish-black substance or substances not soluble either in alcohol or ether ; similar to D in color and appearance, Kersten ; brown and ulmin-like, \"Volckel ; 1 to 75 p. c. F. Nitrogenous substances ; often as much as correspouds to 1 or 2 p. c. of nitrogen. Boussingault attempted an investigation of tho composition in 1837 (Ann. Ch. Phys., lxxiv. 141), and arrived at the conclusion that there were two principles present; one petrolene. an oil, tho other asphaltene, a solid, and concluded that all asphalts were mixtures of these two iu different proportions. But his petrolene, as already observed, is beyond question a mixture of oils ; and his asphaltene needs much more investigation. His special examinations on this pomt were made only on the asphalt of Bechclbronn. Ho found in it (1) no light oil (or A), as nothing was given off at 100\u00b0 C. ; (2) 85-4 p. c. of heavier oil, or his petrolene, vaporized between 100\u00b0 and 236\u00b0 C. (B); and (3) 14-6 p. c. of a black, lustrous, asphalt-like solid, his asphaltene, soluble in ether, oil of turpentine, and fatty oils, but not in alcohol (D). Asphaltene was the solid sub stance after subjecting the asphaltum to a temperature of 250\u00b0 C. in a hot oil-bath. (Boussingault has been quoted by Berzelius, Kersten, Rammelsberg, and others, as making the asphaltene not soluble in ether, but he expressly mentions its solubility. He also states earlier that the mass of the asphalt was wholly soluble in ether ; and, also, that he used ether to separate it from the impurities present, after which kind of purification it burnt without residue) Boussingault's analysis of asphaltene afforded : Carbon 150 Hydrogen fl-9 Oxygen 14-8=99-1; giving the ratio for 0, H, 0=40 : 64 : 6. He closes tho paper with his analysis of an asphalt (the mass) from Caxitambo, as follows : C75-0 H9*5 0 15*5=100; and remarks on the near approach of this alphalt in composition to asphaltene. But in 1S40 (1 c, Ixxiii. 444) he gives two new analyses of the Caxitambo asphalt, in which he obtained only 1*05 of oxygen and nitrogen (see anal 7, below); and adds that \"his earlier analysis was mads"], [808, "752 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. by the method ordinarily followed at that time, by which method he was never at b o obtaii more than 76 p. c. of carhon.\" The remark virtually concedes the inaccuracy of the analysis also of asphaltene, or at least gives sufficient occasion for a very large doubt. No special mention is made in this second paper of the asphalt of Bechelbronn, but analyses are given of petrolene from the locality. Nendtvich, in an investigation of an asphalt from Peklenicza, Austria, found it to consist almost solely of asphaltene, that is, it was soluble in ether and not in alcohol; and in 1843 (Jahrb. G. Reichs., vii. 74:-;) obtained for it nearly the composition of asphaltene (or C 72-45, H 11-07 0 16'4S); but in 1847 (Haid. Ber., iii. 271) he rejects his earlier results, and states that the mineral contained no oxygen, and was essentiaUy identical in composition with petrolene, as stated cn p. 730. Other analysts have not afforded more satisfactory results. Part have been contented with analyses of the undivided mass ; while others have ascertained the portions soluble in different menstrua, without ascertaining the constituents of the substances obtained. The following table contains the proportions of the ingredients A, B, C, D, E, above, m a few asphalts. The letters E and A, in connection with the statement of the solubility, stand for ether and alcohol. 1, Boussingault (1. a); 2, Kersten (J. pr. Ch., xxxv. 271) ; 3, 4, Volckel (Ann. Ch.

But these are generally, if not always, connected with rock deposits containing some kind of bituminous material or vegetable remains (see p. 725). Some of the noted localities of asphaltum are the region of the Dead Sea, or Lake Asphaltites, whence the most of the asphaltum of ancient writers : a lake on Trinidad, 14 m. in circuit, wlijh is hot at the centre, but is solid and cold toward the shores, and has it3 borders over a breadth of f m. covered with the hardened pitch with trees flourishing over it ; aud about Point La Braye, the masses of pitch look Uke black rocks among the foliage ; at various places in S America, similar lakes, as at Caxitambo (not Coxitambo), Peru, which is used at Payta, on thi coast (under the equator), for pitching boats, etc. ; at Berengela, Peru, not far from Arica (S.), where it is put to the same use ; in California, near the coast of St. Barbara, an area of somt acres; in a large bed, near Avlona in Albania (G. = l-205). Also in smaller quantities, sometimei disseminated through shale and sandstone rocks, and occasionally limestones, or collected in cavities or seams in these rocks \u2022 near Matlock Derbyshire, in stalactitic masses ; Poldice mine"], [809, "MINERAL COAL. 753 in Cornwall; Haughmond Hill in Shropshire; at Bastennes aud Dax, Dept. of Landes, constitu ting 6 p. c. of a sandy deposit; Val do Travers, Neuchatel, impregnating a bed in the Cretaceous formation, and serving as a cement to the rock, which is used for buildings; impregnating dolomite on the island of Brazza in Dalmatia ; in the Caucasus ; in gneiss and mica schist in Sweden. The following substances are closely related to asphaltum, and, like it, are mixtures of undeter mined carbobydrogens. 830A. Grahamite Wurtz (Coal or Asphalt Lesley, Proc. Am. Phil Soc.

Soluble mostly in oil of turpentine ; partly in ether, naphtha, or benzole ; not at all in alcohol ; wholly in chloroform and sulphid of carbon. No action with alkalies or hot nitric or muriatic acid. Melts only imperfectly, and with a decomposition of the surface ; but in this state the interior may be drawn into long threads. Occurs in W. Virginia, about 20 m. in an air line S. of Parkersburg, filling a fissure (shrinkage fissure) in a sandstone of the Carboniferous formation ; and supposed to be, like the albertite, an inspissated and oxygenated petroleum. There is yet no reliable analysis of it, not even an ultimate analysis. The material is partly columnar from a fracturing as a result of contraction ill the material, the structure being vertical to the sides of tho vein. 830B Albeetite Robb. (Melan- Asphalt Wetherill, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. Philad., 1852, 353.) Differs from ordinary asphaltum in being only partially soluble in oil of turpentine, and iu its very imperfect fusion when heated. It has H. = l \u2014 2; G. = l*097 ; lustre brilliant, pitch-like; color jet-black. Softens a little in boiling water ; iu the flame of a candle shows incipient fusion. According to imperfect determinations, only a trace soluble iu alcohol; 4 p. c. in ether; 30 in oil of turpentine. Wetherill obtained in an ultimate analysis (1 c.) Carbon 86*04, hydrogen 8-9fi, oxygen 1'97, nitrogen 2-93, S tr., ash 0*10 = 100. By destructive distillation, oils of the Naphtha, Betanaph tha, and Ethylene series have been obtained by Warren. Occurs filling an irregular fissure in rocks of the Subcarboniferous age (or Lower Carboniferous) in Nova Scotia, aud is regarded as an inspissated and oxygenated petroleum. For an article on its mode of occurrence, see Hitchcock, Am. J. Sci., II. xxxix. 267. 830C. Piauzite (Retinit von Piauze, Piauzit, Haid., Pogg., lxii. 275, 1844). An asphalt-like substance, remarkable for its high melting-point, 315\u00b0 C. It occurs slaty massive; color brownish or greenish-black; thin splinters colophonite-brown by transmitted light; streak light brown, amber-brown; ll. = l*5; G. = 1'220; 1*186, Kenngott. After melting, it burns with an aromatic odor and much smoke, leaving 5*96 per cent, of ash. Soluble in ether and caustic potash, also largely in absolute alcohol. Heated in a glass tube a yellowish oily fluid is distilled, having an acid reaction. It comes from a bed of brown coal at Piauze, near Neustadt in Carniola ; on Mt. Chum, neai Tiiffer in Styria, where thousands of pounds have been obtained. It much resembles a black lamellar coal (Kenngott, Jahrb. G. Reichs., 91, 1856). 830D. Beren-gelite Johnston, Phil Mag., III. xiii. 329, 1838. Asphaltum -like. Color dark brown, with a tinge of green. Powder yellow. Lustre of surface of fracture resinous. Analysis: Johnston (1. c.) : 0 72*47, H 9*20, O 18*33 = 100, corresponding to the ratio for0, H, 0, 40 : 62 : 8. Forms a solution with cold alcohol, which is bitter to the taste. On evaporation the resin obtained has a clear red color, and remains soft and viscid at the ordinary temperature. Nearly insoluble in caustic potash. Odor resinous, disagreeable ; but after fusion for some time at 100' ft, this odor is succeeded by an agreeable one ; on cooling it regains the original odor. It is said to form a lake liko that of Trinidad, iu the province of St. Juan de Berengela, about 100 m. from Arica, Peru, aud is used at Arica for paying boats and vessels. 831. MINERAL COAL.

Mineral coal is made up of different kinds of hydrocarbons, with perhaps in some cases free carbon ; but the species have not yet been investigated. The distinguishing characters of mineral coal are as follows : Compact massive, without crystalline structure or cleavage ; sometimes breaking with a degree of regularity, but from a jointed rather than a cleavage structure. Sometimes laminated ; often faintly and delicately banded, successive layers differing slightly in lustre. H.=0-5\u2014 2*5. G. \u2014 1 \u2014 1*80. Lustre dull to brilliant, and either earthy, resinous, or submetallic. Color black, grayish-black, brownish-black, and occasionally iridescent ; also sometimes dark brown. Opaque. Fracture conchoidal \u2014 uneven. Brittle ; rarely somewhat sectile. Without taste, except from impurities present. Insoluble in alcohol, ether, naphtha, and benzole, excepting at the most 2 or 3 p. c. (rarely 10 ?) ; usually less than 1 p. c. Insoluble in a solution of potash. Infusible to subfusible ; but often becoming a soft, pliant, or paste-like mass when heated. On distil lation most kinds afford more or less of oily and tarry substances, which are mixtures of hydrocarbons and paraffin. Var. \u2014 The variations depend partly (1) on the amount of the volatile ingredients afforded ot destructive distillation ; or (2 ) on the nature of these volatile compounds, for ingredients of similai composition may differ widely in volatility, etc. ; (3) on structure, lustre, and other physical characters. 1. Anthracite (Anthracit Karst, Tab., 58, 96, 1808. Glanzkohle Germ.). H.=2\u2014 2*5. G.= 1*32 \u2014 1-7, Pennsylvania; 1-81, Rhode Island; P26 \u2014 P36, South Wales. Lustre bright, often submetallic, iron-black, and frequently iridescent. Fracture conchoidal. Volatile matter after drying 3 to 6 p. c. Burns with a feeble flame of a pale color. The anthracites of Pennsylvania contain ordinarily 85 to 93 per cent, of carbon ; those of South Wales, 88 to 95 ; of France, 80 to 83 ; of Saxony, 81 ; of southern Russia, sometimes 94 per cent. Anthracite graduates into bituminous coal, becoming less hard and containing more volatile matter ; and an intermediate variety is called free-burning anthracite. 2. Native Coke. More compact than artificial coke, and some varieties afford considerable bitu men. From the Edgehill mines, near Richmond, Va., according to Genth, who attributes its ori gin to the action of a trap eruption on bituminous coal Bitdiiino-ds Coals (Schwarzkohle Hausm., Handb., 73, 1813. Steinkohle pt. Germ.). Under the head of Bituminous Coals, a number of kinds are included which differ strikingly in the action of heat, and which therefore are of unlike constitution. They have the common characteristic of burning in the fire with a yellow, smoky flame, and giving out on distillation hydrocarbon oils or tar, and hence the name bituminous. The ordinary bituminous coals contain from 5 to 15 p. c. (rarely 16 or 17) of oxygen (ash excluded); while the so-called brown coal or lignite con tains from 20 to 36 p. c, after the expulsion, at 100\u00b0 C, of 15 to 36 p. c. of water. The amount of hydrogen in each is from 4 to 7 p. c. Both have usually a bright, pitchy, greasy lustre (whence often called Pechkohle in German), a firm compact texture, are rather fragile compared with anthracite, and have G. = 114\u2014 1-40. The brown, coals have often a brownish-black color, whence the name, and more oxygen, but iu these respects and others they shade into ordinary bituminous coals. The ordinary bituminous coal of Pennsylvania has G. = 1-26 \u2014 1 -37 : of Newcastle, Engla.id. 1*27; of Scotland, 1*27\u2014 1*32; of France, 1*2 \u2014 1-33; of Belgium, 1*27 \u2014 1-3. The most prominent kinds are the following: 3. Caring Coal. A bituminous coal which softens and becomes pasty or semi-viscid in the fire. This softening takes place at the temperature of incipient decomposition, and is attended with the escape of bubbles of gas. Ou increasing the heat, the volatile products which result from tho ultimate decomposition of the softened mass are driven off, and a coherent, grayish-black, cellular, or fritted mass (coke) is left. Amount of coke left (or part not volatile) varies from 50 to 85 p. c A caking coal will lose its caking quality if kept heated for 2 or 3 Lours at 300\u00b0 C, and sometimes on mere exposure for a time to the air."], [811, "755 MINERAL COAL. 4. Non-Cakinq Coal. Like the preceding in all external characters, and often in ultimate composition; but burning freely without softening or any appearance of incipient fusion. Per centage of volatile matter same as for caking coal, but the coke is not a proper coke, being in pow der, or of the form of the original coal. There are all gradations between caking and uou-caking bituminous coals. In external char acters the two kinds are alike. They often break into layers : and there is besides a horizontal banding arising from a suecession of very thin non-separable layers, slightly differing in lustre or shade of color. Cherry coal or soft coal (of England) is a non-caking coal igniting well and burn ing rapidly, while splint or hard coal ignites less readily, burns less rapidly, owing to the smaller amount of volatile matter. Coals which do not cake on burning are called free-burning coals while the caking are called binding coals. 5. Cannel Coal (Parrot Coal). A variety of bituminous coal, and often caking; but differing from the preceding in texture, and to some extent in composition, as shown by its products ot distillation. It is compact, with little or no lustre, and without any appearance of a banded structure ; and it breaks with a conchoidal fracture and smooth surfaces ; color dull black or grayish-black. On distillation it affords, after drying, 40 to 66 of volatile matter, and the material volatilized includes a large proportion of burning and lubricating oils, much larger than the above kinds of bituminous coal ; whence it is extensively used for the manufacture of such oils. It graduates into oil-producing coaly shales, the more compact of which it much resembles. The original Parrot coal is a cannel from near Edinburgh, which burns with a crackling noise, whence the name (Percy) ; and Horn coal, a kind from South Wales, which emits when burning something of the odor of burning horn. 6. Torbanite. A variety of cannel coal of a dark brown color, yellowish streak, without lustre, having a subconchoidal fracture ; H. = 2-25 ; G. = l*17 \u2014 1*2. Yields over 60 p. c. of volatile mat ter, and is used for the production of burning and lubricating oils, paraffin, illuminating gas. Named from tlie locahty at Torbaue Hill, near Bathgate in Linlithgowshire, Scotland, .Also called Boghead Cannel (see p. 742). 7. Brown Coal (Braunkohle Germ., Pechkohle pt. Germ., Lignite). The prominent character istics of brown coal have already been mentioned. They are non-caking, but afford a large proportion of volatile matter. They are sometimes pitch-black (whence Pechkohle pt. Germ.). but often rather dull and brownish-black. G. = 1'15 \u2014 1'3; sometimes higher from impurities. It is occasionally somewhat lamellar in structure. Brown coal is often called lignite. But this term is sometimes restricted to masses of coal which still retain the form of the original wood. Jet is a black variety of brown coal, compact in texture, and taking a good polish, whence its use iu jewelry. 8. Earthy Brown Coal (Erdige Braunkohle) is a brown friable material, sometimes forming layers in beds of brown coal. But it is in general not a true coal, a considerable part of it being soluble in ether aud benzole, and often even in alcohol ; besides affording largely of oils and paraffin on distillation. For a notice of \" coal \" of this kind see under Leucopetrite, p. 743 Such a coal is sometimes called wax coal and paraffin coal (Wachskohle, Paraffinkohle, Germ.). See also Bathvillite, p. 742. 9. Mineral Charcoal. Fibrous charcoal-like substance often found covering the surfaces between layers of coal, and observed in coal of all ages. It is soft, and soils the fingers like charcoal One variety of it is a dry powder. Comp. \u2014 Most mineral coal consists mainly, as the best chemists now hold, of oxygenated hydro carbons. On page 742 it is shown that the kind of cannel coal called torbanite and the sub stance bathvillite are closely related in composition, as well as insolubility, to the species of the Succinite group ; and it is probablo that other cannel coals contain this or some related compound ; and that oil-producing (not oil-bearing) shales include a similar kind of hydrocarbon. Tve ordinary bituminous coals often have 1 0 to 15 p. c. of oxygen, and may be of analogous composition, though differing much in the precise constitution of these hydrocarbons, some containing such as produce a pasty fusion or incipient decomposition when heated (caking), and others such as undergo no semi-fusion (non-caking). The brown coals, in which there are 20 to 35 p. c. of oxygen, must include other kinds of oxygenated hydrocarbons, of the insoluble kinds. But microscopic exam inations appear to show that woody fibre is present in it in various stages of alteration. Besides oxygenated hydrocarbons, there may also be present simple hydrocarbons (that is, con taining no oxygen). This would seem to follow from the small percentage of oxygen (2 \u2014 3 p. c.) in the Tyneside cannel, while the hydrogen is as large in amount as iu any cannel or bituminous coals. And there are various bituminous coals, low in oxygen, that suggest the same conclusion. At pres ent, however, chemistry knows of no simple hydrocarbons that are insoluble in naphtha and benzole. The presence of free carbon is naturally inferred from the composition of coals like the anthra cites, which afford very little volatile matter. But even these coals contain ordinarily 1*5 to 2-6 Lc. of each oxygen and hydrogen ; and Berthelot holds that they are hydrocarbon compounds e other coals. It is remarkable that in one of the analyses of anthracite from Piesberg, Han over (anal. 4), no oxygen whatever was found, while there were 2-23 p. c. of hydrogen."], [812, "756 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. Tlie portion of coal soluble iu naphtha or benzole, although small in am junt, indicates the pit senee of other hydrocarbons \u2014 simple or oxygenated \u2014 oils or resins. Their nature remains to be ascertained. Fyfe obtained by means of naphtha, from the Torbane mineral, 1*2 and 1*4 p. c. ; from cannel coal, 2 \u2014 4 p. c. ; and from Newcastle caking, in three experiments, 4'2, 5\"8, 9-8 p. c. of soluble material. These results do not accord with the ordinary statements with regard to tha insolubility of coal, and the subject needs far more extended study. Under microscopic examination, when in thin slices, many bituminous coals (including most cannel coals, the gas coals of Nova Scotia, Pclton, etc.) are seen to consist of three kinds of material, as first observed by Hutton (Geol. Soc. London, 1832-33), and further more particularly by Dr. Aitken of Glasgow (Ronalds pi Richardson, Chem. Teehn., i. 778). (1) An opaque black substance, which is insoluble in acids as well as other menstrua, and, aa suggested, may be free carbon (?). It is stated to be the main constituent of anthracite. (2) A yellow or reddish resin-like substance, which is translucent or transparent, volatile by heat, and insoluble in naphtha, muriatic and nitric acids. (3) Earthy matter, which is more or less soluble in water, and is earthy impurity. The resin like material, No. 2, may well be a species of the Succinite group (see above). In many pitchy bituminous coals it is impossible to make out the structure here described, on account of their opacity. Some Nova Scotia coal contains yellow matter, which is soluble in ether, and slightly so in turpentine and nitric acid; and the same is true of that of the Peltor coal. Many brown coals, as the Bovey, show the structure above described. Coals often contain resins disseminated in visible points through the mass, which may or mai not be of soluble kinds. Sulphur is present :n nearly all coals. It is supposed to be usually combined with iron, and when the coal affords a red ash on burning, there is reason for believing this true. But Percy mentions a coal from New Zealand (anal. 18) which gave a peculiarly white ash, although containing 2 to 3 p. c. of sulphur, a fact showing that it is present not as a sulphid of iron, but as a constituent of an organic compound. The discovery by Church of a resin containing sul phur (see Tasmanite, p. 746), gives reason for inferring that it may exist in this coal in that state, although its presence as a constituent of other organic compounds is quite possible. The presence ot nitrogen, sometimes 2 p. c, proves the presence of nitrogenous hydrocarbons; but of what nature is unknown. The above review of the composition of coal shows that as yet very little is known as to its actual constituents ; and that no analyses to determine them can be satisfactory which are not carried forward by the aid of the microscope, and by the preparatory separation of the coal into parts, as far as possible, by different menstrua, and the separate analyses of these parts. The impurities present, which constitute the ash of the coal, consist of silica or quartz, oxyd of iron, clay, and other aluminous sihcates, or such ingredients as make up the mud and elay of fine soil or alluvium ; also some silica, potash, and soda, derived from the original vegetation. The posh in the purest mineral coal amounts to but 0*25 to 1 p. c. ; but in that which passes for the best there are ordinarily 5 to 8 p. c. ; and in most that is used for fuel there are 8 to 15 p. c.

In the United States, the anthracites occur east ofthe Alleghany range, in rocks that have undergone great contortions and fracturings, while the bituminous are found farther west, in rocks that have been less disturbed ; and this fact and other observations have led some geologists to the view that tho anthracites have lost their bitumen by the action of heat. For observations on the geological rolations of coal beds, reference may be made to geological treatises. The origin of coal is mainly vegetable, though animal life has contributed somewhat to the result. The beds were once beds of vegetation, analogous, in most respects, in mode of formation to the peat beds of modern times, yet iu mode of burial often of a very different character. This vegetable origin is proved not only by the occurrence of the leaves, stems, and logs of plants inthe coal, but also by the presence throughout its texture, in many eases, of the forms of the original fibres ; also by the direct observation that peat is a transition state between unaltered vegetable debris and brown coal, being sometimes found passing completely into true brown coal. Peat differs from true coal in want of homogeneity, it visibly containing vegetable fibres only partially altered ; and wherever changed to a sine-textured homogeneous material, even though hardly consolidated, it may be true brown coal. The derivation of coal from woody fibre has been explained in a general way on page 75t From the statements there made it is obvious that the vegetable material, in changing to ordinary mineral coal, has not passed necessarily through the stage as brown coal When the materia]"], [815, "759 MINERAL COAL. was long steeped iu water, and buried under fine mud so as to exclude almost entirely atmospheric air, \"the decomposition in progress may have carried off most of the oxygen by its combination with the carbon of the plants, to form carbonic acid. Thus it happened probably with tbe cannel coals, as explained by Newberry, and also, though in general less perfectly, with most of the best oituminous coals. But when the bed had as free access to the air as occurs in tho case of peat beds, there would have been a loss of carbon and hydrogen as marsh-gas, and also, probably, through combination with external oxygen, forming carbonic acid and water, while a large part of the oxygen would remain. Between these extremes, of excluded air and very imperfectly excluded, aud of pressure from heavy superincumbent earthy beds and little or no pressure, lie the condi tions which attended the origin ofthe various kinds of \"coal, aud determined, in connection with the nature of the vegetation itself, the transformations iu progress. Extensive beds of mineral coal occur in Great Britain, covering about -fo the whole area, or 11,859 square miles; in France about -}2s, or 1719 sq. m. ; in Spain about -fo, or 3408 sq. m. ; in Belgium 2L2, or 518 sq. m. ; in Netherlands, Prussia, Bavaria, Austria, northern Italy, Silesia, Spain, Russia on the south near the Azof, and also in the Altai. It is found in Asia, abundantly iu China, in Persia in the Cabul territory, and ia the Khorassau or northern Persia, in Hindos tan, north of the Gulf of Cutch, in the province of Bengal (the Burdwau coal field) and Upper Assam, in Borneo, Labuan, Sumatra, several of the Philippines, Formosa, Japan, New South Wales and other parts of Australia, New Zealand, Kerguelen's Land ; in America, besides the United States, in Chili, at the Straits of Magellan, northwest America on Vancouver's Island near the harbor of Camosack, at Bellingham Bay ia Puget's Sound, at Melville Island in the Arctic seas, and in the British Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfound land. In the United States there are four separate coal areas. One of these areas, the Appalachian coal field, commences on the north, in Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio, and sweeping south over western Virginia and eastern Kentucky and Teunessee to the west of the Appalachians, or partly involved in their ridges, it continues to Alabama near Tuscaloosa, where a bed of coal has been opened. It has been estimated to cover 60,000 sq. m. It embraces several isolated patches in the eastern half of Pennsylvania. The whole surface in Pennsylvania has been estimated at 15,437 sq. m., or J the whole area of the State. A second coal area (the Illinois) lies adjoining the Mississippi, and covers the larger part of Illinois, though much broken into patches, and a small northwest part of Kentucky ; it is continued westward over a portion of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and northern Texas west of the Mississippi. The latter area is divided along the Mississippi by a narrow belt of Silurian rock; the whole area is about the same with that of the Appalachian coal field. A third co-vers the central portion of Michigan, not far from 5000 sq. m. in area. Besides these, there is a smaller coal region (a fourth) in Rhode Island, which crops out across the north end of the island of Rhode Island, and appears to the northward as far as Mansfield, Massachusetts. The total area of coal measures in the United States is about 125.0U0 sq. m. Out of the borders of the United States, on the northeast, commences a fifth coal area, that of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which covers, in connection with that of Newfoundland, 18,000 sq. m., or j the whole area of these provinces. The mines of western Pennsylvania commencing with those of the Blossburg basin, Tioga Co., those ofthe States west, and those of Cumberland or Frostburg, Maryland, Richmond or Ches terfield, Va., aud other mines south, are bituminous. Those of eastern Pennsylvania constituting several detached areas \u2014 one, the Schuylkill coal field, on the south, worked principally at Mauoh Chunk on the Lehigh, and at Pottsville on the Schuylkill\u2014 another, the Wyoming coal field, worked at Carbondale, in the Lackawanna region, and near Wyoming, besides others interme diate\u2014those of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and some patches in Virginia, are anthracites. Cannel coal is found near Greensburg, Beaver Co., Pa., in Kenawha Co., Va., at Peytona, etc. ; also in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana ; but part of the so-called cannel is a coaly shale. In England, the principal coal fields are the Manchester of Lancashire aud Cheshire ; the Great Central of South Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Derby ; that of South Wales, Glamorgan shire, etc.; the Newcastle field of northern England. In Scotland, a range of beds extends across from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde; whole area 1650 sq. m. In Ireland, the three are the Limerick fields about the mouth of the Shannon, the Kilkenny fields to the east ward, and that of Ulster on the north. Cannel coal occurs iu Great Britain at Lesmahago in Lanarkshire, about 20 m. from Glasgow ; also near Wigan in Lancashire, aud West Wemyss in Fyfe. Mineral coal occurs in France, in small basins, 88 iu number, and covering in all, according to Taylor, -\\T of the whole surface. The most important are the basin of the Loire, between the Loire aud tho Rhoue, aud that of Valenciennes on the north, adjoining Belgium. In Belgium, it occupies a western and eastern division, the western in the provinces of Namur and Hainaul1*, and the eastern extending over Liege."], [816, "760 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. Browi. coal comes from coal beds more recent than those ofthe Carboniferous age. But muck of this more recent coal is not distinguishable from other bitumiuous coals. The ceal of Rich mohd, Virginia, is supposed to be of the Liassic or Triassic era; the coal of Brora, iu Sutherland, and of Bovey, Yorkshire, is Oolitic iu age. Tertiary coal occurs on the Cowlitz. in Oregon (anal. 14). and in many places over the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, where a \"Lig nitic formation \" is very widely distributed ; but it is rarely in beds of economical importance. The coal known to the Greeks aud Romans was probably brown coal The first sentence, in Ihe synonymy, from Aristotle evide itly alludes to mineral coal of some kind ; and the first of the two cited from Theophrastus (a favorite rj-jpil of Aristotle) refers to a similar substance, and per haps the same specimens. The locality of the latter, Liguria (or northwestern Italy along the Mediterranean), where, ho adds, there also is amber, may be taken with some freedom, as articles brought by vessels trading with Ligurian ports, even though coming from French ports beyond, might be referred to Liguria. Elis, on the way to Olympias, is given as another locality. The sentence ends with the statement that \" these coals are used by tho smiths,\" showing that the value of the substance as fuel was well understood at the time (4th century B.C.). Theophrastus says further, that it will continue to burn as long as any one blows it, but on stopping it deadens, but may be made to burn again ; and that it burns with a strong disagreeable odor. The second cita tion from each, Aristotle and Theophrastus, relates to a similar coal. Trie locality, in Thrace, identities it with the Thracian stone of Dioscorides aud Pliny, the locality of which, according to the former (from Aristotle), was at Sintia, on the river Pontus (on the Macedonian border of Thracia, to the west of the present Constantinop'e). According to Dioscorides and Pliny (quot ing further in part from Aristotle's \" Wonderful Things heard of\"), water would make the Thra cian stone to burn, aud oil extinguish it ; which is either altogether a fable, or a partial truth based on somebody's observation that masses or piles of impure pyritiferous coal will become hot, and sometimes ignited, in consequence of being wet. Aristotle mentions its bituminous odor when burning. The Gagales (whence our word jet) occurred, according to Dioscorides and Pliny, at Gagas or Gages, a place in Lycia (Asia Minor). The former describes it as black, smooth, and combustible, to which Pliny adds, that it was light, and looked much like wood, and that it emitted a disagree able odor when rubbed, and burned with the smell of sulphur. It was, in part at least, true lig nite. Lignite is common in Syria, in the rocks of Mt. Lebanon, as near Beirut; and beds of coal have been recently opened in Asia Minor.

B.B. infusible ; smaller crystals become opaque white; larger in outer flame reddish, aud light yellow in inner. With borax, on platinum wire, dissolves with extreme slowness and difficulty to a transparent globule, sometimes faint greenish ; with more borax opaque on flaming. With salt of phosphorus slowly dissolved, pro ducing a faint green color. Obs.\u2014 From the Azores, in an albitic rock, along with black tourmaline and pyrrhite. First distinguished and described by J. E. Teschemacher. The largest crystal seen was but 1| lines in diameter. There is some resemblance in form to cryptolite (p. 529), but a re-examination of the species by Mr. Hayes corroborates his first announcement that the mineral contains neither cerium nor phosphoric acid. The angle 123\u00b0 15' is near that of zircon, and it is possible that it is that species. But Tesche macher says of its hardness, that \"it just scratches fluor spar.\" 833. BREWSTERLINITE. A new fluid in the cavities of minerals D. Brewster, Ed. Phil. J., ix. 1823; Trans. R. Soc. Edinb., x. 1, 407, 1826; Am. J. Sci., vii 186, 1824, xii. 214 (with a plate), 1827 ; Phil Mag., IV. xxv. 174, 1863. Brewsterline Dana, Min., 559, 1850; Brewsto- line, ib., 471, 1854. \u2022 In a vacuum (or as it occurs in the cavities of crystals) a colorless trans parent fluid, adhering but slightly to the enclosing mineral, and hence very voluble ; expanding about one-fourth with an increase of 16jj\u00b0 C. (30\u00b0 F.), or between 10\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 C. (50\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 FA 21 times more expansible than water ; index of refraction 1-2106, for the fluid from an amethyst from Siberia; 1*1311 for a kind from a topaz ; boiling point in a vacuum from 23\u00b0 to 29\u00b0 C. (74\u00b0 to 84\u00b0 F.), the fluid filling the cavities with the warmth of the hand or mouth. On exposure to the air undergoes rapid movements, spreading over the surface and contracting again, and then dries to separate particles or grains, which are lustrous and appear to be opaque, but are transparent by trans mitted light ; by the approach of moisture, even the moisture of the hand, even after being dry for some days, becomes liquid again, and renews its rapid movements. Soluble without effervescence in sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids. Volatilized by heat. Comp. \u2014 Unknown. The effect of moisture on the dry grains shows that tho substance is no' one of the hydrocarbon oils, or a resin. Obs.\u2014 Occurs in cavities of topaz crystals from Brazil, Scotland and Australia, of chrysoberyl, of quartz crystals from Quebec, amethyst from Siberia, aud first described by Sir David Brewster"], [818, "762 UNCLASSIFIED SPECIES. The cavities are mostly microscopic, but occasionally J in. across, or even larger. They are gen erally arranged in layers, and are sometimes counted by thousands in a single crystal. Brewster counted 30,000 in a chrysoberyl \\ in. square. The strata run irregularly with reference to tha symmetry ofthe crystal, ofteu intersect one another, and are sometimes curved; it is rare that 3 or 4 strata are parallel. The very low refracting power, less than that of water, is a remarka ble character ofthe fluid (the refraction index of water being 1-336 ; of alcohol 1-361 ; of ethei 1-358). The fluid from a quartz crystal from Quebec, which exploded with much force when heated, had a disagreeable taste. In his original memoir Brewster states that the fluid was 32 times more expansible than water, but in tbe later reference to it in 1863 (Phil. Mag., 1 c.) makes it 21 times. The lower index of refraction, 1*1311, obtained for the fluid of a topaz, is so much below the other, 1-2106, that it may indicate a distinct species. 834. CRYPTOLINITE. A new fluid, etc., Brewster (see for res, Brewsteblinite). Crypto- line Dana, Min., 559, 1850. A colorless transparent fluid, as observed in the cavities of crystals, like brewsterlinite, but more dense ; adhering like water to the enclosing sur faces ; expansibility about that of water ; index of refraction 1*2946. Not soluble in, or a solvent of, brewsterlinite, the two, when occurring together, not being miscible. On exposure to the air hardens speedily to a resin-like substance ; bril liant in lustre ; yellowish; transparent; absorbent of moisture, but much less so than brewsterlinite ; insoluble in water and alcohol ; rapidly dissolved with effervescence by sulphuric acid, and soluble also in nitric and muri atic acids ; not volatilized by heat. Comp. \u2014 Nothing is known. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in the same crystals, and generally the same cavities, with brewsterlinite. This denser of the two fluids, according to Brewster, occupies the angles of the cavities, or the necks or narrow passages which unite two or more large cavities, while the other rarer fluid floats on it, and fills the rest of the cavity, excepting a circular vacuity, occupied only by this fluid in the gaseous state, if at all 835.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs imbedded in danburite and orthoclase, and only in very minute crystals, at Dan bury, Ct. Shepard made the crystallization erroneously tetragonal. There are also other discrepancies in his description, which might lead to the supposition that the mineral here described is a different mineral from Shepard's ; but the evidence to the contrary is complete. 837. PYRRHITE. G. Rose, Pogg., xlviii. 562. 1840. Isometric ; in octahedrons. Cleavage not observed. H.=6. Lustre vitreous. Color orange-yellow. Subtranslucent. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. infusible, but blackens, and colors the flame deep yellow. In fragments diffi cultly soluble in salt of phosphorus, but in fine powder it is readily taken up by this salt, as well as by borax, forming a clear glass when cold if only a small portion is used, while if saturated it is yellowish-green, becoming somewhat more intense in R.F. Fused with soda on charcoal, it spreads out and is absorbed by the coal, giving a slight white coating, somewhat resembling oxyd of zinc ; it yields no metallic spangles when the surface of the coal is removed and rubbed in the mortar. Insoluble in muriatic acid (G. Rose). Obs.\u2014 Pyrrhite was found by von Perovski of St. Petersburg at Alabaschka, near Mursinsk in the Ural, where it occurs in drusy feldspar cavities, containing also lepidolite, albite, and topaz. The largest crystal was but three lines long. Named from xvpfc, yellowish-red or fire-like. With this species J. E. Teschemacher identifies small orange-red, monometric octahedrons, fouudwith albite at the Azores (J. Nat. H. Bost., iv. 499, 1844; Proc. id., ii. 108, 1S46). along with tetragonal octahedrons of azorite (p. 761). The crystals are a half lo two lines long, and those of minute size are transparent. According to chemical and blowpipe trials by A. A. Hayes (Am. J. Sci., II. ix. 423) on speci mens furnished him by Mr. Teschemacher, these crystals consist of columbate of zirconia, colored apparently by oxyds of iron, uranium, and manganese. B.B. in the forceps, on the first impulse of the heat, becomes darker, and the fine orange color returns on cooling, even if the heat has been high ; at tho melting point of cast iron, in the reduction flame, the flame becomes permanently darker and brown. With borax (6 parts to 1 of assay) it dissolves, and affords a clear colorless glass, which becomes instantly opaline or opaque on flaming ; transferred to the oxydating flame becomes opaque. With salt of phos phorus (in the same proportion) in tho inner flame gives a clear glass, and when reduced the glass is green; but in the outer becomes yellow. With a little more of assay the glass remains clear. With soda (12 parts to 1 of assay) dissolves; some clear portions are seen in the globule while hot, but on cooling opacity precedes the crystallization of the globule ; finally a gray-brown slag remains, which, cooled from the outer flame, has a green color, indicating oxyd of manganese. Decomposed by much soda, and the resulting mass, heated with nitric acid, gives a heavy, white, insoluble powder, which with boiling water takes a white flocculent form ; the powder exhibited all tho characters of columbic acid ('?). The acid solution, when mixed with carbonate of ammonia, remains clear ; heated, some oxyd of iron falls, and the fluid is light"], [820, "764 UNCLASSIFIED SPECIES. yellow; with oxalic acid, a white earth separates, which, heated with sulphuric acid to destroj the oxalic acid, dissolves, and the fluid forms with potash, before complete neutralization, r white double salt, which has the characters of that from zirconia, but may also contain oxyd of cerium. The oxalate, when first formed, did not afford, when heated, the cinnamon-brown color characteristic of deutoxyd of cerium. The extremely small amount of the mineral urnier examination forbids the expression of certainty respecting the base. Although inclining to the opinion of the existence of cerium in the mineral, from the red color of the crystals, Mr. Haves observes that he obtained no positive proof on this point. 834 AXURGITE.

Univ Geneve, Aug. 25, 1867, p. 286): 6b, ti Sn th Ce La, Di Y Fe Ca ign. 51-45 0*18 15-75 18*49 5*60 U12 3T7 2-75* 1-07=99-58. G.=5*23. The amount of metallic acids.varied between 51-15 and 51-75. Analyses of tho metallic acid gave the relation, Cb 29*31, Ti 22*14, differing materially from Hermann's results. Marignac, having previously examined the acids of euxenite (see p. 522), concludes that the rela tion between the metallic acids is the same as iu \u00e6schynite, and that these two minerals differ mainly in the character of the bases they contain ; and that both may be represented by the general formula 5 R ti + 2 tt,' Cb. Agnesite. Carbonate of Bismuth W. Macgregor, Sowerby's English Min., Beud., Tr., ii. 375, 1832; Agnesite B. <fc M. Min., 591, 1852. An earthy steatite-like mineral from St. Agnes in Corn wall, having G.=4*31, made by Macgregor to consist of C 51*3, Bi 28*8, Fe 2-1, Al 7*5, Si 6*7, H 3 6=100 ; which result is pronounced by Beudant as probably \" quolque grande erreur,\" and so proved by Thomson (Min., iu 594), who states, after personal trials, that it did \" not effervesce with acids, and contained only a trace of bismuth\"; and also by Greg and Lettsom, who examined a specimen in the late Mr. Allan's collection, from Mr. Macgregor, with the same result as to effer vescence, and say that it may be an impure bismuth ochre. Allan appears to have thought it unworthy of a place in his edition of Phillips' Mineralogy (1837), and does not even allude to it under bismuth ochre. Altaite (48, p. 44). This rare species has been identified at the Stanislaus mine, Cal, and F. A Genth has also observed it in minute quantities associated with petzito at the Golden Rule mine, Cal. (Am. J. ScL, II. xiv. 311). The mineral from the former locality is tin- white, with a yel lowish tinge, tarnishing to bronze-yellow; streak gray; with H. =3, and has a distinctly cubic cleavage. Composition, after deducting in 1, 1*03 p. c, and in 2, 1*96 of quartz : 1. Te 37*31 Pb 60*71 Ag 1-17 Au 0*26=99*45. 2. [37*00] 47-84 1130 3 86=10000. No. 1 is the first comnlete analysis of this species, and confirms the assumption of Rose that it is a compound analogous to hessite. Dr. Genth calculates No. 1 to contain 99*25 p. c. of altaite and 2*20 of hessite ; and No. 2, 77*42 altaite, and 23-11 p. c. hessite. An earlier result on another specimen obtained by Genth, after separating carbonates and excluding 8 p. c. free gold, and 3-45 quartz, gave Te (37-14), Ag 44-49, Pb 18-37 = 100*00. This may represent 70-85 hessite, and 29*26 altaite. The material appeared to be pure, but Genth states that further investigation is needed to ascertain whether there is a tellurid of silver, or tellurid of silver and lead, which has a white color and cubic cleavage. Amphibole (247, p. 232). Compact asbestus from Bolton, Mass., afforded T. Petersen (Jahresb 'or 1866, 924, 1868) : Si 58-80 il tr. te 3-05 Mg 22-23 Ca 1647 fl \u2022*\u25a0*-.= 100 65.

The chiastolite of Lancaster, Mass., afforded T. Peterseu (Jahresb 1866, 921): Si 41*95 Al 48-60 Pe 9*30 Ca 0*41 = 100-26. G.=2*923. Anorthite (310, p. 337). Tankite is referred to anorthite on p. 337, on the authority of Descloi zeaux, who has found them to have the same forms of crystals and angles (Mem. Soc. Min. St Pet., IL il 1867). Descloizeaux also publishes (1. c.) the following analyses of tankite by Pisani* Si 42-49, Al 34*7^ Pe 0*74, fig 0-30, Ca 15-82, Na, Li 1-00, K 0-63, fl, F 4-80=101-08 ; whence the oxygen ratio, E, it, Si, 1 : 3 : 4. The mineral is from the iron mines of Arendal, Norway, where it was originally obtained by Mr. Tank. Anorthite crystals from the Juvenas meteorite have been measured by v. Lang (Pogg., cxxxiii. 188). Arsenopyrite (94, p. 78). Von Zepharovich has measured crystals of this species, with th\u00ab foUowing results (Ber. Ak.

The following are additional observations on this species: Artif. \u2014 Field has shown (Phil. Mag., IV. xxiv. 123) that when an alkaline hypochlorite is added to a boiling solution of the sulphate, nitrate, or chlorid of copper, the latter being in excess, the precipitate produced has the formula 3 pfiufl+Cu Clfl. The same is formed when potash is added to an excess of chlorid of copper. If, in the first case given above, the time of ebullition is too short, the precipitate has the composition 3 Cu fl + Cu Cl fl + 2 aq. Field's analysis gave Cu 49*85, Cu Cl 28 02, fl 2*2-13, agreeing very closely, as he observed, with that of Berthier (anal. 1) from Cobija, Bolivia. The formula requires Cu 49*56, CuCl 28*01, fl 22-43=100. This is also the composition of botallackite. Field states also that atacamite is formed in Chili at a seashore locality by the action of salt in the soil on chalcopyrite. Debray finds that crystals may be obtained by heating to 200\u00b0 C, Cu'N with a concentrated solution of common salt; or to 100\u00b0 C, ammoniacal sulphate of copper with the same. Babingtonite (242, p. 227). The small black, brilliant crystals from Athol referred to babing tonite by Shepard (p. 228), do not afford very nearly the angles of that species. They are usually implanted on green epidote, and, although black, they appear, under a glass, to pass so gradually into the underlying mineral that the first impression is naturaUy that they are only a black variety of epidote. Yet they differ also from this species in angle. The author has\" attempted to make new measurements, but the crystals for the purpose were so minute (-,1-,- of an inch in length) that they require further study for satisfactory results. The author's figure and \" approximate measurements \" from the last edition of this work are consequently here added without modification, or even the change in the lettering that is require! 617 to bring the figure into parallelism with the figures of babingtonite.

Melanterhe (664, p. 646). An impure sulphate of iron, apparently a mixture of melanterite and a sulphate ofthe sesquioxyd (as remarked by Kenngott, TJeb. 1865), from Bourboule, in the Dept. of Puy de Dome, France, has been named Bourboulite by Lefort (C.

It is a friable greenish substance, partly soluble in water and partly in acid's."], [857, "801 SUPPLEMENT. Melonite F. A. Genth, Am. J. Sci., II. xiv. 313, 1868. (100A, Appendix to Sulphids, etc.) A new tellurium mineral from among the ores of the Stanislaus mine. Form hexagonal, with eminent basal cleavage. Generally in indistinct granular and foliated particles. Lustre metallic; color reddish-white, rarely tarnished brown ; streak dark gray. Composition Nij Te3=Te 76-49, Ni 23-51 = 100. An analysis afforded Te 73*43, Ag 4*0S, Pt 0'72, Ni 20 98=99-21; the nickel contained a minute trace of cobalt. B.B. in the open tube gives a sublimate fusing to colorless drops, leaving a gray mass ; on charcoal burns with a bluish lame, giving a white volatile coating, and a greenish-gray residue ; in R.F. with soda a gray powder of magnetic metallic nickel. Soluble in nitric acid, giving a green color, and on evapora tion yielding a white crystalline powder of tellurous acid. Genth considers the analysis to correspond to 6*60 p. c. hessite, 1*17 altaite, 2*29 native tel lurium, aud 89*25 meionite, which he assumes to have the composition Nia Te3, although he observes that the hexagonal form would better agree with the formula Ni Te. But the latter view would require that over one-third of the mixture should be native tellurium, which he thinks scarcely probable, as the material for analysis, when examined by a strong magnifier, showed a small quantity of dark colored hessite, but every other particle had a reddish hue, without the slightest admixture apparently of any grayish-white mineral. Menaccanite (181, p. 143). A variety of this species, from the basalt of Turner's Hill quarry, Staffordshire, gave D. Forbes (Phil. Mag., IV: xxxiv. 347), after excluding silicates and insoluble, ti 34*28, Pe 65*72; G.=4*69. Mica Group. A micaceous mineral has been named Helvelan by R. T. Simmler (his Petriia, 9, Kenng. TJeb. 1865, 135, 1868), but without a determination of its composition or exact relations to other species. It forms part of a schist and quartzite in the gneiss formation (Alpinyte) of the Alps. H.=3\u2014 3-5; G.=2-77\u2014 3-03 ; lustre pearly or waxy; color gray to whitish, reddish, greenish, violet, and copper-red ; streak grayish-white to reddish. In the closed tube yields little or no water. B.B. fuses with difficulty on the edges ; the borax pearl is colorless when cold. Not attacked by hot acids. Stated to consist probably of silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of iron. A micaceous mineral from Chester Co., Pa., has been named Pattersonile by I. Lea (Proc. Ac. Philad., 1867, 45), but without the mention of its distinctive characters. Montanite (711, p. 668). Dr. Genth has detected this tellurato with the tetradymite of David son Co., N. C. (Am. J.

Chabazite and apophyllite in fine crystals are other results of the action of the waters of Plom bieres on the brick and mortar of an old Roman aqueduct, besides hyalite, aragonite, and perhaps scolecite and harmotome. Pyrite (75, p. 62). The pyrite associated with the niccoliferous pyrrhotite of Inverary, Scot land, gave D. Forbes (Phil.

Forbes says that, in the examination of several hundred specimens of pyrite and pyrrhotite from different localities, nickel is rarely found in pyrite, while often present in pyrrhotite ; on the contrary, cobalt is rather common in pyrite, and, compared with nickel, in quite small quantity in pyrrhotite.

Mass., 315, 1835, 369, 1841), and laternamed Canaanite in Alger's Min., 1844, after an analysis (see below) by S. L. Dana. It is a whitish and grayish-white rock, subcrystalline in fracture, with H. = 6-5 and G. = 3'07, and constitutes ridges in the vicinity of Canaan, Ct. It is overlaid by a dolomite, abounding in some layers in crystals of whitish pyroxene, and at the junc tion is much mixed with tti& dolomite. Dr. Dana obtained in his analysis (Hitchcock's Rep., 569, 1841): Si 53-37 Sl 10-38 Pe 4*50 fig 1*62 Ca 25*80 0 4*00=99*67. A specimen has been recently analyzed by B. S.

Del Rio described a carbonate of silver from Real Catoree, Mexico, where it is called Plata Azul (Gilb. Ann., lxxi. 11), which also is regarded as a mixture. Serpentine (411, p. 464).

The tenorite, or oxyd of copper (CuO) in small delicate folia, occurring at Vesuvius, possesses, according to Maskelyno (Rep. Brit. Assoc, 1865, 33), double refraction, and moreover is optically biaxial. This author also states that there are two equal cleavages inclined to one another 72\u00b0. As the names tenorite and melaconite were given the same year, and tenorite was made non-isometric (hexagonal) by its describer, it appears to be right that tenorite should be sustained for the above mineral, and melaconite be left for the isome tric kind, if any such proves to be a native species. That there is an isometric form of this CuO has been announced by Becquerel, as stated on p. 137. Tenorite may have the form and dimen sions found by Jenzsch in crystals of Cu 0 from the hearth of a furnace (1 c), or those approxi mately of brookite ; and this would place it near brookite in the system, under the chemical for mula Gu 0- (analogous to that of brookite). Having this place in the arrangement it would be numbered 198B. Melaconite crystals from Cornwall, collected by Mr. Tailing, have been described by Maske lyne (1 c.) as monoclinic, with the planes O, i-i, I, 1,-1, 6-i, 6-6, and 0Ai-i=8O\u00b0 28'. No measured angles are given, but only tho deduced dimensions. They have basal cleavage easy. The crystals are often twins, and the composition-face in some of them is i-i. H. a little above 4 ; G.=5*82527. Church has ascertained that the crystals are essentially pure Cu O. It would appear, according to these observations, that this oxyd of copper is trimorphous ; and there exists a doubt whether tenorite may not have this oblique form. Tetradymite (31, p. 30). F. A. Genth has analyzed tetradymite from Highland, Montana Ter ritory, and from the Ph\u0153nix mine, Cabarras Co., N. C, as follows (Am. J. Sci., II. xiv. 317): Te Bi S Pe Cu Quartz. 1.

No. 1 gives the ratio of Bi and Te 2 : 3, like the tetradymite from Fluvanna Co., Va., and Field's mine, Ga. No. 2 contains a small amount of pyrite, leaving 4*40 p. c. sulphur combined with the bismuth, and giving the ratio of S, Te, Bi=l : 2*03 : 2=Bi** S3+2 Bi2 Te3. Tetrahedrite (125, p. 100).

(1808), describes and figures crystals of sphene from Zillerthal, Greiseralp, St. Marcel (greenovite), Santorin. In the lettering on the figures, pp. 383, 384, and in the accompanying text, the minus symbols should properly (according to the principle on p. xxvii) bo plus, and the reverse. Triciute, Belonite. The name Trichiie (from Bois, hair) is applied by Zirkel (ZS. G, xix. 744, 1867) to microscopic capillary forms, often curved, bent, or zigzag, sometimes stellately aggregated, opaque and black or reddish-brown, of undetermined nature, which he detected in some kinds of glassy or semi-glassy volcanic rocks ; and Belonite (ib., 73s) to microscopic acicular crystals (whence the name, from HiX6i.ii, a needle), colorless and transparent. The trichite, he states, is not pyrox ene or hornblende ; the belonite may be a feldspar. Tridymite Vom Rath, Vorgetr. Ch. Ges. Bonn, March 7, 1866, pub. in 1868 (copy ree'd from v. R., .May 8, 1868). (231 A.) Besides the two well-known forms of silica, quartz and opal, and the two problematical forms described by Jenzsch (pp. 201, and below), another is announced by -i Rath under the above name. Tridymite occurs iu small hexagonal tables, colorless and transparent, which are usually com pound, and mostly of three individuals. It has G. = 2*2 \u2014 2*3, or the low specific gravity of opa.\". instead of that of ordinary quartz. Vom Rath alludes to the possibility of its being a pseudo morph of some unknown mineral, but observes that it has the double refractioD of a substance optically uniaxial. It occurs in druses in a volcanic porphyry, from Cerro St Cristoval, near Pachucha, Mexico, along with crystals of hematite and needles of a gold-lustred hornblende. Named in allusion to its compound forms of three individuals, or trins, from TpiHjiai. Uranophane Websky, ZS. G., v. 427, 1853, xl 384. (376B?)

The crystals here referred occur mostly in melaphyre, and the localities mentioned are mainly in Saxony and the Thuringer Waid. Volgesite (229, p. 188). The name Volgerite was given by the author (Min., 142, 1854) to Volger's mineral, for which Volger wrote the formula adopted as that of the species on p. 188 The African mineral analyzed by Cumenge, which is referred on the same page to Volgerite, although of somewhat doubtful composition, is the Cumengite of Kenngott (Min., 29, 1853). Wasite J. F. Bahr, Pogg., cxix. 572, 1863. A mineral resembling allanite, of a brownish-black color, but yellowish-brown in thin splinters and powder, with traces of cleavage in one direction. According to a qualitative examination by Bahr, it contains silica, alumina, yttria, sesquioxyd of iron, cerium, didymium, calcium, manganese, lime, alkali, a trace of uranium, without glucina, together with the oxyd of a new metal he named wasium (after the royal family of Wasa, Sweden). In a later paper (Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxxxii. 127), Bahr makes this oxyd thoria. Nickles had sug gested previously that it might be impure cerium. From Ronsholm, an island near Stockholm. The relations of the mineral remain doubtful. Wernerite (299, p. 320). The pink scapolite of Bolton, Mass., yielded T.

Stockh., 1868, 399. The so-called basic fluorid of cerium, from Bastnas, examined by Hisinger, has been reexamined by A. E. Nordenskiold, and shown to be a fluo-carbonate. As the name basic fluorid, or hydrofluocerite, conveys an incorrect idea of the composition of the mineral, Nordenskiold gives it the new name hamartite, overlooking the fact that Huot had already named the mineral bastnasite, after the locality.

Frenzel further distinguishes two varieties of hypochlorite, antimony-hypochlorite from Braunsdorf, and bismuth-hypochlorite from Schneeberg ; both of tfiese are stated to be mixtures, and not homogeneous minerals. 189. Chrompicotile. T. Petersen, J. pr. Ch., cii. 137. A variety of chromite occurring in rounded octahedrons. H=8. G =4*115. Lustre vit reous to greasy. Color black. Analysis by T. Petersen and K.

Mg 14*08=101*22 This composition does not differ much from that of the magnesian alumina chromite from Baltimore, analyzed by Abich (Anal. 3. 4, p. 153), and that from Lake Memphramagog, examined by Hunt. If this variety is to have a new name it should have reference to chro mite rather than picotite, a magnesia iron alumina spinel with only 7 per cent, of chromio oxyd. Its hardness is the chief character which favors its being classed with picotite. From Dun Mountain, New Zealand. 554 C. Coerdleolactite. Coeruleolactin, T. Petersen, Jahrb. Min., 1871, 353.

Hermann : Si & Cu fl 26-90 0-95 49-63 16-52. According to Hermann, this shows the composition to be equivalent to 1 atom oi libethenite, and 9 atoms of chrysocolla. It is evidently a substance of like character with the demidoffite of Nordenskiold. In the tube gives off water and becomes black. With the fluxes reacts for copper. Decomposed by acids without gelatinization. Occurs at Nischne-Tagilsk. 452. Diabantachronnyn. A name given by Liebe (Jahrb. Min., 1870, 1) to a chlorite-like mineral occurring in the diabase of Voigtland and Frankenwald, and which contributes to the green color of the rock. It is found in seams and clefts, sometimes in amygdules and lining cavities in the rock. In some occurrences of diabase it forms the chief binding oi cementing material, and is apparently a product of the alteration of the augitic constituent of the diabase.

Zepharovich, Sitzb. Ak. Wien, lxiii. 130. In endeavoring to ascertain the cause of the difference of the views of crystaUographers in regard to the crystallization of freieslebenite, Zepharovich has discovered that the speci mens referred to this species belong to two distinct crystalline systems, although chemi cally they are identical. He retains the name of freieslebenite for the monoclinic form, and names the new orthorhombic mineral dktphorite. The following planes were observed: i-i, i-i, i-%, I, ii-, i-K}, j-S, i-5, i-ii, 1,-i, 1-i, \\-i, 1-i, |-\u00ab, %-i, 2-i, i-&, H, 1, h l--> i-%, 1-4. Cleavage not observed. Fracture uneven to sub-conchoidal. fi.=2-5-3. G.=5*902, (Freieslebenite G. =6*35). Lustre metallic. Color steel-gray. Brittle. An analysis of the mineral from Przibram gave Helmhacker (B. and H.

These ana lyses Zepharovich refers to diaphorite, as no freieslebenite occurs at Przibram. The pyro gnostic characters of both species are the same. Diaphorite occurs at Przibram and Braunsdorf exclusively, while at Freiberg it is found with freieslebenite. The name diaphorite was formerly used for an altered rhodonite related to allagite. 503 A.

The oxygen ratio of A, S and As is 3 \"74 : 11-07 : 19-16, or nearly 1:3:5, giving the formula (i R3 + J 38) As, in which a portion of the oxygen is replaced by fluorine. In the closed tube blackens at a moderate temperature, but regains its color on cooling at a higher heat fuses easily to a yellow glass and gives a faint white volatile sublimate, etching the tube slightly.

With soda and charcoal powder in a matrass yields a subli mate of metallic arsenic. With the fluxes reacts for iron and manganese. In the forceps fuses at 2, giving an intense soda flame. Decomposed by sulphuric acid with evolution of fluohydric acid. Found near Durango in Mexico. The chemical composition of this mineral places it near amblygonite, an analogous fluo-phosphate, although the form of durangite is monoclinio while amblygonite is triclinic. 35. Dyscrasite. T. Petersen (Pogg. Ann., cxxxvii. 377), in a review of the analyses of dyscrasite, endeavors to show that there are two native compounds of antimony and silver, to one of which he gives the name stibiotriargentite (Ag3 Sb'2), pand the other, stibiohexargen tite Ag6 Sb*2. The former has a density of 9 '611-9 -77, and the latter 10-027. All recorded analyses that do not give one of these formulas he considers either to be erroneous or to have been made on a mixture of the above minerals. 617 A. Eosite. A. Schrauf, Min.

Heated in the closed tube darkens, but regains its color on cooling. Fused with bi-sulphate of potash gives a mass which is light yellow while hot, becomes, on cooling, first reddish-brown and finally brownish orange-yellow. This dissolved in water and boiled with tin-foil colors the solution faint greenish-blue. Not so rapidly acted upon by muriatic acid as crocoite or wulfenite. When a splinter of eosite is placed on a glass plate, and treated with muriatic acid, with subsequent addition of alcohol, and then gently evaporated, it affords a blue to bluish-green coating, with a green precipitate on the edges. From these reactions, and a series of comparative tests made with crocoite, wulfenite, and vanadinite, Schrauf concludes that eosite is vanadio-molybdate of lead. Found implanted in very minute crystals on pyromorphite and cerussite at Leadhills, Scotland. 122 A. Epiboulangerite. M. Websky, ZS. G. Ges., 1869, p. 747.

Klaproth olite is generally associated with a cobalt-tetrahedrite, while wittichenite is usually found with smaltite.

Chem. , II. i. 447), and called attention to the close correspondence of this species in physical characters with vauquelinite, and also to the fact that the analyses were made on material from the very specimens from which Berzelius ob tained the vauquelinite. By assuming that what Berzelius weighed as chromic acid was really phosphate of chromium, the results of the analysis are made to approximate very closely to those of Nordenskiold ; and Hermann believes that laxmannite is probably identical with vauquelinite. But Nordenskiold shows in his investigation that there is associated with lax mannite a chromate free from phosphoric acid corresponding to the vauquelinite of Berze lius. Hermann has also analyzed a phospho-chromate from Beresof, to which he gives the name pliospfiochromite, a mineral resembling laxmannite in physical characters, but con taining Cr P Pb Cu te S G.=5*80 10*13 9*94 68*33 7-36 2-80 1-16=99.72 This mineral occurs in rounded masses of half a pound weight, made up of globular par ticles, which exteriorly are covered with smaU tabular crystals with rounded terminations. It would seem possible that this aggregate might be a mixture rather than a distinct species ; and this may perhaps also be true in regard to laxmannite. A chromo-phosphate of lead and copper from the same locality was described by John (this Min., p. 631) as early as 1845, but was thought to be an impure vauquelinite. 554. Lime- Wavellite.

A mineral of the same composition and form, likewise unalterable in air, found at Stass furth, has been referred by Groth and Hintze to bloedite, these authors assuming that the efflorescence of bloedite, noticed by earlier observers, was due to mixture with some efflo rescent salt.

Jeremejew has discovered minute crystals of diamonds irregularly distributed through plates of xanthophyllite from the Sehisohimskian Mountains near Slat oust. They are readily recognized when magnified 30 diameters, and with 200 diameters their crystalline form is seen to be that of the hexa-tetrahedron 3-| combined with the tetra hedron, the first four being distinctly convex, while the tetrahedral plane is flat (like fig. 59 p. 21, except that there are also small flat tetrahedral planes). Most of the crystals are colorless. They are symmetrically disposed in their matrix, their trigonal intermediate axes being vertical to the foliation of the xanthophyllite. The green plates of this mineral, near est the rounded masses of the talcose slate and serpentine enclose unusually large numbera of them and they are likewise found in the two rocks themselves.

Lesleyite is found associ ated with diaspore and both minerals have a peculiarity in regard to their hardness that suggests a want of homogeneity. They are easily scratched with a knife, but they both contain particles which scratch topaz. Under the magnifier they both present glistening scales which are soft and apparently micaceous. It is evident that the minerals are mix tures of corundum and probably diaspore with a mica similar to the damourite found at the lesleyite locality ; and that the foliated soft mineral is damourite or a hydrous mica near that species.

This Second Appendix to Dana's Jlineralogy, prepared with the co-operation of the author, is designed to make the work complete up to January, 1875. It includes descriptions of all species announced as new within the past seven years, with the exception of those contained in Appendix I. , prepared by Prof. Brush. The names of the latter are, however, also included, with such new facts in regard to them as have been brought out since 1872. In addition, references are given under the name of each species to all important articles relating to it that have appeared since the publication of the Jlineralogy early in 1868. On account of the limited space and time at command, the work, in this latter respect, is, how ever, little more than an index, yet the attempt has been made to indicate so far as possible the character of each article \u2014 i. e., whether it contains a description of crystals (cryst.), or an analysis (anal. ), or a discussion of the chemical composition (comp.). Whenever new facts of special importance have been made known in regard to any species, this is noted at somewhat greater length. An alphabetical arrangement has been adopted for convenience of reference. A list of the more important of recent mineralogical works is added, and also the titles of some me moirs which, owing to their general character, seemed to require a special mention. For the explanation of abbreviations, see Dana's Jlin., pp. xxxv. -xiv. The black-faced figures, prefixed to names of new species, are intended to indicate their position as arranged in the classification adopted in the Jlineralogy : it is not to be understood that these species are necessarily varieties of those near which they are thus made to stand.

The water can only be driven off at a strong red heat. According to Pisani the arsenic is readUy recognized on heating the mineral in a matrass, \u25a0mixed with carbonate of soda and cyanid of potassium, a ring of metallic arsenic being obtained. He explains the high percentage of vanadic acid obtained by Lasaulx on the ground that he has overlooked the arsenic. Found near Ottrez (Salm Chateau) in the Ardennes, Belgium, with quartz (containing particles of pyrolusite) and albite. Lasaulx first noticed this mineral under the name of mangandisthen, in consequence of a supposed resemblance to cyanite.

R. , lxxvi., 239, 1873), und he concludes that it is merely a variety of breithauptite. An analysis gave him : As 11*5, Sb 48-6, Ni 37-3, Zn 2-4 = 101*5, corresponding to an arseniferous breithauptite. G. = 7'19. It is similar to the mineral from Allemont also described by Berthier (Dana Min. p. 60, anal. 4), which is an antimoniferous niccolite. The name arite, however, may still be well retained for the antimonarsennickel of Petej sen (Pogg., cxxxvii., 396, 1869), the analysis of which agrees very closely with that of Ber thier for the Pyrenees mineral. The mineral described by Petersen occurs massive at the IVenzel mine, Wolfach, Baden, in a coarse granular limestone. It is sometimes accompanied by wolfacbite. An analysis afforded: As 30*06, Sb 28*22, Ni 39*81, Co tr, Fe 0*96, S 1.77 :- 100*82. H = 5*5, G. = 7*50. B.B. fuses with a strong reaction for arsenic and anti mony.

It is mixed with bronzite (after the removal of the iron, troilite and chromite), and con stitutes about one-third of the mixed siliceous minerals. Maskelyne suggests that the rounded character of the mineral and of the accompanying bronzite may be due to this having under gone superficial fusion, or having been softened by the intense heat generated by the rapid course of the meteorite iu the air ; an idea which, he says, seems to be supported by the brit. tleness of the outer portions of the grains.

Nordenskiold has given the name cryoconite to the powder found by him. in Greenland covering the surface of land ice, as also at a distance of 30 miles from the coast. It formed a layer of gray powder, sometimes several millimetres in thickness, and often agglomerated into small round balls of loose consistency. Under the microscope it was seen to consist fo\u00bb"], [934, "14 appendix n. the most part of colorless, crystalline, angular grains ; there were also some organic particles some transparent fragments showing cleavage surfaces (feldspar ?), green crystalline frag ments (augite ?), and black, opaque magnetic particles. An analysis gave G. Lindstrom (1. o.) Si Sl Pe Fe Mn Ca Mg K Na P Cl 62*25 14*93 0*74 4*64 0*07 5*09 3*00 2*02 4*01 0*11 006 water, organic 'matter (ignited at 100\u00b0) = 2*86, hygroscopic water 0*34 = 100*12. Nordenskiold states that the amount of foreign constituents (named above) is very small, so that if the transparent grains all belong to the same mineral, its composition can be de duced from the analysis, the oxygen ratio for R : R : Si = 2 : 3 : 14, and the formula as given by him is 2R Si* + SlSi3+ ft. Its specific gravity was 2 -63 (21\u00b0 C), hardness inconsid erable, and crystalline form monoclinic. The magnetic particles contain metallic iron, with cobalt and probably nickel. In regard to the source of the powder, the conclusion arrived at is that it must either have come from Jan Jlayen, or from some unknown volcanic region in the interior of Greenland, or else it must be of cosmical origin. The oxygen ratio given is a very unlikely one, and there seems to be no sufficient ground for considering the material essentially homogeneous, as claimed by Nordenskiold. The composition is very closely that of an oligoclase-trachyte, so that the cryoconite may be properly, as he calls it, a \" trachytic dust.\" Cryolite, Jlin. p. 126.\u2014 Manufacture of soda from, J.

They seem to form an intermediate step between amorphous matter and true crystals. See Vogelsang, \u2014 Die Krystalliten, Bonn, 1875, this App. p. vi.

If it be a carbonate of alumina, it gives the mineral peculiar interest as being a compound, not surely identified hitherto either in nature (see hovite, Dana Jlin. , p. 709), nor in the la boratory.

Found at San Piero in Campo, Island of Elba, in cavities in the granite, with tourmaline, lepidolite, quartz, feldspar. It occurs, as a secondary product, along with heulandite and stilbite, covering these minerals. A mineral from the same locality, with the foresite of v. Rath, associated in the same way, and similar in physical properties (anal. 2), was referred provisionally by Achiardi (1. c.) to cookeite (cuccheite), although with a question as to the propriety of so doing. It is like cookeite (Brush, Dana's Jlin., 1868, p. 489) in manner of occurrence, but, as mentioned by Achiardi, has a very different chemical composition. (Could a confounding of the relative amounts of Si and Sl have suggested the identity of the Elba mineral with cookeite, viz. : Si 35, Sl 45 (cookeite). Si 45, Sl 36 (foresite).

On im mersion in water breaks to pieces with a sharp crackling sound, the fragments having a conchoidal fracture. Occurs in veins traversing a serpentine rock near Noumea, capital of New Caledonia ; asso ciated with chromic iron and steatite. Liversidge calls attention to the relation of this species to alipite, and suggests at the same time that it is probably a result of decomposition and consequently hardly deserves a new name, proposing, however, in case it prove to exist in large quantities, the name from the locality (i.e., noumeaite). A private contribution from Mr. W. B. Clarke (from whom Jlr. Liversidge obtained his specimen) states that the mineral was discovered by Garnier in 1865, and should properly receive the name garnierite, especially as it was found at Jlont d'Or, before the town of Noumea existed. In the Bull Soc G. , II. , xxiv. , 448 (1867), Garnier in an article onNew Caledonia mentions the occurrence of a hydrous magnesian silicate (=gymnite) in the veins of the serpentine, and adds that it is sometimes colored green through the pre sence of a silicate of nickel (*>'. e., the so-called garnierite ?). It is hence probably a mixture. If an analysis of the similar material by Leibius (Sydney Herald, Sept. 23, 1874) is correct (Si 48*90, Mg 10*93, Ni 6*46, \u00a70*83, *Pe + Sl=15*13, ft=17*75), it would imply an entire want of constancy of composition.

R., lxxiil, 306, 1247) was announced in Appendix [. p. 11, to be identical with amblygonite, the statement being founded upon the results of analyses by Pisani (C. R., lxxiii., 1479) and v. Kobell (Ber. Ak. Miinchen, Feb. 3, 1872) ; it is moreover confirmed by a subsequent analysis by Rammelsberg (Ber. Chem. Ges. Berlin, 1872). Des Cloizeaux, however, has investigated the matter further ( C. R., Ixxv., 114 ; Ixxvi. , 319, 1S73). He has found that, while the original montebrasite is identical with amblygonite, the mineral from Hebron, Me. , differs from the latter in optical character (amblygonite, Saxony p>v; hebronite, Maine, v >/,), and in having a third cleavage surface inclined upon the other two (making 105 together as in amblygonite) at an angle of 135\u00b0-136\u00b0 and 89\u00b0. They differ somewhat moreover in chemical composition (see below). Des Cloizeaux has also identified a mineral agreeing with that from Hebron at Montebras, and upon this ground he proposes to transfer the name montebrasite to this. V. Kobell (L a), on the other hand, considers such a course as likely to lead to great confusion, and proposes, wisely as it seems, to let the name montebrasite drop entirely, and to caU the Hebron mineral, if it be a distinct species, lebronite. In this proposal he is supported by Rammelsberg, ZS. G. Ges. , xxv. , 59, 1873. Analyses of hebronite: 1. G. =301 ; 2. G. =3-029, Pisani, C.

As wUl be seen by comparison with analysis 4. of normal amblygonite, the hebronite differs in containing less fluorine and soda, while it has about 4 p. c. of water. The true nature of the mineral, even if it be a good species, cannot be regarded as satisfactorily settled, as Rammelsberg remarks.

An analysis (1. c.) gave Cu 49-47, S 50*30, loss 0*40 = lOO'OO, which corresponds to tha formula CuS. Completely soluble in water. Effloresces very readily in contact with the air. When pre served in the matrix untouched the crystals will remain two or three days without sensible alteration, but upon being detached, or even touched, they change color almost immediately. In the alteration the crystals first show a blue color, then split to pieces slowly, and separate into minute granules, which seem to be crystals, though too small to allow of their form being determined. The cause of the efflorescence in this case is the absorption of the water from the atmosphere, not the loss of water, as is generally true. The change when complete results in the production of chalcanthite (CuS + 7st). In the prismatic zone the crystals show no immediate relation to allied sulphates ; the angles of the brachydomes., however, agree quite closely, 1-iAl-i = 77\u00b0 6', hydrocyanite ; 75\u00b0 52', celestite; 75\u00b0 35', anglesite ; 74\u00b0 34', barite. Found by Scacchi at Vesuvius, having been produced by sublimation at the time of the eruption of October, 1868.

He also describes two varieties of microscopic inclosures to the presence of which the color is due ; the first be calls microplakite. They form rectangular tabular crystals (a A a = 90\u00b0, a A secondary plane =153 J\u00b0-153\u00b0) and lie in a position perpendicular to that of the augite' needles. By transmitted light they are grayish-yellow to brownish, by reflected light reddish-green to green and blue (the colors of thin media). Schrauf says that in most of their properties they agree with magnetite, though their apparent insolubility is against that idea. The second kind of inclosures he calls microphyllite, they form indistinct crystalline scales, end lie parallel to the direction of the augite crystals ; they are from -05 to -1 mm. in length, and 02 to *04 in breadth; their true nature is doubtful.

In Dana's Jlineralogy, 1868, the names, leucopyrite and lollingite previously used as sy nonyms, were given, leucopyrite to the mineral with the composition FeAs2, and lollingite to the compound Fe2As3 (supposed to include the arsenical pyrites from Lolling, not then known to have been analyzed). It appears, however, that a little earlier, Zepharovich (Verh. Min. Ges. St. Pet. , II. , iii. , 1867) had found the Lolling mineral to have the composition FeAs.., and hence proposed for it the name lollingite, reserving Shepard's name, leucopyrite, for the FesAs3. The names as given by Zepharovich have the priority, and should be received. In another printing from the stereotype plates (6th sub-edition) of Dana's Min. the change will be made. It is to be added, however, that there was no \" confounding of the names\" (Naumann, Jlin., p. 611, 1874) in Dana's Mineralogy. Levynite, Min. p. 431. \u2014 Richmond, Viet., comp., Kenngott, Jahr.

Sci., II., xlviii, 360, 1869 (Jahrb. Jlin., 1874, 611). Both Zirkel (Jlicroscop. Beschaff. der Jlin., 1873, p. 247) and Rosenbusch (Phys. d. JL'n., 1873, p. 213) speak of the mineral in tbe mica of Pennsbury as being hematite. It is diffi cult, however, to see how this view can be reconciled with the investigations of Brush (1. c). He found that the mineral was blackish to smoky-brown in color, and strongly magnetic. It had moreover a black streak. Upon being heated to redness out of contact of the air it re tained its color, but heated with access to the air it became red. It was sometimes, in conse quence of alteration, changed to a bright red or yellow mineral. The red substance had a red streak, the yellow substance an ochre-yellow streak ; the last became red when heated. Prof. Brush concludes that the black mineral is in all probability magnetite, the red mineral is hematite (arising from the oxidation of the original magnetite), and the yellow-ochre min eral is hydrated sesquioxyd of iron, due to hydration as well as oxidation. 189. Magnochromite, Bock, Inaug. Dissert. Breslau, 1869. Websky, ZS. G. Ges., xxv., 394, 1873. A variety of chromite from Grochau, Silesia, containing a large amount of magnesia. It has been previously described by Breithaupt (1832, III., p. 234 ; 1847. Ill, 777). and also by other authors In physical characters it agrees with chromite. except in its want of metallic lustre and low specific gravity. According to Breithaupt G. = 4 031-4*110 (this, Websky suggests, is in part accounted for by the presence of impurities). It occurs in rounded grains embedded in a green gangue from which it cannot be entirely separated. This gangue mineral is considered by Websky as a new species, and using an analysis of it (v grochaui'e) he deducts it from an analysis of a mixture of the two, made by Bock, and obtains the following as the composition of the magnochromite : Sl = 29*92. <5r = 40*78, Fe = 15*30, Mg = 1400 = 100 00.

Maxite resembles leadhillite very closely in its physical characters, especially in its optical properties, and is not far off in composition.

Jlin., 1872, 188) has proposed to give the name r\u0153pperite to the man ganese dolomite, analyzed by R\u0153pper (1. c. ), and the name stirlirigite to the iron-manganese zinc-chrysolite. The latter name cannot stand as it has already been given to the mineral most characteristic of the locality (Franklin, N. Y. ), that is, the red oxyd of zinc (zincite, Dma, but see Jlin. Sth ed., Sth sub. ed., p. 135), Alger. Jlin., p. 565, 18p44, by him incorrectly written sterlingite. Moreover the other mineral being only a sub-variety does not deserve a name. Almost simultaneously with the note of Kenngott, Brush gave the name roepperite to the new chrysolite of R\u0153pper, and there is no question but that this name should be received ; it may be added that it is already accepted by Groth, Tabellarische Uebersicht der Mineralien, etc., p. 52, 1874.

Jlitth., 1874, 137) has investigated it thoroughly, and proved that it is beyond doubt an independent species. According to him its crystalline form is triclinic, a (vert.) : b : c=l*4463 : 1 : 2*2046. The fundamental angles are: f=91\u00b0 0', 17=89\u00b0 26'. \u00a3=90\u00b0 40'. The habit of the crystals is quite varied, but they are especially characterized by their tendency to the formation of twins. All the crystals investigated by Schrauf proved to be twins, in many cases of the most complex nature. But without figures any description of them would be unintelligible. H. =3*5.

The Daniel crystals have a lighter color, corresponding to the smaller percentage of cobalt, and greater amount of lime. When heated at 100\u00b0 C. . the crystals break into fragments, and take a dark-blue color, but resume their red color on cooling. Rosthornite, Hofer, Jahrb.

In the flame of a Bunsen gas-burner becomes milky, colors the flame violet, and melts easily to a colorless (on cooling white) bead, with a crystalline granular texture. In matrass gives off water, decrepitating violently. Easily attacked by water, dissolving in part with the separation of sulphate of lime. Vrba found that one part of syngenite dissolved in 400 pts. of water. Found in cavities in halite at Kalusz, East Galicia.

This Third Appendix to the fifth edition of the System of Mineralogy is designed to make the work complete up to January, 1882. Its publication has been unavoidably delayed long after the date originally set for its completion. The fact that seven years have elapsed since the issue of the Second Appendix (March, 1875), will be a sufficient ex planation of the perhaps inconvenient length to which it extends. This Appendix contains : (1), full descriptions oi* all species announced asnew since the publication of Appendix II. ; and (2), references to all important mineralogical articles which have been published during the same period, with citations from them of many new analyses and new facts as to physical characters and localities. Under each species the entries are, for the most part, arranged under two heads : that of Crystallization (Cryst. ), for the articles which treat of the crystalline form ; and that of Analyses (Anal.), for those containing chemical analyses, with or without other matter. The number of \" new species \" is very large, aggregating fully three hundred (300). Unfortunately the original descriptions of a large part of them are very incomplete, and in too many cases the names are contributions only to the nomenclature of the Science. If two very simple rules could be conscientiously followed by those investigating supposed new species, the Science of Mineralogy would bo vastly benefited. These are : first, that the material analyzed should in every case be proved by a careful microscopic and chemical examination to be homogeneous; and, second, that the thorough investigation which is to establish the position of a \" new species \" should precede, not follow, the giving of a new name. A mineral which can be only partially described does not deserve a name. In the classified list of new names on p. xi, those which seem to have a fair claim to recognition (including the names of some well-characterized varieties) are placed first. Following these in each division, are given -in a paragraph the names, (1), of ordinary varieties having no especially distinctive character ; (2), of imperfectly described or doubt ful species, for which further study is much to be desired ; and (3), of those so-called species which are obviously bad. The names of all species, new and old, are arranged in the body of the work in alphabetical order; the former are printed in black-faced type. References are given both to the System and also to Appendixes I. and II. ; Appendix III. is, consequently, an index for the earlier Appendixes. The Bibliography includes a list of mineralogical works published since January, 1875. To this is added a list of new journals devoted wholly, or in part, to mineralogical sub jects, and also a list of memoirs upon a single subject of more than ordinary importance. For the explanation of Abbreviations, see the System, pp. xxxv.-xlv., and also this Introduction, p. viii. The thanks of the writer are due to Professor George J. Brush for his kindness in reading a set of the proofs as the work was going through the press. New Haven, April 1st, 1882. ui"], [988, ""], [989, "BIBLIOGRAPHY.

V.\u2014 MEMOIRS ON THE \"OPTICAL ANOMALIES\" OF SOME CRYSTALLIZED MINERALS. The question as to the true explanation of the \"optical anomalies \"presented by many crystallized minerals has been widely discussed in the past few years. That the crystals of many species exhibit in polarized light optical phenomena, not in harmony with their apparent geometrical form, has long been recognized ; and the explanations which have been offered in earlier years are well understood: that is, the theory of lamellar polarization of Biot, of internal tension of Reusch, of disturbed molecular structure of Marbach, and so on. Tho recent discussion of this subject has taken a wide range, and many new facts have been recorded. Attention has been especially directed to it by the classical memoir of Mallard, the importance of which cannot be overestimated, even'if his conclu sions are not always accepted (for title see below). According to Mallard's view, as far as"], [993, "BIBLIOGRAPHY. IX it can be explained in a word, these optical anomalies are explained on the assumption that the crystal exhibiting them is in fact made up of separate individuals regularly grouped, which are of a lower grade of symmetry than that which the complete form simulates. Thus, an apparent isometric cube may be made up of 6 square pyramids, each optically uniaxial. placed with their vertices at the centre of the solid, and their bases lorming its sides. Similarly an apparent isometric octahedron may be made up of eight anisotropic triangular pyramid's grouped in an analogous manner; and so on. Mallard thus includes under pseudo-isometric species: alum, analcite, boracite, fluorite, garnet, and senarmontite; among the pseudo-tetragonal species: apophylite, brookite, mellite, octahedrite, rutile, vesuvianite, zircon; among pseudo-hexagonal species: apatite, beryl, corundum, penninite, ripidolite, tourmaline; pseudo-orthorhombic species: harmotome, topaz ; pseudo-monoclinic, orthoclase (microcline). Many additional facts to which the hypothesis of Mallard is appli cable have been published by Bertrand (see below, and under the various species in the body of this work), who has also devised an arrangement of the microscope by means of which, with a high magnifying power, optical investigations may be made in many cases where it was before impossible. Graitarola includes calcite, quartz, nephelite, barite, etc. in the list of species which have an apparent symmetry higher than that which really belongs to them ; his conclusions, however, are not based upon observations. In many other eases observers have, on the basis of variation in angles, or of optical char acters, reached the conclusion that the species in question really belongs to a system of lower symmetry than that to wiiich it has been ordinarily referred. These cases are recorded in Appendixes II. and III. These last named observations, however, do not in most cases admit of being explained on the hypothesis of Mallard. In many of them the conclusions reached are beyond doubt correct, in others the question must be regarded as still undecided. Tschermak proposes the term mimetic for those forms (\" mimetische Formen \"), which imitate a higher grade of symmetry by the grouping (twinning) of individuals of a lower grade of symmetry, as for example, aragonite. Mallard's hypothesis has been opposed by various investigators on the ground that it does not explain many observed facts and is decidedly at variance with others. The observa tions of Klocke, Jannettaz, Klein, Ben Saude, are especially to be mentioned. A few of the facts bearing upon the question are given under boracite (p. 17) and analcite (p. 5). Klocke shows that the same crystal of alum may contain truly isotropic (normal) and aniso tropic (abnormal) portions ; also that the so-called distortion of the crystals and their posi tion during their formation influences tho optical phenomena observed. He shows, also, that preparations of gelatine, hardened under tension, show all the optical phenomena of the crystals under discussion. This subject cannot be elaborated here ; it is enough to say that the observations of the mineralogists mentioned, r.s .ilso of others, seem to confirm the view of Reusch, that at least in many cases (e. g. analcite, garnet, vesuvianite, etc.) the \"optical anomalies \" are to be explained as due to the state of molecular tension existing within the crystal. The investigation of this subject cannot, however, be regarded as entirely completed. A good general review of this subject is given by Zirkel in the llth edition of Naumann's Mineralogy, pp. 152 et seq., also p. 722, 1881.

Crystals from Annerod, near Moss, Norway, gave him 36-58 Si02 and 18-84 P2Os, supporting this view.

The question as to the crystalline system of analcite has been recently discussed, as follows : Schrauf (Anzeig. Ak. Wien, 1876), referred crystals from Friedeck, Bohemia, to the orthorhombic system, describing them as complex twins, analogous to those of leucite described by vom Rath. Mallard (Ann. Min., VII., x., Ill, 1876) describes the optical anomalies of the species, and explains them by assuming that a crystal is formed by the interpenetration of three pseudo-tetragonal individuals, each one of which is formed of two orthorhombic crystals, with nearly equal axes ; these 24 orthorhombic crystals, com posing a single pseudo-isometric crystal, correspond to the 24 planes of a tetrahexahedron. Lasaulx (J. Min., 1878, 510) describes the results of an optical examination of crystals of picranalcite from Monte Catini, Tuscany, and concludes (but see below) that they can be only explained by the assumption that a crystal is made up of 12 triclinic individuals interpenetrating each other, analogous to the compound crystals of phillipsite (q. v.). Schulten (Bull. Soc. Min., iii., 150. 1880) has obtained trapezohedral crystals by artificial means, and on optical grounds claims for them a complex structure, analogous to that assumed by Mallard (see above); with him, however, the crystals are rhombohedral. Crystals obtained later by a different method were isotropic (ib., v., 7, 1882.) On the other hand, later investigations by v. Lasaulx (Z. Kryst., v., 330, 1881) on crystals from the Cyclopean Is., have led him to the conclusion that the optical phenomena are to be explained (as formerly accepted) by reference to the varying degrees of tension existing in the interior of the crystal. Arzruni and Koch (Z. Kryst., v., 483, 1881) have also, after a review of the whole subject, and an extended optical examination of specimens, espe cially from Kerguelen Is. and the Cyclopean Islands, concluded that analcite is to be referred to the isometric system. Finally, the whole subject has been exhaustively reviewed and further investigated by Ben Saude (Inaug. Diss., Stuttgart, 1881, and J. Min., 1882, 1, 41). He describes the results of an optical examination of sections of many crystals cut parallel to the cubic, octahedral, dodecahedral, and trapezohedral (2-2) planes, and shows that they do not correspond with Mallard's hypothesis, but can be explained on the sup position of internal tension. He found, further, that gelatine cast into moulds corre sponding to the crystalline forms acquired on solidifying similar optical characters. Anatase. \u2014 See Octahedrite, p. 85.

Neglecting the silica, the formula calculated by Blomstrand is R2Cb20, + 2 J aq., which makes it nearly identical with samarskite, and also to the less certain nohlite (App. II. , p. 41), except in the water; Brogger, however, shows that the water is not essential, but is due to a partial alteration which is accompanied by a lowering of the hardness (to 4-5) and specific gravity (to 4*28), and a loss of lustre. A crystal with G. = 5-7 showed only a trace of water. The mineral is consequently hardly to bo separated from samarskite in composition, but it is different in form (see E. S. Dana, Am. J. Se, III., xi, 201, 1876). Brogger shows further, that annerodite (euxenite and polycrase) bears the same relation to columbite that samarskite does to tantalite ; the two last being very near in form, as aro annerodite and columbite.

Streng (1. c.) calls attention to the close relation of eleonorite to beraunite from St. Benigna, Bohemia (Min., p. 558). The following are analyses of the original beraunite: 1. Tschermak, Ber. Ak. Wien, xlix., 341, 1864; 2, 3. Boricky, ib., lvi., 11, 1807; 4. Frenzel, from Scheibenberg, Saxony, J. Min., 1873, 23. P.O. Fe,03 H-0 1.

Streng shows that in composition the St. Benigna mineral is nearly identical with eleonorite, but regards the differences in physical characters too great to allow of their being united. The mineral of Frenzel seems to have a different crystalline form. Bertrand (Bull. Soe. Min., iv., 88, 1881), has subjected both thq beraunite and eleonorite to a new examination, and concludes that in angles, dichroism and optical qualities they are the same. There would seem consequently to be little doubt of their identity. Bergamaskite. \u2014 See Amphibole, p. 5. Bernardinite. \u2014 Described as a new fossil resin from San Bernardino, Cal. , by J. M.

Min., VII., x., 148, 1876) describes the optical anomalies observed in crystals of beryl, and concludes that it is pseudo-hexagonal, the individuals of which a crystal is made up being orthorhombic ; the relations are regarded as similar to those in apatite. See also Des Cloizeaux, Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 94, 1881. Atterberg (Geol. For. Forh., ii., 405, 1874) uses the name pseudo-emerald (pseudo smaragd) to designate a mineral resulting from the alteration of beryl. The name was introduced by Berzelius for pseudomorphous crystals, consisting, as he regarded it, of ordinary beryl and mica. Atterberg retains the name for the hard portion of similar pseudomorphs, which, however, he finds to be not true beryl. Its characters are : hard ness 5-5 ; G. = 2-70 ; lustre waxy; color dark grayish green ; fracture splintery. Inti mately mixed with mica scales.

If the water is considered basic, the ratio for bases to silica is 2 : 3. The mineral differs from ordinary beryl in having lost part of its silica and gained potash and water ; the alumina and glucina are sensibly unchanged. Prom Kararfvet, near Fahlun, Sweden. Grattarola (Riv. Scientif.-industr., No. 19, 1880, Florence) has given the name rosterite to a mineral which he regards as a distinct variety of beryl. It occurs in short prismatic to tabular doubly-terminated crystals. Basal plane rounded, and apparently formed of many planes of varying position, belonging to the second series. In polarized light a basal sec tion is divided into six sectors, corresponding to the prismatic edges, for the three alternate of which the extinction is the same.

[The reasons for regarding this as a distinct variety of beryl are : its crystalline habit, its optical character, and the variation in chemical composition. To the first, however, no weight can be given, and as little to the second, since analogous optical anomalies have been previously observed in ordinary beryl ; as to the composition, further careful analy ses are needed to establish that point.] Locality, Island of Elba. Berzeliite, Min., p. 544. \u2014 W. Lindgren (Geol. For Forh., v., 552, 1881) states that the hitherto accepted description of berzeliite is incorrect, in consequence of its having been confounded with another mineral which occurs at Langban, associated with it. The char acters of true berzeliite are : Massive ; isometric (Sjogren, Geol. For. Forh., ii, 533, 1875, and A. Wichmann, Z. Kryst., v., 105, 1880) ; no distinct cleavage. H. =5. G. = 4-07-4*09.

There also occurs at Langban another arsenate, having the following characters : Mass-"], [1013, "15 appendix m. ive ; anisotrope, but crystalline system uncertain ; no distinct cleavage. H. =5.

This mineral is regarded as the one to which the earlier descriptions belong (Min., p. 544), but while optically distinct from berzeliite, their true relation is still very uncertain. [The above observations only increase the doubts as to the true nature of berzeliite ; as possibly bearing upon the question as to the relation of the isotrope and anisotrope min erals mentioned, attention may be called to the fact that Des Cloizeaux has observed iso tropic varieties of gadolinite and also of homilite, supposed to be due to alteration.] See also Caryinite, p. 20.

Boracite, Min., p. 595; App. II. , p. 8. \u2014 The question as to the true explanation of the long recognized \" optical anomalies of boracite has been recently discussed by Mallard, Ann. Min., VII., x., 93, 1876; and Bull. Soc Min., il, 147; E. Geinitz, 3. Min., 1876, 484; 1877, 394; Baumhauer, Z. Kryst., iii, 337, 1879; Klein, J. Min., 1880, ii., 209; 1881, L, 239. Geinitz shows that (contrary to the earlier explanation) unaltered boracite is anisotropic; Mallard makes the species pseudo-isometric, explaining the optical phenomena by the grouping of twelve orthorhombic individuals (as remarked by Klein this hypothesis was proposed by Hartmann in 1826). Baumhauer reaches a conclusion somewhat similar to that of Mallard on tho basis of the results of etching experiments. Klein, however, seems to settle the question conclusively in favor of the true isometric character of the species. He shows, for example, that the interior optical structure does not correspond to the exterior planes; that the distribution of the etching figures does not depend on the interior optical limits ; and further, that upon an increase of temperature the former optical limits dis appear or become indistinct, and that the optical fields change their position without affect ing the form of the etching figures. He concludes that all the optical anomalies can be explained by the internal tension produced in the course of the growth of the crystal. Borax. \u2014 Min., p. 597; App. II. , p. 8.

Schrauf. (Ber. Ak. Wien, lxxiv., 535, 1876), after an extended study of crystals from different localities, concludes that they are all monoclinic and isomorphous with wolframite; he, however, distinguishes among them three types varying in the crystallographic constants (this result was announced earlier, see App. II. , p. 9 ; also J. Min., 1877, 800; 1878, 50). Later (Z. Kryst., L, 274, 1877) he discusses the optical characters of thc species in their relation to the crystalline system.

Occurs intimately mixed with calcite and hausmannite, at Langban, Wermland, Sweden. Named from uapvivoi, nut-brown. Sjogren remarks that berzeliite occurs with caryinite, and sometimes enclosing it. He finds the berzeliite isotropic (isometric), and the caryinite anisotrope (monoclinic '\u2022*), and as the two species have analogous composition, he suggests that the former may have been formed from thc latter (Geol. For. Forh., ii, 533, 1875). Lindgren (ib., v., 556, 1881), however, describes the way in which the minerals occur together, and concludes, for certain cases, that the caryinite is altered into berzeliite. [The genetic relation between caryinite and berzeliite merits further examination.] According to Des Cloizeaux (Bull. Soc. Min. , iv., 56, 1881), the mineral has two cleavages, at an angle of 130\u00b0. 2E = 41\u00b0 58' to 47\u00b0. Dispersion p > v, also horizontal (hence mono clinic).

On treating the graphite from the interior of the meteoric iron of Sevier, Tenn., with tth3r. Smith obtained small quantities of acicular crystals having a peculiar odor, mixed with some small rounded points. These he regards as identical with crystals obtained from the iron of Alais, France (Mar. I.i, 1806), by Roscoe (Proc. Lit. Phil. Soc Manchester, iii,, 57, 1863). Smith has obtained the same crystals from the Alais meteorite. In the closed tube he finds that they fuse at 115\u00b0-120\u00b0, and at a higher temperature the sulphur is sublimed, and a black residue left behind. He regards these crystals as proof of the presence of a sulpho-hydrocarbon, for which he proposes the name celestialite. Roscoe (1. c ) found that 1*94 p. e of the meteorite dissolved in ether, and from the solution he obtained crystals melting at 114\u00b0 C, and in two forms : acicular, which he considered as near to konlite (Min., p. 737), and rhombic, which he identified as free sulphur.

He finds, for example, that a basal section in polarized light shows a composi tion of six differently orientired individuals, of which the extinction directions of two neighboring portions are symmetrically arranged with reference to the line of union. A section parallel to a rhombohedral plane, under tho same conditions, is divided into two parts along the shorter diagonal. Por further details see the original paper (Min. Petr. Mitth., il, 391, 1879), or the abstracts (Z. Kryst., v., 377, and J. Min., 1880, ii., 135). \u25a0Streng (see below) also discusses the same problem, but without arriving at so definite a conclusion. Becke finds gmelinite related in structure to chabazite, while herschelite (q. v.) differs from both, and to the latter levynite is probably related. Des Cloizeaux (Bull. Soc.

Acad., iii., 67-96, 1875 (abstr. in Am. J. Sc, III., x., 89). It has also been proved by the same author, that the crystals of the \"third type \" belong to the monoclinic system (Am. J. Sc, III., xi., 139, 1876). The measured angles alone, however, would not imply any variation from the orthorhombic type, although it has long been observed that the hemihedral development of the planes was in accordance with monoclinic symmetry. The corresponding Vesuvian species, humite, has been studied by Des Cloizeaux (Phil. Mag. III., ii, 286, 1876, and iii., 357, 1877; or see J. Min., 1876, 641 ; 1877, 500) and by Klein (J.

Des Cloizeaux finds the three types of humite to be optically distinct, and proposes to retain for the \" first type,\" which he shows to be orthorhombic, the name humite ; for the \" second type,\" which he finds to be monoclinic, he retains the name chondrodite, and to the \"third type,\" also monoclinic, he gives the name clino humite (the observations on the second and third types confirm those of E. S. Dana od Brewster crystals). Klein (1 c) obtained for third type crystals of humite (clinohumite) re sults agreeing with those of Des Cloizeaux.

Clintonite, Min., p. 508. \u2014 The \"clintonite group\" of minerals have been investigated by Tschermak and Sipocz (Ber. Ak. Wien, lxxviii, Nov., 1878 ; or Z. Kryst., iii., 496). In this group of \" brittle micas \" (Sprodglimmer) the authors include seybertite (clintonite), brandisite, xanthophyllite, also chloritoid, masonite, ottrelite, sismondine, and sapphirine. All of these species belong to the monoclinic system, and in form and physical character thev are closely related to the micas, more especiallv to margarite (see original memoir and P- 77). Chemically, it is assumed that the first three of these minerals arc isomorphous mixtures of H^Ca.jMgpSioOnj and H2CaMgAl,,012 : in seybertite in the ratio of 4 : 5, in brandisite of 3 : 4, in xanthophyllite of 5 : 8. As the two compounds assumed are not known to have an independent existence, the results reached are hypothetical. In order to bring out the relation which is supposed to exist between the micas, margarite, and seybertite, the fol lowing scheme is given, representing the compounds which are assumed to enter into their composition : Mica.

The Northfield mineral had the form and habit of ordinary columbite, though it is essentially a tantalite. This was also true of the Branchville mineral (Brush and Dana, Am. J.

Delafon taine (1. c) found a large proportion of Cb205, about 16 p. c Ta2Os, and possibly a little TiO.,. He states further, that the low specific gravity supposed to be a specific character of this substance is explained by its containing less Ta2Os (Braincrd's columbite contains 37 p. c ), and by the admixture of some foreign material.

In light brown crystals (G. = 5-915) Rammelsberg obtained PbO 54-35, ZnO 20-93. These analyses lead to the formula R4V.03, H20 or R3V20\u201e + RH202 (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1880, 652; and ZS. G. Ges., xxxii, 709, 1880). This formula is analogous to that of libethenite, the form of which, as shown by Des Cloizeaux, is also near that of descloizite. On the other hand, Rammelsberg shows that the analysis of Damour (Min., p. 609) after the de duction of the soluble portion reduces to V205 24*80, PbO 60-40, ZnO 2-25, FeO 1-48, MnO 5-87, CuO 0-99, H.O 2-43, Cl 0-35 = 98'57, and this corresponds to R3V208, H20, with R = (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu) : Pb = 1 : 2.

A vanadate, related to descloizite, has been called brackebuschite by Doring (Ram melsberg, ZS. G. Ges., xxxii., 711, 1880).

Rammelsberg deduces the formula R3 YaO\u00bb + H.O, with Fe : Mn : Pb = 1 : 1 : 4, this gives : V205 25-45, PbO 62-09, FeO 5-01, MnO 4-95, H20 2-50 = 100. Occurs with descloizite and vanadinite, at several localities in the Stato of Cordoba, Argentine Republic. Named for Dr. D. Luis Brackebusch, of Buenos Ayres.

Min., Beil.-Bd., i., 203, 1S81. Schuster (Min. Petr. Mitth., iii., 117, 1880), has carried through a long series of observa tions as to the optical characters of the triclinic feldspars ; and has established the important conclusion that in an optical sense there is the same gradual transition from one extreme (albite1, to the other (anorthite), as is observed in the chemical composition. Thus, he finds that the position of the extinction-directions, as observed on the basal and clinodiagonal planes, the position of the axes of elasticity, the dispersion of the axes, and the axial angle, all show this gradual change in the same direction. These conclusions obviously confirm the now almost universally accepted view of Tschermak, that the intermediate triclinic feld spars (plagioclase) are to be regarded as isomorphous mixtures of albite and anorthite. Mallard (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 96, 1881), has gone further and shown that by means of formulas deduced by him (ib., p. 71), on the view that in isomorphous mixtures (as of albite and anorthite) each element usually enters without change of its own characters, it is possi ble to calculate the direction of extinction for the two planes ( 0 and i-t) : the results of calculation and experiment agree very closely. Experiments by Fouque and Levy (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 63, 1881), on a series of feldspathic microlites intermediate between albito and anorthite, give results at variance with the above conclusions.

His conclusions are supported by Bertrand (Bull. Soc. Min., iv., 12, 13, 1881), who describes more fully the supposed method of grouping of the biaxial elements. For example, a dodecahedral crystal of aplome, according to this view, is made up of 48 biax ial crystals in the form of triangular pyramids meeting at the centre of the dodecahedron ; the bases of four of these pyramids together form a dodecahedral plane The acute negative bisectrix is sensibly normal to the base of the pyramid, and the plane of the axes sensibly parallel to the longer diameter of the rhombic face; the axial angle is about 90\u00b0. Bertrand adds that such a crystal can be mechanically divided into the 48 individuals cor responding to the optical division [but see also p. viii, analcite, p. 5, boracite, p. 17]. Garnierite, App. II. , p. 23. \u2014 It has been shown that, as previously suggested, the sub stance called garnierite is not a definite mineral, but consists of a hydrous magnesian sili cate more or less impregnated with nickel oxide ; the amounts of magnesia and nickel vary widely.

Strassburg, p. 142, 1878). Clarence King, however, describes large tufa-like deposits of calcium carbonate in Nevada, forming beds 20-60 feet thick, and at a height of 470 feet above the present level of Pyramid Lake. These deposits are regarded as the shore formation of an enormous lake, called Lake Lahontan, believed to have existed in quaternary times. This calcium carbonate shows occasionally crystalline forms resembling true gay-lussite, and the whole deposit is believed to have existed origin ally as this mineral. This view is supported by the fact that gay-lussite is now found well crystallized in a lake near Ragtown, Nevada, which is also a remnant of Lake Lahontan. For this pseudomorphous shore deposit King proposes the name of thinolite (from Si'?, shore), Geology of the 40th Parallel, vol. i, 508, 1879.

Min., 1874 679), was called Frenzelite in Append. II. (q. v.). It appears, however, that the same min eral was described in 1873 by V. Fernandez, and named Guanajuatite (La Republica : Periodico oficial del Gobierno del Estado de Guanajuato, July 13) ; the latter name has, con sequently, the priority. Fernandez concludes that the mineral contains only Bi2S3, the sulphur being due, in his opinion, to pyrite. He obtained: Se 35*18, Bi 61*00 gangue 3*70 Pe, S, loss 0*12 = 100. He also gives, H. = 3-5, G. = 6*62; the locality is the Santa Cata rina mine, Sierra de Santa Rosa, near Guanajuato. The same mineral is called castillite by Domeyko, Min. Chili, 3d ed., p. 310, 1879. Mallet has re-examined the mineral, and obtained (Am. J. Sc, III., xv., 294, 1878) : Se S Bi A1_03 Fe203 SiO. H20 31-64 061 59-92 2-53 tr. 347 146 = 9963. After deducting 6-72 p. e halloysite, and 0'56 Si02, present as impurities, the result obtained is : Se 34-33, S 0-66, Bi 65-01 = 100. The formula is then Bi2Se3, with a little of the selenium replaced by sulphur ; the pure mineral contains no zinc The silaonite of V. Fernandez and S. Navia (La Repiiblica, Guanajuato, Mexico, Dec. 25, 1873), is a massive, bluish-gray mineral H. =2-75. G. = 6*43-6*45. Described as having the composition Bi3Se.

These results show that the mineral is essentially the same as that called gumbelite by von Kobell, or a sort of pinite. Genth (Am. Phil.

Completely decomposed by HCI with gelatinization. Found on the Stocko near Brevig, Norway, with meliphanite and erdmannite Named from ouiXe&o, to occur together. Des Cloizeaux remarks that some crystals of homilite are throughout doubly refracting, others are composed of a green doubly refracting kernel surrounded by a yellowish crust of singly refracting material, while still others are entirely singly refracting. In this respect it is closely similar to gadolinite; whether this variation is certainly due to alteration does not appear.

Des Cloizeaux has made a crystallographic and optical examination of hopeite, confirming and extending the results of Levy and Haidinger. Damour shows that it is essentially a zinc phosphate, and Friedel and Sarasin have succeeded in forming artificially crystals which have the form and optical properties of hopeite, and which have the composition Zn3P.O\u201e + 4aq, which requires : P205 3L07, ZnO 53-18, H20 15-75.

The first corresponds with the previously accepted formula : Si4[Al2] CaH\u201e0,5, which, however, expresses the composition of the mineral only after it has lost in dry air, or at 100\u00b0, a part of its water. Smita confirms the conclusion that leonhardite is to be referred to laumontite, differing from it only in having lost a part of the water which goes off at 100\u00b0.

The crystalline form is monoclinic, according to him, with fi = 89\" 48', and the composition is expressed by the empirical formula HioPbls,CjSs05o, which requires S03 8-17, CO, 8-08, PbO 81-91, H20 184 = 100 (seealso J. pr. Ch., xi, 26, 1874; xii, 347, 1876; xiii., 370, 1876). The extremely complex character of the formula makes it somewhat improbable. Bertrand (C. R., Ixxxvi, 348, 1878) describes leadhillite from Matlock, Derbyshire, with 2E = 72\u00b0 yellow (Sardinia and Scotch crystals have 2E = 21\u00b0); the angle diminishes with rise in temperature, aud finally 2E = 66\u00b0 at 250\u00b0 ; above this point the crystals fly to pieces. As bearing upon the question of the independent character of susannite, Bertrand describes crystals from Leadhills, in which he finds gray colored spots with 2E = 21\u00b0, and green colored spots which are uniaxial. The species leadhillite and susannite are prob ably identical. Leidyite. Konig, Proc Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad., 1878, 84.

Mitth., 1876, 66 (anal, by Berwerth); vom Rath, J. Min., 1876, 281, 403; Hirschwald, J. Min., 1876, 519, 733; Baumhauer, Z. Kryst., 1, 257, 1877 ; Hirschwald, Min. Petr. Mitth., 1, 85, 1878 ; Bammhauer, Min. Petr. Mitth., i, 287, 1878 ; Groth, Z. Kryst., v., 264, 1880; Weisbach, J. Min., 1880, i, 143; also Mallard, Ann. Min., VII., x., 79, 1876. Hirschwald maintains that the species is, in fact, isometric, with polysynthetic structure. This view is opposed by Bammhauer, vom Rath, and Groth, and the results of a series of experiments on the etching of the crystalline faces seem to prove its tetragonal nature. Mallard regards leucite as pseudo-isometric, referring it to the orthorhombic system, and later, Weisbach, on the basis of a series of measurements by Treptow, has reached a simi lar conclusion. Fouque and Levy have succeeded in obtaining artificial crystals of leucite (C. R. , lxxxvil , 961, 1S78, and Bull. Soc. Min., iii, 118, 1880); and Hautefeuille (C. R., xc, 313, 378, 1880) has formed an iron leucite, containing iron in place of the alumina. In both cases the same twinning is observed, and the same optical characters as in natural crystals.

The occurrence at Silver Islet, Lake Superior, with the metallic silver, of thin plates and grains of a reddish-brown sectile mineral, containing As, Ag, Co, Ni, and supposed to be new, was described by T. Macfarlane in 1870 (Can. Nat., Feb. 1). To the granular ore, or mixture of reddish-colored grains with other minerals, the name macfar lanite was given, later, by Major Sibley (quoted by Macfarlane, Trans. Amer. Inst. Min. Eng., viii, 236, 1880; see also Courtis, Eng. Min. J., xxvii, March 29, 1879). In 1879 Wurtz described two supposed new minerals from Silver Islet, huntilite (Eng. Min. J., xxvii, 55, 1879) and animikite (ib., p. 124). His descriptions are as follows : Huntilite. \u2014 In two varieties : (A) Of a dark gray or more commonly black color; dull, amorphous, porous, and fragmentary; (B) apparently crystalline; one cleavage direction; bright slate color, and occurs imbedded in calcite.

The author proposes to subtract the Hg as amalgam, and S as pyrite, and then calculat- ii t \u25a0 ing the remaining metals as Ag (R = 2R). he obtains the ratio of R : As ( + Sb) = 2*90 : 1 for A, and 2'99 : 1 for B. On the basis of this, the formula Ag3As is assumed as represent ing the composition. Named after Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. [No value can be attached to the formula deduced (see below), for most of the metals thus taken together are present only as impurities.

Named from \" animikie,\" thunder, whence Thunder Bay. The formula AgaSb is proposed. The complex relations of the above minerals and mineral mixtures has been well investi gated by Macfarlane (1. e ). The granular ore was found to be made up of reddish-brown metallic grains when polished looking like burnished nickel, with an undetermined black mineral niccolite, galena, calcite, and quartz. The ore, pulverized and freed from all brittle materials by washing, yielded 75 to 84 p. c silver; the grains finally obtained by repeated trituration and sifting had a dark gray color, and gave 92 p. c silver; on solution"], [1070, "72 appendix ni. in dilute nitric acid these grains yielded : Ag 93*54, Ni 1-58, As 2 15, Sb 0-36, insol. 2-37 = 100. The insoluble portion (2'37\"p. c) assayed 17-40 p. c silver. A quantity of the original metallic grains were acted upon by three successive portions of very dilute nitric acid.

(quartz, etc), and 3*77 p. c. of a black mineral washed from the quartz, containing 24*8 p. c Ag, also Sb, S, Pb, Co, Ni. The author closes by stat ing very justly, that further investigation is needed to determine the character of tho various minerals present. Konig (Proc Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad., 1877, 276) has analyzed a similar mineral mixture from Silver Islet: As 10-56, Sb tr., S 1-81, PbS 38-18, Ag 32-68, Ni, Co 8 96, Fe 0-35, quartz 0 00, CaC03 1*20=99*74. He regards the nickel and arsenic as combined and forming niccolite, which exists mixed with galenite, argentite, and probably a basic silver arsenide. [It would appear from the above, that the true nature of the individual minerals present in the Silver Islet ores is still to be determined, but that there is probably present a silver arsenide (huntilite), and perhaps also a silver antimonide (animikite) allied to dyscrasite.] Maconite. \u2014 App. II. , p. 36.

[The possible relation of the two substances mentioned is remarked by Brezina (1. c). In any case melanophlogite can hardly be regarded as an original mineral, but more probably as an impure form of silica owing its origin to some method of pseudomorphism. v. Lasaulx thinks it cannot be pseudomorphous after fluorite. The observations of Bertrand would not separate it from the so-called pseudo-isometric species.] Melanosiderite. J. P. Cooke, Amer. Acad.

If the silica is an impurity the composition is exactly that of limonite, as the author remarks; this seems more probable than that it is a true silicate. Locality, Mineral Hill, Delaware Co., Penn. Named from uiXai and diStjpoS, in allusion to the black color. Genth (Second Rep. Min. Pennsylvania, p. 210. 1876), suggests that melanosiderite is only a variety of an iron hydrate, probably a limonite ; Cooke, however, regards it as a basic silicate on tho ground of its vitreous lustre, fusibility, definite composition, and the fact that it gelatinizes with acids.

Lindstrom calls attention to the fact that of the two possible formulas for kentrolite proposed by Damour and vom Rath (see p. 65), the second corresponds exactly to the above composition of melanotekite, viz. : Pb, [Mn2]Si203, which establishes an interesting relation between the two minerals.

Tschermak, on optical grounds (see above), divides biotite into ano*mite (from avouoS, cmtrary to law) and meroxene (Breithaupt's name for the Vesuvian biotite, see Min., p. 307). Anomite is represented by the mica occurring with diopside in granular calcite, at"], [1076, "78 APPENDIX III. Lake Baikal, and that from Greenwood Furnace, N. Y. Its composition, according to Tschermak's view, is expressed by isomorphous mixtures of H2K4AlPlSi80,4 (see muscovite, below), and Mg,,Si\u00ab0,, (a hypothetical polymere of chrysolite), in the relation of 1 : 1, or 2 : 1, or intermediate ratios. Meroxene is represented by the Vesuvian magnesian mica ; com position H3K3AlGSi60,4, andMgi,Si,-,Oi, in the ratio of 1: 1, of 2 : 1, or intermediate ratios. Lepidomelane has the composition H4K,Al0Si60,4, and Mgi,SicO,2, with, however, varying amounts of the iron compound H4K2PeeSi0O24. [In this group would belong the haughton ite of Heddle, and sideropbyllite of Lewis (see below), varieties characterized by the re placement to large extent, of Mg by Fe.] Phlogopite has the composition: K0Al,-,SieO2.p\u201e Hf,Sin,024, and Mg,,Sic024, often in the relation 3:1:4; generally also with P24Si, 0O\u00bb in the place of the second compound. Zinn umldite has the composition : KcAloSic024 (or LicAlcSic024), Fci2Sic024, and F,4ObSiio (or the corresponding hydrogen compound), in the relation of 10 : 2 : 3. The muscovites include lepidolite, muscovite, and paragonite. Lepidolite has the compo sition: 3K6AloSiG0,4 + SiioO,,F24, with the first replaced one-half or more by the corre sponding lithium compound, and the second by the corresponding hydrogen compound (see also Min. Petr. Mitth., ii., 94, 1879). Muscovite (including margarodite): K0AlcSioO,4, with the potassium compound replaced in part by the corresponding hydrogen compound, H0Al6SicO,4; the commonest formula is H4K,Al6Si\u00ab0,4. In certain muscovites, for which the name phengite is proposed, the composition is explained as a combination of H4K,Ala Si60,4, and H6Si10O,4, in the ratio of 3: 1 ; these varieties approach to lepidolite. Paragonite (incl. cossaite), composition : H4Na,AlcSi,-,024. Margarite, composition: H4Ca,Al\u201eSi4024; related to the clintonite group, see p. 28. [For the many important details of the crystallographic relations, and, too, the discus sion upon which the above conclusions as to the composition are based, reference must be made to the original articles.] Analy-ses employed in the above discussion : 1, by John, Lake Baikal ; 2, by P. v.

Wichmann (ZS. G. Ges., xxvi., 701, 1874) uses this name (of Freiesleben) to designate tho original mineral from which the so-called pinite from Stolpen, near Neustadt, has been derived. It is regarded as certain that it is not iolite nor tourmaline, but its true nature is doubtful. Microcline. Des Cloizeaux (Ann. Ch. Phys., V., ix., 433, 1876) uses Breithaupt's name (see Min., p. 355) to designate a new feldspar species established by him : a triclinic potash feldspar. Triclinicand near orthoclase in form, and in habit, twinning, etc., but 0 A i-i = 90\u00b0 16'. Extinction direction makes an angle of 15\u00b0 to 16\u00b0 (orthoclase = 0\u00b0), with the edge O / i-i. Polysynthetic twinning, giving rise to striations on O, sometimes observed. A basal section shows in polarized light a characteristic grating-like structure, due to the regular inter growth of twin lamell\u00e6 ; in these, orthoclase is often enclosed ; irregular lines and bands of albite also often observed.

Cleavage / perfect, O less distinct (as m nepheUte). H. =6. G. =2-444 (Rauff), 2-42-2-.53 (Scacchi). Lustre I brilliant silky. The formula calculated by Rauff is 2 [(CaS04) + 3CaAl2Si.Oe] + [4NaCl + 3Na,Al2Si208] + [Wad + 3K2Al2Si20\u201e], he also makes the rather improbable assumption that a portion of the Si is replaced by C (Si : C = 20 : 1), the formula then requires: Si02 32-68, C02 1-20, A1203 29-33, CaO 10-67, Na20 10-34, K20 6-72, S03 3-81, Cl 6*77 = 101-52, deduet O 1-52 = 100.

Jannettaz has obtained similar results (ib., p. 39), and Jannettaz and Michel (ib., p. 196), have accom panied a more detailed optical study by a scries of analyses which add much to the com pleteness of the investigation.

The specific gravity given in Dana's Min., p. 56, for onofrite (5-56) is incorrect; that num ber belongs to a gray mineral of doubtful character also mentioned by Del Rio (see Brush, 1 c). A mineral partially described by D' Achiardi as a ferriferous variety of guadalcazarite, is provisionally called leviglianite by him.

Rand (ib. , 1880, 274) shows that the coating consists largely of calcite, and after this has been removed by acetic acid, there remain the unattacked tufts of acicular crystals of randite; these, dissolved in hydrochloric acid, yielded largely of calcium and uranium, with a trace of phosphoric acid, alumina, etc. He justly adds, that further investigation is needed to establish the composition of the mineral.

Taking together the acid oxides of columbium (niobium), tantalum, tungsten, tin, and zirconium as M.Os, and reducing all the basic elements to the form RO, and neglecting the water, the ratio RO :M,Os = 221 : 100 is obtained, which corresponds to the formula: R3M2O0 + 4R2M,07. Mallet prefers to include the water, making the hydrogen basic, and deduces on this supposition the formula : R3M20\u00bb. This view, as he shows, is sup ported by the fact that in form sipylite is very near fergusonite. B. B. decrepitates, and glows brilliantly, becomes pale greenish yellow and opaque; in fusible. In the closed tube gives off acid water. With borax in O. P. gives a yellow bead, pale on cooling ; in R. P. assumes a greener tint.

All of these analyses correspond more or less closely to the true formula (Dolter) of the species, viz. : Li2ALSi,i0i, ; note the chromium found by Genth in hiddenite (anal. 8). The variety of spodumene from Alexander Co, N. C. (anal. 7, 8', occurs in prismatic crys tals from 4 inch to 3 inches in length. The crystals are often highly modified, show ing many planes not before observed on the species ; they are often twins ; the forms have been described by E. S. Dana, Am. J. Sc, III, xxii, 179. Perfectly transparent, and color from pale yellowish green to deep emerald green; those of the latter color are highly valued as gems, having a peculiar brilliancy, as compared with the emerald, in consequence of the pleochroism ; the largest stone cut thus far weighs nearly 2\\ carats. They occur in cavities in a gneissoid rock, with emerald (q. v.), quartz, monazite, rutile, mica. The namo hiddenite was given by Smith, after W. -E. Hidden, through whom they have been intro duced as gems, and who has succeeded in finding them in place ; those first found (by J. A. D. Stephenson) were of a pale yellowish-green color, and were obtained loose in the overlying soil. The alteration op spodumene at Goshen and Chesterfield, Mass, has been studied by Julien, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sc, i, 318, 1879 ; that of the Branchville mineral has been investigated by G. J. Brush and E. S. Dana, Am. J. Sc, III, xx, 257, 1880 (or Z. Kryst, v, 192). According to Julien. the Chesterfield crystals are often of immense size, reaching a length of 85 inches, and a diameter of 10 or 11 inches (see above 4, 5, for analyses of unaltered material). Julien describes pseudomorphs after spodumene of cymatolite, of killinite, of muscovite, of albite, of quartz, and of \" vein granite.\" The substance (see below) called cymatolite by Shepard, has a fibrous to wavy structure, silky lustre, white color; H. = 1-5-2: G. = 2-696-2-700. The cymatolite from Goshen was earlier (Eng. Min."], [1111, "APPENDIX m. 113 J, xxii, 217) called aglaite by the same author.

Brush and Dana describe, from Branchville, Ct, pseudomorphs after spodumene, of a substance called fi spodumene (mixture of albite and eucryptite) of cymatolite (mixture of albite and muscovite), of albite, of microcline, of killinite, of \"vein granite.\" The orig inal crystals of spodumene (now mostly altered) were of great size, sometimes 4 feet long, 12 inches wide, and 2 to 4 inches thick. The unaltered spodumene occurring as a core in msmy large crystals is transparent, and either colorless or of a fine amethystine purple ; for analysis see 6, above. The first product of the alteration, resulting from the exchange of Na for one-half the Li, is a substance called fi spodumene. It is compact, apparently homogeneous, with an indistinct fibrous to columnar structure. H. = 5-5-6. G. = 2*644-2*649. Color white, milky, or greenish white. Translucent. Fusibility, 2-25. Three analyses on material from different crystals gave nearly identical results. It is decomposed by HCI into two portions, one soluble and the other insoluble. Analyses by Penfield : 1, of the original material; 2, the soluble portion (32*10 p. c, calculated to 100); 3, insoluble portion (67-56 p. c, calculated to 100) : Si02 A1203 Li20 Na20 K20 ign. 1. fi spodumene (i) 61-51 26-56 3-50 8-14 0-15 0-29 = 100-15. 2. Soluble part 48-13 40-50 10-90 .... 0-47 .... = 100. 3. Insoluble part 68-18 20-07 .... 11 '75 = 100. The whole has the composition (Li,Na)2Al_Si,012, or Li_Al2Si_08 -l- Na2Al2Si6016. The insoluble part is albite (Na_Al._Si\u201e0_.); tho soluble portion is a new mineral called eueryptite (ev, well, upvnxai, concealed), and has tho composition Li2Al2 Si\u00bb0_. Examined under the microscope in thin sec tions (1) parallel to fibres, the irregular interlacing fibres of eueryptite are seen imbedded in albite; (2) transverse to fibres, the eueryptite forms bands with hexagonal outline (see figure), surrounded by albite, like quartz in a \" graphic granite.\" See also Eueryp tite, p. 44. The second stage in the alteration is cymatolite ; it results from fi spodumene, by the exchange of K for the remaining Li, that is, the change of eueryptite to muscovite. The cvmatolite has a fibrous or wavy structure. G. = 2- 092-2 699 ; color white or slightly pinkish. Two analyses by Penfield, of independent specimens, gave essentially identical results; one of these is: Si02 A1203 MnO Na20 K20 Li20 H20 (2) 60*55 26-38 0*07 812 3-34 0-17 165 = 100-28. 8"], [1112, "114 APPENDIX HI. This corresponds to: (Na,K,H)2Al.Si.O._, or (K,H)2Al_Si206 + Na2Al2SioO10. The microscopic examination shows that cymatolite is not, as previously assumed, a simple mineral, but, corresponding to the formula, a very uniform me chanical mixture of muscovite and albite. In some sections the transitions from fi spodumene to cymatolite, i. e. , from eueryp tite to muscovite, are clearly seen. In other cases the muscovite and albite have each segregated together, so that they are dis tinct. For example, in the figure, s \u2014 unaltered spodumene, fi =fi spodumene, c = cymatolite, g \u2014 mica, a = albite. As further steps in the alteration there result : albite, often fibrous, like ft spodumene, also muscovite, and granular micro cline. Still again pseudomorphs occur of killinite. This often retains the structure of the spodumene. The color is light bluish green, to oil green and dark grass green.

From the mines of Carpa and Llaccha (above anal. ), district of Recuay, Peru. Another mineral, near tetrahedrite, is called frigidite by A . D~ Achiardi.

Occurs filling cavities and crevices at the Bjelke mine, near Aareskuta, Jemtland, Sweden ; at first soft, but hardens on exposure to the air. A fine fibrous chalk-white mineral occurs with it, and is regarded as a decomposition product; H. = 1 -5-2-5. Composition: SiO. 11-85, CO, 6-86, S03 13*31, CaO 25*74, A1.03(Fe,03) 2-58. Named from SavjuaZoo, to be surprised, in allusion to the remarkable composition. Tornebohm (quoted by Lindstrom) states that the material analyzed was homogeneous under the microscope, having a fibrous structure. Bertrand (Bull. Soc Min, iii, 159; iv, 8) states that he identified calcite, gypsum, and a third mineral, probably wollastonite, in thaumasite, and hence regards it as a mixture ; he states that chemical trials by Damour confirm this conclusion. Nordenskiold, however (Geol. For. Forh, v, 270, 1880), claims that Bertrand's observations were not made on the pure mineral, and that the mixture pro posed would not have the above composition. Finally, Cohen confirms by microscopic examination the essentially homogeneous (J. Min, 1881, ii, 21 res.) appearance; he sepa rated some gypsum and a carbonate soluble in acetic acid, but does not regard the matter as settled. A further critical examination is needed, in view of the seemingly very improb able composition deduced. Thenaedite, Min, p. 615. \u2014 Province of Arequipa, Peru, Raimondi, Min.

Occurs at Branchville, Fairfield Co, Conn, intimately associated with eosphorite, dickin sonite, lithiophilite, and other species, in a vein of albitic granite. In crystalline form triploidite is very similar to wagnerite, and as the formulas of the latter species and of trip lite are closely analogous (R3P2Os + RF.), it is concluded that the three species are isomor- Ehous; in triploidite, the hydroxyl (OH) takes the place of the fluorine.
