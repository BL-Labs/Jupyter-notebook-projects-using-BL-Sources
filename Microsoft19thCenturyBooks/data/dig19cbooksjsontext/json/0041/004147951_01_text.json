A NEW edition of this book having been called for after the lapse of more than five years from the date of its first appearance, I have found myself in some difficulty as to the matter. In the course of five years many things happen in South Africa, and re marks which applied to a certain anterior condition of affairs necessarily lose most of their freshness and some of their weight. It would not be convenient to rewrite the book, for to do so would be to destroy whatever value it may possess as a contemporaneous historical record. It appears, therefore, that the only suitable course is to add an introduction, or rather a brief summary, of such important events as have occurred between 1882 and the present date. Prophecy is a dangerous thing. Probably there are few writers who could turn after a lapse of years to a political history dealing with interests so various as those with which we are confronted in South Africa, without a secret fear that somewhere in its pages they would find their sage predictions utterly confounded"], [16, "INTRODUCTION. XII by the development of events. I confess that such a fear was present to my mind. It is therefore with some relief and yet with sorrow that I find it to be in the main unfounded. In some cases, as in that of Zululand, the clouds to which I pointed have burst ; in some, as in that of Natal, they still gather and darken.1 On one point, however, I have fallen into signal error. I predicted, as can be seen by reference, that financial ruin would overtake the Transvaal. This has not happened ; on the contrary, the country is very prosperous. The reason of this prosperity is not far to seek, though I failed to foresee it. The vast gold-fields of the Transvaal have been opened up, and its coffers are being filled to overflowing by the enterprise of the diggers. On the other hand, a chance remark that I made in connection with this country has been signally verified. I suggested that a close parallel existed between the case of the Transvaal and that of Ireland, and that the state of affairs which was held to justify the surrender of the one country might equally well be advanced in excuse of the sur render of the other. But here also I made a mistake. After driving my parallel \u2014 which was, I remember, 1 As I have pointed out in my chapter on \" Natal and Responsible Government,\" there seems to be only one possible solution of the native question in that colony, namely, the removal of the natives to Zulu land. Since that chapter was written, however, a considerable portion of the best and most fertile country in Zululand has been seized by the Boers, and as the Zulu people must live somewhere themselves, there is naturally less room left in which to try the experiment of trans planting the native hordes of Natal."], [17, "INTRODUCTION. XIII treated with contempt, not to say contumely, in some quarters \u2014 as far as I conveniently could, I remarked that it must break down at last, because \" it mattered little to England whether or no she let the Transvaal go, but to let Ireland go would be more than even Mr. Gladstone dare attempt.\" So I thought in 1882, in common with most Englishmen. In 1888 ex perience has shown how gratuitous was any such assumption. In concluding my chapter on Zulu history and affairs, which was written just before Cetywayo's visit to England, I said : \" On the whole, I am of opinion that the Government that replaces Cetywayo on the throne of his fathers will undertake a very grave responsibility, and must be prepared to deal with many resulting complications.\" That the responsibility was grave indeed the following pages will show. It will be remembered that on the conclusion of the Zulu war, Sir Garnet Wolseley, acting no doubt under instructions, settled Zululand in a fashion that did not commend itself to the common sense or ideas of justice of most people acquainted with the circum stances. In the place of one king he set up thirteen, who, of course, did not altogether agree. No sooner, however, was this settlement announced than a strong, and in some ways a natural agitation sprang up against it. As it became more and more clear to the English mind how ill-judged, I might almost say how unjust, was the Zulu war, this agitation gathered"], [18, "XIV INTRODUCTION. strength, and with singular unreason took the form of a demand for the restoration of Cetywayo. Now, whatever personal sympathy one may have with the late king, there is no doubt that he was in a degree doubly an offender. He was an offender against the Imperial Power in that he had not kept the promises which he solemnly entered into at the time of his coronation, and he was a much deeper offender against his own people, whom he had ruled with considerable cruelty. Therefore the war against him could to some extent be justified ; whereas the war against the Zulu people, who were never other than our friends, admits of no possible justification. Sir Bartle Frere recognised this when he declared that he made war on Cetywayo, not on Zululand. If, then, we could in any way be held to owe reparation to Cetywayo, how much greater was the reparation that we owed to his unfortunate people, which could, of course, have been fully made by extending the blessings of British rule over Zulu land. But the agitation never took this form, at least not in England. Nobody thought about the Zulus, while everybody's voice was raised on behalf of the dethroned king. A monarch, black or white, is an interesting person, especially when he appears in the streets of London ; but his war-smitten people, mourn ing their dead, seven thousand miles away, do not appeal so actively to the imagination. \" The Zulu people,\" says Sir Henry Bulwer, on 25th August 1882, in his exhaustive and most valuable report on the"], [19, "INTRODUCTION. XV settlement of the Zulu country,1 \" there is little doubt, would have gladly come under the direct rule of the British Government. They would have accepted that rule without question and without misgiving. They would have accepted it for all reasons, not only because it was the rule of the Government that had conquered them, but because they knew it to be a just and merciful rule. . . . ' The Government conquered us (they say) ; we belong to the Government.' \" And again 2 he says : \" Great numbers of the Zulu people have no wish to return under his (Cetywayo's) rule, and would regard any obligation to do so as one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall them.\" These considerations, however, were not allowed to weigh with Her Majesty's Government. In spite of the Wolseley settlement, to which, such as it was, we had solemnly pledged ourselves ; in spite of the cautious but none the less marked disapproval of Sir Henry Bulwer, and of the outspoken protests of the entire white population of Natal (the ex-king's friends and agents alone excepted), it was determined to restore Cetywayo. In vain did Sir Garnet Wolseley write to the Colonial office 3 to place on record his \" strong conviction that the return of Cetywayo to Zululand would be fraught with considerable danger to Natal, and would give rise to serious trouble and bloodshed in Zululand itself, whilst it would be in direct con- 1 [C. 3466], 18S3, p. 139- \" [C- 34*36], p. 199- 3 Ibid. 1883, p. 1."], [20, "INTRODUCTION. XVI travention of the guarantee that I gave to all the thirteen existing chiefs of Zululand, viz., that under no circumstances should Cetywayo be ever allowed to settle again in the country.\" In vain did he on a subsequent occasion 1 feel bound to state that Mr. Dunn \" would not have accepted the position of Chief had I not, as Her Majesty's High Commissioner, given him a promise in the name of the Government of England that under no circumstances should Cetywayo be ever allowed to return to Zululand, a promise approved of by the Government of the day.\" It is, by the way, impossible not to sympathise with Sir Garnet Wolseley, for this is the second occasion upon which promises solemnly uttered by him in the name of the Queen and by order of the British Government were within a few years deliberately set aside. Eor the other instance I refer to his famous proclamation in which he announced, on behalf of the Queen, that the Trans vaal should continue a British possession for ever. It is dangerous to make promises on behalf of a country governed by party. All these protests, together with those of a multi tude of smaller folk, went by Lord Kimberley like the wind. Acting on the sacred principle that agitation must be acceded to, he determined to restore Cetywayo. Even the request of the Transvaal Government, made as usual \" in the interests of humanity,\" that the ex-king should be re-established, did not put him on his guard. 1 [C. 3466], 1883, p. 269."], [21, "INTRODUCTION. XVII But it was found impossible, with the best will in the world, to re-establish Cetywayo in the position of sole Zulu king, which he held before the war. As Sir Henry Bulwer pointed out in various despatches, out of the thirteen chiefs established under the Wolseley settlement only five showed any disposition to welcome their departed king. It therefore became necessary to reserve some territory, where the dis sentients could take refuge. Lord Kimberley did not like this. Indeed he positively refused to allow any part of Zululand to be annexed to the Empire or to Natal,1 but, taking refuge in one of those half measures that have done so much harm in South Africa, stated, characteristically enough, that Her Majesty's Govern ment \" would not object to such arrangements for the control of chiefs by a Commissioner as you (Sir Henry Bulwer) might consider indispensable for the peace and security of that part of the country not placed under the rule of Cetywayo.\" Sir Henry Bulwer pro posed a boundary to this Eeserved Territory, which finally came under English protection for native pur poses only, though nominally in so vague a fashion that it is not possible to define its status with reference to the Empire. This boundary was, however, rejected as taking too much territory from Cetywayo. A narrower one was then proposed, including the terri tories of Hlubi and John Dunn, and cutting off about a fourth part of Zululand from its southern side where it \" [C. 3466], p. 91. b"], [22, "XVIII INTRODUCTION. marches on Natal. This line was ultimately accepted, and the country so cut off became a most successful and self-supporting native state, under the direct rule of Mr. Osborn, who took his orders from the Governor of Natal. Another portion in the north of Zululand, of about half the area of the Eeserved Territory, was set apart for the occupation of the chief, Usibepu, who alone of the kinglets now remained in an independent position. Usibepu is a cousin of Cetywayo's, and the hereditary chief of the Manhlagasi tribe. Of all the Zulu chiefs living at the date of which I write he was recognised to be the best. Sir Henry Bulwer speaks of him as \" a man of considerable force of character, moderate in counsels, strong in action, straightforward in his con duct, courageous, self-reliant,\" nor does his subsequent history belie this report. He was against the Zulu war, but when it had been undertaken fought loyally for Cetywayo. By his people he was beloved, and it was said of him that in his country \" men live to be old.\" But not unnaturally he did not wish to see Cetywayo back, and on the whole it was thought best to leave him in an independent position. Indeed any other course would have been difficult if not impossible. Cetywayo was thus to be restored to about two thirds of Zululand. Moreover, he was to be restored under conditions \u2014 on paper. By these conditions, as assented to by him in his days of captivity, he was made to promise to do many things excellent in them selves and conducive to the good government and"], [23, "INTRODUCTION. XIX prosperity of his country. Amongst others, he solemnly undertook not to make treaties or war with anybody without the consent of the British Govern ment, and to refer all disputes to its arbitration. Of course he never adhered to a single one of these nicely written conditions, and in all probability never intended to adhere to them any more than he did to his corona tion promises. The ignorance of human nature shown by those who imagined that he would is really astonishing. Could they indeed have believed that a savage king, finding himself in his own country, but shorn of a third of his territories and more than half his royal prerogative, would bear upon his heart so vivid an impression of long conditions read to him by a gentleman in a frock coat in Downing Street, to which pressure of circumstances had brought him to assent with an unwilling mind, that he would on their account refrain from doing those things that a Zulu so placed is accustomed to do ? The notion is ridiculous, how ridiculous the issue shows most clearly. When in Zululand paper alone stands between an assegai and an enemy, woe to th'e enemy \u2014 assegais cut paper ! Of course this half restoration did not satisfy Cetywayo's friends, more especially his white friends, any more than it satisfied the king himself. However, it was in January 1883 duly and ably carried out by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, not without some risk to himself and his party. Sir Theophilus's report 1 of \u00bb [C. 3616], 1SS3, p. 40."], [24, "INTRODUCTION. XX his journey and the final ceremony is most interesting reading, and shows two things very conclusively, first, that Cetywayo, even before he was reinstalled, had made up his mind to break the conditions he had promised to obey; and secondly, that the great bulk of the nation was by no means enthusiastic about his return. Thus on the very day of his landing at Port Durnford, for it had not been thought advisable to bring him through Natal, the king sent a message to the Zulu people desiring them to meet and welcome him, and \" to disregard the alleged curtailment of his territory . . . that it was only a Natal device, which he would defeat.\" The Zulus could not at all under stand our conduct in restoring Cetywayo, and were loud in praise of its magnanimity, although they were for the most part more than doubtful as to its results. They called it \" a marvel, a miracle, the raising to life of a man on whose grave for years the grass had grown ; clothing dry bones with living flesh.\" Cety wayo himself, however, began to grow anxious \u2014 his welcome even at the hands of his own Usutu party was not quite all that he had hoped for. A presage of his fate seems to have oppressed him.1 He talked of Sikukuni, who was restored to his people and instantly murdered. Then with singular insight into our ways, he said that \" should assassination be his fate, the British Government would do nothing beyond 1 There is little doubt that Cetywayo perished by poison and not by heart disease, as was at first believed."], [25, "INTRODUCTION. XXI expressing regret and asking for information, and by the time information was forthcoming it would be found inconvenient to do anything in the matter, and so the assassin would go free, and his fate be un avenged.\" These things indeed came to pass. Some chiefs, as in the case of Umfanawendhlela, Cetywayo's uncle, were bold enough to express their open dislike of the restoration. Usibepu came in, not to greet Cetywayo, of whom it will be remembered he was independent, but to pay his respects to Sir T. Shepstone and Mr. Osborn. As he rode past Cety wayo's camp he was received with taunts and threats, which were soon to be translated into acts. Before he went he told Sir Theophilus that he wanted to interfere with nobody, but that if the Usutu attacked him he should defend himself, and he was as good as his word. At length the restoration was carried out, and Sir Theophilus and his escort returned to Natal, leaving Mr. Fynn in the thankless position of Eesident and general adviser to Cetywayo. This was done in January 18S3. Hardly had the echoes of Sir T. Shepstone's words died away, when preparations for the destruction of Usibepu began to be made, if not by Cetywayo's direct orders, most certainly with his cognisance. On the 30th March a force of about five thousand Usutus, acting on the orders, of Undabuko, Cetywayo's brother, made an unprovoked attack upon Usibepu's territory, burnt"], [26, "INTRODUCTION. XXII two of his kraals, and finally met with a crushing defeat at the hands of that chief himself, in which great numbers of the assailants perished. This was the beginning of the end. Undeterred by his repulse, Cetywayo set to work to gather a fresh force to operate, it was said, against Uhamu. In May these forces came into action without decisive results. Much bloodshed, however, took place both on the side of Cetywayo and that of Uhamu. These and other distressing incidents were of course duly reported to Lord Derby, who was much grieved at the \" continued disregard by Cetywayo of the conditions of his restora tion.\" Lord Derby seems to have felt some perplexity as to what argument would have most weight with the intractable king. At length, however, he found one.1 \" You will add,\" he says in his despatch to Sir Henry Bulwer of the 12th July 1883, \"that if he (Cetywayo) continues to disregard his undertakings and promises, it will become a serious question whether Her Majesty's Government should not take the step of withdrawing the British Besident from him!' No doubt when this dreadful threat reached Cetywayo's ears he was duly impressed. Unfortu nately, however, the British Eesident had some months before, on the plea of ill health, sent in his resigna tion of a post which had become unendurable.2 1 [C. 3705], iS83,p. nS. 2 Mr. Fynn did not, however, actually leave Zululand till after Cetywayo's death."], [27, "INTRODUCTION. XXIII Cetywayo meanwhile was daily growing more difficult to deal with. Thus in June we find him repudiating the boundaries assigned to him and claim ing the whole of Zululand. Towards the natives in the Eeserve Territory he assumed a threatening atti tude, ordering them to come and fight for him in the various conflicts wherein he was from week to week enframed. Up to this time there were three main factors in Zulu affairs. I. The English Government, as repre sented by Mr. Osborn and the Eeserve Territory ; 2. Cetywayo ; 3. Usibepu. Now, however, a fourth appeared, the Boer freebooters. When natives are engaged in warfare these men gather and sit like vul tures round a sick ox, awaiting the right moment to develop their plan of campaign. Sooner or later one of the contending parties applies to them for assist ance, nor do they turn a deaf ear to its pleading. Only certain little formalities have first to be attended to. The signature of the chief and a few of his headmen is required to a paper, which, as the signa tories may or may not understand, cedes the greater part of their territory to their kind allies in return for the services they are willing to render \" in the name of humanity.\" These preliminaries arranged, the enemy is attacked, and by the help of the Boer rifles utterly destroyed.

Government can be induced to interfere. The natives find that they have paid for their folly with their country, and that the price of their triumph over the enemy of an hour is their utter national ruin and destruction. The first appearance of the Boers in the present case is reported by Uhamu to Sir Henry Bulwer on 7th July 1883, when, according to his account,1 an Impi of Umdeta's with ten Boers attacked his people residing out of the Transvaal line and \" killed all his people there, as well as their wives and children.\" Mr. Meek, a resident in the Derby District of the Transvaal, also reports \" what appears from the dates to be the same attack, though it is difficult to be sure of this, as no mention is made of the presence of Boers. This attack on the Sicini Mountains, where Uhamu's people had taken refuge, was carried out in the name of Cetywayo, and with every circumstance of barbarity. The assailants were repulsed five times, on the sixth they effected an entrance. Nearly every body was slaughtered. \" They left several companies,\" says Mr. Meek, \"to destroy all remaining life . . . women are lying there with their infants bound to their backs, stabbed right through both their bodies, some with their heads smashed, and others most brutally mutilated. The caves which they did not enter they rammed grass and rubbish into, and then set it on fire, and by so doing burnt and suffocated 1 [C. 3S64], 1S84, p. 55. ,L * Ibid. p. 85."], [29, "INTRODUCTION. XXV many to death. At the entrance lay fifty-two dead men, and five brothers lay dead in a heap, making a total of fifty-seven, all within a few paces, and several women not far from them lay behind the stones with their children on their backs, ripped open. ... I can mention the names of no less than twelve women, eleven girls, and five infants which lay close to one cave, all well known, let alone the remaining numbers that lay on the Sicini Mountain. I should say at a rough estimation there are about 350 lying for the vultures, and for only one reason, viz., ' cattle,' ' cattle,' ' cattle.' \" In short the restoration policy now began to bear fruit. No wonder that Lord Derby threatened to with draw the British Eesident from Cetywayo ! By way of comment on this heroic scheme it may, however, be mentioned that as Her Majesty's Government very well knew, all slaughter could have been stopped, and Zululand reduced to an almost immediate state of quietude by the simple expedient of extending the authority of the Queen over the country. This, how ever, would have involved \" responsibility.\" Of course the piled-up slaughters of thousands of unoffending human beings did not do this, at any rate not in a sense that was likely to find expression at the English polling-booths. And yet we have heard of \"blood guiltiness.\" At length, on the 2 1 st July 1883, the war between Cetywayo and the Usutu party against Usibepu, a"], [30, "XXVI INTRODUCTION. war entirely unprovoked by the latter, came to an issue. Cetywayo was gathering the Usutu for an attack upon Usibepu, when by a sudden and brilliant move that chief entirely out-generalled him. Avoid ing the main body of the Usutu impi, he made a forced march, and about eight on the morning of the 2 1 st hurled himself upon Cetywayo's camp at Ulundi. Cetywayo had about 5000 men with him, and these moved out to meet the attack. But they could not stand before the fierce charge of the Manhlagazi. They broke, scattered, and fled, and after them streamed the pursuers. Soon Ulundi was in flames, and here perished six of Cetywayo's wives and his little son. Here also, among hundreds of others, fell the two chiefs, Seketwayo and Chingwayo, Haiana, Usibepu's own brother, who was bitterly opposed to him, and the Indunas, Sirayo, Umkosana, and Umwumandaba. At first it was believed that Cetywayo himself was among the slain, but this was not the case. He was discovered hiding in a bush, and two young men of the attacking party threw assegais at him, wounding him twice in the thigh. He then called out that he was the king, and the young men left him, whereon he made goood his escape, finally reaching the Eeserve Territory, where he took refuge in a kloof near the Inkankla forest. Here, on the 16th August, Mr. Osborn went in search of him, but finding that he 1 was being surrounded by armed men, fell back, and sent a message to him telling him that he had"], [31, "INTRODUCTION. XXVII come to protect him and to escort him to Eshowe. Cetywayo's reply was couched in a very unsatisfactory and overbearing tone. He said that the whole country belonged to him, that it was all given to him in England, and intimated that he meant to go on in his own way. Finally, on the 15 th October, recognising that circumstances were too strong for him, Cetywayo consented to go \"into Mr. Osborn's armpit,\" or in other words, to accept his protection, and was escorted to Eshowe by Mr. Fynn, who, though he had resigned his position as Eesident, had not yet left Zululand. Here, at Eshowe, the king remained till he died, nominally of heart disease. Meanwhile this state of affairs was not unnaturally viewed with great anxiety by Sir Henry Bulwer. On the 1 6th November we find him writing and telegraph ing to Lord Derby,1 submitting various alternative plans for the settlement of Zululand, pointing out Cetywayo's violation of the conditions of his restoration, and stating that he sees \"no hope of peace or order being maintained in the country unless Cetywayo is removed.\" Among other things he suggests the extension of the Eeserve Territory, to which Lord Derby replies in much haste that it is \" impossible.\" On the 24th November Lord Derby telegraphs again complaining that he has no means of ascertaining \" what party was the strongest.\" Evidently in its despair the Home Government was coming to the conclusion that force was a remedy 1 [C. 3864], 1884, p. 224."], [32, "XXVIII INTRODUCTION. and that first principles must be allowed to assert themselves. Meanwhile the Boers, who proved to be \"the strongest \" in the end, were beginning to creep into Zululand. * The High Commissioner for South Africa directed Mr. Hudson, the British President at Pretoria, to remonstrate with the Government of the Transvaal as to this encroachment of Dutch burghers upon j Zulu territory. The answer of the Boer Government 2 ijk was very plain, and quite in accordance with ifti\u00c6 traditions. The Boers, they said, were entering TyxUi\u00c6s land without authority, \" thus the Government camlet interfere at all in the matter in question.\" In s-T-n/fing such an answer it knew well that it was dealing' with a power that^would hold its band at remonstrance. HaTd upon this ominous occurrence followed another great event. On the afternoon of the 8 th of February 1884, Mr. Osborn was summoned by a messenger who informed him that Cetywayo was very ill. He fetched Dr. Harvie Scott, the senior medical officer of the troops stationed in the Eeserve, and together they went to the Jazi kraal, where the king was. Before they arrived they heard that he was dead. Entering they found the corpse of Cetywayo stretched upon a bed and already nearly cold. The doctor wished to hold a post mortem ; it was not allowed by the relatives. So he certified that \" it is probable that Cetywayo died from ' syncope, the result of disease 1 [C. 3864I, 18S4, Pp. 313-316. 2 [C. 4037], 1SS4, P. 4."], [33, "INTRODUCTION. XXIX \\>i the heart.' \" What is still more probable, however, is that he died from the results of poison administered by nobody knows who. Cetywayo was played out, he was no longer serviceable to the Usutu party, and when tyrants cease to be useful and lose their power there are always among their followers men who do not. .shrink from robbing them of life. Or an open enemy -may have done this thing. There is no medical testimony one way or the other. The cleverest doctor in the world cannot in such a case say with certainty what a man died of unless he examines the body, and nobody ever heard that Cetywayo suffered from heart disease. Another suspicious circumstance is that Mr. Osborn, although he was quite close at hand, was not summoned till the king had been dead for some time. He states that his hands were already cold and his body nearly so. Altogether it is my firm belief, \"athered from information which I have received, that Cetywayo died by poison, a fact which I believe is not now disputed by those who are in the best posi tion to know the truth. And so Cetywayo, child of Panda, passed from the stage. He was a man of some virtues and many faults, who inherited much of his great uncle Chaka's ferocity without his genius. For his breach of the conditions under which he was reinstated in Zululand I for one am not inclined to blame him overmuch, but rather the Government which was weak enough to suppose that a savage potentate would adhere to"], [34, "INTRODUCTION. XXX such conditions. Cetywayo was unfortunate in many things, but in nothing; was he so unfortunate as in his friends and advisers. Had it not been for these meddlesome people, who either from misplaced sym pathy and enthusiasm, or from a desire for notoriety, or in order to thwart the Government of Natal, con tinually encouraged him to fresh acts of folly, it is possible that his history might have had a different end. It is possible that he might then have con sented to be guided by his proper advisers, Sir Henry Bulwer, Mr. Osborn, and Mr. Fynn, and to forego the schemes of aggrandisement that ended in his ruin. But it is useless to discuss possibilities. So died the last king of Zululand. Cetywayo's death did not stay the progress of hos tilities. He was gone, but Dinizulu, his son, remained, and it was, apparently without foundation, put about by the Usutu chiefs that Cetywayo had specially nomi nated him to be his successor. Accordingly, the war against Usibepu was carried on. But the Usutu party was now not strong enough to deal with Usibepu alone. He had out-generalled them and twice signally defeated them. Therefore in their rage and hate they cast round for a means of destruction and found it in the Boers. The Boers were ready to take up arms ; indeed, according to their proclamation of 1 6th August 1S84,1 they deemed it \"a holy duty to accede to the appeals of the Zulu chiefs, in the interests of humanity 1 [C. 4214], 1884, p. 85."], [35, "INTRODUCTION. XXXI and civilisation.\" In pursuance of this holy duty they next, according to their own account, entered Zululand some hundreds strong, crowned Dinizulu, Ceytwayo's son, king, attacked Usibepu and destroyed his people, and in pursuance of a certain agreement of 23d May 1884, took as their reward over three million acres of land, or somewhere about half of the Zulu country. Of course these shameful procedings did not escape the observation of Sir Henry Bulwer. After Cety wayo's death he earnestly pressed upon Lord Derby the necessity of extending our authority in Zululand, but without the smallest result. Lord Derby, speaking in the name of the Government, absolutely refused to do anything. \" Her Majesty's Government,\" he tele graphs on the 1 6th May, \" adhere to the decision not to extend British sovereignty or protection over Zulu land.\" Meanwhile the Usutu party, growing more bold, commenced to molest the Reserve Zulus. Mr. Osborn remonstrated and in vain. The upshot of it was that early in the morning of the 10th May his camp was attacked by about 10,000 Usutus, whom he repulsed with a loss of a hundred men. On the Sth of the same month, just before this event, Sir Henry Bulwer, realising the extraordinary gravity of the situation, telegraphed urgently to Lord Derby.1 \" If we allow Boers to interefere and make Dinizulu king it will be a most serious blow to British power in Africa. They will also become masters of Zululand, 1 [C. 4\u00b037l. 1SS4. p. 90-"], [36, "INTRODUCTION. XXXII to the permanent loss of the Zulu people and the great injury of Natal. . . . For the great interests at stake, I submit that we should not leave question to solve itself, and that if action is to be taken the longer delayed the more difficult it will be. Situation yet possible to save by proclaiming Zululand part of Her Majesty's dominions.\" But Lord Derby still refused to move. Again and again did Sir Henry Bulwer write and telegraph in this sense. He might have spared him self the trouble. The High Commissioner, also acting from Cape Town, forwarded several complaints more or less feeble to the Transvaal Government, which treated them with polite contempt, utterly refusing to interfere. All this while the Boers, who as a people generally know what they want, and are not particular as to the means they employ to get it, were steadily push ing on. On the 1st May 1884 a committee of Dini zulu's volunteers, as they called themselves, sent an ultimatum to Usibepu requesting him to lay down his arms, and informing him that \" we have not come to wage war ; our object is to restore and maintain peace throughout the whole of Zululand.\" On the Sth May Sir Henry Bulwer, writing to Lord Derby, earnestly advanced the claims of Usibepu to assistance against the threatened attack. \"It will,\" he says,1 \"indeed be a cruel case if the Usutus, with the aid of a Boer 1 [C. 4191], 1884, p. 24."], [37, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIII force, are able to defeat Usibepu. It is feared that they will spare neither age nor sex, that no mercy will be shown, and that the finest people in Zululand will be destroyed. Usibepu will not deserve his fate, aud his fate will be a reproach upon us in the native mind which it will not be easy to remove. I would therefore trust that some interposition on our part may yet be in time to avert that fate, and avert the further consequences that will result from it, for there can be no doubt that we shall feel the effect when once we have lost so brave and loyal a friend of the English Government.\" On the 19th June Lord Derby answers this despatch thus : \" You will have learned from the decision conveyed to you in my telegram of the 17th ultimo, that Her Majesty's Government had decided not to sanction military operations beyond the Reserve.\" The \" brave and loyal friend of the English Govern- ment,\" who had been established by the English Government, was to be left to his fate, which he \" did not deserve.\" On the 5th of May it overtook him. 1 The Usutus, assisted by some five hundred of those Boers who had come \" to restore and maintain peace,\" attacked Usibepu at his kraals. At first his warriors drove them back, but the accurate Boer fire was too much for their valour. They were slain by hundreds, men and women together, their cattle were looted, their kraals were burnt, they were utterly destroyed, Usibepu himself barely escaping with his life into the c"], [38, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIV Reserve Territory. Here he pleaded his sad case to Mr. Osborn. \"I and my people belong to the English,\" he said. \" I come to ask those to whom I belong to give me armed assistance.\" He pleaded in vain. The great English people did not hear his cry, spoken in a strange tongue. There is no fouler stain in our history, no not even in South Africa, than this cruel, this wanton and shameless desertion, of a true and gallant friend. The Boers themselves have done nothing quite so black. They at any rate kill and plunder for an end. We had no end to gain unless it was the wretched and paltry end of a few thousand votes which the Government wished to hold or win, and which might have been affected by their taking action. The matter speaks for itself, further comment on it is superfluous. On the 1 6th August i8i4, Dinizulu, King of Zulu land by grace of the Boer volunteers, issued a procla mation in which he makes known that he has ceded to the said volunteers some two million seven hundred and fifty thousand acres of land wherein to establish an independent Republic. This was the heavy price to be paid for the wicked destruction of Usibepu. The proclamation was countersigned by a certain Mr. William Grant, the self-constituted \"representative and adviser \" of the Zulu nation, who appears to have acted as the agent of the Aborigines Protection Society.1 1 Since the above was written, I have been informed by Mr. Chesson, the secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society, that although his Society was in frequent communication with Mr. Grant, to whom it"], [39, "INTRODUCTION. XXXV Mr. Grant's efforts in the cause of Zululand may have been well intentioned, but the method of their execu tion certainly left much to be desired. The same thing may be said of the Society which he represented, or at any rate with which he was in constant com munication, and whose support he received. In their eagerness to promote the aggrandisement of the family of Cetywayo they, in my humble judgment, overlooked the true interests of the unfortunate aborigines they were bound to protect. Who can say that respect for the monarchical principle is on the wane, when a desire to see its triumph in the person of a savage king leads kind-hearted and disinterested men to such destructive excesses ? It is, however, more pleasant to believe that they were beguiled by coloured reports into believing that the interests of the Zulu people were identical with those of Cetywayo's family. Well might the Zulus cry out, as they afterwards did bitterly enough, and more especially the Usutu portion of them. \" Save us from our friend,\" our friend who countersigned a proclamation that robbed us for ever of our birthright. The thing was too much even for the members of the Aborigines Protection Society. On the 17th November 1S841 we find them writing to Lord Derby in vehement defence of Mr. Grant. At the was introduced by Bishop Colenso, and made official use of his letters, he was not its agent. He never received money or instructions from the Society, which only attached importance to his views as those of a person having influence with the Zulus. 1 [C. 4274], 1885, p. 30."], [40, "INTRODUCTION. XXXVI end of their letter, however, they protest against the alienation of territory, sanctioned if not actually pro moted by Mr. Grant himself. They \"venture to express a hope that Her Majesty's Government will refuse to recognise the validity of the cession of so large a portion of Zululand to adventurers from the Transvaal. That agreement is a clear violation of the conditions which the Government have repeatedly imposed upon the Zulus since the conquest of their country by British arms.\" Quite so ! But why did not the Society foresee all this long before ? Why did it not cut short the philanthropic efforts of Mr. William Grant ? It was now too late, the mischief was done, and on Mr. Grant's shoulders rests a large portion of the responsi bility, which is one that few would care to carry. The eyes of the Zulus themselves were soon opened in this matter. So soon as the shoe began to pinch, that is, so soon as the Boers took possession of the farms they had marked out, loud was the outcry raised by the Usutu people. They declare and declare again that Mr. Grant deceived them, that they never understood that they were ceding so much land to the Boers. The blue-books are full of such statements, but one example of them will suffice. On August the 4th and 5th, 18S6, we find Dinizulu himself, Umnyamana, the Prime Minister, and other great Usutu chiefs, writing two letters in Zulu to Sir A. E. Havelock, Sir Henry Bulwer's successor in the Gover-"], [41, "INTRODUCTION. XXXVII norship of Natal.1 The first of these letters deals with their sad state, and more especially with their treatment at the hands of the Boers. \" We are wandering from place to place having nowhere to plant. . . . We shall die and the country will be desolate,\" they say. Then they complain of the desecration of the grave of Senzangacona, the father of Chaka and Dingaan, \" our originator and root.\" A Boer opened the grave and removed the pots placed with the corpse, than which in Zulu eyes there can be no greater sacrilege. \" 0 chief,\" the letter goes on, \" we appeal to you regarding our people. In all the country where there is a Boer \u2014 we need not name any one in particular \u2014 they are beaten, they are tied up, \u2014 men, women, and children; they have wounds on their heads and wheals on their backs, and the eating up of their cattle. With regard to this matter of Mr. Grant's, 0 chief, which says it is we, the head of the Zulu people, who gave the Boers our country, he has invented it for us ; he says nothing but untruth ; we solemnly swear it and we shall die swearing it.\" The letter of the following day deals still more fully with the Zulu \" representa tive and adviser.\" It says that Mr. Grant beguiled them with good words when they were in the position of dead people, \" but alas we were but fatally injuring ourselves ; we took up a torpid snake and put it in our bosom, and behold when it became warm it woke 1 [C. 4980], 1S87, p. 25."], [42, "XXXVIII INTRODUCTION. up and bit us . . . the document written at the Hlobane, which is the cause of our ruin, to say that we had given the Boers our country, was written by him. We here wish to swear solemnly in the face of the chief that we know nothing of that letter, and that he never told one single person of its contents.\" Finally, the letter ends in a formal \" wiping out \" of the name of Mr. Grant. It will be seen from all this that the relations between the Usutu chiefs and their \" representative and adviser \" have become a little strained. He is now a \" torpid snake,\" and a person not too particular about the exact truth. But all this must not be taken too seriously. It is wonderful how differently people look at things when they have an object to gain, and when that object has been gained and resulted in their utter ruin. It is possible that Dinizulu and his chiefs did not under stand the enormous extent of the concessions they were making to the Boers, although Mr. Grant must have understood them well enough. But they did know that they were making concessions, and urged on thereto by the evil advice of their sympathisers and so-called advisers, they in their blind hate against Usibepu, were willing to make them, to their undying sorrow and misfortune. As they have sown so must they reap, and though they were not the only guilty ones all the harvest will be theirs. The Boers were not slow in taking advantage of their position. Without delay they mapped out by"], [43, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIX far the greater part of central Zululand in farms even down to the sea coast. Then at last Her Majesty's Government determined to do something. Under a treaty made in 1843 with Panda, Cetywayo's father, St. Lucia's Bay, a very worthless harbour on the coast of Zululand, was ceded to the English. Lord Derby directed an English man-of-war to proceed thither and hoist the British flag. This accordingly was done. Wandering Boers pulled down or defaced the flag staffs, and the Government of the Transvaal pro tested, claiming the bay as its own. But in the end St. Lucia's Bay remained English property. Meanwhile the state of Zululand and the encroach ment of the Boers was awakening universal anxiety. The colonists of Natal almost to a man petitioned either that British rule should be extended over the whole country, or that it should be annexed to Natal. Lord Derby vanished from the Colonial Office, finding, we may hope, more peace than he left behind him, and Lord Granville ruled in his stead. From this time things began to mend a very little. Perhaps the letter of the Bishop of Zululand,1 in which he prays in fervent language, \" For God's sake, my lord, in common justice and mercy, take over the whole land and rule it,\" produced some little effect. Probably Sir Henry Bulwer's two admirable memoranda,2 in which he sums up the whole recent history of Zulu land, produced more. At any rate we find Sir 1 [C 4913], 1SS7, p. 48. ' Ibid. p. 1, et sea."], [44, "XL INTRODUCTION. A. E. Havelock, the new Governor of Natal, ceasing to be abject and adopting a firmer tone with the Boers of the New Republic. As Sir Henry Bulwer points out in his memoranda the position was now changed. We had allowed the case against us to go by default. The Boers had occupied Zululand and we had assented to their presence. All that we could do was to make the best terms possible under the conditions. We could insist upon some settlement, nothing more. But a very little while before we might, by merely lifting our finger, have preserved Zululand to the Zulus. We would not do this, now it remained to us to save what we could. While Sir A. Havelock negotiated, another untoward incident happened which throws a sufficiently strong light on the treatment the Zulus were meeting with at the hands of the Boers. Dabulamanzi, a brother of Cetywayo's, had a dispute with a Boer about a horse. At the trial he said some words as to the country belonging to Dinizulu, whereon the Field- Cornet arrested him, to be sent, together with his son, to Vrijheid in the escort of two Boers, called Vanderburg and Joubert. After going some way Dabulamanzi, when on the Reserve Territory, refused to proceed. Thereon Vanderburg fired three shots at him and killed him. He also fired at Umzingeli, the son, but did not hit him. Nothing came of this cruel murder, which, being that of a great chief, excited some attention. Indeed it is difficult to recall a case in"], [45, "INTRODUCTION. XLI which a Boer has suffered for the murder of an Englishman or a native. The Home Government remonstrates and inquires, in some cases with the result that the accused persons are brought to trial before a Dutch jury and acquitted, and there the matter ends. In the case of Dabulamanzi the autho rities of the New Republic expressed their inability to find the offender. On the 1 6th October 1886 the Commissioners charged with powers to act on behalf of the Boers in the New Republic, entered into conference with Sir A. Havelock with a view of arriving at a settlement of the boundaries of the state which they had carved out of the heart of Zululand. It is neither interest ing nor useful to trace the negotiations. In the up shot the Boers, feeling that their claim was not a strong one, and mindful of the altered tone of the Colonial Office, moderated their pretensions to a considerable extent, with the result that instead of getting 4234 square miles of territory as they claimed under the agreements with Dinizulu of 1884, they only got 2854 square miles. Under the circumstances this settlement was as good a one as we could hope to make on behalf of the Zulus; indeed both Mr. Stanhope, who was then Secretary of the Colonies, and Sir A. Havelock are to be congratulated on it. Matters had been allowed to drift so far, that the Boers could not have been expelled from Zululand without 1 [C. 5143], 1S87, p. 40."], [46, "XLII INTRODUCTION. recourse to arms, and as that was held to be out of the question it only remained to make the best bargain possible. Of course the settlement was by no means universally popular. The Natal colonists did not like it, and least of all did the Zulus themselves like it. Thus on the nth November 1S86 we find three of the chiefs writing to the Queen, \" the Mother of us all,\" protesting against the cutting off of the country. \"We are your children yesterday, to-day, and to morrow, and for ever. We cry to you as children who have been injured. We cry in the name of the Zulu people.\" This is all very well, and is, moreover, poetically expressed, but what they forget to add is that the Usutus themselves, Mr. William Grant assist ing, made this wicked bargain with the Boers where by a large portion of their tribal inheritance was alienated for ever. They made this bargain, or rather a much worse bargain, in order to enable them to cruelly destroy an unoffending man, Usibepu. And now when the bond has to be fulfilled in part they are loud in their protests. Had it not been for the interference of the English Government the Boers by this time would have had not a third or a half but all of Zululand, and in a very few years the Zulu people would have utterly ceased to be. Of course this argument cannot be pushed too far against the Usutus, for it is the English Government that is really responsible for the partition of Zululand, as it is responsible for every Zulu life that has been"], [47, "INTRODUCTION. XLIII lost since the restoration of Cetywayo. The English Government, notwithstanding its solemn obligations towards them, allowed the Zulus to take a road that must lead them to ruin, indeed by restoring Cetywayo it encouraged them to do so. Then it stood by with folded hands and watched the inevitable result, which it could at any moment have prevented. It allowed the Boers to enter Zululand and destroy its friend and ally, Usibepu, and finally to occupy the land. So it is not fair to lay all the weight of the national mis fortune upon the Usutu leaders. Savages are like children endowed with the strength and intellect (as opposed to the intelligence) of men. They long to attain the object of the moment with the passionate longing of a child for a new toy. Their intellect may warn them of the dangers in the path, they may clearly see these dangers, but their intelligence is over ruled by their desire. They live for the moment and grasp at the advantage of the hour. The spear with which they strike their foe may certainly draw down the lightning on their heads, but they still will strike. In short, there are no human beings who, when they have an interest to serve, are more care less of the future or who take shorter views than savages of the Bantu race \u2014 unless indeed it is those white men who are from time to time responsible for the efficiency and maintenance of Her Majesty's navy. * * But when all is said and done, Dinizulu and his"], [48, "XLIV INTRODUCTION. advisers are still directly to blame for the partition of Zululand. By this time the Colonial Office, now under a regime differing in some particulars from that of Lord Derby, had become convinced of the necessity of action in Zululand. On the 8th February 1887 Mr. Osborn notified to the Zulus that Her Majesty's supreme authority and protection was extended over Zululand beyond the borders of the New Republic. On the nth May 1887 Sir H. Holland, the last of the series of Colonial Secretaries who have had to deal with South African affairs during the five years since Cetywayo's restoration, telegraphed to Sir A. Havelock authorising him to issue a proclamation annexing Zululand, the New Republic, of course, excepted. This proclamation was issued, and received with thankful ness by the natives. Indeed there is only one man in Zululand who can regret this happy change or who shows any sign of giving trouble, and that man is Dinizulu, Cetywayo's son. It is indeed natural that his heart should be sore at seeing himself reduced to the position of a petty pensioned chief under the English Resident. But it must always be borne in mind that, had not the English Government interfered on his behalf, all Zululand would now have passed to the Boers, and he would have had no place to lay his head. Dinizulu has certainly not behaved in a way to entitle him to special consideration at our hands, and even now he is a source of some anxiety to us."], [49, "INTRODUCTION. XLV But if the authorities only show that they aue in earnest, that there will be no more vacillations of policy, that they have command, and mean to keep it, there is little fear that the personal interests and in fluence of Dinizulu will ever be allowed to disturb the peace of what is left of Zululand. Should he at any time attempt a rising, which he would scarcely do unless supported by a Boer commando, it is probable that but a very few of the extreme Usutus would be found to follow him, and his influence would be more than counterbalanced by that of Usibepu, now, I believe, restored to his old chieftainship, of course under the authority of the Eesident. Indeed, there is every prospect of stability in the settlement, of which we may say, taking all things into consideration, that it might have been much worse. Most of Zululand has at any rate been saved, and this result we owe almost entirely to the unselfish and ceaseless efforts of Sir Henry Bulwer and Mr. Osborn, who, in face of official callousness and discouragement, opposition, intrigue, and anarchy, for several years continually strove to save the Zulu people from destruction. It is an instance of a truth which will probably have struck most students of recent South African politics, namely, that the history of the country for good and evil has to a very large degree been shaped by the policy and actions of individuals rather than by that of the Home Government. Thus it was Sir Bartle Frere who embarked upon the Zulu war, and Lord Chelms-"], [50, "XLVI INTRODUCTION. ford who turned it into a war of disaster. In the same way, it is to Sir George Colley's rashness that we owe the retrocession of the Transvaal, for it was not till we had been thrice defeated that we began to realise our bloodguiltiness. To come to minor but happier instances, Sir Henry Bulwer and Mr. Osborn saved Zululand ; Sir Marshall Clarke has done the same for Basutoland, and it is scarcely too much to say that we owe the establishment of British Bechuana land and the salvation of its people to the personal efforts of the Rev. John Mackenzie. In South Africa, as in India and elsewhere, our empire has been built, not by Governments, but by the hands of individuals, and it is to individual ability that we must, to a large extent, look for its maintenance. On the 2 1st June 1887, the day of Her Majesty's Jubilee, Mr. Osborn, before an assemblage of some nine thousand Zulus, which* included most of those chiefs appointed under the Wolseley settlement who still look upon the light, and several members of the royal family, formally annexed what remains of Zulu land to the Crown, and hoisted the Union Jack. Thereon each tribe, forming itself into companies, marched past, every company giving to the flag the royal salute of Bayete. It was a happy occasion and a happy day on which to celebrate the annexation, that, in the words of Sir A. Havelock, \" will confer upon Zululand those blessings of peace, good order, and good government which are secured by British"], [51, "INTRODUCTION. xlvii rule.\" 1 In the Zulu people the Queen will, I am con vinced, find subjects as loyal and as devoted as any that she owns. The country will be no burden on her treasury, for it can easily be made self-supporting, as the Reserve already is ; aud for so long as it is ruled as Zulus expect to be ruled, with firmness and without vacillation, there is little fear of serious disturbance. It is indeed melancholy to think that this act of common justice and mercy, namely, the extension of our authority, might equally well have taken place at the termination of the Zulu war, or, failing that, on the death of Cetywayo. In that case there would now have been no New Boer Republic established in the heart of Zululand, and many thousands of men, women, and children whose bones strew the caves and whiten the veldt would to-day have been alive. But Her Majesty's advisers, in their terror of incurring a responsibility which had already been incurred, would not interfere to save a people and a country. And now, in the end, we have been forced to acknowledge that responsibility and to interfere to save the remnants of the people and such country as the Boers have left to it. The recent history of the Transvaal, now once more a republic, will fortunately admit of much briefer treatment than that of Zululand. It is, so far as England is concerned, very much a history of conces sion. For an account of the first convention I must refer my readers to the remarks which I have made 1 [C. S143I 1SS7, p. 64."], [52, "INTRODUCTION. xlviii in the chapter of this book headed \" The Retroces sion of the Transvaal.\" It will there be seen that the Transvaal Volksraad only ratified the first convention, which was wrung from us (Sir Evelyn Wood, to his honour be it said, dissenting) after our defeats at Lang's Nek, Ingogo, and Majuba, as a favour to the British Government, which in its turn virtually pro mised to reconsider the convention, if only the Volks raad would be so good as to ratify it. This conven tion was ratified in October 1SS1. In June 1883 the Transvaal Government x telegraphs briefly to Lord Derby through the High Commissioner that the Volksraad has \" resolved that time has come to re consider convention.\" Lord Derby quickly telegraphs back that \" Her Majesty's Government consent to inquire into the working of convention.\" Human nature is frail, and it is impossible to help wishing that Lord Palmerston or Disraeli had been appointed by the Fates to answer that telegram. But we have fallen upon different days, and new men have arisen who appear to be suited to them ; and so the conven tion was reconsidered, and on the 27th of February 1884 a new one was signed, which is known as the convention of London. It begins by defining bound aries to which the \" Government of the South African Republic will strictly adhere, . . . and will do its utmost to prevent any of its inhabitants from making any encroachments upon the said boundaries.\" The 1 [C 3659], 18S3."], [53, "INTRODUCTION. XLIX existence of the New Republic in Zululand is a strik ing and practical comment on this article. Article ii. also provides for the security of the amended south west boundary. The proclamation of 16th September 1884 (afterwards disallowed by the English Govern ment), by which the South African Republic practically annexed the territories of Montsioa and Moshette, already for the most part in the possession of its free booters, very clearly illustrates its anxiety to be bound by this provision. Art. xii. provides for the indepen dence of the Swazis ; and by way of illustrating the fidelity with which it has been observed, we shall pre sently have occasion to remark upon the determined attempts that have continually been made by Boer free booters to obtain possession of Swaziland \u2014 and so on. In order to make these severe restrictions palatable to the burghers of a free and haughty Republic, Lord Derby recommends Her Majesty's Government to re mit a trifling sum of ;\u00a3i 27,000 of their debt due to the Imperial Treasury, which was accordingly done. On the whole, the Transvaal had no reason to be dissatisfied with this new treaty, though really the whole affair is scarcely worth discussing. Convention No. 2 is almost as much a farce and a dead letter as was Convention No. 1 . It is, however, impossible to avoid being impressed with the really remarkable tone, not merely of equality, but of superiority, adopted by the South African Republic and its officials towards this country. To take an instance. The Republic had d"], [54, "INTRODUCTION. L found it convenient to wage a war of extermination upon some Kafir chiefs. Two of these, Mampoer and Njabel, fell into its hands. Her Majesty's Government was, rightly or wrongly, so impressed with the injus tice of the sentence of death passed upon these un fortunates, that, acting through Mr. Hudson, the British Resident at Pretoria, it strained every nerve to save them. This was the upshot of it. In a tone of studied sarcasm, His Honour the State President \" observes with great satisfaction the great interest in these cases which has been manifested by your Honour and Her Majesty's Government.\" He then goes on to say that, notwithstanding this interest, Mampoer will be duly and effectually hung, giving the exact time and place of the event, and Njabel imprisoned for life, with hard labour. Finally, he once more con veys \" the hearty thanks of the Government and the members of the Executive Council for the interest manifested in these cases,\" 1 and remains, &c. The independence of Swaziland was guaranteed by the convention of 1S84. Yet the Blue-books are full of accounts of various attempts made by Boers to obtain a footing in Swaziland. Thus in November 1885 Umbandine, the king of Swaziland, sends messengers to the Governor of Natal through Sir T. Shepstone, in which he states that in the winter Piet Joubert, accompanied by two other Boers and an interpreter, came to his kraal and asked him to sign a paper \" to 1 tC. 3S4i]%iSS4>p. 148."], [55, "INTRODUCTION. LI say that he and all the Swazis agreed to go over and recognise the authority of the Boer Government, and have nothing more to do with the English.\" x Um bandine refused, saying that he looked to and recog nised the English Government. Thereon the Boers, growing angry, answered, \" Those fathers of yours, the English, act very slowly ; and if you look to them for help, and refuse to sign this paper, we shall have scattered you and your people, and taken possession of the land before they arrive. Why do you refuse to sign the paper ? You know we defeated the English at Majuba.\" Umbandine's message then goes on to say that he recognises the English Government only, and does not wish to have dealings with the Boers. Also, in the following month, we find him making a direct application to the Colonial Office through Mr. David Forbes,2 praying that his country may be taken under the protection of Her Majesty's Government. More than one such attempt to secure informal rights of occupation in Swaziland appears to have been made by the Transvaal Boers. Mr. T. Shepstone, C.M.G., is at present acting as Eesident to Umbandine, though he has not, it would seem, any regular \u2022 commission from the Home Government authorising him to do so, probably because it does not consider that its rights in Swaziland are such as to justify such an assumption of formal authority over the Swazis. However this may be, Umbandine could not have found a better 1 [C. 4645], 1SS6, p. 64. 2 Ibid, p 70."], [56, "INTRODUCTION. LII man to protect his interests. Of course, when acts like that of Piet Joubert are reported to the Govern ment of the South African Republic and made the subject of a remonstrance by this country, all know ledge of them is repudiated, as it was repudiated in the case of the invasion of Zululand. It is part of the policy of the Transvaal only to become an accessory after the fact. Its subjects go forth and stir up trouble among the natives, and then probably the Boer Government intervenes \" in the in terests of humanity,\" and takes, or tries to take, the country. This process is always going on, and, unless the British Government puts a stop to it, always will go on. We shall probably soon hear that it is de veloping itself in the direction of Matabeleland. A country the size of France, which could without diffi culty accommodate a population of from eight to ten millions of industrious folk, is not large enough for the wants of a Boer people, numbering soniethinc* under fifty thousand souls. Every young Boer must have his six or more thousand acres of land on which to lord it. It is his birthright, and if it is not forth coming he goes and takes it by force from the nearest native tribe. Hence these continual complaints. Of course, there are two ways of looking at the matter. There is a party that does not hesitate to say that the true policy of this country is to let the Boers work their will upon the natives, and then, as they in turn fly from civilisation towards the far interior, to follow"], [57, "INTRODUCTION. LIII on their path and occupy the lands that they have swept. This plan is supported by arguments about the superiority of the white races and their obvious destiny of rule. It is, I confess, one that I look upon as little short of wicked. I could never discern a superiority so great in ourselves as to authorise us, by right divine as it were, to destroy the coloured man and take his lands. It is difficult to see why a Zulu, for instance, has not as much right to live in his own way as a Boer or an Englishman. Of course, there is another extreme. Nothing is more ridiculous than the length to which the black brother theory is sometimes driven by enthusiasts. A savage is one thing, and a civilised man is another ; and though civilised men may and do become savages, I personally doubt if the converse is even possible. But whether the civilised man, with his gin, his greed, and his dynamite, is really so very superior to the savage is another question, and one which would bear argument, although this is not the place to argue it. My point is, that his superiority is not at any rate so absolutely overwhelming as to justify him in the wholesale destruction of the savage and the occupation of his lands, or even in allow ing others to do the work for him if he can prevent it. The principle might conceivably be pushed to in convenient and indecent lengths. Savagery is only a question of degree. When all true savages have been wiped out, the most civilised and self-righteous among the nations may begin to give the term to those whom"], [58, "LIV INTRODUCTION. they consider to be on a lower scale than themselves, and apply the argument also. Thus there are \" cul tured \" people in another land who do not hesitate to say that the humble writers of these islands are rank and rude barbarians not to be endured. Supposing that, being the stronger, they also applied the argument, it would be inconvenient for some of us, and perhaps the world would not gain so very much after all. But this is a digression, only excusable, if excusable at all, in one who has endured a three weeks' course of unmitigated Blue-book. To return. The process of absorption attempted in Swaziland, and brought to a successful issue in Zululand, also went forward merrily in Bechuanaland, till recently, under the rule of Mankorane, chief of the Batlapins, and Montsioa, chief of the Baralongs. These two chiefs have always been devoted friends and adhe rents of the English Government, and consequently are not regarded with favour by the Boers. Shortly after the retrocession of the Transvaal, a rival to Mankorane rose up in the person of a certain Massou, and a rival to Montsioa named Moshette. Both Massou and Moshette were supported by Boer fillibusters, and what happened to Usibepu in Zululand happened to these unfortunate chiefs in Bechuanaland. They were defeated after a gallant struggle, and two Republics called Stellaland and Goschen were carved out of their territories and occupied by the fillibusters. Fortunately for them, however, they had a friend in"], [59, "INTRODUCTION. LV the person of the Rev. John Mackenzie, to whose valuable work, \" Austral Africa,\" I beg to refer the reader for a fuller account of these events. Mr. Mackenzie, who had for many years lived as a mis-. sionary among the Bechuanas,had also mastered the fact that it is very difficult to do anything for South Africa in this country unless you can make it a question of votes, or, in other words, unless you can bring pressure to bear upon the Government. Accordingly he com menced an agitation on behalf of Mankorane and Mont sioa, in which he was supported by various religious bodies, and also by the late Mr. Forster and the Aborigines Protection Society. As a result of this agitation he was appointed Deputy to the High Com missioner for Bechuanaland, whither he proceeded early in 1884 to establish a British protectorate. He was gladly welcomed by the unfortunate chiefs, who were now almost at their last gasp, and who both of them ceded their rights of government to the Queen. Hostilities did not, however, cease, for on the 3 1 st July 1884 the fillibusters again attacked Montsoia, routed him, and cruelly murdered Mr. Bethell, his English adviser. Meanwhile Mr. Mackenzie's success was viewed with very mixed feelings at the Cape. To the English party it was most acceptable, but the Dutch,1 and more numerous party, looked on it with 1 By the Dutch party I mean the anti- Imperial and retrogressive party. It must be remembered that many of the now educated and progressive Boers do not belong to this."], [60, "INTRODUCTION. LVI alarm and disgust. They did not at all wish to see the Imperial power established in Bechuanaland; so pressure was put upon Sir Hercules Robinson, and through him on Mr. Mackenzie, to such an extent indeed as to necessitate the resignation of the latter. Thereon the High Commissioner despatched a Cape politician, Mr. Cecil Rhodes, and his own private secretary, Captain Bower, R.N., to Bechuanaland. These gentle men at once set to work to undo most of what Mr. Mackenzie had done, and, generally speaking, did not advance either British or native interests in Bechuana land. At this point, taking advantage of the general confusion, the Government of the South African Re public issued a proclamation placing both Montsioa and Moshette under its protection, as usual \" in the interests of humanity.\" But the agitation in England had, fortunately for what remained of the Bechuana people, not been allowed to drop. Her Majesty's Government dis allowed the Boer proclamation, under Article iv. of the convention of London, and despatched an armed force to Bechuanaland, commanded by Sir Charles Warren. This good act, I believe I am right in saying, we owe entirely to the firmness of Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain, who insisted upon its being done. Meanwhile Messrs. Upington and Sprigg, mem bers of the Cape Government, hastened to Bechuanaland to effect a settlement before the arrival of Sir Charles Warren's force. This settlement, though it might"], [61, "INTRODUCTION. LVII have been agreeable to the fillibusters and the anti- Imperialists generally, was disallowed by Her Majesty's Government as unsatisfactory, and Sir Charles Warren was ordered to occupy Bechuanaland. This he accord ingly did, taking Mr. Mackenzie with him, very much against the will of the anti-English party, and, be it added, of Sir Hercules Robinson. Indeed, if we may accept Mr. Mackenzie's version of these occurrences, which seems to be a fair one, and adequately supported by documentary evidence, the conduct of Sir Hercules Robinson towards Mr. Mackenzie would really admit of explanation. As soon as the freebooters saw that the Imperial Government was really in earnest, of course there was no more trouble. They went away, and Sir Charles Warren took possession of Bechuana land without striking a single blow. He remained in the country for nearly a year arranging for its per manent pacification and government, and as a result of his occupation, on the-\u00bb30th September 1885, all the territory south of the Molopo River was declared to be British territory, and made into a quasi crown colony, the entire extent of land, including the districts ruled over by Khama, Sechele, and Gasitsive, being about 1 60,000 square miles in area. I believe that the new colony of British Bechuanaland is proving a very con siderable success. Every provision has been made for native wants, and its settlement goes on apace. There is no reason why, with its remarkable natural advan tages, it should not one day become a great country,"], [62, "lviii INTRODUCTION. with a prosperous white, and a loyal and contented native population. When this comes about it is to be hoped that it will remember that it owes its existence to the energy and firmness of Mr. Mackenzie, Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Chamberlain, and Sir Charles Warren. It is probably by now dawning upon the mind of the British public that when we gave up the Trans vaal we not only did a cowardly thing and sowed a plentiful crop of future troubles, we also abandoued one of the richest, if not the richest, country in the world. The great gold-fields which exist all over the surface of the land are being opened up and pouring out their treasures so fast that it is said that the Transvaal Government, hitherto remarkable for its impecuniosity, does not know what to do with its superfluous cash. To what extent this will continue it is impossible to say, but I for one shall not be sur prised if the output should prove to be absolutely unprecedented. And with5 gold in vast quantities, with iron in mountains, and coal-beds to be measured by the scores of square miles, with lead and copper and cobalt, a fertile soil, water, and one of the most lovely climates in the world, what more is required to make a country rich and great ? Only one thing, an Anglo-Saxon Government, and that we have taken away from the Transvaal. Whether the English flag lias vanished for ever from its borders is, however, still an open question. The discovery of gold in such quantities is destined to exercise a very remarkable"], [63, "INTRODUCTION. LIX influence upon the future of the Transvaal. Where gold is to be found, there the hardy, enterprising, English-speaking diggers flock together, and before them and their energy the Boer retreats, as the native retreats and vanishes before the rifle of the Boer. Already there are many thousands of diggers in the Transvaal ; if the discoveries of gold go on and prove as remunerative as they promise to be, in a few more years their number will be vastly increased. Sup posing that another five years sees sixty or seventy thousand English diggers at work in the Transvaal, is it to be believed that these men will in that event allow themselves to be ruled by eight or nine thousand hostile-hearted Boers ? Is it to be believed, too, that the Boers will stop to try and rule them ? From such knowledge as I have of their character I should say certainly not. They will trek, anywhere out of the way of the Englishman and his English ways, and those who do not trek will be absorbed. Should this happen, it is, of course, possible, and even \u25a0 probable, that for some time the diggers, fearing the vacillations of Imperial policy, would prefer to remain independent with a Republican form of Government. But the Englishman is a law-abiding and patriotic creature, and as society settled itself in the new community, it would almost certainly desire to be united to the Empire and acknowledge the sovereignty of the Queen. So far as a judgment can be formed, if only the gold holds out the Transvaal will as certainly fall into the"], [64, "INTRODUCTION. LX lap of the Empire as a green apple will one clay drop from the tree \u2014 that is, if it is not gathered. Now it is quite possible that the Germans, or some other power, may try to gather the Transvaal apple. The Boers are not blind to the march of events, and they dislike us and our rule. Perhaps they might think it worth their while to seek German protection, and unless we are prepared to say \" no \" very firmly indeed \u2014 and who knows, in the present condition of Home politics, what we are prepared to do from one day to another ? \u2014 Germany would in such a case almost certainly think it worth her while to give it. Very likely the protection, when granted, would in some ways resemble that which the Boer himself, his breast aglow with love of peace and the \" interests of humanity,\" is so anxious to extend to the misguided native pos sessor of desirable and well-watered lands. Very likely, in the end, the Boer would be sorry that he did not accept the ills he knew of. But that is neither here nor there. So far as we are concerned, the mischief would be done. In short, should the position arise, everything will depend upon our capacity of saying \" no,\" and the tone in which we say it. It will not do to rely upon our London convention, by which the Transvaal is forbidden to conclude treaties with outside powers without the consent of this Govern ment. The convention has been broken before now, and will be broken again, if the Boers find it con venient to break it, and know that they can do so"], [65, "INTRODUCTION. LXI with impunity. Meanwhile we must rest on our oars and watch events. One thing, however, might and should be done. Some person having weight and real authority \u2014 if he were quite new to South Africa so much the better \u2014 should be appointed as our Consul to watch over the welfare of Englishmen and our Imperial interests at Pretoria, and properly paid for doing so. It is difficult to find a suitable man unless he is adequately salaried and supported. But quite recently this country has awakened to the knowledge that Delagoa Bay is important to its South African interests, though how important it per haps does not altogether realise. For years and years the colony of Natal has been employed in the inter mittent construction of a railway with a very narrow gauge, which is now open as far as Ladysmith, or to within a hundred miles of the Transvaal border. Natal is very poor, and in common with the rest of South Africa, and indeed of the world, has lately been passing through a period of great commercial depres sion. The Home Government has refused to help it to construct its railways (if it had done so, how many hundreds of thousand pounds would have been saved to the British taxpayer during the Zulu and Boer wars !), and has equally refused to allow it to borrow sufficient money to get them constructed, with the result that a large amount of the interior trade has already been deflected into other channels. And now a fresh and very real danger, not only to Natal, but to"], [66, "LXII INTRODUCTION. all Imperial interests in South Africa, has sprung into sudden prominence, that is, in this country, for in Africa it has been foreseen for many years. Above Zululand is situated Amatongaland, which reaches to the southern shore of one of the finest harbours in the world, Delagoa Bay. This great bight, in which half a dozen navies could ride at anchor, the only really good haven on the coasts of South Africa, is fifty-five miles in width and twenty in depth, that is, from east to west. It is separated from the Transvaal, of which it is the natural port, by about ninety miles of wild and sparsely inhabited country. The ownership of this splendid port was for many years in dispute between this country and the Portu guese, with whose dominions of Mozambique it is con nected by a strip of coast, and who have a small fort upon it. This dispute was finally referred by Lord Granville in 1872 to the decision of Marshal MacMahon, and on this occasion, as on every other in which this country has been weak enough to go to arbitration, that decision was given against us. Into the merits of the case it is not necessary to enter, further than to say, as has already been recently pointed out by a very able and well-informed corre spondent of the Morning Post, that it is by no means clear by what right the matter was referred to arbitra tion at all. The Amatongas are in possession of the southern shore of the bay, including, I believe, the Inyack Peninsula and Inyack Island, and they are"], [67, "INTRODUCTION. lxiii an independent people. The Swazis also abut on it, and they are independent. What warrant had we to refer their rights to the arbitration of Marshal MacMahon ? The evidence of the exercise of any Portuguese sovereignty over these countries is so shadowy that it may be said never to have existed ; certainly it does not exist now. This is a point, but it is nothing more. We must take things as we find them, and we find that the Portuguese have been for mally declared and admitted by us to be the owners of Delagoa Bay. Now, so long as we held the Transvaal it did not so much matter who had the sovereignty of the Bay, since a railway constructed from there could only run to British territory. But we gave up the Transvaal, which is now virtually a hostile state, and the contingency which has been so long foreseen in South Africa, and so blindly overlooked at home, has come to pass \u2014 the railway is in course of rapid completion. What does this mean to us ? At the best, it means that we lose the greater part of the trade of South-eastern Africa; at the worst, that we lose it all. In other words, it means, putting aside the question of our Imperial needs and status in Africa, a great many millions a year in hard cash out of the national pocket. Let us suppose that the worst hap pens, and that the Germans get a footing either in the Transvaal or Delagoa Bay. Obviously they will stop our trade in favour of their own. Or let us"], [68, "LXIV INTRODUCTION. suppose that the Transvaal takes advantage of one of our spasms of Imperial paralysis, such as afflicted us during the regime of Lord Derby, and defies the pro vision in the convention which forbids them to put a heavier tax upon our goods than upon those of any other nation. In either event our case would be a bad one, for our road from the eastern coast to the vast interior is blocked. But it is of little use crying over spilt milk, or anticipating evils which it is our duty to try to avert, and which in all probability still could be averted by a sound and consistent policy. To begin with, both Swaziland and Amatongaland can be annexed to the Empire. It is true that the in dependence of the first of these countries is guaranteed by Article xii. of the convention of London of 18S4. Here is the exact wording : \u2014 \" The independence of the Swazis within the boundary-line of Swaziland, as indicated in the first article of this convention, will be fully recognised.\" But England has for years exercised a kind of protective right over Swaziland \u2014 a right, as I have already shown, fully acknowledged and frequently appealed to by the Swazis themselves. And for the rest, what is the obvious meaning of this provision ? It means that the independence of Swazi land is guaranteed against Boer encroachments ; its object was to protect the Swazis from extermination at . the hands of the Boers. Further, the Boers have again and again broken this article of the convention"], [69, "INTRODUCTION. LXV in their repeated attempts to get a foothold in Swazi land. It has now become necessary to our interests that the Swazis should come under our rule, as indeed they are most anxious to do, and a way should be found by which this end can be accomplished. Then as to Amatongaland, or Maputaland, as it is sometimes called, only a month or two ago an embassy from the Queen of that country waited on the Colonial Office, praying for British protection. It is not known what answer they received ; let us trust that it was a favourable one.1 The protection that should be accorded to the Amatongas, both in their interests and our own, is annexation to the British Empire upon such terms as might be satisfactoiy to them. The management of their country might be left to them, subject to the advice of a Resident, and the enforcement of the ordinary laws respecting life and property common to civilised states. Drink and white men might be strictly excluded from it, unless the Amatongas should wish to welcome the latter. But the country, with its valuable but undefined rights over Delagoa Bay, should belong to England, for whoever owns Swaziland and Amatongaland will in course of time be almost certain to own the Bay also. It must 1 I understand that the treaty which we have concluded with Amatongaland (where, by the way, it is said a new harbour has been discovered) binds the authorities of that country not to cede territory lo any other Power. But there is nothing in such a treaty to prevent, say Portugal or the Boers, from taking possession of the land by force of arms. Were the country annexed to the Crown, or a British Pro tectorate established, they would not dare to do this. e"], [70, "LXVI INTRODUCTION. further be remembered that circumstances have already given us certain rights over the Amatongas. They regarded Cetywayo as their suzerain, and it was, I believe, at his instance that Zambila was appointed regent during the minority of her son. As we have annexed what remains of Zululand, Cetywayo's suze rainty has consequently passed to us. Meanwhile, can nothing be done by direct treaty with the Portuguese ? A little while ago the Bay could no doubt have been acquired for a very mode rate consideration, but those golden opportunities have been allowed to slip from hands busy weaving the web of party politics. Now it is a different affair. Delagoa Bay is of no direct value to Portugal except for the honour and glory of the thing. Portugal has never done anything with it, any more than she has with her other African possessions, and never will do any thing with it. But it has become very valuable, indeed, so far as its South African interests are con cerned, almost vital, to this country, and of that fact Portugal is perfectly well aware. Consequently, if we want the Bay we must pay for it, if not in cash, at the offer of which the Portuguese national pride might be revolted, then in some other equivalent. Surely a power like England could find a way of obliging one like Portugal in return for this small concession. Or an exchange of territory might be effected. Perhaps Portugal might be inclined to accept of some of our possessions on the West Coast"], [71, "INTRODUCTION. lxvii or an island or two in the West Indies. It is hard to suppose that there is no way out of the trouble ; but if indeed there is none, why, then, one must be found, or we must be content to lose a great part of our African trade. The reader who has followed me through this brief and imperfect summary of recent events in South Africa will see how varied are its interests, how enormous its areas, and how vast its wealth. In that great country England is still the paramount power. Her prestige has, indeed, been greatly shaken, and she is sadly fallen from her estate of eight or nine years gone. But she is still paramount ; and if she has to face the animosity of a section of the Boers, she can, notwith standing her many crimes against them, set against it the love and respect of every native in the land, with the exception, perhaps, of a few self-seekers and intriguers. The history of the next twenty years, and perhaps of the next ten, will decide whether this country is to remain paramount or whether South Africa is to be come a great Dutch, English-hating Republic. There are some who call themselves Englishmen, and who. possessed by that strange itch which prompts them to desire any evil that can humble their country in the face of her enemies, or can bring about the advantage of the rebel to the injury of the loyal subject, to whom this last event would be most welcome, and who have not hesitated to say that it would be welcome. To such there is nothing to be said. Let them follow"], [72, "lxviii INTRODUCTION. their false lights and earn the wonder of true-hearted men and the maledictions of posterity. But, addressing those of other and older doctrines, I would ask what such an event would mean ? It would mean nothing less than a great national cala mity; it would mean the utter ruin of the native tribes ; and, to come to a reason which has a wider popularity, for as I think Mr. S. Little says in his work on South Africa, \" the argument to the pocket is the best argument to the man,\" it would mean the loss of a vast trade, which, if properly protected, will be growing while we are sleeping And this calamity can yet be averted ; the mistakes and cowardice of the past can still be remedied, at any rate to a great extent ; the door is yet open. We have many difficulties to face, among the chief of which are the Transvaal, the question of Delagoa Bay, and last, but not least, the question of the Dutch party at the Cape, which may be numerically the strongest party. When, in our mania for representative institutions, we thrust responsible government upon the Cape, we placed ourselves practically at the mercy of any chance anti-English majority. It is possible that in the future we may find some such majority urging upon an English Ministry the desirability of the separation of the Cape Colony from the Empire, and may find also that the prayer meets with favourable attention from those to whom there is but one thing sacred, the rights of a majority, and especially of an agitating majority."], [73, "INTRODUCTION. LXIX But let not the country be deceived by any such representations. The natives too have a right to a voice in the disposal of their fortunes and their lands. They are the majority in the proportion of three to one, and let any doubter go and ask of them, any where from the Zambesi to Cape Agulhas, whether they would rather be ruled by the Queen or by a Boer Republic, and hear the answer. When it was a question of surrendering the Transvaal we heard a great deal of the rights of some thirty thousand Boers, and very little, or rather nothing, of the rights of the million natives who lived in the country with them, and to whom that country originally belonged. And yet, if the reader will turn to that part of this book which deals with the question, he will find that they had an opinion, and a strong one. No settlement of South African questions that does not receive adequate consideration from a native point of view can be a just settlement, or one which the Home Government should sanction. Moreover, the Cape is not by any means entirely anti-English at heart, as was shown clearly enough by the number and enthusiasm of the loyalist meetings when its Ministry was attempting to undo Mr. Mackenzie's work in Bechuanaland in the interests of the Patriot-party. Still, it is possible that movements may arise under the fostering care of the Africander Bond and its sym pathisers, having for object the separation of the colony from the Empire, or other ends fatal to Imperial in-"], [74, "LXX INTRODUCTION. terests ; and in this case the Home Government should be prepared to disallow and put a final stop to them. We cannot afford to lose our alternative route to India and to throw these great territories into the hands of enemies, from which they would very probably pass into those of commercial rivals. In such an event all that would be required is a show of firmness. If once it was known that an English Ministry really meant what it said, and that its promises made in the Queen's name were not liable to be given the lie by a succeeding set of politicians elected on another platform, there would be an end to disloyalty and agitation in South Africa. As it is, loyalists, remembering the experiences of the last few years, are faint-hearted, never knowing if they will meet with support at home, while agitators and enemies wax exceeding bold. Our system of party government, whatever may be its merits, if any, as applied to Home politics, is a great enemy to the welfare and progress of our Colonies, the affairs of which are, especially of late years, frequently used as stalking-horses to cover an attack upon the other side. Could not the two great parties agree to rule Colonial affairs, and especially South African affairs, out of the party game ? Could not the policy of the Colonial Office be guided by a Commission composed of members of different political opinions, and responsible not to party, but to Parliament and the country, instead of by a succession of Ministers as variable and as transitory as shadows ? Lord Rosebery and Mr. Chamberlain,"], [75, "INTRODUCTION. LXXI for instance, are Radicals ; but, putting aside party tactics and exigencies, are their views upon Colonial matters so widely different from those of, let us say, Sir Michael Hicks Beach and Lord Carnarvon that it would be impossible for these four gentlemen to act together on such a Commission ? Surely they are not ; and perhaps a day may come when the common-sense of the country will lead it to adopt some such system which would give to the Colonies a fixed and intelli gent control aiming at the furtherance of the joint interests of the Empire and its dependencies. If it ever does, that day will be a happy one for all concerned. Meanwhile, there is, so far as South Africa is con cerned, a step that might be taken to the great benefit of that country, and also of our Imperial aims, and that is the appointment of a High Commissioner who would have charge of all Imperial as distinguished from the various Colonial interests. This appointment has already been advocated with ability by Mr. Mackenzie in the last chapter of his book, \" Austral Africa,\" and it is undoubtedly one that should receive the consideration of the Government. Such an officer would not supersede the Governors of the various colonies or the administrators of the native territories, although, so far as Imperial interests were concerned, they would be primarily responsible to him. At present there is no central authority except the Colonial Office, and Downing Street is a long way off and somewhat overworked. Each Governor must necessarily look at"], [76, "lxxii INTRODUCTION. South African affairs from his own standpoint and through local glasses. What is wanted is a man of the first ability, whose name would command respect abroad and support at home; and several such men could be found, who would study South African politics as a whole as an engineer studies a map, and who would set himself to conciliate and reconcile all interests for the common welfare and the welfare of the mother-country. Such a man, or rather a succession of such men, might, if properly supported, succeed in bringing about a very different state of affairs from that which has been briefly reviewed and considered in these pages. They might, little by little, build up a South African Con federation, strong in itself and loyal to England, that shall in time become a great empire. For my part, notwithstanding the difficulties and dangers which we have brought upon ourselves, and upon the various South African territories and their inhabitants, I be lieve that such an empire is destined to arise, and that it will not take the form of a Dutch Republic. H. RIDER HAGGARD. 2$th January 1888."], [77, "PREFACE. The writer on Colonial Affairs is naturally, to some extent, discouraged by the knowledge that the subject is an un attractive one to a large proportion of the reading public. It is difficult to get up anything beyond a transient interest in the affairs of our Colonial dependencies; indeed, I believe that the mind of the British public was more profoundly moved by the exodus of Jumbo, than it would be were one of them to become the scene of some startling catastrophe. This is the more curious, inasmuch as, putting aside all sentimental considerations, which indeed seem to be out of harmony with the age we live in, the trade done, even with such comparatively insignificant colonies as our South African possessions, amounts to a value of many millions of pounds sterling per annum. Now, as the preachers of the new gospel that hails from Birmingham and North ampton have frequently told us, trade is the life-blood of England, and must be fostered at any price. It is there fore surprising that, looking on them in the light of a com mercial speculation, in which aspect (saith the preacher) they are alone worthy of notice, a keener interest is not taken in the well-being and development of the Colonies. We have only to reflect to see how great are the advantages that the Mother Country derives from the possession of her Colonial Empire : including, as they do, a home for her surplus children, a vast and varied market for her"], [78, "Ixxiv PREFACE. productions, and a wealth of old-fashioned loyalty and deep attachment to the Old Country \u2014 \" home,\" as it is always called \u2014 which, even if it is out of date, might prove useful on emergency. It seems, therefore, almost a pity that some Right Honourable Gentlemen and their followers should adopt the tone they do with reference to the Colonies. After all, there is an odd shuffling of the cards going on now in England ; and great as she is, her future looks by no means sunny. Events in these latter days develop themselves very quickly; and though the idea may, at the present moment, seem absurd, surely it is possible that, what between the rapid spread of Radical ideas, the enmity of Ireland, the importation of foreign produce, and the competition of foreign trade, to say nothing of all the unforeseen accidents and risks of the future, the Englishmen of, say, two generations hence, may not find their country in her present proud position. Perhaps, and stranger things have happened in the his tory of the world, she may by that time be under the pro tection of those very Colonies for which their forefathers had such small affection. The position of South Africa with reference to the Mother Country is somewhat different to that of her sister Colonies, in that she is regarded, not so much with apathy tinged with dislike, as with downright disgust. This feel ing has its foundation in the many troubles and expenses in which this country has been recently involved, through local complications in the Cape, Zululand, and the Trans vaal : and indeed is little to be wondered at. But, whilst a large portion of the press has united with a powerful party of politicians in directing a continuous stream of abuse on to the heads of the white inhabitants of South Africa, whom they do not scruple to accuse of having created the recent disturbances in order to reap a money"], [79, "PREFACE. LXXV profit from them, it does not appear to have struck any body that the real root of this crop of troubles might, after all, be growing nearer home. The truth of the matter is, that native and other problems in South Africa have, till quite lately, been left to take their chance, and solve themselves as best they might ; except when they have, in a casual manner, been made the corpus vile of some political experiment. It was during this long period of inaction, when each difficulty \u2014 such as the native question in Natal \u2014 was staved off to be dealt with by the next Government, that the seed was sown of which we are at present reaping the fruit. In addition to this, matters have recently been complicated by the elevation of South African affairs to the dignity of an English party question. Thus, the Transvaal Annexation was made use of as a war-cry at the last general election, a Boer rebellion was thereby encouraged, which resulted in a complete reversal of our previous policy. Now, if there is any country dependent on England that requires the application to the conduct of its affairs of a firm, considered, and consistent policy, that country is South Africa. Boers and Natives are quite incapable of realising the political necessities of any of our parties, or of understanding why their true interests should be sacri ficed in order to minister to those necessities. It is our wavering and uncertain policy, as applied to peoples, who look upon every hesitating step as a sign of fear and failing dominion, that, in conjunction witli previous postponement and neglect, has really caused our troubles in South Africa. For so long as the affairs of that country are influenced by amateurs and sentimentalists, who have no real interest in it, and whose knowledge of its circumstances and conditions of life is gleaned from a few blue-books, superficially got up to enable the reader to indite theoretical articles to the"], [80, "lxxvi PREFACE. Nineteenth Century, or deliver inaccurate speeches in the House of Commons \u2014 for so long will those troubles continue. If I may venture to make a suggestion, the affairs of South Africa should be controlled by a Board or Council, like that which formerly governed India, composed of moderate members of both parties, with an admixture of men possessing practical knowledge of the country. I do not know if any such arrangement would be possible under our constitution, but the present system of govern ment, by which the control of savage races fluctuates in obedience to every variation of English party politics, is most mischievous in its results. The public, however, is somewhat tired of South Africa, and the reader may, perhaps, wonder why he should be troubled with more literature on the subject. I can assure him that these pages are not written in order to give me an opportunity of airing my individual experiences or ideas. Their object is shortly \u2014 I. To give a true history of the events attendant on the Annexation of the Transvaal, which act has so frequently been assigned to the most unworthy motives, and has never yet been fairly described by any one who was in a position to know the facts. 2. To throw as much publicity as possible on the present disgraceful state of Zululand, resulting from our recent settlement in that country. 3. To show all interested in the Kafir races what has been the character of our recent surrender in the Transvaal, and what its effect will be on our abandoned native subjects living in that country. It may, perhaps, seem an odd statement, considering that I have lived in various parts of South Africa for about six years, and have, perhaps, enjoyed exceptional advantage in forming my opinions, when I say that my chief fear in publishing the present volume, is lest my knowledge"], [81, "PREFACE. Ixxvii of my subject in all its bearings should not be really equal to the task. It is, I know, the fashion to treat South African difficulties as being simple of solution. Thus it only took Sir Garnet Wolseley a few weeks to understand the whole position of Zulu affairs, and to execute his memorable settlement of that country : whilst eminent writers appear to be able, in scampering from Durban vid Kimberley to Cape Town in a post-cart, to form decided opinions upon every important question in South Africa. The power of thus rapidly assimilating intricate knowledge, and of seeing straight through a wall whilst ordinary in dividuals are still criticising the bricks, is no doubt one of the peculiar privileges of genius \u2014 which is, perhaps fortunately for South Africa, rare. To the common run of mind, however, the difficulty of forming a sound and accurate judgment on the interlacing problems that dis close themselves to the student of the politics of South- Eastern Africa, is exceedingly great and the work of years. But although it is by no means perfect, I think that my knowledge of these problems and of their imminent issues is sufficiently intimate to justify me in making a prophecy \u2014 namely, that unless the native and other questions of South-Eastern Africa are treated with more honest intelli gence, and on a more settled plan than it has hitherto been thought necessary to apply to them, the British taxpayer will find that he has by no means heard the last of that country and its wars. There is one more point to which, although it hardly comes within the scope of this volume, I have made some allusion, and which I venture to suggest deserves the con sideration of thinking Englishmen. I refer to the question of the desirability of allowing the Dutch in South Africa, who are already numerically the strongest, to continue to advance with such rapid strides towards political supremacy."], [82, "Ixxviii PREFACE. That the object of this party is to reduce Englishmen and English ideas to a subordinate position in the State, if not actually to rid itself of our rule and establish a republic, there is no manner of doubt. Indeed, there exists a powerful organisation, the Africander Bond, which has its headquarters in the Cape, and openly devotes its energies to forwarding these ends, by offering a sturdy opposition to the introduction of English emigrants and the use of the English language, whilst striving in every way to excite class prejudices and embitter the already strained relations between Englishman and Boer. In considering this question, it is as well not to lose sight of the fact that the Dutch are, as a body, at heart hostile to our rule, chiefly because they cannot tolerate our lenient behaviour to the native races. Should they by any chance cease to be the subjects of England, they will, I believe, become her open enemies. This of itself would be comparatively unimpor tant, were it not for the fact that, in the event of the blocking of the Suez Canal, it would be, to say the least, inconvenient that the Cape should be in the hands of a hostile population. In conclusion, I wish to state that this book is not written for any party purpose. I have tried to describe a state of affairs which has for the most part come under my own observation, and events in which I have been interested, and at times engaged. That the naked truths of such a business as the Transvaal surrender, or of the present condition of Zululand, are unpleasant reading for an Englishman, there is no doubt ; but, so far as these pages are concerned, they owe none of their ugliness to undue colouring or political bias. Windham Club, St. James' Square, June 18S2."], [83, "CETYWAYO AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT."], [84, ""], [85, "CETYWAYO AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. Zululand and the Zulu settlement still continue to receive some attention from the home public, partly because those responsible for the conduct of affairs are not quite at ease about it, and partly because of the agitation in this country for the restoration of Cetywayo. There is no doubt that the present state of affairs in Zululand is a subject worthy of close consideration, not only by those officially connected with them, but by the public at large. Nobody, either at home or in the colonies, wishes to see another Zulu war, or any thing approaching to it. Unless, however, the affairs of Zululand receive a little more attention, and are superintended with a little more humanity and intel ligence than they are at present, the public will sooner or later be startled by some fresh catastrophe. Then will follow the usual outcry, and the disturbance will be attributed to every cause under the sun except the right one \u2014 want of common precautions. The Zulu question is a very large one, and I only propose discussing so much of it as is necessary to the proper consideration of the proposed restoration of Cetywayo to his throne. A"], [86, "CETYWAYO 2 The king is now coming to England,1 where he will doubtless make a very good impression, since his appear- ance is dignified, and his manners, as is common among Zulus of high rank, are those of a gentleman. It is probable that his visit will lead to a popular agitation in his favour, and very possibly to an attempt on the part of the English Government to reinstate him in his kingdom. Already Lady Florence Dixie waves his banner, and informs the public through the columns of the newspapers how good, how big, and how beautiful he is, and \"F. W. G. X.\" describes in enthusiastic terms his pearl-like teeth. But as there are interests involved in the question of his reinstatement which are, I think, more important than Cetywayo's personal proportions of mind or body, and as the results of such a step would necessarily be very marked and far-reach ing, it is as well to try and understand the matter in all its bearings before anything is done. There has been a great deal of special pleading about Cetywayo. Some writers, swayed by sentiment, and that spirit of partisanship that the sight of royalty in distress always excites, whitewash him in such a per sistent manner that their readers are left under the impression that the ex-king is a model of injured innocence and virtue. Others again, for political reasons, paint him very black, and predict that his restoration would result in the destruction, or at the least, disorganisation, of our South African empire. The 1 Since the above was written the Government have at the last moment decided to postpone Cetywayo's visit to this country, chiefly on account of the political capital which was being made out of the event by agitators in Zululand. The project of bringing the king to England does not, however, appear to have been abandoned."], [87, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 3 truth in this, as in the majority of political controversies, lies somewhere between these two extremes, though it is difficult to say exactly where. To understand the position of Cetywayo both with reference to his subjects and the English Government, it will be necessary to touch, though briefly, on the history of Zululand since it became a nation, and also on the principal events of the ex-king's reign. Chaka, Cetywayo's great uncle, was the first Zulu king, and doubtless one of the most remarkable men that has ever filled a throne since the days of the Pharaohs. When he came to his chieftainship, about 1813, the Zulu people consisted of a single small tribe ; when his throne became vacant in 1828, their name had become a living terror, and they were the greatest Black power in South Africa. The invincible armies of this African Attila had swept north and south, east and west, had slaughtered more than a million human beings, and added vast tracts of country to his dominions. Wherever his warriors went, the blood of men, women, and children was poured out without stay or stint ; indeed he reigned like a visible Death, the presiding <renius of a Saturnalia of slaughter. o \u2022*-**\u2022' His methods of government and warfare were pecu liar and somewhat drastic, but most effective. As he conquered a tribe, he enrolled its remnants in his army so that they might in their turn help to conquer others., He armed his regiments with the short stabbing assegai, instead of the throwing assegai which they had been accustomed to use, and kept them subject to an iron dis cipline. If a man was observed to show the slightest hesitation about coming to close quarters with the enemy, he was executed as soon as the fight was over."], [88, "CETYWAYO 4 If a regiment had the misfortune to be defeated, whether by its own fault or not, it would on its return to head quarters find that a goodly proportion of the wives and children belonging to it bad been beaten to death by Chaka's orders, and that be was waiting their arrival to complete his vengeance by dashing out their brains. The result was, that though Chaka's armies were occa sionally annihilated, they were rarely defeated, and they never ran away. I will not enter into the history of his numerous cruelties, and indeed they are not edifying. Amongst other things, like Nero, be killed his own mother, and then caused several persons to be executed because they did not show sufficient sorrow at her death. At length, in 1828, he too suffered the fate he had meted out to so many, and was killed by his brothers, Dingaan and Umhlangan, by the bands of one Unibopa. He was murdered in bis hut, and as his life passed out of him be is reported to have addressed these words to bis brothers, who were watching his end : \" What ! do you stab me, my brothers, dogs of mine own house, whom I have fed ? You hope to be kings ; but though you do kill me, think not that your line shall reign for long. I tell you that I bear the sound of the feet of the great white people, and that this land shall be trodden by them.\" He then expired, but his last words have always been looked upon as a prophecy by the Zulus, and indeed they have been partly fulfilled. Having in his turn killed Umhlangan, bis brother by blood and in crime, Dingaan took possession of the throne. He was less pronounced than Chaka in his foreign policy, though he seems to have kept up the family reputation as regards domestic affairs. It was"], [89, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 5 he who, influenced, perhaps, by Chaka's dying prophecy about white men, massacred Eetief, the Boer leader, and his fifty followers, in the most treacherous manner, and then falling on the emigrant Boers in Natal, murdered men, women, and children to the number of nearly six hundred. There seems, however, to have been but little love lost between any of the sons of Usengangacona (the father of Chaka, Dingaan, Umhlangan, and Panda), for in due course Panda, his brother, conspired with the Boers against Dingaan, and overthrew him with their assistance. Dingaan fled, and was shortly after wards murdered in Swaziland, and Panda ascended the throne in 1840. Panda was a man of different character to the remain der of his race, and seems to have been well content to reign in peace, only killing enough people to keep up his authority. Two of his sons, Umbelazi and Cety wayo, of whom Umbelazi was the elder and Panda's favourite, began, as their father grew old, to quarrel about the succession to the crown. On the question being referred to Panda, he is reported to have remarked that when two young cocks quarrelled the best thing they could do was to fight it out. Acting on this hint, each prince collected his forces, Panda sending down one of his favourite regiments to help Umbelazi. The fight took place in 1856 on the banks of the Tugela. A friend of the writer, happening to be on the Natal side of the river the day before the battle, and knowing it was going to take place, swam his horse across in the darkness, taking his chance of the alligators, and hid in some bush on a hillock commanding the battlefield. It was a hazardous proceeding, but the sight repaid the risk, though he describes it as very awful, more espe-"], [90, "6 CETYWAYO cially when the regiment of veterans sent by Panda joined in the fray. It came up at the charge, between two and three thousand strong, and was met near his hiding-place by one of Cetywayo's young regiments. The noise of the clash of their shields was like the roar of the sea, but the old regiment, after a struggle in which men fell thick and fast, annihilated the other, and passed on with thinned ranks. Another of Cety wayo's regiments took the place of the one that had been destroyed, and this time the combat was fierce and long, till victory again declared for the veterans' spears. But they bad bought it dear, and were in no position to continue their charge ; so the leaders of that brave battalion formed its remnants into a ring, and, like the Scotch at Flodden \u2014 :'The stubborn spearmen still made good The dark, impenetrable wood ; Each stepping where his comrade stood The instant that he fell,\" till there were none left to fall. The ground around them was piled with dead. But this gallant charge availed Umbelazi but little, and by degrees Cetywayo's forces pressed his men back to the banks of the Tugela, and finally into it. Thou sands fell upon the field and thousands perished in the river. When my friend swam back that night, he had nothing to fear from the alligators : they were too well fed. Umbelazi died on the battlefield of a broken heart \u2014 at least it is said that no wound could be found on his person. He probably expired in a fit brought on by anxiety of mind and fatigue. A curious story is told of Cetywayo with reference to his brother's death."], [91, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 7 After the battle was over a Zulu from one of his own regi ments presented himself before him with many saluta tions, saying, \" 0 prince ! now canst thou sleep in peace, for Umbelazi is dead.\" \" How knowest thou that he is dead ? \" said Cetywayo. \" Because I slew him with my own hand,\" replied the Zulu. \" Thou dog ! \" said the prince, \" thou bast dared to lift thy hand against the blood royal, and now thou makest it a matter of boasting. Wast thou not afraid ? By Chaka's head thou shalt have thy reward. Lead him away.\" And the Zulu, who was but lying after all, having possessed himself of the bracelets off the dead prince's body, was instantly executed. The probability is that Cety wayo acted thus more from motives of policy than from affection to his brother, whom indeed he hoped to destroy. It did not do to make too light of the death of an important prince : Umbelazi's fate to-day might be Cetywayo's fate to-morrow. This story bears a really remarkable resemblance to that of the young man who slew Saul, the Lord's anointed, and suffered death on account thereof at the hands of David. This battle is also memorable as being the occa sion of the first public appearance of Mr. John Dunn, now the most important chief in Zululand, and, be it understood, an unknown quantity in all future trans actions in that country. At that time Dunn was a retainer of Umbelazi's, and fought on his side in the Tugela battle. After the fight, however, be went over to Cetywayo and became bis man. From that time till the outbreak of the Zulu war be remained in Zululand as adviser to Cetywayo, agent for the Natal Government, and purveyor of firearms to the nation at large. As soon as Cetywayo got into trouble with the"], [92, "8 CETYWAYO Imperial Government, Dunn, like a prudent man, de serted him and came over to us. In reward Sir Garnet Wolseley advanced him to the most important chief tainship in Zululand, which be hopes to make a stepping stone to the vacant throne. His advice was largely followed by Sir Garnet in the bestowal of the other chieftainships, and was naturally not quite disinter ested. He has already publicly announced his intention of resisting the return of the king, bis old master, by force of arms, should the Government attempt to rein state him. A period of sixteen years elapsed before Cetywayo reaped the fruits of the battle of the Tugela by succeed ing to the throne on the death of his father, Panda, the only Zulu monarch who has as yet come to his end by natural causes. In 1861, however, Cetywayo was, at the instance of the Natal Government, formally nominated heir to the throne by Mr. Shepstone, it being thought better that a fixed succession should be established with the con currence of the Natal Government than that matters should be left to take their chance on Panda's death. Mr. Shepstone accomplished his mission successfully, though at great personal risk. For some unknown reason, Cetywayo, who was blowTn up with pride, was at first adverse to being thus nominated, and came down to the royal kraal with three thousand armed followers, meaning, it would seem, to kill Mr. Shepstone, whom he had never before met. Panda, the old kino* had an inkling of what was to happen, but was power less to control his son, so he confined himself to address ing the assembled multitude in what I have heard Sir Theopbilus Shepstone say was the most eloquent"], [93, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 9 and touching speech he ever listened to, the subject being the duties of hospitality. He did not at the time know how nearly the speech concerned him, or that its object was to preserve his life. This, how- ever, soon became manifest when, exception being taken to some breach of etiquette by one of his ser- vants, he was surrounded by a mob of shouting savages, whose evident object was to put an end to him and those with him. For two hours be remained sitting there, expecting that every moment would be his last, but showing not the slightest emotion, till at length he got an opportunity of speaking, when be rose and said, \" I know that you mean to kill me ; it is an easy thing to do ; but I tell you Zulus, that for every drop of my blood that falls to the ground, a hundred men will come out of the sea yonder, from the country of which Natal is one of the cattle-kraals, and will bitterly avenge me.\" As he spoke he turned and pointed towards the ocean, and so intense was the excitement that animated it, that the whole great multitude turned with him and stared towards the horizon, as though they expected to see the long lines of avengers creep ing across the plains. Silence followed his speech ; his imperturbability and his well-timed address had saved bis life. From that day his name was a power in the land.1 1 A very good description of this scene was published in the London Quarterly Review in 1878. The following is an extract : \u2014 \" In the centre of those infuriated savages he (Mr. Shepstone) sat for more than two hours, outwardly calm, giving confidence to his solitary European companion by his own quietness, only once saying, 'Why, Jem, you're afraid,' and imposing restraint on his native at tendants. Then, when they had shouted, as Cetywayo himself said in our hearing, ' till their throats were so sore that they could shout no"], [94, "CETYWAYO 10 It was on this occasion that a curious incident occurred which afterwards became of importance. Among the Zulus there exists a certain salute, \" Bayete.\" which it is the peculiar and exclusive privilege of Zulu royalty to receive. The word means, or is supposed to mean, \" Let us bring tribute.\" On Mr. Shepstone's visit the point was raised by the Zulu lawyers as to what salute be should receive. It was not consistent with their ideas that the nominator of their future king should be greeted with any salute inferior to the Bayet<i, and this, as plain Mr. Shepstone, it was impossible to give him. The difficulty was obvious, but the Zulu mind proved equal to it. He was solemnly announced to be a Zulu king, and to stand in the place of the great founder of their nation, Chaka. Who was so fit to proclaim the successor to the throne as the great predecessor of the prince proclaimed ? To us this seems a strange, not to say ludicrous, way of settling a difficulty, but there was nothing in it repugnant to Zulu ideas. Odd as it was, it invested Mr. Shepstone with all the attri butes of a Zulu king, such as the power to make laws, order executions, &c, and those attributes in the eyes of Zulus he still retains. more,' they departed. But Sompseu (Mr. Shepstone) had conquered. Cetywayo, in describing the scene to us and our companion on a visit to him a short time afterwards, said, 'Sompseu is a great man: no man but he could have come through that day alive.' Similar testi mony we have had from some of the Zulu assailants, from the native attendants, and the companion above mentioned. Next morning Cetywayo humbly begged an interview, which was not granted but on terms of unqualified submission. From that day Cetywayo has sub mitted to British control in the measure in which it has been exercised, and has been profuse in his expressions of respect and submission to Sir T. Shepstone ; but in his heart, as occasional acts and speeches show, he writhes under the restraint, and bitterly hates the man who imposed it.\""], [95, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 11 In 1873 messengers came down from Zululand to the Natal Government, bringing with them the \" king's head,\" that is, a complimentary present of oxen, announc ing the death of Panda. \" The nation,\" they said, \" was wandering; it wanders and wanders, and wanders again;\" the spirit of the king bad departed from them ; his words had ceased, and \" none but children were left.\" The message ended with a request that Mr. Shepstone, as Cetywayo's \" father,\" should come and instal him on the throne. A month or two afterwards there came another message, again requesting his attendance ; and on the request being refused by the Lieutenant-Gover nor of Natal, there came a third message, to which the Natal Government returned a favourable answer. Accordingly Mr. Shepstone proceeded to Zululand, and on the 3d September 1873 proclaimed Cetywayo king with all due pomp and ceremony. It was on this occasion that, in the presence of, and with the enthusi astic assent of, both king and people, Mr. Shepstone, \" standing in the place of Cetywayo's father, and so representing the nation,\" enunciated the four following articles, with a view to putting an end to the continual slaughter that darkens the history of Zululand : \u2014 1. That the indiscriminate shedding of blood shall cease in the land. 2. That no Zulu shall be condemned without open trial, and the public examination of witnesses for and against, and that he shall have a right to appeal to the king. 3. That no Zulu's life shall be taken without the previous knowledge and consent of the king, after such trial has taken place, and the right of appeal has been allowed to be exercised."], [96, "CETYWAYO 12 4. That for minor crimes the loss of property, all or a portion, shall be substituted for the punishment of death. Nobody will deny that these were admirable regula tions, and that they were received as such at the time by the Zulu king and people. But there is no doubt that their ready acceptance by the king was a sacrifice to bis desire to please \" his father Sompseu \" (Air. Shepstone) and the Natal Government, with both of whom he was particularly anxious to be on good terms. He has never adhered to these coronation regulations, or promises, as they have been called, and the proba bility is that he never intended to adhere to them. However this may be, I must say that personally I have been unable to share the views of those who see in the breach of these so-called promises a justifica tion of the Zulu war. After all, what do they amount to, and what guarantee was there for their fulfilment ? They merely represent a very laudable attempt on the part of the Natal Government to keep a restraining hand on Zulu cruelty, and to draw the bonds of friend ship as tight as the idiosyncrasies of a savage state would allow. The Government of Natal had no right to dictate the terms to a Zulu king on which be was to hold his throne. The Zulu nation was an independent nation, and bad never been conquered or annexed by Natal. If the Government of that colony was able by friendly negotiation to put a stop to Zulu slaughter, it was a matter for congratulation on humanitarian grounds ; but it is difficult to follow the argument that because it was not able, or was only partially able, to do so, therefore England was justified in making war on the Zulus. On the other hand, it- is perfectly"], [97, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 13 ludicrous to observe the way in which Cetywayo's advocates overshoot the mark in arguing this and similar points ; especially his lady advocates, whose writings upon these subjects bear about the same resemblance to the truth that the speech to the jury by the counsel for the defence in a hopeless murder case does to the summing up of the judge. Having demon strated that the engagements entered into by Cetywayo meant nothing, they will proceed to show that, even if they did, cold-blooded murder, when perpetrated by a black paragon like Cetywayo, does not amount to a great offence. In the mouths of these gentle apologists for slaughter, massacre masquerades under the name of \" executions,\" and is excused on the plea of being, \" after all,\" only the enforcement of \" an old custom.\" Again, the employment of such phrases, in a solemn answer to a remonstrance from the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, as \" I do kill ; but do not consider that I have done anything yet in the way of killing. ... I have not yet begun ; I have yet to kill,\" are shown to mean nothing at all, and to be \" nothing more than the mere irritation of the moment.\" 1 Perhaps those of 1 The following is the text of the message : \u2014 \" Did I ever tell Mr. Shepstone I would not kill ? Bid he tell the white people I made such an arrangement ? Because if he did he has deceived them. I do kill ; but do not consider that I have done any thing yet in the way of killing. Why do the white people start at nothing ? I have not yet begun ; I have yet to kill ; it is the custom of our nation, and I shall not depart from it. Why does the Governor of Natal speak to me about my laws ? Do I go to Natal and dictate to him about his laws? I shall not agree to any laws or rules from Natal, and by doing so throw the large kraal which I govern into the water. My people will not listen unless they are killed ; and while wishing to be friends with the English, I do not agree to give my people over to be governed by laws sent to me by them. Have I not"], [98, "CETYWAYO 14 Cetywayo's subjects who suffered on account of this mere momentary irritation took a more serious view of it. It is but fair to the particular authoress from whom I quote (Miss Colenso's \"History of the Zulu War,\" pp. 230-2*31) to state that she considers this reply from the \" usually courteous and respectful king \" as \" no doubt petulant and wanting in due respect.\" Con sidering that the message in question (which can be read in the footnote) was a point-blank defiance of Sir Henry Bulwer, admitting that there had been slaughter, but that it was nothing compared to what was coming, most people will not think Miss Colenso's description of it too strong. To admit that -the Zulu king has the right to kill as many of his subjects as he chooses, so long as they will tolerate being killed, is one thing, but it is certainly surprising to find educated Europeans adopting a line of defence of these proceedings on bis behalf that amounts to a virtual expression of approval, or at least of easy toleration. Has philanthropy a deadening effect on the moral sense, that the people who consti tute themselves champions for the unfortunate Zulu king and the oppressed Boers cannot get on to their bobbies without becoming blind to the difference between right and wrong ? Eeally an examination of the utterances of these champions of oppressed asked the English to allow me to wash my spears since the death of my father ' Uinpandi,' aud they have kept playing with me all this time, treating me like a child ? Go back and tell the English that I shall now act on my own account, and if they wish me to agree to their laws, I shall leave and become a wanderer ; but before I go it will be seen, as I shall not go without having acted: Go back and tell the white men this, and let them hear it well. The Governor of Natal and I are equal ; he is Governor of Natal, and I am Governor here.\""], [99, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 15 innocence would almost lead one to that conclusion. On the one hand they suppress and explain away facts, and on the other supply their want of argu ment by reckless accusations and vicious attacks on the probity of such of their fellow-Englishmen, espe cially if in office, as have had the misfortune to pursue a course of action or to express opinions not pleasing to them or tbeir proteges. For instance, an innocent and unenlightened reader of the very interesting work from which I have just quoted probably lays it down with the conviction that both Sir Bartle Frere and Sir Theophilus Shepstone are very wicked men and full of bad motives, and will wonder how a civilised Government could employ such monsters of blood thirsty duplicity. As he proceeds he will also find that there is not much to be said for the characters of either Sir Garnet Wolseley or Lord Chelmsford ; whilst as regards such small fry as Mr. John Shepstone, the pre sent Secretary of Native Affairs in Natal, after passing through Miss Colenso's mill their reputations come out literally in rags and tatters. He will be shocked to find that not only did one and all of these gentlemen make gross errors of judgment, but, trusted and distinguished servants of tbeir country as they are, they were one and all actuated by dark personal motives that will not bear examination. Heaven help the members of the Shepstone family when they fall into the hands of the gentler but more enthusiastic sex, for Miss Colenso is not their only foe. In a recent publication called a \" Defence of Zululand and its Kings,\" Lady Florence Dixie gibbets Mr. Henrique Shepstone, and points him out to be execrated by a Cetywayo-worshipping public, because"], [100, "CETYWAYO 16 the ex-king is to be sent to England in his charge ; when, according to Lady Dixie, he will certainly be scoundrel enough to misinterpret all that Cetywayo says for bis own ends, and will thereby inflict a \" cruel wrong \" upon him, and render his visit to England \" per fectly meaningless.\" Perhaps it has never occurred to Lady Dixie that this is a very serious charge to bring against an honourable man, whose reputation is pro bably as dear to him as the advancement of Cetywayo's cause is to her. It is all very well to be enthusiastic, but ladies should remember that there are other people in the world to be considered beside Cetywayo. As regards the question of Cetywayo's bloodtbirsti ness, which is so strenuously denied by his apologists, I cannot say that a careful study of the blue books bearing on the subject brings me to the same conclusion. It is true that there is not much information on the point, for the obvious reason that the history of slaughters in Zululand in the vast majority of cases only reached Natal in the form of rumours, which nobody thought it worth while to report. There were no newspaper correspondents in Zululand. There is not, however, any doubt that Cetywayo was in the habit of killing large numbers of people ; indeed it was a matter of the commonest notoriety ; nor, as will be seen from the message I have transcribed, did be himself deny it, when, being angry, he spoke the truth. At the same time that this message was sent, we find Mr. Osborn, then resident magistrate at Newcastle in Natal, who is certainly not given to exaggeration, writing to the Secretary for Native Affairs thus : \u2014 \" From all I have been able to learn, Cetywayo's conduct has been, and continues to be, disgraceful. He is putting people to"], [101, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 17 death in a shameful manner, especially girls. The dead bodies are placed by his order in the principal paths, especially where the paths intersect each other (cross roads). A few of the parents of the young people so killed buried the bodies, and thus brought Cetywayo's wrath on themselves, resulting not only in their own death, but destruction to the whole family. . . . It is really terrible that such horrible savagery could take place on our own borders. . . . Uhamu reproved Cetywayo the other day, reminded him of his promises to Mr. Shepstone, and begged him to spare the people. This advice, as could be expected, was not relished.\" Again, Mr. Fynney, in his report of his visit to Zululand in 1877, states that though the king and his \" indunas \" (councillors) denied that men were killed without trial, the people told a very different tale. Thus be says, \" In every instance, where I had so far sained the confidence of the Zulus as to cause them to speak freely, was I assured of the truthfulness of the statement that the king, Cetywayo, caused his people to be put to death in great numbers ; and when I remarked that of course he did so after a fair and proper trial, in some cases my remark was greeted with a suppressed laugh or a smile. Some remarked, ' Yes, a trial of bullets ; ' others, ' Yes, we get a trial, but that means surrounding the kraal at daybreak and shooting us down like cattle.' One asked me what the Govern- ment in Natal intended doing, or what was thought in Natal about the killing, saying, ' It was not in the night that Sompseu spoke, but in the sunshine ; the king was not alone, but bis people were around him, and the ears of all Zululand heard these words, and the hearts of all B"], [102, "CETYWAYO 18 Zulus were joyful, and in gladness they lifted up their hands saying: The mouth of our white father has spoken good words ; he has cautioned bis child in the presence of his people, and a good sun has risen this day over Zululand ! How is it now ? Has the king listened ? Does he hold fast those words ? No ! not one. The promises he made are all broken. What does Sompseu say to this ? You should dine at my kraal yonder for a few days, and see the izizi (cattle and other property of people who have been killed) pass, and you would then see with your own eyes bow a case is tried.' \" Farther on Mr. Fynney says, \"When a charge is made against a Zulu, the question is generally asked, ' Has he any cattle ? ' and if answered in the affirmative, there is little chance of escape. Instances of killing occurred while I was in Zululand, and to my know ledge no trial was allowed. An armed party was despatched on the morning I left Ondine, and, as I was informed, to kill.\" There is no reason to suppose that Mr. Fynney was in any way prejudiced in making these remarks ; on the contrary, he was simply carrying out an official mission, and reporting for the general information of the Govern ments of Natal and the Transvaal. It is, however, noticeable that neither these nor similar passages are ever alluded to by Cetywayo's advocates, whose object seems to be rather to suppress the truth than to put it fairly before the public, if by such suppression they think they can advance the cause of the ex-king. The whole matter of Cetywayo's private policy, however, appears to me to be very much beside the question. Whether or no he slaughtered his oppressed subjects in bygone years, which there is no doubt he"], [103, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 19 did, is not our affair, since we were not then, as we are now, responsible for the good government of Zululand ; and seeing the amount of slaughter that goes on under our protectorate, it ill becomes us to rake up these things against Cetywayo. What we have to consider is his foreign policy, not the domestic details of his government.1 1 A gentleman, who has recently returned from travelling in Zulu- land, relates the following story as nearly as possible in the words in which it was told him by a well-known hunter in Zululand, Piet Hogg by name, now residing near Dundee, on the Zulu border. The story is a curious one as illustrative of Zulu character, and scarcely represents Cetywayo in as amiable a light as one might wish. Piet Hogg and my informant were one day talking about the king when the former said, \" I was hunting and trading in Zululand, and was at a military kraal occupied by Cetywayo, where I saw a Basuto who had been engaged by the king to instruct his people in building houses, that were to be square instead of circular (as are all Zulu buildings), for which his pay was to be thirty head of cattle. The Basuto came to Cetywayo in my presence, and said that the square buildings were made ; he now wished to have his thirty head of cattle and to depart. Cetywayo having obtained what he required, began to think the man overpaid, so said, ' I have observed that you like (a Zulu woman belonging to the kraal) ; suppose you take her instead of the thirty head of cattle.' Now this was a very bad bargain for the Basuto, as the woman was not worth more, in Zulu estimation, than ten head of cattle ; but the Basuto, knowing with whom he had to deal, thought it might be better to comply with the suggestion rather than insist upon his rights, and asked to be allowed till the next morning to con- sider the proposal. After he had been dismissed on this understanding, Cetywayo sent for the woman, and accused her of misconduct with the Basuto, the punishment of which, if proved, would be death. She denied this vehemently, with protestations and tears. He insisted, but, looking up at a tree almost denuded of leaves which grew close by, said, significantly, ' Take care that not a leaf remains on that tree by the morning.' The woman understood the metaphor, and in an hour or two, aided by other strapping Zulu females, attacked the un fortunate Basuto and killed him with clubs. But Cetywayo having thus, like the monkey in the fable, employed a cat's paw to do his"], [104, "CETYWAYO 20 I do not propose to follow out all the details of the boundary dispute between Cetywayo and the Trans vaal, or to comment on the different opinions held on the point by the various authorities, English and Zulu. The question has been, for the moment, settled by the Transvaal Convention, and is besides a most uninteresting one to the general reader. Nor shall I enter into a discussion concerning the outrages on which Sir Bartle Frere based his ultimatum previous to the Zulu war. They were after all insignifi cant, although sufficient to serve as a casus belli to a statesman determined to fight. The Zulu war was, in the opinion of Sir Bartle Frere, necessary in self-defence, which is the first principle of existence. If it admits of justification, it is on the ground that the Zulu army was a menace to the white population of South Africa, and that it was therefore necessary to destroy it, lest at some future time it should destroy the whites. It is ridiculous to say that the capture of two Zulu women in Natal and their subsequent murder, or the expulsion on political grounds of a few missionaries, justified us in breaking up a kingdom and slaughtering ten thousand men. Sir Bartle Frere declared war upon the Zulus because he was afraid, and had good reason to be afraid, dirty work, began to think the Basuto's untimely death might have an ugly appearance in my eyes, so gave orders in my presence that, as a punishment, six of the -women who had killed the Basuto should also be put to death. This was too much for me, knowing, as I did, all that had passed. I reproached Cetywayo for his cruelty, and declared I would leave Zululand without trading there, and without makinc him the present he expected. I also said I should take care the great English ' Inkose ' (the Governor of Natal) should hear of his conduct and the reason of my return. Cetywayo was then on friendly terms with the English, and being impressed by my threats, he recon sidered his orders, and spared the lives of the women.\""], [105, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 21 that, if he did not, Cetywayo would before long sweep either the Transvaal or Natal ; whilst, on the other hand, the Zulus fought us because our policy was too philanthropic to allow them to fight anybody else. This statement may appear strange, but a little exami nation into Zulu character and circumstances will, I think, show it to be correct. It must be remembered that for some years before Panda's death the Zulus had not been engaged in any foreign war. When Cetywayo ascended the throne, it was the general hope and expectation of the army, and there fore of the nation, that this period of inaction would come to an end, and that the new king would inaugu rate an active foreign policy. They did not greatly care in what direction the activity developed itself, pro vided it did develop. It must also be borne in mind that every able-bodied man in the Zulu country was a member of a regiment, even the lads being attached to regiments as carriers, and the women being similarly enrolled, though they did not fight. The Zulu military system was the universal-service system of Germany brought to an absolute perfection, obtained by subordi nating all the ties and duties of civil life to military ends. Thus, for instance, marriage could not be con tracted at will, but only by the permission of the king, which was generally delayed until a regiment was well advanced in years, when a number of girls were handed over to it to take to wife. This regulation came into force because it was found that men without home ties were more ferocious and made better soldiers, and the result of these harsh rules was that the Zulu warrior, living as he did under the shadow of a savage discipline, for any breach of which there was but one punishment,"], [106, "CETYWAYO 22 death, can hardly be said to have led a life of domestic com fort, such as men of all times and nations have thought their common right. But even a Zulu must have some object in life, some shrine at which to worship, some mistress of bis affections. Home he had none, religion be had none, mistress he had none, but in their stead he had bis career as a warrior, and his hope of honour and riches to be gained by the assegai. His home was on the war-track with bis regiment, his religion the fierce denunciation of the isanusi,1 and bis affections were fixed on the sudden rush of battle, the red slaughter, and the spoils of the slain. \" War,\" says Sir T. Shepstone, in a very remarkable despatch written about a year be fore the outbreak of the Zulu war, \"is the universal cry 1 Witch-doctor. These persons are largely employed in Zululand to smell out witches who are supposed to have bewitched others, and are of course very useful as political agents. Any person denounced by them is at once executed. A friend of the writer's was once present at a political smelling-out on a large scale, and describes it as a very curious and unpleasant scene. The men, of whom there were some thousands, were seated in a circle, as pale with terror as Zulus can be. Within the circle were several witch doctors ; one of whom amidst his or her incantations would now and again step forward and touch some unfortunate man with a forked stick. The victim was instantly led away a few paces and his neck twisted. The circle awaited each de nunciation in breathless expectation, for not a man among them knew whose turn it might be next. On another occasion, an unfortunate wretch who had been similarly condemned by an isanusi rushed up to the same gentleman's waggon and besought shelter. He was hidden under some blankets, but presently his pursuers arrived, and insisted upon his being handed over. All possible resistance was made, until the executioners announced that they would search the wa\u00bb\u00bbon and kill him there. It was then covenanted that he should have a start in the race for life. He was, however, overtaken and killed. These in stances will show how dark and terrible is the Zulu superstition con nected with witchcraft, and what a formidable weapon it becomes iu the hands of the king or chief."], [107, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 23 among the soldiers, who are anxious to live up to their traditions, .... and the idea is gaining ground among the people that their nation has outlived the object of its existence.\" Again be says, \" The engine (the Zulu military organisation) has not ceased to exist or to generate its forces, although the reason or excuse for its existence has died away : these forces have con tinued to accumulate and are daily accumulating with out safety-valve or outlet.\" Desirable as such a state of feeling may be in an army just leaving for the battlefield, it is obvious that for some fifty thousand men, comprising the whole manhood of the nation, to be continually on the boil with sanguinary animosity against the human race in general, is an awkward element to fit into the peaceable government of a state. Yet this was doubtless the state of affairs with which Cetywayo had to contend during the latter years of his reign. He found himself surrounded by a great army, in a high state of efficiency and warlike preparation, proclaiming itself wearied with camp life, and clamour ing to be led against an enemy, that it might justify its traditions and find employment for its spears. Often and often be must have been sorely puzzled to find excuses wherewithal to put it off. Indeed his position was both awkward and dangerous : on the one hand was Scylla in the shape of the English Government, and on the other the stormy and uncertain Charybdis of bis clamouring regiments. Slowly the idea must have began to dawn upon him that unless lie found employment for the army, which, besides being dis gusted with bis inactivity, was somewhat wearied with bis cruelties, for domestic slaughter bad ceased to divert"], [108, "CETYWAYO 24 and had begun to irritate, the army, or some enter prising members of it, might put it beyond his power ever to find employment for it at all, and bring one of his brothers to rule in his stead. And yet who was he to fight, if fight be must? There were three possible enemies \u2014 i. The Swazis. 2. The Transvaal Boers. 3. The English. Although the English may have held a place on Cetywayo's list as possible foes, there is no ground for supposing that, until shortly before the war, be had any wish to fight with us. Indeed, whereas their hatred of the Boers was pronounced, and openly ex pressed, both the Zulu king and people always pro fessed great respect for Englishmen, and even a certain amount of liking and regard. Therefore, when Cetywayo bad to settle on an enemy to attack, it was not the English that be chose, but the Swazis, whose territory adjoined bis own, lying along the borders of the Transvaal towards Delagoa Bay. The Swazis are themselves Zulus, and Cetywayo claimed certain sovereign rights over them, which, however, they refused to recognise. They are a power ful tribe, and can turn out about 10,000 fighting men, quite enough for Cetywayo's young warriors to try their mettle on. Still the king does not appear to have wished to undertake the war without first obtaining the approval of the Natal Government, to whom he applied several times for permission \"to wash bis spears,\" saying that he was but half a king until be had done so. The Natal Government, bow ever, invariably replied that be was on no account to do anything of the sort. This shows the inconveniences of possessing a complimentary feudal hold over a savage"], [109, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 25 potentate, the shadow of power without the reality. The Governor of Natal could not in decency sanction such a proceeding as a war of extermination against the Swazis, but if it had occurred without his sanction, the Swazis would have suffered no doubt, but the Zulu spears would have been satisfactorily washed, and there would have been no Zulu war. As it is, Englishmen have been killed instead of Swazis. Thwarted in bis designs on the Swazis, Cetywayo next turned his attention to the Transvaal Boers. The Zulus and the Boers had never been good friends since the days of the massacre of Betief, and of late years their mutual animosity had been greatly increased owing to their quarrels about the boundary question previously alluded to. This animosity reached blood- beat when the Boer Government, acting with the arro- gance it always displayed towards natives, began to lay its commands upon Cetywayo about his relations with the Amaswazi, the alleged trespassing on Boer territory, and other matters. The arrogance was all the more offensive because it was impotent*. The Boers were not in a position to undertake the chastisement of the Zulus. But the king and council of Zululand now determined to try conclusions with the Transvaal on the first convenient opportunity, and this time without consulting the Government of Natal. The opportunity soon occurred. Secoc\u0153ni, the powerful chief of the Bapedi, one of the tribes whose territories border on the Transvaal, came to a difference with the Boers over another border question. There is good ground for supposing that Cetywayo incited him to withstand the Boer demands; it is certain that during the course of"], [110, "26 CETYWAYO the war that followed be assisted him with advice, and more substantially still, with Zulu volunteers. To be brief, the Secoc\u0153ni war resulted in the discom fiture of the Transvaal forces. Another result of the struggle was to throw the whole state into the most utter confusion, of which the Dutch burghers, always glad of an opportunity to defy the law, took advantage to refuse to pay taxes. National bankruptcy ensued, and confusion grew worse confounded. Cetywayo took note of all this, and saw that now was his opportunity to attack. The Boers had suffered both in morale and prestige from tbeir defeat by Secoc\u0153ni, who was stdl in arms against them ; whilst the natives were proportionately elated by tbeir success over the dreaded white men. There was, be knew well, but little chance of a rapid concentration to resist a sudden raid, especially when made by such a powerful army, or rather chain of armies, as he could set in motion. Everything favoured the undertaking ; indeed, humanly speaking, it is difficult to see what could have saved the greater part of the population of the Transvaal from sudden extinction, if a kind Providence bad not just then put it into the head of Lord Carnarvon to send out Sir T. Shepstone as Special Commissioner to tbeir country. When Cetywayo heard that bis father Sompseu (Sir T. Shepstone) was going up to the Transvaal, he held his hand, sent out spies, and awaited the course of events. The following incident will show with what interest he was watching what took place. At the Vaal Eiver a party of Boers met the Special Commissioner and fired salutes to welcome him. It was immediately reported to Cetywayo by bis spies that the Boers had fired over Sir T. Shepstone's waggon."], [111, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 27 Shortly afterwards a message arrived at Pretoria from Cetywayo to inquire into the truth of the story, coolly announcing bis intention of sweeping the Transvaal if it were true that \" his father \" bad been fired at. In a conversation with Mr. Fynney after the Annexation, Cetywayo alludes to bis intentions in these words : \u2014 \" I beard that the Boers were not treating him (Sompseu) properly, and that they intended to put him in a corner. If they had done so I should not have waited for anything more. Had but one shot been fired, I should have said, \" What more do I wait for \u25a0? they have touched my father.\" I should have poured my men over the land, and I can tell you, son of Mr. Fynney, the land would have burned with fire.\" This will show how eagerly Cetywayo was searching for an excuse to commence his attack on the Transvaal. When the hope of finding a pretext in the supposed firing at Sir T. Shepstone or any incident of a similar nature faded . away, he appears to have determined to carry out bis plans without any immediate pretext, and to make a casus belli of bis previous differences with the Government of the Bepublic. Accordingly he massed his impis (army corps) at different points along the Transvaal border, where they awaited the signal to advance and sweep the country. Information of Cety wayo's doings and of bis secret plans reached Pretoria shortly before the Annexation, and confirmed the mind of the Special Commissioner as to the absolute necessity of that measure to save the citizens of the Republic from coming to a violent end, and South Africa from being plunged into a native war of unexampled magni tude. The day before the Annexation took place, when it was quite certain that it would take place, a message"], [112, "CETYWAYO 28 was sent to Cetywayo by Sir T. Shepstone telling him of what was about to happen, and telling him too in the sternest and most straightforward language, that the Transvaal had become the Queen's land like Natal, and that be must no more think of attacking it than he would of attacking Natal. Cetywayo on receiving the message at once disbanded his armies and sent them to tbeir kraals. \" Kabana,\" be said to the messenger, \" my impis were gathered ; now at my father's (Sir T. Shepstone's) bidding I send them back to their homes.\" This fact, namely, that at the bidding of bis old mentor, Sir T. Shepstone, Cetywayo abandoned his long-cherished plans, and bis undoubted opportunity of paying off old scores with the Boers in a most effectual manner, and gave up a policy that had so many charms for him, must be held by every unpre judiced man to speak volumes in his favour. It must be remembered that it was not merely to oblige his \"father Sompseu\" that he did this, but to meet the wishes of the English Government, and the act shows how anxious be was to retain the friendship and fall in with the views of that Government. Evidently Cetywayo bad no animosity against us in April 1877. In his interview with Mr. Fynney, Cetywayro speaks out quite frankly as to what his intentions had been. He says, \" I knew all about the soldiers being on their way up, but I would have asked Sompseu to allow the soldiers to stand on one side for just a little while, only a little, and see what my men could do. It would have been unnecessary for the Queen's people to trouble. My men were all ready, and bow big must that stone have been, with my father Sompseu digging at one side and myself at the other, that would not have toppled"], [113, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 29 over ? Even though the size of that mountain (pointing to a mountain range), we could put it on its back. Again I say I am glad to know the Transvaal is English ground ; perhaps now there may be rest.\" This and other passages show beyond all doubt from what an awful catastrophe the Transvaal was saved by the Annexation. That Cetywayo personally detested the Boers is made clear by bis words to Mr. Fynney. \" ' The Boers,' he says, ' are a nation of liars ; they are a bad people, bad altogether. I do not want them near my people ; they lie and claim what is not theirs, and ill-use my people. Where is Thomas ? ' (President Burgers). I informed him that Mr. Burgers had left the Transvaal. 'Then let them pack up and follow Thomas,' said he. ' Let them go. The Queen does not want such people as those about her land. What can the Queen make of them or do with them ? Their evil ways puzzled both Thomas and Budolph, Landdrost of Utrecht ; they will not be quiet.' \" It is very clear that if Cetywayo bad been left to work bis will, a great many of the Boers would have found it necessary to \"pack up and follow Thomas,\" whilst many more would have never needed to pack again. I am aware that attempts have been made to put another explanation on Cetywayo's warlike prepara tions against the Boers. It has been said that the Zulu army was called up by Sir T. Shepstone to coerce the Transvaal. It is satisfactory to be able, from intimate personal knowledge, to give unqualified denial to that statement, which is a pure invention, as indeed is easily proved by clear evidence, which I have entered into in another part of this book. Cetywayo played for"], [114, "CETYWAYO 30 his own hand all along, and received neither commands nor hints from the Special Commissioner to get bis army together. Indeed, when Sir T. Shepstone discovered what was going on, be suffered great anxiety lest some catastrophe should occur before he was in a position to prevent it. Nothing short of the Annexation could have saved the Transvaal at that moment, and the conduct of the Boers after the danger bad been taken on to the shoulders of the Imperial Government is a startling instance of national ingratitude. Here again then the Zulu king was brought face to face with the ubiquitous British Government, and that too at a particularly aggravating moment. He was about to commence his attack when be was met with a polite, \"Hands off; this is British territory.\" No wonder that we find him in despair renewing his prayer that Sompseu will allow him to make \"one little raid only, one small swoop,\" and saying that \"it is the custom of our country, when a new king is placed over the nation, to wash their spears, and it has been done in the case of all former kings of Zululand. I am no king, but sit in a heap. I cannot be a king till I have washed my assegais.\" All of which is doubtless very savage and very wrong, but such is the depravity of human nature, that there is something taking about it for all that. It was at this period of the history of South Africa that many people think we made our crowning mistake. We annexed the Transvaal, say they, six months too soon. As things have turned out, it would have been wiser to have left Zulus and Transvaal Boers to try conclusions, and done our best to guard our own frontiers. There is no doubt that such a consumma-"], [115, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 31 tion of affairs would have cleared the political atmos phere wonderfully ; the Zulus would have got enough fighting to last them some time, and the remainder of the Boers would have entreated our protection and become contented British subjects ; there would have been no Isandhlwana and no Majuba Hill. But to these I say, who could foresee the future, and who, in the then state of kindly feeling towards the Boers, could wish to leave them, and all the English mixed up with them, to undergo, unprepared as they were, the terrible experience of a Zulu invasion ? Besides, what guar antee was there that the slaughter would stop in the Transvaal, or that the combat would not have developed into a war of races throughout South Africa ? Even looking at the matter in the light of after events, it is difficult to regret that humanity was on this occasion allowed to take precedence of a more cold-blooded policy. If the opponents of the Annexation, or even the members of the Transvaal Independence Committee, knew what a Zulu invasion meant, they would scarcely have been so bitter about that act. From the time of the Annexation it was a mere matter of opinion as to which direction the Zulu ex plosion would take. The safety-valves were loaded whilst the pressure daily increased, and all acquainted with the people knew that it must come sooner or later. Shortly after the Transvaal became British territory the old Zulu boundary question came to the fore again, and was made more complicated than ever by Sir T. Shepstone, who had hitherto favoured the Zulu claims, taking the Boer side of the controversy, after examina tion of the locality and of persons acquainted with the"], [116, "CETYWAYO 32 details of the matter. There was nothing wonderful in this change of opinion, though of course it was attri buted to various motives by advocates of the Zulu claims, and there is no doubt that Cetywayo himself did not at all like it, and, excited thereto by vexation and the outcry of bis regiments, adopted a very different and aggressive tone in bis communications with the English authorities. Indeed his irritation against the Boers and everybody connected with them was very great. Probably if be bad been left alone be would in time have carried out his old programme, and attacked the Transvaal. But, fortunately for the Transvaal, which, like sailors and drunken men, always seems to have had a special Providence taking care of it, at this juncture Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene, and after a few preliminaries and the presentation of a strong ultimatum, which was quite impracticable so far as Cetywayo was concerned, since it demanded what it was almost impossible for him to concede \u2014 the disband ment of bis army \u2014 invaded Zululand. It is generally supposed that the Natal colonists bad a great deal to do with making the Zulu war, but this is not the case. It is quite true that the/were rejoiced at the prospect of the break-up of Cetywayo's power, be cause they were very much afraid of him and of his \"celi bate manslaying machine,\" which, under all the circum stances, is not wonderful. But the war was a distinctly Imperial war, made by an Imperial officer, without consultation with Colonial authorities, on Imperial grounds, viz., because Cetywayo menaced Her Majesty's power in South Africa. Of course, if there had been no colonies there would have been no war, but in that way only are they responsible for it. Natal, however,"], [117, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 33 has not grudged to pay \u00a3250,000 towards its expenses, which is a great deal more than it can afford, and, considering that the strange settlement made by Sir Garnet Wolseley is almost sure to involve the colony in trouble, quite as much as should be asked. The fact of the matter was, that Sir Bartle Frere was a statesman who bad the courage of his convictions ; he saw that a Zulu disturbance of one kind or another was inevitable, so he boldly took the initiative. If things had gone right with him, as he supposed they would, praise would have been lavished on him by the Home authorities, and he would have been made a peer, and perhaps Governor-General of India to boot; but he reckoned without his Lord Cbelmsford, aud the element of success which was necessary to gild his policy in the eyes of the home public was conspicuous by its absence. As it was, no language was considered to be too bad to apply to this \" imperious proconsul \" who had taken upon himself to declare a war. If it is any consolation to him, he has at any rate the gratitude of the South African Colonies, not so much for what be has done, for that is being carefully nullified by the subsequent action of the Home Government, but because, believing his policy to be right, be had the boldness to carry it out at the risk of his official reputation. Sir Bartle Frere, rightly or wrongly, took a larger view of the duties of the governor of a great dependency than to constitute himself the flickering shadow of the Secre tary of State in Downing Street, who, kuowing little of the real interests of the colony, is himself only the reflection of those that hold the balance of power, to whom the subject is one of entire indifference, provided that there is nothing to pay. c"], [118, "CETYWAYO 34 The details of the Zulu war are matters of melancholy history, which it is useless to recapitulate here. With the exception of the affair at Eorke's Drift, there is nothing to be proud of in connection with it, and a great deal to be ashamed of, more especially its final settlement. There is, however, one point that I wish to submit to the consideration of my readers, and that is, that Cetywayo was never thoroughly in earnest about the war. If he had been in earnest, if he bad determined to put out bis full strength, be would certainly have swept Natal from end to end after bis victory at Isandhlwana. There was no force to prevent bis doing so : on the contrary, it is probable that if be had advanced a strong army over the border, a great number of the Natal natives would have de clared in his favour through fear of bis vengeance, or at the least would have remained neutral. He had ample time at bis disposal to have executed the man\u0153uvre twice over before the arrival of the rein forcements, of which the results must have been very dreadful, and yet be never destroyed a single family. The reason be has himself given for this conduct is that be did not wish to irritate the white man ; that be bad not made the war, and was only anxious to defend his country. When the fighting came to an end after the battle of Ulundi, there were two apparent courses open to us to take. One was to take over the country and rule it for the benefit of the Zulus, and the other to enforce the demands in Sir Bartle Frere's ultimatum, and, taking such guarantees as circumstances would admit of, leave Cetywayo on the throne. Instead of acting on either of these plans, however, Sir Garnet Wolseley"], [119, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 35 proceeded, in the face of an extraordinary consensus of adverse opinion, which he treated with calm con tempt, to execute what has proved to be a very cruel settlement. Sir Garnet Wolseley has the reputation of being an extremely able man, and it is only fair to him to suppose that he was not the parent of this political monster, by which all the blood and treasure expended on the Zulu war were made of no account, but that it was dictated to him by authorities at home, who were anxious to gratify English opinion, and partly ignorant, partly careless of the consequences. At tbe same time, it is clear that he is responsible for the details of tbe scheme, since immediately after the capture of Cetywayo he writes a despatch about them which was considered so important, that a member of his staff was sent to England in charge of it. In this document be informs the Secretary of State that Cetywayo's rule was resolutely built up \" without any of the ordinary and lawful foundations of authority, and by the mere vigour and vitality of an individual character.\" It is difficult to understand what Sir Garnet means in this passage. If tbe fact of being the right ful and generally accepted occupant of the throne is not an \"ordinary and lawful foundation of authority,\" wdiat is ? As regards Cetywayo having built up bis rule by the \" mere vigour and vitality of an individual character,\" he is surely in error. Cetywayo's position was not different to that of bis immediate predecessors. If Sir Garnet bad applied the remark to Chaka, tbe first king, to the vigour and vitality of whose individual character Zululand owes its existence as a nation, it would have been more appropriate. The despatch goes on to announce that he has made up his mind to divide"], [120, "36 CETYWAYO tbe country into thirteen portions, in order to prevent the \" possibility of any reunion of its inhabitants under one rule,\" and ends in these words : \" I have laboured with the great aim of establishing for Her Majesty's subjects in South Africa, both white and coloured, as well as for this spirited people against whom unhappily we have been involved in war, tbe enduring founda tions of peace, happiness, and prosperity.\" The spirited people were no doubt vastly thankful, but the white man, reading such a passage as this, and knowing tbe facts of the case, will only recognise Sir Garnet Wolseley's admirable talent for ironical writing. Sir Garnet entered into an agreement with each of bis kinglets, who, amongst other things, promised that they would not make war without tbe sanction of the British Government. He also issued a paper of instruc tions to tbe gentleman who was first appointed British Besident (who, by the way, very soon threw up bis post in despair). From this document we learn that all the ex-king's brothers are to \" be under the eye of the chief John Dunn,\" but it is chiefly remarkable for the hostility it evinces to all missionary enterprise. Tbe Besident is instructed to \" be careful to bold your self entirely aloof from all missionary or proselytising enterprises,\" and that \"grants of land by former kings to missionaries cannot be recognised by tbe British Government,\" although Sir Garnet will allow mission aries to live in the country if the chief of the district does not object. These instructions created some adverse comment in England, with tbe result that, in the supplementary instructions issued on the occasion of Mr. Osborn's appointment as Besident, they were somewhat modified. In the despatch to the Secretary"], [121, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 37 of State in which he announces the new appointment, Sir Garnet says that Mr. Osborn is to be the \" coun cillor, guide, and friend \" of the native chiefs, and that to bis \" moral influence \" \" we should look I think for the spread of civilisation and the propagation of the Gospel.\" What a conglomeration of duties, \u2014 at once \"prophet, priest, and king!\" Poor Mr. Osborn ! Of the chiefs appointed under this unfortunate settle ment, some were so carelessly chosen that they have no authority whatsoever over tbe districts to which they were appointed, tbeir nominal subjects preferring to remain under the leadership of their hereditary chief. Several of Sir Garnet's little kings cannot turn out an hundred men, whilst tbe hereditary chief, who has no official authority, can bring up three or four thousand. Thus, for instance, a territory was given to a chief called Infaneulela. The retainers of this gentleman live in a kraal of five or six huts on the battlefield of Ulundi. A chief called Dilligane, to whom tbe district should have been given, is practically bead man of the district, and takes every possible opportunity of defying the nominee chief, Infaneulela, who is not acknowdedged by the people. Another case is that of Umgitcbwa, to whom a territory was given. In this instance there are two brothers, Umgitchwa and Somblolo, born of dif ferent mothers. Umgitcbwa is tbe elder, but Somblolo is ktbe son of a daughter of the king,|and therefore, according to Zulu custom, entitled to succeed to the chieftainship. Somblolo was disinherited by Sir Garnet on account of bis youth (he is about twenty-five, and has many wives). But an ancient custom is not to be thus abrogated by a stroke of the pen, and Somblolo"], [122, "CETYWAYO 38 is practically chief of the district. Fighting is imminent between tbe two brothers. A third case is that of Hlubi, who, though a good, well-meaning man, is a Basuto, and being a foreigner, has no influence over the Zulus under him. A fourth instance is that of Umlandela, an old and infirm Zulu, who was made chief over a la.rge proportion of the Umtetwa tribe on the coast of Zululand. His appointment was a fatal mistake, and has already led to much bloodshed under the following curious cir cumstances, which are not without interest, as showing the intricacy of Zulu plots. The Umtetwas were in the days of Chaka a very powerful tribe, but suffered the same fate at his hands as did every other that ventured to cross spears with him. They were partially annihilated, and whilst some of the survivors, of whom tbe Umtetwas in Zululand are the descendants, were embodied in the Zulu regi ments, others were scattered far and wide. Branches of this important tribe exist as far off as the Cape Colony. Dingiswayo, who was the chief of the Umtetwas when Chaka conquered the tribe, fled after his defeat into Basutoland, and is supposed to have died there. After tbe Zulu war Sir G. Wolseley divided the Umtetwa into two districts, appointing an Umtetwa chief named Somkeli ruler over one, and Umlandela over the other. Umlandela, being a Zulu and worn with age, has never had any authority over bis nominal subjects, and has been anxious to rid himself of the danger and responsibility of bis chieftainship by transferring it on to the shoulders of Mr. John Dunn, whose territory adjoins bis own, and who would be, needless to say, nothing loth to avail himself of the opportunity of"], [123, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 39 increasing his taxable area. Whilst this intrigue was in progress all Zululand was convulsed with the news of our defeats by the Boers and the consequent surren der of the Transvaal. It was commonly rumoured that our forces were utterly destroyed, and that the Boers were now the dominant Power. Following on the heels of this intelligence was a rumour to the effect that Cetywayo was coming back. These two reports, both of which had a foundation of truth, had a very bad effect on the vulgar mind in Zululand, and resulted in the setting in motion of a variety of plots, of which the following was the most important. The Umtetwa tribe is among those who are not anxious for tbe return of Cetywayo, but see in the present state of affairs an opportunity of regaining tbe power they possessed before the days of Chaka. If they were to have a king over Zululand they de termined that it should be an Umtetwa king, and Somkeli, one of the chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet, was the man who aimed at the throne. He was not, however, anxious to put out bis hand at first further than he could draw it back, so be adopted a very ingenious expedient. It will be remembered that the old chief Dingiswayo fled to Basutoland, where he is reported to have married. It occurred to Somkeli that if he could produce a descendant or a pseudo-descendant of Dingiswayo he would have no difficulty in beginning operations by dispossessing* Umlandela of his territory in favour of the supposed lawful heir. In fact be wanted a cat to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him, who could easily be got rid of afterwards. Accordingly one Sitimela was produced, who is sup posed to be an escaped convict from Natal, who gave"], [124, "CETYWAYO 40 out that be was a grandson of Dingiswayo by a Basuto woman, aud a great medicine-man, able to kill every body by a glance of his eye. To this impostor adherents flocked from all parts of Zululand, and Umlandela flying for bis life into John Dunn's territory, Sitimela seized upon the chieftainship. The Besident thereupon ordered him to appear before him, but he, as might be expected, refused to come. As it was positively necessary to put an end to the plot by some means, since its further development would have endangered and perhaps destroyed tbe weak-knee'd Zulu settlement, Mr. Osborn determined to proceed to the scene of action. Mahomet would not go to the mountain, so the mountain bad to go to Mahomet. On arrival he pitched bis tents half way between tbe camps of Sitimela and John Dunn, wbo bad Umlandela under bis charge, and summoned Somkeli, tbe author of tbe plot, to appear before him. Ten days elapsed before the summons was obeyed. During this time, and indeed until they finally escaped, the Besident and bis companion could not even venture to tbe spring, which was close at hand, to wash, for fear of being assassinated. All day long they could see lines of armed men swarming over tbe bills round them, and hear them yelling their war-songs. At length Somkeli appeared, accompanied by over a thousand armed warriors. He was ordered to with draw bis forces from Sitimela's army and go home. He went home, but did not withdraw bis forces. The next day Sitimela himself appeared before tbe Besident. He was ordered to come with ten men : he came with two thousand all armed, wild with excitement and \" moutied \" (medicined). To make this medicine they"], [125, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 41 had killed and pounded up a little cripple boy and several of Umlandela's wives. It afterwards trans pired'that the only reason Sitimela did not then and there kill the Besident was that be (Mr. Osborn) bad with him several chiefs who were secretly favourable to Sitimela's cause, and if be bad killed him he would, according to Zulu custom, have bad to kill them too. Mr. Osborn ordered Sitimela to disperse his forces or take the consequences, and waited a few days for him to do so; but seeing no signs of his compliance, he then ordered the neighbouring chiefs to fall on him, and at length withdrew from bis encampment, \u2014 none too soon. That very night a party of Sitimela's men came down to kill him, and finding the tent in which he and his companion bad slept standing, stabbed at its supposed occupants through the canvas. Sitimela was defeated by the forces ordered out by the Besident, with a loss of about 500 men. It is, however, worthy of note, and shows bow widespread was the conspiracy, that out of all the thousands promised, Mr. Osborn was only able to call out two thousand men. Tbe appointment, however, that has occasioned the most criticism is that of John Dunn, who got the Benjamin share of Zululand in preference to his brother chiefs. The converting of an Englishman into a Zulu chief is such a very odd proceeding that it is difficult to know what to think of it. John Dunn is an ambitious man, and most probably has designs on the throne ; he is also a man who understands the value of money, of which be makes a great deal out of bis chieftainship. At tbe same time, it is clear that, so far as it goes, bis rule is better than that of the other"], [126, "CETYWAYO 42 chiefs; be. has a uniform tax fixed, and has even done something in the way of starting schools and making roads. From all that I have been able to gather, his popularity and influence with tbe Zulus are overrated, though he has lived amongst them so many years, and taken so many of their women to wife. His appoint ment was a hazardous experiment, and in tbe long run is likely to prove a mischievous one, since any attempted amendment of the settlement will be violently resisted by him on the ground of vested interests. Also, if white men are set over Zulus at all, they should be gentlemen in tbe position of government officers, not successful adventurers. Berhaps tbe only wise thing done in connection with tbe settlement was the appointment of Mr. Osborn, C.M.G., as British Besident. It is not easy to find a man fitted for that difficult and dangerous position, for the proper filling of which many qualifications are required. Possessed of an intimate knowledge of tbe Zulus, their language, and their mode of thought and life, and being besides a very able and energetic officer, Mr. Osborn would have saved the settlement from breaking down if anybody could have saved it. As it is, by the exercise of ceaseless energy and at great personal risk, he has preserved it from total collapse. Of the dangers and anxieties to which he is exposed, the account I have given of the Sitimela incident is a sufficient sample. He is, in fact, nothing but a shadow, for be has no force at his command to insure obedience to bis decisions, or to prevent civil war ; and in Zulu land, oddly enough, force is a remedy. Should one chief threaten the peace of the country, he can only deal with him by calling on another chief for aid, a"], [127, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 43 position that is neither dignified nor right. What is Avorst of all is that the Zulus are beginning to discover what a shadow he is, and with this weakened position be has to pit bis single brains against all the thousand and one plots which are being woven throughout Zulu land. The whole country teems with plots. Mnya mane, the late Prime. Minister, and one of the ablest, and perhaps tbe most influential man in Zululand, is plotting for the return of Cetywayo. Bishop Colenso, again, is as usual working his own wires, and creating agitations to forward his ends, whatever they may be at tbe moment. John Dunn, on the other band, is plotting to succeed Cetywayo, and so on ad infinitnm. Such is the state of affairs with which our unfortunate Besident has to contend. Invested with large imaginary powers, he has in reality nothing but his personal iufluence and his own wits to help him. He has no white man to assist him, but living alone in a broken down tent and some mud huts built by his son's hands (for the Government have never kept their promise to put him up a house), in the midst of thousands of rest less and scheming savages, amidst plots against the peace and against his authority, he has to do the best he can to carry out an impracticable settlement, and to maintain the character of English justice and the honour of the English name. Were Mr. Osborn to throw up his post or to be assassinated, the authorities would find it difficult to keep the whole settlement from collapsing like a card castle. Nobody who understood Zulu character and aspira tions could ever have executed such a settlement as Sir Garnet Wolseley's, unless he did it in obedience to some motive or instructions that it was not advisable"], [128, "CETYWAYO 44 to publish. It is true that Sir Garnet's experience of the Zulus was extremely small, and that he put aside the advice of those who did know them with that con tempt with which be is wont to treat colonists and their opinions. Sir Garnet Wolseley does not like colonial people, possibly because they are so rude as to openly say, that, in tbeir opinion, he did more mischief in Africa in a few months than it would take an ordinary official a lifetime to accomplish, However this may be, stop his ears as much as be might, Sir Garnet cannot have been entirely blind to the import of what be was doing, and tbe only explana tion of his action is that be entered on it more with the idea of flattering and gratifying English public opinion, than of doing bis best for the Zulus or tbe white colonists on tbeir borders. A great outcry had been raised at home, where, in common with most South African affairs, tbe matter was not thoroughly understood, against the supposed intended annexation of Zululand for the benefit of \" greedy colonists.\" It was argued that colonists were anxious for the annexa tion in order that they might get the land to speculate with, and doubtless this was, in individual instances, true. I fully agree with those who think that it would be unwise to throw open Zululand to the European settler, not on account of tbe Zulus, who would benefit by tbe change, but because tbe result would be a state of affairs similar to that in Natal, where there are a few white men surrounded by an ever-growing mass of Kafirs. But there is a vast difference between Annexa tion proper and the Protectorate it was our duty to establish over the natives. Such an arrangement would have presented few difficulties, and have brought with"], [129, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 45 it many advantages. White men could have been forbidden to settle in tbe country. A small hut-tax, such as the Zulus would have cheerfully paid, would have brought in forty or fifty thousand a year, an ample sum to defray the expenses of the Besident and sub-Besidents, the maintenance of an adequate native force to keep order, and even the execution of necessary public works. It is impossible to overrate the advan tages that must have resulted both to , the Zulus and their white neighbours from tbe adoption of this obvious plan, among them being lasting peace and security to life and property ; or to understand the folly and cruelty that dictated the present arrangement, or rather want of arrangement. Not for many years has England missed such an opportunity of doing good, not only at no cost, but with positive advantage to herself. Did wre owe nothing to this people whose kingdom we had broken up, and whom we bad been shooting down by thousands ? They may well ask, as they do continually, what they have done that we should treat them as we have and are doing ? It cannot be too clearly understood, that, when tbe Zulus laid down tbeir arms, they did so, hoping and be lieving that they would be taken over by the English Government, which, having been fairly beaten by it, they now looked on as tbeir bead or king, and be ruled like tbeir brethren in Natal. They expected to have to pay taxes and to have white magistrates placed over them, and they or the bulk of them looked forward to tbe change with pleasure. It must be remembered that when once they have found their master, there exists no more law-abiding people in tbe world than the Zulus, provided they are ruled firmly, and above all"], [130, "46 CETYWAYO justly. Believing that such a rule would fall to tbeir lot they surrendered when they did. How great, then, must their surprise have been when they found that, without tbeir wishes being consulted in the matter, their own hereditary king was to be sent away, and thirteen little kings set up in his place, with, strangest of all, a white man as chief little king, whilst\" tbe British Government contented itself with placing a Besident in the country to watch the troubles that must ensue. Such a settlement as this could only have one object and one result, neither of which is at all creditable to the English people. The Zulus were parcelled out among thirteen chiefs, in order that their strength might be kept down by internecine war and mutual distrust and jealousy : and, as though it were intended to render this result more certain, territories were chucked about in tbe careless way I have described, whilst central authority was abolished, and the vacant throne is dangled before all eyes labelled \" the prize of the strongest.\" Of course Sir Garnet's paper agree- ments with the chiefs were for the most part disre- garded from the first. For instance, every chief has his army, and uses it too. In Zululand bloodshed is now a thing of everyday occurrence, and the whole country is torn by fear, uncertainty, and consequent want.1 The settlement is bearing its legitimate fruit ; some thousands of Zulus have already been killed in direct consequence of it, and more will doubtless follow. And this is the outcome of all tbe blood and treasure spent over the Zulu war ! Well, we have settled 1 A severe famine is said to be imminent in Zululand."], [131, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 47 Zululand on the most approved principles, and thank Heaven, British influence has not been extended ! To show that I am not singular in my opinion as to the pre'sent state of Zululand, I may be allowed to quote a few short extracts, taken at random, from half-a-dozen numbers of the Natal Mercury. Talking of the Zulu settlement terms as dictated by Sir G. Wolseley, the leading article of the issue 21st November 1881 says: \u2014 \" It will at once be apparent that these terms have in several cases been flagrantly violated, especially as regards clauses of 2, 3, 4, and 6. This last will assuredly be broken again and yet again, so long as the British Besident occupies tbe position of an official mollusc. The chiefs themselves perceive and admit the evils that must arise out of the absence of any effective central authority. These evils are so obvious, they were so generally recognised at the outset as being inherent in tbe scheme, that we might almost suppose tbeir occurrence bad been deliberately anticipated as a desired outcome of the settlement. The morality of such a line of policy would be precisely on a par with that which is involved in tbe proposal to reinstate Cetywayo as a means of dealing with the Boers. The creation of thirteen kinglets in order that they might destroy each other, is as humane and high-minded an effort of statesmanship as would be the restoration of a banished king in order that he might eat up a people to whom tbe same power has just given back their independence. To the simple colonial mind such deep designs of Machiavellian statecraft are as hateful as they are inhuman and dishonest.\" A correspondent of the Mercury in Zululand writes under date of 13th October : \u2014"], [132, "CETYWAYO 48 \" I send a line at the last moment to say that things are going from bad to worse at railway speed. Up to tbe arrival of Sir Evelyn Wood, tbe chiefs did not fully realise that they were really independent at all. Now they do, and if I mistake not, like a beggar on horse back will ride to tbe devil sharp. Obam has begun by killing a large number of tbe Amagalusi people. My information is derived from native sources, and may be somewhat exaggerated. It is that the killed at Isandblwana were few compared with those killed by Uhamu a few days ago. Usibebu also and Undabuka are, I am told, on the point of coming to blows ; and if they do that it will be worse still, for Undabuka will find supporters throughout tbe length and breadth of Zululand. Undabuka, the full brother of the ex-king, is tbe protege\" of the Bishop of Natal. The Bishop, I find, has again sent one of bis agents (Amajuba by name) calling for another deputation. The deputation is now on its way to Natal, and that, I understand, against tbe express refusal of the Besident to allow it.\" In the issue of 14th November is published a letter from Mr. Nunn, a gentleman well known in Zululand, from which, as it is too long to quote in its entirety, I give a few extracts : \u2014 \" Oham's Camp, Oct. 1 5. \u2014 The Zulus cannot comprehend the Transvaal affair, and it has been industriously circulated amongst them that the English have been beaten and forced to give back tbe Transvaal. They do not understand gracious acts of restoration after we have been beaten. Four times this year has Umnyamana called bis army together and menaced Oham, who has several times had to have parties of bis followers sleeping around his kraal in the bills adjacent, so as to give him timely notice to fly."], [133, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 49 When Oham left his kraal for the purpose of attending the meeting at Inslasatye, tbe same day the whole of tbe Maquilisini tribe came on to the hills adjacent to Oham's kraal, the 'Injamin,' and threatened that dis trict. This has been tbe case on two or three former occasions, and simultaneously Umnyamana's tribe and Undabuka's followers always flew to arms, thus threat ening on all sides. . . . Trading is and has been for months entirely suspended in this district. The fields are unplanted, no ploughs or Kafir-picks at work \u2014 all are in a state of excitement, not knowing the moment a collision may take place. Hunger will stare many in the face next year, and all the men yelling to their chiefs to be let. loose and put an end to this state of uncertainty.\" Mr. Nunn encloses an account by an eye-witness of a battle which took place on the 2d October 18S1 between Oham's army and the Maquilisini tribe. The following is an extract: \u2014 \"On the 2d there was a heavy mist, and on moving forward the mounted party found them selves in the midst of tbe enemy (the Maquilisini), and on hearing a cry to stab the horses, they rode through them with no casualty (except one horse slightly wounded with a bullet). The army, moving in a half circle, now became generally engaged in a hand-to-hand fight, and our men were checked and annoyed by a number of the enemy armed with guns, who were in a stone-kraal, and kept up a constant fire. Amatonga, now at the head of tbe mounted party, charged and drove the enemy out of tbe kraal, from which they three several times charged the enemy on tbe flank, assisted by a small infantry party, and cut paths through their ranks. The fight, which had now lasted nearly an hour, D"], [134, "CETYWAYO 50 commenced to flag, and Oham's army making a sudden rush entirely routed tbe enemy, and the carnage lasted to the Bevan river, the boundary of tbe Transvaal. No women or children were killed, but out of an army of about 1500 of the enemy but few escaped\" (sic). . . . \"Tbe men, as they were being killed, repeatedly exclaimed, 'We are dying through Umnyamana and Umlabaku.' \" In the Natal Mercury of tbe 1 3th March occurs tbe following : \u2014 \"Zulu Country. \u2014 As to the state of the country it is something we cannot describe ; everything is upside down, and the chiefs appointed by tbe Government are mere nobodies, and have not any power over their own people. Even the Besident is in a false position, and seems perfectly powerless to act either way. We had one row, just arriving at a kraal in time to save it from being eaten up. Witchcraft and killing, one of the pre tences on which the English made war, are of every day occurrence, and fifty times worse than they were before tbe war. Oham and Tibysio (?) keep tbeir men continually in tbe field, consequently those districts are at present in a state of famine.\" Sir Garnet Wolseley executed tbe Zulu settlement on the 1st September 1879. The above extracts will suffice to show the state of tbe country after it has been working for little more than two years. They will also, I believe, suffice to convince any just and impartial mind that I do not exaggerate when I say that it is an abomination and a disgrace to England. The language may be strong, but when one hears of 1 500 unfortunates (nearly twice as many as we lost at Isandhlwana) being slaughtered in a single intertribal"], [135, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 51 broil, it is time to use strong language. It is not as though this were an unexpected or an unavoidable de velopment of events, every man who knew the Zulus predicted the misery that must result from such a settle ment, but those who directed their destinies turned a deaf ear to all warnings. They did not wish to hear. And now we are told that civil war is imminent between the Cetywayo or anti-settlement party, and what I must, for want of a better name, call the John Dunn party, or those who have acquired interest under the settlement, and who for various reasons wish to see Cetywayo's face no more. If this occurs, and it will occur unless tbe Government makes up its mind to do something before long, tbe slaughter, not only of men, but also of women and children, will be enormous ; fugitives will pour into Natal, followed perhaps by tbeir pursuers, and for aught we know tbe war may spread into our own dominions. We are a philan thropic people, very, when Bulgarians are concerned, or when the subject is one that piques a morbid curio sity, or is tbe rage of the moment, and the subject of addresses from great and eloquent speakers. But we can sit still, and let such massacres as these take place, when we have but to bold up our hand to stop them. When occasionally the veil is lifted a little, and the public hears of \"fresh fighting in Zululand,\" a ques tion is asked in the House; Mr. Courtney, as usual, has no information, but generally discredits the report, and it is put aside as \" probably not true.\" I am well aware that of those who read these words many will disbelieve them, or say that they are written for some object, or for party purposes. But it is not tbe case ; they are written in the interest of the truth, and in the"], [136, "CETYWAYO 52 somewhat faint hope that they may awaken a portion of the public, however small, to a knowledge of our responsibilities to tbe unfortunate Zulus. For try to get rid of it as we may, those responsibilities rest upon our shoulders. When we conquered the Zulu nation and sent away the Zulu king, we undertook, morally at any rate, to provide for the future good government of the country : otherwise, the Zulu war was unjust indeed. If we continue to fail, as we have hitherto, to carry out our responsibilities as a humane and Christian nation ought to do, our lapse from what is right will certainly recoil upon our own beads, and, in the stern lessons of future troubles and disasters, we shall learn that Providence with the nation, as with the individual, makes a neglected duty, its own avenger. We have sown tbe wind, let us be careful lest we reap the whirl wind. It is very clear that things cannot remain in tbeir present condition. If they do, it is probable that the Besident will sooner or later be assassinated ; not from any personal motives, but as a political necessity, and some second Chaka will rise up and found a new Zulu dynasty, sweeping away our artificial chiefs and divisions like cobwebs. This idea seems to have penetrated into Lord Kimberley's official mind, since in bis despatch of instructions to Sir H. Bulwer, written in February last, he says : \" Probably if the chiefs are left to themselves after a period more or less prolonged of war and anarchy, some man will raise himself to the position of supreme chief.\" The prospect of war and anarchy in Zululand does not, however, trouble Lord Kimberley at all ; in fact, the whole despatch is typical to a degree of the Liberal colonial policy. Lord Kimberley admits that"], [137, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 53 what little quiet the country has enjoyed under the settlement \" was due to a mistaken belief on the part of the Zulus that the British Government was ruling them, or would rule them through the Besident.\" He evidently clearly sees all the evils and bloodshed that are resulting and that must result from the present state of affairs ; indeed be recapitulates them, and then ends up by even refusing to allow such slight measures of relief as the appointment of sub-Besidents to be carried out, although begged for by the chiefs, on the ground that it might extend British influence. Of the interests of the Zulus themselves be is quite careless. The whole despatch can be summed up thus : \" If you can find any method to improve the state of affairs which will not subject us to the smallest cost, risk, or responsibility, you can employ it ; if not, let them fight it out.\" Perhaps Lord Kimberley may live (officially) long enough to find out that meanness and selfishness do not always pay, and that it is not always desirable thus to sacrifice the respect and crush the legitimate aspirations of a generous people. Unless something is done before long, it is possible that John Dunn may succeed after a bloody war in securing the throne ; but this would not prove a per manent arrangement, since he is now getting on in life and has no son to carry on the dynasty. Another possibility, and one that is not generally known, at any rate in this country, though it is perhaps tbe most pro bable of all, is this. Cetywayo has left a son in Zulu land, who is being carefully educated under the care of Mnyamane, the late king's Prime Minister. The boy is now about 16 years of age, and is reported to possess very good abilities, and is the trump card that Mnya-"], [138, "CETYWAYO 54 mane will play as soon as the time is ripe. This young man is tbe hereditary heir to the Zulu crown, and it is more than probable that if he is proclaimed king the vast majority of the nation will rally round him and establish him firmly on his throne. There is little use in keeping Cetywayo confined whilst bis son is at large. Tbe lad should have been brought to England and educated, so that he might at some future time have assisted in the civilisation of his country : as it is, he is growing up in a bad school. And now I come to tbe root of the whole matter \u2014 tbe question whether or no, under all these circumstances, it is right or desirable to re-establish Cetywayo on tbe throne of Zululand. In considering this question, I think that Cetywayo's individuality ought to be put on one side, however much we may sympathise with bis position, as I confess I do to some extent myself. After all, Cetywayo is only one man, whereas the happiness, security, and perhaps the lives of many thousands are involved in the issue of the question. In coming to any conclusion in the matter it is necessary to keep in view the intentions of the Government as regards our future connection with Zululand. If the Government intends to do its duty and rule Zululand as it ought to be ruled, by the appointment of proper magistrates, the establish ment of an adequate force, and the imposition of the necessary taxes, then it wrould be the height of folly to permit Cetywayo to return, since his presence would defeat the scheme. It must be remembered that there is as yet nothing whatsoever to prevent this plan being carried out. It would be welcomed with joy by the large majority of both Zulus and colonists. It would also solve the problem of the increase of the native popula-"], [139, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 55 tion of Natal, which is assuming most alarming propor tions, since Zululand, being very much under-populated, it would be easy, were that country once quietly settled, to draft the majority of the Natal Zulus back into it. This is undoubtedly tbe best course, and indeed the only right course ; but it does not at all follow that it will be taken, since governments are unfortunately more concerned at the prospect of losing votes than with the genuine interests of their dependencies. The proper settlement of Zululand would not be popular amongst a large class in this country, and therefore it is not likely to be carried out, however right and neces sary it may be. If nothing is going to be done, then it becomes a question whether or no Cetywayo should be sent back. The large majority of the Natalians consider that his restoration would be an act of suicidal folly, and their opinion is certainly entitled to great weight, since they are after all the people principally concerned. The issue of tbe experiment would be a matter of compara tive indifference to people living 7000 miles away, but is naturally regarded with some anxiety by those who have their homes on tbe borders of Zululand. It is very well to sympathise with savage royalty in distress, but it must be borne in mind that there are others to be considered besides the captive king. Many of the Zulus, for instance, are by no means anxious to see him again, since they look forward with just apprehension to the line of action be may take with those who have not shown sufficient anxiety for his return, or have in other ways incurred his resentment. One thing is clear, to send the king back to Zululand is to restore"], [140, "56 CETYWAYO the status in quo as it was before the war. There can be no half measures about it, no more worthless paper stipulations; a Zulu king must either be allowed to rule in bis own fashion or not at all. The war would go for nothing, and would doubtless have to be fought over again with one of Cetywayo's successors. Also it must be remembered that it is one thing to talk of restoring Cetywayo, and another to carry bis restoration into effect. It would not simply be a ques tion of turning him down on tbe borders of Zululand, and letting him find his own way back to his throne, for such a proceeding would be the signal for the out break of civil war. It is not to be supposed that John Dunn, and those whose interests are identical with Dunn's, would allow the ex- king to reseat himself on tbe throne without a struggle ; indeed the former has openly declared his intention of resisting the attempt by force of arms if necessary. He is by no means anxious to give up the ;\u00a3 15,000 a year that bis hut-tax brings in, and all the contingent profits and advantages of his chieftainship. If we wish to restore Cetywayo we must first depose Dunn ; in fact, we must be ready to support bis restoration by force of arms. As regards Cetywayo himself, I cannot share tbe opinion of those who think that he would be personally dangerous. He has learnt his lesson, and would not be anxious to try conclusions with the English again ; in deed, I believe he would prove a staunch ally. But supposing him re-established on tbe throne, bow long would it be before a revolution, or the hand of the assassin, to say nothing of tbe ordinary chances of nature, put an end to him, and bow do we know that his successor in power would share bis views ?"], [141, "AND THE ZULU SETTLEMENT. 57 Cetywayo's rule, bad as it was, was perhaps prefer able to the reign of terror that we have established under the name of a settlement. But that we can still remedy if we choose to do so, whereas, if we once restore Cetywayo, all power over the Zulus passes out of our bands. We have many interests to consider in South Africa, all of which will be more or less affected by our action in this matter. On tbe whole, I am of opinion that the Government that replaces Cetywayo on the throne of bis fathers will undertake a very grave responsi bility, and must be prepared to deal with many result ing complications, not the least of which will be the utter exasperation of tbe white inhabitants of Natal."], [142, "58 NATAL AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. Natal has an area of about 18,000 square miles, and its present population is, roughly, 25,000 whites and 400,000 natives of the Zulu race. When, in 1843, it first became a British colony, the number of natives living within its borders was very small, and they were for the most part wanderers, fragmentary rem nants of the tribes that Chaka had destroyed. I shall probably be under, rather than over the mark, if I say, that the Zulu population of the colony has multi plied itself by ten during the last thirty years. Two causes have combined to bring about this extraordinary increase \u2014 firstly, wholesale immigration from the sur rounding territories ; and, secondly, tbe practice of polygamy. This immigration has been due to a great want of foresight, or want of knowledge, on the part of the Home authorities, who have allowed it to go on with out check or hindrance till it has, in conjunction with its twin evil polygamy, produced the state of affairs it is my object to describe. Ever since its first establishment as a colony Natal has been turned into a city of refuge for tbe native inhabitants of Zululand, the Transvaal, Swaziland, and elsewhere. If news"], [143, "NATAL AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 59 came to a Zulu chief that his king purposed to eat him up, he at once fled across tbe Tugela with his wives and followers and settled in Natal. If the Boers or Swazis destroyed a tribe, the remnant found its way to Natal. That country, indeed, is to tbe South African native a modern Isles of the Blest. Once across the border line, and, whatever his crime, he is in a position to defy his worst enemy, and can rest secure in the pro tection of tbe Home and Local Governments, and of the enactments specially passed to protect him and bis privileges. The Government allots him land, or if it does not he squats on private land, bringing with him his own peculiar and barbarous customs. In all the world I do not know a race more favoured by circumstances than the Natal Zulus. They live on the produce of the fields that their wives cultivate, or rather scratch, doing little or no work, and having no occasion to do any. They are very rich, and their taxes are a mere trifle \u2014 fifteen shillings per annum for each hut. They bear no share of the curse that comes to all other men as a birthright \u2014 they need not labour. Protected by a powerful Government, they do not fear attack from without, or internal disorder. What all men desire, riches and women, are theirs in abundance, and even their children, the objects of so much expense and sore perplexity to civilised parents, are to them a source of wealth. Their needs are few \u2014 a straw hut, corn for food, and tbe bright sun. They are not even troubled with tbe thought of a future life, but, like the animals, live through their healthy, happy days, and at last, in extreme old age, meet a death which for them has no terrors, because it practically"], [144, "60 NATAL means extinction. When compared to that of civilised races, or even of tbeir own brethren in the interior, their lot is indeed a happy one. But tbe stream of immigration, continuous though it has been, would not by itself have sufficed to bring up the native population to its present enormous total, without tbe assistance of the polygamous customs of tbe immigrants. I believe that inquirers have ascertained, that, as a general rule, the practice of polygamy has not tbe effect of bringing about an abnormal growth of popula tion. However this may be elsewhere, in Natal, owing in great measure to tbe healthy customs of tbe Zulu race,1 tbe rate of increase is unprecedented. Many writers and other authorities consider polygamy as an institution to be at once wicked and disgusting. As to its morality, it is a point upon which it is difficult to express any opinion, nor, indeed, does the question enter into tbe scope of what I have to say ; but it must be remembered that in the case of tbe Zulu bis whole law and existence is mixed up with the institu tion, and that it is necessary to him to repair tbe gaps made in bis ranks by war. Violent anti-polygamists in this> country always make a strong point of tbe cruelty it is supposed to involve to tbe women, and talk about tbe \" violation of their holiest feelings.\" As a matter of fact, sad as it may appear, the Zulu women are much attached to the custom, nor would they, as a general rule, consent to marry a man who 1 As soon as a Zulu woman is discovered to be pregnant her husband ceases to cohabit with her, nor does he live with her again until the child is weaned, eighteen months, and sometimes two years, after its birth."], [145, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 61 only purposed taking one wife. There are various reasons for this : for instance, the first wife is a person of importance, and takes precedence of all the others, a fact as much appreciated by the Zulu woman as by the London lady. Again, the more wives there are, tbe more wealth it brings into the family, since in the ordinary course of nature more wives mean more female children, who, when they come to a marriage able age, mean in tbeir turn at least ten cows each (the Government price for a wife). The amount thus obtained is placed to the credit of the estate of the mother of the girl married, and for this reason all Zulu women are extremely anxious to have children, especially female children. Finally, the liking of Zulu women for the custom is bred in them. It has been going on for countless generations, and it is probable that it will go on for so long as the race endures. Nations do not change such habits unless the change is forced on them, with the alternative of extermination. Polygamy will never be eradicated by moral persua sion, because, even if a native could be brought to think it wrong, which is in itself impossible, its abolition would affect his interests irredeemably. A Zulus wives are also bis servants ; they plough his land and husband his grain, in addition to bearing his children. Had he but one Wife most of her time would be taken up with the latter occupation, and then tbe mealie planting and gathering would necessarily fall to the lot of the husband, a state of affairs he would never consent to. Again, if monogamy were established, girls would lose their value, and a great source of wealth would be destroyed. It must, however, be understood that Zulu girls are not exactly sold ; the cows received by tbe"], [146, "NATAL 62 parents are by a legal fiction supposed to be a gift presented, not a price paid. Should the wife subse quently run away, they are, I believe, returnable. On these subjects, as is not to be wondered at when so many interests are concerned, the Zulu law is a little intricate. The cleverest counsel in tbe Temple could not give an opinion on such a case as tbe following : \u2014 A. has four wives, and children by Nos. i and 3. On bis death bis brother, B., a rich man, takes over his wives and property, and has children by each of the four women. He has also children by other wives. On his death, in extreme old age, how should the property be divided amongst the descendants of tbe various marriages ? It is clear that if such a case as this is to be dealt with at all it must be under native law, and this is one of tbe great dangers of polygamy. Once rooted in a state it necessitates a double system of laws, since civilised law is quite unable to cope with the cases daily arising from its practice. It is sometimes argued that the law employed is a matter of indifference, provided that substantial justice is done, according to the ideas of people concerned, and this is doubtless very true if it is accepted as a fact that the Zulu popu lation of Natal is always to remain in its present condition of barbarism. To continue to administer their law is to give it tbe sanction of the white man's authority, and every day that it is so administered makes it more impossible to do away with it. I say \" more impossible \" advisedly, because I believe its abrogation is already impossible. There is no satis factory way out of tbe difficulty, because it has its"], [147, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 63 roots in, and draws its existence from, the principle of polygamy, which I believe will last while the people last. Some rely on the Missionary to effect this stupen dous change, and turn a polygamous people into monogamists. But it is a well-known fact that the missionaries produce no more permanent effect on the Zulu mind than a child does on the granite rock which he chips at with a chisel. How many real Christians are there in Zululand and Natal, and of that select and saintly band how many practise monogamy ? But very few, and among those few there is a large proportion of bad characters, men who have adopted Christianity as a last resource. I mean no disrespect to the missionaries, many of whom are good men, doing tbeir best under the most unpromis ing conditions, though some are simply traders and political agitators. But the fact remains the same. Christianity makes no appreciable progress amongst the Zulu natives, whilst, on the other hand, no one having any experience in the country will, if he can avoid it, have a so-called Christian Kafir in his house, because the term is but too frequently synonymous with that of drunkard and thief. I do not wish it to be understood that it is the fact of his Christianity that so degrades the Zulu, because I do not think it has anything to do with it. It is only that the novice, standing on the threshold of civilisation, as a rule finds the vices of tbe white man more congenial than his virtues. The Zulus are as difficult to convince of the truths of Christianity as were tbe Jews, whom they so much resemble in tbeir customs. They have a natural"], [148, "64 NATAL disinclination to believe that which they cannot see, and, being constitutionally very clever and casuistical, are prepared to argue each individual point with an ability very trying to missionaries. It was one of these Zulus, known as the Intelligent Zulu, but in reality no more intelligent than his fellows, whose shrewd remarks first caused doubts to arise in the mind of Bishop Col&nso, and through him in those of thousands of others. Another difficulty in the way of tbe missionary is, that he is obliged to insist on the putting away of surplus wives, and thus to place himself out of court at the outset. It is quite conceivable that in the opinion of wild and savage men it is preferable to let the new teaching alone, rather than to adopt it at the cost of such a radical change in their domestic arrange ments. As a case in point I may quote that of Hlubi, the Basuto appointed chief of one of the divisions of Zululand by Sir G. Wolseley. Hlubi is at heart a Christian, and a good man, and anxious to be baptized. The missionaries, however, refuse to baptize him because be has two wives. Hlubi therefore remains a heathen, saying, not unnaturally, that he feels it would be impossible for him to put away a woman with whom he has lived for so many years. Whilst polygamy endures Christianity will advance with but small strides. It seems to me that we are beginning at the wrong end. We must civilise first and Christianise afterwards. As well try to sow corn among rocks and look to gather a full crop, as expect the words of Grace and Divine love to bear fruit in the hearts of a people whose forefathers have for countless generations been men of blood, whose prized"], [149, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 65 traditions are one long story of slaughter, and who, if they are now at peace, are, as it were, only gathering strength for a surer spring. First, the soil must be prepared before the seed is sown. To do this there is but one way. Abolish native customs and laws, especially polygamy, and bring our Zulu subjects within the pale of our own law. Deprive them of their troops of servants in the shape of wives, and thus force them to betake themselves to honest labour like tbe rest of mankind. There is only one objection in the way of the realisation of this scheme, which would, doubtless, bring about, in the course of a generation, a much better state of things, and gather many thousand con verts into the fold of the Church ; and that is, the opportunity has, so far as Natal is concerned, been missed \u2014 the time has gone by when it could have been carried out. To young countries, as to young men, there come sometimes opportunities of control ling their future destinies, which, if not seized at the moment, pass away for ever, or only to return after long and troubled years. Natal has had her chance, and it has gone away from her, though through no fault of her own. If, when the colony was first settled, tbe few natives who then lived there bad been forced to conform to the usages of civilised life or to quit its borders ; if refugees had been refused admis sion save on the same terms, it would not occupy tbe very serious position it does at the present moment. To understand the situation into which Natal has drifted with reference to its native inhabitants, it is necessary to premise that that country has hitherto E"], [150, "NATAL 66 bad practically no control over its own affairs, more especially as regards native legislation. In its early days it was a happy, quiet place, a favoured clime, where the traveller or settler could find good shooting, cheap labour, and cheap living. No enemy threatened its rest, and the natives were respectful and peaceful in their behaviour. But it was in those days that the native difficulty, that Upas tree that now overshadows and poisons tbe whole land, took root ; for slowly from all parts, all through that quiet time, by ones, by tens, by hundreds, refugees were flowing in, and asking and receiving land to settle on from the Government. It is not, however, to be supposed that tbe local officials did not perceive the gathering danger, since it has again and again been pointed out to different Secretaries of State, and again and again been ignored by them, or put off for the consideration of their successors. Hand-to-mouth legislation has always been tbe characteristic of our rule in South Africa. On one occasion Sir Theophilus, then Mr. Shepstone, went so far as to offer to personally draw off a large portion of tbe native population, and settle them on some vacant territory bordering on the Cape Colony, but the suggestion was not acceded to, for fear lest the execution of the scheme should excite disturbances amongst the natives of the Cape. Thus year after year has passed away \u2014 plan after plan has been put aside, \u2014 and nothing has been done. In the colony a great deal of abuse is poured out on the bead of Sir T. Shepstone, to whom the present native situation is unjustly attributed by a certain party of politicians. Sir T. Shepstone was for very"], [151, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 67 many years Secretary for Native Affairs in Natal, but until be came to England, shortly before tbe termination of his official career, he was personally unknown to the Colonial Office, and bad no influence there. It was totally out of his power to control the policy of tbe Home Government with reference to tbe Natal natives ; he could only take things as he found them, and make tbe best of such materials as came to his hand. As he could not keep the natives out of the colony or prevent polygamy, he did what he could towards making them loyal and contented subjects. How well he succeeded, and with what consummate tact and knowledge he must have exer cised his authority, is shown by the fact that in all these years there has been but one native disturbance, namely, that of Langalibalele, and by the further fact that the loyalty of the Natal Zulus stood the strain of the Zulu war. Also, there never has been, and pro bably never will be, another white man so universally beloved and reverenced by the natives throughout the length and breadth of South Africa. But Sir T. Shepstone's influence for good will pass away, as all purely personal influence must, and mean while, what is the situation ? On tbe one hand, there is a very slowly increasing, scattered, and mixed popu lation of about 25,000 whites, capable, at the outside, of putting a force of 4000 men in the field. On the other, there is a warlike native population, united by the ties of race and common interests, numbering at the present moment between 400,000 and 500,000, and increasing by leaps and bounds, capable of putting quite 80,000 warriors into tbe field, and possessing, besides, numerous strongholds called locations. At"], [152, "68 NATAL present these two rival populations live side by side in peace and amity, though at heart neither loves tbe other. Tbe two races are so totally distinct that it is quite impossible for them to have much community of feeling ; they can never mingle ; tbeir ideas are different, their objects are different, and in Natal their very law is different. Kafirs respect and like indi- vidual Englishmen, but I doubt whether they are par- ticularly fond of us as a race, though they much prefer us to any other white men, and are devoted to our rule, so long as it is necessary to them. The average white man, on tbe other band, detests the Kafir, and looks on him as a lazy good-for-nothing, who ought to work for him and will not work for him, whilst he is quite incapable of appreciating his many good points. It is an odd trait about Zulus that only gentlemen, in tbe true sense of the word, can win tbeir regard, or get anything out of them. It is obvious that, sooner or later, these two races must come into contact, the question being bow lono tbe present calm will last. To this question I will venture to suggest an answer, \u2014 I believe tbe right one. It will last until the native gets so cramped for room that he has no place left to settle on, except the white man's lands. Tbe white man will then try to turn him off, whereupon the native will fall back on tbe primitive resource of killinc him and possessing himself of the land by force. This plan, simultaneously carried out on a large scale, would place the colony at the mercy of its native inhabitants. Nor is the time so very far distant when English men and Zulus will stand face to face over this land question. In the early days of the colony, locations"], [153, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 69 were established in the mountainous districts, because they were comparatively worthless, and the natives were settled in them by tribes. Of what goes on in these locations very little is known, except that they are crowded, and that the inhabitants are as entirely wedded to tbeir savage customs as their forefathers were before them. As there is no more room in the locations, many thousands of Kafirs have settled upon private lands, sometimes with and sometimes without the leave of the owners. But, for many reasons, this is a state of affairs that cannot go on for ever. In a few years the private lands will be filled up, as well as the locations, and what then ? Zulus are a people who require a very large quantity of land, since they possess great numbers of cattle which must have grazing room. Also their cultivation being of the most primitive order, and consisting as it does of picking out the very richest patches of land, and cropping them till they are exhausted, all ordinary land being rejected as too much trouble to work, the possession, or the right of usor, of several hundred acres is necessary to the support of a single family. Nor, if we may judge from precedent, and its well-marked characteristics, is it to be supposed that this race will at the pinch suit itself to circumstances, take up less land, and work harder. Zulus would rather fight to the last than discard a cherished and an ancient custom. Savages they are, and savages they will remain, and in the struggle between them and civilisation it is possible that they may be conquered, but I do not believe that they will be converted. The Zulu Kafir is incompatible with civilisation."], [154, "NATAL 70 It will be seen, from what I have said, that Natal might more properly be called a Black settlement than an English colony. Looking at it from the former point of view, it is a very interesting experi ment. For the first time probably since their race came into existence, Zulu natives have got a chance given them of increasing and multiplying without being periodically decimated by the accidents of war, whilst at the same time enjoying the protection of a strong and a just government. It remains to be seen what use they will make of their opportunity. That they will avail themselves of it for the purposes of civilising themselves I do not believe; but it seems to me possible that they will learn from tbe white man the advantages of combination, and aim at de veloping themselves into a powerful and united black nation. It is in the face of this state of things that Lord Kimberley now proposes to grant responsible govern ment to the white inhabitants of Natal, should they be willing to accept it, providing that it is to carry with it the responsibility of ruling tbe natives, and further, of defending the colony from the attacks of its neigh bours, whether white or coloured. Natal has hitherto been ruled under a hybrid con stitution, which, whilst allowing the Legislative As sembly of the colony to pass laws, &c, reserves all real authority to the Crown. There has, however, been for some years past a growing agitation amongst a pro portion of its inhabitants, instituted with the object of inducing the Home Government to concede practical independence to the colony, Her Majesty having on several occasions been petitioned on the subject by tbe"], [155, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 71 Legislative Council. On the 13th February 1880, Sir G. Wolseley, who was at tbe time Governor of Natal, wrote what I can only call an intemperate despatch to the Secretary of State, commenting on the prayer for responsible government, which he strongly condemned. He also took the opportunity to make a series of somewhat sharp attacks on tbe colonists in general, whose object in asking for independence was, be implied, to bring the black man in relations of \" appropriate servitude to his white superior.\" It would appear, however, from words used by him towards the end of his despatch, that the real reason of his violence was, that he seared that one of the first acts of the Natal Parliament would be to put an end to his settlement in Zululand, which was and is the laughing stock of tbe colony. He was probably right in this supposition. The various charges be brings against tbe colonists are admirably and conclusively refuted in a minute adopted by the Legislative Council of Natal, dated 20th December 1880. In a despatch, dated 15th March 1881, Lord Kim berley refuses to accede to the request for the grant of Besponsible Government. On the 28 th of December, the Legislative Council again petitioned the Crown on the subject, and forwarded to Lord Kimberley a report of a Select Committee appointed to consider the matter, in which the following words occur : \u2014 \" Your committee hold that while the colony may well be held responsible for its defence from such aggression as may be caused by the acts or policy of a responsible government, it cannot justly be saddled with tbe obligation to meet acts of aggression from"], [156, "NATAL 72 bordering territories that have arisen out of tbe cir cumstances or measures over which such government have had no control ; although, as a matter of fact, the brunt of defence (must be borne ?) in the first instance by the colonists. The Council, therefore, neither exer cises, nor desires to exercise, any control over terri tories adjacent to or bordering on the colony ; for the preservation of its own internal peace and order the colony is prepared to provide. The duty of protecting tbe colony from external foes, whether by sea or land, devolves on tbe Empire as a whole, otherwise to be a section of that Empire constitutes no real privilege.\" To this report, somewhat to tbe surprise of the Natalians, Lord Kimberley returned, in a despatch addressed to Sir H. Bulwer, on tbe occasion of his depar ture to take up the Governorship of Natal, and dated 2d February 1882, a most favourable reply. In fact, he is so obliging as to far exceed tbe wishes of tbe Natalians as expressed in the passage just quoted, and to tell them that Her Majesty's Government is not only ready to give them responsible government, but that it will ex pect them to defend their own frontiers, independently of any assistance from the Imperial Government. He further informs them that tbe Imperial troops will be withdrawn, and that the only responsibility Her Majesty's Government will retain with reference to the colony will be that of its defence against aggression by foreign powers. This sudden change of face on tbe part of the Imperial Government, which had up till now flatly refused to grant any measure of self-government to Natal, may at first seem rather odd, but on examina tion it will be found to be quite in accordance with"], [157, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 73 the recently developed South African policy of Mr. Gladstone's Government. There is little doubt that it is an article of faith among the Liberal party that the less the mother-country has to do with her colonies, and more especially with her South African colonies, the better. A grand step was made in the direction of the abandonment of our South African Empire when we surrendered the Transvaal to the Boers, and it is clear that if our troops can be withdrawn from Natal and all responsibility for the safety of that colony put an end to, the triumph of self-effacement will be still more complete. But there is another and more im mediate reason for Lord Kimberley's generous offer. He knows, no one better, that the policy pursued in South Africa, both as regards the Transvaal and Zululand, must produce its legitimate fruit \u2014 bloodshed \u2014 before very long. He, or rather his Government, is consequently anxious to cut the connection before anything of tbe sort occurs, when they will be able to attribute the trouble, whatever it is, to the ill-advised action of the Colonial Legislature. What is still more strange, however, is that the colonists, having regard to the position they occupy with reference to the Kafirs that surround them, to whom they bear the same relative proportion that the oases do to the desert, or the islands of an archipelago to the ocean that washes tbeir shores, should wish for such a dangerous boon as that of self-government, if indeed they really do wish it. When I lived in Natal, I often heard the subject discussed, and watched the Legislative Council pass its periodical resolutions about it, but I confess I always looked on the matter as being more or less of a farce. There exists, bow-"], [158, "NATAL 74 ever, in Natal a knot of politicians wdio are doubtless desirous of tbe change, partly because they think that it would be really beneficial, and partly because they are possessed by a laudable ambition to fill the high positions of Prime Minister, Treasurer, &c, in the future Parliament. But these gentlemen for the most part live in the towns, where they are comparatively safe should a native rising occur. I have not noticed the same enthusiasm for responsible government among those Natalians who live up country in the neighbour hood of tbe locations. Still there does exist a considerable party who are in favour of the change \u2014 a party that has recently sprung into existence. Many things have occurred within the last few years to irritate and even exasperate people in Natal with tbe Imperial Government, and generally with the treatment that they have received at our hands. For instance, colonists are proverbially sensitive, and it is therefore rather hard that every newspaper correspondent or itinerant bookmaker who comes to their shores should at once proceed to print endless letters and books abusing them without mercy. The fact of the matter is that these gentlemen come, and put up at the hotels and pot-shops, where they meet all the loafers and bad characters in the country, whom they take to be specimens of the best class of colonists, whom they describe accordingly as the \" riddlings of society.\" Into tbe quiet, respectable, and happy homes that really give tbe tone to tbe colony they do not enter. It is also a favourite accusation to brins against the people of Natal that they make the South African wars in order to make money out of them. For"], [159, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 75 instance, in a leading article of one of the principal English journals, it was stated not long ago, that the murmurs of the colonists at being forced to eat the bread of humiliation in the Transvaal matter arose from no patriotic feeling, but from sorrow al the early termination of a war out of which they hoped to suck no small advantage. This statement is quite untrue. No doubt a great deal of money has been made out of tbe wars by a few colonial speculators, some of it, maybe, dishonestly ; but this is not an unusual occurrence in a foreign war. Was no money made dishonestly by English speculators and contractors in the Crimean War ? Cannot Manchester boast manufac turers ready to supply our enemies, \u2014 for cash payments, \u2014 with guns to shoot us with, or any other material of war ? It is not to be supposed that because a few specu lators made fortunes out of the Commissariat that the whole colony participated in the spoils of the various wars. On the contrary, the majority of its inhabi tants have suffered very largely. Not only have they run considerable personal risk, but since, and owing to, the Zulu and Boer wars the cost of living has almost, if not quite doubled, which, needless to say, has not been the case with their incomes. It is there fore peculiarly cruel that Natal should be gibbeted as the abode of scoundrels of . the worst sort, men pre pared to bring about bloodshed in order to profit by it. Sir Garnet Wolseley, however, found in this report of colonial dishonesty a convenient point of vantage from which to attack the colonists generally, and in bis despatch about responsible government we may be sure be did not spare them. The Legislative Council"], [160, "76 NATAL thus comments on bis remarks : \" To colonists a war means the spreading amongst them of distress, alarm, and confusion, peril to life and property in outlying districts, the arrest of progress, and general disorgani sation. . .

The Council regard with pain and indigna tion the uncalled-for and cruel stigma thus cast upon the colonists by Sir Garnet Wolseley.\" At first sight these accusations may not appear to have much to do with tbe question of whether or no the colonists should accept responsible government, but in reality they have, inasmuch as they create a feeling of soreness that inclines the Natalians to get rid of Imperial interference and the attendant criticism at any price. More substantial grievances against the English Government are tbe present condition of the native problem, which tbe colonists justly attribute to Im perial mismanagement and that triumph of genius, Sir Garnet Wolseley's settlement in Zululand. They see these evils, which they know were preventable, grow ing more formidable day by da}', and they imagine, or some of them do, that if they bad free institutions it would still be in their power to stop that growth. The whole question has now been referred to tbe colony, which is to elect a fresh Legislative Assembly on the issue of responsible government. The struggle between \" the party of progress,\" i.e., tbe responsible government section, and the reactionists, or those who are prepared to dispense with \" freedom,\" provided they can be sure of safety, is being carried on keenly, and at present it is doubtful which side will have a majority. I do not, however, believe that the majority of any Council returned will consent to accept Lord"], [161, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 77 Kimberley's proposal as it stands ; to walk into a parlour in which the spider is so very obvious, and to deliberately undertake tbe guardianship of all the Im perial interests in South- Eastern Africa. If they do, they will, in my opinion, deserve all they will get.1 The Natalians are fortunate at the present crisis in having, by dint of vigorous agitation against the appointment of Mr. Sendall, a gentleman selected by Lord Kimberley to govern them, obtained tbe re appointment of tbeir former Governor, Sir Henry Bulwer. Sir Henry, during his first tenure of office, lost credit with the South African colonists on account of his lukewarmness with reference to the Zulu war, but tbe course of events has gone far towards justify ing his views. He is one of the most hard-working and careful Governors that Natal has ever had, and, perhaps, the most judicious. Of a temperate and a cautious mind, be may be more safely trusted to pilot a country so surrounded with difficulties and dangers as Natal is than most men, and it is to be hoped that the application to the questions of tbe day of tbe strong common sense that he possesses in such an eminent degree may have a cooling effect on the hot heads and excited imaginations of the \" party of progress.\" In considering the pros and cons of the responsible government question, it must be steadily kept in sight that Natal is not likely to be a country with a 1 Since this chapter was written the Natal constituencies have, as I thought probable, declared against the acceptance of Lord Kimberley's offer in its present form, by returning a majority of anti-responsible government men.

To begin with, she has her native inhabitants to deal with. To-day they number, say 450,000; fifteen or twenty years hence they will number a million, or perhaps more. These men are no longer tbe docile overgrown children they were twenty years ago. The lessons of our performances in tbe Zulu and Boer wars, more especially the latter, have not been lost upon them, and they are beginning to think that the white man, instead of being tbe unconquer able demigod they thought him, is somewhat of a humbug. Pharaoh, we know, grew afraid of the Israelites ; Natal, with a much weaker ' power at com mand than that of Pharaoh, has got to cope with a still more dangerou selement, and one that cannot be induced to depart into tbe wilderness. And after all what does the power of Natal amount to ? Let us be liberal, and say six thousand men \u2014 it is tbe outside. In the event of a native rising, or any other serious war, I believe that of this number at least two thousand would make themselves scarce. There exists in all colonies a floating element of in dividuals who have drifted there for tbe purpose of making money, but who have no real affection for the (temporary) country of their adoption. Their capital is, as a rule, small and easily realised, and tbe very last thing that they would think of doing would be to engage in a deadly life or death struggle on behalf of a land that they only look on as a milch cow, out of which their object is to draw as much as possible. On the contrary, they would promptly seek another cow, leaving the old one to the tender mercies of the butcher. Their defection would leave some 4000 men to cope"], [163, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 79 with the difficulty, whatever it was, of which number at least iooo would be ineffective from age and various other causes, whilst of the remainder quite iooo would be obliged to remain where they were to protect women and children in outlying districts. This would leave a total effective force of 2000 men, or, deduct ing 500 for garrison purposes, of 1500 ready to take the field. But it would take some time to collect, arm, and equip even this number, and in the mean while, in the case of a sudden and preconcerted native rising, half the inhabitants of the colony would be murdered in detail. But Natalians have got other dangers to fear besides those arising from the presence of this vast mass of barbarism in their midst. After a period of anarchy a new king may possess himself of the throne of Zulu land, and it is even possible that he might, under circumstances that will arise hereafter, lead his armies into Natal, and create a difficulty with which the 1 500 available white men would find it difficult to cope. Or the Boers of the Orange Free State and Transvaal may get tired of paying customs dues at Durban, and march 5000 men down to take possession of the port! Perhaps Natal might provide herself with an effective force by enrolling an army of 10,000 or 20,000 Kafirs, but it seems to me that the proceeding would be both uncertain and expensive, and, should tbe army take it into its head to mutiny, very dangerous to boot. It is a noticeable fact that those who so ardently advocate tbe acceptance of Lord Kimberley's offer, in all tbeir speeches, addresses, and articles, almost entirely shirk this question of defence, which is, after"], [164, "NATAL 80 all, the root of the matter. I have formed my esti mate of the number of men forthcoming in time of danger on the supposition that a burgher law was in force in Natal, that is, that every man remaining in the country should be obliged to take a part in its defence. But they do not even hint at a burgher law \u2014 in fact, they repudiate tbe idea, because they know that it would not be tolerated. Tbe universal service system is not the Natalian's idea of happiness. They simply avoid the question, calling it the \" defence bug bear,\" and assume that it will all be arranged in some unforeseen way. Tbe only suggestion that I have yet seen as re cards tbe arrangements for the future defence of the colony, should it become independent, is a somewhat ominous one, namely \u2014 that Natal should enter into a close alliance, offensive and defensive, with the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. But, as the advocates of \" freedom \" would soon find, tbe Orange Free State (for even if willing to help them, the Transvaal will for some years have enough to do with its own affairs) will not come forward for nothing. There would first have to be a few business formalities with reference to tbe customs dues collected in Durban on goods passing through to the interior, which yield the bulk of the Natal revenue, and possibly some concessions to Boer public opinion as regards the English mode of dealing with the Natal natives. I incline to the opinion that in relying on tbe assistance of the Boers in time of trouble the inhabitants of Natal would be leaning on a broken reed. They are more likely to find them in arms against them than fighting on their side."], [165, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 81 The party of progress also talks much about the prospects of confederation with the Cape, if once they get responsible government. Most people, however, will think that the fact of their being independent, and therefore responsible for their own defence, will hardly prove an inducement to the Cape to offer to share those responsibilities. The only confederation possible to Natal as a self-governing community will be a Boer confederation, to which it may be admitted \u2014 on certain terms. Another cry is that the moment responsible government is established immigrants will flow into the country, and thus restore the balance of races. I take the liberty to doubt the truth of this supposition. The intending emigrant from Europe does not, it is true, understand the ins and outs of the Natal native question, but he does know that it is a place where there are wars and rumours of wars, and where he might possibly be killed, and the result is that he wisely goes to some other colony that has equal advantages to offer and no Kafirs. To suppose that the emigrant would go to Natal when he came to understand that it was an independent settlement of a few white men, living in the midst of a mass of warlike Kafirs, when Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States are all holding out their arms to him, is to suppose him a bigger fool than he is. At the best of times Natal is not likely to attract many desirable emigrants : under a responsible government I do not believe that it will attract any. It seems to me that there is only one condition of affairs under which it would be at all possible for tbe Natalians to assume the responsibilities of self-govern ment with any safety, and that is when the great bulk i'"], [166, "NATAL 82 of the native population has been removed back to whence it came \u2014 Zululand. Causes of a diametrically opposite nature to those that have been at work among tbe natives of Natal have been in operation amongst their brethren in Zululand. In Natal, peace, poly gamy, plenty, and immigration have bred up an enor mous native population. In Zululand, war, private slaughter by the king's order, and the severe restric tions put upon marriage, have kept down the increase of tbe race ; also an enormous number of individuals have fled from the one country into the other. I do not suppose that the population of Zululand amounts, at the present moment, to much more than half that of Natal. In this state of affairs lies the only real key to the Natal native difficulty. Let Zululand be converted into a black colony under English control, and its present inhabitants be established in suitable locations ; then let all the natives of Natal, with the exception of those who choose to become monogamists and be subject to civilised law, be moved into Zululand, and also established in locations. There would be plenty of room for them all. Of course there would be diffi culties in tbe way of the realisation of this scheme, but I do not think that they would prove insuperable. It is probable, however, that it would require a show of force before the Natal natives would consent to budge. Indeed, it is absurd to suppose that anything would induce them to leave peaceful Natal and plunge into the seething cauldron of bloodshed, extortion, and political plots that we have cooked up in Zululand under the name of a settlement. Proper provisions must first be made for tbe government of tbe country,"], [167, "AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. 83 and security to life and property made certain. Till this is done, no natives in their senses will return to Zululand. Till this is done, too, or till some other plan is dis covered by means of which the native difficulty can be effectively dealt with, the Natalians will indeed be foolish if they discard the protection of England, and accept the fatal boon of self-government. If they do, their future career may be brilliant ; but I believe that it will be brief. It is no answer to urge that at present the natives seem quite quiet, and that there is no indication of disturbance. History tells us that before the destruction of doomed Pompeii, Vesuvius was very still ; only day by day tbe dark cloud hanging over the mountain's summit grew denser and blacker. We know what happened to Pompeii. I do not wish to suggest anything unpleasant, far from it ; but sometimes I cannot help thinking that it is perhaps a matter worth the consideration of tbe Natalians whether it might not be as well, instead of talking about responsible government, to improve upon the example of the inhabitants of Pompeii, and take to their ships before the volcano begins to work. It seems to me that there is an ugly cloud gathering on the political horizon in Natal."], [168, ""], [169, "THE TRANSVAAL"], [170, ""], [171, "( 8; ) THE TRANSVAAL. CHAPTEE I. ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. The Transvaal is a country without a history. Its very existence was hardly known of until about fifty years ago. Of its past we know nothing. The genera tions who peopled its great plains have passed utterly out of the memory and even the tradition of man, leaving no monument to mark that they have existed, not even a tomb. During the reign of Chaka, 18 13\u20141828, whose history has been sketched in a previous chapter, one of his most famous generals,' Mosilikatze, surnamed the Lion, seceded from him with a large number of his soldiers, and striking up in a north-westerly direction, settled in or about what is now tbe Morico district of the Transvaal. Tbe country through which Mosilikatze passed was at that time thickly populated with natives of the Basuto or Macatee race, whom tbe Zulus look upon with great contempt. Mosilikatze expressed the feelings of his tribe in a practical manner, by mas sacring every living soul of them that came within"], [172, "88 THE TRANSVAAL. his reach. That the numbers slaughtered were very great, tbe numerous ruins of Basuto kraals all over tbe country testify. It was Chaka's intention to follow up Mosilikatze and destroy him, but he was himself assassinated be fore be could do so. Dingaan, his successor, bow ever, carried out his brother's design, and despatched a large force to punish him. This army, after marching over 300 miles, burst upon Mosilikatze, drove him back with slaughter, and returned home triumphant. The invasion is important, because the Zulus claim the greater part of the Transvaal territory by virtue of it. About the time that Mosilikatze was conquered, 1835\u2014 1840, the discontented Boers were leaving the Cape Colony exasperated at the emancipation of the slaves by the Imperial authorities. First they made their way to Natal, but being followed thither by the English flag they travelled further inland over tbe Vaal Biver and founded the town of Mooi Biver Dorp or Botchefstroom. Here they were joined by other mal contents from the Orange Sovereignty, which, though afterwards abandoned, was at that time a British possession. Acting upon \" The good old rule, the simple plan, Of let him take who has the power, And let him keep who can,\" the Boers now proceeded to possess themselves of as much territory as they wanted. Nor was this a diffi cult task. The country was, as I have said, peopled by Macatees, who are a poor-spirited race as compared to the Zulus, and had bad what little courage they"], [173, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 89 possessed crushed out of them by the rough handling they had received at tbe hands of Mosilikatze and Dingaan. The Boers, they argued, could not treat them worse than the Zulus had done. Occasionally a chief, bolder than the rest, would hold out, and then such an example was made of him and his people that few cared to follow in his footsteps. As soon as the Boers were fairly settled in their new home, they began to think about setting up a Government. First they tried a system of Comman dants, with a Commandant-general, but this does not seem to have answered. Next, those of tbeir number who lived in Lydenburg district (where the gold-fields now are) set up a Bepublic, with a President and Volksraad, or popular assembly. This example was followed by the other white inhabitants of the country, who formed another Bepublic and elected another President, with Pretoria for their capital. The two republics were subsequently incorporated. In 1852 the Imperial authorities, having regard to the expense of maintaining an effective government over an unwilling people in an undeveloped and half conquered country, concluded a convention with the emigrant Boers \" beyond the Vaal Biver.\" Tbe fol lowing were the principal stipulations of this conven tion, drawn up between Major Hogg and Mr. Owen, Her Majesty's Assistant-Commissioners for tbe settling and adjusting of the affairs of the eastern and north eastern boundaries of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope on tbe one part, and a deputation representative of the emigrant farmers north of the Vaal Biver on the other. It was guaranteed \" in the fullest manner on the part of the British Government to tbe emigrant"], [174, "THE TRANSVAAL. 90 farmers beyond the Vaal Biver the right to manage tbeir own affairs, and to govern themselves according to tbeir own laws, without any interference on tbe part of the British Government, and that no encroach ment shall be made by the said Government on the territory beyond to the north of tbe Vaal Biver, with tbe further assurance that the warmest wish of the British Government is to promote peace, free trade, and friendly intercourse with the emigrant farmers now inhabiting, or who hereafter may inhabit that country, it being understood that this system of non interference is binding on both parties.\" Next were disclaimed, on behalf of the British Government, \" all alliances whatever and with whom soever of the coloured nations to the north of tbe Vaal Biver.\" It was also agreed \"that no slavery is or shall be permitted or practised in tbe country to tbe north of the Vaal Biver by tbe emigrant farmers.\" It was further agreed \" that no objection shall be made by any British authority against the emigrant Boers purchasing tbeir supplies of ammunition in any of tbe British colonies and possessions of South Africa ; it being mutually understood that all trade in ammunition with the native tribes is prohibited both by the British Government and tbe emigrant farmers on both sides of the Vaal Biver.\" These were the terms of this famous convention, which is as slipshod in its diction as it is vague in its meaning. What, for instance, is meant by the territory to the north of the Vaal Biver ? According to the letter of tbe agreement, Messrs. Hogg and Owen ceded all tbe territory between the Vaal and Egypt."], [175, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 91 This historical document was the Charta of tbe new born South African Bepublic. Under its provisions, the Boers, now safe from interference on tbe part of the British, established their own Government and promulgated their \" Grond Wet,\" or Constitution. The history of the Bepublic between 1852 and 1876 is not very interesting, and is besides too weari some to enter into here. It consists of an oft-told tale of civil broils, attacks on native tribes, and encroach ment on native territories. Until shortly before the Annexation, every burgher was, on coming of age, en titled to receive from the Government 6000 acres of land. As these rights were in the early days of the Bepublic frequently sold to speculators for such trifles as a bottle of brandy or half a dozen of beer, and as the seller still required his 6000 acres : for a Boer considers it beneath his dignity to settle on less, it is obvious that it required a very large country to satisfy all demands. To meet these demands, the territories of the Bepublic had to be stretched like an elastic band, and they were stretched accordingly, \u2014 at the expense of the natives. The stretching process was an ingenious one, and is very well described in a minute written by Mr. Osborn, the late magistrate at Newcastle, dated 2 2d September 1876, in these words : \u2014 \" The Boers, as they have done in other cases and are still doing, encroached by degrees on native terri tory, commencing by obtaining permission to graze stock upon portions of it at certain seasons of the year, followed by individual graziers obtaining from native headmen a sort of right or license to squat upon certain defined portions, ostensibly in order to"], [176, "THE TRANSVAAL. 92 keep other Boer squatters away from the same land. These licenses, temporarily intended as friendly or neighbourly acts by unauthorised headmen, after a few seasons of occupation by the Boer, are construed by him as title, and his permanent occupation ensues. Damage for trespass is levied by him from the very man from whom be obtained the right to squat, to which the natives submit out of fear of tbe matter reaching the ears of tbe paramount chief, who would in all probability severely punish them for opening tbe door to encroachment by the Boer. After a while, however, the matter comes to a crisis in consequence of the incessant disputes between tbe Boers and tbe natives ; one or other of the disputants lays the case before the paramount chief, who, when bearing both parties, is literally frightened with violence and threats by the Boer into granting him the land. Upon this the usual plan followed by the Boer is at once to collect a few neighbouring Boers, including a field cornet, or even an acting provisional field cornet, appointed by the field cornet or provisional cornet, the latter to represent the Government, although without instructions authorising him to act in tbe matter. A few cattle are collected among themselves, which the party takes to the chief, and bis signature is obtained to a written document alienating to the Bepublican Boers a large slice of all his territory. Tbe contents of this document are, as far as I can make out, never clearly or intelligibly explained to the chief, who signs and accepts of the cattle under tbe impression that it is all in settlement of hire for the grazing licenses granted by his headmen. This, I have no hesitation in saying, is the usual method by which the Boers"], [177, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 93 obtain what they call cessions to them of territories by native chiefs. In Secoc\u0153ni's case they allege that his father Sequati cedes to them the whole of his terri tory (hundreds of square miles) for a hundred head of cattle.\" So rapidly did this process go on that the little Bepublic to the \" North of tbe Vaal Biver \" had at the time of the Annexation grown into a country of the size of France. Its boundaries had only been clearly defined where they abutted on neighbouring White Communities, or on the territories of great native powers, on which the Government had not dared to infringe to any marked degree, such as those of Lo Bengula's people in the north. But wheresoever on the State's borders there had been no white Power to limit its advances, or where tbe native tribes had found themselves too isolated or too weak to resist aggressions, there the Bepublic had by degrees en croached, and extended the shadow, if not the sub stance, of its authority. The Transvaal has a boundary line of over 1600 miles in circumference, and of this a large portion is disputed by different native tribes. Speaking generally, the territory lies between tbe 22\u00b0 and 2 8\u00b0 of South Latitude and the 250 and 3 2\u00b0 of East Longitude, or between the Orange Free State, Natal and Griqualand West on the south, and the Limpopo Biver on the north ; and between the Lebombo mountains on the east, and the Kalihari desert on the west. On tbe north of its territory live three great tribes \u2014 the Makalaka, tbe Matabele, (descendants of the Zulus who deserted Chaka under Mosilikatze), and the Matyana. These tribes are all warlike. On the west, following"], [178, "THE TRANSVAAL. 94 the line down to the Diamond Field territory, are the Sicheli, the Bangoaketsi, the Baralong, and the Koranna tribes. Passing round by Griqualand West, the Free State, and Natal, we reach Zululand on tbe south-east corner; then come the Lebombo mountains on tbe east, separating the Transvaal from Amatonga land, and from tbe so-called Portuguese possessions, which are entirely in tbe bands of native tribes, most of them subject to the great Zulu chief, Umzeila, who has his stronghold in the north-east. It will be observed that the country is almost sur rounded by native tribes. Besides these there are about one million native inhabitants living within its borders. In one district alone, Zoutpansberg, it is computed that there are 364,250 natives, as compared to about 750 whites. If a beautiful and fertile country were alone necessary to make a state and its inhabitants happy and prosperous, happiness and prosperity would rain upon the Transvaal and the Dutch Boers. Tbe capa bilities* of this favoured land are vast and various. Within its borders are to be found highlands and low lands, vast stretches of rolling veldt like gigantic sheep downs, hundreds of miles of swelling busbland, huge tracts of mountainous country, and even little glades spotted with timber that remind one of an English park. There is every possible variety of soil and scenery. Some districts will grow all tropical produce, whilst others are well suited for breeding sheep, cattle, and horses. Most of the districts will produce wheat and all other cereals in greater per fection and abundance than any of tbe other South African colonies. Two crops of cereals may be"], [179, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 95 obtained from the soil every year, and both the vine and tobacco are cultivated with great success. Coffee, sugar-cane, and cotton have been grown with profit in tbe northern parts of the State. Also the un developed mineral wealth of the country is very great. Its known minerals are gold, copper, lead, cobalt, iron, coal, tin, and plumbago : copper and iron having long been worked by the natives. Altogether there is little doubt that the Transvaal is the richest of all the South African states, and had it remained under English rule it would, with the aid of English enterprise and capital, have become a very wealthy and prosperous country. However there is little chance of that now. Perhaps the greatest charm of the Transvaal lies in its climate, which is among the best in tbe world, and in all the southern districts very healthy. During the winter months \u2014 that is, from April to October \u2014 little or no rain falls, and the climate is cold and bracing. In summer it is rather warm, but not over poweringly hot, the thermometer at Pretoria averaging from 65\u00b0 to 730 and in the winter from 590 to 650. The population of the Transvaal is estimated at about 40,000 whites, mostly of Dutch origin, consisting of about thirty vast families ; and one million natives. There are several towns, the largest of which are Pretoria and Potchefstroom. Such is the country that we annexed in 1S77, and were drummed out of in 1881. Now let us turn to its inhabitants. It has been the fashion to talk of the Transvaal as though nobody but Boers lived in it. In reality the inhabitants were divided into three classes : 1. Natives; 2. Boers; 3. English. I say were divided, because the English class can now"], [180, "96 THE TRANSVAAL. hardly be said to exist, the country having been made too hot to bold it since the war. The natives stand in the proportion of nearly twenty to one to the whites. The Boers were in their turn much more numerous than the English, but the latter owned nearly all the trading establishments in the country, and also a very large amount of property. The Transvaal Boers have been very much praised up by members of the Government in England, and others who are anxious to advance their interests, as against English interests. Mr. Gladstone, indeed, can hardly find words strong enough to express his admiration of their leaders, those \"able men,\" since they inflicted a national humiliation on us ; and doubt less they are a people with many good points. That they are not devoid of sagacity can be seen by the way they have dealt with the English Government. The Boers are certainly a peculiar people, though they can hardly be said to be \" zealous of good works.\" They are very religious, but their religion takes its colour from the darkest portions of the Old Testa ment ; lessons of mercy and gentleness are not at all to their liking, and they seldom care to read the Gospels. What they delight in are the stories of wholesale butchery by the Israelites of old ; and in their own position they find a reproduction of that of the first settlers in the Holy Land. Like them they think they are entrusted by the Almighty with the task of exterminating the heathen native tribes around them, and are always ready with a scriptural precedent for slaughter and robbery. Tbe name of the Divinity is continually on their lips, sometimes in connection with very doubtful statements. They are divided"], [181, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 97 into three sects, none of which care much for the other two. These are the Doppers, who number about half the population, the Orthodox Beform, and the Liberal Beform, which is the least numerous. Of these three sects the Doppers are by far the most un compromising and difficult to deal with. They much resemble the Puritans of Charles the First's time, of the extreme Hew-Agag-in-pieces stamp. It is difficult to agree with those who call the Boers cowards, an accusation which the whole of their history belies. A Boer does not like fighting if he can avoid it, because he sets a high value on bis own life ; but if be is cornered, be will fight as well as anybody else. The Boers fought well enough in the late war, though that, it is true, is no great criterion of courage, since they were throughout flushed with victory, and, owing to the poor shooting of the British troops, in but little personal danger. One very un- pleasant characteristic they have, and that is an absence of regard for the truth, especially where land is concerned. Indeed the national characteristic is crystallised into a proverb, \" I am no slave to my word.\" It has several times happened to me to see one set of highly respectable witnesses in a land case go into tbe box and swear distinctly that they saw a beacon placed on a certain spot, whilst an equal number on the other side will swear that they saw it placed a mile away. Filled as they are with a land hunger, to which that of the Irish peasant is a weak and colourless sentiment, there is little that they will not do to gratify tbeir taste. It is tbe subject of constant litigation amongst them, and it is by no means uncommon for a Boer to spend several thousand G"], [182, "THE TRANSVAAL. 98 pounds in lawsuits over a piece of land not worth as many hundreds. Bersonally Boers are fine men, but as a rule ugly. Tbeir women-folk are good-looking in early life, but get very stout as they grow older. They, in common with most of tbeir sex, understand bow to use tbeir tongues ; indeed, it is said that it was the women who caused tbe rising against the English Government. None of the refinements of civilisation enter into tbe life of an ordinary Transvaal Boer. He lives in a way that would shock an English labourer at twenty-five shillings the week, although be is very probably worth fifteen or twenty thousand pounds. His home is but too frequently squalid and filthy to an extraordinary degree. He himself has no education, and does not care that bis children should receive any. He lives by himself in tbe middle of a great plot of land, bis nearest neighbour being perhaps ten or twelve miles away, caring but little for the news of the outside world and nothing for its opinions, doing very little work, but growing daily richer through tbe increase of his flocks and herds. His expenses are almost nothing, and as be gets older wealth increases upon him. Tbe events in his life consist of an occasional trip on \" commando \" against some native tribe, attending a few political meetings, and the journeys he makes with his family to the nearest town, some four times a year, in order to be present at \" Nacbtmaal \" or communion. Foreigners, especially Englishmen, he detests, but be is kindly and hospitable to his own people. Living isolated as be does, the lord of a little kingdom, be naturally comes to have a great idea of himself, and a corresponding contempt for all the rest of mankind."], [183, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 99 Laws and taxes are things distasteful to him, and he looks upon it as an impertinence that any court should venture to call him to account for his doings. He is rich and prosperous, and tbe cares of poverty, and all the other troubles that fall to tbe lot of civilised men, do not affect him. He has no romance in him, nor any of tbe higher feelings and aspirations that are found in almost every other race ; in short, unlike tbe Zulu he despises, there is little of tbe gentleman in his composition, though be is at times capable of acts of kindness and even generosity. His happiness is to live alone in the great wilderness, with his children, his men-servants, and bis maid-servants, bis flocks and his herds, the monarch of all be surveys. If civilisa tion presses him too closely, his remedy is a simple one. He sells bis farm, packs up bis goods and cash in his waggon, and starts for regions more congenially wild. Such are some of tbe leading characteristics of that remarkable product of South Africa, the Transvaal Boer, who resembles no other white man in the world. Berhaps, however, the most striking of all bis oddities is bis abhorrence of aU government, more especially if that government be carried out according to English principles. Tbe Boers have always been more or less in rebellion ; they rebelled against tbe rule of tbe Company when the Cape belonged to Holland, they rebelled against the English Govern- ment in tbe Cape, they were always in a state of semi- rebellion against their own Government in the Trans- vaal, and now they have for tbe second time, with tbe most complete success, rebelled against the English Government. The fact of the matter is that the bulk of their number bate all Governments, because Govern-"], [184, "THE TRANSVAAL. 100 ments enforce law and order, and they bate the English Government worst of all because it enforces law and order most of all. It is not liberty they long for, but license. The \" sturdy independence \" of tbe Boer resolves itself into a determination not to have his affairs interfered with by any superior power what soever, and not to pay taxes if be can possibly avoid it. But he has also a specific cause of complaint against the English Government, which would alone cause him to do bis utmost to get rid of it, and that is its mode of dealing with natives, which is radically opposite to bis own. This is tbe secret of Boer patriotism. To understand it, it must be remembered that the Englishman and tbe Boer look at natives from a very different point of view. Tbe Englishman, though he may not be very fond of him, at any rate regards the Kafir as a fellow human being with feelings like his own. The average Boer does not. He looks upon tbe \" black creature \" as having been delivered into bis band by the \" Lord \" for bis own purposes, that is, to shoot and enslave. He must not be blamed too harshly for this, for, besides being naturally of a somewhat hard disposition, hatred of tbe native is hereditary, and is partly induced by tbe history of many a bloody struggle. Also tbe native bates tbe Boer fully as much as tbe Boer bates tbe native, though with better reason. Now native labour is a necessity to tbe Boer, because he will not as a rule do hard manual labour himself, and there must be some one to plant and garner the crops and herd tbe cattle. On tbe other band, the natives are not anxious to serve the Boers, which means little or no pay and plenty of thick stick, and sometimes worse. Tbe"], [185, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 101 result of this state of affairs is that the Boer often has to rely on forced labour to a very great extent. But this is a thing that an English Government will not tolerate, and the consequence is that under its rule be cannot get the labour that is necessary to him. Then there is the tax question. If he lives under the English flag the money has to be paid regularly, but under his own Government be pays or not as he likes. It was this habit of his of refusing payment of taxes that brought the Bepublic into difficulties in 1877, and that will ere long bring it into trouble again. He cannot understand that cash is necessary to carry on a Government, and looks upon a tax as though it were so much money stolen from him. These things are the real springs of the \" sturdy independence \" and the patriotism of the ordinary Transvaal farmer. Doubtless there are some who are really patriotic ; for instance, one of their leaders, Paul Kruger. But with the majority, patriotism is only another word for unbounded license and forced labour. These remarks must not be taken to apply to the Cape Boers, who are a superior class of men, since they, living under a settled and civilised Government, have been steadily improving, whilst tbeir cousins, living every man for bis own band, have been deterio rating. The old Voortrekkers, the fathers and grand fathers of tbe Transvaal Boer of to-day, were, without doubt, a very fine set of men, and occasionally you may in the Transvaal meet individuals of the same stamp whom it is a pleasure to know. But these are generally men of a certain age, with some experience of the world ; the younger men are very objectionable in their manners."], [186, "THE TRANSVAAL. 102 The real Dutch Batriotic party is not to be found in the Transvaal, but in tbe Cape Colony. Their object, which, as affairs now are, is well within the bounds of possibility, is by fair means or foul to swamp the English element in South Africa, and to establish a great Dutch Bepublic. It was this party, which consists of clever and well educated men, who raised tbe outcry against tbe Transvaal Annexation, because it meant an enormous extension of English influence, and who had the wit, by means of their emissaries and newspapers, to work upon tbe feeling of the ignorant Transvaal farmers until they persuaded them to rebel ; and finally, to avail themselves of tbe yearnings of English radicalism for the disruption of the Empire and the minimisation of British authority, to get the Annexation cancelled. All through this business the Boers have more or less danced in obedi ence to strings pulled at Cape Town, and it is now said that one of the chief wire-pullers, Mr. Hofmeyer, is to be asked to become President of tbe Bepublic. These men are the real patriots of South Africa, and very clever ones too \u2014 not the Transvaal Boers, who vapour about their blood and their country and the accursed Englishman to order, and are in reality influenced by very small motives, such as tbe desire to avoid payment of taxes, or to bunt away a neigh bouring Englishman, whose civilisation and refinement are as offensive as his farm is desirable. Such are the Dutch inhabitants of tbe Transvaal. I will now give a short sketch of their institutions as they were before the Annexation, and to which the community has reverted since its recision, with, I believe, but few alterations."], [187, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 103 The form of government is republican, and to all intents and purposes manhood suffrage prevails, supreme power resting in the people. Tbe executive power of the State centres in a Bresident elected by the people to bold office for a term of five years, every voter having a voice in his election. He is assisted in the execution of bis duties by an Executive Council, consisting of the State Secretary and sucb other three members as are selected for that purpose by the legis- lative body, the Volksraad. The State Secretary holds office for four years, and is elected by the Volks- raad. The members of the Executive have all seats in the Volksraad, but have no votes. The Volksraad is the legislative body of the State, and consists of forty-two members. Tbe country is divided into twelve electoral districts, each of which has the right to return three members ; the Gold Fields have also tbe right of electing two members, and the four prin- cipal towns one member each. There is no power in the State competent to either prorogue or dissolve the Volksraad except that body itself, so that an appeal to the country on a given subject or policy is impossible without its concurrence. Members are elected for four years, but half retire by rotation every two years, the vacancies being filled by re-elections. Members must have been voters for three years, and be not less than thirty years of age, must belong to a Protestant Church, be resident in the country, and owners of immovable property therein. A father and son cannot sit in the same Baad, neither can seats be occupied by coloured persons, bastards, or officials. For each electoral district there is a magistrate or Landdrost, whose duties are similar to those of a Civil"], [188, "THE TRANSVAAL. 104 Commissioner. These districts are again subdivided into wards presided over by field cornets, who exercise judicial powers in minor matters, and in times of war have considerable authority. Tbe Boman Dutch law is the common law of the country, as it is of tbe colonies of the Cape of Good Hope and Natal, and of the Orange Free State. Prior to the Annexation justice was administered in a very primitive fashion. First, there was the Landdrosts' Court, from which an appeal lay to a court consisting of the Landdrost and six councillors elected by tbe public. This was a court of first instance as well as a court of appeal. Then there was a Supreme Court, consisting of three Landdrosts from three dif ferent districts, and a jury of twelve selected from the burghers of the State. There was no appeal from this court, but cases have sometimes been brought under the consideration of the Volksraad as tbe supreme power. It is easy to imagine what the administration of justice was like when the presidents of all the law courts in the country were elected by the mob, not on account of their knowledge of tbe law, but because they were popular. Suitors before the old Transvaal courts found the law surprisingly uncertain. A High Court of Justice was, however, established after the Annexation, and has been continued by tbe Volks raad, but an agitation is being got up against it, and it will possibly be abolished in favour of tbe old system. In such a community as that of the Transvaal Boers the question of public defence was evidently of the first importance. This is provided for under what is known as the Commando system. The President,"], [189, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 105 with the concurrence of the Executive Council, has the right of declaring war, and of calling up a com- mando, in which the burghers are placed under the field cornets and commandants. These last are chosen by the field cornets for each district, and a Com- mandant-general is chosen by the whole laager or force, but the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the army. All the inhabitants of the State between sixteen and sixty, with a few exceptions, are liable for service. Young men under eighteen, and men over fifty, are only called out under circumstances of emergency. Members of the Volksraad, officials, clergymen, and school-teachers are exempt from per- sonal service, unless martial law is proclaimed, but must contribute an amount not exceeding \u00a31 5 towards the expense of the war. All legal proceedings in civil cases are suspended against persons on com- mando, no summonses can be made out, and as soon as martial law is proclaimed no legal execution can be prosecuted, the pounds are closed, and transfer dues payments are suspended until after thirty days from the recall of the proclamation of martial law. Owners of land residing beyond the borders of tbe Bepublic are also liable, in addition to the ordinary war tax, to place a fit and proper substitute at the disposal of tbe Government, or otherwise to pay a fine of .\u00a315. The first levy of the burghers is, of men from eighteen to thirty-four years of age ; tbe second, thirty-four to fifty; and the third, from sixteen to eighteen, and from fifty to sixty years. Every man is bound to provide himself with clothing, a gun, and ammunition, and there must be enough waggons and oxen found between them to suffice for their joint use. Of tbe"], [190, "106 THE TRANSVAAL. booty taken, one quarter goes to Government, and the rest to tbe burghers. The most disagreeable part of the commandeering system is, however, yet to come ; personal service is not all that the resident in tbe Transvaal Bepublic has to endure. The right is vested in field cornets to commandeer articles as well as individuals, and to call upon inhabitants to furnish requisites for the commando. As may be imagined, it goes very hard on these occasions with the property of any individual whom tbe field cornet may not happen to like. Each ward is expected to turn out its contingent ready and equipped for war, and this can only be done by seizing goods right and left. One unfortunate will have to find a waggon, another to deliver over CO ' his favourite span of trek oxen, another his riding horse or some slaughter cattle, and so on. Even when the officer making the levy is desirous of doing bis duty as fairly as be can, it is obvious that very great hardships must be inflicted under such a system. Bequisitions are made more with regard to what is wanted than with a view to an equitable distribution of demands ; and like the Jews in the time of the Crusades, he wbo has got most must pay most, or take the consequences, which may be unpleasant. Articles which are not perishable, such as waggons, are sup posed to be returned, but if they come back at all they are generally worthless. In case of war, the native tribes living within the borders of the State are also expected to furnish con tingents, and it is on them that most of the hard work of the campaign generally falls. They are put in the front of the battle, and have to do tbe hand-"], [191, "ITS INHABITANTS, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS. 107 to-hand fighting, which, however, if of the Zulu race, they do not object to. The revenue of tbe State is so arranged that the burden of it should fall as much as possible on the trading community, and as little as possible on the farmer. It is chiefly derived from licenses on trades, professions, and callings, 30s. per annum quit-rent on farms, transfer dues and stamps, auction dues, court fees, and contributions from such native tribes as can be made to pay them. Since we have given up the country, the Volksraad has put a very heavy tax on all imported goods, hoping thereby to beguile the Boers into paying taxes without knowing it, and at tbe same time strike a blow at tbe trading community, which is English in its proclivities. The result has been to paralyse what little trade there was left in the country, and to cause great dissatisfaction amongst the farmers, who cannot understand why, now that the English are gone, they should have to pay twice as much for their sugar and coffee as they have been accustomed to do. I will conclude this chapter with a few words about tbe natives who swarm in and around the Transvaal. They can be roughly divided into two great races, tbe Amazulu and their offshoots, and the Macatee or Basuto tribes. All those of Zulu blood, including the Swazis, Mapock's Kafirs, the Matabele, tbe Knob noses, and others are very warlike in disposition, and men of fine physique. The Basutos (who must not be confounded with the Cape Basutos), however, differ from these tribes in every respect, including their lan guage, which is called Sisutu, the only mutual feeling between tbe two races being tbeir common detestation"], [192, "108 THE TRANSVAAL. of the Boers. They do not love war ; in fact, they are timid and cowardly by nature, and only fight when they are obliged to. Unlike the Zulus, they are much addicted to the arts of peace, show consider able capacities for civilisation, and are even willing to become Christians. There would have been a far better field for tbe Missionary in the Transvaal than in Zululand and Natal. Indeed, the most successful mission station I have seen in Africa is near Middle burg, under the control of Mr. Merensky. In person tbe Basutos are thin and weakly when compared to the stalwart Zulu, and it is their consciousness of inferiority both to tbe white men and their black brethren that, together with their natural timidity, makes them submit as easily as they do to the yoke of tbe Boer."], [193, "109 CHAPTEB II. EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. In or about tbe year 1872, the burghers of the Bepublic elected Mr. Burgers tbeir Bresident. This remarkable man was a native of tbe Cape Colony, and passed the first sixteen or seventeen years of bis life, be once in formed me, on a farm herding sheep. He afterwards became a clergyman noted for tbe eloquence of bis preaching, but bis ideas proving too broad for his con gregation, he resigned his cure, and in an evil moment for himself took to politics. President Burgers was a man of striking presence and striking talents, especially as regards his oratory, which was really of a very high class, and would have commanded attention in our own House of Commons. He possessed, however, a mind of that peculiarly vola tile order that is sometimes met with in conjunction with great talents, and which seems to be entirely with out ballast. His intellect was of a balloon-like nature, and as incapable of being steered. He was always soaring in the clouds, and, as is natural to one in that elevated position, taking a very different and more sanguine view of affairs to that which men of a more lowly, and perhaps a more practical, turn of mind would do."], [194, "THE TRANSVAAL. 110 But notwithstanding bis fly-away ideas, President Burgers was undoubtedly a true patriot, labouring night and day for tbe welfare of the State of which he had undertaken the guidance ; but bis patriotism was too exalted for his surroundings. He wished to elevate to the rank of a nation a people who bad not got the desire to be elevated ; with this view he contracted railway loans, made wars, minted gold, &c, and then suddenly discovered that tbe country refused to support him. In short, he was made of very different clay to that of the people he had to do with. He dreamt of a great Dutch Bepublic \" with eight millions of inhabi tants,\" doing a vast trade with the interior through tbe Delagoa Bay Bailway. They, on the other band, cared nothing about republics or railways, but fixed their affections on forced labour and getting rid of tbe neces sity of paying taxes \u2014 and so between them the Bepub lic came to grief. But it must be borne in mind that President Burgers was throughout actuated by good motives ; be did his best by a stubborn and a stiff-necked people ; and if be failed, as fail be did, it was more their fault than his. As regards the pension he received from the English Government, which has so often been brought up against him, it was after all no more than his due after five years of arduous work. If the Bepublic bad continued to exist, it is to be presumed that they would have made some provision for their old Bresident, more especially as he seems to have exhausted bis private means in paying the debts of the country. What ever may be said of some of the other officials of tbe Bepublic, its President was, I believe, an honest man. In 1875, Mr. Burgers proceeded to Europe, having, he says in a posthumous document recently published,"], [195, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 111 been empowered by the Volksraad \" to carry out my plans for the development of the country, by opening up a direct communication for it, free from the tram- mels of British ports and influence.\" According to this document, during bis absence two powerful parties, viz., \"tbe faction of unprincipled fortune-hunters, rascals, and runaways on the one band, and the faction of the extreme orthodox party in a certain branch of the Dutch Beform Church on the other, began to co-operate against the Government of tbe Bepublic and me per- sonally Ill as I was, and contrary to the advice of my medical men, I proceeded to Europe, in the be- ginning of 1875, to carry out my project, and no sooner was my back turned on the Transvaal than the con- spiring elements began to act. The new coat of arms and flag adopted _ in the Baad by an almost unanimous vote were abolished; the laws for a free and secular education were tampered with; and my resistance to a reckless inspection and disposal of Government lands, still occupied by natives, was openly defied. The Baad, filled up to a large extent with men of ill repute, who, under the cloak of progress and favour to the Government view, obtained their seats, was too weak to cope with the skill of the conspirators, and granted leave to the acting President to carry out measures diametrically opposed to my policy. Native lands were inspected and given out to a few speculators, who held large numbers of claims to lauds which were destined for citizens, and so a war was prepared for me, on my return from Europe, which I could not avert.\" This extract is interesting, as showing tbe state of feeling existing between tbe President and his officers previous to tbe outbreak of the Secoc\u0153ni war. It also shows"], [196, "THE TRANSVAAL. 112 how entirely be was out of sympathy with the citizens, seeing that, as soon as his back was turned, they, with Mr. Joubert and Paul Kruger at tbeir bead, at once undid all the little good be had done. When Mr. Burgers got to England, be found that city capitalists would have nothing whatever to say to bis railway scheme. In Holland, however, be succeeded in getting^90,000 of tbe be wished to borrow at a high rate of interest, and by passing a bond on five hundred Government farms. This money was immediately invested in railway plant, which, when it arrived at Delagoa Bay, bad to be mortgaged to pay tbe freight on it, and that was tbe end of tbe Delagoa Bay railway scheme, except that tbe ;\u00a3 90,000 is, I believe, still owing to tbe confiding shareholders in Holland. On bis return to tbe Transvaal tbe President was well received, and for a month or so all went smoothly. But the relations of the Bepublic with the surrounding native tribes bad by this time become so bad that an explosion was imminent somewhere. In tbe year 1874 tbe Volksraad raised the price of passes under the iniquitous pass law, by which every native travelling through the territory was made to pay from to \u00a35. In case of non-payment tbe native was made subject to a fine of from \u00a31 to \u00a310, and to a beating of from \"ten to twenty-five lashes.\" He was also to go into service for three months, and have a certificate thereof, for which be must pay five shillings ; the avowed object of tbe law being to obtain a supply of Kafir labour. This was done in spite of the earnest protest of the President, who gave tbe Baad distinctly to understand that by accepting this law they would, in point of fact, annul"], [197, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 113 treaties concluded with the chiefs on the south-western borders. It is not clear, however, if this amended pass law ever came into force. It is to be hoped it did not, for even under the old law natives were shamefully treated by Boers, who would pretend that they were authorised by Government to collect tbe tax; the result being that the unfortunate Kafir was frequently obliged to pay twice over. Natives had such a horror of the pass laws of the country, that when travelling to the Diamond Fields to work they would frequently go round some hundreds of miles rather than pass through tbe Transvaal. That tbe Volksraad should have thought it necessary to enact such a law in order that the farmers should obtain a supply of Kafir labour in a territory that bad nearly a million of native inhabitants, who, unlike tbe Zulus, are willing to work if only they meet with decent treatment, is in itself an instructive commentary on the feelings existing between Boer master and Kafir servant. But besides the general quarrel with the Kafir race in its entirety, which the Boers always have on hand, they had just then several individual differences, in each of which there lurked the possibilities of disturbance. To begin with, their relations with Cetywayo were by no means amicable. During Mr. Burgers' absence the Boer Government, then under the leadership of P. J. Joubert, sent Cetywayo a very stern message \u2014 a message that gives the reader the idea that Mr. Joubert was ready to enforce it with ten thousand men. After makin\u00b0- various statements and demands with reference to tbe Amaswazi tribe, the disputed boundary line, &c, it ends thus : \u2014 ii"], [198, "THE TRANSVAAL. 114 \"Although the Government of the South African Bepublic has never wished, and does not now desire, that serious disaffection and animosities should exist between you and them, yet it is not the less of tbe greatest consequence and importance for you earnestly to weigh these matters and risks, and to satisfy them ; tbe more so, if you on your side also wish that peace and friendship shall be maintained between you and us.\" The Secretary for Native Affairs for Natal comments on this message in these words : \" The tone of this message to Cetywayo is not very friendly, it has the look of an ultimatum, and if tbe Government of the Transvaal were in circumstances different to what it is, the message would suggest an intention to coerce if the demands it conveys are not at once complied with ; but I am inclined to the opinion that no such intention exists, and that tbe transmission of a copy of the mes sage to the Natal Government is intended as a notifica tion that the Transvaal Government has proclaimed the territory hitherto in dispute between it and the Zulus to be Bepublican territory-, and that the Bepublic intends to occupy it.\" In the territories marked out by a decision known as tbe Keate Award, in which Lieutenant-Governor Keate of Natal, at the request of both parties, laid down the boundary line between the Boers and certain native tribes, the Boer Government carried it with a yet higher hand, insomuch as the natives of those districts, bein\u00ab comparatively unwarlike, were less likely to resist. On the 18th August 1875, Acting President Joubert issued a proclamation by which a line was laid down far to the southward of that marked out by Mr. Keate,"], [199, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 115 and consequently included more territory within the elastic boundaries of the Bepublic. A Government notice of tbe same date invites all claiming lands now declared to belong to tbe Bepublic to send in their claims to be settled by a land commission. On the 6th March 1876, another chief in the same neighbourhood (Montsoia) writes to the Lieutenant- Governor of Griqualand West in these terms : \u2014 \" My Fkiend, \u2014 I wish to acquaint you with the doings of some people connected with the Boers. A man-servant of mine has been severely injured in the head by one of the Boers' servants, which has proved fatal. Another of my people has been cruelly treated by a Boer tying a rein about his neck, and then mounting his borse and dragging him about the place. My brother Molema, who is tbe bearer of this, will give you full particulars.\" Molema explains the assaults thus : \" Tbe assaulted man is not dead ; his skull was fractured. The assault was committed by a Boer named Wessels Badenborst, who shamefully ill-treated the man, beat him till be fainted, and, on bis revival, fastened a rim round his neck, and made him run to the homestead by the side of his (Badenborst's) borse cantering. At the home stead be tied him to the waggon-wheel, and flogged him again till Mrs. Badenhorst stopped her husband.\" Though it will be seen that the Boers were on good terms neither with the Zulus nor the Keate Award natives, they still had one Kafir ally, namely, Um bandeni, tbe Amaswazi king. This alliance was con cluded under circumstances so peculiar that they are worthy of a brief recapitulation. It appears that in the winter of tbe year 1875, Mr. Eudolph, the Land-"], [200, "THE TRANSVAAL. 116 drost of Utrecht, went to Swaziland, and, imitating the example of tbe Natal Government with Cety wayo, crowned Umbandeni king, on behalf of the Boer Government. He further made a treaty of alliance with him, and promised him a commando to help him in case of bis being attacked by the Zulus. Now comes tbe curious part of tbe story. On tbe 1 8th May 1876, a message came from this same Umbandeni to Sir H. Bulwer, of which tbe following is an extract: \u2014 \"We are sent by our king to thank the Government of Natal for tbe information sent to him last winter by that Government, and conveyed by Mr. Budolpb, of the intended attack on bis people by tbe Zulus. We are further instructed by the king to thank tbe Natal Government for the influence it used to stop the intended raid, and for instructing a Boer commando to go to bis country to render him assistance in case of need ; and further for appointing Mr. Budolpb at the head of tbe commando to place him (Umbandeni) as king over tbe Amaswazi, and to make a treaty with him and his people on be half of tbe Natal Government. . . . Tbe Transvaal Government has asked Umbandeni to acknowledge himself a subject of the Bepublic, but he has dis tinctly refused to do so.\" In a minute written on this subject, the Secretary for Native Affairs for Natal says, \"No explanation or assurance from me was sufficient to convince them (Umbandeni's messengers) that they had on that occasion made themselves sub jects of the South African Bepublic ; they declared it was not tbeir wish or intention to do so, and that they would refuse to acknowledge a position into which they bad been unwittingly betrayed.\" I must"], [201, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 117 conclude this episode by quoting the last paragraph of Sir H. Bulwer's covering despatch, because it con cerns larger issues than the supposed treaty : \" It will not be necessary that I should at present add any remarks to those contained in the minute of the Secretary for Native Affairs, but I would observe that the situation arising out of the relations of the Government of the South African Bepublic with tbe neighbouring native States is so complicated, and pre sents so many elements of confusion and of danger to the peace of this portion of South Africa, that I trust some way may be found to an early settlement of questions that ought not, in my opinion, to be left alone, as so many have been left, to take the chance of the future.\" And now I come to the last and most imminent native difficulty that at the time faced the Bepublic. On the borders of Lydenburg district there lived a powerful chief named Secoc\u0153ni. Between this chief and the Transvaal Government difficulties arose in tbe beginning of 1876 on the usual subject \u2014 land. The Boers declared that they had bought tbe land from the Swazis, who ,had conquered portions of the country, and that the Swazis offered to make it \" clean from brambles,\" i.e., kill everybody living on it; but that they (tbe Boers) said that they were to let them be, that they might be their servants. The Basutos, on the other band, said that no such sale ever took place, and, even if it did take place, it was invalid, because the Swazis were not in occupation of the land, and therefore could not sell it. It was a Christian Kafir called Johannes, a brother of Secoc\u0153ni, who was the immediate cause of the war. This Johannes used to"], [202, "118 THE TRANSVAAL. live at a place called Botsobelo, tbe mission-station of Mr. Merensky, but moved to a stronghold on the Spek boom river, in tbe disputed territory. Tbe Boers sent to him to come back, but be refused, and warned tbe Boers off bis land. Secoc\u0153ni was then appealed to, but declared that the land belonged to bis tribe, and would be occupied by Johannes. He also told tbe Boers \" that be did not wish to fight, but that be was quite ready to do so if they preferred it.\" Thereupon the Transvaal Government declared war, although it does not appear that tbe natives committed any out rage or acts of hostility before tbe declaration. As regards the Boers' right to Secoc\u0153ni's country, Sir H. Barkly sums up the question thus, in a despatch addressed to Bresident Burgers, dated 28th Nov. 1876: \u2014 \" On the whole, it seems perfectly clear, and I feel bound to repeat it, that Sikukuni was neither de jure or de facto a subject of the Bepublic when your Honour declared war against him in June last.\" As soon as war had been declared, the clumsy commando system was set working, and about 2500 white men collected ; the Swazis also were applied to to send a contingent, which they did, being only too glad of the opportunity of slaughter. At first all went well, and the President, who accom panied the commando in person, succeeded in reducing a mountain stronghold, which, in bis high-flown way, be called a \" glorious victory \" over a \" Kafir Gibraltar.\" On the 14th July another engagement took place, when the Boers and Swazis attacked Johannes' strong bold. Tbe place was taken with circumstances of great barbarity by the Swazis, for when tbe signal was given to advance tbe Boers did not move. Nearly"], [203, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 119 all the women were killed, and the brains of the chil dren were dashed out against the stones ; in one instance, before the captive mother's face. Johannes was badly wounded, and died two days afterwards. When be was dying, he said to his brother, \" I am going to die. I am thankful I do not die by the bands of these cowardly Boers, but by tbe hand of a black and courageous nation like myself . . .\" He then took leave of bis people, told bis brother to read the Bible, and expired. The Swazis were so infuriated at the cowardice dis played by tbe Boers on this occasion that they returned borne in great dudgeon. On the 2d of August Secoc\u0153ni's mountain, which is a very strong fortification, was attacked in two columns, or rather an attempt was made to attack it, for when it came to tbe pinch only about forty men, mostly English and Germans, would advance. Thereupon the whole commando retreated with great haste, the greater part of it going straight home. In vain the President entreated them to shoot him rather than desert him ; they had had enough of Secoc\u0153ni and his stronghold, and home they went. The President then retreated with what few men he had left to Steelport, where he built a fort, and from thence returned to Pretoria. The news of the collapse of tbe commando was received throughout the Transvaal, and indeed the whole of South Africa, with the greatest dismay. For the first time in the history of that country the white man had been completely worsted by a native tribe, and that tribe wretched Basutos, people whom tbe Zulus, call their \" dogs.\" It was glad tidings to every native from the Zambesi to the Cape, who learnt thereby that tbe white man was not so invincible as be used to be."], [204, "THE TRANSVAAL. 120 Meanwhile tbe inhabitants of Lydenburg were filled with alarm, and again and again petitioned tbe Governors of the Cape and Natal for assistance. Their fears were, however, to a great extent groundless, for, with the exception of occasional cattle-lifting, Secoc\u0153ni did not follow up bis victory. On the 4th September tbe Bresident opened tbe special sitting of tbe Volksraad, and presented to that body a scheme for the establishment of a border force to take the place of tbe commando system, announcing that be had appointed a certain Captain Von Schlick mann to command it. He also requested the Baad to make some provision for tbe expenses of the expedition, which they had omitted to do in tbeir former sitting. Captain Von Schlickmann determined to carry on the war upon a different system. He got together a band of very rough characters on the Diamond Fields, and occupied the fort built by tbe President, from whence he would sally out from time to time and destroy kraals. He seems, if we may believe the re ports in the blue-books and tbe stories of eye-witnesses, to have carried on bis proceedings in a somewhat savage way. The following is an extract from a private letter written by one of his volunteers : \u2014 \" About daylight we came across four Kafirs. Saw them first, and charged in front of them to cut off tbeir retreat. Saw they were women, and called out not to fire. In spite of that, one of the poor things got her head blown off (a d d shame). . . . Afterwards two women and a baby were brought to the camp prisoners.

Told him distinctly he was a d d coward.\" Scblickmann was, however, a mild-mannered man when compared to a certain Abel Erasmus, afterwards denounced at a public dinner by Sir Garnet Wolseley as a fiend \" in human form.\" This gentleman, in tbe month of October, attacked a friendly kraal of Kafirs. The incident is described thus in a correspondent's letter : \u2014 \" The people of the kraals, taken quite by surprise, fled when they saw their foes, and most of them took shelter in tbe neighbouring bush. Two or three men were distinctly seen in their flight from the kraal, and one of them is known to have been wounded. Accord ing to my informant the remainder were women and children, who were pursued into the bush, and there, all shivering and shrieking, were put to death by the Boers' Kafirs, some being shot, but the majority stabbed with assegais. After the massacre he counted thirteen women and three children, but he says he did not see the body of a single man. Another Kafir said, pointing to a place in the road where tbe stones were thickly strewn, ' the bodies of the women and children lay like these stones.' The Boer before mentioned, who has been stationed outside, has told one of his own friends, whom be thought would not mention it, that the shrieks were fearful to bear.\" Several accounts of, or allusion to, this atrocity can be found in the blue-books, and I may add that it, in common with others of the same stamp, was the talk of the country at the time."], [206, "THE TRANSVAAL. 122 I do not relate these horrors out of any wish to rake up old stories to the prejudice of the Boers, but because I am describing the state of the country before the Annexation, in which they form an interesting and important item. Also, it is as well that people in England should know into what bands they have delivered over tbe native tribes who trusted in tbeir protection. What happened in 1876 is probably hap pening again now, and will certainly happen again and again. The character of the Transvaal Boer and his sentiments towards tbe native races have not modified during the last five years, but, on the contrary, a large amount of energy, which has been accumulating during the period of British protection, will now be expended on their devoted beads. As regards the truth of these atrocities, tbe majority of them are beyond tbe possibility of doubt ; indeed, to the best of my knowledge, no serious attempt has ever been made to refute such of them as have come into public notice, except in a general way, for party pur poses. As, however, they may be doubted, I will quote the following extract from a despatch written by Sir H. Barkly to Lord Carnarvon, dated i8tb December 1876:\u2014 \"As Von Scblickmann has since fallen fighting bravely, it is not without reluctance that I join in affixing this dark stain on his memory, but truth compels me to add the following extract from a letter which I have since received from one whose name (which I communicate to your Lordship privately) forbids disbelief : ' There is no longer the slightest doubt as to the murder of the two women and the child at Steelport by tbe direct order of Scblickmann, and in"], [207, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 123 tbe attack on tbe kraal near which these women were captured (or some attack about that period) be ordered his men to cut tbe throats of all tbe wounded !

Injustice, cruelty, and rapine have always been the watchwords of tbe Transvaal Boers. The stories of wholesale slaughter in the earlier days of the Bepublic are very numerous. One of the best known of those shocking occurrences took place in the Zoutpansberg war in 1865. On this occasion a large nuniber of Kafirs took refuge in caves, where the Boers smoked them to death. Some years afterwards Dr. Wangeman, whose account is, I believe, thoroughly reliable, describes tbe scene of tbeir operations in these words : \u2014 \" Tbe roof of the first cave was black with smoke ; the remains of the logs which were burnt lay at the entrance. The floor was strewn with hundreds of skulls and skeletons. In confused heaps lay karosses, kernes, assegais, pots, spoons, snuff-boxes, and the bones of men, giving one the impression that this was tbe grave of a whole people. Some estimate the number of those who perished here from twenty to thirty thousand. This 1 The italics are my own. \u2014 Author."], [208, "THE TRANSVAAL. 124 is, I believe, too high. In the one chamber there were from two hundred to three hundred skeletons ; the other chambers I did not visit.\" In 1868 a public meeting was held at Potchefstroom to consider tbe war then going on with tbe Zoutpans berg natives. According to the report of the proceed ings, tbe Bev. Mr. Ludorf said that \"on a particular occasion a number of native children, who were too young to be removed, had been collected in a heap, covered with long grass, and burned alive. Other atrocities had also been committed, but these were too horrible to relate.\" When called upon to produce his authority for this statement, Mr. Ludorf named bis authority \" in a solemn declaration to the State Attor ney.\" At this same meeting Mr. J. G. Steyn, who had been Landdrost of Botchefstroom, said, \" there now was innocent blood on our hands which bad not yet been avenged, and the curse of God rested on the land in consequence.\" Mr. Bosalt remarked that \"it was a singular circumstance that in tbe different colonial Kafir wars, as also in tbe Basuto wars, one did not hear of destitute children being found by tbe commandoes, and asked how it was that every petty commando that took tbe field in this Bepublic invariably found num bers of destitute children. He gave it as bis opinion that the present system of apprenticeship was an essen tial cause of our frequent hostilities with the natives.\" Mr. Jan Talyard said, \"Children were forcibly taken from their parents, and were then called destitute and apprenticed.\" Mr. Daniel Van Nooren was heard to say, \" If they bad to clear the country, and could not have the children they found, be would sboot them.\" Mr. Field- Cornet Furstenburg stated \"that when he"], [209, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 125 was at Zoutpansberg with bis burghers, tbe chief Katse- Kats was told to come down from tbe mountains ; that he sent one of bis subordinates as a proof of amity ; that whilst a delay of five days was guaranteed by Commandant Paul Kruger, who was then in command, orders were given at tbe same, time to attack tbe natives at break of day, which was accordingly done, but which resulted in total failure.\" Truly, this must have been an interesting meeting. Before leaving these unsavoury subjects, I must touch on the question of slavery. It has been again and again denied, on behalf of tbe Transvaal Boers, that slavery existed in the Bepublic. Now, this is, strictly speaking, true ; slavery did not exist, but apprentice ship did \u2014 the rose was called by another name, that is all. Tbe poor destitute children who were picked up by kind-hearted Boers, after the extermination of their parents, were apprenticed to farmers till they came of age. It is a remarkable fact that these children never attained tbeir majority. You might meet oldish men in tbe Transvaal who were not, according to their masters' reckoning, twenty-one years of age. The asser tion that slavery did not exist in tbe Transvaal is only made to hoodwink the English public. I have known men who have owned slaves, and who have seen whole waggon-loads of \" black ivory,\" as they were called, sold for about \u00a315 a-piece. I have at this moment a tenant, Carolus by name, on some land I own in Natal, now a well-to-do man, who was for many years \u2014 about twenty, if I remember right \u2014 a Boer slave. During those years, be told me, be worked from morning till ni\u00b0*ht, and the only reward be received was two calves. He finally escaped into Natal."], [210, "126 THE TRANSVAAL. If other evidence is needed it is not difficult to find, so I will quote a little. On tbe 22d August 1876 we find Khama, king of the Bamangwato, one of tbe most worthy chiefs in South Africa, sending a message to \" Victoria, tbe great Queen of tbe English people,\" in these words : \u2014 \" I write to you, Sir Henry, in order that your Queen may preserve for me my country, it being in her hands. The Boers are coming into it, and I do not like them. Tbeir actions are cruel among us black people. We are like money, they sell us and our children. I ask Her Majesty to pity me, and to bear that which I write quickly. I wish to hear upon what conditions Her Majesty will receive me, and my country and my people, under her protection. I am weary with fighting. I do not like war, and I ask Her Majesty to give me peace. I am very much distressed that my people are being destroyed by war, and I wish them to obtain peace. I ask Her Majesty to defend me, as she defends all her people. There are three things which distress me very much \u2014 war, selling people, and drink. All these things I shall find in tbe Boers, and it is these things which destroy people to make an end of them in tbe country-. The custom of the Boers has always been to cause people to be sold, and to-day they are still selling people. Last year I saw them pass with two waggons full of people whom they had bought at the river at Tanane \" (Lake Ngate). The Special Correspondent of the Cape Argus, a highly respectable journal, writes thus on tbe 28th November 1876: \u2014 \"The Boer from whom this infor mation was gleaned has furnished besides some facts which may not be uninteresting, as a commentary on"], [211, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 127 the repeated denials by Mr. Burgers of the existence of slavery. During the last week slaves have been offered for sale on his farm. The captives have been taken from Secoc\u0153ni's country by Mapoch's people, and are being exchanged at the rate of a child for a heifer. He also assures us that the whole of the High veld is being replenished with Kafir children, whom the Boers have been lately purchasing from the Swazis at the rate of a borse for a child. I should like to see tins man and his father as witnesses before an Imperial Commission. He let fall one or two incidents of the past which were brought to mind by tbe occurrences of the present. In 1864, be says, 'The Swazis accom panied tbe Boers against Males. The Boers did nothing but stand by and witness the fearful massacre. Tbe men and women were also murdered. One poor woman sat clutching her baby of eight days old. The Swazis stabbed her through the body, and when she found that she could not live, she wrung the baby's neck with her own bands to save it from future misery. On the return of that commando the children who became too weary to continue the journey were killed on the road. The survivors were sold as slaves to the farmers.' \" The same gentleman writes in the issue of tbe 12th December as follows: \u2014 \"The whole world may know it, for it is true, and investigation will only bring out the horrible details, that through the whole course of this Bepublic's existence it has acted in contravention of the Sand Biver Treaty; and slavery has occurred not only here and there in isolated cases, but as an unbroken practice, and has been one of tbe peculiar institutions of tbe country, mixed up with all its social and political life. It has been at the root of most of"], [212, "128 THE TRANSVAAL. its wars. It has been carried on regularly even in times of peace. It has been characterised by all those circumstances which have so often roused tbe British nation to an indignant protest, and to repeated efforts to banisb tbe slave trade from the world. Tbe Boers have not only fallen on unsuspecting kraals simply for tbe purpose of obtaining the women and children and cattle, but they have carried on a traffic through natives who have kidnapped tbe children of their weaker neighbours, and sold them to tbe white man. Again, the Boers have sold and exchanged their victims among themselves. Waggon-loads of slaves have been conveyed from one end of tbe country to tbe other for sale, and that with tbe cognisance of, and for tbe direct advantage of, tbe highest officials of tbe land. The writer has himself seen in a town, situated in the south of the Bepublic, tbe children who bad been brought down from a remote northern district. One fine morn- ing, in walking through tbe streets, he was struck with tbe number of little black strangers standing about certain bouses, and wondered where they could have come from. He learnt a few hours later that they were part of loads which were disposed of on the outskirts of the town tbe day before. The circumstances con- nected with some of these kidnapping excursions are appalling, and the barbarities practised by cruel masters upon some of these defenceless creatures during tbe course of tbeir servitude are scarcely less horrible than those reported from Turkey. It is no disgrace in this country for an official to ride a fine borse which was got for two Kafir children, to procure whom the father and mother were shot. No reproach is inherited by tbe mistress who, day after day, tied up her female"], [213, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 129 servant in an agonising posture, and had her beaten until there was no sound part in her body, securing her in the stocks during the intervals of torture. That man did not lose caste who tied up another woman and had her thrashed until she brought forth at the whip ping-post. These are merely examples of thousands of cases which could be proved were an Imperial Commis sion to sit, and could tbe wretched victims of a prolonged oppression recover sufficiently from the dread of their old tyrants to give a truthful report.\" To come to some evidence more recently adduced. On the 9th May 1881, an affidavit was sworn to by tbe Bev. John Thorne, curate of St. John the Evangelist, Lydenburg, Transvaal, and presented to the Boyal Com mission appointed to settle Transvaal affairs, in which be states : \u2014 \" That I was appointed to the charge of a congregation in Botchefstroom, about thirteen years ago, when the Bepublic was under the presidency of Mr. Pretorius.1 I remember noticing one morning, as I walked through the streets, a number of young natives, whom I knew to be strangers. I inquired where they came from. I was told that they had just been brought from Zoutpansberg. This was tbe locality from which slaves were chiefly brought at that time, and were traded for under the name of ' Black Ivory.' One of these natives belonged to Mr. Munich, tbe State Attorney. It was a matter of common remark at that time that the President of tbe Bepublic was himself one of the greatest dealers in slaves.\" In the fourth paragraph of the same affidavit Mr. Tborne says, \" That tbe Bev.

On my expressing surprise, be went on to relate that be had information on native matters which would surprise me more. He then produced tbe copy of a register, kept in tbe Land drost's office, of men, women, and children, to the num ber of four hundred and eighty (480), who had been disposed of by one Boer to another for a consideration. In one case an ox was given in exchange, in another goats, in a third a blanket, and so forth. Many of these natives he (Mr. Nachtigal) knew personally. The copy was certified as true and correct by an official of the Bepublic, and I would mention his name now-, only that I am persuaded that it would cost the man his life if his act became known to the Boers.\" On the 1 6th May 1881, a native, named Frederick Molepo, was examined by the Boyal Commission. The following are extracts from his examination : \u2014 \" (Sir E. Wood) Are you a Christian ? \u2014 Yes. \" (Sir H. de Villiers.) How long were you a slave ? \u2014 Half a year. \"How do you know that you were a slave ?

Transvaal. If they come to tbe conclusion that it did, it must be borne in mind that what existed in tbe past will certainly exist again in the future. Natives are not now any fonder of working for Boers than they were a few years back, and Boers must get labour some how. If, on the other band, it did not exist, then the Boers are a grossly slandered people, and all writers on the subject, from Livingstone down, have combined to take away their character. Leaving native questions for the present, we must now return to tbe general affairs of the country. When President Burgers opened the special sitting of the Volksraad, on the 4th September, he appealed, it will be remembered, to that body for pecuniary aid to liquidate tbe expenses of the war. This appeal was responded to by the passing of a war tax, under which every owner of a farm was to pay ;\u00a3io, the owner of half a farm ,\u00a35, and so on. The tax was not a very just one, since it fell with equal weight on the rich man who held twenty farms and tbe poor man who held but one. Its justice or injustice was, however, to a great extent immaterial, since the free and indepen dent burghers, including some of the members of tbe Volksraad who bad imposed it, promptly refused to pay it, or indeed, whilst they were about it, any other tax. As tbe Treasury was already empty, and creditors were pressing, this refusal was most ill-timed, and things began to look very black indeed. Meanwkilejin addi tion to the ordinary expenditure, and the interest pay able on debts, money had to be found to pay Von Scblickmann's volunteers. As there was no cash in tbe country, this was done by issuing Government promissory notes, known as \" goodfors,\" or vulgarly as"], [217, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 133 \" good for nothings,\" and by promising them all booty, and to each man a farm of two thousand acres, lying east and north-east of tbe Loolu mountains \u2014 in other words, in Secoc\u0153ni's territory, which did not belong to the Government to give away. The officials were the next to suffer, and for six months before the Annexation these unfortunate individuals lived as best they could, for they certainly got no salary, except in the case of a postmaster, who was told to help himself to his pay in stamps. Tbe Government issued large numbers of bills, but the banks refused to discount them, and in some cases the neighbouring colonies had to advance money to the Transvaal* post-cart contractors, who were carry ing tbe mails, as a matter of charity. The Government even mortgaged the great salt-pan near Bretoria for the paltry sum of \u00a3400, whilst the leading officials of the Government were driven to pledging their own private credit in order to obtain the smallest article necessary to its continuance. In fact, to such a pass did things come that when tbe country was annexed a single threepenny bit (which had doubtless been overlooked) was found in the Treasury chest, together with acknow ledgments of debts to tbe extent of nearly \u00a3300,000. Nor was the refusal to pay taxes, which they were powerless to enforce, the only difficulty with which the Government had to contend. Want of money is as bad and painful a thing to a State as to an individual, but there are perhaps worse things than want of money, one of which is to be deserted by your own friends and household. This was the position of the Government of the Bepublic; no sooner was it involved in over whelming difficulties than its own subjects commenced to bait it, more especially the English portion of its"], [218, "THE TRANSVAAL. 134 subjects. They complained to the English authorities about the commandeering of members of their family or goods; they petitioned the British Government to interfere, and generally made themselves as unpleasant as possible to the local authorities. Such a course of action was perhaps natural, but it can hardly be said to be either quite logical or just. The Transvaal Government had never asked them to come and live in the country, and if they did so, it was presumably at their own risk. On the other hand, it must be remembered that many of the agitators had accumu lated property, to leave which would mean ruin; and they saw that, unless something was done, its -value would be destroyed. Under the pressure of all these troubles tbe Boers themselves split up into factions, as they are always ready to do. The Dopper party declared that they had had enough progress, and proposed the extremely conservative Paul Kruger as President, Burgers' time having nearly expired. Paul Kruger accepted the candidature, although he had previously promised his support to Burgers, and distrust of each other was added to the other difficulties of the Executive, the Transvaal becoming a house very much divided against itself. Natives, Doppers, Progressionists, Officials, Eng lish, were all pulling different ways, and each striving for his own advantage. Anything more hopeless than tbe position of tbe country on the 1st January 1877 it is impossible to conceive. Enemies surrounded it ; on every border there was the prospect of a serious war. In the exchequer there was nothing but piles of over due bills. The President was helpless, and mistrustful of his officers, and the officers were caballing against"], [219, "EVENTS PRECEDING THE ANNEXATION. 135 tbe President. All the ordinary functions of Govern ment had ceased, and trade was paralysed. Now and then wild proposals were made to relieve the State of its burdens, some of which partook of the nature of repudiation, but these were the exception ; the majority of the inhabitants, who would neither fight nor pay taxes, sat still and awaited tbe catastrophe, utterly careless of all consequences."], [220, "136 CHAPTEB III. THE ANNEXATION. The state of affairs described in the previous chapter was one that filled the Secretary of State for the Colonies with alarm. During his tenure of office Lord Carnarvon evidently bad the permanent welfare of South Africa much at heart, and he saw with apprehension that the troubles that were brewing in the Transvaal were of a nature likely to involve the Cape and Natal in a native war. Though there is a broad line of demarcation between Dutch and English, it is not so broad but that a victorious nation like the Zulus might cross it, and beginning by fighting tbe Boer, might end by fighting the white man irrespective of race. When tbe reader reflects how terrible would be the consequences of a combination of native tribes against tbe Whites, and how easily such a combination might at that time have been brought about in the first flush of native successes, be will understand the anxiety with which all thinking men watched the course of events in the Transvaal in 1876. At last they took such a serious turn that the Home Government saw that some action must be taken if the catastrophe was to be averted, and determined to despatch Sir Theophilus Shepstone as Special Commis-"], [221, "THE ANNEXATION. 137 sioner to the Transvaal, with powers, should it be neces sary, to annex the country to Her Majesty's dominions, \" in order to secure the peace and safety of Our said colonies and of Our subjects elsewhere.\" The terms of his Commission were unusually large, leaving a great deal to his discretionary power. In choosing that officer for the execution of a most difficult and delicate mission, tbe Government, doubt less, made a very wise selection. Sir Theophilus Shepstone is a man of remarkable tact and ability, combined with great openness and simplicity of mind, and one whose name will always have a leading place in South African history. During a long official life time he has had to do with most of the native races in South Africa, and certainly knows them and their ways better than any living man ; whilst he is by them all regarded with a peculiar and affectionate reverence. He is par excellence their great white chief and \" father,\" and a word from him, even now that he has retired from active life, still carries more weight than the formal remonstrances of any governor in South Africa. With the Boers be is almost equally well ac quainted, having known many of them personally for y-ears. He possesses, moreover, the rare power of winning the regard -and affection, as well as the respect, of those about him in such a marked degree that those who have served him once would go far to serve him again. Sir T. Shepstone, however, has enemies like other people, and is commonly reported among them to be a disciple of Machiavelli, and to have his mind steeped in all the darker wiles of Kafir policy. The Annexation of the Transvaal is by them"], [222, "138 THE TRANSVAAL. attributed to a successful and vigorous use of those arts that distinguished the diplomacy of two centuries ago. Falsehood and bribery are supposed to have been the great levers used to effect the change, together with threats of extinction at the bands of a savage and unfriendly nation. That the Annexation was a triumph of mind over matter is quite true, but whether or no that triumph was unworthily obtained, I will leave those who read this short chronicle of the events connected with it to judge. I saw it somewhat darkly remarked in a newspaper the other day that the history of the Annexation had evidently yet to be written ; and I fear that the remark represents the feeling of most people about that event, implying as it did that it was carried out by means certainly mysteriously and presumably doubtful. I am afraid that those who think thus will be disappointed in what I have to say about the matter, since I know that the means employed to bring the Boers \u2014 \" Fracti bello, fatisque repulsi under Her Majesty's authority were throughout as fair and honest as the Annexation itself was, in my opinion, right and necessary. To return to Sir T. Shepstone. He undoubtedly had faults as a ruler, one of the most prominent of which was that his natural mildness of character would never allow him to act with severity even when severity was necessary. The very criminals condemned to death ran a good chance of reprieve when he had to sign their death-warrants. He has also that worst of faults (so-called), in one fitted by"], [223, "THE ANNEXATION. 139 nature to become great \u2014 want of ambition, a failing that 'in such a man marks him tbe possessor of an even and a philosophic mind. It was no seeking of his own that raised him out of obscurity, and when his work was done to comparative obscurity he elected to return, though whether a man of his ability and experience in South African affairs should, at the present crisis, be allowed to remain there, is another question. On the 20th December 1876, Sir T. Shepstone wrote to Bresident Burgers, informing him of his ap proaching visit to the Transvaal, to secure, if possible, the adjustment of existing troubles, and the adoption of such measures as might be best calculated to pre vent their recurrence in tbe future. On his road to Bretoria, Sir Theophilus received a hearty welcome from tbe Boer as well as the English inhabitants of the country. One of these addresses to him says : \" Be assured, high honourable Sir, that we burghers, now assembled together, entertain the most friendly feeling towards your Government, and that we shall agree with anything you may do in conjunc tion with our Government for the progress of our State, the strengthening against our native enemies, and for the general welfare of all the inhabitants of tbe whole of South Africa. Welcome in Heidelberg, and welcome in the Transvaal.\" At Pretoria the reception of tbe Special Commis sioner was positively enthusiastic ; the whole town came out to meet him, and the horses having been taken out of the carriage, he was dragged in triumph through the streets. In his reply to the address presented to him, Sir Theophilus shadowed forth the"], [224, "THE TRANSVAAL. 140 objects of his mission in these words : \" Becent events in this country have shown to all thinking men the absolute necessity for closer union and more oneness of purpose among the Christian Governments of the southern portion of this continent : the best interests of the native races, no less than the peace and pro sperity of tbe white, imperatively demand it, and I rely upon you and upon your Government to co operate with me in endeavouring to achieve the great and glorious end of inscribing on a general South African banner the appropriate motto \u2014 \" Eendragt maakt magt\" (Unity makes strength). A few days after his arrival a commission was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Henderson and Osborn, on behalf of the Special Commissioner, and Messrs. Kruger and Jorissen, on behalf of the Transvaal Government, to discuss the state of the country. This commission came to nothing, and was on both sides nothing more than a bit of by-play. Tbe arrival of the mission was necessarily regarded with mixed feelings by the inhabitants of the Trans vaal. By one party it was eagerly greeted, viz., tbe English section of the population, who devoutly hoped that it had come to annex the country. With the exception of the Hollander element, the officials also were glad of its arrival, and secretly hoped that the country would be taken over, when there would be more chance of their getting tbeir arrear pay. The better educated Boers also were for tbe most part satisfied that there -was no hope for tbe country unless England helped it in some way, though they did not like having to accept the help. But the more bigoted and narrow-minded among them were undoubtedly"], [225, "THE ANNEXATION. 141 opposed to English interference, and under their leader, Paul Kruger, who was at the time running for the President's chair, did their best to be rid of it. They found ready allies in the Hollander clientelle, with which Mr. Burgers had surrounded himself, headed by the famous Dr. Jorissen, who was, like most of the rulers of this singular State, an ex-clergyman, but now an Attorney-general, not learned in the law. These men were for the most part entirely unfit for the positions they held, and feared that in the event of the country changing hands they might be ejected from them ; and also, they did all Englishmen the favour to regard them with that peculiarly virulent and general hatred which is a part of the secret creed of many foreigners, more especially of such as are under our protection. As may easily be imagined, what between all these different parties and the pre sence of the Special Commissioner, there were certainly plenty of intrigues going on in Pretoria during the first few months of 1877, and the political excitement was very great. Nobody knew how far Sir T. Shepstone was prepared to go, and everybody was afraid of putting out his band further than he could pull it back, and trying to make himself comfortable on two stools at once. Members of the Volksraad and other prominent individuals in the country who had during the day been denouncing tbe Commissioner in no measured terms, and even proposing that he and bis staff should be shot as a warning to the English Government, might be seen arriving at his bouse under cover of the shades of evening, to have a little talk with him, and express the earnest hope that it was his intention to annex the country as soon as"], [226, "THE TRANSVAAL. 142 possible. It is necessary to assist at a peaceable annexation to learn the depth of meanness human nature is capable of. In Pretoria, at any rate, the ladies were of great service to tbe cause of the mission, since they were nearly all in favour of a change of government, and, that being the case, they naturally soon brought their husbands, brothers, and lovers to look at things from tbe same point of view. It was a wise man who said that in any matter where it is necessary to obtain the goodwill of a population you should win over tbe women ; that done, you need not trouble yourself about the men. Though the country was thus overflowing with political intrigues, nothing of the kind went on in the Commissioner's camp. It was not he who made tbe plots to catch the Transvaalers ; on the contrary, they made tbe plots to catch him. For several months all that he did was to sit still and let the rival passions work their way, fighting what the Zulus afterwards called the \" fight of sit down.\" When anybody came to see him he was very glad to meet them, pointed out the desperate condition of the country, and asked them if they could suggest a remedy. And that was about all be did do, beyond informing himself very carefully as to all that was going on in tbe country, aud tbe movements of tbe natives within and outside its borders. There was no money spent in bribery-, as has been stated, though it is impossible to imagine a state of affairs in which it would have been more easy to bribe, or in which it could have been done with greater effect; unless indeed the promise that some pension should be paid to President Burgers can"], [227, "THE ANNEXATION. 143 be called a bribe, which it was certainly never intended to be, but simply a guarantee that after having spent all his private means on behalf of the State he should not be left destitute. The statement that tbe Annexa tion was effected under a threat that if the Government did not give its consent Sir T. Shepstone would let loose the Zulus on the country is also a wicked and malicious invention, but with this I shall deal more at length further on. It must not, however, be understood that tbe An nexation was a foregone conclusion, or that Sir T. Shepstone came up to the Transvaal with the fixed intention of annexing the country without reference to its position, merely with a view of extending British influence, or, as has been absurdly stated, in order to benefit Natal. He bad no fixed purpose, whether it were necessary or no, of exercising the full powers given to him by his commission ; on the contrary, he was all along most anxious to find some internal resources within the State by means of which Annexa tion could be averted, and of this fact bis various letters and despatches give full proof. Thus, in his letter to President Burgers, of the 9th April 1877, in which he announces his intention of annexing tbe country, be says : \" I have more than once assured your Honour that if I could think of any plan by which the independence of the State could be main tained by its own internal resources I would most certainly not conceal that plan from you.\" It is also incidentally remarkably confirmed by a passage in Mr. Burgers' posthumous defence, in which be says : \"Hence I met Shepstone alone in my bouse, and opened up the subject of bis mission. With a candour"], [228, "THE TRANSVAAL. 144 that astonished me, be avowed that his purpose was to annex tbe country, as he bad sufficient grounds for it, unless I could so alter as to satisfy his Government. My plan of a new constitution, modelled after that of America, of a standing police force of two hundred mounted men, was then proposed. He promised to give me time to call tbe Volksraad together, and to abandon his design if the Volksraad would adopt these measures, and the country be willing to submit to them, and to carry them out.\" Further on he says : \" In justice to Shepstone I must say that I would not consider an officer of my Government to have acted faithfully if he had not done what Shepstone did.\" It has also been frequently alleged in England, and always seems to be taken as tbe groundwork of argu ment in tbe matter of the Annexation, that the Special Commissioner represented that the majority of tbe inhabitants wished for the Annexation, and that it was sanctioned on that ground. This statement shows the great ignorance that exists in this country of South African affairs, an ignorance which in this case has been carefully fostered by Mr. Gladstone's Government for party purposes, they having found it necessary to assume, in order to make their position in the matter tenable, that Sir T. Shepstone and other officers bad been guilty of misrepresentation. Un fortunately, the Government and its supporters have been more intent upon making out their case than upon ascertaining the truth of their statements. If they had taken the trouble to refer to Sir T. Shep stone's despatches, they would have found that the ground on which the Transvaal was annexed was, not because the majority of the inhabitants wished for it,"], [229, "THE ANNEXATION. 145 but because the State was drifting into anarchy, was bankrupt, and was about to be destroyed by native tribes. They would further have found that Sir T. Shepstone never represented that the majority of the Boers were in favour of Annexation. What he did say was that most thinking men in the country saw no other way out of the difficulty ; but what pro portion of the Boers can be called \" thinking men ? \" He also said, in the fifteenth paragraph of his des patch to Lord Carnarvon of 6th March 1877, that petitions signed by 2500 people, representing every class of tbe community, out of a total adult male population of 8000, had been presented to the Govern ment of the Bepublic, setting forth its difficulties and dangers, and praying it \" to treat with me for their amelioration or removal.\" He also stated, and with perfect truth, that many more would have signed bad it not been for tbe terrorism that was exercised, and that all the towns and villages in the country desired the change, which was a patent fact. This is the foundation on which the charge of misrepresentation is built \u2014 a charge which has been manipulated so skilfully, and with such a charming disregard for the truth, that the British public has been duped into believing it. When it is examined into, it vanishes into thin air. But a darker charge has been brought against tbe Special Commissioner \u2014 a charge affecting his honour as a gentleman and bis character as a Christian ; and, strange to say, has gained a considerable credence, especially amongst a certain party in England. I allude to the statement that he called up the Zulu army with the intention of sweeping tbe Transvaal K"], [230, "146 THE TRANSVAAL. if the Annexation was objected to. I may state, from my own personal knowledge, that tbe report is a complete falsehood, and that no such threat was ever made, either by Sir T. Shepstone or by anybody connected with him, and I will briefly prove what I say. When tbe mission first arrived at Pretoria, a message came from Cetyway-o to the effect that he had beard that tbe Boers had fired at \" Sompseu \" (Sir T. Shepstone), and announcing bis intention of attacking the Transvaal if \" his father \" was touched. About the middle of March alarming rumours began to spread as to the intended action of Cetywayo with reference to the Transvaal ; but as Sir T. Shepstone did not think that the king would be likely to make any hostile movement whilst be w-as in tbe country, he took no steps in the matter .\u00bb Neither did the Transvaal Government ask bis advice and assistance. Indeed, a remarkable trait in the Boers is their supreme self-conceit, which makes them believe that they are capable of subduing all tbe natives in Africa, and of thrashing tbe whole British army if necessary. Unfortunately, tbe recent course of events has tended to confirm them in tbeir opinion as regards tbeir white enemies. To return : towards tbe second week in April, or tbe week before tbe proclamation of Annexation was issued, things began to look very serious ; indeed, rumours that could hardly be dis credited reached the Special Commissioner that the whole Zulu army was collected in a chain of Impis or battalions, with tbe intention of bursting into the Transvaal and sweeping the country. Knowing bow terrible would be tbe catastrophe if this were to"], [231, "THE ANNEXATION. 147 happen, Sir T. Shepstone was much alarmed about the matter, and at a meeting with tbe Executive Council of the Transvaal Government he pointed out to them the great danger in which tbe country was placed. This was done in tbe presence of several officers of his staff, and it was -on this friendly exposi tion of tbe state of affairs that the charge that he had threatened the country with invasion by the Zulus was based. On the 1 1 tb April, or tbe day before tbe Annexation, a message was despatched to Cetywayo, telling him of the reports that had reached Pretoria, and stating that if they were true he must forthwith give up all such intentions, as the Transvaal would at once be placed under tbe sovereignty of Her Majesty, and that if he bad assembled any armies for purposes of aggression they must be disbanded at once. Sir T. Shepstone's message reached Zululand not a day too soon. Had the Annexation of the Transvaal been delayed by a few weeks even \u2014 and this is a point which I earnestly beg Englishmen to remember in con nection with that act \u2014 Cetywayo's armies would have entered tbe Transvaal, carrying death before them, and leaving a wilderness behind them. Cetywayo's answer to the Special Commissioner's message will sufficiently show, to use Sir Theophilus' own words in bis despatch on the subject, \"the pin nacle of peril which tbe Bepublic and South Africa generally had reached at the moment when the Annexation took place.\" He says, \" I thank my Father Sompseu (Sir T. Shepstone) for bis message. I am glad that he has sent it, because the Dutch have tired me out, and I intended to fight them once and once only, and to drive them over the Vaal. Kabana"], [232, "THE TRANSVAAL. 148 (name of messenger), you see my Impis (armies) are gathered. It was to fight tbe Dutch I called them together : now I will send them back to their homes. Is it well that two men (' amadoda-amabili ') should be made ' iziula ' (fools) ? In the reign of my father Umpanda tbe Boers were constantly moving their boundary further into my country. Since his death the same thing has been done. I had therefore deter mined to end it once for all ! \" The message then goes on to other matters, and ends with a request to be allowed to sight tbe Amaswazi, because \" they fight together and kill one another. This,\" says Cety wayo naively, \" is wrong, and I want to chastise them for it.\" This quotation will suffice to convince all reason able men, putting aside all other matters, from what imminent danger the Transvaal was delivered by the much-abused Annexation. Some months after that event, however, it occurred to the ingenious mind of some malicious individual in Natal that, properly used, much political capital might be made out of this Zulu incident, and the story that Cetywayo's army bad been called up by Sir Theophilus himself to overawe, and, if necessary, subdue tbe Transvaal, was accordingly invented and industriously circulated. Although Sir T. Shepstone at once caused it to be authoritatively contradicted, such an astonish ing slander naturally took firm root, and on tbe 1 2th April 1879 we have Mr. M. W. Pretorius, one of the Boer leaders, publicly stating at a meeting of the farmers that \" previous to tbe Annexation Sir T. Shepstone had threatened the Transvaal with an attack from tbe Zulus as an argument for advancing tbe"], [233, "THE ANNEXATION. 149 Annexation.\" Under such an imputation the Govern ment could no longer keep silence, and accordingly Sir Owen Lanyon, who was then Administrator of the Transvaal, caused the matter to be officially investi gated, with these results, which are summed up by him in a letter to Mr. Pretorius, dated 1st May 1879:\u2014 1 . Tbe records of tbe Bepublican Executive Council contained no allusion to any such statement. 2. Two members of that Council filed statements in which they unreservedly denied that Sir T. Shepstone used the words or threats imputed to him. 3. Two officers of Sir T. Shepstone's staff, who were always present with him at interviews with the Exe cutive Council, filed statements to the same effect. \" I have no doubt,\" adds Sir Owen Lanyon, \" that tbe report has been originated and circulated by some evil-disposed person.\" In addition to this evidence we have a letter written to the Colonial Office by Sir T. Shepstone, dated Lon don, August 12, 1879, in which he points out that Mr. Pretorius was not even present at any of the interviews with the Executive Council on which occa sion he accuses him of having made use of the threats. He further shows that the use of such a threat on his part would have been the depth of folly, and \" know ingly to court the instant and ignominious failure of my mission,\" because tbe Boers were so persuaded of their own prowess that they could not be convinced that they stood in any danger from native sources, and also because \" such play with sucb keen-edged tools as the excited passions of savages are, and especially such savages as I knew the Zulus to be, is not what"], [234, "THE TRANSVAAL. 150 an experience of forty-two years in managing them inclined me to.\" And yet, in the face of all this accu mulated evidence, this report continues to be believed, that is, by those who wished to believe it. Such are the accusations that have been brought against tbe manner of tbe Annexation and the officer who carried it out, and never were accusations more groundless. Indeed, both for party purposes, and from personal animus, every means, fair or foul, has been used to discredit it and all connected with it. To take a single instance, one author (Miss Colenso, p. 134, \" History of the Zulu War \") actually goes the length of putting a portion of a speech made by Bresident Burgers into tbe mouth of Sir T. Shepstone, and then abusing him for his incredible profanity. Surely this exceeds the limits of fair criticism. Before I go on to tbe actual history of the Annexa tion there is one point I wish to submit to my reader. In England the change of Government has always been talked of as though it only affected the forty thousand white inhabitants of the country, whilst everybody seems to forget that this same land had about a million human beings living on it, its original owners, and only, unfortunately for themselves, pos sessing a black skin, and therefore entitled to little consideration, \u2014 even at the bands of tbe most philan thropic Government in the world. It never seems to have occurred to those who have raised so much out cry on behalf of the forty thousand Boers, to inquire what was thought of the matter by the million natives. If they were to be allowed a voice in their own dis posal, the country was certainly annexed by the wish of a very large majority of the inhabitants. It is true"], [235, "THE ANNEXATION. 151 that Secoc\u0153ni, instigated thereto by the Boers, after wards continued the war against us, but, with the exception of this one chief, the advent of our rule was hailed with joy by every native in the Transvaal, and even he was glad of it at tbe time. During our period of rule in the Transvaal the natives have had, as they foresaw, more peace than at any time since the white man set foot in the land. They have paid their taxes gladly, and there has been no fighting among them selves ; but since we have given up the country we hear a very different tale. It is this million of men, women, and children who, notwithstanding their black skins, live and feel, and have intelligence as much as ourselves, who are the principal, because the most numerous sufferers from Mr. Gladstone's conjuring tricks, that can turn a Sovereign into a Suzerain as airily as the professor of magic brings a litter of guinea-pigs out of a top hat. It is our falsehood and treachery to them whom we took over \" for ever,\" as we told them, and whom we have now handed back to their natural enemies to be paid off for their loyalty to tbe Englishman, that is tbe blackest stain in all this black business, and that has destroyed our prestige, and caused us to be looked on amongst them, for they do not hide their opinion, as \" cowards and liars.\" But very little attention, however, seems to have been paid to native views or claims at any time in the Transvaal ; indeed they have all along been treated as serfs of the soil, to be sold with it, if necessary, to a new master. It is true that the Government, acting under pressure from the Aborigines Brotection Society, made, on tbe occasion of the Surrender, a feeble effort to secure the independence of some of the native"], [236, "THE TRANSVAAL. 152 tribes; but when the Boer leaders told them sbortly tbat they would have nothing of the sort, and that, if they were not careful, they would reoccupy Laing's Nek, tbe proposal was at once dropped, with many assurances that no offence was intended. The worst of the matter is that this treatment of our native subjects and allies will assuredly recoil on the beads of future innocent Governments. Shortly after the appointment of the Joint-Com mission alluded to at the beginning of this chapter, Bresident Burgers, who was now in possession of the Special Commissioner's intentions, should be be unable to carry out reforms sufficiently drastic to satisfy the English Government, thought it best to call together the Volksraad. In tbe meantime, it bad been an nounced that tbe \" rebel \" Secoc\u0153ni had sued for peace and signed a treaty declaring himself a subject of the Bepublic. I shall have to enter into the question of this treaty a little further on, so I will at present only say that it was the first business laid before the Baad, and, after some discussion, ratified. Next in order to the Secoc\u0153ni peace came the question of Confederation, as laid down in Lord Carnarvon's Ber missive Bill. This proposal was laid before them in an earnest and eloquent speech by tbeir Bresident, who entreated them to consider the dangerous position of the Bepublic, and to face their difficulties like men. The question was referred to a committee, and an adverse report being brought up, was rejected without further consideration. It is just possible that intimi dation had something to do with the summary treat ment of so important a matter, seeing that whilst it was being argued a large mob of Boers, looking very"], [237, "THE ANNEXATION. 153 formidable with their sea-cow hide whips, watched every move of their representatives through the windows of the Volksraad Hall. It was Mr. Chamberlain's caucus system in practical and visible operation. A few day-s after the rejection of tbe Confederation Bill, Bresident Burgers, who had frequently alluded to tbe desperate condition of the Bepublic, and stated that either some radical reform must be effected or tbe country must come under the British flag, laid before the Baad a bran new constitution of a very remarkable nature, asserting that they must either accept it or lose their independence. The first part of this strange document dealt with the people and their rights, which remained much as they were before, with the exception that the secrecy of all letters entrusted to the post was to be inviolable. The recognition of this right is an amusing incident in the history of a free Bepublic. Under following articles the Volksraad was entrusted with the charge of the native inhabitants of the State, tbe provision for the administration of justice, the conduct of education, the regulation of money-bills, &c. It is in the fourth chapter, however, that we come to tbe real gist of tbe Bill, which was the endowment of the State President with the authority of a dictator. Mr. Burgers thought to save the State by making himself an absolute monarch. He was to be elected for a period of seven instead of five years, and to be eligible for re-election. In him was vested the power of making all appointments without reference to the Legislature. All laws were to be drawn up by him, and he was to have the right of veto on Volksraad resolutions, which body he could summon and dissolve"], [238, "THE TRANSVAAL. 154 at will. Finally, bis Executive Council was to consist of heads of departments appointed by himself, and of one member of tbe Volksraad. The Volksraad treated this Bill in much tbe same way as they had dealt with the Bermissive Confederation Bill, gave it a casual consideration, and threw it out. The President, meanwhile, was doing his best to convince the Baad of the danger of the country ; that the treasury was empty, whilst duns were pressing, that enemies were threatening on every side, and, finally-, that Her Majesty's Special Commissioner was encamped witbin a thousand yards of them, watching their deliberations with some interest. He showed them that it was impossible at once to scorn reform and reject friendly offers, that it was doubtful if anything could save them, but that if they took no steps they were certainly lost as a nation. The \"Fathers of tbe land,\" however, declined to dance to the Bresident's piping. Then he took a bolder line. He told them that a guilty nation never can evade the judgment that follows its steps. He asked them \" conscientiously to advise the people not obstinately to refuse a union with a powerful Government. He could not advise them to refuse such a union. . . . He did not believe that a new constitution would save them ; for as little as the old constitution had brought them to ruin, so little would a new constitution bring salvation. . . . If tbe citizens of England had behaved towards the Crown as the burghers of this State bad behaved to their Government, England would never have stood so long as she had.\" He pointed out to them their hopeless financial position. \" To-day,\" he said, \" a bill for ;\u00a3iioo was laid before me for signature; but I"], [239, "THE ANNEXATION. 155 would sooner have cut off my right band than sign that paper \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 for I have not the slightest ground to expect that, when that bill becomes due, there will be a penny to pay it with.\" And finally-, be exhorted them thus : \" Let them make the best of tbe situation, and get the best terms they possibly could ; let them agree to join their hands to those of their brethren in tbe south, and then from the Cape to the Zambesi there would be one great people. Yes, there was something grand in that, grander even than tbeir idea of a Bepublic, something which minis tered to their national feeling \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 and would this be so miserable ? Yes, this would be miserable for those who would not be under the law, for the rebel and the revolutionist, but welfare and prosperity for the men of law and order.\" These powerful words form a strong indictment against the Bepublic, and from them there can be little doubt that President Burgers was thoroughly convinced of tbe necessity and wisdom of tbe Annexation. It is interesting to compare them, and many other utter ances of his made at this period, with tbe opinions he expresses in tbe posthumous document recently pub lished, in which be speaks somewhat jubilantly of tbe lessons taught us on Laing's Nek and Majuba by such \" an inherently weak people as the Boers,\" and points to them as striking instances of retribution. In this document he attributes the Annexation to the desire to advance English supremacy in South Africa, and to lay hold of the way to Central South Africa. It is, however, noticeable that he does not in any way indi cate how it could have been averted, and the State continue to exist ; and be seems all along to feel that"], [240, "THE TRANSVAAL. 1 56 his case is a weak one, for in explaining, or attempting to explain, why he had never defended himself from the charges brought against him in connection with the Annexation, be says : \" Had I not endured in silence, bad I not borne patiently all the accusations, but out of selfishness or fear told tbe plain truth of tbe case, tbe Transvaal would never have had the con sideration it has now received from Great Britain. How ever unjust the Annexation was, my self-justification would have exposed the Boers to such an extent, and the state of the country in such a way, that it would have deprived them both of the sympathy of the world and the consideration of the English politicians.\" In other words, \" If I had told the truth about things as I should have been obliged to do to justify myself, there would have been no more outcry about tbe Annexa tion, because the whole world, even the English Badicals, would have recognised how necessary it was, and what a fearful state the country was in.\" But to let that pass, it is evident that President Burgers did not take tbe same view of the Annexation in 1877 as he did in 1881, and indeed bis speeches to tbe Volksraad would read rather oddly printed in parallel columns with his posthumous statement. Tbe reader would be forced to one of two conclusions, either on one of tbe two occasions he is saying what be does not mean, or be must have changed his mind. As I believe him to have been an honest man, I incline to tbe latter supposition ; nor do I consider it so very hard to account for, taking into consideration his natural Dutch proclivities. In 1877 Burgers is the despairing head of a State driving rapidly to ruin, if not to actual extinction, when the strong hand of"], [241, "THE ANNEXATION. 157 tbe English Government is held out to him. What wonder that be accepts it gladly on behalf of bis country, which is by its help brought into a state of greater prosperity than it has ever before known ? In 1 88 1 tbe wheel has gone round, and great events have come about whilst be lies dying. The enemies of the Boers have been destroyed, the powers of the Zulus and Secoc\u0153ni are no more ; tbe country has prospered under a healthy rule, and its finances have been restored. More, \u2014 glad tidings have come from Mid-Lothian to the \" rebel and the revolutionist,\" whose hopes were flagging, and eloquent words have been spoken by tbe new English Dictator that have aroused a great rebellion. And, to crown all, EngUsh troops have suffered one massacre and three defeats, and England sues for peace from the South African peasant, heedless of honour or her broken word, so that the prayer be granted. With such events before him, that dying man may well have found cause to change his opinion. Doubtless the Annexation was wrong, since England disowns her acts ; and may not that dream about the great South African Bepublic come true after all ? Has not tbe pre-eminence of the Englishman received a blow from which it can never recover, and is not his control over Boers and natives irredeemably weakened ? And must he, \u2014 Burgers, \u2014 go down to posterity as a Dutchman who tried to for ward the interests of the English party ? No, doubt less the Annexation was wrong ; but it has done good, for it has brought about the downfall of the English : and we will end the argument in the very words of his last public utterance, with which be ends bis statement : \" South Africa gained more from this, and"], [242, "158 THE TRANSVAAL. has made a larger step forward in the march of freedom, than most people can conceive.\" Who shall say that he is wrong ? the words of dying men are sometimes prophetic ! South Africa has made a great advance towards tbe \" freedom \" of a Dutch Bepublic. This has been a digression, but I hope not an un interesting one. To return \u2014 on the 1st March, Sir T. Shepstone met the Executive Council, and told them that in his opinion there was now but one remedy to be adopted, and that was that the Trans vaal should be united with tbe English colonies of South Africa under one head, namely the Queen, say ing at tbe same time that the only thing now left to the Bepublic was to make tbe best arrangements it could for the future benefit of its inhabitants, and to submit to that which he saw to be, and every thinking man saw to be, inevitable. So soon as this information was officially communicated to the Baad, for a good proportion of its members were already acquainted with it unofficially, it flew from a state of listless indifference into vigorous and hasty action. Tbe Bresident was censured, and a committee was appointed to consider and report upon the situation, wdiicb reported in favour of the adoption of Burgers' new constitution. Accord ingly, the greatest part of this measure, which had been contemptuously rejected a few days before, was adopted almost without question, and Mr. Paul Kruger was appointed Vice-President. On the following day, a very drastic treason law was passed, borrowed from the statute-book of the Orange Free State, which made all public expression of opinion, if adverse to the Government, or in any way supporting the Annexa-"], [243, "THE ANNEXATION. 159 tion party, high treason. This done, the Assembly prorogued itself until \u2014 October 1 8 8 1 . During and after the sitting of the Baad, rumours arose that the chief Secoc\u0153ni's signature to the treaty of peace, ratified by that body, bad been obtained by misrepresentation. As ratified, this treaty consisted of three articles, according to which Secoc\u0153ni con sented, first, to become a subject of the Bepublic, and obey the laws of the country; secondly, to agree to a certain restricted boundary line ; and, thirdly, to pay 2000 bead of cattle; which, considering he had cap tured quite 5000 bead, was not exorbitant. Towards the end of February a written message was received from Secoc\u0153ni by Sir T. Shepstone, dated after the signing of the supposed treaty. The original, which was written in Sisutu, was a great curiosity. The following is a correct translation : \u2014 February 16, 1 87 7. \" For Myn Heer Sheepstone, \u2014 I beg you, Chief, come help me, the Boers are killing me, and I don't know the reasons why they should be angry with me ; Chief, I beg you come with Myn Heer Merensky. \u2014 I am Sikukuni.\" This message was accompanied by a letter from Mr. Merensky, a well-known and successful mis sionary, who had been for many years resident in Secoc\u0153ni's country, in which he stated that he beard on very good authority that Secoc\u0153ni had distinctly refused to agree to that article of the treaty by which he became a subject of the State. He adds that he cannot remain \" silent while such tricks are played.\""], [244, "160 THE TRANSVAAL. Upon this information, Sir T. Shepstone wrote to Bresident Burgers, stating that \" if the officer in whom you have placed confidence has withheld any portion of tbe truth from you, especially so serious a portion of it, be is guilty of a wrong towards you personally, as well as towards the Government, because be has caused you to assume an untenable position,\" and suggesting that a joint-commission should be despatched to Secoc\u0153ni, to thoroughly sift the question in tbe interest of all concerned. This suggestion was after some delay agreed to, and a commission was appointed, consisting of Mr. Van Gorkom, a Hollander, and Mr. Holtshausen, a member of the Executive Council, on behalf of tbe Transvaal Government, and Mr. Osborn, B.M., and Captain Clarke, B.A.,1 on behalf of the Commissioner, whom I accompanied as Secretary. At Middleburg the native Gideon who acted as interpreter between Commandant Ferreira, C.M.G. (the officer who negotiated tbe treaty on behalf of the Boer Government), and Secoc\u0153ni was examined, and also two natives, Petros and Jeremiah, who were with him, but did not actually interpret. All these men persisted that Secoc\u0153ni had positively refused to be come a subject of the Bepublic,\" and only consented to sign tbe treaty on the representations of Commandant Ferreira that it would only be binding as regards to the two articles about the cattle and tbe boundary line. The Commission then proceeded to Secoc\u0153ni's town, accompanied by a fresh set of interpreters, and bad a long interview with Secoc\u0153ni. Tbe chief's Prime Minister or \" mouth,\" Makurupiji, speaking in bis 1 Now Sir Marshall Clarke, Special Commissioner for Basutoland."], [245, "THE ANNEXATION. 161 presence and on his behalf, and making use of the pronoun \" I \" before all the assembled headmen of the tribe, gave an account of the interview between Com mandant Ferreira in the presence of that gentleman, who accompanied the Commission, and Secoc\u0153ni, in almost the same words as had been used by the in terpreters at Middleburg. He distinctly denied having consented to become a subject of the Bepublic or to stand under the law, and added that he feared' he \" had touched the feather to \" (signed) things that he did not know of in the treaty. Commandant Ferreira then put some questions, but entirely failed to shake the evidence ; on the contrary, he admitted by his questions that Secoc\u0153ni had not consented to become a subject of the Bepublic. Secoc\u0153ni had evidently signed the piece of paper under the impression that he was acknowledging his liability to pay 2000 head of cattle, and fixing a certain portion of his boundary line, and on the distinct understanding that he was not to become a subject of the State. Now it was the Secoc\u0153ni war that had brought the English Mission into the country, and if it could be shown that the Secoc\u0153ni war had come to a successful termination, it would go far towards help ing the Mission out again. To this end, it was necessary that the chief should declare himself a subject of tbe State, and thereby, by implication, acknowledge himself to have been a rebel, and admit his defeat. All that was required was a signature, and that once obtained the treaty was published and submitted to the Baad for confirmation, without a whisper being heard of the conditions under which this ignorant Basuto was induced to sign. Had no L"], [246, "THE TRANSVAAL. 1 62 Commission visited Secoc\u0153ni, this treaty would after wards have been produced against him in its entirety. Altogether, tbe history of tbe Secoc\u0153ni Peace Treaty does not reassure one as to tbe genuineness of the treaties which the Boers are continually producing, purporting to have been signed by native chiefs, and, as a general rule, presenting the State with great tracts of country in exchange for a horse or a few oxen. However fond tbe natives may be of their Boer neighbours, such liberality can scarcely be genuine. On the other hand, it is so easy to induce a savage to sign a paper, or even, if he is reticent, to make a cross for him, and once made, as we all know, litera scripta manet, and becomes title to the lands. During the Secoc\u0153ni investigation, affairs in the Transvaal were steadily drifting towards anarchy. The air was filled with rumours ; now it was reported that an outbreak was imminent amongst the English population at the Gold Fields, who bad never forgotten Von Schlickmann's kind suggestion that they should be \" subdued ; \" now it was said that Cetywayo bad crossed the border, and might shortly be expected at Pretoria : now that a large body of Boers were on their road to shoot the Special Commissioner, bis twenty-five policemen, and Englishmen generally, and so on. Meanwhile, Paul Kruger and bis party were not letting the grass grow under their feet, but worked public feeling with great vigour, with the double object of getting Paul made President and ridding themselves of the English. Articles in his support were printed in the well-known Dutch paper Die Patriot, published in the Cape Colony, which are so typical of the Boers and of tbe only literature that"], [247, "THE ANNEXATION. 163 has the slightest influence over them, that I will quote a few extracts from one of them. After drawing a very vivid picture of the wretched condition of tbe country as* compared to what it was when the Kafirs had \" a proper respect \" for the Boers, before Burgers came into power, tbe article proceeds to give the cause of this state of affairs. \" God's word,\" it says, \" gives us the solution. Look at Israel, while tbe people have a godly king, every thing is prosperous, but under a godless prince the land retrogrades, and tbe whole of the people must suffer. Bead Leviticus, chapter xxvi., with attention, &c. In the day of the Voortrekkers (pioneers), a handful of men chased a thousand Kafirs and made them run ; so also in tbe Free State war (Deut. xxxii. 30; Jos. xxiii. 10 ; Lev. xxvi. 8). But mark, now, when Burgers became Bresident, he knows no Sabbath, be rides through the land in and out of town on Sunday, he knows not the church and God's service (Lev. xxvi. 2, 3), to the scandal of pious people. And be formerly was a priest too. And what is the consequence ? No harvest (Lev. xxvi. 16), an army of 6000 men runs because one man falls (Lev. xxvi. 1 7, &c). What is now the remedy ? \" Tbe remedy proves to be Paul Kruger, \" because there is no other candidate. Because our Lord clearly points him out to be the man, for why is there no other candidate ? Who arranged it this way ? \" Then follows a rather odd argument in favour of Paul's election. \" Because he himself (Baul Kruger) acknow ledges in bis own reply that he is incompetent, but that all his ability is from our Lord. Because he is a warrior. Because he is a Boer.\" Then Baul"], [248, "164 THE TRANSVAAL. Kruger, the warrior and the Boer, is compared to Joan of Arc, \"a simple Boer girl who came from behind the sheep.\" The burghers of the Transvaal are exhorted to acknowledge tbe hand of the Lord, and elect Baul Kruger, or to look for still heavier punishment. (Lev. xxvi. 1 8 et seq.) Next tbe Patriot proceeds to give a bit of advice to \" our candidate, Paul Kruger.\" He is to deliver the land from the Kafirs. \"The Lord has given you tbe heart of a warrior, arise and drive them,\" a bit of advice quite suited to his well-known character. But this chosen vessel was not to get all the loaves and fishes ; on the contrary, as soon as he had fulfilled bis mission of \" driving \" the Kafirs, he was to band over his office to a \"good\" Bresident. Tbe article ends thus : \" If tbe Lord wills to use you now to deliver this land from its enemies, and a day of peace and prosperity arises again, and you see that you are not exactly the statesman to further govern the Bepublic, then it will be your greatest honour to say, ' Citizens, I have delivered you from the enemy, I am no states man, but now you have peace and time to choose and elect a good Bresident.' \" An article such as the above is instructive reading, as showing the low calibre of the minds that are influenced by it. Yet such writings and sermons have more power among tbe Boers than any other arguments, appealing as they do to the fanaticism and vanity of their nature, which causes them to believe that the Divinity is continually interfering on tbeir behalf at the cost of other people. It will be noticed that the references given are all to the Old Testament, and nearly all refer to acts of blood."], [249, "THE ANNEXATION. 165 These doctrines were not, however, at all acceptable to Burgers' party, or tbe more enlightened members of the community, and so bitter did the struggle of rival opinions become that there is very little doubt that had the country not been annexed, civil war would have been added to its other calamities. Mean while tbe natives were from day to day becoming more restless, and messengers were constantly arriving at the Special Commissioner's camp, begging that their tribe might be put under the Queen, and stating that they would fight rather than submit any longer to the Boers. At length on the 9th April, Sir T. Shepstone in formed the Government of the Bepublic that he was about to declare the Transvaal British territory. He told them that he had considered and reconsidered his determination, but that be could see no possible means within the State by which it could free itself from the burdens that were sinking it to destruction, adding that if he could have found such means he would certainly not have hidden them from the Government. This intimation was received in silence, though all the later proceedings with reference to the Annexation were in reality carried out in concert with the authorities of the Bepublic. Thus on the 13 th March the Government submitted a paper of ten questions to Sir T. Shepstone as regards the future condition of the Transvaal under English rule, whether the debts of the State would be guaranteed, &c. To these questions replies were given which were on tbe whole satisfactory to the Government. As these re plies formed the basis of tbe proclamation guarantees, it is not necessary to enter into them."], [250, "1 66 THE TRANSVAAL. It was further arranged by the Bepublican Govern ment that a formal protest should be entered against the Annexation, which was accordingly prepared and privately shown to the Special Commissioner. The Annexation proclamation was also shown to Bresident Burgers, and a paragraph eliminated at bis sugges tion. In fact, tbe Special Commissioner and tbe President, together with most of bis Executive, were quite at one as regards the necessity of the proclama tion being issued, their joint endeavours being directed to the prevention of any disturbance, and to secure a good reception for the change. At length, after three months of inquiry and nego tiation, tbe proclamation of annexation was on the 1 2th of April 1877 read by Mr. Osborn, accompanied by some other gentlemen of Sir T. Shepstone's staff. It was an anxious moment for all concerned. To use the words of tbe Special Commissioner in bis despatch borne on the subject, \"Every effort had been made during the previous fortnight by, it is said, educated Hollanders, and who bad but lately arrived in the country, to rouse the fanaticism of the Boers, and to induce them to offer ' bloody ' resistance to what it was known I intended to do. The Boers were appealed to in the most inflammatory language by printed manifestoes and memorials ; .... it was urged that I had but a small escort, which could easily be overpowered.\" In a country so full of desperadoes and fanatical haters of anything English, it was more than possible that, though such an act would have been condemned by the general sense of the country, a number of men could easily be found who would think they were doing a righteous act in"], [251, "THE ANNEXATION. 167 greeting the \" annexationists \" with an ovation of bullets. I do not mean that the anxiety was personal, because I do not think the members of that small party set any higher value on their lives than other people, but it was absolutely necessary for the success of tbe act itself, and for the safety of the country, that not a single shot should be fired. Had that happened it is probable that the whole country would have been involved in confusion and bloodshed, tbe Zulus would have broken in, and the Kafirs would have risen ; in fact, to use Cetywayo's words, \" the land would have burned with fire.\" It will therefore be easily understood what an anxious hour that was both for the Special Commis sioner sitting up at Government House, and for his staff down on the Market Square, and how thankful they were when the proclamation was received with hearty cheers by the crowd. Mr. Burgers' protest, which was read immediately afterwards, was received in respectful silence. And thus tbe Transvaal Territory passed for a while into the great family of the English Colonies. I believe that the greatest political opponent of the act will bear tribute to the very remarkable ability with which it was carried out. When tbe variety and number of the various interests that had to be conciliated, tbe obstinate nature of the individuals who had to be convinced, as well as the innate hatred of the English name and ways which had to be overcome to carry out this act successfully, are taken into con sideration, together with a thousand other matters, the neglect of any one of which would have sufficed to make failure certain, it will be seen what tact and"], [252, "168 THE TRANSVAAL. skill and knowledge of human nature were required to execute so difficult a task. It must be remem bered that no force was used, and that there never was any threat of force. The few troops that were to enter the Transvaal were four weeks' march from Pretoria at the time. There was nothing whatso ever to prevent the Boers putting a summary stop to the proceedings of the Commissioner if they had thought fit*. That Sir Theophilus played a bold and hazardous game nobody will deny, but, like most players who combine boldness with coolness of head and justice of cause, he won ; and, without shedding a single drop of blood, or even confiscating an acre of land, and at no cost, annexed a great country, and averted a very serious war. That same country four years later cost us a million of money, the loss of nearly a thousand men killed and wounded, and the ruin of many more confiding thousands, to surrender. It is true, however, that nobody can accuse tbe retrocession of having been conducted with judgment or ability \u2014 very much the contrary. There can be no more ample justification of the issue of tbe Annexation proclamation than the pro clamation itself. First, it touches on tbe Sand Biver Convention of 1852, by which independence was granted to tbe State, and shows that the \" evident objects and in citing motives \" in granting such guarantee were to promote peace, free-trade, and friendly intercourse, in tbe hope and belief that the Bepublic \" would become a flourishing and self-sustaining State, a source of strength and security to neighbouring European com-"], [253, "THE ANNEXATION. 169 munities, and a point from which Christianity and civilisation might rapidly spread toward Central Africa.\" It goes on to show how these hopes have been disappointed, and how that \" increasing weakness in the State itself on the one side, and more than corresponding growth of real strength and confidence among the native tribes on the other, have produced their natural and inevitable consequence . . . that after more or less of irritating conflict with aboriginal tribes to the north, there commenced about the year 1867 giadual abandonment to the natives in that direction of territory settled by burghers of the Trans vaal \" in well-built towns and villages and on granted farms.\" It goes on to show that \" this decay of power and ebb of authority in the north is being followed by similar processes in the south under yet more dan- gerous circumstances. People of this State residing in that direction have been compelled within the last three months, at the bidding of native chiefs, and at a moment's notice, to leave their farms and homes, their standing crops ... all to be taken possession of by natives, but that the Government is more powerless than ever to vindicate its assumed rights or to resist the declension that is threatening its existence.\" It then recites how all the other colonies and communi- ties of South Africa have lost confidence in tbe State, bow it is in a condition of hopeless bankruptcy, and its commerce annihilated, whilst the inhabitants are divided into factions, and the Government has fallen into \"helpless paralysis.\" How also tbe prospect of tbe election of a new President, instead of being looked forward to with hope, would in the opinion of"], [254, "THE TRANSVAAL. 170 all parties be the signal for civil war, anarchy, and bloodshed. How that this state of things affords the very strongest temptation to the great neighbouring native powers to attack the country, a temptation that they were only too ready and anxious to yield to, and that the State was in far too feeble a condi tion to repel such attacks, from which it bad hitherto only been saved by the repeated representations of the Government of Natal. The next paragraphs I will quote as they stand, for they sum up tbe reasons for the Annexation. \" That the Secoc\u0153ni war, which would have pro duced but little effect on a healthy constitution, has not only proved suddenly fatal to the resources and reputation of the Bepublic, but has shown itself to be a culminating point in the history of South Africa, in that a Makatee or Basuto tribe, unwarlike and of no account in Zulu estimation, successfully withstood tbe strength of the State, and disclosed for the first time to the native powers outside the Bepublic, from tbe Zambesi to the Cape, the great change that had taken place in the relative strength of the white and black races, that this disclosure at once shook the prestige of the white man in South Africa, and placed every European community in peril, that this common danger has caused universal anxiety, has given to all con cerned the right to investigate its cause, and to protect themselves from its consequences, and has imposed the duty upon those who have tbe power to shield enfeebled civilisation from tbe encroachments of bar barism and inhumanity.\" It proceeds to point out that the Transvaal will be the first to suffer from the results of its own policy, and that it is for every"], [255, "THE ANNEXATION. 171 reason perfectly impossible for Her Majesty's Govern ment to stand by and see a friendly white State ravaged, knowing that its own possessions will be the next to suffer. That Her Majesty's Government, being persuaded that the only means to prevent such a catastrophe would be by the annexation of the country, and, knowing that this was the wish of a large proportion of the inhabitants of the Transvaal, the step must be taken. Next follows the formal annexation. Together with the proclamation, an address was issued by Sir T. Shepstone to the burghers of the State, lay-ing the facts before them in a friendly manner, more suited to their mode of thought than it was possible to do in a formal proclamation. This document, the issue of which was one of those touches that insured the success of the Annexation, was a powerful summing up in colloquial language of the arguments used in the proclamation, strengthened by quotations from the speeches of the President. It ends with these words : \" It remains only for me to beg of you to consider and weigh what I have said calmly and without undue prejudice. Let not mere feeling or sentiment prevail over your judgment. Accept what Her Majesty's Government intends shall be, and what you will soon find from experience, is a blessing not only to you and your children, but to the whole of South Africa through you, and believe that I speak these words to you as a friend from my heart.\" Two other proclamations were also issued, one notifying the assumption of the office of Administrator of the Government by Sir T. Shepstone, and the other"], [256, "172 THE TRANSVAAL. repealing the war-tax, which was doubtless an unequal and oppressive impost. I have in the preceding pages stated all the prin cipal grounds of the Annexation and briefly sketched the history of that event. In tbe next chapter I propose to follow the fortunes of the Transvaal under British Bule."], [257, "173 CHAPTEB IV. THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. The news of the Annexation was received all over the country with a sigh of relief, and in many parts of it with great rejoicings. At the Gold Fields, for instance, special thanksgiving services were held, and \" God save the Queen\" was sung in church. Nowhere was there the slightest disturbance, but, on the contrary, addresses of congratulation and thanks literally poured in by every mail, many of them signed by Boers who have since been conspicuous for their bitter opposition to English rule. At first, there was some doubt as to what would be the course taken under the circum- stances by the volunteers enlisted by tbe late Bepublic. Major Clarke, B.A., was sent to convey the new-s, and to take command of them, unaccompanied save by his Kafir servant. On arrival at the principal fort, be at once ordered tbe Bepublican flag to be hauled down and the Union Jack run up, and bis orders were promptly obeyed. A few days afterwards some mem bers of the force thought better of it, and having made up their minds to kill him, came to the tent where he was sitting to carry out their purpose. On learning their kind intentions, Major Clarke fixed bis eye-glass in his eye, and after steadily glaring at them through"], [258, "i74 THE TRANSVAAL. it for some time, said, \" You are all drunk, go back to your tents.\" The volunteers, quite overcome by his coolness and tbe fixity of bis gaze, at once slipped off, and there was no further trouble. About three weeks as ter the Annexation, tbe I-I3th Eegiment arrived at Pretoria, having been very well received all along tbe road by tbe Boers, who came from miles round to bear the band play. Its entry into Pretoria was quite a sight ; the whole population turned out to meet it ; indeed the feeling of rejoicing and relief was so pro found that when the band began to play \" God save the Queen \" some of tbe women burst into tears. Meanwhile the effect of the Annexation on tbe country was perfectly magical. Credit and commerce \u2022were at once restored; tbe railway bonds that were down to nothing in Holland rose with one bound to par, and the value of landed property nearly doubled. Indeed it would have been possible for any one, know ing what was going to happen, to have realised large sums of money by buying land in the beginning of 1877, and selling it shortly after the Annexation. On tbe 24th May, being Her Majesty's birthday, all the native chiefs who were anywhere within reach were summoned to attend the first formal hoisting of the English flag. The day was a general festival, and tbe ceremony was attended by a large number of Boers and natives in addition to all tbe English. At mid day, amidst the cheers \u25a0 of tbe crowd, the salute of artillery, and the strains of \" God save the Queen,\" the Union Jack was run up a lofty flagstaff, and the Trans vaal was formally announced to be British soil. The flag was hoisted by Colonel Brooke, B.E., and tbe present writer. Speaking for myself, I may say that"], [259, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 175 it was one of the proudest moments of my life. Could I have foreseen that I should live to see that same flag, then hoisted with so much joyous ceremony, within a few years shamefully and dishonourably hauled down and buried,1 I think it would have been the most miserable. The Annexation was as well received in England as it was in the Transvaal. Lord Carnarvon wrote to Sir T. Shepstone to convey \"the Queen's entire approval of your conduct since you received Her Majesty's com mission, with a renewal of my own thanks on bebalf of the Government for the admirable prudence and discretion with which you have discharged a great and unwonted responsibility.\" It was also accepted by Parliament with very few dissentient voices, since it was not till afterwards, when the subject became useful as an electioneering howl, that the Liberal party, beaded by our \" powerful popular minister,\" discovered the deep iniquity that had been perpetrated in South Africa. So satisfied were the Transvaal Boers with the change that Messrs. Kruger, Jorissen, and Bok, who formed tbe deputation to proceed to England and present President Burgers' formal protest against the Annexation, found great difficulty in raising one-half of the necessary expenses \u2014 something under one thou sand pounds \u2014 towards the cost of the undertaking. The thirst for independence cannot have been very great when all the wealthy burghers in the Transvaal put together would not subscribe a thousand pounds towards retaining it. Indeed, at this time the members of the deputation themselves seem to have looked upon their 1 The English flag was during the signing of the Convention at Pre toria formally buried by a large crowd of Englishmen and loyal natives."], [260, "176 THE TRANSVAAL. undertaking as being both doubtful and undesirable, since they informed Sir T. Shepstone that they were going to Europe to discharge an obligation which had been imposed upon them, and if tbe mission failed, they would have done their duty. Mr. Kruger said that if they did fail, he would be found to be as faith ful a subject under the new form of government as he had been under the old; and Dr. Jorissen admitted with equal frankness that \" the change was inevitable, and expressed his belief that the cancellation of it would be calamitous.\" Whilst the Annexation was thus well received in the country immediately interested, a lively agitation was commenced in the Western Province of the Cape Colony, a thousand miles away, with a view of inducing the Home Government to repudiate Sir T. Shepstone's act. The reason of this movement was that the Cape Dutch party, caring little or nothing for the real interests of the Transvaal, did care a great deal about their scheme to turn all the white communities of South Africa into a great Dutch Bepublic, to which they thought tbe Annexation would be a deathblow. As I have said elsewhere, it must be borne in mind that the strings of the anti-annexation agitation have all along been pulled in the Western Brovince, whilst tbe Transvaal Boers have played tbe parts of puppets. The instru ments used by the leaders of the movement in the Cape were, for the most part, the discontented and unprincipled Hollander element, a newspaper of an extremely abusive nature called the Volkstcm, and another in Natal known as the Natal Witness, lately edited by the notorious Aylward, which has an almost equally unenviable reputation."], [261, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 177 On the arrival of Messrs. Jorissen and Kruger in England, they were received with great civility by Lord Carnarvon, who was, however, careful to explain to them that the Annexation was irrevocable. In this decision they cheerfully acquiesced, assuring his lord ship of their determination to do all they could to in duce the Boers to accept the new state of things, and expressing their desire to be allowed to serve under the new Government. Whilst these gentlemen were thus satisfactorily ar ranging matters with Lord Carnarvon, Sir. T. Shepstone was making a tour round the country which resembled a triumphal progress more than anything else. He was everywhere greeted with enthusiasm by all classes of the community, Boers, English, and natives, and numer ous addresses were presented to him couched in the warmest language, not only by Englishmen, but also by Boers. It is very difficult to reconcile the enthusiasm of a great number of the inhabitants of the Transvaal for English rule, and the quiet acquiescence of the remain der, at this time, with the decidedly antagonistic atti tude assumed later on. It appears to me, however, that there are several reasons that go far towards accounting for it. The Transvaal, when we annexed it, was in the position of a man with a knife at his throat, who is suddenly rescued by some one stronger than he, on cer tain conditions which at the time be gladly accepts, but afterwards, when tbe danger is passed, wishes to repu diate. In the same way the inhabitants of the South African Bepublic were in the time of need very thank ful for our aid, but after a while, when the recollection of tbeir difficulties bad grown faint, when their debts M"], [262, "178 THE TRANSVAAL. bad been paid and tbeir enemies defeated, they began to think that they would like to get rid of us again, and start fresh on their own account with a clean sheet. What fostered agitation more than anything else, how ever, was the perfect impunity with which it was allowed to be carried on. Had only a little firmness and decision been shown in the first instance there would have been no further trouble. We might have been obliged to confiscate balf-a-dozen farms, and perhaps imprison as many free burghers for a few months, and there it would have ended. Neither Boers or natives under stand our namby-pamby way of playing at government ; they put it down to fear. What they want, and what they expect, is to be governed with a just but a firm hand. Thus when tbe Boers found that they could agi tate with impunity, they naturally enough continued to agitate. Anybody who knows them will understand that it was very pleasant to them to find themselves in possession of that delightful thing, a grievance, and, in stead of stopping quietly at home on tbeir farms, to feel obliged to proceed, full of importance and long words, to a distant meeting, there to spout and listen to tbe spouting of others. It is so much easier to talk politics than to sow mealies. Some attribute the discontent among tbe Boers to tbe postponement of tbe carrying out of the Annexation proclamation promises with re ference to the free institutions to be granted to tbe country, but in my opinion it had little or nothing to do with it. Tbe Boers never understood the question of responsible government, and never wanted that in stitution; what they did want was to be free of all English control, and this they said twenty times in the most outspoken language. I think there is little doubt"], [263, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 179 the causes I have indicated are the real sources of the agitation, though there must be added to them tbeir detestation of our mode of dealing with natives, and of being forced to pay taxes regularly, and also tbe cease less agitation of the Cape wire-pullers, through their agents the Hollanders, and tbeir organs in the press. On the return of Messrs. Kruger and Jorissen to tbe Transvaal, the latter gentleman resumed his duties as Attorney-General, on which occasion, if I remember aright, I myself had the honour of administering to him the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty, that be afterwards kept so well. The former reported the pro ceedings of tbe deputation to a Boer meeting, when be took a very different tone to that in which he addressed Lord Carnarvon, announcing that if there existed a majority of the people in favour of independence, he still was Vice-Bresident of the country. Both these gentlemen remained for some time in the pay of the British Government, Mr. Jorissen as Attorney-General, and Mr. Kruger as member of the Executive Council. The Government, however, at length found it desirable to dispense with their services, though on different grounds. Mr. Jorissen had, like several other members of the Bepublican Government, been a clergyman, and was quite unfit to hold the post of Attorney-General in an important colony like the Transvaal, where legal questions were constantly arising requiring all tbe attention of a trained mind ; and after be bad on several occasions been publicly admonished from the bench, the Government retired him on liberal terms. Needless to say, his opposition to English rule then became very bitter. Mr. Kruger's appointment expired by law in November 1877, and the Government"], [264, "180 THE TRANSVAAL. did not think it advisable to re-employ him. The terms of bis letter of dismissal can be found on page 135 of Blue-book (c. 144), and involving as they do a serious charge of misrepresentation in money matters, are not very creditable to bim. After this event he also pursued tbe cause of independence with increased vigour. During tbe last months of 1877 and tbe first part of 1878 agitation against British rule went on unchecked, and at last grew to alarming proportions, so much so that Sir T. Shepstone, on bis return from tbe Zulu border in March 1878, where be had been for some months discussing the vexed and dangerous question of tbe boundary line with the Zulus, found it necessary to issue a stringent proclamation warning the agitators that their proceedings and meetings were illegal, and would be punished according to law. This document, which was at the time vulgarly known as the \" Hold your-jaw\" proclamation, not being followed by action, produced but little effect. On tbe 4th April 1878 another Boer meeting was convened, at which it was decided to send a second deputation to England, to consist this time of Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, with Mr. Bok as secretary. This deputation proved as abortive as tbe first, Sir. M. Hicks Beach assuring it, in a letter dated 6th August 1878, that it is \"impossible, for many reasons, ... that the Queen's sovereignty should now be withdrawn.\" Whilst the Government was thus hampered by in ternal disaffection, it had also many other difficulties on its bands. First, there was the Zulu boundary question, which was constantly developing new dangers to the country. Indeed, it was impossible to say what"], [265, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 1S1 might happen in that direction from one week to another. Nor were its relations with Secoc\u0153ni satisfactory. It will be remembered that just before tbe Annexation this chief had expressed his earnest wish to become a British subject, and even paid over part of tbe fine demanded from him by the Boer Government to tbe Civil Commissioner, Major Clarke. In March 1878, however, his conduct towards the Government under went a sudden change, and he practically declared war. It afterwards appeared, from Secoc\u0153ni's own statement, that be was instigated to this step by a Boer, Abel Erasmus by name \u2014 the same man who was concerned in the atrocities in tbe first Secoc\u0153ni war \u2014 who con stantly encouraged him to continue the struggle. I do not propose to minutely follow the course of this long war, which, commencing in the beginning of 1878, did not come to an end till after the Zulu war : when Sir Garnet Wolseley attacked Secoc\u0153ni's stronghold with a large force of troops, volunteers, and Swazi allies, and took it with great slaughter. The losses on our side were not very heavy, so far as white men were con cerned, but the Swazis are reported to have lost 400 killed and 500 w-ounded. The struggle was, during the long period preceding the final attack, carried on with great courage and ability by Major Clarke, B.A., C.M.G., whose force, at the best of times, only consisted of 200 volunteers and ioo Zulus. With this small body of men he contrived, however, to keep Secoc\u0153ni in check, and to take some important strongholds. It was marked also by some striking acts of individual bravery, of which one, per formed by Major Clarke himself, whose reputation for cool courage and presence of mind in danger is unsur-"], [266, "182 THE TRANSVAAL. passed in South Africa, is worthy of notice ; and which, had public attention been more concentrated on tbe Seco c\u0153ni war, would doubtless have won him the Victoria Cross. On one occasion, on visiting one of the outlying forts, he found that a party of hostile natives, who were coming down to tbe fort on the previous day with a flag of truce, bad been accidentally fired on, and had at once retreated. As bis system in native warfare was always to try and inspire bis enemy with perfect faith in the honour of Englishmen, and their contempt of all tricks and treachery even towards a foe, be was very angry at this occurrence, and at once, unarmed and unat tended save by his native servant, rode up into the mountains to the kraal from which tbe white flag party had come on the previous day, and apologised to the chief for what bad happened. When I consider how very anxious Secoc\u0153ni's natives were to kill or capture Clarke, whom they held in great dread, and how terrible the end of so great a captain would in all probability have been had be been taken alive by these masters of refined torture, I confess that I think this act of gentle manly courage is one of the most astonishing things I ever beard of. When he rode up those hills he must have known that be was probably going to meet his death at the hands of justly incensed savages. When Secoc\u0153ni heard of what Major Clarke had done he was so pleased that he shortly afterwards released a volun teer whom he had taken prisoner, and who would other wise, in all probability, have been tortured to death. I must add that Major Clarke himself never reported or alluded to this incident, but an account of it can be found in a despatch written by Sir 0. Lanyon to the Secretary of State, dated 2d February 1880."], [267, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 1S3 Concurrently with, though entirely distinct from, the political agitation that was being carried on among the Boers having for object the restoration of independence, a private agitation was set on foot by a few disaffected persons against Sir T. Shepstone, with the view of ob taining his removal from office in favour of a certain Colonel Weatherley. The details of this impudent plot are so interesting, and the plot itself so typical of the state of affairs with which Sir T. Shepstone had to deal, that I will give a short account of it. After the Annexation had taken place, there were naturally enough a good many individuals who found themselves disappointed in the results so far as they personally were concerned ; I mean that they did not get so much out of it as they expected. Among these was a gentleman called Colonel Weatherley, who had come to the Transvaal as manager of a gold-mining company, but getting tired of that had taken a pro minent part in the Annexation, and who, being subse quently disappointed about an appointment, became a bitter enemy of the Administrator. I may say at once that Colonel Weatherley seems to me to have been throughout the dupe of the other conspirators. The next personage was a good-looking desperado, who called himself Captain Gunn of Gunn, and who was locally somewhat irreverently known as the very Gunn of very Gunn. This gentleman, whose former career had been of a most remarkable order, was, on tbe annexation of the country, found in the public prison charged with having committed various offences, but on Colonel Weatberley's interesting himself strongly on his behalf, he was eventually released without trial. On his release, he requested the Administrator to pub-"], [268, "THE TRANSVAAL. 1 84 lisb a Government notice declaring him innocent of the charges brought against him. This Sir. T. Shepstone declined to do, and so, to use bis own words, in a des patch to tbe High Commissioner on the subject, Captain Gunn of Gunn at once became \" what in this country is called a patriot.\" The third person concerned was a lawyer, who bad \u00abot into trouble on the Diamond Fields, and who felt himself injured because tbe rules of the High Court did not allow him to practise as an advocate. The quartette was made up by Mr. Celliers, tbe editor of the patriotic organ, the Volkstem, who, since he had lost the Government printing contract, found that no language could be too strong to apply to tbe personnel of the Government, more especially its bead. Of course, there was a lady in it ; what plot would be complete without? She was Mrs. Weatherley, now, I believe, Mrs. Gunn of Gunn. These gentlemen began operations by drawing up a long petition to Sir Bartle Frere as High Com missioner, setting forth a string of supposed grievances, and winding up with a request that the Administrator might be \" promoted to some other sphere of political usefulness.\" This memorial was forwarded by the \" committee,\" as they called themselves, to various parts of the country for signature, but without tbe slightest success, tbe fact of the matter being that it was not the Annexor but the Annexation that tbe Boers objected to. At this stage in the proceedings Colonel Weatherley went to try and forward the good cause with Sir Bartle Frere at the Cape. His letters to Mrs. Weatherley from tbence, afterwards put into Court in the celebrated divorce case, contained many interesting accounts of"], [269, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 185 his attempts in that direction. I do not think, however, that he was cognisant of what was being concocted by his allies in Fretoria, but being a very vain, weak man, was easily deceived by them. With all his faults he was a gentleman. As soon as he was gone a second petition was drawn up by the \" committee,\" showing \"the advisability of immediately suspending our present Administrator, and temporarily appointing and recom mending for Her Majesty's royal and favourable con sideration an English gentleman of high integrity and honour, in whom the country at large has respect and confidence.\" Tbe English gentleman of bigb integrity and honour of course proves to be Colonel Weatherley, whose appointment is, further on, \" respectfully but earnestly requested,\" since be had \" thoroughly gained the affec tions, confidence, and respect of Boers, English, and other Europeans in this country.\" But whilst it is comparatively easy to write petitions, there is some times a difficulty in getting people to sign them, as proved to be tbe case with reference to the documents under consideration. When the \" committee \" and the employe's in the office of tbe Volkstem bad affixed their valuable signatures it was found to be impossible to induce anybody else to follow tbeir example. Now, a petition with some half dozen signatures attached would not, it was obvious, carry much weight with tbe Imperial Government, and no more could be obtained. But really great minds rise superior to such difficul ties, and so did the \" committee,\" or some of them, or one of them. If they could not get genuine signatures to their petitions, they could at any rate manufacture them. This great idea once bit out, so vigorously was"], [270, "186 THE TRANSVAAL. it prosecuted that they, or some of them, or one of them, produced in a very little while no less than 3883 signatures, of which sixteen were proved to be genuine, five were doubtful, and all the rest fictitious. But the gentleman, whoever he was, who was the working part ner in the scheme \u2014 and I may state, by way of paren thesis, that when Gunn of Gunn was subsequently arrested, petitions in process of signature were found under the mattress of bis bed \u2014 calculated without his host. He either did not know, or bad forgotten, that on receipt of sucb documents by a superior officer, they are at once sent to tbe officer accused to report upon. This course was followed in the present case, and the petitions were discovered to be gross impostures. The ingenuity exercised by their author or authors was really very remarkable, for it must be remembered that not one of the signatures was forged; they were all invented, and had, of course, to be written in a great variety of hands. The plan generally pursued was to put down the names of people living in the country, with slight variations. Thus \" De Uilliers \" became \" De IFilliers,\" and \" Van Zy\\ \" \" Van Zul.\" I remember that my own name appeared on one of the petitions with some slight alteration. Some of the names were evidently meant to be facetious. Thus there was a \" Jan Verneuker,\" which means \"John the Cheat.\" Of the persons directly or indirectly concerned in this rascally plot, the unfortunate Colonel Weatherley sub sequently apologised to Sir T. Shepstone for his share in the agitation, and shortly afterwards died fighting bravely on Kambula. Captain Gunn of Gunn and Mrs. Weatherley, after having given rise to the most remarkable divorce case I ever heard \u2014 it took fourteen"], [271, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 187 days to try \u2014 were, on the death of Colonel Weatherley, united in the bonds of holy matrimony, and are, I believe, still in Pretoria. The lawyer vanished I know not where, whilst Mr. Celliers still continues to edit that admirably conducted journal the Volkstem; nor, if I may judge from the report of a speech made by him recently at a Boer festival, which, by the way, was graced by the presence of our representative, Mr. Hudson, the British Besident, has his right hand for gotten its cunning, or rather bis tongue lost the use of those peculiar and recherche' epithets that used to adorn the columns of the Volkstem. I see that he, on this occasion, denounced tbe English element as being \" poisonous and dangerous \" to a State, and stated, amidst loud cheers, that \" he despised \" it. Mr. Cellier's lines have fallen in pleasant places; in any other country he would long ago have fallen a victim to tbe stern laws of libel. I recommend him to the notice of enterprising Irish newspapers. Such is the freshness and vigour of his style that I am confident he would make the fortune of any Hibernian journal. Some little time after the Gunn of Gunn frauds a very sad incident happened in connection with the govern ment of the Transvaal. Shortly after the Annexation, the Home Government sent out Mr. Sergeaunt, C.M.G., one of the Crown Agents for the Colonies, to report on the financial condition of the country. He was accom panied, in an unofficial capacity, amongst other gentle men, by Captain Patterson and his son, Mr. J. Sergeaunt; and when he returned to England, these two gentlemen remained behind to go on a shooting expedition. About this time Sir Bartle Frere was anxious to send a friendly mission to Lo Bengula, king of tbe Matabele, a branch of"], [272, "1 88 THE TRANSVAAL. the Zulu tribe, living up towards tbe Zambesi. This chief had been making himself unpleasant by causing traders to be robbed, and it was thought desirable to establish friendly relations with bim, so it was suggested to Captain Batterson and Mr. Sergeaunt that they should combine business with pleasure, and go on a mission to Lo Bengula, an offer which they accepted, and shortly afterwards started for Matabeleland with an interpreter and a few servants. They reached tbeir destination in safety ; and having concluded their busi ness with tbe king, started on a visit to the Zambesi Falls on foot, leaving tbe interpreter with tbe waggon. The falls were about twelve days' walk from the king's kraal, and they were accompanied thither by young Mr. Thomas, the son of the local missionary, two Kafir servants, and twenty native bearers supplied by Lo Bengula. The next thing that was beard of them was that they had all died through drinking poisoned water, full details of tbe manner of tbeir deaths being sent down by Lo Bengula. In the first shock and confusion of such news it was not very closely examined, at any rate by tbe friends of tbe dead men, but, on reflection, there were several things about it that appeared strange. For instance, it was well known that Captain Patterson had a habit, for which, indeed, we bad often laughed at bim, of, however thirsty be might be, always having bis water boiled when be was travelling, in order to destroy impurities, and it seemed odd that he should on this one occasion have neglected the precaution. Also, it was curious that the majority of Lo Bengula's bearers appeared to have escaped, whereas all the others were, without exception, killed ; nor even in that district is"], [273, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 189 it usual to find water so bad that it will kill with tbe rapidity it had been supposed to do in this case, unless indeed it had been designedly poisoned. These doubts of tbe poisoning-by-bad-water-story resolved themselves into certainty when the waggon returned in charge of the interpreter, when, by putting two and two together, we were able to piece out the real history of tbe diabolical murder of our poor friends with con siderable accuracy, a story which shows what blood thirsty wickedness a savage is capable of when he fancies his interests are threatened. It appeared that, when Captain Batterson first inter viewed Lo Bengula, he was not at all well received by him. I must, by way of explanation, state that there exists a pretender to his throne, Kruman by name, who, as far as I can make out, is the real heir to the kingdom. This man had, for some cause or other, fled tbe country, and for a time acted as gardener to Sir T. Shepstone in Natal. At the date of Messrs. Patterson and Sergeaunt's mission to Matabeleland he was living, I believe, in the Transvaal. Captain Patterson, on finding himself so ill received by the king, and not being sufficiently acquainted with the character of savage chiefs, most unfortunately, either by accident or design, dropped some bint in the course of conversation about this Kruman. From that moment Lo Bengula's conduct towards the mission entirely changed, and, dropping his former tone, be became profusely civil; and from that moment, too, be doubtless determined to kill them, probably fearing that they might forward some scheme to oust him and place Kruman, on whose claim a large portion of his people looked favourably, on the throne."], [274, "THE TRANSVAAL. 190 When their business was done, and Captain Patter son told the king that they were anxious, before returning, to visit tbe Zambesi Falls, be readily fell in with tbeir wish, but, in tbe first instance, refused permission to young Thomas, the son of the missionary, to accompany them, only allowing bim to do so on the urgent representations of Captain Patterson. Tbe reason of this was, no doubt, that be bad kindly feelings towards the lad, and did not wish to include bim in tbe slaughter. Captaiii Patterson was a man of extremely methodical habits, and, amongst other things, was in the habit of making notes of all that he did. His note-book bad been taken off bis body, and sent down to Pretoria with the other things. In it we found entries of his preparations for the trip, including the number and names of tbe bearers provided by Lo Bengula. , We also found tbe chronicle of tbe first three days' journey, and that of the morning of the fourth day, but there the record stopped. The last entry was probably made a few minutes before be was killed; and it is to be observed that there was no entry of tbe party having been for several days without water, as stated by the messengers, and then finding the poisoned water. This evidence by itself would not have amounted to much, but now comes the curious part of tbe story, showing the truth of tbe old adage, \" Murder will out.\" It appears that when the waggon was coming down to Pretoria in charge of tbe interpreter, it was outspanned one day outside the borders of Lo Bengula's country, when some Kafirs \u2014 Becbuanas, I think \u2014 came up, asked for some tobacco, and fell into conversation with the driver, remarking that be bad come up with a full"], [275, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 191 waggon,* and now he went down with an empty one. The driver replied by lamenting the death by poisoned water of bis masters, whereupon one of the Kafirs told him the following story : \u2014 He said that a brother of bis was out hunting, a little while back, in the desert for ostriches, with a party of other Kafirs, when hearing shots fired some way off, they made for the spot, thinking that white men were out shooting, and that they would be able to beg meat. On reaching the spot, which was by a pool of water, they saw the bodies of three white men lying on the ground, and also those of a Hottentot and a Kafir, surrounded by an armed party of Kafirs. They at once asked tbe Kafirs what they had been doing killing the white men, and were told to be still, for it was by \" order of the king.\" They then learned tbe whole story. It appeared that the white men bad made a mid-day halt by the water, when one of tbe bearers, who bad gone to the edge of the pool, suddenly shouted to them to come and look at a great snake in the water. Captain Patterson ran up, and, as he leaned over the edge, was instantly killed by a blow with an axe ; the others were then shot and asse^aied. The Kafir further described the clothes that bis brother had seen on the bodies, and also some articles that had been given to his party by tbe mur derers, that left little doubt as to the veracity of bis story*-. And so ended the mission to Matabeleland. No public notice was taken of the matter, for the obvious reason that it was impossible to get at Lo Ben gula to punish bim ; nor would it have been easy to come by legal evidence to disprove the ingenious story of tbe poisoned water, since anybody trying to reach the spot of tbe massacre would probably fall a victim"], [276, "THE TRANSVAAL. 192 to some similar accident before be got back again. It is devoutly to be hoped that the punishment he deserves will sooner or later overtake the author of this devilish and wholesale murder. The beginning of 1879 was signalised by tbe com mencement of operations in Zululand and by the news of the terrible disaster at Isandhlwana, which fell on Bretoria like a thunderclap. It was not, however, any surprise to those who were acquainted with Zulu tactics and with the plan of attack adopted by tbe English commanders. In fact, I know that one solemn warning of what would certainly happen to bim if he persisted in bis plan of advance was addressed to Lord Cbelms ford, through the officer in command at Pretoria, by a gentleman whose position and long experience of the Zulus and tbeir mode of attack should have carried some weight. If it ever reached bim, be took, to the best of my recollection, no notice of it whatever. But though some such disaster was daily expected by a few, the majority both of soldiers and civilians never dreamed of anything of the sort, the general idea being that the conquest of Cetywayo was a very easy under taking ; and the shock produced by tbe news of Isandhl wana was proportionately great, especially as it reached Bretoria in a much exaggerated form. I shall never forget the appearance of the town that morning ; busi ness was entirely suspended, and the streets were filled with knots of men talking, with scared faces, as well they might : for there was scarcely anybody but bad lost a friend, and many thought that their sons or brothers were among the dead on that bloody field. Among others, Sir T. Shepstone lost one son, and thought for some time that be bad lost three."], [277, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 193 Shortly after this event Sir Theophilus went to Eng land to confer with the Secretary of State on various matters connected with the Transvaal, carrying with him the affection and respect of all who knew him, not excepting the majority of the malcontent Boers. He was succeeded by Colonel, now Sir Owen Lanyon, who was appointed to administer the Government during the absence of Sir T. Shepstone. By the Boers, however, the news of our disaster was received with great and unconcealed rejoicing, or at least by the irreconcilable portion of that people. England's necessity was their opportunity, and one of which they certainly meant to avail themselves. Accordingly, notices were sent out summoning the bumhers of the Transvaal to attend a mass meeting on the 1 8th March, at a place about thirty miles from Pretoria. Emissaries were also sent to native chiefs, to excite them to follow Cetywayo's example, and massacre all the English within reach, of whom a man called Solomon Prinsloo was one of the most active. The natives, however, notwithstanding the threats used towards them, one and all declined the invitation. It must not be supposed that all the Boers who attended these meetings did so of their own free will ; on the contrary, a very large number came under com pulsion, since they found that the English authorities were powerless to give them protection. The recal citrants were threatened with all sorts of pains and penalties if they did not attend, a favourite menace being that they should be made \"biltong\" of when the country was given back (i.e., be cut into strips and hung in the sun to dry). Few, luckily for them selves, were brave enough to tempt fortune by refusing x"], [278, "THE TRANSVAAL. 194 to come, but those who did have had to leave the country since tbe war. Whatever were the means employed, the result was an armed meeting of about 3000 Boers, who evidently meant mischief. Just about this time a corps had been raised in Pre toria, composed, for the most part, of gentlemen, and known as the Pretoria Horse, for tbe purpose of pro ceeding to the Zulu border, where cavalry, especially cavalry acquainted with tbe country, was earnestly needed. In tbe emergency of the times officials were allowed to join this corps, a permission of which I availed myself, and was elected one of the lieutenants.1 The corps was not, after all, allowed to go to Zululand on account of tbe threatening aspect adopted by the Boers, against whom it was retained for service. In my capacity as an officer of tbe corps I was sent out with a small body of picked men, all good riders and light weights, to keep up a constant communication between the Boer camp and the Administrator, and found tbe work both interesting and exciting. My headquarters were at an inn about twenty-five miles from Bretoria, to which our agents in the meeting used to come every evening and report bow matters were proceeding, whereupon, if tbe road was clear, I des patched a letter to headquarters ; or, if I feared that the messengers would be caught en route by Boer patrols and searched, I substituted different coloured ribbons according to what I wished to convey. There was a relief hidden in the trees or rocks every six miles, all 1 It is customary in South African volunteer forces to allow the members to elect their own officers, provided the men elected are such as the Government approves. This is done, so that the corps may not afterwards be able to declare that they have no confidence in their officers in action, or to grumble at their treatment by them."], [279, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. ' 195 day and most of the night, whose business it was to take the despatch or ribbon and gallop on with it to the next station, in which way we used to get the despatches into town in about an hour and a quarter. On one or two occasions the Boers came to the inn and threatened to shoot us, but as our orders were to do nothing unless our lives were actually in danger, we took no notice. The officer who came out to relieve me had not, however, been there more than a day or two before be and all his troopers were bunted back into Bretoria by a large mob of armed Boers whom they only escaped by very hard riding. Meanwhile the Boers were by degrees drawing nearer and nearer to tbe town, till at last they pitched their laagers within six miles, and practically besieged it. All business was stopped, the houses w-ere loopholed and fortified, and advantageous positions were occupied by the military and the various volunteer corps. The building, normally in the occupation of the Government mules, fell to the lot of the Pretoria Horse, and, though it was undoubtedly a post of honour, I honestly declare that I have no wish to sleep for another month in a mule stable that has not been cleaned out for several years. However, by sinking a well, and erecting bas tions and a staging for sharpshooters, we converted it into an excellent fortress, though it would not have been of much use against artillery. Our patrols used to be out all night, since we chiefly feared a night attack, and generally every preparation was made to resist the onset that was hourly expected, and I believe that it was that state of preparedness that alone pre vented it. Whilst this meeting was going on, and when matters"], [280, "196 THE TRANSVAAL. bad come to a point that seemed to render war inevi table, Sir Bartle Frere arrived at Pretoria and bad several interviews with the Boer leaders, at which they persisted in demanding their independence, and nothing short of it. After a great deal of talk tbe meeting finally broke up without any actual appeal to arms, though it had, during its continuance, assumed many of the rights of government, such as stopping post-carts and individuals, and sending armed patrols about the country. The principal reason of its break-up was that tbe Zulu war was now drawing to a close, and the leaders saw that there would soon be plenty of troops available to sup press any attempt at revolt, but they also saw to what lengths they could go with impunity. They bad for a period of nearly tw-o months been allowed to throw the whole country into confusion, to openly violate tbe laws, and to intimidate and threaten Her Majesty's loyal subjects with war and death. Tbe lesson was not lost on them; but they postponed action till a more favourable opportunity offered. Sir Bartle Frere before his departure took an oppor tunity at a public dinner given him at Potchefstroom of assuring the loyal inhabitants of the country that the Transvaal would never be given back. Meanwhile a new Pharaoh had arisen in Egypt, in the shape of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and on the 29th June 1879 we find him communicating tbe fact to Sir 0. Lanyon in very plain language, telling bim that he disapproved of his course of action with regard to Secoc\u0153ni, and that \"in future you will please take orders only from me.\" As soon as Sir Garnet had completed his arrange ments for the pacification of Zululand, he proceeded"], [281, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 197 to Pretoria, and having caused himself to be sworn in as Governor, set vigorously to work. I must say that in his dealings with tbe Transvaal he showed great judgment and a keen appreciation of what tbe country needed, namely, strong government; the fact of the matter being, I suppose, that being very popular with the Home authorities he felt that he could more or less command their support in what he did, a satisfaction not given to most governors, who never know but that they may be thrown overboard in emergency to lighten the ship. One of his first acts was to issue a proclamation, stating that, \" Whereas it appears that, notwithstand- ing repeated assurances of contrary effect given by Her Majesty's representatives in this territory, uncertainty or misapprehension exists amongst some of Her Majesty's subjects as to the intention of Her Majesty's Govern- ment regarding the maintenance of British rule and sovereignty over tbe territory of the Transvaal: and whereas it is expedient that all grounds for such uncer- tainty or misapprehension should be removed once and for all beyond doubt or question : now therefore I do hereby proclaim and make known, in tbe name and on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, that it is the will and determination of Her Majesty's Government that this Transvaal territory shall be, and shall continue to be for ever, an integral portion of Her Majesty's dominions in South Africa.\" Alas ! Sir G. Wolseley's estimate of the value of a solemn pledge thus made in the name of Her Majesty, whose word has hitherto been held to be sacred, differed greatly to that of Mr. Gladstone and his Government. Sir Garnet Wolseley's operations against Secoc\u0153ni"], [282, "THE TRANSVAAL. 198 proved eminently successful, and were the best arranged bit of native warfare that I have yet beard of in South Africa. One blow was struck, and only one, but that was crushing. Of course the secret of bis success lay in tbe fact that be bad an abundance of force ; but it was not ensured by that alone, good management being very requisite in an affair of tbe sort, especially where native allies have to be dealt with. The cost of the expedition, not counting other Secoc\u0153ni war expendi ture, amounted to over all of which is now lost to this country. Another step in tbe right direction undertaken by Sir Garnet was the establishment of an Executive Council and also of a Legislative Council, for the establishment of which Letters Latent were sent from Downing Street in November 1880. Meanwhile the Boers, paying no attention to the latter proclamation, for they guessed that it, like other proclamations in the Transvaal, would be a mere bru tum fulmen, bad assembled for another mass meeting, at which they went forward a step, and declared a Government which was to treat with the English authorities. They had now learnt that they could do what they liked with perfect impunity, provided they did not take tbe extreme course of massacring the English. They had yet to learn that they might even do that. At the termination of this meeting, a vote of thanks was passed to \"Mr. Leonard Courtney of London, and other members of tbe British Parlia ment.\" It was wise of the Boer leaders to cultivate Mr. Courtney of London. As a result of this meeting, Bretorius, one of tbe principal leaders, and Bok, tbe secretary, were arrested on a charge of treason, and"], [283, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 199 underwent a preliminary examination ; but as the Secretary of State, Sir M. Hicks Beach, looked rather timidly on the proceeding, and the local authorities were doubtful of securing a verdict, the prosecution was abandoned, and necessarily did more harm than good, being looked upon as another proof of the im potence of the Government. Shortly afterwards, Sir G. Wolseley changed his tactics, and, instead of attempting to imprison Pre torius, offered bim a seat on the Executive Council, with a salary attached. This was a much more sensible way of dealing with him, and he at once rose to the bait, stating his willingness to join the Government after a while, but that he could not publicly do so at the moment lest be should lose his influence with those who were to be brought round through him. It does not, however, appear that Mr. Pretorius ever did actually join the Executive, probably because he found public opinion too strong to allow bim to do so. In December 1879 a new light broke upon the Boers, for in the previous month Mr. Gladstone had been delivering his noted attack on the policy of the Con servative Government. Those Mid-Lothian speeches did harm, it is said, in many parts of the world; but I venture to think that they have proved more mis chievous in South Africa than anywhere else ; at any rate, they have borne fruit sooner. It is not to be supposed that Mr. Gladstone really cared anything about tbe Transvaal or its independence when he was denouncing the hideous outrage that had been perpe trated by the Conservative Government in annexing it. On the contrary, as he acquiesced in the Annexa-"], [284, "THE TRANSVAAL. 200 tion at the time (when Lord Kimberley stated that it was evidently unavoidable), and declined to rescind it when he came into power, it is to be supposed that he really approved of it, or at the least looked on it as a necessary evil. However this may be, any stick will do to beat a dog with, and tbe Transvaal was a con venient point on which to attack the Government. He probably neither knew nor cared what effect his reckless words might have on ignorant Boers thousands of miles away ; and yet, humanly speaking, many a man would ha-\\ e been alive and strong to-day whose bones now whiten the African Veldt had those words never been spoken. Then, for the first time, the Boers learnt that, if they played their cards properly and put on sufficient pressure, they would, in the event of tbe Liberal party coming to office, have little difficulty in coercing it as they wished. There was a fair chance at the time of the utterance of the Mid-Lothian speeches that the agitation would, by degrees, die away ; Sir G. Wolseley had succeeded in winning over Pretorius, and the Boers in general were sick of mass meetings. Indeed, a memorial was addressed to Sir. G. Wolseley by a number of Boers in the Botcbefstroom district, protesting against the main tenance of tbe movement against Her Majesty's rule, which, considering the great amount of intimidation exercised by the malcontents, may be looked upon as a favourable sign. But when it slowly came to be understood among the Boers that a great English Minister had openly espoused tbeir cause, and that be would perhaps soon be all-powerful, the moral gain to them was incal culable. They could now go to the doubting ones and"], [285, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 201 say, \u2014 we must be right about the matter, because, putting our own feelings out of the question, the great Gladstone says we are. We find the committee of the Boer malcontents, at their meeting in March 1880, reading a letter to Mr. Gladstone, \"in which he was thanked for the great sympathy shown in their fate,\" and a hope expressed that, if be succeeded in getting power, be would not forget them. In fact, a charming unanimity prevailed between our great Minister and the Boer rebels, for their interests were the same, the overthrow of the Conservative Government. If, how ever, every leader of the Opposition were to intrigue or countenance intrigues with those who are seeking to undermine the authority of Her Majesty, whether they be Boers or Irishmen, in order to help himself to power, the country might suffer in the long run. But whatever feelings may have prompted Her Majesty's Opposition, the Home Government, and their agent, Sir Garnet Wolseley, blew no uncertain blast, if we may judge from their words and actions. Thus we find Sir Garnet speaking as follows at a banquet given in his honour at Bretoria : \u2014 \" I am told that these men (the Boers) are told to keep on agitating in this way, for a change of Govern ment in England may give them again the old order of things. Nothing can show greater ignorance of English politics than such an idea; I tell you that there is no Government, Whig or Tory, Liberal, Con servative, or Badical, who would dare under any circum stances to give back this country. They would not dare, because the English people would not allow them. To give back the country, what would it mean ? To give it back to external danger, to the danger of attack by"], [286, "THE TRANSVAAL. 202 hostile tribes on its frontier, and who, if the English Government were removed for one day, would make themselves felt the next. Not an official of Government paid for months ; it would mean national bankruptcy. No taxes being paid, the same thing recurring again which had existed before would mean danger without, anarchy and civil war within, every possible misery; the strangulation of trade, and the destruction of property.\" It is very amusing to read this passage by tbe light of after events. On other occasions Sir Garnet Wolseley will probably not be quite so confident as to the future when it is to be controlled by a Badical Government. This explicit and straightforward statement of Sir Garnet's produced a great effect on the loyal inhabitants of the Transvaal, which was heightened by the publica tion of the following telegram from the Secretary of State: \u2014 \"You may fully confirm explicit statements made from time to time as to inability of Her Majesty's Government to entertain any proposal for withdrawal of the Queen's sovereignty.\" On the faith of these declarations many Englishmen migrated to the Transvaal and settled there, whilst those who were in the country now invested all their means, being confident that they would not lose then property through its being returned to the Boers. The excitement produced by Mr. Gladstone's speeches began to quiet down and be forgotten for the time, arrear taxes were paid up by the malcontents, and generally the aspect of affairs was such, in Sir Garnet Wolseley's opinion, as justified him in writing, in April 1880, to the Secretary of State expressing his belief that the"], [287, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 203 agitation was dying out.1 Indeed, so sanguine was he on that point that he is reported to have advised the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment stationed in the territory, a piece of economy that was one of the immediate causes of the revolt. The reader will remember the financial condition of the country at tbe time of the Annexation, which was one of utter bankruptcy. After three years of British ruje, however, we find, notwithstanding the constant agitation that bad been kept up, that the total revenue receipts for the first quarter of 1879 and 1880 amounted to \u00a322,773 and \u00a347,982 respectively. That is to say, that, during the last year of British rule, the revenue of tbe country more than doubled itself, and amounted to 1 In BIue-Book No. (C. 2866) of September 1SS1, which is descrip tive of various events connected with the Boer rising, is published, as an appendix, a despatch from Sir Garnet Wolseley, dated October 1879. This despatch declares the writer's opinion that the Boer discontent is on the increase. Its publication thus \u2014 apropos des holtes \u2014 nearly two 3-ears after it was written, is rather an amusing incident. It certainly gives one the idea that Sir Garnet Wolseley, fearing that his reputation for infallibility might be attacked by scoffers for not having foreseen the Boer rebellion, and perhaps uneasily conscious of other despatches very different in tenor and subsequent in date : and, mindful of the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment by his advice, had caused it to be tacked on to the Blue-Book as a documentary \"I told you so,\" and a proof that, whoever else was blinded, he foresaw. It contains, how ever, the following remarkably true passage : \u2014 \" Even were it not im possible, for many other reasons, to contemplate a withdrawal of our authority from the Transvaal, the position of insecurity in which we sh<juld leave this loyal and important section of the community (the English inhabitants), by exposing them to the certain retaliation of the Boers, would constitute, in my opinion, an insuperable obstacle to retrocession. Subjected to the same danger, moreover, would be those of the Boers, whose superior intelligence and courageous character has rendered them loyal to our Government.\" As the Government took the trouble to republish the despatch, it is a pity that they did not think fit to pay more attention to its contents."], [288, "THE TRANSVAAL. 204 about \u00a3160,000 a-year, taking the quarterly returns at the low average of \u00a340,000. It must, however, be re membered that this sum would have been very largely increased in subsequent years, most probably doubled. At any rate the revenue would have been amply suffi cient to make tbe province one of tbe most prosperous in South Africa, and to have enabled it to shortly repay all debts due to the British Government, and further to provide for its own defence. Trade also, which, in April 1877, was completely paralysed, had increased enor mously. So early as the middle of 1879, the Com mittee of the Transvaal Chamber of Commerce pointed out, in a resolution adopted by them, that the trade of tbe country had in two years risen from almost nothing to the considerable sum of two millions sterling per annum, and that it was entirely in tbe hands of those favourable to British rule. They also pointed out that more than half the land-tax was paid by Englishmen, or other Europeans adverse to Boer Government. Land, too, had risen greatly in value, of which I can give the following instance. About a year after tbe Annexation I, together with a friend, bought a little property on the outskirts of Bretoria, which, with a cottage we put up on it, cost some \u00a3300. Just before tbe rebellion we fortunately determined to sell it, and had no difficulty in getting \u00a3650 for it. I do not believe that it would now fetch a fifty-pound note. I cannot conclude this chapter better than by draw ing attention to a charming specimen of tbe correspond ence between tbe Boer leaders and their friend Mr. Courtney. The letter in question, which is dated 26th June, purports to be written by Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, but it is obvious that it owes its origin to some"], [289, "THE TRANSVAAL UNDER BRITISH RULE. 205 member or members of the Dutch party at the Cape, from whence, indeed, it is written. This is rendered evident both by its general style, and also by the use of such terms as \" Satrap,\" and by references to Napoleon III. and Cayenne, about whom Messrs. Kruger and Joubert know no more than they do of Beru and the Incas. After alluding to former letters, the writers blow a blast of triumph over the downfall of the Conservative Government, and then make a savage attack on the reputation of Sir Bartle Frere. The \" stubborn Satrap \" is throughout described as a liar, and every bad motive imputed to him. Beally, the fact that Mr. Courtney should encourage such epistles as this is enough to give colour to the boast made by some of the leading Boers, after the war, that they bad been encouraged to rebel by a member of the British Government. At the end of this letter, and on the same page of the Blue-Book, is printed the telegram recalling Sir Bartle Frere, dated ist August 1880. It really reads as though tbe second document was consequent on the first. One thing is very clear, tbe feelings of Her Majesty's new Government towards Sir Bartle Frere differed only in the method of their expression from those set forth by the Boer leaders in tbeir letter to Mr. Courtney, whilst their object, namely, to be rid of him, was undoubtedly identical with that of the Dutch party in South Africa."], [290, "206 CHABTEE V. THE BOER REBELLION. When the Liberal ministry became an accomplished fact instead of a happy possibility, Mr. Gladstone did not find it convenient to. adopt tbe line of policy with reference to the Transvaal that might have been ex pected from his utterances whilst leader of the Opposi tion. On the contrary, be declared in Parliament that the Annexation could not be cancelled, and on the 8th June 1880 we find bim, in answer to a Boer petition, written with the object of inducing bim to act up to the spirit of bis words and rescind tbe Annexation, writing thus : \u2014 \" Looking to all the circumstances, both of the Trans vaal and tbe rest of South Africa, and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of disorders which might lead to disastrous consequences, not only to the Transvaal, but to the whole of South Africa, our judgment is, that the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish her sovereignty over the Transvaal ; but, consistently with the mainten ance of that sovereignty, we desire that the white in habitants of the Transvaal should, without prejudice to the rest of tbe population, enjoy the fullest liberty to manage tbeir local affairs. We believe that this liberty may be most easily and promptly conceded to the Trans vaal as a member of a South African confederation.\""], [291, "THE BOER REBELLION. 207 Unless words have lost their signification, this pas sage certainly means that the Transvaal must remain a British colony, but that England will be prepared to grant it responsible government, more especially if it will consent to a confederation scheme. Mr. Gladstone, however, in a communication dated 1st June 1881, and addressed to the unfortunate Transvaal loyals, for whom he expresses \"respect and sympathy,\" interprets his meaning thus: \"It is stated, as I observe, that a promise was given by me that the Transvaal never should be given back. There is no mention of the terms or date of this promise. If the reference be to my letter, of 8th June 1880, to Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, I do not think the language of that letter justifies the de scription given. Nor am I sure in what manner or to what degree the fullest liberty to manage their local affairs, which I then said Her Majesty's Government desired to confer on the white population of the Trans vaal, differs from the settlement now about being made in its bearing on the interests of those whom your Committee represents.\" Such twisting of the meaning of words would, in a private person, be called dishonest. It will also occur to most people that Mr. Gladstone might have spared the deeply wronged and loyal subjects of Her Majesty whom he was addressing the taunt he levels at them in the second paragraph I have quoted. If asked, he would no doubt say that he had not the slightest inten tion of laughing at them ; but when be deliberately tells them that it makes no difference to their interests whether they remain Her Majesty's subjects under a responsible Government, or become the servants of men who were but lately in arms against them and Her"], [292, "THE TRANSVAAL. 208 Majesty's authority, he is either mocking them, or offer ing an insult to tbeir understandings. By way of comment on his remarks, I may add that be had, in a letter replying to a petition from these same loyal inhabitants, addressed to him in May 1880, informed them that he had already told the Boer repre sentatives that the Annexation could not be rescinded. Although Mr. Gladstone is undoubtedly the greatest living master of the art of getting two distinct and o Do opposite sets of meanings out of one set of words, it would try even his ingenuity to make out, to the satis faction of an impartial mind, that be never gave any pledge about tbe retention of the Transvaal. Indeed, it is from other considerations clear that be had no intention of giving up the country to the Boers, whose cause be appears to have taken up solely for electioneering purposes. Had he meant to do so, he would have carried out bis intention on succeeding to office, and, indeed, as things have turned out, it is deeply to be regretted that he did not ; for, bad as such a step would have been, it would at any- rate have had a better appearance than our ultimate surrender after three defeats. It would also have then been possible to secure the repayment of some of the money owing to this country, and to provide for tbe proper treatment of the natives, and tbe compensation of the loyal inhabi tants who could no longer live there : since it must naturally have been easier to make terms with the Boers before they had defeated our troops. On the other band, we should have missed tbe grandest and most soul-stirring display of radical theories, prac tically applied, that has as yet lightened the darkness of this country. But although Mr. Gladstone gave his"], [293, "THE BOER REBELLION. 209 official decision against returning the country, there seems to be little doubt that communications on the subject were kept up with the Boer leaders through some prominent members of the Badical party, who, it was said, went so far as to urge the Boers to take up arms against us. When Mr. White came to this country on behalf of tbe loyalists, after tbe surrender, be stated that this was so at a public meeting, and said further that he had in bis possession proofs of bis state ments. He even went so far as to name the gentleman be accused, and to challenge bim to deny it. I have not been able to gather that Mr. White's statements were contradicted. However this may be, after a pause, agitation in the Transvaal suddenly recommenced with redoubled vigour. It began through a man named Bezeidenhout, who re fused to pay his taxes. Thereupon a waggon was seized in execution under the authority of tbe court and put up to auction, but its sale was prevented by a crowd of rebel Boers, who kicked tbe auctioneer off the waggon and dragged the vehicle away. This was on the 1 1 th November 1880. When this intelligence reached Bre toria, Sir Owen Lanyon sent down a few companies of the 2 1st Begiment, under tbe command of Major Thorn bill, to support the Landdrost in arresting the rioters, and appointed Captain Baas, C.M.G., to act as special messenger to the Landdrost's Court at Botchefstroom, with authority to enrol special constables to assist him to carry out the arrests. On arrival at Potchefstroom Captain Baas found that, without an armed force, it was quite impossible to effect any arrest. On the 26th November Sir Owen Lanyon, realising the gravity of the situation, telegraphed to Sir George Colley, asking o"], [294, "THE TRANSVAAL. 210 that tbe 58th Begiment should be sent back to tbe Transvaal. Sir George replied that be could ill spare it on account of \" daily expected outbreak of Bondos and possible appeal for help from Cape Colony,\" and that the Government must be supported by tbe loyal inhabitants. It will be seen that the Boers had, with some astuteness, chosen a very favourable time to com mence operations. The hands of the Cape Government were full with tbe Basuto war, so no help could be expected from it ; Sir G. Wolseley bad sent away the only cavalry regiment that remained in the country, and lastly, Sir Owen Lanyon bad quite recently allowed a body of 300 trained volunteers, mostly, if not altogether, drawn from among tbe loyalists, to be raised for service in the Basuto war, a serious drain upon the resources of a country so sparsely populated as the Transvaal. Meanwhile a mass meeting had been convened by the Boers for tbe Sth January to consider Mr. Glad stone's letter, but the Bezeidenhout incident had tbe effect of putting forward the date of assembly- by a month, and it was announced that it would be held on the 8th December. Subsequently tbe date was shifted to the 1 5th, and then back again to the Sth. Every effort was made, by threats of future vengeance, to secure tbe presence of as many burghers as pos sible ; attempts were also made to persuade tbe native chiefs to send representatives, and to promise to join in an attack on the English. These entirely failed. The meeting was held at a place called Paarde Kraal, and resulted in the sudden declaration of the Bepub lic and the appointment of tbe famous triumvirate"], [295, "THE BOER REBELLION. 211 Kruger, Joubert, and Bretorius. It then moved into Heidelberg, a little town about sixty miles from Pre toria, and on the 16th December the Bepublic was formally proclaimed in a long proclamation, contain- ing a summary of the events of tbe few preceding years, and declaring the arrangements the malcontents were willing to make with the English authorities. The terms offered in this document are almost iden- tical with those finally accepted by Her Majesty's Government, with tbe exception that in the procla- mation of the 1 6th December the Boer leaders declare their willingness to enter into confederation, and to guide their native policy by general rules adopted in concurrence \" with the Colonies and States of South Africa.\" This was a more liberal offer than that which we ultimately agreed to, but then the circumstances had changed. . This proclamation was forwarded to Sir Owen Lanyon with a covering letter, in which the follow ing words occur : \u2014 \" We declare in the most solemn manner that we have no desire to spill blood, and that from our side we do not wish war. It lies in your bands to force us to appeal to arms in self-defence. . . . We expect your answer within twice twenty four hours.\" I beg to direct particular attention to these para graphs, as they have a considerable interest in view of what followed. Tbe letter and proclamation reached Government House, Pretoria, at 10.30 on the evening of Friday tbe 17th December. Sir Owen Lanyon's proclama tion, written in reply, was handed to the messenger at noon on Sunday, 19th December, or within about"], [296, "THE TRANSVAAL. 212 thirty-six hours of bis arrival, and could hardly have reached tbe rebel camp, sixty miles off, before dawn tbe next day, the 20th December, on which day, at about one o'clock, a detachment of tbe 94th was ambushed and destroyed on tbe road between Middle burg and Pretoria, about eighty miles off, by a force despatched from Heidelberg for that purpose some days before. On the 1 6th December, or tbe same day on which the Triumvirate had despatched tbe pro clamation to Pretoria containing their terms, and ex pressing in tbe most solemn manner that they bad no desire to shed blood, a large Boer force was attacking Potchefstroom. So much then for the sincerity of tbe professions of tbeir desire to avoid bloodshed. The proclamation sent by Sir 0. Lanyon in reply recited in its preamble the various acts of which tbe rebels bad been guilty, including that of having \" wickedly sought to incite the said loyal native inhabitants throughout the province to take up arms against Her Majesty's Government,\" announced that matters had now been put into tbe bands of tbe officer commanding Her Majesty's troops, and pro mised pardon to all who would disperse to their homes. It was at Potchefstroom, which town bad all along been the nursery of the rebellion, that actual hostili ties first broke out. Potchefstroom as a town is much more Boer in its sympathies than Pretoria, which is, or rather was, almost purely English. Sir Owen Lanyon bad, as stated before, sent a small body of soldiers thither to support tbe civil authorities, and bad also appointed Major Clarke, C.M.G., an officer"], [297, "THE BOER REBELLION. 213 of noted coolness and ability, to act as Special Com missioner for the district. Major Clarke's first step was to try, in conjunction with Captain Baas, to raise a corps of volunteers, in which he totally failed. Those of the townsfolk who were not Boers at heart had too many business relations with the surrounding farmers, and perhaps too little faith in the stability of English rule after Mr. Gladstone's utterances, to allow them to indulge in patriotism. At the time of the outbreak, between seventy and eighty thousand sterling was owing to firms in Potchefstroom by neighbouring Boers, a sum amply sufficient to account for their lukewarmness in the English cause. Subsequent events have shown that the Potchefstroom shopkeepers were wise in their generation. On the 15 th December a large number of Boers came into the town and took possession of the print ing-office in order to print tbe proclamation already alluded to. Major Clarke made two attempts to enter the office and see the leaders, but without success. On the 1 6th a Boer patrol fired on some of the mounted infantry, and the fire was returned. These were tbe first shots fired during the war, and they were fired by Boers. Orders were thereupon signalled to Clarke by Lieutenant-Colonel Winsloe, 2 1 st Begi ment, now commanding at the fort which be afterwards defended so gallantly, that he was to commence firing. Clarke was in the Landdrost's office on the Market Square with a force of about twenty soldiers under Captain Falls and twenty civilians under Captain Baas, C.M.G., a position but ill-suited for defensive purposes, from whence fire was accordingly opened,"], [298, "THE TRANSVAAL. 214 the Boers taking up positions in the surrounding houses commanding tbe office. Shortly after tbe com mencement of the fighting, Captain Falls was shot dead whilst talking to Major Clarke, tbe latter having a narrow escape, a bullet grazing bis bead just above the ear. Tbe fighting continued during tbe 17th and till the morning of the 18 th, when the Boers suc ceeded in firing the roof, which was of thatch, by throwing fire-balls on to it. Major Clarke then ad dressed the men, telling them that, though personally he did not care about his own life, be did not see that they could serve any useful purpose by being burned alive, so he should surrender, which be did, with a loss of about six killed and wounded. The camp meanwhile had repulsed with loss the attack made on it, and was never again directly attacked. Whilst these events were in progress at Botcbef stroom, a much more awful tragedy was in preparation on tbe road between Middleburg and Bretoria. On the 23d November, Colonel Bellairs, at tbe request of Sir Owen Lanyon, directed a concentration on Bretoria of most of the few soldiers that there were in tbe territory, in view of tbe disturbed condition of the country. In accordance with these orders, Colonel Anstruther marched from Lydenburg, a town about 180 miles from Bretoria, on the 5th December, with the headquarters and two companies of the 94th Begiment, being a total of 264 men, three women, and two children, and the disproportionately large train of thirty-four ox-waggons, or an ox-waggon capable of carrying five thousand pounds' weight to every eight persons. And here I may remark that it is this enormous amount of baggage, without which it"], [299, "THE BOER REBELLION. 215 appears to be impossible to move tbe smallest body of men, that renders infantry regiments almost useless for service in South Africa except for garrisoning pur poses. Both Zulus and Boers can get over the ground at thrice the pace possible to tbe unfortunate soldier, and both races despise them accordingly. The Zulus call our infantry \" pack oxen.\" In this particular in stance, Colonel Anstruther's defeat, or rather, annihila tion, is to a very great extent referable to his enormous baggage train ; since, in the first place, had be not lost valuable days in collecting more waggons, be would have been safe in Pretoria before danger arose. It must also be acknowledged that his arrangements on the line of march were somewhat reckless, though it can hardly be said that be was ignorant of his danger. Thus we find that Colonel Bellairs wrote to Colonel Anstruther, warning him of the probability of an attack, and impressing on him the necessity of keeping a good look-out, the letter being received and acknowledged by the latter on the 17th December. To this warning was added a still more impressive one that came to my knowledge privately. A gentle man well known to me received, on the morning after tbe troops had passed through the town of Middleburg on their way to Pretoria, a visit from an old Boer with whom he was on friendly terms, who had pur posely come to tell bim that a large patrol was out to ambush the troops on the Bretoria road. My in formant having convinced himself of the truth of tbe statement, at once rode after the soldiers, and catching them up some distance from Middleburg, told Colonel Anstruther what be had heard, imploring him, be said, with all the energy he could command, to take"], [300, "THE TRANSVAAL. 216 better precautions against surprise. The Colonel, how ever, laughed at bis fears, and told him that if the Boers came \" be would frighten them away with the big drum.\" At one o'clock on Sunday, the 20th December, tbe column was marching along about a mile and a half from a place known as Bronker's Splint, and thirty- eigbt miles from Pretoria, when suddenly a large num ber of mounted Boers were seen in loose formation on the left side of tbe road. The band was playing at the time, and the column was extended over more than half a mile, tbe rearguard being about a hundred yards behind the last waggon. The band stopped playing on seeing the Boers, and the troops halted, when a man was seen advancing with a white flag, whom Colonel Anstruther went out to meet, accom panied by Conductor Egerton, a civilian. They met about one hundred and fifty yards from the column, and the man gave Colonel Anstruther a letter, which announced the establishment of the South African Bepublic, stated that until they beard Lanyon's reply to their proclamation they did not know if they were at war or not ; that, consequently, they could not allow any movements of troops, which would be taken as a declaration of war. This letter was signed by Joubert, one of the Triumvirate. Colonel Anstruther replied that be was ordered to Pretoria, and to Pretoria he must go. Whilst this conference was going on, the Boers, of whom there were quite five hundred, had gradually closed round the column, and took up positions behind rocks and trees which afforded them excellent cover, whilst tbe troops were on a bare plain, and before"], [301, "THE BOER REBELLION. 217 Colonel Anstruther reached his men a murderous fire was poured in upon them from all sides. The fire was hotly returned by the soldiers. Most of the officers were struck down by the first volley, having, no doubt, been picked out by the marksmen. The firing lasted about fifteen minutes, and at the end of that time seven out of the nine officers were down killed and wounded ; an eighth (Captain Elliot), one of the two who escaped untouched, being reserved for an even more awful fate. The majority of the men were also down, and bad the hail of lead con tinued much longer it is clear that nobody would have been left. Colonel Anstruther, who was lying badly wounded in five places, seeing what a hopeless state affairs were in, ordered the bugler to sound tbe cease firing, and surrendered. One of the three officers who were not much hurt was, most providentially, Dr. Ward, who had but a slight wound in the thigh ; all the others, except Captain Elliot and one lieutenant, were either killed or died from the effects of their wounds. There were altogether 56 killed and 10 1 wounded, including a woman, Mrs. Fox. Twenty more afterwards died of their wounds. The Boer loss appears to have been very small. After the fight Conductor Egerton, with a sergeant, was allowed to walk into Pretoria to obtain medical assistance, the Boers refusing to give bim a borse, or even to allow him to use bis own. The Boer leader also left Dr. Ward eighteen men and a few stores for the wounded, with which he made shift as best he could. Nobody can read this gentleman's report without being much impressed with the way in which, though wounded himself, be got through his terrible"], [302, "218 THE TRANSVAAL. task of, without assistance, attending to the wants of 101 sufferers. Beginning the task at 2 p.m., it took him till six the next morning before he had seen the last man. It is to be hoped that bis services have met with some recognition. Dr. Ward remained near tbe scene of the massacre with his wounded men till tbe declaration of peace, when be brought them down to Maritzburg, having experienced great difficulty in obtaining food for them during so many weeks. This is a short account of what I must, with reluct ance, call a most cruel and carefully planned massacre. I may mention that a Zulu driver, who was with the rearguard, and escaped into Natal, stated that tbe Boers shot all the wounded men who formed that body. His statement was to a certain extent borne out by the evidence of one of the survivors, who stated that all the bodies found in that part of tbe field (nearly three-quarters of a mile away from the head of the column), had a bullet hole through the head or breast in addition to their other wounds. The Administrator of tbe Transvaal in council thus comments on the occurrence in an official minute : \u2014 \"The surrounding and gradual hemming in under a flag of truce of a force, and the selection of spots from which to direct tbeir fire, as in the case of the unpro voked attack by the rebels upon Colonel Anstruther's force, is a proceeding of which very few like incidents can be mentioned in the annals of civilised warfare.\" Tbe Boer leaders, however, were highly elated at tbeir success, and celebrated it in a proclamation of which the following is an extract : \u2014 \" Inexpressible is the gratitude of tbe burghers for this blessing con ferred on them. Thankful to the brave General F."], [303, "THE BOER REBELLION. 219 Joubert and his men who have upheld the honour of the Bepublic on the battlefield. Bowed down in tbe dust before Almighty God, who had thus stood by them, and, with a loss of over a hundred of the enemy, only allowed two of ours to be killed.\" In view of the circumstances of the treacherous hemming in and destruction of this small body of un prepared men, most people would think this language rather high-flown, not to say blasphemous. On tbe news of this disaster reaching Pretoria, Sir Owen Lanyon issued a proclamation placing the country under martial law. ' As the town was large, straggling, and incapable of defence, all the inhabitants, amounting to over four thousand souls, were ordered up to camp, where the best arrangements possible were made for their convenience. In these quarters they remained for three months, driven from their comfort able homes, and cheerfully enduring all the hardships, want, and discomforts consequent on their position, whilst they waited in patience for the appearance of that relieving column that never came. People in England hardly understand what these men and women went through because they chose to remain loyal. Let them suppose that all the inhabitants of an ordinary English town, with the exception of the class known as poor people, which can hardly be said to exist in a colony, were at an hour's notice ordered \u2014 all, the aged and the sick, delicate women, and tiny children \u2014 to leave their homes to the mercy of the enemy-, and crowd up in a little space under shelter of a fort, with nothing but canvas tents or sheds to cover them from the fierce summer suns and rains, and the coarsest rations to feed them ; whilst tbe"], [304, "THE TRANSVAAL. 220 husbands and brothers were daily engaged with a cun ning and dangerous enemy, and sometimes brought home wounded or dead. They will then have some idea of what was gone through by tbe loyal people of Pretoria, in their weak confidence in tbe good faith of tbe English Government. The arrangements made for tbe defence of tbe town were so ably and energetically carried out by Sir Owen Lanyon, assisted by tbe military officers, that no attack upon it was ever attempted. It seems to me that tbe organisation that could provide for tbe penning up of four thousand people for months, and carry it out without the occurrence of a single un pleasantness or expression of discontent, must have bad something remarkable about it. Of course, it would have been impossible without tbe most loyal co-operation on the part of those concerned. Indeed everybody in the town lent a helping hand ; judges served out rations, members of tbe Executive inspected nuisances, and so forth. There was only one instance of \" striking ; \" and then, of all people in the world, it was the five civil doctors who, thinking it a favour able opportunity to fleece the Government, combined to demand five guineas a-day each for tbeir services. I am glad to say that they did not succeed in their attempt at extortion. On the 23d December, tbe .Boer leaders issued a second proclamation in reply to that of Sir 0. Lanyon of the 1 8th, which is characterised by an utter absence of regard for the truth, being, in fact, nothing but a tissue of impudent falsehoods. It accuses Sir 0. Lanyon of having bombarded women and children, of arming natives against the Boers, and of firing on the Boers"], [305, "THE BOER REBELLION. 221 without declaring war. Not one of these accusations has any foundation in fact, as tbe Boers well knew ; but they also knew that Sir Owen, being shut up in Pretoria, was not in a position to rebut their charges, which they hoped might, to some extent, be believed, and create sympathy for them in other parts of the world. This was the reason of the issue of tbe pro clamation, which well portrays the character of its framers. Life at Pretoria was varied by occasional sorties against the Boer laagers, situated at different points in the neighbourhood, generally about six or eight miles from the town. These expeditions were carried out with considerable success, though with some loss, the heaviest incurred being when the Boers, having treacherously hoisted the white flag, opened a heavy fire on tbe Bretoria forces, as soon as they, beguiled into confidence, emerged from tbeir cover. In the course of the war, one in every four of the Pretoria mounted volunteers was killed or wounded. But perhaps tbe most serious of all tbe difficulties tbe Government had to meet was that of keeping tbe natives in check. As has before been stated, they were devotedly attached to our rule, and, during the three years of its continuance, had undergone what was to them a strange experience, they had neither been murdered, beaten, or enslaved. Naturally they were in no hurry to return to the old order of things, in which murder, flogging, and slavery were events of everyday occurrence. Nor did tbe behaviour of the Boers on the outbreak of the war tend to reconcile them to any such idea. Thus we find that tbe farmers bad pressed a number of natives from Waterberg into"], [306, "THE TRANSVAAL. 222 one of their laagers (Zwart Koppies) ; two of them tried to run away, a Boer saw them and shot them both. Again, on the 7th January, a native reported to tbe authorities at Pretoria that be and some others were returning from tbe Diamond Fields driving some sheep. A Boer came and asked them to sell tbe sheep. They refused, whereupon be went away, but returning with some other Dutchmen fired on tbe Kafirs, kiUing one. On the 2d January information reached Pretoria that on the 26th December some Boers fired on some natives' who were resting outside Botcbefstroom and killed three; tbe rest fled, whereupon tbe Boers took the cattle they had with them. On tbe 1 itb January some men, who bad been sent from Pretoria with despatches for Standerton, were taken prisoners. Whilst prisoners they saw ten men returning from tbe Fields stopped by tbe Boers and ordered to come to tbe laager. They refused and ran away, were fired on, five being killed and one getting his arm broken. These are a few instances of the treatment meted out to the unfortunate natives, taken at haphazard from tbe official reports. There are plenty more of the same nature if anybody cares to read them. As soon as the news of tbe rising reached them, every chief of any importance sent in to offer aid to Government, and many of them, especially Montsioa, our old ally in the Keate Award district, took the loyals of the neighbourhood under their protection. Several took charge of Government property and cattle during the disturbances, and one bad four or five thousand pounds in gold, the product of a recently collected tax, given him to take care of by the Com-"], [307, "THE BOER REBELLION. 223 missioner of bis district, who was afraid that the money would be seized by tbe Boers. In every instance the property entrusted to their charge was returned intact. Tbe loyalty of all the native chiefs under very trying circumstances (for the Boers were constantly attempting to cajole or frighten them into joining them) is a remarkable proof of the great affec tion of the Kafirs, more especially those of the Basuto tribes, who love peace better than war, for the Queen's rule. Tbe Government of Pretoria need only have spoken one word to set an enormous number of armed men in motion against the Boers, with the most serious results to tbe latter. Any other Government in the world would, in its extremity, have spoken that word, but, fortunately for the Boers, it is against English principles to set black against white under any cir cumstances. Besides the main garrison at Pretoria there were forts defended by soldiery and loyals at the following places: \u2014 Potchefstroom, Bustenburg, Lydenburg, Mara bastad, and Wakkerstroom, none of which were taken by the Boers.1 One of the first acts of the Triumvirate was to despatch a large force from Heidelberg with orders to advance into Natal Territory, and seize the pass over the Drakensberg known as Lang's Nek, so as to dispute the advance of any relieving column. This movement was promptly executed, and strong Boer troops patrolled Natal country almost up to Newcastle. The news of tbe outbreak, followed as it was by 1 Colonel Winsloe, however, being short of provisions, was beguiled by the fraudulent representations and acts of the Boer commander into surrendering the fort at Potchefstroom during the armistice."], [308, "THE TRANSVAAL. 224 that of the Bronker's Spruit massacre, and Captain Elliot's murder, created a great excitement in Natal. All available soldiers were at once despatched up country, together with a naval brigade, who, on arrival at Newcastle, brought up tbe strength of the Imperial troops of all arms to about a thousand men. On the ioth January Sir George Colley left Maritzburg to join the force at Newcastle, but at this time nobody dreamt that he meant to attack tbe Nek with such an insignificant column. It was known that tbe loyals and troops who were shut up in the various towns in the Transvaal had sufficient provisions to last for some months, and that there was therefore nothing to necessitate a forlorn hope. Indeed the possibility of Sir George Colley attempting to enter tbe Transvaal was not even speculated upon until just before his advance, it being generally considered as out of tbe question. The best illustration I can give of the feeling that existed about the matter is to quote my own case. I bad been so unfortunate as to land in Natal with my wife and servants just as the Transvaal troubles began, my intention being to proceed to a place I had near Newcastle. For some weeks I remained in Maritz burg, but finding that the troops were to concentrate on Newcastle, and being besides heartily wearied of tbe great expense and discomfort of hotel life in that town, I determined to go on up country, looking on it as being as safe as any place in the colony. Of course tbe possibility of Sir George attacking the Nek before the arrival of the reinforcements did not enter into my calculations, as I thought it a venture that no sensible man would undertake. On the day of"], [309, "THE BOER REBELLION. 225 my start, however, there was a rumour about the town that the General was going to attack tbe Boer position. Though I did not believe it, I thought it as well to go and ask the Colonial Secretary, Colonel Mitchell, privately, if there was any truth in it, adding that if there was, as I had a pretty intimate knowledge of the Boers and their shooting powers, and what the inevitable result of such a move would be, I should certainly prefer, as I bad ladies with me, to remain where I was. Colonel Mitchell told me frankly that he knew no more about Sir George's plans than I did ; but he added I might be sure that so able and prudent a soldier would not do anything rash. His remark concurred with my own opinion ; so I started, and on arrival at Newcastle a week later was met by the intelligence that Sir George had advanced that morning to attack the Nek* To return was almost impossible, since both horses and travellers were pretty nearly knocked up. Also, anybody who has travelled with bis family in summer-time over the awful track of alternate slough and boulders between Maritzburg and Newcastle, known in the colony as a road, will understand that at the time the adventurous voyagers would far rather risk being shot than face a return journey. The only thing to do under the circumstances was to await tbe course of events, which were now about to develop themselves with startling rapidity. The little town of Newcastle was at this time an odd sight, and remained so all through the war. Tbe hotels were crowded to overflowing with refugees, and on every spare patch of land were erected tents, mud huts, canvas houses, and every kind of covering that p"], [310, "THE TRANSVAAL. 226 could be utilised under tbe pressure of necessity, to house the many homeless families who had succeeded in effecting their escape from tbe Transvaal, many of whom were reduced to great straits. On the morning of the 28th January, anybody listening attentively in the neighbourhood of Newcastle could hear the distant boom of heavy guns. We were not kept long in suspense, for in tbe afternoon news arrived that Sir George bad attacked tbe Nek, and failed with heavy loss. The excitement in the town was intense, for, in addition to other considerations, the 58th Begiment, which had suffered most, bad been quartered there for some time, and both the officers and men were personally known to tbe in habitants. Tbe story of the fight is well known, and needs little repetition, and a very sad story it is. The Boers, who at that time were some 2000 strong, were posted and entrenched on steep hills, against which Sir George Colley burled a few hundred soldiers. It was a forlorn hope, but so gallant was the charge, espe cially that of the mounted squadron led by Major Bronlow, that at one time it nearly succeeded. But nothing could stand under tbe withering fire from tbe Boer schanses, and as regards the foot soldiers, they never bad a chance. Colonel Deane tried to take them up the bill with a rush, with the result that by the time they reached the top, some of the men were actually sick from exhaustion, and none could bold a rifle steady. There on the bare hill-top they crouched and lay, whilst the pitiless fire from redoubt and rock lashed them like hail, till at last human nature could bear it no longer, and what was left of"], [311, "THE BOER REBELLION. 227 them retired slowly down the slope. But for many that gallant charge was their last earthly action. As they charged they fell, and where they fell they were afterwards buried. The casualties, killed and wounded, amounted to 195, which, considering the small number of troops engaged in the actual attack, is enormously heavy, and shows more plainly than words can tell the desperate nature of tbe undertaking. Amongst the killed were Colonel Deane, Major Boole, Major Hingeston, and Lieutenant Elwes. Major Essex was the only staff officer engaged who escaped, the same officer who was one of tbe fortunate four who lived through Isandhlwana. On this occasion bis usual good fortune attended him, for though his borse was killed aud his helmet knocked off, be was not touched. The Boer loss was very trivial. Sir George Colley, in bis admirably lucid despatch about this occurrence addressed to the Secretary of State for War, does not enter much into the question as to tbe motives that prompted him to attack, simply stating that bis object was to relieve the besieged towns. He does not appear to have taken into con sideration, what was obvious to anybody who knew the country and the Boers, that even if be bad suc ceeded in forcing the Nek, in itself almost an impossi bility, he could never have operated with any success in the Transvaal with so small a column, without cavalry, and with an enormous train of waggons. He would have been harassed day and night by tbe Boer skirmishers, bis supplies cut off, and bis advance made practically impossible. Also the Nek would have been re-occupied behind him, since be could not have detached sufficient men to bold it, and in all proba-"], [312, "THE TRANSVAAL. 228 bility New-castle, his base of supplies, would have fallen into the bands of the enemy. The moral effect of our defeat on the Boers was very great. Up to this time there bad been many secret doubts amongst a large section of them as to what the upshot of an encounter with the troops might be ; and with this party, in tbe same way that defeat, or even the anxiety of waiting to be attacked, would have turned tbe scale one way-, victory turned it the other. It gave them unbounded confidence in tbeir own superiority, and infused a spirit of cohesion and mutual reliance into their ranks which had before been wanting. Waverers wavered no longer, but gave a loyal adherence to the good cause, and, what was still more acceptable, large numbers of volunteers, \u2014 whatever President Brand may say to tbe contrary, \u2014 poured in from the Orange Free State. What Sir George Colley's motive was in making so rash a move is, of course, quite inexplicable to the outside observer. It was said at the time in Natal that he was a man with a theory : namely, that small bodies of men properly handled were as useful and as likely to obtain tbe object in view as a large force. Whether or no this was so, I am not prepared to say ; but it is undoubtedly the case that very clever men have sometimes very odd theories, and it may be that he was a striking instance in point. For some days after the battle at Lang's Nek affairs were quiet, and it was hoped that they would remain so till the arrival of the reinforcements, which were on their way out. Tbe hope proved a vain one. On the 7th February it was reported that the escort proceeding from Newcastle to the General's camp with"], [313, "THE BOER REBELLION. 229 the post, a distance of about eighteen miles, had been fired on and forced to return. On the 8th, about mid-day, we were all startled by the sound of fighting, proceeding apparently from a bill known as Scheins Hoogte, about ten miles from Newcastle. It was not known that the General con templated any move, and everybody was entirely at a loss to know what was going on, the \u00abeneral idea being, however, that the camp near Lang's Nek bad been abandoned, and that Sir George was retiring on Newcastle. The firing grew hotter and hotter, till at last it was perfectly continuous, the cannon evidently being dis charged as quickly as they could be loaded, whilst their dull booming was accompanied by the unceas ing crash and roll of the musketry. Towards three o'clock the firing slackened, and we thought it was all over, one way or the other, but about five o'clock it broke out again with increased vigour. At dusk it finally ceased. About this time some Kafirs came to my house and told us that an English force was hemmed in on a bill this side of the Ingogo Biver, that they were fighting bravely, but that \" their arms were tired,\" adding that they thought they would be all killed at night. Needless to say w-e spent that night with heavy hearts, expecting every minute to bear the firing begin again, and ignorant of what fate had befallen our poor soldiers on tbe bill. Morning put an end to our suspense, and we then learnt that we had suffered what, under the circumstances, amounted to a crush ing defeat. It appears that Sir George bad moved out with a force of five companies of the 60th Begiment,"], [314, "THE TRANSVAAL. 230 two guns, and a few mounted men, to, in bis own words, \" patrol the road, and meet and escort some waggons expected from Newcastle.\" As soon as be passed the Ingogo be was surrounded by a body of Boers sent after him from Lang's Nek, on a small triangular plateau, and sharply assailed on all sides. With a break of about two hours, from three to five, the assault was kept up till nightfall, with very bad results so far as we were concerned, seeing that out of a body of about 500 men, over 150 were killed and wounded. The reinforcements sent for from the camp apparently did not come into action. For some un explained reason the Boers did not follow up their attack that night, perhaps because they did not think it possible that our troops could effect their escape back to the camp, and considered that the next morn ing would be soon enough to return and finish the business. The General, however, determined to get back, and scratch teams of such mules, riding-horses, and oxen as had lived through tbe day being harnessed to the guns, the dispirited and exhausted survivors of the force managed to ford the Ingogo, now swollen by rain which had fallen in the afternoon, poor Lieutenant Wilkinson, the adjutant of the 60th, losing his life in the operation, and to struggle through tbe dense dark ness back to camp. On the hill-top they had lately held the dead lay thick. There, too, exposed to the driving rain and bitter wind, lay the wounded, many of whom would be dead before the rising of the morrow's sun. It must indeed have been a sight never to be forgotten by those who saw it. The night \u2014 I remember well \u2014 was cold and rainy, the great expanses of hill and"], [315, "THE BOER REBELLION. 231 plain being sometimes lit by the broken gleams of an uncertain moon, and sometimes plunged into intensest darkness by the passing of a heavy cloud. Now and again flashes of lightning threw every crag and outline into vivid relief, and the deep muttering of distant thunder made the wild gloom more solemn. Then a gust of icy wind would come tearing down tbe valleys to be followed by a pelting thunder shower \u2014 and thus the night wore away. When one reflects what discomfort, and even danger, an ordinary healthy person would suffer if left after a hard day's work to lie all night in the rain and wind on the top of a stony mountain, without food, or even water to assuage bis thirst, it becomes to some degree possible to realise what the sufferings of our wounded after tbe battle of Ingogo must have been. Those who survived were next day taken to the hospital at Newcastle. What Sir George Colley's real object was in expos ing himself to tbe attack has never transpired. It can hardly have been to clear the road, as be says in his despatch, because the road was not held by tbe enemy, but only visited occasionally by tbeir patrols. The result of tbe battle was to make the Boers, whose losses were trifling, more confident than ever, and to greatly depress our soldiers. Sir George bad now lost between three and four hundred men out of his column of little over a thousand, which was thereby entirely crippled. Of his staff officers Major Essex now alone survived, his usual good fortune having carried bim safe through the battle of Ingogo. What makes bis repeated escapes the more remarkable is that he was generally to be found in tbe heaviest"], [316, "THE TRANSVAAL. 232 firing. A man so fortunate as Major Essex ought to be rewarded for his good fortune if for no other reason, though, if reports are true, there would be no need to fall back on that to find grounds on which to advance a soldier who has always borne himself so well. Another result of the Ingogo battle was that tbe Boers, knowing that we had no force to cut them off, and always secure of a retreat into tbe Free State, passed round Newcastle in Free State Territory, and descended from fifteen hundred to two thousand strong into Natal for the purpose of destroying the reinforce ments which were now on their way up under General Wood. This was on the 1 ith of February, and from that date till the i8tb the upper districts of Natal were in tbe hands of the enemy, who cut the telegraph wires, looted waggons, stole herds of cattle and horses, and otherwise amused themselves at the expense of Her Majesty's subjects in Natal. It was a very anxious time for those who knew what Boers are capable of, and bad women and children to protect, and who were never sure if their houses would be left standing over their heads from one day to another. Every night we were obliged to place out Kafirs as scouts to give us timely warning of the approach of marauding parties, and to sleep with loaded rifles close to our hands, and sometimes, when things looked very black, in our clothes, with horses ready saddled in the stable. Nor were our fears groundless, for one day a patrol of some five hundred Boers encamped on tbe next place, which by tbe way belonged to a Dutchman, and stole all the stock on it, the property of an Englishman. They also intercepted a train of waggons,"], [317, "THE BOER REBELLION. 233 destroyed the contents, and burnt them. Numerous were the false alarms it was our evil fortune to experi ence. For instance, one night I was sitting in tbe drawing-room reading, about eleven o'clock, with a door leading on to tbe verandah slightly ajar, for the night was warm, when suddenly I beard myself called by name in a muffled voice, and asked if the place was in the possession of tbe Boers. Looking towards the door I saw a full-cocked revolver coming round the corner, and on opening it in some alarm, I could indistinctly discern a line of armed figures in a crouching attitude stretching along the verandah into the garden beyond. It turned out to be a patrol of the mounted police, who bad received information that a large number of Boers had seized tbe place and had come to ascertain the truth of the report. As we gathered from them that the Boers were certainly near, we did not pass a very comfortable night. Meanwhile we were daily expecting to hear that the troops had been attacked along the line of march, and knowing the nature of tbe country and tbe many opportunities it affords for ambuscading and destroying one of our straggling columns encumbered with innumer able waggons, we had the worst fears for the result. At length a report reached us to the effect that the reinforcements were expected on the morrow, and that they were not going to cross the Ingagaan at the ordinary drift, which was much commanded by hills, but at a lower drift on our own place, about three miles from Newcastle, which is only slightly com manded. We also heard that it was the intention of the Boers to attack them at this point and to fall back on my bouse and the bills behind. Accordingly, we"], [318, "THE TRANSVAAL. 234 thought it about time to retreat, and securing a few valuables, such as plate, we made our way into the town, leaving the house and its contents to take their chance. At Newcastle an attack was daily expected, if for no other reason, to obtain possession of the stores collected there. The defences of the place were, however, in a wretched condition, no proper outlook was kept, and there was an utter want of effective organisation. Tbe military element at the camp had enough to do to look after itself, and did not concern itself with the safety of the town ; and the mounted police \u2014 a colonial force paid by the colony \u2014 had been withdrawn from the little forts round Newcastle, as tbe General wanted them for other purposes, and a message sent that the town must defend its own forts. There were, it is true, a large number of able-bodied men in the place who were willing to fight, but they had no organisation. The very laager was not finished until the danger was past. Then there was a large party who were for surrender ing the town to the Boers, because if they fought it might afterwards injure their trade. With this section of tbe population the feeling of patriotism was strong, no doubt, but that of pocket was stronger. I am con vinced that the Boers would have found the capture of Newcastle an easy task, and I confess that what I then saw did not inspire me with great hopes of the safety of the colony when it gets responsible government, and has to depend for protection on burgher forces. Colonial volunteer forces are, I think, as good troops as any in the world ; but an unorganised colonial mob, pulled this way and that by different sentiments and"], [319, "THE BOER REBELLION. 235 interests, is as useless as any other mob, with tbe difference that it is more impatient of control. For some unknown reason tbe Boer leaders provi dentially changed their minds about attacking the rein forcements, and their men were withdrawn to the Nek as swiftly and silently as they had been advanced, and on the 17th February tbe reinforcements marched into Newcastle, to the very great relief of the inhabitants, who had been equally anxious for their own safety and that of the troops. Personally, I was never in my life more pleased to see Her Majesty's uniform ; and we were equally rejoiced on returning home to find that nothing had been injured. After this we had quiet for a while. On the 2 1st February, we heard that two fresh regi ments bad been sent up to the camp at Lang's Nek, and that General Wood had been ordered down country by Sir George Colley to bring up more reinforcements. This item 'of news caused much surprise, as nobody could understand why, now that tbe road was clear, and that there was little chance of its being again blocked, a General should be sent down to do work which could, to all appearance, have been equally well done by tbe officers in command of the reinforcing regiments, with the assistance of their transport riders. It was, however, understood that an agreement had been entered into between the two Generals that no offensive operations should be undertaken till Wood returned. With tbe exception of occasional scares, there was no further excitement till Sunday the 27th February, when, whilst sitting on the verandah after lunch, I thought I beard the sound of distant artillery. Others present differed with me, thinking the sound was caused by thunder, but as I adhered to my opinion, we deter-"], [320, "236 THE TRANSVAAL. mined to ride into town and see. On arrival there, we found the place full of rumours, from which we gathered that some fresb disaster had occurred; and that messages were pouring down the wires from Mount Prospect camp. We then went on to camp, thinking that we should learn more there, but they knew nothing about it, several officers asking us what new \"shave\" we bad got bold of. A considerable number of troops had been marched from Newcastle that morning to go to Mount Prospect, but -when it was realised that something had occurred, they were stopped, and marched back again. Bit by bit we managed to gather the truth. At first we beard that our men had made a most gallant resistance on the hill, mowing down the advancing enemy by hundreds, till at last, their ammunition failing, they fought with their bayonets, using stones and meat tins as missiles. I wish that our subsequent information bad been to the same effect. It appears that on the evening of the 26th, Sir George Colley, after mess, suddenly gave orders for a force of a little over six hundred men, consisting of detachments from no less than three different regi ments, the 58th, 60th, 92d, and the Naval Brigade, to be got ready for an expedition, without revealing his plans to anybody until late in the afternoon ; and then without more ado, marched them up to the top of Majuba \u2014 a great square-topped mountain to the right of, and commanding the Boer position at Lang's Nek. The troops reached the top about three in the morning, after a somewhat exhausting climb, and were stationed at different points of the plateau in a scientific way. Whilst the darkness lasted, they could, by the"], [321, "THE BOER REBELLION. 237 glittering of the watch-fires, trace from this point of vantage the position of the Boer laagers that lay 2000 yards beneath them, whilst the dawn of day revealed every detail of the defensive works, and showed the country lying at their feet like a map. On arrival at tbe top, it was represented to the General that a rough entrenchment should be thrown up, but he would not allow it to be done on account of the men being wearied with their marching up. This was a fatal mistake. Behind an entrenchment, however slight, one would think that 600 English soldiers might have defied the whole Boer army, and much more tbe 200 or 300 men by whom they were hunted down Majuba. It appears that about 10.15 A*M-> Colonel Stewart and Major Fraser again went to General Colley \" to arrange to start the sailors on an entrenchment.\" . . . \" Finding the ground so exposed, tbe General did not give orders to entrench.\" As soon as the Boers found out that the hill was in the occupation of the English, their first idea was to leave the Nek, and they began to inspan with that object, but discovering that there were no guns com manding them, they changed their mind, and set to work to storm the bill instead. As far as I have been able to gather, the number of Boers who took the mountain was about 300, or possibly 400 ; I do not think there were more than that. The Boers them selves declare solemnly that they were only 100 strong, but this I do not believe. They slowly advanced up the hill till about 11.30, when the real attack began, the Dutchmen coming on more rapidly and confidently, and shooting with ever-increasing accuracy, as they found our fire quite ineffective."], [322, "238 THE TRANSVAAL. About a quarter to one, our men retreated to the last ridge, and General Colley was shot through the head. After this, the retreat became a rout, and the soldiers rushed pell-mell down the precipitous sides of tbe hill, the Boers knocking them over by the score as they went, till they were out of range. A few were also, I heard, killed by the shells from tbe guns that were advanced from tbe camp to cover the retreat, but as this does not appear in the reports, perhaps it is not true. Our loss was about 200 killed and wounded, including Sir George Colley, Drs. Landon and Cornish, and Commander Bomilly, who was shot with an explosive bullet, and died after some days' suffering. When the wounded Commander was being carried to a more sheltered spot, it was with great difficulty that tbe Boers w-ere prevented from massacring bim as he lay, they being under the impression that he was Sir Garnet Wolseley. As was tbe case at Ingogo, tbe wounded were left on the battlefield all night in very inclement weather, to which some of them succumbed. It is worthy of note that after tbe fight was over they were treated with considerable kindness by tbe Boers. Not being a soldier, of course, I cannot venture to give any military reasons as to bow it was that what was after all a considerable force was so easily driven from a position of great natural strength ; but I think I may, without presumption, state my opinion as to the real cause, which was the villainous shooting of tbe British soldier. Though the troops did not, as was said at the time, run short of ammunition, it is clear that they fired away a great many rounds at men who, in storming the hill, must necessarily have exposed"], [323, "THE BOER REBELLION. 239 themselves more or less, of whom they managed to hit \u2014 certainly not more than six or seven \u2014 which was the outside of the Boer casualties. From this it is clear that they can neither judge distance nor hit a moving object, nor did they probably- know that when shooting down hill it is necessary to aim low. Such shooting as the English soldier is capable of may be very well when be has an army to aim at, but it is useless in guerilla warfare against a foe skilled in tbe use of tbe rifle and the art of taking shelter. A couple of months after tbe storming of Majuba, I, together with a friend, had a conversation with a Boer, a volunteer from the Free State in the late war, and one of the detachment that stormed Majuba, who gave us a circumstantial account of the attack with the greatest willingness. He said that when it was discovered that the English had possession of the mountain, they thought that the game was up, but after a while bolder counsels prevailed, and volun teers were called for to storm the bill. Only seventy men could be found to perform tbe duty, of whom be was one. They started up the mountain in fear and trembling, but soon found that every shot passed over tbeir heads, and went on with greater boldness. Only three men, he declared, were hit on the Boer side ; one was killed, one was bit in tbe arm, and he himself was the third, getting his face grazed by a bullet, of which he showed us tbe scar. He stated that the first to reach the top ridge was a boy of twelve, and that as soon as the troops saw them they fled, when, he said, he paid them out for having nearly killed him, knocking them over one after another \"like bucks \" as they ran down the hill, adding that it was"], [324, "THE TRANSVAAL. 240 \" alter lecker \" (very nice). He asked us \u25a0 how many men we had lost during tbe war, and when we told him about seven hundred killed and wounded, laughed in our faces, saying he knew that our dead amounted to several thousands. On our assuring him that this was not the case, be replied, \"Well, don't let's talk of it any more, because we are good friends now, and if we go on you will lie, and I shall lie, and then we shall get angry. The war is over now, and I don't want to quarrel with the English ; if one of them takes off his hat to me I always acknowledge it.\" He did not mean any harm in talking thus ; it is what Eng lishmen have to put up with now in South Africa ; the Boers have beaten us, and act accordingly. This man also told us that tbe majority of tbe rifles they picked up were sighted for 400 yards, whereas the latter part of tbe fighting had been carried on within 200. Sir George Colley's death was much lamented in the colony, where be was deservedly popular ; indeed, any body who bad the honour of knowing that kind-hearted English gentleman, could not do otherwise than deeply regret his untimely end. What bis motive was in oc cupying Majuba in the way he did has never, so far as I am aw-are, transpired. The move, in itself, would have been an excellent one, had it been made in force, or accompanied by a direct attack on tbe Nek, but, as undertaken, seems to have been objectless. There were, of course, many rumours as to tbe motives that prompted his action, of which tbe most probable seems to be that, being aware of what the Home Government intended to do with reference to tbe Transvaal, he de termined to strike a blow to try and establish British"], [325, "THE BOER REBELLION. 241 supremacy first, knowing how mischievous any ap parent surrender would be. Whatever his faults may have been as a General, be was a brave man, and had the honour of his country much at heart. It was also said by soldiers who saw him the night the troops marched up Majuba, that tbe General was \" not himself,\" and it was hinted that continual anxiety and tbe chagrin of failure bad told upon his mind. As against this, however, must be set the fact that his telegrams to the Secretary of State for War, the last of which be must have despatched only about half an hour before he was shot, are cool and collected, and written in the same unconcerned tone \u2014 as though he were a critical spectator of an interesting scene \u2014 that characterises all bis communications, more espe cially his despatches. They at* any rate give no evi dence of shaken nerve or unduly excited brain, nor can I see that any action of bis with reference to the occupation of Majuba is out of keeping with the details of his generalship upon other occasions. He was always confident to rashness, and possessed by the idea that every man in the ranks was full of as high a spirit, and as brave as he was himself. In deed, most people will think, that so far from its being a rasher action, the occupation of Majuba, bad generalship as it seems, was a wiser move than either the attack on the Nek or the Ingogo fiasco. But at the best, all bis movements are difficult to be understood by a civilian, though they may, for ought we know, have been part of an elaborate plan, perfected in accordance with the rules of military science, of which, it is said, he was a great student. q"], [326, "242 CHABTEB VI. THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. When Parliament met in January 1881, the Govern ment announced, through the mediumship of the Queen's Speech, that it was tbeir intention to vin dicate Her Majesty's authority iu tbe Transvaal. I have already briefly described tbe somewhat unfor tunate attempts to gain this end by force of arms ; and I now propose to follow tbe course of the diplo matic negotiations entered into by tbe ministry with the same object. As soon as the hostilities in tbe Transvaal took a positive form, causing great dismay among tbe Home authorities, whose paths, as we all know, are tbe paths of peace \u2014 at any price ; and whilst, in tbe first confusion of calamity, they knew not where to turn, President Brand stepped upon tbe scene in tbe character of \" Our Mutual Friend,\" and, by tbe Govern ment at any rate, was rapturously welcomed. This gentleman has for many years been at tbe bead of tbe Government of tbe Orange Free State, whose fortunes be had directed with considerable ability. He is a man of natural talent and kind-bearted dis position, and has the advancement of the Boer cause in South Africa much at heart. Tbe rising in the"], [327, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 243 Transvaal was an event that gave him a great and threefold opportunity: first, of interfering with tbe genuinely benevolent object of checking bloodshed ; secondly, of advancing the Dutch cause throughout South Africa under tbe cloak of amiable neutrality, and striking a dangerous blow at British supremacy over the Dutch and British prestige with the natives ; and, thirdly, of putting the English Government under a lasting obligation to him. Of this oppor tunity he has availed himself to the utmost in each particular. So soon as things began to look serious, Mr. Brand put himself into active telegraphic communication with the various British authorities with tbe view of pre venting bloodshed by inducing the English Govern ment to accede to the Boer demands. He was also earnest in his declarations that the Free State was not supporting the Transvaal ; which, considering that it was practically the insurgent base of supplies, where they had retired their women, children, and cattle, and that it furnished them with a large number of volun teers, was perhaps straining the truth. About this time also we find Lord Kimberley tele graphing to Mr. Brand that \"if only the Transvaal Boers will desist from armed opposition to the Queen's authority,\" he thinks some arrangement might be made. This is the first indication made public of what was passing in the minds of Her Majesty's Government, on whom its Badical supporters were now beginning to put the screw, to induce or threaten them into sub mitting to the Boer demands. Again, on the 1 ith January, the Bresident tele graphed to Lord Kimberley through the Orange Free"], [328, "THE TRANSVAAL. 244 State Consul in London, suggesting that Sir H. de Villiers, the Chief Justice at the Cape, should be ap pointed a Commissioner to go to tbe Transvaal to settle matters. Oddly enough, about tbe same time the same proposition emanated from tbe Dutch party in the Cape Colony, beaded by Mr. Hofmeyer, a coincidence that inclines one to the opinion that these friends of the Boers had some further reason for thus urging Sir Henry de Villiers' appointment as Commissioner beyond bis apparent fitness for the post, of which his high reputation as a lawyer and in his private capacity was a sufficient guarantee. The explanation is not bard to find, the fact being that, rightly or wrongly, Sir Henry de Villiers, who is himself of Dutch descent, is noted throughout South Africa for bis sympathies with the Boer cause, and both Bresident Brand and tbe Dutch party in tbe Cape shrewdly suspected that, if tbe settling of dif ferences were left to bis discretion, the Boers and tbeir interests would receive very gentle handling. Tbe course of action adopted by him, when be be came a member of the Boyal Commission, went far to support this view, for it will be noticed in the Beport of the Commissioners that in every single point be appears to have taken the Boer side of the contention. Indeed so blind was he to tbeir faults, that he would not even admit that the horrible Potchefstroom murders and atrocities, which are con demned both by Sir H. Bobinson and Sir Evelyn Wood in language as strong as the formal terms of a report will allow, were acts contrary to tbe rules of civilised warfare. If those acts had been perpe trated by Englishmen on Boers, or even on natives,"], [329, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 245 I venture to tbink Sir Henry de Villiers would have looked at them in a very different light. In the same telegram in which President Brand recommends the appointment of Sir Henry de Villiers, he states that the allegations made by the Triumvirate in the proclamation in which they accused Sir Owen Lanyon of committing various atrocities, deserve to be investigated, as they maintain that the collision was commenced by the authorities. Nobody knew better than Mr. Brand that any English official would be quite incapable of the conduct ascribed to Sir Owen Lanyon, whilst, even if the collision had been com menced by the authorities, which as it happened it was not, they would under tbe circumstances have been amply justified in so commencing it. This re mark by President Brand in his telegram was merely an attempt to throw an air of probability over a series of slanderous falsehoods. Messages of this nature continued to pour along the wires from day to day, but the tone of those from the Colonial Office grew gradually humbler. Thus we find Lord Kimberley telegraphing on the 8 th February, that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition all reasonable guarantees would be given as to tbeir treatment after submission, and that a scheme would be framed for the \"permanent friendly settlement of difficulties.\" It will be seen that tbe Government bad already begun to water the meaning of their declara tion that they would vindicate Her Majesty's autho rity. No doubt Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Courtney, and their followers bad given another turn to the Badical screw. It is, however, clear that at this time no idea of"], [330, "246 THE TRANSVAAL. the real aims of the Government bad entered into the mind of Sir George Colley, since on the 7th Feb ruary be telegraphed borne a plan which be proposed to adopt on entering the Transvaal, wbicb included a suggestion that he should grant a complete amnesty only to those Boers who would sign a declaration of loyalty. In answer to this he was ordered to do nothing of tbe sort, but to promise protection to everybody and refer everything home. Then came the battle of Ingogo, which checked for the time the flow of telegrams, or rather varied tbeir nature, for those despatched during the next few days deal with the question of reinforcements. On tbe 13th February, however, negotiations were reopened by Baul Kruger, one of the Triumvirate, who offered, if all the troops were ordered to withdraw from tbe Transvaal, to give them a free passage through tbe Nek, to disperse the Boers, and to consent to tbe appointment of a Commission. Tbe offer was jumped at by Lord Kimberley, who, without making reference to the question of with drawing the soldiers, offered, if only the Boers would disperse, to appoint a Commission with extensive powers to develop the \" permanent friendly settle ment \" scheme. The telegram ends thus : \" Add, that if this proposal is accepted, you now are authorised to agree to suspension of hostilities on our part.\" This message was sent to General Wood, because tbe Boers had stopped the' communications with Colley-. On the 19th, Sir George Colley replies in these words, which show bis astonishment at the policy adopted by the Home Government, and which,"], [331, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 247 in the opinion of most people, redound to bis credit \u2014 \u25a0 \" Latter part of your telegram to Wood not under stood. There can be no hostilities if no resistance is made, but am I to leave Lang's Nek in Natal territory in Boer occupation, and our garrisons isolated and short of provisions, or occupy former and relieve latter?\" Lord Kimberley hastens to reply that the garrisons must be left free to provision themselves, \"but we do not mean that you should march to .the relief of garrisons or occupy Lang's Nek if an arrangement proceeds.\" It will be seen that the definition of what vindica tion of Her Majesty's authority consisted grew broader and broader; it now included the right of the Boers to continue to occupy their positions in tbe colony of Natal. Meanwhile the daily fire of complimentary messages was being kept up between President Brand and Lord Kimberley, who alternately gave \" sincere thanks to Lord Kimberley \" and \" fully appreciated the friendly spirit\" of Bresident Brand, till on tbe 21st February the latter telegraphs through Colley : \" Hope of amic able settlement by negotiation, but this will be greatly facilitated if somebody on spot and friendly disposed to both could by personal communication with both endeavour to smooth difficulties. Offers his services to Her Majesty's Government, and Kruger and Fre torius and Joubert are willing.\" Needless to say bis services were accepted. Bresently, however, on 27th February, Sir George Colley made his last move, and took possession of Majuba. His defeat and death had the effect of causing"], [332, "THE TRANSVAAL. 248 another temporary check in tbe peace negotiations, whilst Sir Frederick Boberts with ample reinforcements was despatched to Natal. It had the further effect of increasing the haughtiness of the Boer leaders, and infusing a corresponding spirit of pliability or gene rosity into the negotiations of Her Majesty's Govern ment. Thus on 2d March, the Boers, through Bresident Brand and Sir Evelyn Wood, inform the Secretary of State for the Colonies that they are willing to negotiate, but decline to submit or cease opposition. Sir Evelyn Wood, who evidently did not at all like the line of policy adopted by the Government, telegraphed that be thought the best thing to do w-ould be for him to engage the Boers, and disperse them vi et armis, with out any guarantees, \" considering tbe disasters we have sustained,\" and that he should, \" if absolutely neces sary,\" be empowered to promise life and property to the leaders, but that they should be banished from the country. In answer to this telegram, Lord Kimberley informs bim that Her Majesty's Government will am nesty everybody except those who have committed acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare, and that they will agree to anything, and appoint a Commission to carry out the details, and \" be ready for friendby com munications with any persons appointed by the Boers.\" Thus was Her Majesty's authority finally re-estab lished in the Transvaal. It was not a very grand climax, nor the kind of arrangement to which Englishmen are accustomed, but perhaps, considering the circumstances, and the well known predilections of those who made tbe settlement, it was as much as could be expected."], [333, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 249 The action of the Government must not be considered as though they were unfettered in their judgment; it can never be supposed that they acted as they did because they thought such action right or even wise, for that would be to set them down as men of a very low order of intelligence, which they certainly are not. It is clear that no set of sensible men, who had after much consideration given tbeir decision that under all tbe circumstances the Transvaal must remain British territory, and who, on a revolt subsequently breaking out in that territory, bad declared that Her Majesty's rule must be upheld, would have, putting aside all other circumstances, deliberately stultified themselves by almost unconditionally, and of tbeir own free will, abandoning tbe country, and all Her Majesty's subjects living in it. That would be to pay a poor tribute to their understanding, since it is clear that if reasons existed for retaining the Transvaal before the war, as they were satisfied there did, those reasons would exist with still greater force after a war had been under taken and three crushing defeats sustained, which if left unavenged must, as they knew, have a most disastrous effect on our prestige throughout the South African continent. I prefer to believe that the Government was coerced into acting as it did by Badical pressure, both from outside and from its immediate supporters in the House, and that it had to choose between making an unconditional surrender in tbe Transvaal and losing the support of a very powerful party. Under these circumstances it, being Liberal in politics, naturally followed its instincts, and chose surrender."], [334, "THE TRANSVAAL. 250 If such a policy was bad in itself, and necessarily mischievous in its consequences, so much the worse for those who suffered by it ; it was clear that the Government could not be expected to lose votes in order to forward the true interests of countries so far off as the South African Colonies, which had had tbe misfortune to be made a party question of, and must take the consequences. There is no doubt that the interest brought to bear on the Government was very considerable, for not only bad they to deal with their own supporters, and with the shadowy caucus that was ready to let tbe lash of its displeasure descend even on tbe august person of Mr. Gladstone, should he show signs of letting slip so rich an opportunity for the vindication of tbe holiest principles of advanced Badicalism, but also with tbe hydra-headed crowd of visionaries and professional sentimentalists who swarm in this country, and who are always ready to take up any cause, from that of Jumbo or of a murderer to that of oppressed peoples, such as the Bulgarians or the Transvaal Boers. These gentlemen, burning with zeal, and filled with that confidence which proverbially results from tbe hasty assimilation of imperfect and erroneous informa tion, found in the Transvaal question a great oppor tunity of making a noise ; and \u2014 as in a disturbed farmyard the bray of the domestic donkey, ringing loud, and clear among the utterances of more intelli gent animals, overwhelms and extinguishes them \u2014 so, and with like effect, amongst the confused sound of various English opinions about tbe Boer rising, rose the trumpet-note of the Transvaal Independence Com mittee and its supporters."], [335, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 251 As we have seen, they did not sound in vain. On the 6th of March an armistice with tbe Boers had been entered into by Sir Evelyn Wood, which was several times prolonged up to the 21st March, when Sir Evelyn Wood concluded a preliminary peace with the Boer leaders, which, under certain conditions, guaranteed tbe restoration of the country within six months, and left all other points to be decided by a Boyal Commission. Tbe news of this peace was at first received in tbe colony in the silence of astonishment. Personally, I remember, I would not believe that it was true. It seemed to us, who bad been witnesses of what had passed, and knew what it all meant, something so utterly incredible that we thought there must be a mistake. If there had been any one redeeming circumstanoe about it, if the English arms bad gained a single decisive victory, it might have been so, but it was bard for Englishmen, just at first, to understand that not only bad the Transvaal been to all appearance wrested from them by force of arms, but that they were henceforth to be subject, as they well knew would be the case, to tbe coarse insults of victorious Boers, aud the sarcasms of keener-witted Kafirs. Beople in England seem to fancy that when men go to the colonies they lose all sense of pride in their country, and think of nothing but their own advantage. I do not think that this is the case, indeed, I believe that, individual for individual, there exists a greater sense of loyalty, and a deeper pride in tbeir nationality, and in the proud name of England, among colonists, than among Englishmen proper. Certainly tbe bumili-"], [336, "THE TRANSVAAL. 252 ation of tbe Transvaal surrender was more keenly felt in South Africa than it was at home; but, perhaps, the impossibility of imposing upon people in that country with the farrago of nonsense about blood guiltiness and national morality, which was made such adroit use of at home, may have made tbe dif ference. I know that personally I would not have believed it possible that I could feel any public event so keenly as I did this ; indeed, I quickly made up my mind that if the peace was confirmed, the neighbour hood of the Transvaal would be no fit or comfortable residence for an Englishman, and that I would, at any cost, leave the country, \u2014 which I accordingly did. Newcastle was a curious sight the night after the peace was declared. Every hotel and bar was crowded with refugees, who were trying to relieve their feel ings by cursing the name of Gladstone with a vigour, originality, and earnestness that I have never heard equalled; and declaring in ironical terms how proud they were to be citizens of England \u2014 a country that always kept its word. Then they set to work with many demonstrations of contempt to burn the effigy of the Bight Honourable Gentleman at the bead of Her Majesty's Government, an example, by tbe way, that was followed throughout South Africa. Even Sir Evelyn Wood, who is very popular in the colony, was hissed as he walked through the town, and great surprise was expressed that a soldier who came out expressly to fight the Boers should consent to become the medium of communication in such a dirty business. And, indeed, there was some excuse"], [337, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 253 for all this bitterness, for tbe news meant ruin to very many. But if people in Natal and at tbe Cape received the news with astonishment, bow shall I describe its effect upon the unfortunate loyal inhabitants in the Transvaal, on whom it burst like a thunderbolt ? They did not say much, however, and indeed there was nothing to be said. They simply began to pack up such things as they could carry with them, and to leave the country, which they well knew would henceforth be utterly untenable for Englishmen or English sym pathisers. In a few weeks they come pouring down through Newcastle by hundreds ; it was tbe most melancholy exodus that can be imagined. There were people of all classes, officials, gentlefolk, work-people, and loyal Boers, but they had a connecting link ; they bad all been loyal, and they were all ruined. Most of these people had gone to the Transvaal since it became a British colony, and invested all they had in it, and now their capital was lost and their labour rendered abortive ; indeed, many of them whom one bad known as well to do in the Transvaal, came down to Natal hardly knowing how they would feed tbeir families next week. It must be understood that so soon as the Queen's sovereignty was withdrawn the value of landed and house property in the Transvaal went down to nothing, and has remained there ever since. Thus a fair-sized house in Bretoria brought in a rental varying from ten to twenty pounds a month during British occupation, but after the declaration of peace, owners of bouses were glad to get people to live in them to keep them from falling into ruin. Those, who owned land or had"], [338, "THE TRANSVAAL. 254 invested money in businesses suffered in tbe same way ; their property remains neither profitable or saleable, and they themselves are precluded by their nationality from living on it, the art of \"Boycotting\" not being peculiar to Ireland. Nor w-ere they tbe only sufferers. The officials, many of whom had taken to the Government service as a permanent profession, in which they expected to pass their lives, were suddenly dismissed, mostly with a small gratuity, which w-ould about suffice to pay their debts, and told to find their living as best they could. It was indeed a case of vae victis, \u2014 woe to tbe conquered loyalists.1 Tbe Commission appointed by Her Majesty's Govern ment consisted of Sir Hercules Bobinson, Sir Henry de Villiers, and Sir Evelyn Wood, Bresident Brand being also present in bis capacity of friend of both parties, and to their discretion were left the settlement of all outstanding questions. Amongst these, were the mode of trial of those persons who had been guilty of acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare, the question 1 The following extract is clipped from a recent issue of the Trans vaal Advertiser. It describes the present condition of Pretoria : \u2014 \"The streets grown over with rank vegetation; the water-furrows uncleaned and unattended, emitting offensive and unhealthy stenches ; the houses showing evident signs of dilapidation and decay ; the side paths, in many places, dangerous to pedestrians \u2014 in fact, everything the eye can rest upon indicates the downfall which has overtaken this once prosperous city. The visitor can, if he be so minded, betake him self to the outskirts and suburbs, where he will perceive the same sad evidences of neglect, public grounds unattended, roads uncared for, mills and other public works crumbling into ruin. These palpable signs of decay most strongly impress him. A blight seems to have come over this lately fair and prosperous town. Rapidly it is becoming a 'deserted village,' a 'city of the dead.' \""], [339, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 255 of severance of territory from tbe Transvaal on the eastern boundary, the settlement of the boundary in the Keate- Award districts, the compensation for losses sustained during the war, the functions of the British Besident, and other matters. Their place of meeting was at Newcastle in Natal, and from thence they pro ceeded to Pretoria. The first question of importance that came before the Commission was the mode of trial to be adopted in tbe cases of those persons accused of acts contrary to the usages of civilised warfare, such as murder. The Attorney-General for the Transvaal strongly ad vised that a special tribunal should be constituted to try these cases, principally because \" after a civil war in which all tbe inhabitants of a country, with very few exceptions, have taken part, a jury of fair and impartial men, truly unbiassed, will be very difficult to get together.\" It is satisfactory to know that the Commissioners gave this somewhat obvious fact \" their grave consideration,\" which, according to their Beport, resulted in their determining to let the cases go before the ordinary court, and be tried by a jury, because in referring them to a specially constituted court which would have done equal justice without fear or favour, \" the British Government w-ould have made for itself, among the Dutch population of South Africa, a name for vindictive oppression, which no generosity in other affairs could efface.\" There is more in this determination of the Commis sioners, or rather of the majority of them \u2014 for Sir E. Wood, to his credit be it said, refused to agree in their decision \u2014 than meets the eye, the fact of the matter being that it was privately well known to them, that,"], [340, "THE TRANSVAAL. 256 though the Boer leaders might be willing to allow a few of the murderers to undergo the form of a trial, neither they nor tbe Boers themselves meant to permit the farce to go any further. Had tbe men been tried by a special tribunal they would in all probability have been condemned to death, and then would have come the awkward question of carrying out the sentence on individuals whose deeds were looked on, if not with general approval, at any rate without aversion by the great mass of tbeir countrymen. In short, it would probably have become necessary either to reprieve them or to fight the Boers again, since it was very certain that they would not have allowed them to be hung. Therefore the majority of tbe Commissioners, finding themselves face to face with a dead wall, determined to slip round it instead of boldly climbing it, by referring the cases to tbe Transvaal High Court, cheerfully con fident of what tbe result must be. After all, the matter was, much cry about little wool, for of all the crimes committed by the Boers \u2014 a list of some of which will be found in the Appendix to this book \u2014 in only three cases were a proportion of the perpetrators produced and put through tbe form of trial. Those three were \u2014 tbe dastardly murder of Cap tain Elliot, who was shot by his Boer escort whilst crossing the Vaal river on parole ; the murder of a man named Malcolm, who was kicked to death in his own bouse by Boers, who afterwards put a bullet through bis head to make the job \"look better;\" and tbe murder of a doctor named Barber, who was shot by his escort on the border of the Free State. A few of the men concerned in the first two of these crimes were tried in Pretoria; and it was currently reported"], [341, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 257 at that time, that in order to make their acquittal certain our Attorney-General received instructions not to exercise his right of challenging jurors on behalf of the Crown. Whether or not this is true I am not prepared to say, but I believe it is a fact that be did not exercise that right, though the counsel for the prisoners availed themselves of it freely, with the result that in Elliot's case, the jury was composed of eight Boers and one German, nine being the full South African jury. Tbe necessary result followed ; in both cases the prisoners were acquitted in tbe teeth of the evidence. Barber's murderers were tried in the Free State, and were, as might be expected, acquitted. Thus it will be seen that of all tbe perpetrators of murder and other crimes during the course of tbe war not one was brought to justice. The offence for which their victims died was, in nearly every case, that they had served, were serving, or were loyal to Her Majesty the Queen. In no single case has England exacted retribution for the murder of her servants and citizens ; but nobody can read through the long list of these dastardly slaughters without feeling that they will not go unavenged. The innocent blood that has been shed on behalf of this country, and the tears of children and widows, now appeal to a higher tribunal than that of Mr. Glad stone's Government, and assuredly they will not appeal in vain. Tbe next point of importance dealt with by the Commission was the question whether or no any territory should be severed from the Transvaal, and kept under English rule for the benefit of the native inhabitants. Lord Kimberley, acting under pressure R"], [342, "258 THE TRANSVAAL. put upon bim by members of the Aborigines Protection Society, instructed the Commission to consider the advisability of severing the districts of Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg, and also a strip of territory bordering on Zululand and Swaziland, from tbe Transvaal, so as to place the inhabitants of the first two districts out of danger of maltreatment by tbe Boers, and to interpose a buffer between Zulus, and Swazis, and Boer atro-ression, and vice versa. The Boer leaders had, it must be remembered, ac quiesced in the principle of such a separation in tbe preliminary peace signed by Sir Evelyn Wood and themselves. The majority of the Commission, however (Sir Evelyn Wood dissenting), finally decided against the retention of either of these districts, a decision which, I think,, was a wise one, though I arrive at that conclusion on very different grounds to those adopted by the majority of the Commission. Personally, I cannot see that it is the duty of England to play policeman to the whole world. To have retained these native districts would have been to make ourselves responsible for tbeir good govern ment, and to have guaranteed them against Boer encroachment, which I do not think that we were called upon to do. It is surely not incumbent upon us,* having given up the Transvaal to tbe Boers, to undertake the management of the most troublesome part of it, the Zulu border. Besides, bad as the abandonment of the Transvaal is, I think that if it was to be done at all, it was best to do it thoroughly, since to have kept some natives under our protection, and to have handed over the rest to the tender mercies of the Boers, would only be to"], [343, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 259 render our injustice more obvious, whilst weakening the power of the natives themselves to combine in self-defence, since those under our protection would naturally have little sympathy with their more un fortunate brethren \u2014 their interests and circumstances being different. The Commission do not seem to have considered the question from these points of view ; but putting them on one side, there are many other considerations con- nected with it which are ably summed up in their Beport. Amongst these is the danger of disturb- ances commenced between Zulus or Swazis and Boers spreading into Natal, and the probability of tbe fomenting of disturbances amongst tbe Zulus by Boers. The great argument for the retention of some territory, if only as a symbol that the English had not been driven out of the country, is, however, set forth in the forty-sixth paragraph of the Beport, which runs as follows : \u2014 \" The moral considerations that determine the actions of \u25a0 civilised governments are not easily understood by barbarians, in whose eyes successful force is alone the sign of superiority, and it appeared possible that the surrender by the British Crown of one of its possessions to those who had been in arms against it, might be looked upon by the natives in no other way than as a token of the defeat and decay of the British power, and that thus a serious shock might be given to British authority in South Africa, and the capacity of Great Britain to govern and direct the vast native popula tion within and without her South African dominions \u25a0a capacity resting largely on the renown of her name \u2022might be dangerously impaired.\""], [344, "260 THE TRANSVAAL. These words, coming from so unexpected a source, do not, though couched in such mild language, hide the startling importance of the question discussed. On tbe contrary, they accurately and with double weight convey the sense and gist of the most damning argument against the policy of the retrocession of the Transvaal in its entirety ; and proceeding from their own carefully chosen Commissioners, can hardly have been pleasant reading to Lord Kimberley and his col leagues. Tbe majority of the Commission then proceeds to set forth the arguments advanced by the Boers against the retention of any territory, which appear to have been chiefly of a sentimental character, since we are informed that \"the people, it seemed certain, would not have valued the restoration of a mutilated country. Sentiment in a great measure had led them to insur rection, and the force of such it was impossible to dis regard.\" Sir Evelyn Wood, in his dissent, states that he cannot even agree with the premises of his colleagues' argument, since he is convinced that it was not senti ment that had led to the outbreak, but a \" general and rooted aversion to taxation.\" If he had added, and a hatred not only of English rule, but of all rule, he would have stated the complete cause of the Transvaal rebellion. In the next paragraph of the Beport, how ever, we find the real cause of the pliability of the Commission in the matter, which is tbe same that influenced them in their decision about the mode of trial of tbe murderers and other questions \u2014 they feared that the people would appeal to arms if they decided against their wishes. Discreditable and disgraceful as it may seem, nobody"], [345, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 261 can read this Beport without plainly seeing that the Commissioners were, in treating with the Boers on these points, in the position of ambassadors from a beaten people getting the best terms they could. Of course, they well knew that this was not the case, but whatever the Boer leaders may have said, the Boers themselves did not know this, or even pretend to look at the matter in any other light. When we asked for the country back, said they, we did not get it ; after we had three times defeated tbe English we did get it ; the logical conclusion from the facts being that we got it because we defeated the English. This was their tone, and it is not therefore surprising that whenever the Commission threatened to decide any thing against them, they, with a smile, let it know that if it did, they would be under the painful necessity of re-occupying Lang's Nek. It was never necessary to repeat the threat, since the majority of the Com mission would thereupon speedily find a way to meet the views of the Boer representatives. Sir Evelyn Wood, in his dissent, thus correctly sums up the matter : \u2014 \" To contend that the Boyal Commission ought not to decide contrary to the wishes of the Boers, because such decision might not be accepted, is to deny to the Commission the very power of decision that it was agreed should be left in its hands.\" Exactly so. But it is evident that the Com mission knew its place, and so far from attempting to exercise any \" power of decision,\" it was quite content with such concessions as it could obtain by means of bargaining. Thus, as an additional reason against the retention of any territory, it is urged that if this territory was retained \" the majority of your Commis-"], [346, "THE TRANSVAAL. 262 sioners . . . would have found themselves in no favour able position for obtaining the concurrence of the Boer leaders as to other matters.\" In fact, Her Majesty's Commission, appointed, or supposed to be appointed, to do Her Majesty's will and pleasure, shook in its shoes before men who had lately been rebels in arms against her authority, and humbly submitted itself to their dicta. The majority of the Commission went on to express their opinion, that by giving way about the retention of territory they would be able to obtain better terms for the natives generally, and larger powers for the British Besident. But, as Sir Evelyn Wood points out in his Beport, they did nothing of the sort, the terms of the agreement about the Besident and other native matters being all consequent on and included in the first agreement of peace. Besides, they seem to have overlooked the fact that such concessions as they did obtain are only on paper, and practically worthless, whilst all bond fide advantages remained with the Boers. The decision of the Commissioners in the question of the Keate Award, which next came under their consideration, appears to have been a judicious one, being founded on the very careful Beport of Colonel Moysey, B.E., who had been for many months collect ing information on the spot. The Keate Award Terri tory is a region lying to the south-west of the Transvaal, and was, like many other districts in that country, originally in the possession of natives of the Baralong and Batlapin tribes. Individual Boers having, however, more suo taken possession of tracts of land in the dis trict, difficulties speedily arose between tbeir Govern-"], [347, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 263 ment and the native chiefs, and in 1871 Mr. Keate, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, was by mutual consent called in to arbitrate on the matter. His decision was entirely in favour of the natives, and was accordingly promptly and characteristically repudiated by the Boer Volksraad. From that time till the rebellion the ques tion remained unsettled, and was indeed a very thorny one to deal with. The Commission, acting on the prin ciple in media tutissimus ibis, drew a line through the midst of the disputed territory, or, in other words, set aside Mr. Keate's award, and interpreted the dispute in favour of the Boers. This decision was accepted by all parties at the time, but it has not resulted in the maintenance of peace. The principal chief, Montsioa, is an old ally and staunch friend of the English, a fact which the Boers are not able to forget or forgive, and they appear to have stirred up rival chiefs to attack him, and to have allow-ed volunteers from the Transvaal to assist them. Montsioa has also enlisted some white volunteers, and several fights have taken place, in which the loss of life has been considerable. Whether or no the Transvaal Government is directly concerned it is impossible to say, but from the fact that cannon are said to have been used against Montsioa it would appear that it is, since private in dividuals do not, as a rule, own Armstrong guns.1 Amongst the questions remaining for the consider ation of the Commissioners was that of what com pensation should be given for losses during the war. 1 I beg to refer any reader interested in this matter to the letter of \"Transvaal\" to the Standard, which I have republished in the Appendix to this book."], [348, "THE TRANSVAAL. 264 Of course, the great bulk of the losses sustained were of an indirect nature, resulting from the necessary and enormous depreciation in the value of land and other property, consequent on the retrocession. Into this matter the Home Government declined to enter, thereby saving its pocket at the price of its honour, since it was upon English guarantees that the country would remain a British possession that the majority of the unfortunate loyals invested their money in it. It was, however, agreed by the Commission (Sir H. de Villiers dissenting) that the Boers should be liable for compensation in cases where loss had been sustained through commandeering seizure, confisca tion, destruction, or damage of property. The sums awarded under these heads have already amounted to about \u00a3110,000, which sum has been defrayed by the Imperial Government, the Boer authorities stating that they were not in a position to pay it. In connection with this matter I will pass to the financial clauses of the Beport. When the country was annexed, the public debt amounted to \u00a3301,727. Under British rule this debt was liquidated to the extent of -,\u00a3150,000, but tbe total was brought up by a Barliamentary grant, a loan from the Standard Bank, and sundries to \u00a3390,404, which represented the public debt of the Transvaal on the 31st December 1880. This was further increased by moneys advanced by tbe Standard Bank and English Exchequer during the war, and till the 8th August 1881, during which time the country yielded no revenue, to \u00a3\"457,393. To this must be added an estimated sum of \u00a3200,000 for compensation charges, pension allowances, &c, and a further sum of \u00a3383,000, the cost of the successful"], [349, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 265 expedition against Secoc\u0153ni, that of the unsuccessful one being left out of account, bringing up the total public debt to over a million, of which about \u00a3800,000 is owing to this country. This sum, with the characteristic liberality that distinguished them in their dealings with the Boers, but which was not so marked where loyals were con cerned, the Commissioners (Sir Evelyn Wood dissent ing) reduced by a stroke of the pen to .\u00a3265,000, thus entirely remitting an approximate sum of \u00a3 500,000, or \u00a3\"600,000. To the sum of \u00a3265,000 still owing must be added say another \u00a3150,000 for sums lately advanced to pay the compensation claims, bringing up the actual amount now owing to England to something under half a million, of which I say with confidence she will never see a single \u00a310,000. As this contingency was not contemplated, or if contem plated, not alluded to by the Boyal Commission, pro vision was made for a Sinking Fund, by means of which the debt, which is a second charge on the revenues of the States, is to be extinguished in twenty-five years. It is a strange instance of the proverbial irony of fate, that whilst the representatives of the Imperial Government were thus showering gifts of hundreds of thousands of pounds upon men who had spurned the benefits of Her Majesty's rule, made war upon her forces, and murdered her subjects, no such con sideration was extended to those who had remained loyal to her throne. Their claims for compensation were passed by unheeded ; and looking from the win dows of the room in which they sat in Newcastle, the members of the Commission might have seen"], [350, "THE TRANSVAAL. 266 them flocking down from a country that could no longer be their home ; those that were rich among them made poor, and those that were poor reduced to destitution. \u25a0 The only other point which it will be necessary for me to touch on in connection with this Beport is the duties of the British Besident and his rela tions to the natives. He was to be invested as repre sentative of the Suzerain with functions for securing the execution of the terms of peace as regards \u2014 (i) the control of the foreign relations of the State ; (2) the control of the frontier affairs of the State ; and (3) the protection of the interests of the natives in the State. As regards the first of these points, it was arranged that the interests of subjects of the Transvaal should be left in the hands of Her Majesty's representatives abroad. Since Boers are, of all people in the world, the most stay-at-home, our ambassadors and consuls are not likely to be troubled much on their account. With reference to the second point, the Commission made stipulations that would be admirable if there were any probability of their being acted up to. Tbe Besident is to report any encroachment on native territory by Boers to the High Commissioner, and when tbe Besident and the Boer Government differ, the decision of the Suzerain is to be final. This is a charming way of settling difficulties, but the Com mission forgets to specify how the Suzerain's decision is to be enforced. After what has happened, it can hardly have relied on awe of the name of England to bring about the desired obedience ! But besides thus using his beneficent authority to"], [351, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 267 prevent subjects of the Transvaal from trespassing on their neighbour's land, the Besident is to exercise a general supervision over .the interests of all the natives in the country. Considering that they number about a million, and are scattered over a territory larger than France, one would think that this duty alone would have taken up the time of any ordinary man ; and, indeed, Sir Evelyn Wood was in favour of the appoint ment of sub-residents to assist him. The majority of the Commission refused, however, to listen to any such suggestion \u2014 believing, they said, \" that the least possible interference with the independent Government of the State would be the wisest.\" Quite so, but I sup pose it never occurred to them to ask the natives what their views of the matter were ! The Besident was also to be a member of a Native Location Commission, which was at some future time to provide land for the natives to live on. In perusing this Beport it is easy to follow with more or less accuracy the individual bent of its framers. Sir Hercules Robinson figures throughout as a man who has got a disagreeable business -to carry out, in obedience to instructions that admit of no trifling with, and who has set himself to do the best be can for his country, and those who suffer through his country's policy, whilst obeying those instructions. He has evidently choked down his feelings and opinions as an individual, and turned himself into an official machine, merely registering in detail the will of Lord Kimberley. With Sir Henry de Villiers the case is very different. One feels throughout that the task is to him a congenial one, and that the Boer cause has in him an excellent"], [352, "THE TRANSVAAL. 268 friend. Indeed, had he been an advocate of their cause instead of a member of the Commission, he could not have espoused their side on every occa sion with greater zeal. According to him they were always in the right, and in them he could find no guile. Mr. Hofmeyer and Bresident Brand exercised a wise discretion from their own point of view when they urged his appointment as Special Com missioner. I now come to Sir Evelyn Wood, who was in the position of an independent Englishman, neither prejudiced in favour of the Boers, or the reverse, and on whom, as a military man, Lord Kimberley would find it difficult to put the official screw. The results of his happy position are obvious in the paper attached to the end of the Beport, and signed by him, in which he totally and entirely differs from the majority of the Commission on every point of any importance. Most people will think that this very outspoken and forcible dissent deducts somewhat from the value of the Beport, and throws a shadow of doubt on tbe wisdom of its pro visions. The formal document of agreement between Her Majesty's Government and the Boer leaders, com monly known as the Convention, was signed by both parties at Pretoria on the afternoon of tbe 3d August 1 88 1, in the same room in which, nearly four years before, the Annexation Proclamation was signed by Sir T. Shepstone. Whilst this business was being transacted in Govern ment House, a curious ceremony was going on just outside, and within sight of the windows. This was the ceremonious burial of the Union Jack, which was"], [353, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 269 followed to the grave by a crowd of about 2000 loyalists and native chiefs. On the outside of the coffin was written the word \" Besurgam,\" and an eloquent oration was delivered over the grave. Such demonstrations are, no doubt, foolish enough, but they are not entirely without political significance. But a more unpleasant duty awaited the Commis sioners than that of attaching their signatures to a document, \u2014 consisting of the necessity of conveying Her Majesty's decision as to the retrocession to about a hundred native chiefs, until now Her Majesty's sub jects, who had been gathered together to hear it. It must be borne in mind that the natives had not been consulted as to tbe disposal of the country, although they outnumber the white people in the proportion of twenty to one, and that, beyond some worthless paper stipulations, nothing had been done for their interests. Personally, I must plead guilty to what I know is by many, especially by those who are attached to the Boer cause, considered as folly, if not worse, namely, a sufficient interest in the natives, and sympathy with tbeir sufferings, to bring me to the conclusion that in acting thus we have inflicted a cruel injustice upon them. It seems to me, that as they were the original owners of the soil, they were entitled to some consideration in the question of its disposal, and consequently and incidentally, of their own. I am aware that it is generally considered that the white man has a right to the black man's possessions and land, and that it is his high and holy mission to exterminate tbe wretched native and take his place. But with this conclusion I venture to"], [354, "THE TRANSVAAL. 270 differ. So far as my own experience of natives has gone, I have found that in all the essential qualities of mind and body they very much resemble white men, with the exception that they are, as a race, quicker-witted, more honest, and braver than the ordinary run of white men. Of them might be aptly quoted the speech Shakespeare puts into Shylock's mouth : \" Hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, pas- sions ? \" In the same way I ask, Has a native no feelings or affections ? does he not suffer when his parents are shot, or bis children stolen, or when he is driven a wanderer from his home ? Does he not know fear, feel pain, affection, hate, and gratitude ? Most certainly he does; and this being so, I cannot believe that the Almighty, who made both white and black, gave to the one race the right or mission of exterminating or even of robbing or maltreating the other, and calling the process the advance of civilisation. It seems to me, that on only one con- dition, if at all, have we the right to take the black men's land; and that is, that we provide them with an equal and a just Government, and allow no mal treatment of them, either as individuals or tribes, but, on the contrary, do our best to elevate them, and wean them from savage customs. Otherwise, the practice is surely undefensible. I am aware, however, that with the exception of a small class, these are sentiments which are not shared by tbe great majority of tbe public, either at home or abroad. Indeed, it can be plainly seen how little sympathy they command, from the fact that but scanty remonstrance was raised at the treatment meted out"], [355, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 271 to our native subjects in the Transvaal, when they were, to the number of nearly a million, handed over from the peace, justice, and security that on the whole characterise our rule, to a state of things and possi bilities of wrong and suffering which I will not try to describe. To the chiefs thus assembled Sir Hercules Bobinson, as President of the Boyal Commission, read a state ment, and then retired, refusing to allow them to speak in answer. The statement informed the natives that \" Her Majesty's Government, with that sense of justice which befits a great and powerful nation,\" had returned the country to the Boers, \" whose representatives, Messrs. Kruger, Pretorius, and Joubert, I now,\" said Sir Hercules, \" have much pleasure in introducing to y-ou.\" If reports are true, the native chiefs had, many of them personally, and all of them by reputa tion, already the advantage of a very intimate acquaint ance with all three of these gentlemen, so that an introduction was somewhat superfluous. Sir Hercules then went on to explain to them that locations would be allotted to them at some future time ; that a British Besident would be appointed, whose especial charge they would be, but that they must bear in mind that he was not ruler of the country, but the Government, \"subject to Her Majesty's suzerain rights.\" Natives were, no doubt, expected to know by intuition what suzerain rights are. Tbe state ment then goes on to give them good advice as to the advantages of indulging in manual labour when asked to do so by the Boers, and generally to show them how bright and happy is the future that lies before them. Lest they should be too elated by such good tidings,"], [356, "THE TRANSVAAL. 272 they are, however, reminded that it will be necessary to retain the law relating to passes, which is, in the hands of a people like the Boers, about as unjust a regulation as a dominant race can invent for the oppression of a subject people, and had, in the old days of the Republic, been productive of much hard ship. The statement winds up by assuring them that their \" interests will never be forgotten or neglected by Her Majesty's Government.\" Having read the document tbe Commission hastily withdrew, and after their withdrawal the chiefs were \"allowed\" to state tbeir opinions to the Secretary for Native Affairs. In availing themselves of this permission, it is notice able that no allusion was made to all the advantages they were to reap under the Convention, nor did they seem to attach much importance to the appointment of the British Besident. On the contrary, all their attention was given to the great fact that the country had been ceded to the Boers, and that they were no longer the Queen's subjects. We are told, in Mr. Shepstone's Beport, that they \" got very excited,\" and \" asked whether it was thought that they had no feelings or hearts, that they were thus treated as a stick or piece of tobacco, which could be passed from hand to band without question.\" Umgombarie, a Zoutpansberg chief, said : \" I am Umgombarie. I have fought with the Boers, and have many wounds, and they know that what I say is true. ... I will never consent to place myself under their rule. I belong to the English Government. I am not a man who eats with both sides of his jaw at once; I only use one side. I am English, I have said.\" Silamba said : \" I belong to the English. I will never return under"], [357, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 273 the Boers. You see me, a man of my rank and posi tion, is it right that such as I should be seized and laid on the ground and flogged, as has been done to me and other chiefs ? \" Sinkanhla said : \" We hear and yet do not hear, we cannot understand. We are troubling you, Chief, by talking in this way ; we hear the chiefs say that the Queen took tbe country because the people of the country wished it, and again that the majority of the owners of the country did not wish their rule, and that therefore the country was given back. We should like to have the man pointed out from among us black people who objects to the rule of the Queen. We are the real owners of the country; we were here when the Boers came, and without asking leave, settled down and treated us in every way badly. The English Government then came and took tbe country ; we have now bad four years of rest and peaceful and just rule. We have been called here to-day, and are told that the country, our country, has been given to the Boers by the Queen. This is a thing which surprises us. Did the country, then, belong to the Boers ? Did it not belong to our fathers and forefathers beforj us, long before the Boers came here ? We have heard that the Boers' country is at the Cape. If the Queen wishes to give them their land, why does she not give them back the Cape ? \" I have quoted this speech at length, because, although made by a despised native, it sets forth their case more powerfully and in happier language than I can do.

Our hearts are s"], [358, "THE TRANSVAAL. 274 black and heavy with grief to-day at the news told us, we are in agony, our intestines are twisting and writhing inside of us, just as you see a snake do when it is struck on the head. . . . We do not know what has become of us, but we feel dead; it may be that the Lord may change the nature of the Boers, and that we will not be treated like dogs and beasts of burden as formerly, but we have no hope of such a change, and we leave you with heavy hearts and great appre hension as to the future.\" In his Beport, Mr. Shep stone (tbe Secretary for Native Affairs) says : \" One chief, Jan Sibilo, who has been, he informed me, personally threatened with death by the Boers after the English leave, could not restrain bis feelings, but cried like a child.\" I have nothing to add to these extracts, which are taken from many such statements. They are the very words of the persons most concerned, and will speak for themselves. The Convention was signed on the 3d August 1881, and was to be formally ratified by a Volksraad or Parliament of the Burghers within three months of that date, in default of which it was to fall to the \"round and become null and void. Anybody who has followed the course of affairs with reference to the retrocession of the Transvaal, or who has even taken the trouble to read through this brief history, will probably come to tbe conclusion that, under all the circumstances, the Boers had got more than they could reasonably expect. Not so, however, the Boers themselves. On tbe 28th Sep tember tbe newly-elected Volksraad referred the Con vention to a General Committee to report on, and on"], [359, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 275 the 30th September the Beport was presented. On the 3d October a telegram was despatched through the British Besident to \" His Excellency W. E. Gladstone,\" in which the Volksraad states that the Convention is not acceptable \u2014 (1.) Because it is in conflict with the Sand Biver Treaty of 1852. (2.) Because it violates the peace agreement entered into with Sir Evelyn Wool, in confidence of which the Boers laid down their arms. The Volksraad consequently declared that modifica tions were desirable, and that certain articles must be altered. To begin with, they declare that the \" conduct of foreign relations does not appertain to the Suzerain, only supervision,\" and that the articles bearing ou these points must consequently be modified. They next attack the native question, stating that \" the Suzerain has not the right to interfere with our Legislature,\" and state that they cannot agree to Article 3, which gives the Suzerain a right of veto on Legislation connected with the natives ; to Article 13, by virtue of which natives are to be allowed to acquire land ; and to the last part of Article 26, by wbich it is provided that whites of alien race living in the Transvaal shall not be taxed in excess of the taxes imposed on Transvaal citizens. They further declare that it is infra dignitatem for the President of the Transvaal to be a member of a Commission. This refers to the Native Location Commission, on which he is, in the terms of the Con vention, to sit, together with the British Besident, and a third person jointly appointed."], [360, "THE TRANSVAAL. 276 They next declare that the amount of the debt for which the Commission has made them liable should be modified. Considering that England had already made them a present of from to this is a most barefaced demand. Finally, they state that \"Articles 15, 16, 26, and 27 are superfluous, and only calculated to wound our sense of honour\" (sic). Article 15 enacts that no slavery or apprenticeship shall be tolerated. Article 16 provides for religious toleration. Article 26 provides for the free movement, trading, and residence of all persons, other than natives, con forming themselves to the laws of the Transvaal. Article 27 gives to all the right of free access to tbe Courts of Justice. Putting the \"sense of honour\" of tbe Transvaal Volksraad out of the question, past experience has but too plainly proved that these Articles are by no means superfluous. In reply to this message, Sir Hercules Eobinson telegraphs to the British Besident on the 21st October in the following words : \u2014 \"Having forwarded Volksraad Besolution of 15th to Earl of Kimberley, I am desired to instruct you in reply to repeat to tbe Triumvirate that Her Majesty's Government cannot entertain any proposals for a modi fication of tbe Convention until after it has been rati fied, and tbe necessity for further concession proved by experience.\" I wish to draw particular attention to the last part of this message, which is extremely typical of the line of policy adopted throughout in the Transvaal"], [361, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 277 business. Tbe English Government dared not make any further concession to the Boers, because they felt that they had already strained tbe temper of the country almost to breaking in the matter. On the other hand, they were afraid that if they did not do something, the Boers would tear up the Convention, and they would find themselves face to face with the old difficulty. Under these circumstances, they have fallen back upon their temporising and un-English policy, which leaves them a back-door to escape through, whatever turn things take. Should the Boers now suddenly turn round and declare, which is extremely probable, that they re pudiate their debt to us, or that they are sick of the presence of a British Besident, the Government will be able to announce that \"the necessity for further concession \" has now been \" proved by experience,\" and thus escape the difficulty. In short, this tele gram has deprived the Convention of whatever final ity it may have possessed, and made it, as a document, as worthless as it is as a practical settlement. That this is the view taken of it by the Boers themselves, is proved by the text of the Batification which followed on the receipt of this telegram. The tone of this document throughout is, in my opinion, considering from whom it came, and agaiust whom it is directed, very insolent. And it amply confirms what I have previously said, that the Boers looked upon themselves as a victorious people making terms with those they have conquered. The Batifica tion leads off thus : \" The Volksraad is not satisfied with this Convention, and considers that the members of the Triumvirate performed a fervent act of love for the Fatherland when they upon their own responsibility"], [362, "THE TRANSVAAL. 278 signed such an unsatisfactory state document.\" This is damning with faint praise indeed. It then goes on to recite the various points of objection, stating that tbe answers from the English Government proved that they were well founded. \" Tbe English Government,\" it says, \" acknowledges indirectly by this answer (the telegram of 21st October, quoted above) that the difficulties raised by the Volksraad are neither fictitious nor unfounded, inasmuch as it desires from us the con cession that wes tbe Volksraad, shall submit it to a practical test.\" It wiU be observed that England is here represented as begging the favour of a trial of her conditions from tbe Volksraad of tbe Transvaal Boers. The Batification is in these words : \" Therefore is it that the Baad here unanimously resolves not to go into further discussion of the Convention, and maintaining all objections to the Convention as made before the Boyal Commission or stated in the Baad, and for the purpose of showing to everybody that the love of peace and unity inspires it, for the time and provisionally sub mitting the articles of the Convention to a practical test, hereby complying with the request of the English Government contained in the telegram of the 13th October 1881, proceeds to ratify tbe Convention.\" It would have been interesting to have seen how such a Batification as this, which is no Batification but an insult, would have been accepted by Lord Beacons field. I think that within twenty-four hours of its arrival in Downing Street, the Boer Volksraad would have received a startling answer. But Lord Beaconsfield is dead, and by his successor it was received with all due thankfulness and humility. His words, however, on this subject still remain to us, and even bis great"], [363, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 279 rival might have done well to listen to them. It was in the course of what was, I believe, tbe last speech he made in the House of Lords, that speaking about the Transvaal rising, he warned the Government that it was a very dangerous thing to make peace with rebellious subjects in arms against the authority of tbe Queen. The warning passed unheeded, and the peace was made in the way I have described. As regards the Convention itself, it will be obvious to the reader that the Boers have not any intention of acting up to its provisions, mild as they are, if they can possibly avoid them, whilst, on the other hand, there is no force at hand to punish their disregard or breach. It is all very well to create a Besident with extensive powers ; but bow is he to enforce his deci sions ? What is he to do if his awards are laughed at and made a mockery of, as they are and will be ? The position of Mr. Hudson at Pretoria is even worse than that of Mr. Osborn in Zululand. For instance, the Convention specifies in tbe first article that the Trans vaal is to be known as the Transvaal State. The Boer Government have, however, thought fit to adopt the name of \" South African Bepublic \" in all public docu ments. Mr. Hudson was accordingly directed to remonstrate, which lie did in a feeble way ; his remon strance was politely acknowledged, but the country is still officially called the South African Republic, tbe Convention and Mr. Hudson's remonstrance notwith standing. Mr. Hudson, however, appears to be better suited to the position than w-ould have been the case had an Englishman, pure and simple, been appointed, since it is evident that things that would have struck the latter as insults to the Queen be represented,"], [364, "280 THE TRANSVAAL. and his country generally, are not so understood by bim. In fact, he admirably represents his official superiors in bis capacity of swallowing rebuffs, and when smitten on one cheek delightedly offering the other. Thus we find him attending a Boer meeting of thanks sivins for tbe success that bad waited on tbeir arms and the recognition of their independence, where most people will consider be was out of place. To this meeting, thus graced by bis presence, an address was piesented by a branch of tbe Africander Bond, a powerful institution, having for its object tbe total uprootal of English rule and English customs in South Africa, to which he must have listened with pleasure. In it be, in common with other members of the meeting, is informed that \" you took up the sword and struck the Briton with such force \" that \" the Britons through fear revived that sense of justice to which they could not be brought by petitions,\" and that the \" day will soon come that we shall enter with you on one arena for the entire independence of South Africa,\" i.e., independ ence from English rule. On the following day the Government gave a dinner, to which all those who had done good service during the late hostilities were invited, tbe British Besident being apparently the only Englishman asked. Amongst the other celebrities present I notice the name of Buskes. This man, who is an educated Hollander, was the moving spirit of the Potchefstroom atrocities; indeed, so dark is his reputation that the Boyal Commission refused to transact business with him, or to admit him to their presence. Mr. Hudson was not so particular. And now comes the most extraordinary part of the"], [365, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 281 episode. At the dinner it was necessary that tbe health of Her Majesty as Suzerain should be proposed, and with studied insolence this was done last of all the leading political toasts, and immediately after that of tbe Triumvirate. Notwithstanding this fact, and that the toast was couched by Mr. Joubert, who stated that \" he would not attempt to explain what a Suzerain was,\" in what appear to be semi-ironical terms, we find that Mr. Hudson \" begged to tender bis thanks to the Honourable Mr. Joubert for the kind way in which he proposed tbe toast.\" It may please Mr. Hudson to see the name of the Queen thus metaphorically dragged in triumph at the chariot wheels of the Triumvirate, but it is satisfac tory to know that the spectacle is not appreciated in England : since, on a question in the House of Lords, by the Earl of Carnarvon, who characterised it as a deliberate insult, Lord Kimberley replied that the British Besident had been instructed that in future he was not to attend public demonstrations unless he had previously informed himself that the name of Her Majesty would be treated with proper respect. Let us hope that this official reprimand will have its effect, and that^Mr. Hudson will learn therefrom that there is such a thing as trop de zile \u2014 even in a good cause. The Convention is now a thing of the past, the appropriate rewards have been lavishly distributed to its framers, and President Brand has at last prevailed upon the Volksraad of the Orange Free State to allow him to become a Knight Grand Cross of Saint Michael and Saint George, \u2014 the same prize looked forward to by our most distinguished public servants at the close of the devotion of their life to the service of their"], [366, "THE TRANSVAAL. 282 country. But its results are yet to come \u2014 though it would be difficult to forecast the details of their development. One thing, however, is clear : the signing of that document signalised an entirely new departure in South African affairs, and brought us within a measurable distance of tbe abandonment, for the pre sent at any rate, of the supremacy of English rule in South Africa. This is the larger issue of the matter, and it is already bearing fruit. Emboldened by their success in the Transvaal, the Dutch party at the Cape are demanding, and the demand is to be granted, that the Dutch tongue be admitted pari passu with English, as the official language in the' Law Courts and the .House of Assembly. When a country thus consents to use a foreign tongue equally with its own, it is a sure sign that those who speak it are rising to power. But \" tbe Barty \" looks higher than this, and openly aims at throwing off English rule altogether, and declaring South Africa a great Dutch republic. The course of events is favourable to their aspiration. Besponsible Government is to be granted to Natal, which country, not being strong enough to stand alone in the face of the many dangers that surround her, will be driven into the arms of the Dutch party to save herself from destruction. It will be useless for her to look for help from England, and any feelings of repugnance she may feel to Boer rule will soon be choked by necessity, and a mutual interest. It is, however, possible that some unforeseen event, such as the advent to power of a strong Conservative Ministry, may check the tide that now sets so strongly in favour of Dutch supremacy."], [367, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 2S3 It seems to me, however, to be a question worthy of the consideration of those who at present direct the destinies of the Empire, whether it would not be wise, as they have gone so far, to go a little further and favour a scheme for tbe total abandonment of South Africa, retaining only Table Bay. If they do not, it is now quite within the bounds of sober possi bility that they may one day have to face a fresh Transvaal rebellion, only on a ten times larger scale, and might find it difficult to retain even Table Bay. If, on the other hand, they do, I believe that all the White States in South Africa would confederate of their own free-will, under the pressure of the necessity for common action, and the Dutch element being pre ponderant, at once set to work to exterminate the natives on general principles, in much the same way, and from much the same motives that a cook exter minates black beetles, because she thinks them ugly, and to clear the kitchen. I need hardly say that such a policy is not one that commands my sympathy, but Her Majesty's Government having put their hand to the plough, it is worth their while to consider it. It would at any rate be in perfect accordance with their declared sentiments, and command an enthusiastic support from their followers. As regards the smaller and more immediate issue of tbe retrocession, namely, its effect on the Transvaal itself, it cannot be other than evil. The act is, I believe, quite without precedent in our history, and it is difficult to see, looking at it from those high grounds of national morality assumed by the Govern ment, what greater arguments can be advanced in its"], [368, "THE TRANSVAAL. 284 favour, than could be found to support tbe abandon ment of, \u2014 let us say, \u2014 Ireland. Indeed a certain parallel undoubtedly exists between the circumstances of tbe two countries. Ireland was, like the Transvaal, annexed, though a long time ago, and has continually agitated for its freedom. The Irish bate us, so did the Boers. In Ireland, Englishmen are being shot, and England is running the awful risk of blood guiltiness, as it did in tbe Transvaal. In Ireland, smouldering revolution is being fanned into flame by Mr. Gladstone's speeches and acts, as it was in the Transvaal. In Ireland, as in the Transvaal, there exists a strong loyal class that receives insults instead of support from the Government, and whose property, as was tbe case there, is taken from them without compensation, to be flung as a sop to stop tbe mouths of tbe Queen's enemies. And so I might go on, finding many such similarities of circumstances, but my parallel, like most parallels, must break down at last. Thus \u2014 it mattered little to England whether or no she let the Transvaal go, but to let Ireland go would be more than even Mr. Gladstone dare attempt. Somehow, if you follow these things far enough, you always come to vulgar first principles. The dif ference between the case of the Transvaal and that of Ireland is a difference not of justice of cause, for both causes are equally unjust or just according as they are viewed, but of mere common expediency. Judging from the elevated standpoint of the national morality theory however, which, as we know, soars above such truisms as the foolish statement that force is a remedy, or that if you wish to retain your prestige you must not allow defeats to pass unavenged, I can-"], [369, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 285 not see why, if it was righteous to abandon the Trans vaal, it would not be equally righteous to abandon Ireland ! As for the Transvaal, that country is not to be congratulated on its success, for it has destroyed all its hopes of permanent peace, has ruined its trade and credit, and has driven away the most useful and productive class in the community. The Boers, elated by their success in arms, will be little likely to settle down to peaceable occupations, and still less likely to pay their taxes, which, indeed, I hear they are already refusing to do. They have learnt how easily even a powerful Government can be upset, and the lesson is not likely to be forgotten, for want of repeti tion to tbeir own weak one. Already the Transvaal Government hardly knows which way to turn for funds, and is, perhaps fortu nately for itself, quite unable to borrow, through want of credit. As regards the native question, I agree with Mr. H. Shepstone, who, in his Beport on this subject, says that he does not believe that the natives will inaugurate any action against the Boers, so long as the latter do not try to collect taxes, or otherwise interfere with them. But if the Boer Government is to continue to exist, it will be bound to raise taxes from the natives, since it cannot collect much from its white subjects. The first general attempt of the sort will be the signal for active resistance on the part of the natives, whom, if they act without concert, the Boers will be able to crush in detail, though with considerable loss. If, on the other hand, they should have happened, during the last few years, to have learnt"], [370, "286 THE TRANSVAAL. the advantages of combination, as is quite possible, perhaps they will crush tbe Boers. The only thing that is at present certain about the matter is that there will be bloodshed, and that before long. For instance, the Montsioa difficulty in the Keate Award has in it the possibilities of a serious war, and there are plenty such difficulties ready to spring into life within and without the Transvaal. In all human probability it will take but a small lapse of time for tbe Transvaal to find itself in the identical position from which we relieved it by the Annexation. What course events will then take it is impossible. to say. It may be found desirable to re-annex the country, though, in my opinion, that would be, after all that has passed, an unfortunate step; its inhabi tants may be cut up piecemeal by a combined move ment of native tribes, as they would have been, had they not been rescued by the English Government in 1877, or it is possible that the Orange Free State may consent to take the Transvaal under its wing: who can say ? There is only one thing that our re cently abandoned possession can count on for certain, and that is trouble, both from its white subjects, and the natives, who hate the Boers with a bitter and a weU-earned hatred. The whole question can, so far as its moral aspect is concerned, be summed up in a few words. Whether or no the Annexation was a necessity at the moment of its execution \u2014 which I certainly maintain it was \u2014 it received the unreserved sanction of the Home authorities,' and the relations of Sovereign and subject, with all the many and mutual obligations"], [371, "THE RETROCESSION OF THE TRANSVAAL. 287 involved in that connection, were established between the Queen of England and every individual of the motley population of tbe Transvaal. Nor was this change an empty form, for, to the largest proportion of that population, this transfer of allegiance brought with it a priceless and a vital boon. To them it meant freedom and justice \u2014 for where, on any portion of this globe over which the British ensign floats, does the law even wink at cruelty or wrong ? A few years passed away, and a small number of tbe Queen's subjects in the Transvaal rose in rebellion against her authority, and inflicted some reverses on her arms. Thereupon, in spite of the reiterated pledges given to the contrary \u2014 partly under stress of defeat, and partly in obedience to tbe pressure of \" advanced views \" \u2014 the country was abandoned, and the vast majority who bad remained faithful to the Crown, was banded to the cruel despotism of the minority who had rebelled against it. Such an act of treachery to those to whom we were bound with double chains \u2014 by the strong ties of a common citizenship, and by those claims to England's protection from violence and wrong which have hitherto been wont to command it, even where there was no duty to fulfil, and no authority to vindicate \u2014 stands, I believe, without parallel on our records, and marks a new departure in our history. I cannot end these pages without expressing my admiration of the extremely able way in which the Boers managed tbeir revolt, when once they felt that, having undertaken the thing, it was a question of life and death with them. It shows that they have \u2022rood stuff in them somewhere, which, under the"], [372, "288 THE TRANSVAAL. firm but just rule of Her Majesty, might have been much developed, and it makes it the more sad that they should have been led to throw off that rule, and have been allowed to do so by an English Government. In conclusion, there is one point that I must touch on, and that is the effect of the retrocession on the native mind, which I can only describe as most disastrous. The danger alluded to in the Beport of the Boyal Commission has been most amply realised, and the prevailing belief in tbe steadfastness of our policy, and the inviolability of our plighted word, which has hitherto been the great secret of our hold on the Kafirs, has been rudely shaken. The motives that influenced, or are said to have influenced, the Government in their act, are naturally quite unin telligible to savages, however clever, who do believe that force is a remedy, and who have seen the in habitants of a country ruled by England defeat English soldiers and take possession of it, whilst those who remained loyal to England were driven out of it. It will not be wonderful if some of them, say tbe natives of Natal, deduce therefrom conclusions unfavourable to loyalty, and evince a desire to try the same experiment. It is, however, unprofitable to speculate on the future, which must be left to unfold itself. The curtain is, so far as this country is concerned, down for tbe moment on tbe South African stage ; when it rises again, there is but too much reason to fear that it will reveal a state of confusion, which, unless it is more wisely and consistently dealt with in the future than it has been in tbe past, may develop into chaos."], [373, "APPENDIX T"], [374, ""], [375, "APPENDIX. i. THE POTCHEFSTROOM ATROCITIES, &c There were more murders and acts of cruelty committed during the war at Potchefstroom, where the behaviour of the Boers was throughout both deceitful and savage, than at any other place. When the fighting commenced a number of ladies and children, the wives and children of English residents, took refuge in the fort. Shortly after it had been invested they applied to be allowed to return to their homes in the town till the war was over. The request was refused by the Boer commander, who said that as they had gone there, they might stop and \" perish \" there. One poor lady, the wife of a gentleman well known in the Transvaal, was badly wounded by having the point of a stake, which had been cut in two by a bullet, driven into her side. She was at the time in a state of pregnancy, and died some days afterwards in great agony. Her little sister was shot through the throat, and several other women and children suffered from bullet wounds, and fever arising from their being obliged to live for months exposed to rain and heat, with insufficient food. The moving spirit of all the Potchefstroom atrocities was a cruel wretch of the name of Buskes, a well-educated man, who, as an advocate of the High Court, had taken the oath of allegiance to the Queen."], [376, "APPENDIX. 292 One deponent swears that be saw this Buskes wearing Captain Fall's diamond ring, which he bad taken from Sergeant Kitchie, to whom it was banded to be sent to England, and also that he had possessed himself of the carriages and other goods belonging to prisoners taken by the Boers.1 Another deponent (whose name is omitted in the Blue Book for precautionary reasons) swears, \" That on the next night the patrol again came to my house accom panied by one Buskes, who was secretary of the Boer Com mittee, and again asked where my wife and daughter were. I replied, in bed; and Buskes then said, 'I must see for myself.' I refused to allow him, and he forced me, with a loaded gun held to my breast, to open the curtains of the bed, when he pulled tbe bedclothes half off my wife, and altogether off my daughter. I then told him if I had a gun I would shoot him. He placed a loaded gun at my breast, when my wife sprang out of bed and got between us.\" I remember hearing at the time that this Buskes (who is a good musician) took one of his victims, who was on the way to execution, into tbe chapel and played the \" Dead March in Saul,\" or some such piece, over him on the organ. After the capture of the Court House a good many English men fell into the hands of the Boers. Most of these were sentenced to hard labour and deprivation of \" civil rights.\" The sentence was enforced by making them work in the trenches under a heavy fire from the fort. One poor fellow, F. W. Finlay by name, got his head blown off by a shell from his own friends in the fort, and several loyal Kafirs suffered the same fate. After these events the remaining prisoners refused to return to the trenches till they had been \" tamed \" by being thrashed with the butt end of guns, and by threats of receiving twenty-five lashes each. But tbeir fate, bad as it was, was not so awful as that suffered by Dr. Woite and J. Van der Linden. 1 Buskes was afterwards forced to deliver up the ring."], [377, "THE POTCHEFSTROOM ATROCITIES, ETC. 293 Dr. Woite had attended the Boer meeting which was held before the outbreak, and written a letter from thence to Major Clarke, in which he had described the talk of the Boers as silly bluster. He was not a paid spy. This letter was, unfortunately for him, found in Major Clarke's pocket-book, and because of it he was put through a form of trial, taken out and shot dead, all on the same day. He left a wife and large family, who afterwards found their way to Natal in a destitute condition. The case of Van der Linden is somewhat similar. He was one of Baaf's Volunteers, and as such had taken the oath of allegiance to the Queen. In the execution of his duty he made a report to his commanding officer about the Boer meeting, and which afterwards fell into the hands of the Boers. On this he was put through the form of trial, and, though in the service of the Queen, was found guilty of treason and condemned to death. One of his judges, a little less stony-hearted than the rest, pointed out that \"when the prisoner committed the crime martial law had not yet been proclaimed, nor the State,\" but it availed him nothing. He was taken out and shot. A Kafir named Carolus was also put through the form of trial and shot, for no crime at all that I can discover. Ten unarmed Kafir drivers, who had been sent away from the fort, were shot down in cold blood by a party of Boers. Several witnesses depose to having seen their remains lying together close by Potchefstroom. Various other Kafirs were shot. None of the perpetrators of these crimes were brought to justice. The Royal Com mission comments on these acts as follows : \u2014 \" In regard to the deaths of Woite, Van der Linden, and Carolus, the Boer leaders do not deny the fact that those men bad been executed, but sought to justify it. The majority of your Commissioners felt bound to record their opinion that the taking of the lives of these men was an act contrary to"], [378, "APPENDIX. 294 the rules of civilised warfare. Sir H. de Villiers was of opinion that the executions in these cases, having been ordered by properly constituted court martial of the Boers' forces after due trial, did not fall under the cognisance of your Commissioners. \" Upon the case of William Finlay the majority of your Commissioners felt bound to record the opinion that the sacrifice of Finlay's life, through forced labour under fire in the trenches, was an act contrary to the rules of civilised warfare. Sir H. de Villiers did not feel justified by the facts of the case in joining in this expression of opinion (sic). As to the case of the Kafir Andries, your Commissioners decided that, although the shooting of this man appeared to them, from the information laid before them, to be not in accord ance with the rules of civilised warfare, under all the cir cumstances of the case, it was not desirable to insist upon a prosecution.\" \" The majority of your Commissioners, although feeling it a duty to record emphatically their disapproval of the acts that resulted in the deaths of Woite, Van der Linden, Finlay, and Carolus, yet found it impossible to bring to justice the persons guilty of these acts.\" It will be observed that Sir H. de Villiers does not express any disapproval, emphatic or otherwise, of these wicked murders. But Potchefstroom did not enjoy a monopoly of murder. In December 1880, Captain Elliot, who was a survivor from tbe Bronker Spruit massacre, and Captain Lambart, who had been taken prisoner by the Boers whilst bringing remounts from the Free State, were released from Heidel berg on parol on condition that they left the country. An escort of two men brought them to a drift of the Vaal river, where they refused to cross, because they could not get their cart through, the river being in flood. The escort then returned to Heidelberg and reported that the officers would"], [379, "THE POTCHEFSTROOM ATROCITIES, ETC. 295 not cross. A civil note was then sent back to Captain Elliot and Lambart, signed by P. J. Joubert, telling them \" to pass the Vaal river immediately by the road that will be shown to you.\" What secret orders, if any, were sent with this letter has never transpired ; but I decline to be lieve that, either in this or in Barber's case, the Boer escort took upon themselves the responsibility of murdering their prisoners, without authority of some kind for the deed. The men despatched from Heidelberg with the letter found Lambart and Elliot wandering about and trying to find the way to Standerton. They presented the letter, and took them towards a drift in the Vaal. Shortly before they got there the prisoners noticed that their escort had been rein forced. It would be interesting to know, if these extra men were not sent to assist in the murder, how and why they turned up as they did and joined themselves to the escort. The prisoners were taken to an old and disused drift of the Vaal river and told to cross. It was now dark, and the river was much swollen with rain ; in fact, impassable for the cart and horses. Captains Elliot and Lambart begged to be allowed to outspan till the next morning, but were told that they must cross, which they accordingly attempted to do. A few yards from the bank the cart stuck on a rock, and whilst in this position the Boer escort poured a volley into it. Poor Elliot was instantly killed, one bullet fracturing his skull, another passing through the back, a third shatter ing the right thigh, and a fourth breaking the left wrist. The cart was also riddled, but strange to say, Captain Lambart was untouched, and succeeded in swimming to the further bank, the Boers firing at him whenever the flashes of lightning revealed his whereabouts. After sticking some time in the mud of the bank he managed to effect his escape, and next day reached the house of an Englishman called Groom, living in the Free State, and from thence made his way to Natal."], [380, "APPENDIX. 296 Two of the murderers were put through a form of trial, after the conclusion of peace, and acquitted. The case of the murder of Dr. Barber is of a somewhat similar character to that of Elliot, except that there is in this case a curious piece of indirect evidence that seems to connect the murder directly with Piet Joubert, one of the Triumvirate. In the month of February 1881, two Englishmen came to the Boer laager at Lang's Nek to offer their services as doctors. Their names were Dr. Barber, who was well known to the Boers, and his assistant, Mr. Walter Dyas, and they came, not from Natal, but the Orange Free State. On arrival at the Boer camp they were at first well received, but after a little while seized, searched, and tied up all night to a disselboom (pole of a waggon). Next morning they were told to mount their horses, and started from the camp escorted by two men who were to take them over the Free State line. When they reached the Free State line the Boers told them to get off their horses, which they were ordered to bring back to the camp. They did so, bade good-day to their escort, and started to walk on towards their destina tion. When they had gone about forty yards Dyas heard the report of a rifle, and Barber called out, \" My God, I am shot ! \" and fell dead. Dyas went down on his hands and knees and saw one of the escort deliberately aim at him. He then jumped up, and ran dodging from right to left, trying to avoid tbe bullet. Presently the man fired, and he felt himself struck through the thigh. He fell with his face to the men, and saw his would-be assassin put a fresh cartridge into his rifle and aim at him. Turning bis face to the ground he awaited his death, but the bullet whizzed past his head. He then saw the men take the horses and go away, thinking they bad finished him. After waiting a while he managed to get up,"], [381, "THE POTCHEFSTROOM ATROCITIES, ETC. 297 and struggled to a house not far off, where be was kindly treated and remained till he recovered. Some time after this occurrence a Hottentot, named Allan Smith, made a statement at Newcastle, from which it appears that he had been taken prisoner by the Boers and made to work for them. One night he saw Barber and Dyas tied to the disselboom, and overheard the following, which I will give in his own words : \u2014 \" I went to a fire where some Boers were sitting ; among them was a low-sized man, moderately stout, with a dark brown full beard, apparently about thirty-five years of age. I do not know his name. He was telling his comrades that he had brought an order from Piet Joubert to Viljoen, to take the two prisoners to the Free State line and shoot them there. He said, in the course of conversation, ' Piet Joubert het gevraacht waarom was de mensche neet dood geschiet toen hulle bijde eerste laager gekom het.' ('Piet Joubert asked why were the men not shot when they came to the first laager.') They then saw me at the fire, and one of them said, ' You must not talk before that fellow ; he understands what you say, and will tell everybody.' \" Next morning Viljoen told me to go away, and gave me a pass into the Free State. He said (in Dutch), 'You must not drive for any Englishman again. If we catch you doing so we will shoot you, and if you do not go away quick, and we catch you hanging about when we bring the two men to the line, we will shoot you too.' \" Dyas, who escaped, made an affidavit with reference to this statement in which he says, \" I have read the foregoing affidavit of Allan Smith, and I say that the person described in the third paragraph thereof as bringing orders from Piet Joubert to Viljoen, corresponds with one of the Boers who took Dr. Barber and myself to the Free State, and to the best of my belief he is the man who shot Dr. Barber.\" Tbe actual murderers were put on their trial in the Free"], [382, "298 APPENDIX. State, and, of course, acquitted. In his examination at the trial, Allan Smith says, \"It was a young man who said that Joubert had given orders that Barber had to be shot. . . . It was not at night, but in the morning early, when the young man spoke about Piet Joubert's order.\" Most people will gather, from what I have quoted, that there exists a certain connection between the dastardly murder of Dr. Barber (and the attempted murder of Mr. Dyas) and Piet Joubert, one of that *\u2022*** able \" Triumvirate of which Mr. Gladstone speaks so highly. I shall only allude to one more murder, though more are reported to have occurred, amongst them that of Mr. Mal colm, who was kicked to death by Boers, \u2014 and that is Mr. Green's. Mr. Green was an English gold-digger, and was travelling along the main road to his home at Spitzcop. The road passed close by the military camp at Lydenburg, into which he was called. On coming out he went to a Boer patrol with a flag of truce, and whilst talking to them was shot dead. The Bev. J. Thorne, the English clergyman at Lydenburg, describes this murder in an affidavit in the following words : \u2014 \" That I was the clergyman who got together a party of Englishmen and brought down the body of Mr. Green who was murdered by the Boers and buried it. I have ascertained the circumstances of the murder, which were as follows : \u2014 Mr. Green was on his way to the gold-fields. As he was passing the fort, he was called in by the officers, and sent out again with a message to the Boer commandant. Immediately on leaving the camp, he went to the Boer guard opposite with a flag of truce in his hand ; while parleying with the Boers, who proposed to make a prisoner of him, he was shot through the head.\" No prosecution was instituted in this case.

The following extracts from the speeches, despatches, and telegrams of members of tbe present Government, with refer ence to the proposed retrocession of the Transvaal, are not without interest : \u2014 During the month of May 1880, Lord Kimberley des patched a telegram to Sir Bartle Frere, in which the follow ing words occur : \" Under no circumstances can the Queen's authority in the Transvaal be relinquished.\" In a despatch dated 20th May, and addressed to Sir Bartle Frere, Lord Kimberley says, \" That the sovereignty of the Queen in the Transvaal could not be relinquished.\" In a speech in the House of Lords on the 24th May 1880, Lord Kimberley said : \u2014 \" There was a still stronger reason than that for not reced ing ; it was impossible to say what calamities such a step as receding might not cause. We had, at the cost of much blood and treasure, restored peace, and the effect of our now reversing our policy would be to leave the province in a state of anarchy, and possibly to cause an internecine war. For such a risk, he could not make himself responsible. Tho number of the natives in the Transvaal was estimated at about 800,000, and that of the whites less than 50,000.

Nothing could be more unfortunate than un certainty in respect to such a matter.\" On the 8th June 1880, Mr. Gladstone, in reply to a Boer memorial, wrote as follows : \u2014 \" It is undoubtedly a matter for much regret that it should, since tbe Annexation, have appeared that so large a number of the population of Dutch origin in the Transvaal are opposed to the annexation of that territory, but it is impossible now to consider that question as if it were presented for the first time. We have to do with a state of things which has existed for a considerable period, during which obligations have been contracted, especially, though not exclusively, towards, the native population, which cannot be set aside. Looking to all the circumstances, both of the Transvaal and the rest of South Africa, and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of disorders, which might lead to disastrous consequences, not only to the Transvaal but to the whole of South Africa, our judgment is that the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish the Transvaal. \" Her Majesty's Speech, delivered in Parliament on the 6th January 1881, contains the following words: \"A rising in the Transvaal has recently imposed upon me the duty of vindicating my authority.\" These extracts are rather curious reading in face of the policy adopted by the Government, after our troops had been defeated."], [385, "301 III.

When the war began all the Meyer family moved further into the Transvaal, my son going with them as herd. I went up to Klip River with them as driver, where the river forms the boundary between the Free State and Transvaal. I returned at once, leaving my son with the Meyers. He was a small boy about twelve years of age. At tbe termination of the war the Meyers sent for me to drive them down. I met them a day's journey this side of Klip River. I asked them where my son was. Old Isaac Meyer told me he had sent him to look for horses ; he did not return ; and another boy was sent who brought the horses. The horses were found close by. No one went to look for my son. I asked old Isaac Meyer for leave to go and offer a reward amongst the Kafirs for my son. He refused, saying I must drive him home, and then he would give me a pass to come back and look for him. On our arrival at the farm I and my wife again applied to old Isaac Meyer to be allowed to go and see about my son. He refused, saying I must first shear the sheep. I replied that be well knew that I could not shear sheep. I said, ' How can I work when my heart is sore for my son ? ' Meyer said again that I must wait awhile as the rivers were full. I said how could that matter, seeing that both in coming and going with the waggons we crossed no rivers As he refused me a pass, I started without one to seek my son. On arrival at Mavovo's kraal I met my brother, who told me that I must go no further, or the Boers would shoot me. Having no pass I returned. On my return my wives told me that the Meyers had come every morning to look for me with guns to shoot me, telling them that ' it was now no longer the days for sjamboking (flogging with hide whips)"], [387, "THE CASE OF INDABEZIMBI. 303 the natives, but the days for shooting them.' On hearing this I collected my goods, and by morning had everything on the Natal side of the Buffalo River \u2014 on Natal ground. About mid-day Martinus Meyer overtook us by Degaza's kraal and asked me what I was doing on tbe Natal side of the river. I told him I was leaving for Natal, because I found it altogether too hot for me in the Transvaal. Ho said that if I came back he would make everything comfort able. I refused. He then attacked me with a knobkerrie, and would have killed me had not one of my wives, seeing that I was badly hurt, knocked him down with a piece of iron. Martinus then mounted his borse and galloped off. I then got on my horse and fled. My wives hid themselves. In the afternoon there came to the waggon Jan Meyer, Martinus Meyer, young Isaac Meyer, and the man called Cornelius. They hunted all about for us with the object of shooting us, as they told Degaza's Kafirs. My wives then saw them inspan the waggon and take everything away. I had a waggon, twelve oxen, four cows, and a mare, also a box containing two hundred pounds in gold, a telescope, clothes, and other things. My wives found the box broken on the ground and all the contents gone. Forty sacks of grain belonging to me were also taken. I was robbed of everything I had, with the exception of the horse I escaped on. The waggon was one I hired from my brother (a rela tion) ; the oxen were my own brother's. Eighty pounds of the money I got from the Standard Bank in Newcastle for oxen sold to the owner of the store on tbe Ingagane Drift. The rest I had accumulated in fees from doctoring.

During my husband's absence, the three sons of old Isaac Meyer, namely, Martinus, Jan, and Isaac, came every morn ing to search for my husband, saying, ' We will kill him, he leaves our work to go without our leave to look for the boy.' They came once with sjamboks, but afterwards with guns, saying they would kill him if they found him. I told my husband this directly he returned home. On hearing this my husband said, ' We cannot then stay here longer.' He then went at once and borrowed a waggon and twelve oxen, and during the night we packed the waggon three times, and took three loads across the Buffalo River to Degaza's kraal, which is on Natal ground, forty sacks of grain, in a box, with clothes and other things, also mats and skins, and four head of cattle and a horse.

The names of those who saw the Boers go away with the waggon are Gangtovo, Capaches, Noma tonga, Nomamane, and others. The Boers took away on the waggon that night all the last load we had brought over from the Transvaal, together with all our clothes ; and some of the sacks first brought over were loaded up, all our cattle were taken, and our box was broken, and the taken away.

It is signed \"Transvaal,\" probably because the author, were he to put his name at the foot of so candid a document, would find himself in much the same position as that occupied at the present moment by an Irish landlord who has outraged the susceptibilities of the Land League. He would be rigorously \"boycotted,\" and might, in the event of any disturbance, be made into a target. The Transvaal Boers are very sensitive to criticism, especially where their native policy is concerned. I take the liberty to reprint the letter here, partly because I feel sure that I shall be forwarding the wishes of the writer by assisting to give publicity to his facts, and partly on account of the striking and recent con firmation it affords, on every point, to my remarks on the same subjects : \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 In calling your attention to what is going on on the south-western border of the Transvaal, I may possibly tell you of some things which you may already have heard of, for in the present isolated condition of the country, with out telegraphs, and with a very imperfect postal system, added to tbe jealousy of the Boer Government in keeping their actions secret from the outside world, it is not only"], [394, "APPENDIX. 310 very difficult to get at the truth of what is happening, but tbe people in one portion of the country are in many cases totally ignorant of what is going on in another. Neverthe less, I feel it incumbent on me to call the attention of the English people, through your widely circulating journal, to what has come under my observation with reference to the disgraceful native war which is, and has been, raging on the south-west border of this country. \" During the late Boer war, you may be aware of the fact that a very large number, if not all, of the natives, were strongly in favour of the English Government, and only awaited the signal from it to rush upon their old oppressors. But the natives, although forbidden by the English Govern ment from joining with them against tbe Boers (it is hardly necessary to say that had it not been for this the war would have had a very different ending), nevertheless afforded an asylum and protection to the lives and property of refugee Englishmen and loyalists. Notable among these natives was a chief named Montsiou, whose tribe is situated just outside the borders of the Transvaal to the south-west. This chief and his people received numbers of refugees who fled to them for protection from the rapacity of the Boers, and watched over them and their property throughout tbe war. For this offence the Boers swore to be revenged on him, and hardly was the war finished when they commenced commandeering in the Potchefstroom district, under tbe pretence of protect ing their borders, but with the ostensible purpose of inflict ing chastisement on this loyal chief ; and, the better to effect their purpose, they allied themselves with a neighbour ing chief, who had some old grudge against him, and, by promises of assistance and hopes of plunder, induced him to commence a war, under cover of which they could join, and thus effect the purpose they had in view. \"The chiefs whom the Boers had instigated to harass Montsiou got the worst of it, and the action of the Boers,"], [395, "LETTER TO THE STANDARD. 31 1 who were actively commandeering in the Potchefstroom (district?), under Commandant Cronge, was brought to the notice of the Royal Commission through complaints made by loyal Boers, and resulted in an inquiry into the subject, which showed that his opponent was the aggressor, and was acting under the advice of and assistance from the Boers. The Royal Commission managed to patch matters up, but no sooner were their labours over, and the country fairly handed ever to the Boers, than Moshete and Masouw, insti gated by tbe Boers, commenced again harassing Montsiou, with the avowed purpose of bringing on a war, and so far succeeded as to oblige Montsiou to take up arms in self defence. \" From that time forward the war has gone on increasing in dimensions, until other chiefs have been drawn into it, and the Boer volunteers fighting against Montsiou and Monkoroane are almost equal in numbers to the natives. The Boers, while doing all they can to crush Montsiou on account of the protection he afforded loyalists during the late war against the English Government, are careful not to do it in an official way, because that might cause trouble with England, whereas, by aiding and assisting it privately, they could do quite as much without incurring responsibility. You may naturally ask how I know all this, and what proofs I can advance in support of it. Some time after the Royal Commission had left the country, and the war had com- menced again, Piet Joubert, who is Commandant-General, went down to the border with the object of putting an end to the war. This, I presume, he did for the sake of appear- ances, for it is well known that he entertains a strong hatred against those natives who in any way showed a partiality for British rule ; and when it is remembered that Piet Joubert's journey did not result in a cessation of hostilities, but in an increase, and that ever since his journey the war has increased in area and in numbers, and that in no single instance has a"], [396, "APPENDIX. 312 Boer volunteer been prevented crossing the border, or ammu nition for use against Montsiou been stopped, the sincerity of his intentions may well be doubted. \" Then, again, officers in the Boer Jagers went about Pre toria endeavouring to obtain volunteers to fight against Mont siou, saying that they were to have some months' leave from the Government, and that subscriptions would be raised to assist those men who had no private means. This took place almost immediately after Piet Joubert's return from the border, and while he was in Pretoria, and the general opinion was that he was at the bottom of it ; but as it became rather more public than was intended, the British Resident was obliged to take notice of it, and the result was that tHe Boers, though in general treating the British Resident with little consideration, thought it wisest to carry on their operations in a more private manner, more especially as their object could be attained quite as effectually in this way. \" While the Boers are assisting Moshete and Masouw by every means in their power, with the sole object of crushing Montsiou and Monkoroane, another loyal chief, the Colonial Government, no doubt under instructions from home, are doing their best to prevent volunteers or ammunition reach ing them, and have already arrested men in Kimberley, who have been trying to raise volunteers to go to their assistance. \" The result of this is, that the loyal chiefs are suffering under a double disadvantage ; for while their enemies are receiving every assistance, they are blockaded on all sides, and, through the action of the English Government in pre venting them obtaining assistance, are rapidly falling a prey to the Boers. Those only who know anything of the Boer method of warfare against natives will know what this means ; and in spite of the Boer Government doing all they can to keep things secret, horrible tales of the cruelties per petrated by them leak out occasionally. \" It seems to me a disgraceful thing, and a stain on the"], [397, "LETTER TO THE STANDARD. 313 honour of England, that these loyal chiefs and their tribes should be robbed, plundered, and shot down like dogs, simply because they afforded protection to the lives and pro perty of Englishmen during the late war, and yet these things are going on and are being perpetrated on the border of Eng land's Colonies. If England will not step in and insist on the Boers putting a stop to this murderous war, then in God's name let her not prevent these poor natives from obtaining ammunition and assistance to enable them to defend their country. They succoured our countrymen, and if we cannot succour them, the least we can do is not to interfere to prevent them from protecting themselves ! \" Of course, it suits the Boer Government to make out that they have nothing to do with the war, and cannot pre vent Boer volunteers from fighting these chiefs ; and so long as the English Government rests satisfied with these answers, so long will this disgraceful state of things go on. Let the English Government be firm, however, and insist on the Boers taking no part in this war, and it will cease \u2014 a sure proof that the Boer Government have the power to stop it if they have the will. \" Not only are the Boers wreaking vengeance upon Mont siou and Monkoroane, but a friend of theirs, a chief of the name of Kalafin, whose tribe is situated in the Zeerust dis trict, Transvaal, has been robbed by them of everything he possessed. This chief 'had English sympathies ; and as he presumed to build a wall round his town he gave the Boers the excuse they wanted. He was ordered to take the wall down, which be did, at the same time proving that he only built it to prevent his cattle straying among the huts. He was then ordered to come to Pretoria, which he did accord ingly. He was then ordered to pay a fine of three thousand cattle, which fine he paid. No sooner was this done than the Boers, bent on his ruin, raised the fine to ten thousand head. The poor chief in vain pleaded his inability to pay."], [398, "APPENDIX. 314 It was the old story of the wolf and the lamb. Because he couldn't pay, the Boers construed it into an act of disobedi ence, and at once ordered their men to go in and take every thing he possessed. This tribe is small and weak, which the Boers well knew. Eye-witnesses of what followed say it was a heartrending sight. The women, with children in their arms, pleaded in vain to the Boers to leave them some thing or they would starve, but tbe latter only jeered at them. What these poor people will do God only knows, for the Boers stripped them of every living thing they possessed, and with the proceeds of this robbery the Boer Government intend to replenish their coffers. \" The British Resident, Mr. Hudson, it is believed, shuts his eyes to many things. No doubt his is a difficult position to fill ; and doubtless he is aware that, if he reports every thing to the English Government, the Boers have it in tbeir power to make his position anything but a pleasant one. In any case, the English portion of community here, while admitting his good qualities socially, have little confidence in him officially. \" My object in writing this letter, however, is not so much to show what a disgraceful state the Government is in, as to try and awaken sympathy in the breasts of my countrymen for the cause of these loyal chiefs. While tbe Government are writing despatches to the British Resident, these chiefs and their people are being ruined past remedying.\" THE END. PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE, HANSON AND CO.
