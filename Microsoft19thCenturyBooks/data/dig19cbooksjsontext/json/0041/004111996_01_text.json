There have been other revo- lutions ; other monarchies have been overthrown ; other republics have been established; but nowhere in the annals of time can there be found an exact counterpart to the French Revolution of 1789 to 1799. As .to the causes of this appalling spectacle, none of the many historians who have written upon the subject have undertaken definitely, or exhaustively, to state all the causes thereof, or even to define com pletely those they suggest as bearing upon the sub sequent events. We are too near, and yet too far from those thrill ing scenes to obtain a perfect political perspective, whereby we may rightly judge of the necessary lights and shadows, and form a correct opinion of this re volting masterpiece of history, which, though it terri fies us by its ghastly horrors, is, nevertheless, a true picture of what unbridled evil, working through the ignoble passions of human nature, will produce when unrestrained by religion, intelligence, and law."], [14, "PREFACE. VI If one wishes to understand clearly regarding the various parties governing France, during the time of the French Revolution, and the decrees enacted by the successive assemblies, such knowledge will be gained more concisely by perusing the writings of Mignet than from the works of any other historian of that epoch. If a brilliant account, including all the principal events, is desired, read Michelet. If one prefers a quiet, stately narrative, without dra matic fire, read Thiers. If one would select character sketches of all the notable personages of the Revo lution, with little of the laws and government of France, such may be found in Lamartine's Girondists. If one is seeking to know definitely the effects of the Revolution in the provinces of France, rather than to study the more stirring events in Paris, read Taine. If one is anxious to follow the blood curdling horrors of the Reign of Terror, read the narratives of eye-witnesses of those times. Having thoroughly perused all these authorities, together with Louis Blanc, Henri Martin, Van Laun, and others, with numerous memoirs and sketches of that period, one is then prepared to comprehend and enjoy the great work of Carlyle. Having become familiar with the tragical events succeeding each other in the imposing procession of those momentous years, and having noted small de-"], [15, "PREFACE.

To those who have not the leisure to make such an exhaustive study of this remarkable epoch in the world's history, the present volume offers a rapid, and we hope a clear, resume of the most important events of the French Revolution. We have scattered here and there over its pages some of the brightest gems of thought, gathered from the treasure-stores of all these authors, so that the reader may obtain some knowledge of each of these illustrious historians without arduous research. By condensing into two chapters the account of the assemblies and their decrees, we have endeavored to present the thrilling scenes of the Revolution in a series of pen-pictures, which may pass rapidly before the mind's eye like the panoramic views of the stereopticon, and, as the descriptions are arranged in chronological order, a condensed history of the French Revolution is thereby consecutively narrated.

Before him bowed in rever ence ambassadors from every court in Europe ; and at his footstool knelt, in adoration, his aristocratic subjects, well honored if their titles bestowed upon them the inestimable favor of being allowed to enter his august presence, and minister to his splendor by their own dazzling appearance and courtly obeisance. Versailles, after twenty-five years of labor and lavish expenditure, was at length in sufficiently regal state to receive its royal owner ; and this scene was one of many superb spectacles which occurred during the splendid fetes attendant upon the celebration of the completion of that famous palace. Royalty sat enthroned, appar ently, upon a loftier pinnacle of power than ever before, and bold indeed must have been the audacious spirit who should have dared to predict that the founda tions of that transcendent throne were crumbling, and that the royal diadem would ere long be cast contemptu ously in the dust, and the imperious sceptre of authority be grasped by the grimy fingers of the hitherto despised and ignored canaille. But turning upon this imposing scene the light of history, we can discover dark shadows lurking, like spectres, in the background of that resplendent picture. Even amidst this blaze of priceless jewels, and shimmer ing satins, and stately salons filled with costly adorn ments, yes, even half hiding behind those imperial canopies, may be partially discerned a dim, gaunt figure with cadaverous eyes, hollow cheeks, livid lips and shak ing fingers, upon whose forehead appears the terrible name of Revolution. And if one's ear were attuned to catch the mystic sounds floating in the air, already the distant murmur of a coming voice might be faintly heard; that voice \u2014 Opinion \u2014 which shall ere"], [23, "3 CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. long announce in thunder-tones the rising of a mightier power than even this personification of royal prerogative \u2014 the irresistible authority of a Sovereign People. The history of the French Revolution seems, by the necessary sequence of its events, forcefully to ask and answer the following questions : \u2014 Why was the French Revolution permitted by Prov idence ? To serve as an example to the nations : that both des potism and anarchy inevitably lead only to destruction. Why was it allotted to France rather than to one of the other nations ? Because France denied religion, ignored God, and worshipped human reason. God withheld not from them men of great genius ; Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rous seau, Mirabeau, with many others, formed a galaxy of brilliant intellects, which could have proved, if such a thing were possible of proof, that human reason was sufficient for a nation's welfare. But the French Revo lution is an unanswerable argument against the efficacy of the human mind alone, without the aid of God and His influence, as revealed in religion, made known to man by Christ and His gospel of love, to uplift man kind, and hold a nation in prosperity and happiness. They had human reason, but they ignored God and what did it avail ? Why was the awful Reign of Terror permitted by an overruling Providence ? Before the just and perfect purposes of God we must be reverently dumb ; and yet God teaches the world by revelation and by history. And the Reign of Terror most fully exemplifies two facts: that human reason alone, unaided by God's regenerating Spirit, can never restrain evil, either in individuals or in nations ; and"], [24, "2 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. anarchy can never bring to a people the blessing of liberty, but will always enslave a nation. For the god of anarchy is the Devil, and he only desires man's de struction. Royalty in France had to suffer, for royalty had become during past reigns only despotism. The people had to suffer in the Revolution, for the people denied God, and worshipped the Devil under the name of Anarchy; and therefore they became his slaves, to work out his satanic schemes of ruin. France was given over to human rea son, in the first stages of the Revolution. France was given over to the Devil, in the Reign of Terror, not by a merciful God, but by her own election; and the French Revolution has thereby become for all time a warning to nations, proving that neither human reason, nor anarchy, can ever bring liberty to the souls or bodies of men ; and that only when man's reason is en lightened by God's Holy Spirit, shall true fraternity be possible ; and that only when wild license is restrained by wise law, shall freedom be attained. As to the causes of the French Revolution, we have selected from the most eminent authorities, the follow ing statements ; and to have a clear idea of the subject, we must discriminate distinctly between the Principle of the Revolution, as cherished by lovers and promoters of equal liberty \u2014 such as La Fayette and the Moderate Parties \u2014 and the wild rage for license \u2014 misnamed lib erty \u2014 which became the war-cry of the brutal instiga tors and actors in the awful scenes of the Reign of Terror. \"Two principles and two spirits met and struggled together in the French Revolution: one, the original and natural principle which had produced the Revolu tion, namely, justice and equitable humanity; and the"], [25, "la fayette."], [26, ""], [27, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 5 other the principle of expedients and interest, which was called the public safety, and which ruined France; \u2014 ruined her, inasmuch as casting her into a crescendo of assassination which could not be stopped, it made France execrable throughout Europe, and inspired ever lasting hatred against her ; ruined her, inasmuch as the minds of men, being dejected, after the Reign of Terror, from disgust and remorse, rushed blindly into the yoke of military despotism ; and ruined her, inasmuch as this glorious tyranny ended in placing her enemies in Paris, and her chief at St Helena.'' 1 Lamartine says : \" The hand of God is visible in hu man affairs, but this hand itself has a shadow which conceals what it accomplishes. All that could then be seen of the French Revolution announced all that was great in this world, the advent of a new idea in human kind, the democratic idea, and afterwards democratic government. This idea was an emanation of Christian ity. Christianity, finding men in serfage and degraded all over the earth, had arisen on the fall of the Roman Empire, like a mighty vengeance, though under the aspect of a resignation. It had proclaimed the three words which, eighteen hundred years afterwards, were re-echoed by French philosophy \u2014 liberty, equality, fra ternity \u2014 amongst mankind. \" The French Revolution was in its essence a sublime and impassioned spirituality. It had a divine and uni versal ideal. This is the reason why its passion spread beyond the frontiers of France. Those who limit, muti late it. It was the accession of three moral sovereignties, \u2014 the sovereignty of right over force, the sovereignty of intelligence over prejudices, the sovereignty of people over governments. Revolution in rights ; equality. Rev olution in ideas; reasoning substituted for authority. 1 Michelet's French Revolution,"], [28, "6 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Revolution in facts ; the reign of the people. A gospel of social rights, a gospel of duties, a charter of hu manity. \" France declared itself the apostle of this creed. In this war of ideas, France had allies everywhere, and even on thrones themselves. \" Seditions are but the angry workings of the people ; revolutions are the ideas of the epoch. Ideas begin in the head of the nation. The French Revolution was a generous thought of the aristocracy. This thought fell into the hands of the people, who framed of it a weapon against the noblesse, the throne, and religion. The philosophy of the salons became revolt in the streets; nevertheless, all the great houses of the kingdom gave apostles to the first dogmata of the Revolution ; the States-General, the ancient theatre of the triumphs of the higher nobility, had tempted the ambition of their heirs, and they had marched in the van of the reformers. The Montmorencies, Noailles, La Rochefoucaulds, Cler mont Tonnerres, Lally Tollendals, D'Aiguillons, Lauzans, Montesquieu, Lameths, Mirabeaus, the Due d'Orleans, first prince of the blood, the Count de Provence, brother of the king, king himself afterwards as Louis XVIII. , had given an impulse to the boldest innovations. They had each borrowed their momentary popularity from principles easier to enunciate than restrain, and that popularity had nearly forsaken them all. So soon as these theorists of speculative revolution saw that they were carried away in the torrent, they attempted to ascend the stream from the source of which they had started ; some again surrounded the throne ; others had emigrated after the days of the 5th and 6th of October. Others, more firm, remained in their places in the National Assembly : they fought without a hope, but still de-"], [29, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 7 fended a fallen cause, gloriously resolute to maintain at least a monarchical power, and abandoning to the people, without a struggle, the spoils of the nobility and the Church. Amongst these were Oazales, the Abbe Maury, Malouet, and Clermont Tonnerre : they were the distin guished orators of this expiring party, known as the Right, in the National Assembly. \"Monarchical Europe was the handiwork of Catholi cism; politics were fashioned after the image of the Church ; authority was founded on a mystery. Rights came to it from on high, and power, like faith, was re puted divine. The obedience of the people was conse crated to it, and from that very reason inquiry was a blasphemy, and servitude a virtue. The spirit of phi losophy, which had silently revolted against this for three centuries, as a doctrine which the scandals, tyrannies, and crimes of the two powers belied daily, refused any longer to recognize a divine title in those authorities which denied reason and subjugated a people. So long as Catholicism had been the sole legal doctrine in Europe, these murmuring revolts of mind had not overset empires. They had been punished by the hands of rulers. Dun geons, inquisitions, fire, and faggot had intimidated rea son, and preserved the twofold dogma on which the two governments reposed. \" But printing, that unceasing outpouring of the human mind, was to the people a second revelation. Employed at first exclusively for the Church and for the propagation of ruling ideas, it had begun to sap them. The dogmata of temporal power and spiritual power, incessantly assailed by these floods of light, were soon shaken, first in the human mind, and afterwards in things, to the very foun dations. Gutenberg, in facilitating the communication of ideas, had assured the independence of reason. Every"], [30, "8 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. letter of this alphabet which left his fingers contained in it more power than the armies of kings and the thunders of pontiffs. He furnished mind with language. \" The empire of Catholic Christianity had undergone extensive dismemberments. Switzerland, a part of Ger- many, Holland, England, whole provinces of F ranee, had been drawn away from the centre of religious author- ity, and passed over to the doctrine of Protestantism. Divine authority attacked and contested in Catholicism, the authority of the throne remained at the mercy of the people. Philosophy, more potent than sedition, approached it with less respect, less fear. History had actually written of the weaknesses and crimes of kings. Public writers had dared to comment upon it, and the people to draw conclusions. Social institutions had been weighed by their real value for humanity. Minds the most devoted to power had spoken to sovereigns of duties, and to people of rights. The holy boldness of Chris- tianity had been heard even in the consecrated pulpit in the presence of Louis XIV. Bossuet had mingled his proud adulations to Louis XIV. with some of those austere warnings which console persons for their abase- ment. F^nelon, that evangelical and tender genius of the new law, had written his instructions to princes and his ' Telemachus ' in the palace of the king, and the cabinet of an heir to the throne. The political philosophy of Christianity \u2014 that insurrection of justice in favor of the weak \u2014 had been whispered by the lips of Louis XIV. into the ear of his grandson. Fenelon edu- cated another revolution in the Duke of Burgundy. This \u25a0the king perceived when too late. But the revolutionary policy was born there ; there the people read the pages of the holy archbishop; Versailles was destined to be, thanks to Louis XIV. and Fenelon, at once the palace of"], [31, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 9 despotism and the cradle of the Revolution. Montesquieu had sounded the institutions and analyzed the laws of the people. By classing governments he had compared them ; by comparing he passed judgment on them; and this judgment brought out, in its bold relief and con trast, on every page, right and force, privilege and equal ity, tyranny and liberty. \" Jean Jacques Rousseau, less ingenious, but more elo quent, had studied politics, not in the laws, but in nature. Rousseau was the ideal of politics, as Fencton was the ideal of Christianity. \"Voltaire had the genius of criticism, \u2014 that power of raillery which withers all that it overthrows. His disciples filled courts, academies, and salons; those of Rousseau grew visionary amongst the lower orders of society. The one had been the fortunate and elegant advocate of the aristocracy ; the other was the secret con soler and beloved avenger of the democracy. Voltaire's followers would have overturned altars ; those of Rous seau would have raised them. The one could have done without virtues and made arrangements with thrones ; the other had absolute need of a God, and could only have founded republics. From the end of the reign of Louis XIV. to the commencement of the reign of Louis XVI. nature had been prodigal of men to France. This brilliant array, continued by so many geniuses of the first order, from Corneille to Voltaire, from Bossuet to Rous seau, from F6n61on to Bernardin Saint Pierre, had accus tomed people to look toward France. The moral authority of the human mind was no longer at Rome. The stir, light, direction, were from Paris; the European mind was French.\" Michelet says : \" Montesquieu is the writer, the inter preter of Right ; Voltaire weeps and clamors for it ; and"], [32, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 10 Rousseau founds it. It was a grand moment, which found Voltaire overwhelmed by a new calamity, the dis aster of Lisbon, when, blinded by tears, and doubting Heaven, Rousseau comforted him, restored God to him, and upon the ruins of the world proclaimed the existence of Providence. \u00ab If Rousseau had spoken in the terms of Mirabeau, his language would not have taken effect. Necessities change the times. To a world ready to act, on the very day of action, Mirabeau said, ' Law is the sovereign of the world; you are the subjects of Law. . . .' To a world still slumbering, inert, feeble, and devoid of en ergy, Rousseau said, and said well, ' The general will is right and reason; your will is Law. Then arouse yourselves, ye slaves ! ' \" This it is which explains how a feeble breath from a manly breast, a simple melody arising from the heart of the poor musician, raised the dead. France is moved in her inmost soul. All Europe is changed by it. The vast German Empire rocks on her old foundations. They criticise, but obey. 'Mere sentimentality,' say they, with an attempt to smile. And yet these dream ers follow it. The very philosophers take, in spite of themselves, the simple path of the poor vicar of Savoy. Warmth and thrilling melody, such is the magic of Rousseau. His power, as it is in his ' Smile,' and the ' Contrat Social,' may be discussed and combated. But, by his ' Confessions ' and his ' Reveries,' by his weakness, he has vanquished us, and drawn tears from every eye.\" Such is the eulogistic picture of Rousseau given by the French historian Michelet. G. H. Lewes draws him with a much heavier touch. \"His ideas were often noble, grand, and tender ; his acts, degraded. He taught mothers by his eloquence to nurse their children, and"], [33, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 11 threw his own children into the foundling hospital. His sensibility led him to sympathize with whatever was beautiful ; his weakness and selfishness suggested acts which have left ineffaceable stains upon his memory. He was one of that class of men whose practice springs not from their precepts, in whom the unclouded intellect discerns and honors truth, while the will is too miserably weak to act the truth. He has had his acrid antagonists and his eloquent defenders. Are not both right \u2014 both wrong ? It is possible to draw, and truly draw, a fearful picture of one-half of this man, but such a one-sided view will never obtain general acceptance ; for many will deeply sympathize with what was noble in him, and impartial men will always proclaim it. Few read his works. That marvellous book, 'The Confessions,' will never indeed cease to find readers ; but while ' Emile ' and ' La Nouvelle Heloise,' from time to time tempt the adventurous, lured by celebrated titles, I do not believe that one student in fifty ever looks into the ' Discourse on the Inequality of Conditions ' or the ' Social Contract.' But these were his great revolutionary works.\" One of the most remarkable epochs in the history of France is that between 1745 and 1764. No period presents such striking contrasts. Though France lost her colonies and her marine, and was beaten in every quarter of the globe, yet she collected at Paris a bril liant galaxy of writers, whose ideas were destined to con trol the minds of Europe. Thiers says : \" Supreme authority was at first disputed by the vassals. This authority was afterwards divided among them, and constituted feudal anarchy; and at length it reverted to the throne, where it became con centrated into despotism under Louis XL, Richelieu, and Louis XIV. The French population had progressively"], [34, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 12 enfranchised itself by industry, the primary source of wealth and liberty. Though originally agricultural, it soon devoted its attention to commerce and manufac tures, and acquired an importance that affected the entire nation. Introduced as a supplicant into the States-General, it appeared there in no other posture than on its knees, in order to be grievously abused. In process of time, even Louis XIV. determined that he would have no more of these cringing assemblies ; and this he declared to the parliaments, booted and whip in hand. Thenceforth were seen, at the head of the State, a king clothed with a power ill defined in theory, but ab solute in practice ; grandees who had relinquished their feudal dignity for the favor of the monarch, and who disputed by intrigue what was granted to them out of the substance of the people ; beneath them an immense population, having no other relation to the court and the aristocracy than habitual submission and the payment of taxes. \" Between the court and the people were parliaments invested with the power of administering justice and registering the royal decrees. Authority is always dis puted. If not in the legitimate assemblies of the nation, it is contested in the very palace of the prince. It is well known that the parliaments, by refusing to register the royal edicts, rendered them ineffective. This ter minated in a ' bed of justice ' and a 'concession' when the king was weak, but in entire submission when the king was powerful. Louis XIV. had no need to make concessions, for in his reign no parliament dared remon strate. He drew the nation along in his train, and it glorified him with the prodigies which itself achieved in war and in the arts and sciences. The subjects and the monarch were unanimous, and their actions tended"], [35, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 13 towards one and the same point. But no sooner had Louis XIV. expired, than the Regent afforded the parlia ments occasion to revenge themselves for their long nullity. \" The will of the monarch, so profoundly respected in his lifetime, was violated after his death, and his last testament was cancelled. Authority was then thrown into litigation, and a long struggle began between the parliaments, the clergy, and the court, in sight of a nation worn out with long wars, and exhausted by sup plying the extravagance of its rulers, who gave them selves up alternately to pleasure and arms. Till then it had displayed no skill but for the service and the gratification of the monarch ; it now began to apply its intelligence to its own benefit and the examination of its interests. \"From the theatre and the pulpit French genius turned to moral and political sciences ; all then be came changed. Picture to yourself, the usurpers of all the national rights quarrelling during a whole century, about a worn-out authority ; the parliaments perse cuting the clergy; the clergy persecuting the parlia ments ; the latter disputing the authority of the court ; the court, careless and calm amid this struggle, squan dering the substance of the people in the most profligate debauchery ; the nation, watching these disputes, arming itself with the allegations of one party against the other, deprived of all political action, dogmatizing boldly and ignorantly, because it was confined to theories ; aspiring, above all, to recover its rank in Europe, and offering in vain its treasure and its blood to regain a place which it had lost through the weakness of its rulers. Such was the eighteenth century.\" The French historian, Mignet, says: \"The French"], [36, "14 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Revolution not only modified the political power, but it entirely changed the internal existence of the nation. The forms of the society of the Middle Ages still re mained. The land was divided into hostile provinces ; the population into rival classes. The nobility had lost all their powers, but still retained all their distinctions. The people had no rights, royalty no limits. France was in an utter confusion of arbitrary administration, of class legislation, and special privileges to special bodies. For these abuses the Revolution substituted a system more conformable with justice and better suited to our times. It substituted law in the place of arbitrary will, equality in that of privilege ; delivered men from the distinctions of classes, the land from the barriers of province, trade from the shackles of corporations and fellowships, agri culture from feudal subjection and the oppression of tithes, property from the impediment of entails, and brought everything to the condition of one state, one system of law, one people. \" In order to effect such a mighty reformation as this, the Revolution had many obstacles to overcome, involving transient excesses with durable benefits. The privileged sought to prevent it ; Europe to subject it ; and thus forced into a struggle, it could not set bounds to its efforts or moderate its victory. Resistance from within brought about the sovereignty of the multitude, and aggression from without, military domination. Yet the end was attained in spite of anarchy and in spite of des potism : the old society was destroyed during the Revo lution, and the new one became established under the Empire. \" When a reform has become necessary, and the mo ment for accomplishing it has arrived, nothing can pre vent it ; everything furthers it. Happy were it for men,"], [37, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 15 could they then come to an understanding. If the rich would resign their superfluity, and the poor content themselves with receiving what they really needed, revo lutions would then be quietly effected, and the historian would have no excesses, no calamities, to record; he would merely have to display the transition of humanity to a wiser, freer, and happier condition. But the annals of nations have not as yet presented any instance of such prudent sacrifices. As yet there has been no sovereign but force. \" From Philip Augustus to Louis XL the object of all the efforts of the nobility was to preserve their own power ; from Louis XL to Louis XIV., to become the ministers of that of royalty. The Fronde was the last campaign of the aristocracy. Under Louis XIV. abso- lute monarchy definitively established itself, and domi- nated without dispute. The government of France, from Louis XIV. to the Revolution, was more arbitrary than despotic, for the monarchs had much more power than they exercised. The barriers that opposed the encroach- ments of this immense authority were exceedingly fee- ble. The crown disposed of persons, by lettres-de-cachet, of property by confiscation, of the public revenue by extravagance. Certain bodies, it is true, possessed means of defence, which were termed privileges, but these privileges were rarely respected. The parliament had that of ratifying or of refusing an impost, but the king could compel its assent by a lit-de-justice, and punish its members by exile. The nobility were exempt from taxation ; the clergy were entitled to the privilege of taxing themselves, in the form of free gifts. Some provinces enjoyed the right of compounding the taxes, and others made the assessment themselves. Such were the trifling liberties of France, and even these all turned"], [38, "16 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to the benefit of the privileged classes, and to the detri ment of the people. \" And this France, so enslaved, was moreover miserably organized ; the excesses of power were still less endur able than their unjust distribution. The nation, divided into three orders, which subdivided themselves into several classes, was a prey to all attacks of despotism and all the evils of inequality. The nobility were sub divided into courtiers, living on the favors of the prince \u2014 that is to say, on the labor of the people, and whose aim was governorships of provinces or elevated ranks in the army ; ennobled parvenus, who conducted the interior administration, and whose object was to obtain comptrollerships, and to make the most of their places while they held them, by jobbing of every de scription ; legistes, who administered justice, and were alone competent to perform its functions ; and landed proprietors, who oppressed the country by the exercise of those feudal rights which still survived. The clergy were divided into two classes : the one destined for the bishoprics and abbeys, and their rich revenues ; the other for the apostolic function and its poverty. The third estate, ground down by the court, humiliated by the nobility, was itself divided into corporations, which, in their turn, exercised upon each other the evil and the contempt they received from the higher classes. It pos sessed scarcely a third part of the land, and this was burdened with the feudal rents due to the lords of the manor, tithes to the clergy, and taxes to the king. In compensation for all these sacrifices, it enjoyed no politi cal right, had no share in the administration, and was admitted to no public employment. \"Louis XIV. wore out the mainspring of absolute monarchy by too protracted tension and too violent use."], [39, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 17 Fond of sway, rendered irritable by the vexations of his youth, he quelled all resistance, forbade every kind of opposition, \u2014 that of the aristocracy, which manifested itself in revolt, \u2014 that of the parliaments, displayed by remonstrance, \u2014 \u25a0 that of the Protestants, whose form was a liberty of conscience which the Church deemed heretical, and royalty considered factious. Louis XIV. subdued the nobles, by summoning them to his court, where favors and pleasures were the compensation for their depend ence. Parliament, till then the instrument of the crown, attempted to become its counterbalance, and the prince haughtily imposed upon it a silence and submission of sixty years' duration. At length the revocation of the Edict of Nantes completed this work of despotism. The immense power of Louis XIV. was exercised, internally, against the heretics ; externally, against all Europe. Oppression found ambitious men to counsel it, dragoons to serve, and success to encourage it ; the wounds of France were hidden by laurels, her groans were drowned in songs of victory. But at last the men of genius died, the victories ceased, industry emigrated, money disap peared ; and the fact became evident that the very suc cesses of despotism exhaust its resources and consume its future ere that future has arrived. \" The death of Louis XIV. was the signal for a reac tion. There was a sudden transition from intolerance to incredulity, from the spirit of obedience to that of dis cussion. Under the Regency, the third estate acquired in importance, by their increasing wealth and intelli gence, all that the nobility lost in consideration and the clergy in influence. Under Louis XV. the court carried on ruinous wars attended with little glory, and en- gaged in a silent struggle with opinion, in an open one with the parliament. Anarchy crept into its bosom, the"], [40, "18 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. government fell into the hands of royai favorites, power was completely on the decline, and the opposition daily made fresh progress. \" The parliaments had undergone a change of position and of system. Royalty had invested them with a power which they now turned against it. No sooner had the ruin of the aristocracy been accomplished by the com bined efforts of the parliament and of royalty, than the conquerors quarrelled, according to the common practice of allies after a victory. Royalty sought to destroy an instrument that became dangerous when it ceased to be useful, and the parliament sought to govern royalty. This struggle, favorable to the monarch under Louis XIV., of mixed reverses and success under Louis XV., only ceased with the Revolution. A new power had arisen, \u2014 that of opinion, \u2014 which, though not recognized, was nevertheless influential, and whose decrees were beginning to assume sovereign authority. The nation, hitherto a nonentity, gradually asserted its rights, and without sharing power influenced it. The epoch at which the third estate was to share the sway had at last arrived. In times of feudal tyranny it had served the kings against the nobles ; when ministerial and fiscal despotism prevailed, it assisted the nobles against the kings ; but, in the first instance, it was nothing more than the servant of the crown ; in the second, than that of the aristocracy. The struggle took place in a sphere, and on the part of interests with which it was reputed to have no connection. When the nobles were definitively beaten in the time of the Fronde, it laid down its arms, a clear proof how secondary was the part it had played. \" At length, after a century of absolute submission, it reappeared in the arena, but on its own account. The court was to have another antagonist. The third estate,"], [41, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 19 which increased daily in strength, wealth, intelligence, and union, was destined to combat and to displace it. The parliament did not constitute a class, but a body ; and in this new contest, while able to aid in the displace ment of authority, it could not secure it for itself. \"The court had favored the progress of the third estate, and had contributed to the development of one of its chief means of advancement, \u2014 its intelligence. The most absolute of monarchs aided the movement of mind, and, without intending it, created public opinion. By encouraging praise, he prepared the way for blame ; for we cannot invite an examination in our favor without undergoing one afterwards to our prejudice. When the songs of triumph and adulation were exhausted, accusa tion began, and the philosophers of the eighteenth cen tury succeeded to the literati of the seventeenth. Every thing became the object of their researches and reflections, \u2014 governments, religion, abuses, laws. They proclaimed rights, laid bare men's wants, denounced injustice. A strong and enlightened public opinion was formed, whose attacks the government was forced to endure without venturing to attempt its suppression. It even con verted those whom it attacked ; courtiers submitted to its decisions from fashion's sake ; power from neces sity ; and the age of reform was ushered in by the age of philosophy, as the latter had been by the age of the fine arts. Such was the condition of France when Louis XVI. ascended the throne on the 11th of May, 1774. Finances, whose deficiencies neither the restorative ministry of Cardinal de Fleury, nor the bankrupt ministry of the Abbe\" Terray had been able to make good, author ity disregarded, intractable parliaments, an imperious public opinion, \u2014 such were the difficulties which the new reign inherited from its predecessors.\""], [42, "20 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Taine thus comments upon the beginnings of anarchy and the approaching revolution : \" During the night of July 14-15, 1789, the Due de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt caused Louis XVI. to be aroused to inform him of the taking of the Bastile. ' It is a revolt, then ! ' exclaimed the king. 'Sire,' replied the duke, 'it is a revolution!' The event was even more serious. Not only had power slipped from the hands of the king, but it had not fallen into those of the Assembly ; it lay on the ground ready to the hands of the unchained populace, the violent and over-excited crowd, the mobs which picked it up like some weapon that had been thrown away in the street. In fact, there was no longer any government ; the artifi cial structure of human society was giving way entirely ; things were returning to a state of nature. This was not a revolution, but a dissolution. \"Two causes excite and maintain the universal up heaval. The first one is a famine, which, being constant, lasting for ten years, and aggravated by the very disturb ances which it excites, bids fair to inflame the popular passions to madness, and change the whole course of the Revolution into a series of spasmodic stumbles. In 1788, a year of severe drought, the crops had been poor ; in addition to this, on the eve of the harvest, a terrible hail-storm burst over the region around Paris, from Normandy to Champagne, devastating sixty leagues of the most fertile territory, and causing damage to the amount of one hundred millions of francs. Winter came on, the severest that had been seen since 1709. After the spring of 1789 the famine spread everywhere, and it increased from month to month like a rising flood. In vain did the government order the farmers, proprietors, and corn-dealers to keep the markets supplied ; in vain did it double the bounty on importations, resort to all"], [43, "LOUIS XVI."], [44, ""], [45, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \u25a0x sorts of expedients, involve itself in debt, and expend over forty millions of francs to furnish France with wheat. In vain did individuals, princes, noblemen, bish ops, chapters, and communities multiply their charities ; the Archbishop of Paris incurring a debt of four hun dred thousand livres ; one rich man distributing forty thousand francs the morning after the hail-storm ; and a convent of Bernardins feeding twelve hundred poor persons for six weeks. All was not sufficient. Neither public measures nor private charity could meet the over whelming need. In Normandy, where the last commer cial treaty had ruined the manufacture of linen and lace trimmings, forty thousand workmen were out of employ ment.\" Arthur Young, who was travelling through France at this time, heard of nothing but the dearness of bread, and the distress of the people. He, an eye witness, thus describes the dearth : \" Every baker's shop was surrounded by a crowd, to which bread was distributed with the most grudging economy. This bread was generally blackish, earthy, and bitter, produc ing inflammation of the throat and stomach. T have seen flour of detestable quality at the military school and at other dep6ts. I have seen portions of it yellow in color, with an offensive smell ; some forming blocks so hard that they had to be broken into fragments by repeated blows of a hatchet. For my own part, wearied with the difficulty of procuring this poor bread, and disgusted with that offered to me at the table-d'hote, I avoided this kind of food altogether. In the evening I went to the Cafe du Caveau, where, fortunately, they were kind enough to reserve for me two of those rolls which are called flutes, and this is the only bread I have eaten for a week at a time. But this resource is only for the rich."], [46, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 22 As for the people, to get bread fit for dogs, they must stand in a line for hours, \u2014 and here they fight for it. They snatch food from one another. There is no more work to be obtained ; the work-rooms are deserted. Often, after waiting a whole day, the workman returns home empty-handed, and when he does bring back a four-pound loaf, it costs him three francs, twelve sous; that is, twelve sous for the bread, and three francs for the lost day.\" Regarding such a spectacle, Taine says : \" In this long line of unemployed, excited men, swaying to and fro before the shop door, dark thoughts are fermenting : ' If the bakers find no flour to-night to bake with, we shall have nothing to eat to-morrow.' An appalling idea, in presence of which the whole power of the government is not too strong ; for to keep order in the midst of famine, nothing avails but the sight of an armed force, resolute and threatening. Under Louis XIV. and Louis XV. there had been even greater hunger and misery ; but the outbreaks, which were roughly and promptly put down, were only partial and passing disorders. Some rioters were at once hanged, and others were sent to the galleys ; the peasant or the workman, convinced of his impotence, at once returned to his stall or his plough. When a wall is too high, one does not even think of scaling it. But now the wall is cracking, \u2014 all its cus todians, the clergy, the nobles, the third estate, men of letters, the politicians, and even the government itself, making the breach wider. Hope steals through this opening like a beam of light, and gradually finds its way down to the depths below.\" And now more surprising still, not only do the people catch the rays of this beam of hope, but they are more over invited to speak out, to make known th^ir wants,"], [47, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 23 with promises that relief shall be forthcoming Their ideas are dim upon the subject, not clearer than those of the poor peasant girl, who replied to a questioning stranger: \"Something was to be done by some great folks for such poor ones, but she did not know who, or how \" ; but this thought once implanted in the minds' of the twenty-five millions, begins to work. Hunger lights the match, hope fans the flame, and lo! a mighty con- flagration will ere long be sweeping through the land. But none of the historians touch this subject with so keen an analysis and graphic a style as Carlyle. Into his terse sentences are packed volumes of truth, made all the more forceful by the undertone of cutting satire. \" And so, in the midst of confusions and unutterable incongruities (as all growth is confused), did this of Royalty, with Loyalty environing it, spring up, and grow mysteriously, subduing and assimilating (for a principle of life was in it), till it also had grown world- great, and was among the main Facts of our modern ex- istence. Such a Fact, that Louis XIV., for example, could answer the expostulatory Magistrate with his ' L'Etat! c'est moi ! [the State! i\" am the State!]' and be replied to by silence and abashed looks. So far had ac- cident and forethought, had your Louis Elevenths, with the leaden Virgin in their hatband, and torture-wheels and conical oubliettes (man-eating) under their feet ; your Henri Fourths, with their prophesied social millennium, ' when every peasant should have his fowl in the pot ' ; and on the whole, the fertility of this most fertile Existence (named of Good and Evil), brought it in the matter of Kingship. Wondrous ! Concerning which may we not again say, that in the huge mass of Evil, as it rolls and swells, there is ever some Good working im prisoned ; working towards deliverance and triumph ?"], [48, "24 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" Ever since that period of the Fronde, the Noble has changed his fighting sword into a court rapier, and now loyally attends his king as ministering satellite ; divides the spoil, not now by violence and murder, but by solicit ing and finesse. These men call themselves supports of the throne; singular gilt pasteboard caryatides in that singular edifice! For the rest, their privileges every way are now much curtailed. That Law authorizing a Seigneur, as he returned from hunting, to kill not more than two serfs, and refresh his feet in their warm blood, has fallen into perfect desuetude, and even into incredi bility. No Charolois, for these last fifty years, though never so fond of shooting, has been in use to bring down slaters and plumbers, and see them roll from their roofs, but contents himself with partridges and grouse. Close viewed, their industry and function is that of dressing gracefully and eating sumptuously. As for their de bauchery and depravity, it is perhaps unexampled since the era of Tiberius and Commodus. These people, of old, surely had virtues, uses, or they could not have been there. Nay, one virtue they are still required to have (for mortal man cannot live without a conscience), the virtue of perfect readiness to fight duels. \" Remark, meanwhile, how from amid the wrecks and dust of this universal Decay, new Powers are fashioning themselves, adapted to the new time and its destinies. Besides the old Noblesse \u2014 originally of Fighters \u2014 there is a new recognized Noblesse of Lawyers, whose gala day and proud battle-day even now is. An unrecognized Noblesse of Commerce, powerful enough, with money in its pocket.

The Louis that was, lies forsaken, a mass of abhorred clay, abandoned ' to some poor persons, and priests of the Chapelle Ardente,' who make haste to put him ' in two lead coffins, pouring in abundant spirits of wine.' The new Louis, with his Court, is rolling towards Choisy ; the royal tears still flow ; but a word mispro nounced by Monseigneur d'Artois sets them all laugh ing, and they weep no more.

Thus is our Era still to be named of Hope, though in the saddest sense, when there is nothing left but Hope.\" The French historian Michelet says : \" When young French Liberty first opened her eyes to the light, and uttered that earliest cry which transports every new creature, \u2014 ' I am !

But others also were seen in mourning, crowned with cypress ; they were carrying a table covered with crape, and under the crape a veiled sword, that of the Law ! A touching image !

And the period of violence, the period of sanguinary deeds, into which danger afterwards thrust it, had for actors but an inconsiderable, an extremely small number of men. That is what I have found established and verified, either by written testimony, or by such as I have gath ered from the lips of old men.

The most powerful minds in the world work hard to build up their altar ever higher and higher ; they would like to raise it to heaven.

Kings themselves are in her train: Frederick, Catherine, Joseph, Leopold. All appear converted, all wish for the Revolution; though every one, it is true, wishes it, not for himself, but for others. The nobility would willingly make it against the clergy, and the clergy against the nobility. \" Turgot is the touch-stone for all : he summons them to say whether they wish truly to amend; they all unanimously answer: 'No, let what ought to be done, be done ! ' Meanwhile, I see the Revolution everywhere, even in Versailles. All admit it to a certain limit, where it will not hurt them : Louis XVI. as far as the plans of Fen61on and the Duke of Burgundy, and the Count d'Artois as far as Figaro ; he forces the king to allow the trying drama to be played. The queen wishes for the Revolution, at least in her palace, for the piarvenus. Necker, the borroiver, himself discredits his loans by publishing the misery of the monarchy. A revolution naive by publicity, he believes he is so by his little provincial assemblies, wherein the privileged are to say what must be taken from the privileged. \" The witty Calonne comes next, and being unable to glut the privileged even by breaking into the public treasury, he takes his course, accuses them, and hands them over to the hatred of the people. He has accom plished the Revolution against the notables ; Lomenie, a philosophical priest, accomplishes it against the parlia ments. Calonne said admirably, when he avowed the deficit, and pointed to the yawning gulf : ' What remains to fill it with ? The Abuses ! ' \" That seemed clear to everybody ; the only thing"], [62, "36 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. obscure was whether Calonne did not speak in the name of the very Prince of abuses, of him who sustained all others, and was the key-stone of the whole wretched edi fice ? In two words, was Royalty the support or the remedy of those abuses denounced by the king's own creature ? \" That the clergy was an abuse, and the nobility an abuse, seemed but too evident. The only obscure ques tion was that of Royalty ; a question not of mere form, but a fundamental, intimate question more vital than any other in France ; a question not only of politics, but of love and religion. No people ever loved their kings so dearly. Read the foreign travellers of the last two centuries ; you behold them stupefied, when travelling through our plains, at their wretched appearance, at the sadness, the solitude, the miserable poverty, the dismal, naked, empty cottages, arid the starving, ragged popula tion. There they learned what man is able to endure without dying ; what nobody, neither the English, the Dutch, nor the Germans, would have supported. What astonishes them still more is the resignation of this people, their respect for their masters, lay or ecclesias tical, and their idolatrous attachment for their kings. \"It is difficult to describe properly the history of those times, as they are unmarked by rebellions. No people ever had fewer. This nation loved her masters ; she had no rebellion, nothing but a revolution. It is from their very masters, their kings, princes, ministers, prelates, magistrates, and intendants, that we may learn to what extremities the people were reduced. It is they who are about to describe the restraints in which the people were held. The mournful procession in which they all advance one after the other in order to recount the death of France is led by Colbert in 1681 : ' One can"], [63, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 37 go on no longer,' says he, and then he dies. They do go on, however, for they expel half a million of industrious men about 1685, and kill still more in a thirty-years war. But, good God ! how many more die of misery ! \" As early as 1698 the result is visible. The intend ants themselves, who create the evil, reveal and deplore it. In the memorials which they are asked to give for the young Duke of Burgundy, they declare that such a province has lost a quarter of its inhabitants ; another, a third ; and another, the half. The population is not permanently increased. The children are all wreak and sickly, and unable to live. \" That deplorable period of 1698 becomes an object of regret. ' Then,' says Boisguillebert, a magistrate, 'there was still oil in the lamp. In 1707 it goes out for want of nourishment ; ' and he adds a threatening sentence, ' The trial will now be between those who pay and those whose only business is to receive.' \"The preceptor to the grandson of Louis XIV., the Archbishop of Cambrai, is not less revolutionnaire than this Norman magistrate. ' The people no longer live like men,' he writes ; ' it is no longer safe to rely upon their patience. The old machine will break up at the first shock. We dare not look upon the state of exhaustion which we have now attained ; all we can do is to shut our eyes, open our hands, and go on taking.' \" Louis XIV. dies at last, and the people thank God. Happily, we have the regent, that good Duke of Orleans, who, if F6n61on still lived, would take him for his coun sellor; he prints Telemachus ; France shall be a Salen tum. No more wars. We are now the friends of Eng land ; we give up to her our commerce, our honor, nay, even our state secrets. Who would believe that in the bosom of peace this amiable prince, in only seven years,"], [64, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 38 finds means to add to the two billions and a half of debts, left by Louis XIV., seven hundred and fifty millions (of francs) more ? The whole debt in paper. \" ' If I were a subject,' he used to say, ' I should most certainly revolt.' And when he was told that a disturb ance was about to take place, ' The people are right,' said he ; ' they are good-natured fools to suffer so long.' Fleury is as economical as the regent was lavish. Does France improve ? I doubt it when I see that the bread presented to Louis XV. as the bread that the people ate is bread made of fern. The Bishop of Chartres told him that in his diocese the men browsed with the sheep. What is, perhaps, still stronger, M. d'Argenson, a min ister, speaking of the sufferings of those times, con trasts them with the good time. Imagine which : That of the regent and the duke, \u2014 the time when France, exhausted by Louis XIV., and bleeding at every pore, sought a remedy in a bankruptcy of more than three billions. \"Everybody sees the crisis approaching. Fenedon says, so early as 1709, ' The old machine will go to pieces at the first shock.' It does not break up yet. Then Madame de Chateauroux, about 1742, ' I see plainly that there will be a general overthrow if no remedy be used.' Yes, Madame, everybody sees it, \u2014 the king and your succes sor, Madame de Pompadour, as well as the economists, the philosophers, foreigners, everybody. All wonder at the longanimity of this people ; France is like Job sitting among the nations. 0 meekness ! 0 patience ! Walpole laughs at it, but I mourn over it. That unfortunate peo ple still love, still believe, are obstinate in hoping. It is ever waiting for succor from its god-king. Ridiculous, yet affecting idolatry ! What will this god-king do? He possesses neither the firm will, nor the power, perhaps,"], [65, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 39 to cure the deeply-rooted, inveterate, universal evil now consuming, parching, famishing the community, draining its life's blood from its veins, from its very heart. \"The evil consists in this, that the nation, from the highest to the lowest, is organized so as to go on pro ducing less and less, and paying more and more. She will go on declining, wasting away, giving her blood, her marrow ; and there will be no end to it till, having reached the last gasp, and just expiring, the convulsion of the death-struggle arouses her and raises that pale feeble body once more. Feeble ? Grown strong perhaps by fury ! \" Let us examine these words, producing less and less. They are exact to the letter. As early as under Louis XIV. the excise (aides) already weighed so heavily that at Mantes, fitampes, and elsewhere, all the vines were plucked up. The peasant having no goods to seize, the exchequer can lay hold of nothing but the cattle ; they are gradually exterminated. The cultivation of corn, though extended in the seventeenth century by immense clearings of waste land, decreases in the eighteenth. The earth can no longer repair her generative strength. Not only does the land produce less, but it is less culti vated. In many places it is not worth while to cultivate it. Large proprietors, tired of advancing to their peas ants sums that never return, neglect the land which would require expensive improvements. The desert ex pands. The land, devoid of succor, of cattle, grows wild. Men, women, and children yoke themselves to the plough. They would dig the ground with their nails if our ancient laws did not, at least, defend the plough share. How can we be surprised that the crops should fail with such half-starved husbandmen, or that the land should suffer and refuse to yield ? The yearly produce"], [66, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 40 no longer suffices for the year. As we approach 1789 nature yields less and less. Liberty is not only the life of man, but also that of nature. \" In the eighteenth century the people no longer hoped for anything from the clergy or the nobility. But they still believed in the king. In 1744 Louis XV. is named the Well-beloved. Ten years pass. The same people believe that the well-beloved takes baths of human blood ; that, in order to renew his exhausted frame, he bathes himself in children's blood. One day when the police, according to their atrocious custom, were carrying off men, children wandering in the streets, and little girls, the mothers screamed, the people flocked together, and a riot broke out. From that moment the king never resided in Paris. He had a road to his palace made in haste which avoided Paris and enabled the king to escape the observation of his people. That road is still called Le Chemin de la Rivolte. \" These ten years, 1744-1754, are the very crisis of the century. The king, that god, that idol, becomes an object of horror. The dogma of the regal incarnation perishes irrecoverably. And in its place arises the sovereignty of mind. Montesquieu, Buffon, and Voltaire, in that short interval, publish their works ; Rousseau is just beginning his. It is the chimera of the philosophers and economists, of such men as Voltaire and Turgot, to accomplish the revolution by the king. Nothing is more curious than to behold this idol disputed, as it were, by both parties. The philosophers pull him to the right, the priests to the left. Who will carry him off? Women.\" Madame de Pompadour, followed by Madame du Barry, rules the king by turns, until Louis XV. sinks into his dishonored grave. In a year of scarcity, while hunting,"], [67, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 41 Louis XV. met in the forests a peasant carrying a bier. The king stopped the man, and curiously inquired, \" Of what did he die ? \" \" Of hunger,\" was the unexpected reply. \"That dead man is Ancient France, and that bier the coffin of the Ancient Monarchy. Therein are buried forever the dreams so fondly cherished, \u2014 pater nal royalty, the government of kings, the clemency of the monarch, and the charity of the priest, filial confi dence, implicit belief in the gods here below. \" I hear this exclamation escape from the bosom of ancient France, \u2014 a tender expression of intense love, \u2014 ' 0 my king ! ' This is no flattery. Louis XIV. when young, was truly loved by the people and La Valliere. At that time it was the faith of all. Even the priest seems to remove his God from the altar, to make room for the new god. The Jesuits banish Jesus from the door of their establishment to substitute Louis le Grand. I read on the vaults of the chapel at Versailles, ' In trabit templum suum dominator.' The words had not two meanings ; the court knew but one god. The Bishop of Meaux is afraid lest Louis XIV. should not have enough faith in himself : ' 0 kings, exercise your power boldly, for it is divine \u2014 ye are gods ! ' \"An astounding dogma, and yet the people were most willing to believe it. They suffered so many local tyran nies, that, from the most remote quarters, they invoked the distant god, the god of the monarchy. No evil is imputed to him ; if his people suffer any, it is because he is too high or too distant. ' If the king did but know ! ' they cry. \" This love for royalty during the earlier days of Louis XIV. was idolatry. The king's endeavors to do equal justice to all, to lessen the odious inequality of taxation, gained him the heart of the people. Royal justice was"], [68, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 42 blessed for its severity. The king appeared as terrible, in his Grands jours, as the Day of Judgment. \" Such confidence, and such love ! and yet all betrayed ! That well-beloved king was hardhearted towards his people. Search everywhere, in books, and pictures ; con template him in his portraits, not a motion, not a look, reveals the least emotion of the heart. The love of a whole people \u2014 that grand rarity, that true miracle \u2014 succeeded in making only of their idol a miracle of egotism. He took adoration at its word, and believed himself a God. A strange divinity, he contracted and stifled a world in one man, instead of extending and aggrandizing that man to the measure of a world. His whole world is Versailles.\"1 We must learn from Marshal Villars how the armies of Louis XIV. used to live. \" Several times we thought that bread would absolutely fail us ; then, by great efforts, we got together enough for half a day ; the next day is got over by fasting. When M. d'Artagnan marched, the brigades not marching were obliged to fast. Our sustenance is a miracle, and the virtue and firmness of our soldiers are marvellous. ' Panem nostrum quotidia num da nobis hodie,' say they to me as I pass through the ranks, after they have but the quarter and the half ration. I encourage them, and give them promises ; they merely shrug up their shoulders and gaze at me with a look of resignation that affects me. ' The marshal is right,' say they, ' we must learn to suffer sometimes.' \" Michelet again says : \"The eyes of men, open under Louis XV., were shut once more under Louis XVI. The hope of the people still clung to royalty. Turgot hoped, Voltaire hoped, that this poor young king, so ill-born and bred, would have desired to do good. He struggled, and 1 Michelet's French Revolution."], [69, "CAUSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 43 was dragged away. The prejudices of his birth and edu cation, even his hereditary virtues, hurried him to his ruin, \u2014 he is a sad historical problem! Honest men have excused him, and houest men have condemned him. Duplicity, mental reservations (but little surprising, no doubt, in a pupil of the Jesuit party), such were his faults ; and lastly, his crime, which led him to death, \u2014 his appeal to foreigners. With all that, let us not forget that he had been sincerely anti-Austrian and anti-Eng lish; that he had truly, fervently desired to improve our navy; that he had founded Cherbourg at eighteen leagues from Portsmouth ; that he helped to cut England in two, and set one part of England against the other. That tear which Carnot shed on signing his death-warrant remains for him in history. History, and even Justice, in judging him, will weep. \" Every day brings on his punishment. Let it suffice to say here that the best was the last, \u2014 great lesson of Providence ! so that it might appear plain to all, that the evil was less in the man than in the institution it self; that it might be more than the condemnation of the king, \u2014 the condemnation of ancient royalty. Louis XV. or Louis XVL, infamous or honest, the god is never theless still a man ; if he be not so by vice he is by virtue, by easy good nature. Human and feeble, incap able of refusing, of resisting; every day sacrificing the people to the courtiers, and, like the anathemas of the priests, damning the many, and saving his elect.

VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. Brief Outline of the Political Parties in France, during the Revolu- tion of 1789 to 1799. \u2014 The Notables. \u2014 States-General. \u2014 National Assembly. \u2014 Constituent Assembly. \u2014 Legislative Assembly. \u2014 Girondists, Jacobins, and Cordeliers. \u2014 The Convention. \u2014 The Republic proclaimed. \u2014 Formation of the Revolutionary Tribunal. \u2014 The Directory. \u2014 The Consulate. IN order to gain a clear idea of the French Revolution it is necessary to have a concise knowledge of the various parties which successively ruled France from the memorable Convocation of the Notables, in 1787, down to the time of the Consulate, in 1799. These may be thus briefly defined : The Assembly of the Notables, convoked by Louis XVI. on the 22d of February, 1787, was a ministerial body chosen by the government from the higher classes. It was composed entirely of privi leged persons, from the ranks of the nobility and clergy. The Notables gave way to the States-General, the con vocation of which was forced upon Louis by the clamor ous demands of the nation. The States-General were composed of three parties : the nobility, the clergy, and the Tiers Etat, or third estate, formed by representa tives of the people. The hostility displayed by the nobility and clergy towards the third estate, and the unflinching determination of the latter to uphold their rights, resulted in the Tiers Etat resolving themselves"], [71, "ASSEMBLY OF THE NOTABLES."], [72, ""], [73, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 45 into an assembly, and constituting themselves the Na tional Assembly. Into this Assembly the nobility and clergy reluctantly came, and the three parties were merged into one body, over which the king held a nom inal place, but in reality wielded but little power. The royal authority was lost, and henceforth the sovereignty of the people was the only real power in France. The following were the divisions of views and inter ests contained in the National Assembly : The Court had a party, composed of the privileged classes, who for a long time remained inactive in the disputes. This party had declared against the union of the three orders in one body. The nobility and higher clergy formed the right of the Assembly, and were in constant opposition to the commons. Maury and Cazales were their leaders ; the one represented the clergy, and the other the nobility. The Abb6 Maury spoke with the pugnaciousness of a soldier. No one could contradict oftener or more per tinaciously than he, or more flippantly substitute quota tions and sophisms for reasoning, or rhetorical phrases for real bursts of feeling. Cazales was the opposite of Maury. His eloquence was equally facile, and he always gave the best of reasons. His only fault was that of his position. Necker and the ministry formed also a party less numerous than the other. They were more moder ate in their sentiments. France was then divided be tween the privileged classes who opposed the revolu tion, and the people who desired it. Necker declared himself in favor of the English constitution. He had several adherents, and they formed afterwards the mo narchical party. Among them were Mounier, Lally-Tol lendal, and Clermont-Tonnerre. Their desire was to effect a revolution by compromise, and to provide France with a government similar to that of England."], [74, "46 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The remainder of the Assembly constituted the National Party. At this time, their leaders were Duport, Bar nave, and Lameth. As the National Assembly became merged into the Con stituent Assembly, so called, because the Constitution was formed by them, Sieyes and Mirabeau became the leading spirits. Mirabeau obtained the ascendancy in the tribune, while Sieyes was the ruling power in the committees. From the 5th and 6th of October, 1789, to the month of April, 1791, the National Assembly, known also as the Constituent Assembly, effected the re-organization of France. After the acceptation of the Constitution by the king, in September, 1791, the Con stituent Assembly pronounced its mission accomplished, and terminated its sittings. As a decision had been passed against re-election, the members of this Assembly could not form part of the succeeding one. This motion, that no deputy could be eligible to re-election was de creed in opposition to Mirabeau, and it also prohibited them from accepting any office offered them by the king during four years. It was this decree which prevented La Fayette from accepting the permanent command of the National Guards, and imposed Bailly's resignation of the mayoralty. The new Assembly opened its sessions on the 1st of October, 1791. It immediately declared itself the Na tional Legislative Assembly. As in the Constituent Assembly there was a Right, a Centre, and a Left, but the character of the various parties was somewhat changed. The Right, composed of absolute consti tutionalists, formed the Feuillant party. Its leaders were Dumas, Ramond, Vaublanc, Beugnot, and others. Through its former leaders, Barnave, Duport, and La meth, it held relations with the Court. The club of the"], [75, "MIRABEAU."], [76, ""], [77, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 47 Feuillants, and the bourgeoisie were its supporters. The National Guard, the army, and the constituted author ities, were favorable to it. But the municipality was under the sway of the Giron dists who formed the Left of the Legislative Assembly. The brilliant orators of the Gironde were its leaders. Among them were Vergniaud, Guadet, Gensonne, Is nard, and Brissot. Petion, afterwards mayor of Paris, was active with this party. In the Assembly, the ex treme of the Girondists were forming the nucleus of a party, afterwards the democratic faction. Chabot, Bazire, and Merlin, were the leaders of this division of the Left. Robespierre, Buzot, and Potion had been to the Left of the Constituent Assembly what these lead ers were to the Girondists in the Legislative Assembly. Robespierre now established his sway in the club of the Jacobins, after leaving the Assembly ; and Dan ton, Camille Desmoulins, and Fabre d'Eglantine, led the club of the Cordeliers, whose members were more ex treme than the Jacobins,, and were composed of the bourgeoisie. This faction was also aided by the brewer Santerre, who held great power in the faubourgs as leader of the populace. Several influential members of the Assembly, among whom were Bailly and La Fayette, founded the club of 1789. Mirabeau was a member of this club and that of the Jacobins at the same time. Some efforts were made to unite the club of 1789 with the Jacobins, but the former were too moderate in their views to assim ilate with the Jacobins. The club of the Cordeliers, so named because its members assembled in a chapel of the Cordelier Convent, was the only party with which the Jacobins were in sympathy. The Cordeliers were revolutionists, active as the Jacobins. But while the"], [78, "48 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Jacobins were politic and disciplined, the Cordeliers were tumultuous, extravagant, and fanatic. Marat, Ca mille Desmoulins, and a German, the Baron de Klootz, were leaders in this club. The Baron had assumed the name of Anacharsis, a philosopher of antiquity. Klootz was a sceptical fanatic; blasphemous in his harangues, and strange in his actions. One day, pretending to be the ambassador of the human race, who was organizing the States-General of the world, he led into the National Assembly a mob of people of all nationalities. The Jacobins and Cordeliers united in action for the same end. But the Cordeliers was only a Parisian party, whereas the Jacobin Society had organized clubs throughout France. In 1792, the Jacobins numbered, in towns and villages, two thousand four hundred clubs. Thus they became a vast power in the Revolution. The Centre of the legislative party was moderate, but it was won over to the strongest side and was swayed by the Left. Louis's ministry, in 1791, was composed of the minister of the marine, Lacoste ; of finance, Cla vieres ; of justice, Duranthon ; of war, De Grave, soon afterwards replaced by Servan ; of foreign affairs, Du mouriez ; and of the interior, Roland. The Court named this ministry, le Ministere Sans-Culotte. The first time Roland appeared at the palace with strings in his shoes and a round hat, contrary to etiquette, the master of ceremonies refused to admit him. Obliged, however, to give way, he said despairingly to Dumouriez, pointing to Roland, \" Ah, sir, \u2014 no buckles on his shoes.\" \"All is lost,\" replied Dumouriez, with an air of grave sympathy. After the deposition of the king, the Jacobins ob tained the controlling influence in the Assembly. The Girondists were weakened by their contentions with the"], [79, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 49 Feuillants, and after the memorable 10th of August, the king was imprisoned in the Temple, and the Commune rose into power. At the head of the Commune were Marat, Panis, Sergent, Dyplain, Lenfent, Jourdeuil, Col lot d'Herbois, Billaud Varennes, Tallien, and others ; but the chief leader of the party, at that time, was Dan ton. In September occurred the awful massacres in the prisons of Cannes, the Abbaye, La Conciergerie, La Force, and others. Mignet says of France at this period : \" If we were to present the picture of a state emerging from a great crisis, and were to say there were in this state an abso lute government whose authority has been restricted; two privileged classes which have lost their supremacy ; a vast population, already freed by the effect of civiliza tion and intelligence, but without political rights, and which have been obliged, by reason of repeated refusals, to gain these for themselves ; if we were to add, the government, after opposing this revolution, submitted to it, but the privileged classes constantly opposed it, \u2014 it might probably be concluded from these data. \" The government will be full of regret, the people will exhibit distrust, and the privileged classes will attack the new order of things, each in its own way. The nobility, unable to do so at home from its weakness there, will emigrate, in order to arouse foreign powers who will make preparations for attack ; the clergy, who would lose its means of action abroad, will remain at home, where it will seek out foes to the revolution. The people, threatened from without, in danger at home, irri tated against the emigrants who seek to arm foreign powers, against foreign powers about to attack its inde pendence, against the clergy who excite the country to insurrection, will treat as enemies clergy, emigrants,"], [80, "50 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. and foreign powers. It will require first, surveillance over, then the banishment of, the refractory priests, con fiscation of the property of the emigrants, war against coalesced Europe, in order to forestall it. \" The first authors of the Revolution will condemn such of these measures as shall violate the law ; the con tinuators of the Revolution will, on the contrary, regard them as the salvation of the country ; and discord will arise between those who prefer the constitution to the state, and those who prefer the state to the constitution. The Monarch, induced by his interests as king, his affec tions, and his conscience, to reject such a course of policy, will pass for an accomplice of the counter-revolution, because he will appear to protect it. The revolutionists will then seek to gain over the king by intimidation, and failing in this, will overthrow his authority. \"Such was the history of the Legislative Assembly. Internal disturbances led to the decree against the priests ; external threats, to that against the emigrants ; the coalition of foreign powers, to war against Europe ; the first defeat of our armies, to the formation of the camp of twenty thousand. The refusal of Louis XVI. to adopt most of these decrees, rendered him an object of suspicion to the Girondists ; the dissensions between the latter and the constitutionalists, who desired some of them to be legislators, as in time of peace, others, enemies, as in time of war, disunited the partisans of the Revolution. With the Girondists, the question of liberty was involved in victory, and victory in the de crees. The 20th of June was an attempt to force their acceptance ; but having failed in its effect, they deemed that either the crown or the Revolution must be re nounced, and this brought on the 10th of August. Thus, but for emigration which induced the war, but for the"], [81, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 51 schism which induced the disturbances, the king would probably have agreed to the constitution, and the revolu tionists would not have dreamed of the republic.\" On the 20th of September, 1792, the Convention con stituted itself, and began its deliberations on the 21st. In its first sitting it abolished royalty, and proclaimed the republic. On the 22d, it appropriated the Revolu tion to itself, by declaring it would not date from year IV. of Liberty; but from year I. of the French Republic. Events had compelled the Girondists to become republi cans. The Girondists, after the 10i7t os August, were, between the middle class and the multitude, what the monarchists, or the Mounier and Necker party had been, after the 2-ith of July, between the privileged classes and the bourgeoisie. The Girondists were now confronted in the Convention by the Mountain party, so called because they occupied the summit of the left benches, while the Girondists took the right. Nothing remained to the Girondists but the ministry, who, thwarted by the Commune, were powerless in Paris. The Moun taineers disposed of the effective force of the capital, held the public mind through the Jacobins, influenced the sections and faubourgs through the Sans-Culottes, and disposed of the insurrectionists by the municipality. Their two most powerful leaders were Robespierre and Marat. The trial and execution of Louis XVI. rendered the different parties irreconcilable, and increased the external enemies of the Revolution. The republicans had to con tend with all Europe. The Mountaineers, who then directed the popular movement, soon commenced the most bitter hostilities against the Girondists, who were at length proscribed, and several of them placed under arrest in their own houses."], [82, "52 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Mignet thus comments upon this event : \" Thus fell the Gironde party, a party rendered illustrious by great talents and great courage ; a party which did honor to the young republic by its horror of bloodshed, its hatred of crime and anarchy, its love of order, justice, and liberty ; a party unfitly placed between the middle class, whose revolution it had combated, and the multitude, whose government it rejected. Condemned to inaction, it could only render illustrious certain defeat by a cou rageous struggle and a glorious death. At this period, its fate might readily be foreseen ; it had been driven from post to post ; from the Jacobins by the invasion of the Mountain ; from the Commune by the outbreak of Po tion ; from the ministry by the retirement of Roland and his colleagues ; from the army by the defection of Dumouriez. The Convention alone remained to it ; there it threw up its intrenchments, there it fought, and there it fell. Its enemies employed against it, in turn, insur rection and conspiracy. The conspiracies led to the creation of the Commission of Twelve, which seemed to give a momentary advantage to the Gironde, but which only excited its adversaries the more violently against it. These aroused the people, and took from the Girondists, first, their authority, by destroying the Twelve ; then, their political existence, by proscribing their leaders. \" The consequences of this disastrous event did not answer the expectations of any one. The Dantonists thought that the dissensions of parties were at an end : civil war broke out. The moderate members of the coin mittes of public safety thought that the convention would resume all its power : it was utterly subdued.

Lastly, there was another party to be added to the parties defeated, and thenceforth hostile ; and as after the 10th os August, the republic had been opposed to the constitutionalists, after the 31st of May the Reign of Terror was opposed to the moderate party of the republic.\" The English government, seeing that Paris and the departments were distressed by famine, after the 31st of May and the 2d of June, pronounced all the ports of France in a state of blockade, and that all neutral ships attempting to bring a supply of provisions would be con fiscated. \" This measure, new to the annals of history, and destined to starve an entire people, three months afterwards originated the law of the Maximum. The situation of the republic could not be worse.\" The Convention was taken by surprise. It was disor ganized by its recent dissensions. The Mountaineers, now masters of the field, endeavored to secure the repub licans by decreeing the constitution. This constitution is known in history as the Constitution of 1793, in dis tinction to that formed by the Constituent Assembly, known as the Constitution of 1791. Now the bloody revolutionary tribunal began its awful reign under the leadership of Robespierre. The red guil lotine quickens its reeking knife. Queen, Girondists, Danton, and thousands more die upon the scaffold ; till at last the tyrant Robespierre perishes by the same in strument of horror, and the Reign of Terror comes to an end. With the fall of Robespierre and his confederates, the state of the republic was greatly changed. The Com mune was disorganized, and seventy-two of its insurgent members were sent to the scaffold. The Jacobin club was closed, and the faubourgs disarmed. A new constitution"], [86, "54 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. was decreed by the convention on the 22d of August, 1795. Mignet says of this constitution : \" It was the work of the moderate republican party; but as it restored the ascendency of the middle class, the royalist leaders thought that by it they might easily enter the legislative body and the government. \" This constitution was the best, the wisest, the most liberal, and the most provident that had as yet been established or projected ; it contained the result of six years' revolutionary and legislative experience. At this period, the Convention felt the necessity of organizing power and of rendering the people settled, while the first assembly, from its position, only felt the necessity of weakening royalty and agitating the nation. All had been exhausted from the throne to the people ; existence now depended on reconstructing and restoring order, at the same time keeping the nation in great activity. The new constitution accomplished this. It differed but lit tle from that of 1791, with respect to the exercise of sovereignty ; but greatly in everything relative to gov ernment. It confided the legislative power to two coun cils ; that of the Cinq-cents, and that of the Anciens; and the executive power to a Directory of five members. It restored the two degrees of elections destined to retard the popular movement, and to lead to a more enlightened choice than immediate elections. The wise but moder ate qualifications with respect to property, required in the members of the primary assemblies and the electoral assemblies, again conferred political importance on the middle class, to which it became imperatively necessary to recur after the dismissal of the multitude and the abandonment of the constitution of ' 93. \" In order to prevent the despotism of the servility of"], [87, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 55 a single assembly, it was necessary to place somewhere a power to check or defend it. The division of the legis lative body into two councils, which had the same ori gin, the same duration, and only differed in functions, attained the twofold object of not alarming the people by an aristocratic institution, and of contributing to the formation of a good government. The Council of Five Hundred, whose members were required to be thirty years old, was alone entrusted with the initiative and the discussion of laws. The Council of Ancients, composed of two hundred and fifty members, who had completed their fortieth year, was charged with adopting or reject ing them. \" The executive power was distinct from the councils, and no longer existed in the committees. Monarchy was still too much feared to admit of a president of the republic being named. They therefore confined them- selves to the creation of a Directory of five members, nominated by the Council of Ancients, at the recommen- dation of that of the Five Hundred. The directors might be brought to trial by the councils, but could not be dis- missed by them. They were entrusted with a general and independent power of execution, but it was wished also to prevent their abusing it, and especially to guard against the danger of a long habit of authority leading to usurpation. They had the management of the armed force and of the finances, the nomination of functiona- ries, the conducting of negotiations ; but they could do nothing of themselves ; they had ministers and generals, for whose conduct they were responsible. Each member was president for three months, holding the seals, and affixing his signature. Every year, one of the members was to go out. It will be seen by this account that the functions of royalty, as they were in 1791, were shared"], [88, "56 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. by the Council of Ancients, who had the veto, and the Directory, -which held the executive power. The Direc tory had a guard; a national palace, the Luxembourg, for a residence ; and a kind of civil list. The Council of the Ancients, destined to check the encroachments of the legislative power, was invested with the means of restraining the usurpations of the Directory ; it could change the residence of the councils and of the govern ment. \" The foresight of this constitution was infinite ; it prevented popular violence, the encroachments of power, and provided for all the perils which the different crises of the revolution had displayed. If any constitution could have become firmly established at that period, it was the Directorial Constitution. It restored authority, granted liberty, and offered the different parties an opportunity of peace, if each, sincerely renouncing exclu sive dominion, and satisfied with the common right, would have taken its proper place in the state. But it did not last longer than others, because it could not establish legal order in spite of parties.\" The Convention lasted three years, from the 21st of September, 1792, to October 26, 1795 (4th Brumaire, year IV.). During the first six months arose the strug gles between the Gironde and the Revolutionary party of the Mountain. The sway of the Mountain continued from the 31st of May, 1793, to the 9th Thermidor, year II. (July 27, 1794). After that time the Convention was influenced by the Committee of Public Safety, which first destroyed its old allies, the Commune and the Mountain, and then perished through its own divisions. From the 9th Thermidor to October, 1795, the Conven tion conquered the revolutionary and royalist parties, and endeavored to establish a moderate republic, in"], [89, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 57 opposition to both. This situation changed the revolu tion into a war, and the Assembly into a field of battle. \"Each party wished to establish its sway by victory, and to secure it by founding its system. The Girondist party made the attempt, and perished; the Mountain made the attempt, and perished ; the party of the Com mune made the attempt, and perished; Robespierre's party made the attempt, and perished. They could only conquer; they were unable to found a system. The property of such a storm was to overthrow everything that attempted to become settled. All was provisional : dominion, men, parties, and systems, because the only thing real and possible was war. A year was necessary to enable the conventional party, on its return to power, to restore the revolution to a legal position ; and it could only accomplish this by two victories \u2014 that of Prairial, and that of Vend\u00a3miaire. But the Convention, having then returned to the point whence it started, and hav ing discharged its true mission, which was to establish the republic after having defended it, disappeared from the theatre of the world, which it had filled with sur prise. A revolutionary power, it ceased as soon as legal order recommenced. \" The French Revolution, which had destroyed the old government, and thoroughly overturned the old society, had two wholly distinct objects ; that of a free constitution, and that of a more perfect state of civiliza tion. The six years we have just briefly sketched were the search for government by each of the classes which composed the French nation. The privileged classes wished to establish their Xgime against the court and the bourgeoisie by preserving orders and the States- General ; the bourgeoisie sought to establish its regime against the privileged classes and the multitude by the"], [90, "58 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Constitution of 1791 ; and the multitude wished to estab lish its regime against all the others by the Constitution of 1793. Not one of these governments could become consolidated, because they were all exclusive. But dur ing their attempts, each class, in power for a time, de stroyed of the higher classes all that was intolerant, or calculated to oppose the progress of modern civilization. \"When the Directory succeeded to the Convention, the struggle between the classes was greatly weakened. The higher ranks of each formed a party which still contended for the possession and for the form of gov ernment ; but the mass of the nation, which had been so profoundly agitated from 1789 to 1795, longed to become settled again, and to adjust itself according to the new order of things. This period witnessed the end of the movement for liberty, and the beginning of the move ment towards civilization. The Revolution now took its second character, its character of order, foundation, repose, after the agitation, the immense toil, and system of complete demolition of its early years. \" This second period was remarkable, inasmuch as it seemed a kind of abandonment of liberty. The different parties being no longer able to possess it in an exclusive and durable manner, became discouraged, and fell back from public into private life. This second period divided itself into two epochs : it was liberal under the Directory and at the commencement of the Consulate, and military at the close of the Consulate and under the Empire. The Revolution daily grew more materialized ; after having made a nation of sectaries, it made a nation of working-men, and then it made a nation of soldiers.\" Such is a brief outline of the governments of France from the beginning of the Revolution down to the Empire. And keeping this clearly in mind, one will"], [91, "VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES. 59 understand more definitely and comprehensively the various stages of the Revolution as they appear in their chronological order. As several important events of the Revolution are always referred to in history by their dates, rather than by names, it will be helpful to give a short list defining their meaning. In 1792, the French nation adopted a calendar pro- fessedly founded on philosophical principles. The first year of the era of the republic began at midnight, between the 21st and 22d of September, 1792 ; but its establishment was not decreed until the 4th Frimaire of the year II. (Nov. 24, 1793). The calendar existed until the 10th Nivose, year of the republic, XIV. (Dec. 31, 1805), when the Gregorian mode of calculation was re- stored by Napoleon I. According to the calendar of the republic, \u2014 The first month was Vendemiaire . . From Sept. 22 to Oct. 21. The second month was Brumaire . . From Oct. 22 to Nov. 20. The third month was Frimaire . . . From Nov. 21 to Dec. 20. The fourth month was Nivose . . . From Dec. 21 to Jan. 19. The fifth month was Pluviose . . . From Jan. 20 to Feb. 18.

FOR further conciseness regarding the events of the French Revolution the various important decrees of the Assembly, whether Constituent, Legislative, or of the Convention, are here gathered into one chapter, in"], [94, "62 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. their chronological order, that the narrative of the thrill ing scenes of the Revolution may not be marred by con stant references to the sittings of the Assembly, and the stormy debates which occurred therein. But as these stirring spectacles were so often consequent upon decrees enacted by the Assembly from time to time, it is neces sary that the decrees should be definitely stated. Up to the memorable 4th of August, 1789, the only decrees of consequence were the authorization of provisional taxes, declaring at the same time that all the taxes were ille gally inqjosed, the approval of the National Guard, and the adoption of the tri-color cockade. On the memorable night of August 4, 1789, as the Assembly were about to discuss a decree for repressing the outrages which had been committed in the provinces, the Vicomte de Noailles requested the privilege of speak ing, and stated that there was but one measure of restor ing the peace in the provinces, which had been occasioned by the oppression of exorbitant taxes. He moved that a decree be enacted equalizing the levy for all citizens, and authorizing the redemption of annual taxes and farm-rents upon the base of their average income, and the abolition, without redemption, of statute labor, mort main, and all personal servitude. The Due d'Aiguillon, grandson of a nephew of the great Richelieu, and son of that D'Aiguillon who had been minister under Louis XV., though he was the richest seigneur of France, and had the most to lose in the sup pression of feudal rights, warmly supported this motion of the Vicomte de Noailles. After these titled orators had proposed the abolition of feudal rights amid the acclamations of the Assembly, several of the orators of the people arose and offered suggestions. A farmer, in his peasant costume from"], [95, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 63 Lower Brittany, and others from the provinces, portrayed with earnest words the past indignities and oppression of the feudal regime. A provincial gentleman intimated the propriety of demanding that the court seigneurs, who had grown rich at the expense of the people, through royal favors, pen sions, and high positions, should be forced to bear their part, and a leading part, in the sacrifices about to be imposed upon the nobility. The Dues de Guiche and de Mortemart replied to his remarks that the parties he had mentioned were ready to renounce the king's bene fits, and share in the common burdens. A generous emulation in sacrifice now seized upon the members of the Assembly. Propositions succeeded each other with such great rapidity that the secretary had difficulty in writing them down in order. \"It was the spirit of disinterestedness, of chivalry, awaking in the final agonies of feudality.\" The Vicomte de Beauharnais, first husband of the Empress Josephine, moved that all citizens be considered eligible to all employments, and that there should be no distinction of class regarding penalties for all crimes. Another deputy demanded the abolition of seigneurial jurisdictions. One gentleman wittily remarked that he regretted having only a trifle to offer, but he would propose the suppression of the exclusive right in dove-cotes held by the possessors of fiefs. The Due de la Rochefoucauld recommended that they ameliorate the condition of slaves in the colonies and prepare them for liberation, while enfranchising serfs throughout the kingdom. A member of the Parliament of Paris proposed that justice be gra tuitous, and that the long-accustomed bribes should be suppressed. The president, Le Chapelier, invited the"], [96, "64 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. clergy to make known their sentiments. The bishops present approved of the suppression of feudal rights belonging to the ecclesiastics as well as to the laity. One of them suggested the abolition of the exclusive hunting rights enjoyed by the seigneurs. The cur6s offered to abandon their perquisites. The Assembly accepted the offer, but augmented the revenue fixed upon curates. As these perquisites were the only resource of many of the poor curates, their offer was very generous. The bishops had not offered to relinquish their tithes, and a gentleman among the nobility said laughingly to his neighbor, \" They take our hunting rights from us ; let us take their tithes from them.\" He accordingly proposed that the tithes be redeemable as well as the feudal claims, and the bishops dared not protest against the measure. \"After the privileges of the nobility and the clergy were immolated, those of the provinces and cities were also. The inequality had been everywhere ; it must no longer exist anywhere. The provincial deputies who had possessed the most privileges, and who had prized them most, set the example. The Dauphinois did what they had promised to do the year before, when the presi- dent, Le Chapelier, renounced, in the name of Brittany, all that separated it from the rest of France ; the depu- ties of Provence, those of Languedoc, those of all the provinces, did the same ; then the advocate, Tronchet, deputy of Paris, renounced for the capital its great privi- leges in the matter of imposts. Lyons, Marseilles, Bor- deaux, and other cities, followed the example of Paris.\"1 There was then a call for the suppression of the privi leges of freemen and tradesmen. This memorable sitting had commenced at eight o'clock in the evening, and before 1 Henri Martin's History of France.."], [97, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 65 two in the morning one of the greatest revolutions of the world had been consummated. \" There was now in France but one law, one nation, one family, one title that of French citizen. A single night had sufficed to overthrow the ancient oak of feudalism, whose branches covered the surface of the French Empire ; whose roots had exhausted, through so many ages, the juices of its soil, and smote with sterility the happy land of France. No people had given the example of a transport so gener ous and so sublime.\" But this patriotic enthusiasm was too fervid to be con tinued by vacillating human nature. Many of these magnanimous givers repented later of their generous sacrifices, and afterwards combated this revolution and the interests of that country to which they had promised their devotion. But the revolution which they had helped to inaugurate still went on in spite of their changing opinions, and history will keep the memory of their actions in that momentous night forever glorious. The equality of rights was established by the 4th of August ; but France must now enter upon a more diffi cult undertaking \u2014 the founding of liberty. The work of that August night was completed in the days which fol lowed. On the 11th of August, the final suppression of tithes was decreed, and the abolition of first-fruits, the tribute paid by France to the Pope, was also decreed. On the 10th of October, the Declaration of the Rights of Man was adopted. Before the Declaration of Rights was drawn up, debates had already arisen in the Assem bly, regarding the organization of the powers of the state. It was decided that the National Assembly should be permanent ; that is, that one Assembly should succeed another every two years. But the absorbing question was in relation to one or two Chambers."], [98, "66 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Mounier and other politicians desired for France a gov ernment similar to that of England. They proposed by the side of the House of Commons, a House of Peers also ; if not hereditary, as in England, that the members should be nominated by the king. Others, among them La Fayette and Condorcet, desired a government more like that of the United States, and suggested an elective and temporary Senate, besides a Chamber of Deputies. But the masses of the Revolutionary party objected to a second Chamber, thinking it would be a refuge for the nobility, the courtiers, and the bishops, who might en deavor to annul the measures of the Chamber of Depu ties. The decree in favor of a single Chamber was passed on September 9th, by a majority of over seven hundred. The discussion of another question caused great ex citement not only in Paris but throughout France. This was regarding the limit of the king's veto. \" Should the king have the power to oppose the resolutions of the Assembly, and to refuse his sanction to the laws which it had enacted ? \" The mass of the people perceived in the veto only one thing. The king could arrest the Revolution; the king could prevent the good the As sembly wished to do the people. One peasant said to another, \" The veto, do you know what that is ? \" \" No,\" was the answer. \" Ah, well, you have your porringer filled with soup ; the king says to you, ' Pour out the soup,' and you have to pour it out.\" This question became a burning one among all classes. In the Palais Royal, the great rallying-point for the most hot-headed Revolutionists, \" Down with the veto ! (p, bas le veto !) \" was the constant cry. On September 11th, the Assembly voted the condi tional veto. October 10th, in its promulgation of the laws, the Assembly suppressed the despotic formula in"], [99, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 67 which the king says : \" From our certain knowledge, full power, and royal authority, for such is our pleasure.\" The formula henceforth was to be : \" Louis, by the grace of God, and the law of the realm, king of France ; the National Assembly has decreed, and we will ordain as follows.\" This change intimated that the king was the chief of the French citizens, and no longer the feudal monarch who inherited the soil of France as a piece of property. The Assembly, on the 2d of November, upon Mira beau's proposition, declared that all ecclesiastical estates were at the disposition of the nation, \"which should provide for the cost of worship, the maintenance of its ministers, and the relief of the poor. The curates were to have a minimum of twelve hundred livres (about three thousand francs of to-day), besides lodging. Thus ended the order of the clergy ; the clergy was no longer an order in the State ; it was now only a class of citizens charged with the functions of worship.\" This decision was rendered in a hall of the Archbish opric of Paris, where the Assembly had temporarily es tablished itself on the 19th of October. It removed in December to the riding-school of the Tuileries, wdiich was upon the site of the present Rue Rivoli. On November 3d, when the estates of the clergy were placed at the disposal of the nation, a blow was struck at another order of the Ancient Regime. Upon a motion of Alexandre de Lameth, the Assembly decreed that the parliaments, which were then in their annual vacation, should remain in vacation until a new order. During vacation, the parliaments left in session a temporary Chamber, called the Chamber of Vacations. The Paris Chamber of Vacations secretly protested against this measure, a protest which, discovered later, condemned"], [100, "68 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to death its fourteen signers during the Reign of Terror. Other cities, bolder, sent violent protestations to the king. The parliaments of Rouen, Metz, Rennes, and Bordeaux, all made impotent resistance. A tribunal of cassation was created, which should rank above all other tribunals, and was charged with repeal ing judgments which had not been rendered in legal forms. The members of this Supreme Court were to be elected for four years by the assemblies of the vari ous Departements into which France was divided accord ing to the new territorial division. The new judiciary organization for civil justice was formed from March to November, 1790 ; for criminal justice, in September, 1791. The political hierarchy of the canton had been abol ished, but not that of the commune. It was therefore decreed that the communes should be administered by the municipalities chosen by legal voters, and these municipalities should also decide local affairs. The members for the Departements and districts were to be chosen for four years, and these administrations were to renew half their members every two years. \" Both administrations were to be divided into coun cils, holding a session each year, and into permanent directories, rendering an account of their proceedings to the councils. The council for each Departement was to consist of thirty-six members ; that of the Directory, of eight. The primary assemblies were to name an elector for every one hundred ' active citizens.' The active citizen was he who was twenty-five years old, had lived one year in the country, paid a direct tax amounting to three days' labor, and was not a hired servant. The tax was esti mated at three livres, representing seven or eight francs of our day. By this restriction of the suffrage, there remained four million two hundred thousand voters"], [101, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 69 in a population of from twenty-five to twenty-six millions. \" The king, as the executive power, received the right to suspend all local administration not in accordance with his orders given for the execution of the laws. This suspension was to be confirmed or abrogated by the National Assembly. On December 16, 1789, the Assem bly decreed that the active army should be recruited by voluntary enlistments. Behind this active army, the Assembly intended that the whole nation should remain armed, and form an immense reserve.\" 1 On December 24th, the Assembly declared Protestants eligible to rank and office. Another important decree ordered the publication of the famous Livre Rouge, or Red Book, in which were inscribed the pensions and gifts made to princes, courtiers, and favorites of the king. The publication of this Red Book occasioned great excitement. The expenses of the king and queen were found to have been moderate ; but the king's broth ers, and friends of the queen, and numbers of great fami lies, had received enormous sums. Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIIL, had received through Calonne fourteen millions of francs. In this Red Book also had been in scribed the pensions granted to the flatterers and favor ites of Louis XV. The cash orders, including all sorts of expenses, during the eight years of Calonne's admin istration, amounted to eight hundred and sixty million francs. No wonder Loustalot, editor of the popular Jour nal, \"Les Revolutions de Paris,\" declared, \"that since the publication of the Red Book the counter-revolution had become impossible.\" The next discussion opened in the Assembly was the following : \u2014 i Henri Martin."], [102, "70 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" Is the nation to delegate to the king the exercise of the right of making peace and declaring war ? \" This discussion occupied ten sittings. Mirabeau was on the side of the royal prerogative, and maintained with all his eloquence and ability that the right to declare war should be granted to the king. Barnave refuted with great success this formidable adversary. It was at length decided, however, by the majority, that war could be de clared only by a decree of the National Assembly issued upon the proposition of the king. On June 10, 1790, the Assembly granted to the king the amount named in the civil list as the sum the head of the State annually receives for his own expenses. Louis XVI. demanded twenty-five million francs, and a dower of four million francs a year for the queen, if she should survive him. These enormous sums were granted without discussion. On June 19, 1790, the Assembly decreed the abol ishment of all titles of nobility. \" The titles of Duke, Marquis, Count, etc., have no meaning, when there are no longer duchies, marquisates, or earldoms ; \" but the names of estates were also interdicted, as not being real family names, which would require that such men as M. de La Fayette should henceforth be called M. Motier, and M. de Mirabeau receive only the title of M. Riquetti. This decree was not rigorously enforced. The sum total of the annual public expenses was four hundred and twelve million francs. But beside the annual expenses of the State, there was an enormous debt of eight hundred and seventy-eight millions. Necker, since his return to the ministry of finance, had constantly borrowed money at the Caisse d'Escompte (Discount Bank), founded under Turgot. The bankers grouped round Necker for some time sustained the"], [103, ""], [104, ""], [105, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 71 credit of the Caisse, but when Necker had been obliged to draw ninety new millions this credit declined. It was necessary again to have recourse to the Caisse, and ask a new advance of eighty millions. The government had only one resource to save itself from bankruptcy ; this was to sell the estates of the crown and the former property of the clergy, which had now become the National Estates. As this sale could not be immediately realized, the Assembly decided upon the creation of negotiable bonds to the value of four hundred millions, issued upon the property which was to be put in the market. These bonds were called Assignats, and became quite famous. This paper-money vote of the Assembly had been pre ceded by sittings of extreme violence. The total of the annual sum set apart for the clergy was one hundred and thirty-three million francs. This large sum was to be reduced one-half by the extinctions of parishes. Materially, the clergy had nothing to com plain of. The curates gained largely by this measure ; but the bishops rebelled at being no longer great lorded proprietors. They cried out from the pulpits that relig ion was lost. The Assembly was urged to decree that the Catholic worship alone should be authorized; but they decreed instead that the question did not come within their juris diction. In April, 1790, the Assembly ordained the transfer of church property to the Departem,ents and dis tricts ; authorizing them to pay the salaries of the clergy, and provide for the expenses of worship. This measure occasioned great excitement. The Right of the Assembly signed a violent protest against this decision. Civil war existed in the army as well as among the people. There were various outbreaks. In Languedoc"], [106, "72 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the soldiers were for the Revolution and for the Prot estants, while the officers favored the counter-revolution. In other parts of France the soldiers fought against each other. There were riots at Marseilles, Montpellier, Va lence, and more violent outbreaks in Avignon and Nimes. Michelet says : \" Two monuments especially deserve to be the objects of a frequent pilgrimage \u2014 two oppo site and yet instructive monuments ; the one infamous, the other sacred. The infamous one is the palace of Avignon, the Babel of the popes, the Sodom of legates, that Gomorrah of cardinals ; a monstrous palace, cover ing the whole brow of a mountain with its obscene towers, the scene of lust and torture, where priests showed to kings that, in comparison to them, they were mere novices in the abominable arts of sensuality. The originality of the construction is that the places of tor ture not being far removed from the luxurious alcoves, ball-rooms, and festive halls, they might very easily have heard, amid the singing in the courts of love, the shrieks and groans of the tortured, and the breaking and cracking of their bones. Priestly prudence had provided against this by a scientific arrangement of the vaults proper to absorb every kind of noise. The superb pyram idal hall where the flaming piles were erected (imagine the interior of a cone of sixty feet) testifies a frightful knowledge of acoustics ; only here and there a few traces of oily soot still call to mind the burning of flesh. \" The other place, both holy and sacred, is the Bagne (for galley-slaves) at Toulon, the Calvary of religious liberty, the place where the confessors of the faith, the heroes of charity, died a lingering death beneath the lash. Be it remembered that several of these mar tyrs, condemned to the galleys for life, were not Prot estants, but men accused of having allowed Protestants"], [107, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 73 to escape. Some were sold during the reign of Louis XV. M. de Choiseul, to pay his court to Voltaire, gave him one as a free gift. \"Alas ! nothing remains of those atrocious and superb galleys, gilded and sanguinary, more barbarous than those of Barbary, and which the lash watered with the blood of those saints. Even the registers in which their names were inscribed have for the most part disappeared. In the few that remain there are only laconic indications, their entrance and their exit ; and that exit was gener ally death. Death which came more or less speedily, thus indicating the degrees of resignation or despair. A terrible brevity ; two lines for a saint, two or three for a martyr. No note has been taken of the groans, the protestations, the appeals made to Heaven, the silent prayers, or the psalms chanted in a low voice amidst the blasphemies of thieves and murderers. ' Be comforted ! The tears of men are engraven for eternity in rock and marble ! ' said Christopher Columbus. In marble ? No, but in the human soul.\" The king had passively sanctioned the decrees of the Assembly, but that one called the Civil Constitution of the Clergy troubled his conscience, and he wrote pri vately to Pope Pius VI. excusing himself, and express ing his anxiety. In the medi\u00e6val ages, at the founding of the com munes, people here and there had taken the oath of friendship and fraternity. This idea of association, or federation, was understood to mean voluntary unity. There were federations of cantons, then of provinces, and finally the grand federation of all France in Paris. This movement, which resulted in the momentous fes tival of federation in Paris in 1790, began under the direction of a patriotic curate in September, 1789. The"], [108, "74 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. movement continued to increase. All the provinces entered into the spirit of it, one after another. Cham pagne, Lorraine, Alsace, Normandy, Angoumois, the country of the Loire, then Metz, Orleans, and Limoges, federated in May ; and on May 30, 1790, a grand festi val occurred at Lyons. The day after this celebration an edition of sixty thousand copies of a Lyons journal was issued, in which there was published an eloquent description of this beautiful festival written by Madame Roland, who was then residing in that city. Then followed the National Festival of Federation in Paris, on the 14th of July, 1790, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastile. A description of this memorable scene is given in another part of this volume. Henri Martin says : \" The admirable concord of the federation did not endure. Upon the great day of July 14th, 1790, as upon the great night of August 4th, men were lifted above themselves. From the sublime exalta tion of that day they fell back into the passions, the interests, and the errors of yesterday. Rumors of coun ter-revolutionary conspiracies, of the proceedings of emi grants in and out of France, agitated the public mind and excited the patriotic journals of Paris to redoubled violence. July 26th there appeared anonymously a ter rible pamphlet entitled, ' It is All over with Us ! ' Citi zens were called to arms ; they were exhorted to place the king and the dauphin under strict guardianship ; to imprison the Austrian woman (Marie Antoinette) and her brother-in-law (Monsieur) ; to arrest the ministers, the municipality, and the general (La Fayette). The author declared that cutting off of from five to six hundred heads would have assured the liberty and the happiness of France ; that the false humanity which had spared these heads would cost the lives of mil-"], [109, "MARIE ANTOINETTE,"], [110, ""], [111, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 75 lions of Frenchmen, should the enemies of the people triumph. \" All the world divined the author. One writer only was capable of using such language. It was Marat, a physician of forty years, born in French Switzerland, at Neufchatel. It was he who now demanded five or six hundred heads, and who was later to demand three hun dred thousand. He was a man of eccentric and gloomy disposition, of extreme ugliness. His strange glance, his elevated eyebrows, and the folds of his forehead in the portrait of him painted by Bose, give him the air of a madman. Poor and despised, believing himself an unappreciated genius, he had at the same time a sincere sympathy for the sufferings of the poor and humble, and a jealous hatred against all wdio possessed position, for tune, and especially renown. Always credulous of evil, he had made his journal, \"The Friend of the People,\" the receptacle of all accusations, of all public and private denunciations. He was incessantly in a rage, and the delirious violence of his language threw into a sort of fever the populace and the patriotic press ; while on the other hand it excited insolent raillery or rash menaces from the counter-revolutionary journals. The latter, as if to rival Marat, spoke only of killing and hanging.\" At first the pamphlet of Marat exasperated the moder ate party and frightened the most revolutionary. But soon news arrived that the aristocratic Bouille had or dered that Austrian troops, who were marching to put down the Belgian revolt against the house of Austria, should be allowed free passage over French territory. This caused great indignation in Paris, and the National Assembly demanded explanation of the ministers. Ex cuses were made and the order withdrawn. The Right in the Assembly denounced Marat, and"], [112, "76 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with him Camille Desmoulins, who had also written inflammatory articles. Robespierre defended Camille, and the Assembly instituted proceedings against Marat's pamphlet. Marat arrogantly braved the Assembly in his journal, and escaped pursuit by hiding in cellars, from whence he continued to launch forth his bitter invectives. In the year 1790, several open rebellions occurred in the army. They were occasioned by quarrels between the officers and the soldiers. The officers had neglected to pay their troops with any kind of regularity, and many revolts accordingly followed. The most impor tant was the rebellion at Nanci. General Bouille or dered his troops to march upon the Stainville gate, where the mutinous troops were collected. The defend ers of the gate, who had cannon, wished to fire. Desilles, a young officer of the king's regiment, threw himself at the cannon's mouth to prevent, at any price, the signal for the conflict being given. He was pushed away, but he heroically persisted in keeping his place amid cannon shot and bayonet thrusts, and they at length tore him from the cannon riddled with wounds. The cannon was fired, but Bouille's soldiers rushed on and forced the gate. The Swiss soldiers, with the people of Nanci who fought with them, were at last overpowered. Several hundreds were killed on both sides. (August 31, 1790.) \" This is the ' Affair of Nanci,' by some called the ' Mas sacre of Nanci ' ; properly speaking, the unsightly tvrong side of that thrice-glorious Feast of Pikes (the Festival of Federation), the right side of which formed a spectacle for the very gods. Right side and wrong lie always so near ; the one was in July, in August the other ! \" But, accord ing to Michelet, it was more a massacre than an \"affair \" at Nanci. The Swiss officers caused twenty-one of their"], [113, "I1F.SILLES AT THE CANNON'S MOUTH."], [114, ""], [115, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 77 remaining soldiers to be hung. Half the Swiss regiment had been killed in the affray. Fifty more of the Swiss soldiers were condemned to the galleys. No wonder that Michelet calls it disgraceful and blushes for his countrymen, saying, \"These people, who had been un willing to tire on us on the 14th of July, received, as a national reward, the penalty of dragging along a can non-ball in France.\" Rebellious soldiers must be put down, 'tis true. The Assembly returned thanks to Bouille' ; Louis XVI. expressed his extreme satisfaction. But since this rebellion was caused by the defrauding of wages honestly earned by these soldiers, and by the insufferable arrogance of their aristocratic officers, we are more ready to sympathize with the grief of the elo quent young Loustalot, who had become in two years one of the first of French journalists, when he exclaimed, on being informed of the remarks of Louis XVI., \" Alas ! that was not the language of Augustus when, at the account of a slaughter, he dashed his hand against a wall, shouting, ' Varus ! restore to me my legions ! ' \" On the 2d of September Paris learned the news of the massacre at Nanci, and a few hours later on the same day forty thousand men were crowding the Tuileries, besieging the Assembly, and shouting, \"Dismiss the ministers ! The heads of the ministers ! Hang the ministers ! (Les ministres d, la lanterne !) \" In consequence of the catastrophe at Nanci, there disappeared from the political stage of France a man who had held an important place in history. But his popularity had been growing less and less as the crises of the Revolution advanced. This was the Minister of Finance, Necker. He had lost his influence in the Assem bly, and the people who, but yesterday, hailed his return to France with the wildest enthusiasm, now pursued him"], [116, "78 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with the same clamors of discontent with which they had assailed preceding ministers. They called him an accom plice of Bouille, and blamed him for various reverses. Feeling that his political career in France was ended, Necker tendered his resignation September 4, 1790, and retired to Geneva, where he wrote an account of his administration. Like La Fayette, his disinterestedness had been complete. While other ministers of the An cient Regime had made immense fortunes during their terms of office, Necker and La Fayette had never ac cepted a dollar from the State. And La Fayette ex pended the greater portion of his fortune for the public welfare. The National Assembly decreed that henceforth it would itself direct the public treasury. This was to place its hand upon the motive force of executive power. The disposal of his rich civil list remained, however, to the king. The condition of the finances were again in a deplorable state. The very reforms decreed by the Assembly had created a new and enormous debt. The reimbursement of numerous venal charges of judicature, finance, and other things which had just been suppressed by the Assembly, fell upon the State. It was, as Louis Blanc has well said in his History of the Revolution, \" The Liquidation of the Ancient Regime.\" The debt thus created is stated to have been about eighteen hundred and eighty millions (francs). The interest on this debt was more than one hundred and sixty-eight millions. On the 10th of September the public treasury would have been obliged to suspend payment if the Caisse had not advanced ten millions. The four hundred millions of assignats issued were insuffi cient to replace the specie which continued to be exported or concealed. The Assembly then decreed a new issue"], [117, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 79 of eight hundred millions of assignats, and declared that there should never exist more than twelve hundred mil lion assignats at one time. As the estates of the crown and the clergy, now national estates, were worth four times that amount, it was evident if this limit was main tained there would be no danger to the public treasury. Necker having retired, force was brought to bear upon the remaining ministers to secure their retirement also ; and forty-eight sections of Paris sent a demand to the Assembly for the dismissal of the ministers and their trial before a high national tribunal. This blow took effect, and several of the ministers sent in their resigna tions. Three of these were replaced by men favorable to the Revolution. The emigrants, reunited at Turin under Count d'Ar tois, plotted a bold stroke upon Lyons. But the project was discovered. The German princes and lords who possessed domains in Alsace, Lorraine, and in Franche- Comt\u00a3, protested against the decrees of August 4th, as their privileged estates were thus made amenable to the common law. The German Emperor and the King of Prussia supported this protest. France offered indem nities which they refused. Belgium and Liege had revolted. After the 5th and 6th of October, 1789, a trial was held at the Chatelet tribunal relative to the invasion of the palace of Versailles, and the murder of the two body guards. The aristocrats imagined that this trial would bring to light the complicity of Mirabeau and the Duke of Orleans, as instigators of the riot. For Mirabeau this was only the occasion of a new triumph in the Assembly ; wrhich body, together with the Commune of Paris, declared that the people of Paris had thwarted the plots of the counter-revolution in marching on Ver-"], [118, "80 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. sailles ; and the great popular movement of October 5th should not be confounded with the crimes committed by a band of madmen on the morning of the 6th. In 1791, the principal decrees declared by the Constit uent Assembly were the admission of free people of color to an equality of rights with the whites ; the decree wresting from the king the privilege of pardoning crim inals ; the suppression of decorations and Orders of Knighthood; the decree enjoining emigrants to return to France ; and the decree relative to the National Guard. Louis accepted the constitution on September 14th, and the last sitting of the Constituent Assembly occurred on September 30, 1791. On October 1st, the Legislative Assembly met, and during the remainder of 1791 this body declared the following important decrees : The decree taking from the king the titles of \" Sire\" and \"Your Majesty \" ; the decree requiring Monsieur (Louis XVIII.) to return to France in two months on the penalty of being deprived of his right to the Regency ; the decree requiring the king to call upon the Princes of the Empire not to allow the assembling of emigrants in their territories. On Decem ber 19th the king vetoed the decrees relative to priests who refused to take the civic oath, and on the last day of that year the Assembly suppressed the ceremony usual on New Year's Day. In the year 1792, the following important measures were taken: The king's brothers were decreed under accusation as emigrants. The king's constitutional guard was instituted. An appropriation of the prop erty of emigrants was made to pay the expenses of the war. Religious communities were suppressed, and ecclesiastical costumes were prohibited. On April 20th declaration of war was made against Austria. In the"], [119, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 81 next month decrees of accusation were passed against Boyou and Marat. The king's paid guard was disbanded, and the National Assembly constituted itself in perma nent session. In June a decree was passed ordaining the formation of the Camp of twenty thousand, which measure was opposed by the king. In June, also, the ministers Servan, Roland, and Clavieres were dismissed ; and in July the country was declared to be in danger. In August, 1792, the king was suspended, and an ex ecutive council was formed. On August 13th the king and royal family were imprisoned in the Temple ; and in the same month the law was passed ordaining Domi ciliary Visits. In September the property of the emi grants was confiscated ; and on the 21st of that month the Legislative Assembly closed, after passing 2140 decrees relative to administration or legislation. Upon this same day occurred the opening of the National Convention, the abolition of Royalty, and proclamation of the Republic. On September 22d a decree was declared ordaining the renewal of all the administrative, municipal, and judicial bodies, as those in power were suspected of being tainted with royalism. On Septem ber 29th Louis XVI. was separated from his family and removed to the great tower of the Temple by order of the Convention. On October 9th the law was passed ordaining the immediate death of every emigrant taken in arms. On the fifteenth of the same month the Order of St. Louis was suppressed ; and later in October the decree was declared banishing all emigrants forever, and placing all who should return to France under the pen alty of death. On November 7th the decree was passed to put Louis XVI. on trial. In December of this year the decree was passed pronouncing the penalty of death against all who should propose or attempt to restore roy-"], [120, "82 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. alty in France ; also the decree banishing the Bourbons. On December 26th occurred the trial of Louis XVI., and on January 21, 1793, he was executed. In February, 1793, the Convention declared war against England and Holland, and the same month a decree was passed levy ing 300,000 men. In March the Convention declared war against Spain, and the Revolutionary Tribunal was instituted. During this year the Committee of General Safety was instituted, the Committee of Public Welfare organized, and the Duke of Orleans was arrested and imprisoned. Marat was decreed under accusation by the Convention, but was afterwards acquitted and borne in triumph to the hall of the Convention. A maximum was fixed for the price of corn and flour, and a forced loan of 1000 millions of francs was imposed upon the rich. The revolution of May 31st resulted in the downfall of the Girondins. In August Marie Antoinette was removed to the Conciergerie, and a decree was issued by the Conven tion declaring Pitt an enemy of mankind. In this month, also, all academies and literary societies were suppressed, and the Constitution of 1793 was accepted by the depu ties of 44,000 communes of the Republic. The great Book of the Public Debt was instituted, and the first eight heads of the civil code adopted. A decree was issued that a Revolutionary army should travel over every department with artillery and a guillotine, and a law was passed ordaining the levy en masse. On October 16th Marie Antoinette was executed, and on November 6th the Duke of Orleans ascended the scaffold. In November the Catholic Worship was super seded by that of Reason, and in December the Revolu tionary Government was organized. In 1794, the following important decrees were declared: That every condemned general should be executed at the"], [121, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 83 head of his army ; that the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI. should be celebrated as a national festi val; that slavery should be abolished in the colonies; and that the national flag should be composed of three vertical stripes of equal breadth, red, white, and blue. In March, Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and others were executed. In Paris the Executive Council was suppressed and succeeded by Twelve Commissions com posed of members of the Convention, and subordinate to the Committee of Public Welfare. A decree was issued that accused persons brought before the Revolu tionary Tribunal, who resisted the national justice, should not be allowed to plead, and should be sentenced forthwith. It was also decreed that every member of the Convention should give an account of his conduct, moral and political, and of his circumstances. In May, Madame Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI., was executed. In June the School of Mars was established, and in July Robespierre was executed ; and, also, eighty -three mem bers of the General Council of the Commune were led to the scaffold. In August a new Revolutionary Tribunal was installed, and a decree was passed limiting the powers of the Committee of Public Welfare. In October the Conservatory of Arts and Trades and the Normal School were instituted, and the School of Mars was sup pressed. In November a decree was passed closing the Hall of the Jacobins, and suspending their meetings ; and in December the deputies proscribed on the 31st of May, 1793, were readmitted into the Convention. In 1795 the treaty of Peace between France and Tus cany occurred. The Polytechnic School was instituted, and a treaty of peace was made between the French Republic and the King of Prussia. A uniform system of weights and measures was established. Fouquier-"], [122, "84 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Tinville and fifteen jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal were executed, and an alliance was made between the French and Batavian Republics. The public exercise of the Catholic religion was authorized, and the extraordi nary Revolutionary Tribunal was suppressed. A police legion was instituted for the safeguard of Paris, and a treaty of peace between France and Spain was signed. The Conservatory of Music was instituted, and the new Constitution of 1795 was adopted. Popular societies were dissolved, and on October 26th the National Con vention ended, after passing 8370 decrees. On October 28th occurred the first meeting of the Council of the Ancients and the Council of the Five Hundred. On November 1st the Directory was formed, and in Decem ber the daughter of Louis XVI. was exchanged for French prisoners. In 1796 the Ministry of the Police was instituted, and the Twelve Municipalities of Paris installed. In May a treaty of peace was made between the French Republic and the King of Sardinia, and the battles of Montenotte, Millesimo, Mondovi, Lodi, Altenkirchen, Ettlingen, Cas tiglione, Bassano, and others occurred. In 1797 occurred the battles of Rivoli, La Favorita, capitulation of Provera, passage of the Tagliamento, battle of Neuwied and the overthrow of the old Vene tian government, the formation of the Ligurian Re public, and the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic. All laws relative to the exile or confinement of priests who refused to take the oath were repealed. On Octo ber 17th the treaty of peace was signed at Campo Formio, between France and Austria, and on December 10th the Directory gave an imposing reception to Gen eral Bonaparte. In 1798 a forced loan of eighty millions of francs was"], [123, "DECREES OF THE ASSEMBLIES. 85 called for. The Expedition into Egypt occurred, result ing in the battle of the Pyramids. In September the Conscription was established, and a tax was imposed on doors and windows. War was declared against the kings of Naples and Sardinia, and the treaty of peace was ratified between France and the Helvetic Republics. In 1799, in the midst of defeats and successes of the French armies on foreign lands, occurred the events of the 30th of Prairial, and the return of General Bona parte from Egypt. Then followed the Revolution of the 18th Brumaire and the institution of the Consu late. On December 26th the Constitution of the year VIII. was formed, and Napoleon was nominated First Consul. This virtually ends the French Revolution. The Republic was superseded by the Consulate, and this passed afterwards into the Empire, when a military sovereign again sat upon the throne of France.

LOUIS XV. has fallen into his pestilential grave, and the reins of power have been placed in the hands of Louis XVI. \"This young prince had been educated in complete solitude at the court of Louis XV. The atmosphere which had infected the age had not touched his heir. Whilst Louis XV. had changed his court into a place of debauchery, his grandson, educated in a corner of the palace of Meudon by pious and enlightened masters, grew up in respect for his rank, in awe of the throne, and in a real love for the people whom he was one day to be called upon to govern. The soul of Fehelon seemed to have traversed two generations of kings in the palace where he had brought up the Duke of Burgundy in order"], [125, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 87 to inspire the education of his descendant. What was nearest to the crowned vice upon the throne was, per haps, the purest of anything in France. But the age was as dissolute as the king, and had reached that point of corruption in which purity appears ridiculous, and modesty was treated with contempt.\" 1 Europe was slumbering in peace. Louis XVI. had not been exercised in war, and thereby encountered men of force and learned the necessary habits of command. Fields of battle, which are the theatres of great actors in the stirring dramas of history, had not given him the op portunity of making himself a prominent figure before the eyes of his people. \" No prrestige except the circum stance of birth clung to him; his sole popularity was derived from the disgust inspired by his grandfather.\" Upright in character, and well informed in mind, he pos sessed no energy of will ; no realization of the impor tant functions of his royal station. Hunting was his only passion, and lock-making his favorite occupation; and even the wondrous beauty and many fascinations of the lovely Marie Antoinette could not for years move him from his stolid indifference to all things but the pleasures of the chase and the table. Instead of diligently studying the needs of his own kingdom he spent his time in poring over the geography of other countries or in reading the biographies of other monarchs, apparently utterly oblivious of the fact that he was, himself, the central figure in a terrible history which was being daily recorded before his blinded eyes. Poor Louis ! men cannot help pitying while they con demn. His faults arose not from wickedness but from weakness ; and after the abhorrent debaucheries of Louis XV., even the defects of Louis XVI. appear by contrast 1 Lamartine's Girondists."], [126, "88 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. as virtues rather than errors. So far as his unawakened soul was capable of love, he loved his people with sin cerity. As to governing them, he considered that to be the mission of his ministers ; he demanded nothing but the privilege of hunting and working at his forge. If he, the king, asked so little from his people, why should they murmur ? Ah, Louis ! you might, with impunity, have betaken yourself to your leathern apron and your hammer if you had possessed a Richelieu to govern in your stead. But as the case was, though you had many men of notoriety about you, the age had refused to you a statesman. \" From M. de Maurepas to M. Turgot ; from M. Tur got to M. de Calonne ; from M. de Calonne to M. Necker ; from M. Necker to M. de Malesherbes, he floated from an honest man to an intrigant, from a philosopher to a banker, whilst the spirit of system and charlatanism ill supplied the spirit of government. The Assembly of Notables, States-General, National Assembly, had all burst in the hands of royalty ; a revolution emanated from his good intentions more fierce and more irritable than if it had been the consequence of his vices. At the time when the king had this revolution before him in the National Assembly he had not in his councils one man capable of resisting, even of comprehending it.\" \" Henri Martin says: \"At the death of Louis XV., France could scarce be reckoned among the great powers of Europe. Her foreign colonies had been wrested from her, the navy was ruined, and her treasury was exhausted. The people, grown restive under ages of oppression, were full of murmurings and discontent. \"Through the culture of literature and philosophy, 1 Laniartine."], [127, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 89 the nation sought to cover the disgrace which had be fallen her arms. But with the spread of philosophical doctrines, was diffused a general desire for reform, which manifested itself in various ways, as soon as Louis XVI. ascended the throne. He seemed willing to lead the popular movement, but his heart was better than his head. He had not the firmness, the energy, or the ability to carry out the designs of those who sought to reform France ; he was influenced and controlled by the court party, which hated innovation, and held firmly to the divine right of kings and princes. The very aid he gave the American colonies in their war for indepen dence, hastened the French Revolution, and the final triumph of the colonies encouraged France to seek to win her own freedom.\" Carlyle says : \" Borne over the Atlantic, what sounds are these ; muffled, ominous, new in our centuries ? Bos ton Harbor is black with unexpected Teas ; behold a Pennsylvanian Congress gather ; and ere long, on Bunker Hill, democracy announcing, in rifle-volleys, death winged, under her Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee doodle-doo, that she is born, and, whirlwind-like, will envelop the whole world ! \" And whirlwind-like indeed is democracy rushing on ward towards France. Louis XV. heeded it not, as the first distant sounds reached his dying ear. Louis XVI. likewise heeds it not, although the sounds are fast grow ing nearer and more ominous. \" For the present, however, consider Longchamp ; now when Lent is ending, and the glory of Paris and France has gone forth, as in annual wont.

Dance on, ye foolish ones ; ye sought not wis dom, neither have ye found it. Ye and your fathers have sown the wind ; ye shall reap the whirlwind. Was it not, from of old, written, ' The wages of sin is death'?\"1 Lamartine thus describes the appearance and environ ments of Louis XVI. : \u2014 \" His features resembled those of his race, rendered somewhat heavy by the German blood of his mother, a princess of the House of Saxony. Fine blue eyes, very wide open, and clear rather than dazzling, a round and re treating forehead, a Roman nose, the nostrils flaccid and large, and somewhat destroying the energy of the aqui line profile, a mouth smiling and gracious in expression, lips thick, but well shaped, a fine skin, fresh and high colored in tint, though rather loose ; of short stature, stout frame, timid carriage, irregular walk, and when not moving, a restlessness of body in shifting first one foot and then the other, without advancing, a habit con tracted either from that impatience common to princes, compelled to undergo long audiences, or else the outward token of the constant wavering of an undecided mind. In his person there was an expression of bonhomie more vulgar than royal, which at the first glance in spired as much derision as veneration, and on which his 1 Carlyle."], [129, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 91 enemies seized with contemptuous perversity, in order to show to the people in the features of their ruler the visible and personal sign of those vices they sought to destroy in royalty ; in the tout ensemble some resemblance to the imperial physiognomy of the later C\u00e6sars at the period of the fall of things and races, the mildness of Antoninus with the vast obesity of Vitellius ; this was precisely the man. \" When we place ourselves in imagination in the posi tion of Louis XVI., and ask what could have saved him, we reply, disheartened, nothing. There are circumstan ces which enfold all a man's movements in such a snare, that, whatever direction he may take, he falls into the fatality of his faults or his virtues. This was the di lemma of Louis XVI. All the unpopularity of royalty in France, all the faults of preceding administrations, all the vices of kings, all the shame of courts, all the griefs of the people, were accumulated on his head, and marked his innocent brow, for the expiation of many ages. Epochs have their sacrifices as well as their religions. When they desire to recast an institution which no longer suits them, they pile upon the individual who personifies this institution all the odium and all the condemnation of the institution itself; they make of this man a victim whom they sacrifice to the time. Louis XVI. was this innocent sacrifice, overwhelmed with all the iniquities of thrones, and destined to lie immolated as a chastisement for royalty. Such was the king.\" 1 In the midst of all the factions which divided the realm, the king \"was without power, without privi lege, without force, and had merely the odious responsi- 1 Lamartine."], [130, "92 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. bility of anarchy.\" All parties made him the butt of their accusations, all successively excited the rage and hate of the people against him. \"From the tribune, Mirabeau, Barnave, Potion, La meth, and Robespierre, eloquently threatened the throne ; infamous pamphlets, factious journals, painted the king in colors of a tyrant who was brutalized by wine, who lent himself to every caprice of an abandoned woman, and who conspired in the recesses of his palace with the enemies of the nation. In the sinister feeling of his coming fall, the stoical virtue of this prince sufficed for the calming of his conscience, but was not adequate to his resolutions. \"On leaving the council of his ministers, where he loyally accomplished the constitutional conditions of his character, he sought, sometimes in the friendship of his devoted servants, sometimes from the very persons of his enemies, admitted by stealth to his confidence, the most important inspirations. Counsels succeeded to counsels, and contradicted one another in the royal ear, as their results contradicted each other in their opera tions. His enemies suggested concessions, promising him a popularity which escaped their hands just as they were about to ensure it to him. The court counselled the resistance which it had only in its dreams ; the queen, the courage she felt in her soul ; intriguers, cor ruption ; the timid, flight ; and in turns, and almost at the same time, he tried all these expedients : not one was efficacious ; the time for useful resolutions had passed ; the crisis was without remedy. It was necessary to choose between life and the throne. In endeavoring to preserve the two, it was written that he should lose both.\" l 1 Lamartine."], [131, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 93 The French historian, Mignet, thus clearly and con cisely describes the condition of France when Louis XVI. ascended the throne, on the 11th of May, 1774, and fol lows with a brief account of his various ministers, who are perhaps more tersely sketched by Mignet than by any other writer : \" Of all princes, Louis XVI., by his tenden cies and his virtues, was best suited to his epoch. The people were weary of arbitrary rule, and he was disposed to renounce its exercise ; they were exaspierated with the burdensome dissoluteness of the court of Louis XV. ; the morals of the new king were pure and his wants few ; they demanded reforms that had become indispensable, and he appreciated the public want, and made it his glory to satisfy it. But it wras as difficult to effect good as to continue evil, for it was necessary to have sufficient strength either to make the privileged classes submit to reform, or the nation to abuses; and Louis XVI. was neither a regenerator nor a despot. He was deficient in that sovereign will which alone accomplishes great changes in states, and which is as essential to nion archs who wish to limit their power as to those who seek to aggrandize it. \"Louis XVI. possessed a sound mind, a good and upright heart ; but he was without energy of character and perseverance in action. His projects of ameliora tion met with obstacles which he had not foreseen, and which he knew not how to overcome. He accordingly fell beneath his efforts to favor reform, as another would have fallen in his attempt to prevent it. Up to the meeting of the States-General his reign was one long and fruitless endeavor at amelioration. \" In choosing, on his accession to the throne, Maurepas as prime minister, Louis XVI. eminently contributed to the irresolute character of his reign. In him, the king"], [132, "94 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. found not a statesman, but a mere courtier, whose fatal influence extended over the whole course of his reign. Maurepas gave little heed to the welfare of France or the glory of his master ; his sole care was to remain in favor. Residing in the palace at Versailles, in an apartment communicating with that of the king, and presiding over the council, he rendered the mind of Louis XVI. uncer tain, his character irresolute ; he accustomed him to half measures, to changes of system, to all the inconsistencies of power, and especially to the necessity of doing every thing by others, and nothing of himself. Maurepas had the choice of the ministers, and these cultivated his good graces as assiduously as he the king's. Fearful of endangering his position, he kept out of the ministry men of powerful connections, and appointed rising men, who required his support for their own protection and to effect their reforms. He successfully called Turgot, Malesherbes, and Necker to the direction of affairs, who undertook to effect ameliorations each in that depart ment of the government which had been the immediate object of his studies. \" Malesherbes descended from a family in the law, in herited parliamentary virtues, and not parliamentary prejudices. He wished to give to every man his rights : to the accused, the power of being defended ; to Protes tants, liberty of conscience ; to authors, the liberty of the press; to every Frenchman, personal freedom; and he proposed the abolition of the torture, the re-establish ment of the Edict of Nantes, and the suppression of lettres-de-cachet, and of the censure. \" Turgot, of a vigorous and comprehensive mind, and an extraordinary firmness and strength of character, attempted to realize still more extensive projects. He joined Malesherbes in order, with his assistance, to com-"], [133, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 95 plete the establishment of a system which was to bring back unity to the government and equality to the coun try. This virtuous citizen constantly occupied himself with the amelioration of the condition of the people ; he undertook alone what the Revolution accomplished at a later period \u2014 the suppression of servitude and privilege. He proposed to enfranchise the rural districts from stat ute labor, provinces from their barriers, commerce from internal duties, trade from shackles, and lastly to make the nobility and clergy contribute to the taxes in the same proportion as the third estate. This great minis ter, of whom Malesherbes said, ' he has the head of Bacon and the heart of L'H6pital,' wished by means of provincial assemblies to accustom the nation to public life, and prepare it for the restoration of the States- General. He would have effected the revolution by ordinances had he been able to stand. But under the system of special privileges and general servitude all projects for the public good were impracticable. Tur got dissatisfied the courtiers by his ameliorations, dis pleased the parliament by the abolition of statute labor, wardenships, and internal duties, and alarmed the old minister by the ascendancy which his virtue gave him over Louis XVI. The prince forsook him, though at the same time observing that Turgot and himself were the only persons who desired the welfare of the people ; so lamentable is the condition of kings ! \"Turgot was succeeded in 1776 in the general control of the finances by Clugny, formerly Comptroller of Saint Domingo, who, six months after, was himself succeeded by Necker. Necker was a foreigner, a Protestant, a banker, and greater as an administrator than as a states man; he accordingly conceived a plan for reforming France, less extensive than that of Turgot, but which"], [134, "96 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. he executed with more moderation, and aided by the times. Appointed minister in order to find money for the court, he made use of the wants of the court to pro cure liberties for the people. He re-established the finances by means of order, and made the provinces contribute moderately to their administration. His views were wise and just; they consisted in bringing the revenue to a level with the expenditure by reducing the latter, by employing taxation in ordinary times, and loans when imperious circumstances rendered it neces sary to tax the future as well as the present, by causing the taxes to be assessed by the provincial assemblies, and by instituting the publication of accounts in order to facilitate loans. \"This system was founded on the nature of loans which, needing credit, require publicity of administra tion; and on that of taxation which, needing assent, requires also a share in the administration. Whenever there is a deficit, and the government makes applications to meet it, if it address itself to lenders, it must produce its balance-sheet ; if it address itself to tax-payers, it must give them a share of the power. Thus loans led to the production of accounts, and taxes to the States- General ; the first placing authority under the jurisdic tion of opinion, and the second placing it under that of the people. But Necker, though less impatient for reform than Turgot, for he desired to redeem abuses which his predecessor wished to destroy, was not more fortunate than he. His economy displeased the court iers ; the measures of the provincial assemblies incurred the disapprobation of the parliaments which wished to monopolize opposition ; and the prime minister could not forgive him an appearance of credit. He was obliged to quit power in 1781, a few months after the pub-"], [135, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 97 lication of the famous comptes rendus of the finances, which suddenly initiated France in a knowledge of state matters, and rendered the return of an absolute govern ment impossible. \" The death of Maurepas followed close upon the re tirement of Necker. The queen took his place with Louis XVI., and inherited all his influence over him. This good but weak prince required to be directed. His wife, young, beautiful, active, and ambitious, gained great ascendancy over him. Yet it may be said that the daughter of Maria Theresa resembled her mother too much or too little. She combined frivolity with domi nation, and disposed of power only to invest with it men who caused her own ruin and that of the State. Maure pas, mistrusting court ministers, had always chosen popu lar ministers ; it is true he did not support them, but if good was not brought about, at least evil did not in crease. After his death, court ministers succeeded the popular ministers, and by their faults rendered the crisis inevitable which others had endeavored to prevent by their reforms. This difference of choice is very remark able ; this it was which, by the change of men, brought on the change in the system of administration. The Revolution dates from this epoch ; the abandonment of reforms and the return of disorders hastened its ap proach, and augmented its fury. \" Calonne was called from an intendancy to the general control of the finances. Calonne was daring, brilliant, and eloquent ; he had much readiness and a fertile mind. Either from error or design, he adopted a system of administration directly opposed to that of his predeces sor. Necker recommended economy ; Calonne boasted of his lavish expenditure. Necker fell through courtiers ; Calonne sought to be upheld by them. His sophisms"], [136, "98 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. were backed by his liberality; he convinced the queen by sites, the nobles by pensions ; he gave a great circula tion to the finances, in order that the extent and facility of his operations might excite confidence in the justness of his views ; he even deceived the capitalists by at first showing himself punctual in his payments. He contin ued to raise the loans after the peace, and he exhausted the credit which Necker's wise conduct had procured to the government. Having come to this point, having deprived himself of a resource, the very employment of which he was unable to manage, in order to prolong his continuance in power he was obliged to have recourse to taxation. But to whom could he apply ? The peo ple could pay no longer, and the privileged classes would not offer anything. Yet it was necessary to decide, and Calonne, hoping more from something new, convoked an assembly of Notables. But a recourse to others must prove the end of a system founded on prodigality. A minister who had risen by giving could not maintain himself by asking.\" \" Happy was a young ' Louis the Desired ' to make France happy,\" says Carlyle, \"if it did not prove too troublesome, and he only knew the way. But there is endless discrepancy round him ; so many claims and clamors, \u2014 a mere confusion of tongues. Not reconcila ble by man ; not manageable, suppressible, save by some strongest and wisest man ; \u2014 which only a lightly-jesting, lightly-gyrating M. de Maurepas can so much as subsist amidst. Philosophism claims her new Era, meaning thereby innumerable things. And claims it in no faint voice ; for France at large, hitherto mute, is now begin ning to speak also, and speaks in that same sense. A huge many-toned sound, distant, yet not unimpressive. On the other hand the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf, which, as nearest,"], [137, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 99 one can hear best, claims with shrill vehemence that the Monarchy be as heretofore, a Horn of Plenty, wherefrom loyal courtiers may draw, to the just support of the throne. Let Liberalism and a New Era, if such is the wish, be introduced; only no curtailment of the royal moneys ! Which latter condition, alas ! is precisely the impossible one. \"Meanwhile the fair young Queen, in her halls of State, walks like a goddess of Beauty, the cynosure of all eyes ; as yet mingles not with affairs ; heeds not the future ; least of all, dreads it. Weber and Campan have pictured her there within the royal tapestries, in bright boudoirs, baths, peignoirs, and the grand and little toi lette, with a whole brilliant world waiting obsequious on her glance ; fair young daughter of Time, what things has Time in store for thee ! Like Earth's brightest Ap pearance, she moves gracefully, environed with the gran deur of Earth, \u2014 a reality, and yet a magic vision ; for, behold ! shall not utter darkness swallow it ? The soft young heart adopts orphans, portions meritorious maids, delights to succour the poor, \u2014 such poor as come pic turesquely in her way, \u2014 and sets the fashion of doing it ; for Benevolence has now begun reigning. In her Duchesse de Polignac, in her Princesse de Lamballe, she enjoys something almost like friendship ; now, too, after seven years, she has a child, and soon even a Dauphin, of her own ; can reckon herself, as queens go, happy in a husband.\"1 And yet \"this fair young Queen,\" is not entirely given up to pleasure or courtly follies, as her correspondence shows. In the \"Secrete Correspondence entre Marie- TMrese et le Comte Mercy d'Argenteau, avec des lettres de i Carlyle."], [138, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 100 Marie-Therese et de Marie- Antoinette,\" published by M. Arneth, the letters between Marie Antoinette and her mother, Maria Theresa, reveal the stronger side of the young queen's character, and evince her keen intuitions and just estimates of political affairs. As the death of Maria Theresa occurred in 1780, these letters do not come down to the time of the French Revolution, but the fol lowing one, from Marie Antoinette to her mother, regard ing the quarrel between Austria and Prussia, displays the strength of her mind and the keenness of her observations, though she was then only twenty years of age : \u2014 \" How kind my dear Mamma is to express her approval of the way in which I have conducted myself in these affairs up to the present time. Alas ! there is no need for you to feel obliged to me ; it was my heart that acted in the whole matter. I am only vexed at not being able to enter into the feelings of all these ministers, so as to be able to make them comprehend how every thing which has been done and demanded by the author ities at Vienna is just and reasonable. But, unluckily, none are more deaf than those who will not hear ; and, besides, they have such a number of terms and phrases which mean nothing, that they bewilder themselves before they come to say a single reasonable thing. I will try one plan, and that is to speak to them both in the King's presence, to induce them, at least, to use language suit able to the occasion concerning the King of Prussia ; and in good truth it is for the interest and glory of the King [Louis] himself that I am anxious to see this done ; for he cannot but gain by supporting allies who, on every account, ought to be so dear to him. \" In other respects he behaves most admirably, and is most attentive to me. I protest to you, my dear Mamma, that my heart would be torn by the idea that you could"], [139, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 101 for a moment suspect his good will in what has been done. No ; it is the terrible weakness of his ministers and his own great want of self-reliance which does all the mischief ; and I am sure that if he would never act but on his own judgment every one would see his honesty, his correctness of feeling, and his tact, which at present they are far from appreciating.\" But the young queen is mostly forced to move with the fashionable tide, which Carlyle so admirably satir izes : \u2014 \" Events ? The grand events are but charitable Feasts of Morals (Fetes des M\u0153urs) with their Prizes and Speeches, Poissarde Processions to the Dauphin's cradle ; above all, Flirtations, \u2014 their rise, progress, decline, and fall. There are snow statues raised by the poor in winter to a Queen who has given them fuel. There are masquerades, theatricals, beautifyings of little Trianon, purchase and repair of St. Cloud, journeyings from the summer Court- Elysium to the winter one. There are poutings and grudgings from the Sardinian Sisters-in-law (for the Princes too are wedded), \u2014 little jealousies which Court- Etiquette can moderate. Wholly the light-hearted, friv olous foam of Existence, yet an artfully refined foam; pleasant, were it not so costly, like that which mantles on the wine of Champagne !\" Carlyle thus graphically pictures the political aspect of French affairs : \u2014 \"Good old cheery Maurepas is too joyful a Prime Minister to dash the world's joy. Sufficient for the day be its own evil. Cheery old man ! he cuts his jokes and hovers carelessly along, his cloak well adjusted to the wind, if so be he may please all persons. \"The simple young King, whom Maurepas cannot think of troubling with business, has retired into the"], [140, "102 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. interior apartments, taciturn, irresolute, though with a sharpness of temper at times ; he at length determines on a little smith work ; and so, in apprenticeship with a Sieur Gamain (whom one day he shall have little cause to bless), is learning to make locks. It appears further he understood Geography and could read English. Un happy young King ! his childlike trust in that foolish old Maurepas deserved another return. But friend and foe, destiny and himself have combined to do him hurt. \"But now, among French hopes, is not that of old M. de Maurepas one of the best grounded ? who hopes that he, by dexterity, shall contrive to continue Minis ter ? Nimble old man, -who, for all emergencies, has his light jest, and ever in the worst confusion will emerge, cork-like, unsunk ! Small care to him is Perfectibility, Progress of the Species, and Astraea Redux ; good only that a man of light wit, verging towards fourscore, can in the seat of authority feel himself important among men. Shall we call him, as haughty Chateau roux was wont of old, ' M. Faquinet ' [diminutive of \" scoundrel \"] ? In courtier dialect, he is now named ' the Nestor of France ' ; such governing Nestor as France has. \" At bottom, nevertheless, it might puzzle one to say where the Government of France in these days espe cially is. In that Chateau of Versailles we have Nestor, King, Queen, ministers, and clerks with paper bundles tied in tape ; but the Government ? For Government is a thing that governs, that guides, and if need be, compels. Visible in France, there is not such a thing. Invisible, inorganic, on the other hand, there is, in Philosophe saloons, in \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf galleries, in the tongue of the babbler, in the pen of the pamphleteer. France was a"], [141, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 103 ' Despotism tempered by Epigrams ' ; and now, it would seem, the Epigrams have got the upper hand. \" Philosophism, as we saw, has got her Turgot made Controller-General ; and there shall be endless reforma tion. Unhappily, this Turgot could continue only twenty months. \"With a miraculous Fortunatus' Purse in his Treasury, it might have lasted longer; with such Purse, indeed, every French Controller-General, who would prosper in these days, ought first to provide himself. Turgot has faculties, \u2014 honesty, insight, heroic volition, \u2014 but the Fortunatus' Purse he has not. Sanguine Controller- General ! a whole pacific French Revolution may stand schemed in the head of the thinker ; but who shall pay the unspeakable ' indemnities ' that will be needed ? Alas ! far from that : on the very threshold of the busi ness, he proposes that the Clergy, the Noblesse, the very Parliaments, be subjected to taxes like the people ! One shriek of indignation and astonishment reverberates through all the Chateau galleries ; M. de Maurepas has to gyrate ; the poor king, who had written a few weeks ago, '11 n'y a que vous et moi qui aimions le peuple' [\" There is none but you and I who have the people's interest at heart \"], must write now a dismissal ; and let the French Revolution accomplish itself, pacifically or not, as it can. \" What to do with the Finances ? This indeed is the great question ; a small, but most black-weather symp tom, which no radiance of universal hope can cover. We saw Turgot cast forth from the Controllership with shrieks, \u2014 for want of a Fortunatus' Purse. As little could M. de Clugny manage the duty, or, indeed, do anything but consume his wages; attain a 'place in History,' where as an ineffectual shadow thou beholdest"], [142, "104 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. him still lingering, \u2014 and let the duty manage itself. Did Genevese Necker possess such a Purse, then ? He possessed banker's skill, banker's honesty ; credit of all kinds, for he had written Academic Prize Essays, strug gled for Indian Companies, given dinners to Philosophes, and ' realized a fortune in twenty years.' He possessed, further, a taciturnity and solemnity ; of depth or else of dulness. And so Necker, Atlas-like, sustains the burden of the Finances for five long years. Without wages, for he refused such ; cheered only by Public Opinion, and the ministering of his noble Wife. With many thoughts in him, it is hoped; \u2014 which, however, he is shy of utter ing. His Compte Rendu, published by the royal per mission, fresh signs of a New Era, shows wonders ; \u2014 which what but the genius of some Atlas-Necker can prevent from becoming portents ? In Necker's head, too, there is a whole pacific French Revolution, of its kind ; and in that taciturn dull depth, or deep dulness, ambition enough. \" Meanwhile, alas ! his Fortunatus' Purse turns out to be little other than the old ' Vectigal of Parsimony.' Nay, he too has to produce his scheme of taxing ; Clergy, Noblesse, to be taxed ; Provincial Assemblies, and the rest, \u2014 like a mere Turgot ! The expiring M. de Maure pas must gyrate one other time. Let Necker also depart ; not unlamented. \"Light old M. de Maurepas, since the end of 1781, has been fixed in the frost of death ; his light jestings and gyratings are at an end. No more can the importu nate reality be hidden by pleasant wit, and to-day's evil be deftly rolled over upon to-morrow. The morrow itself has arrived ; and now nothing but a solid phleg matic M. de Vergennes sits there, in dull matter-of-fact, like some dull punctual Clerk (which he originally was) ;"], [143, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 105 admits what cannot be denied, let the remedy come whence it will. In him is no remedy ; only clerk-like 'despatch of business,' according to routine. The poor King, growing older yet hardly more experienced, must himself, with such no-faculty as he has, begin govern ing; wherein also his Queen will give help. Bright Queen, with her quick clear glances and impulses ; clear, and even noble ; but all too superficial, vehement-shallow, for that work ! To govern France were such a problem ; and even it has grown well-nigh too hard to govern even the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf. For, if a distressed People has its cry, so likewise, and more audibly, has a bereaved Court. To the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf it remains inconceivable howr, in a France of such resources, the Horn of Plenty should run dry ; did it not use to flow ? Nevertheless, Necker, with his revenue of parsimony, has ' suppressed above six hundred places,' before the Courtiers could oust him ; parsimonious finance-pedant as he was. Again, a mili tary pedant, Saint-Germain, with his Prussian man\u0153u vres, with his Prussian notions, as if merit and not coat of-arms should be the rule of promotion, has disaffected military men; the Mousquetaires, with much else are suppressed ; for he too was one of your suppressors ; and unsettling and oversetting did mere mischief \u2014 to the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf. Complaints abound ; scarcity, anxiety; it is a changed \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf. \"No wonder that the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf feels melancholy, when you are suppressing its places ! Not a place can be suppressed, but some purse is the lighter for it, and more than one heart the heavier ; for did it not employ the working-classes too, \u2014 manufacturers, male and fe male, of laces, essences; of Pleasure generally, whoso ever could manufacture Pleasure ? \"Under such circumstances of tristesse, obstruction"], [144, "106 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. and sick languor, when to an exasperated Court it seems as if fiscal genius had departed from among men, what apparition could be welcomer than that of M. de Calonne ? Calonne, a man of indisputable genius ; even fiscal genius, more or less ; of experience both in managing Finance and Parlements, for he has been Intendant at Metz, at Lille; King's procureur at Douai. A man of weight, connected with the moneyed classes ; of unstained name, \u2014 if it were not some peccadillo (of showing a client's letter) in that old D'Aiguillon-Lachalotais business, as good as forgotten now. He has kinsmen of heavy purse, felt on the Stock-Exchange. Our Foulons, Berthiers, intrigue for him; \u2014 old Foulon, who has now nothing to do but to intrigue ; who is known and even seen to be what they call a scoundrel ; but of unmeasured wealth ; who, from Commissariat-clerk, which he once was, may hope, some think, if the game go right, to be Minister himself one day. \" Such propping and backing has M. de Calonne ; and then intrinsically such qualities ! Hope radiates from his face ; persuasion hangs on his tongue. For all straits he has present remedy, and will make the world roll on wheels before him. Great is the felicity of the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf. Stinginess has fled from these royal abodes ; Suppression ceases ; smiling Plenty, as if conjured by some enchanter, has returned ; scatters contentment from her new-flowing horn. And mark what suavity of manners ! A bland smile distinguishes our Controller; to all men he listens with an air of interest; nay, of anticipation; makes their own wish clear to themselves, and grants it ; or, at least, grants con ditional promise of it. A man of such ' facility,' withal. To observe him in the pleasure-vortex of society, which none partakes of with more gusto, you might ask, when"], [145, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 107 does he work ? And yet his work, as we see, is never behindhand ; above all, the fruit of his work, ready money. Truly a man of incredible facility; facile ac tion, facile elocution, facile thought ; how, in mild suasion philosophic depth sparkles up from him, as mere wit and lambent sprightliness ; and in her Majesty's Soirees, with the weight of a world lying on him, he is the delight of men and women ! By what magic does he accomplish miracles ? By the only true magic, that of genius. Men name him 'the Minister,' as, indeed, when was there another such ? Crooked things are become straight by him, rough places plain; and over the \u0152il de-B\u0153uf there rests an unspeakable sunshine. \"Nay, in seriousness, let no man say that Calonne had not genius ; genius for Persuading ; before all things, for Borrowing. With the skilfullest judicious appli ances of underhand money, he keeps the Stock-Exchanges flourishing ; so that Loan after Loan is filled up as soon as opened. ' Calculators likely to know,' have calculated that he spent, in extraordinaries, ' at the rate of one million daily ; ' which, indeed, is some fifty thousand pounds sterling. But did he not procure something with it ; namely, peace and prosperity, for the time being ? Philosophedom grumbles and croaks ; buys 80,000 copies of Necker's new Book; but Nonpareil Calonne, in her Majesty's Apartment, with the glitter ing retinue of Dukes, Duchesses, and more happy, ad miring faces, can let Necker and Philosophedom croak. \" The misery is, such a time cannot last ! Squandering, and Payment by Loan is no way to choke a Deficit. Neither is oil the substance for quenching conflagra tion^ \u2014 alas, no ; only for assuaging them, not perma nently!

Apart from financial Deficit, the world is wholly in such a new-fangled humor ; all things work ing loose from their old fastenings, towards new issues and combinations. But what then ? The day, in any case, passes pleasantly ; for the morrow, if the morrow come, there shall be counsel, too. Once mounted (by munificence, suasion, magic of genius) high enough in favor with the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf, with the King, Queen, Stock-Exchange, and so far as possible with all men, a Nonpareil Controller may hope to go careering through the Inevitable, in some unimagined way, as handsomely as another. \" At all events, for these three miraculous years, it has been expedient heaped on expedient, till now, with such cumulation and height, the pile topples perilous. And here has this world's-wonder of a Diamond Neck lace brought it at last to the clear verge of tumbling. Genius in that direction can no more : mounted high enough, or not mounted, we must fare forth. Hardly is poor Rohan, the Necklace-Cardinal, safely bestowed in the Auvergne Mountains, Dame de Lamotte (unsafely) in the Salpetri^re, and that mournful business hushed up, when our sanguine Controller once more astonishes the world. An expedient, unheard of for these hundred and sixty years, has been propounded, and by dint of suasion (for his light audacity, his hope, and eloquence, are matchless) has been got adopted, Convocation of the Notables. \"Here, then, is verily a sign and wonder, visible to the whole world, bodeful of much.

Audacity and hope alternate in him with misgivings, though the sanguine-valiant side carries it. In deep obscure unrest, all things have so long gone rocking and swaying ; will M. de Calonne, with his alchemy of the Notables, fasten all together again, and get new reve nues ? Or wrench all asunder, so that it go no longer rocking and swaying, but clashing and colliding ? \" And so the Notables at length, assembled. On the 22d of February, 1787, they met.

Surely these illustrious Notables will accomplish something ! With all these mighty intellects at work, there were truly some way to be found, or invented, or at least sug gested out of the difficulty. Calonne does indeed suggest and expostulate, and grow eloquent, but in vain. \" Headlong Calonne had given no heed to the compo sition, or judicious packing of them, but had chosen such Notables as were really notable, trusting for the issue to off-hand ingenuity, good fortune, and eloquence that never yet failed.

Even Ca lonne the powerful, the hitherto invincible, acknowledges himself at last beaten by the direful deficit, and obsequi ously asks the Notables to help him solve the awful rid dle, \u2014 how shall a king's treasury be filled when there is only debt to fill it ? As well carry water in a pail with no bottom. And now a storm arises around the head of the Controller-General. His eloquence cannot save him. At this Assembly of the Notables, a communication on the state of the finances being demanded, a noble counsellor had very pertinently said : \" It is not states of finance we want, it is States-General.\" The affair of the \" Diamond Necklace,\" has been so often narrated that it is necessary only to remark that Henri Martin declared that the result of the trial which followed, was \" a proof of the general demoralization of the whole French nation.\" He adds : \" Our impression concerning it is the impossibility of the queen's being culpable. But the imputations directed against her were those most likely to be believed, as such imputa tions were characteristic of the times, and attested the moral ruin of the monarchy. C'etait V ombre du Pare aux Cerfs qui couvrait toujours Versailles.\" Campardon, an accomplished French writer, who has devoted much care and ability to an examination of the case, pronounces the opinion that the Cardinal de Rohan was innocent of dishonesty, and limits his offence to that of insulting the queen, by imagining that she would confide in such an unworthy person as the Countess Lamotte, and that he could estimate his sovereign so lightly as to suppose that he could recover her royal favor by such base means as he employed. Unquestion ably, neither Louis nor Marie Antoinette doubted his full complicity in the conspiracy."], [149, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 111 Marie Antoinette did not hesitate to express openly her indignation at the acquittal \" of an intriguer who had sought to ruin her, or to procure money for himself by abusing her name and forging her signature,\" adding, \" that the nation was still more to be pitied than herself which had for its supreme tribunal a body of men who consulted nothing but their passions, and of whom some were full of corruption, and others were inspired with a boldness which always vented itself in opposition to those who were clothed with lawful authority.\"' In writing to Madame de Polignac, she says, \"that she was bathed in tears of grief and despair, and that she can hope for nothing good when perverseness is so busy in seeking means to chill her very soul. But that she shall triumph over her enemies, by doing more good than ever, and that it will be easier for them to afflict her, than to drive her to avenge herself on them.\" Expressing herself still more strongly to her sister Christine, she writes \" of her indignation at being sac rificed to a perjured priest and a shameless intriguer.\" She craves her sister's \" pity, as one who had never deserved such injurious treatment, but who had only recollected that she was the daughter of Maria Theresa, to fulfil her mother's exhortations, always to show her self French to the very bottom of her heart, and that nothing shall tempt her to any conduct unworthy of her self, and that the only revenge that she will take shall be to redouble her acts of kindness.\" \"But now, while Ex-Controller Calonne flies storm driven over the horizon, what has become of the Con trollership?

Be patient, ye Notables ! An actual new Controller is certain, and even ready, were the indispensable man\u0153uvres but gone through. Lomenie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse, afterwards Archbishop of Sens, who at least has strug gled these fifty years to have it thought that he was a man of great capacity, who had all his life ' felt a kind of predestination for the highest offices,' has now there fore obtained them. He presides over the Finances ; he shall have the title of Prime Minister itself, and the effort of his long life be realized. Unhappily, only, that it took such talent and industry to gain the place that to qualify for it hardly any talent or industry was left disposable.\" 1 So Calonne was succeeded by Brienne, Archbishop of Sens. But the privileged classes were no more disposed to make sacrifices at the demand of Brienne, than they had been to consent to Calonne's proposals. Prudent Brienne, knowing how much uproar a little adverse clamor can start, graciously informed the Notables that their arduous labors were completed, and with a great flourish of eloquence he gracefully dismissed them to their respective homes. Thus finished the sitting of the Notables, the first that had occurred since 1626, under the sway of Richelieu. And now as cash must be ob tained, if not by eloquence, why then by force, the Paris Parliament was convoked, and Brienne attempted to accomplish his desired reforms by means of edicts. Mignet says : \" The Archbishop of Sens, who is cen sured for a want of plan, was in no position to form one. He was not allowed to continue the prodigality of 1 Carlyle."], [151, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 113 Calonne ; and it was too late to return to the retrench ments of Necker. Economy, which had been a means of safety at a former period, was no longer so in this. Either taxation must be resorted to and that Parlia ment opposed, or loans; aud credit was exhausted: or sacrifices on the part of the privileged classes, who were unwilling to make them. Brienne, to whom office had been the chief object of life, attempted everything, and succeeded in nothing. His mind was active, but it wanted strength ; and his character was rash, without firmness. Daring, previous to action; but weak after wards; he ruined himself by his irresolution, want of foresight, and constant variation of means. Brienne had recourse to taxation. He demanded the enrolment of two edicts, \u2014 that of the stamps, and that of the territo rial subsidies. But Parliament, which was then in the full vigor of its existence, and in all the ardor of its am bition, and to which the financial embarrassment of the ministry offered a means of augmenting its power, re fused the enrolment.\" Concerning this point, Carlyle says : \" When a Parlia ment refuses registering, the remedy by long practice has become familiar to the simplest : a Bed of Justice. One complete month this Parliament has spent in mere idle jargoning, and sound and fury ; the Timbre Edict not registered, or like to be ; the Subvention not yet so much as spoken of. On the 6th of August, let the whole refractory Body roll out, in wheeled vehicles, as far as the King's Chateau of Versailles ; there shall the king, holding his Bed of Justice, order them by his own royal lips to register. They may remonstrate in an under tone, but they must obey, lest a worse unknown thing befall them. \" It is done : the Parliament has rolled out on royal"], [152, "114 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. summons ; has heard the express royal order to register. Whereupon, it has rolled back again, amid the hushed expectancy of men. And now behold, on the morrow, this Parliament seated once more in its own Palais, not only does not register, but (0 portent !) declares all that was done on the prior day to be null, and the Bed of Jus tice as good as a futility ! In the history of France here verily is a new feature. Nay, better still, our heroic Parliament getting suddenly enlightened on several things, declares that for its part, it is incompetent to register Tax edicts at all, having clone it by mistake dur ing these late centuries ; that for such act one authority only is competent : the assembled Three Estates of the Realm.\" And so forsooth this rebellious Parliament must be brought to see its heinous error. The punishment for Parliaments is banishment. Therefore, forthwith the dis obedient Parliament is trundled off to Troyes in Cham pagne ; that it may brood upon its errors and repent. One dull month of calling cases, and finding no lawyers to plead, with attractive Paris so near, and yet so far away, proves too much for the heroic resistance of the pleasure-loving Parliament ; and so it yields and makes a truce. \" The Stamp-tax is withdrawn ; the Subvention Land-tax is also withdrawn,\" and there is granted a \"Prorogation of the Second Twentieth,\" a kind of Land tax, which shall lie mainly on the thus far. dumb but speedily awakening class. And so the exiled Parlia ment returns, not covered with glory ; and D'Espr\u00a3m6nil dares to speak more plainly, and declares that it came back \"covered with mud\" [de boue~\\. But gloriously or not, Parliament must return, for Lomenie de Brienne has concocted new plots, for an Edict of a Successive Loan must be proposed. \" To con-"], [153, "115 THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. ciliate the Philosophes, let a liberal Edict walk in front of it, for emancipation of Protestants ; let a liberal Prom ise guard the rear of it, that when our Loan ends, in that final 1792, the States-General shall be convoked.\" Marie Antoinette, in writing to the Duchess de Poli gnac, in 1787, gives this racy political picture of the Court : \" Where you are you can at least enjoy the com fort of never hearing of business. Although you are in the country of an Upper and Lower House, you can stop your ears and let people talk. But here it is a noise that deafens me in spite of all I can do. The words, ' Opposition,' and ' Motions,' are established here as in the English Parliament, with this difference, that in London, when people go into opposition, they begin by denuding themselves of the favors of the king, instead of which, here, numbers oppose all the wise and benefi cent views of the most virtuous of masters, and still keep all he has given them. It may be a cleverer way of managing, but it is not so gentleman-like. The time of illusion is past. We are tasting cruel experience. The voice of honest men is stifled by cabals. Men dis regard principles to bind themselves to words, and to multiply attacks on individuals. The seditious will drag the State to its ruin, rather than renounce their intrigues.\" But what mystery is going on at the king's palace, under lock and key ? It is whispered that incessant printing is being done within the royal walls. Sentries are placed at gates and windows, that the printers go not out, and curious intruders come not in. Food is even handed in to these imprisoned printers, and they sleep also beneath the king's roof. Parliament grows dis trustful, and busybodies scent danger.

Gold will purchase much, will it accomplish this desired result ? D'Espremenil at tempts to work this miracle. One hundred louis d'or find their way to the hand of a printer's wife whose hus band is within that hidden room. A cunning woman and gold can sometimes discover secrets which baffle the ingenuity of man. A ball of clay is thrown out from a window. Is that all you have gotten for your gold and trouble, daring D'Espremenil ? Wait one moment ; break it with your sword, and forthwith behold the printed proof sheets of the Royal Edict. Hasten to the Parlia ment, read aloud that odious edict. Plenary Courts, and Grand Bailliages! These are to starve the Parliament by depriving it of its fat revenues of lawsuits. What shall a Parliament do ? Defy the royal authority ; and as to the audacious D'Espremenil and his assistant Goeslard, what punishment will Brienne administer to you ? But now desperate Lomenie de Brienne, indignant, hurls his thunderbolts, de Cachet; and daring D'Espre menil and Counsellor Goeslard de Monsabert, who have been so bold as even to brave his ministerial anger, must be silenced. The thunderbolts are launched, and in vain the senators exclaim in answer to the captain, ordered to arrest these two, M. Duval d'Espremenil and M. Goeslard de Monsabert, \"We are all Esprhnenils!\" In vain speeches are made, and expostulations entered upon. The stern captain knows only the royal command. \" Messieurs, de par le Roi I \" replies Captain d'Agoust ; and the lettres-de-cachet are safely lodged and executed, and the two fated ones are sent into exile. But they are not alone in this honorable dishonor. Soon the Par liament itself is turned out into the street, and wanders"], [155, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 117 disconsolate. But beware, 0 Lom6nie de Brienne ! thy triumph is short ! Thou hast not yet removed the evil \" scarcely the twelfth part of the symptom, and exasper ated the other eleven.\" Against these Bailliages, against this Plenary Court, parties and provinces arise in wild clamors of denun ciation. \" The afflicted Bretons send remonstrance to Lomenie, by a Deputation of Twelve; whom, however, Lomenie, having heard, shuts them up in the Bastile. A sec ond larger Deputation he meets, by his scouts, on the road, and persuades or frightens back. But now a third largest Deputation is indignantly sent by many roads. Refused audience on arriving, it meets to take counsel ; invites La Fayette, and all Patriot Bretons in Paris to assist; agitates itself; becomes the Breton Club, first germ of \u2014 the Jacobins' Society. \"So many as eight Parliaments get exiled: others might need that remedy, but it is one not always easy of appliance. At Grenoble, for instance, where a Mounier, a Barnave have not been idle, the Parliament had due order (by Lettres-de-Cachet) to depart, and exile itself : but on the morrow, instead of coaches getting yoked, the alarm-bell bursts forth, ominous, and peals and booms all day. Crowds of mountaineers rush down, with axes, even with fire-locks, whom (most ominous of all) the soldiery shows no eagerness to deal with. 'Axe over head,' the poor General has to sign capitulation ; to engage that the Lettres-de-Cachet shall remain unexe cuted, and a beloved Parliament stay where it is. \"Besancon, Dijon, Rouen, Bourdeaux, are not what they should be ! At this rate, your Grand Bailliages are like to have a stormy infancy. As for the Plenary Court, it has literally expired. The very Courtiers looked"], [156, "118 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. shy at it ; old Marshal Broglie declined the honor of sit ting therein. Assaulted by a universal storm of mingled ridicule and execration, this poor Plenary Court met once, and never any second time.\" 1 During all that hatching of a Plenary Court, Besenval, Commandant of Paris, had continually questioned La moignon, Keeper of the Seals, \"Whether they had cash?\" To which the answer was ever, \" the cash is safe,\" for so Lomenie instructed ; and prudent Besenval, \" rejoined, that then all was safe.\" Whereas, the truth was, that the royal coffers were indeed nearly bare, and unless matters could be changed, would verily be full of nothing but blank emptiness. \" What shall a desperate Prime Minister do ? He has grasped at the strong box of the King's Theatre ; some lottery had been set on foot for those sufferers by the hail-storm. In his extreme necessity, Lomenie lays hands even on this. To make provision for the passing day, on any terms, will soon be impossible.\" 1 And now it is announced that the States-General are actually to meet in the following month of May, till after which period, \" this of the Plenary Court, and the rest, shall remain Postponed.\" How shall the States-General be formed ? France has not viewed this sight for so many years that all are at sea regarding the hows and wherefores. The perplexed Prime Minister has least idea of any one. But a bright thought strikes him. He will ask the opinions of others ; and so, \" thinkers are invited,\" through the medium of discussion and the press, to furnish him with some plan of action. \" What could a poor Minister do ? There are still months of respite reserved. A sinking pilot will fling out ail things, his very biscuit-bags, lead, log, compass, 1 Carlyle."], [157, "THE DIREFUL DEFICIT. 119 and quadrant, before flinging out himself. It is on this principle of sinking, and the incipient delirium of de spair, that we explain likewise the almost miraculous ' invitation to thinkers.' Invitation to Chaos to be so kind as build, out of its tumultuous drift-wood, an Ark of Escape for him ! In these cases, not invitation but command has usually proved serviceable. The queen stood, that evening, pensive, in a window, with her face turned towards the garden. The chef de gobelet had followed her with an obsequious cup of coffee ; and then retired till it were sipped. Her Majesty beckoned Dame Campan to approach: 'Grand Dieu!' murmured she, with the cup in her hand, ' what a piece of news will be made public to-day ! The king grants States-General.' Then raising her eyes to Heaven (if Campan were not mistaken), she added, \"Tis a first beat of the drum of ill-omen for France. This Noblesse will ruin us.' \" 1 This \"invitation to thinkers, and the great change now at hand, are enough to arrest the circulation of capital, and forward only that of pamphlets.\" A few thousand gold louis are now all that remain in the king's treasury. On the 16th of August criers go through the streets announcing an edict concerning payments, to this effect : \" All payments at the Royal Treasury shall be made, henceforth, three-fifths in cash, and the remaining two-fifths in paper bearing interest.\" The result of this action was a universal wail of indig nation, which soon grew to a seditious growl. The Court is at length aroused to a dim sense of danger. \" Monseign eur d'Artois, moved by Duchess Polignac, feels called to wait upon Her Majesty, and explain frankly what crisis matters stand in. The queen wept ; Brienne him self wept; for it is now visible and palpable that he must go.\" 1 Carlyle."], [158, "120 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. And behold, Lomenie de Brienne, Archbishop of Tou louse, finds that he has raised a breeze around his minis terial head, which will not calm ; nay, they change from whispering breezes straightway to roaring blasts of fury. He must now try exile ; the sovereign people so deter mine, and these sovereign people are speedily making their demands laivs, which not even royalty itself may much longer defiantly ignore. \" It remains only that the Court, to whom his manners and garrulities were always agreeable, shall make his fall soft. The grasping old man has already got his Arch bishopship of Toulouse exchanged for the richer one of Sens ; and now, in this hour of pity, he shall have the Coadjutorship for his nephew (hardly yet of due age), a Dameship of the Palace for his niece, a Regiment for her husband, for himself a red Cardinal's hat, a coupi de bois (cutting from the royal forests), and on the whole from five to six hundred thousand livres of revenue ; finally, his brother, the Comte de Brienne, shall still continue war-minister. Buckled round with such bol sters and huge feather-beds of promotion, let him now fall as soft as he can! \" And so Lomenie departs ; rich if Court-titles and Money-bonds can enrich him, but if these cannot, per haps the poorest of all extant men. ' Hissed at by the people of Versailles,' he drives forth to Jardi, southward to Brienne, then to Nice, to Italy ; but shall return, shall glide to and fro tremulous, faint-twinkling, fallen on awful times, till the Guillotine snuff out his weak exist ence.

His open profligacy and avowed infidelity were notorious. Louis had at one time refused to transfer him to the diocese of Paris, saying : '\u2022 that, at least, the Archbishop of the Metropolis ought to believe in God.\" And now behold, States-General, \"with a political Millennium,\" shall of a verity appear. \" How super fluous was that invitation of Lomehie's ; the invitation to thinkers !

Wherein the Tiers Etat was virtually a nonentity ; or at best, but ghost of any power. The Noblesse and Clergy had but to avoid quarrel amongst themselves, and all would go well.

This was the death-stroke of the popularity of the Paris Parliament aimed by its own hand against its own throat. If for a time, it weakly exists in name, its glory is forever departed.

Fatal decision ! which influenced the entire course of the Revolution. In Louis's mind the chase was uppermost. States-Gen eral might be expedient, but hunting for him was the paramount question."], [162, "124 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The people had not only been invited to think and to speak, but, still more surprising, an invitation had been sent to the people of the various provinces to draw up cahiers; or, in other words, to state all their grievances and their wants. Most marvellous ! No wonder the poor peasants imagined a millennium was speedily to appear. Down-trodden and dumb for centuries, they are now not only invited to speak, but to state their wants. When was it ever recognized before that the canaille could peradventure feel wants ? When Foulon, in pro posing some finance scheme of his, had been asked, on one occasion, \" What will the people do ? \" he haughtily rejoined, \" The people may eat grass.\" Ominous words, never forgotten ! Some day he should yet be forced by that same people to carry out his own prescription in an unforeseen and most ghastly manner. But now, not withstanding such as Foulon and others of his stamp, the people are to be distinguished from the brute crea tion, and may no longer be contemptuously ignored. In the mind of the lowest peasant there has dawned at length the thought that he has not only crying wants, but that he also has individual rights ; and when a peo ple become conscious of this fact, the throne of despot ism is menaced, and not only menaced, but will ere long totter and fall. Many of these special cahiers were very elaborately drawn up, notably those of the grocers, stocking-makers, and wholesale merchants in beer and cider, of Rouen, and that of the College of Physicians at Chartres. Many of the local politicians were engaged in drawing up these special cahiers, and Robespierre was employed by the cobblers of Arras to draw up the cahier of the Cordon niers Mineurs. The successful candidates at the primary assemblies formed the assembly of the Tiers Etat of the"], [163, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 125 various towns, who, after discussing the special cahiers of the people, drew up the cahier of the town, and then elected as many electors to the preliminary assembly of the Tiers Etat of the bailliage as had been prescribed by the reglemeut. These electors of the preliminary assem bly then met in their appointed cities, and reduced them selves to one-fourth their number, who were thereupon rec ognized as the electors of the deputies of the Tiers Etat to the States-General. These electors afterwards met with the noblesse and clergy of their respective bailliage or sinechaussee. The assembly so formed proceeded to elect their respective deputies. The elected deputies swore before their con stituents to bring the complaints and suggestions con tained in the various cahiers entrusted to them before the States-General, and to obey the directions given them. The local excitement caused by these elections was great in some districts, and was the occasion of so many quarrels between city and city, and bailliage and bail liage, that the government was obliged to issue a num ber of supplementary rtglements for special cases. It was at this time that Mirabeau united himself with the Tiers Etat. Rejected by the noblesse of his own bailliage on account of his previous bad character, and on the ground that he was not in possession of a fief, he there fore turned to the Tiers Etat and secured his election both at Aix and Marseilles. His election caused more enthusiasm than that of any other individual in all France. Lamartine thus comments upon Mirabeau : \u2014 \"Mirabeau did not invent the Revolution, but was its manifestation. But for him it might perhaps have remained in a state of idea and tendency. He was born a gentleman of ancient lineage, refugee and established"], [164, "126 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. in Provence, but of Italian origin; the progenitors were Tuscan. The blood of Michiavelli and the earthquake genius of the Italian republics were characteristics of all the individuals of this race. The source of genius is often in ancestry, and the blood of descent is sometimes the prophecy of destiny. \" Mirabeau's education was as rough and rude as the hand of his father, who was styled the Friend of Man, but whose restless spirit and selfish vanity rendered him the persecutor of his wife and the tyrant of his family. The only virtue taught to Mirabeau was that kind of honor by which name in those days they digni fied that ceremonious demeanor which was too frequently but the show of probity and the elegance of vice. En tering the army at an early age, he acquired nothing of military habits except a love of licentiousness and play. The hand of his father was constantly extended, not to aid him in rising, but to depress him still lower under the consequences of his errors ; his youth was passed in the prisons of the state ; his passions becoming enven omed by solitude, and his intellect being rendered more acute by contact with the irons of his dungeon, where his mind lost that modesty which rarely survives the infamy of precocious punishments. \" Released from jail in order, by his father's command, to attempt to form a marriage beset with difficulties with Mademoiselle de Marignan, a rich heiress of one of the greatest families of Provence, he displayed all kinds of stratagems and daring schemes of policy. He used every resource of his nature to succeed, and he succeeded ; but he was hardly married before fresh persecutions beset him, and the stronghold of Pontarlier gaped to enclose him. Freed from imprisonment by a lady whom he loved, he took refuge in Holland, but he was again"], [165, "127 THE STATES-GENERAL. seized and thrown into the dungeon of Vincennes. En tering obscure into his cell, he quitted it a writer, orator, statesman, but perverted, ripe for anything, even to sell himself, in order to obtain fortune and celebrity. The drama of life was conceived in his head ; he wanted but the stage, and that time was preparing for him. During the few short years which elapsed for him between his leaving the keep of Vincennes and the tribune of the National Assembly, he employed himself with polemic labors which would have weighed down another man, but which only kept him in health. The Bank of Saint Charles, the Institutions of Holland, the books on Prus sia, the skirmish with Beaumarchais, his style and char acter, his lengthened pleadings on questions of warfare, the balance of European power, finance, those biting invectives, that war of words with the ministers or men of the hour, resembled the Roman forum in the days of Clodius and Cicero. We discern the men of antiquity in even his most modern controversies. We may fancy that we hear the first roarings of those popular tumults which were so soon to burst forth, and which his voice was destined to control. \" At the first election of Aix, rejected with contempt by the noblesse, he cast himself into the arms of the people, certain of making the balance incline to the side on which he should cast the weight of his daring and of his genius. Marseilles contended with Aix for the great plebeian ; his two elections, the discourses he then deliv ered, the addresses he drew up, the energy he employed, commanded the attention of all France. His sonorous phrases became the proverbs of the Revolution ; comparing himself in his lofty language to the men of antiquity, he placed himself already in the public estimation in the ele vated position he aspired to reach. Men became accus-"], [166, "128 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. tomed to identify him with the names he cited ; he made a loud noise in order to prepare minds for great commo tions ; he announced himself proudly to the nation in that sublime apostrophe in his address to the Marseil lais : ' When the last of the Gracchi expired, he flung dust towards heaven, and from this dust sprung Marius ! Marius, less great for having exterminated the Cimbri, than for having prostrated in Rome the aristocracy of the nobility.' \" From the moment of his entry into the National Assembly he filled it; he was the whole people. His gestures were commands, his movements coups d'etat. He placed himself on a level with the throne, and the nobility felt itself subdued by a power emanating from its own body. The clergy, which is the people, and de sires to reconcile the democracy with the Church, lends him its influence, in order to destroy the double aristoc racy of the nobility and bishops. \"All that had been built by antiquity and cemented by ages fell in a few months. Mirabeau alone preserved his presence of mind in the midst of this ruin. His character of tribune ceases, that of the statesman begins, and in this he is even greater than in the other. There, when all else creep and crawl, he acts with firmness, advancing boldly. The Revolution in his brain is no longer a momentary idea ; it is a settled plan. The phil osophy of the eighteenth century, moderated by the prudence of policy, flows easily, and modelled from his lips. His eloquence, imperative as the law, is now the talent of giving force to reason. His language inspires everything, and though almost alone at this moment, he has the courage to remain alone. He braves envy, hatred, murmurs, supported by the strong feeling of his superiority. He dismisses writh disdain the passions"], [167, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 129 which have hitherto beset him. He will no longer serve them when his cause no longer needs them. He speaks to men now only in the name of his genius. This title is enough to cause obedience to him. His power is based on the assent which truth finds in all minds, and his strength again reverts to him. He contests with all parties, and rises superior to one and all. All hate him because he commands, and all seek him because he can serve or destroy them. He does not give himself up to any one, but negotiates with each ; he lays down calmly on the tumultuous element of this assembly, the basis of the reformed constitution: legislation, finance, diplomacy, war, religion, political economy, balances of power, \u2014 every question he approaches and solves, not as an Utopian, but as a politician. The solution he gives is always the precise mean between the theoretical and the practical. He places reason on a level with man ners, and the institutions of the land in consonance with its habits. He desires a throne to support the democ racy, liberty in the chambers, and the will of the nation, one and irresistible in the government. \" The characteristic of his genius, so well defined, so ill understood, was less audacity than justness. Beneath the grandeur of his expression is always to be found unfailing good sense. His very vices could not repress the clearness, the sincerity of his understanding. At the foot of the tribune he was a man devoid of shame or virtue ; in the tribune he was an honest man. Aban doned to private debauchery, bought over by foreign powers, sold to the court in order to satisfy his lavish expenditure, he preserved, amidst all this infamous traf fic of his powers, the incorruptibility of his genius. \" Of all the qualities of a great man of his age, he was only wanting in honesty.

His dying words were 'sprinkle me with perfumes, crown me with flowers, that I may thus enter upon eternal sleep.' He was espe cially of his time, and his course bears no impress of infinity. Neither his character, his acts, nor his thoughts have the brand of immortality. If he had believed in God, he might have died a martyr, but he would have left behind him the religion of reason and the reign of democracy. Mirabeau, in a word, was the reason of the people ; and that is not yet the faith of humanity ! \" Michelet says of Mirabeau : \" His immense mass of hair, his lion-like head, stamped with extreme ugliness, were astounding, almost frightful ; nobody could take his eyes off him. He, indeed was visibly a man, and the others were but shadows ; a man, unfortunately, of his time and class, vicious, like the higher society of the day; moreover, scandalous, noisy, and courageous in vice : that is what ruined him. The world was full of the romance of his adventures, vices, and passions. And the tyranny of those passions so exacting and absorbing, had often led him very low. Poor by the harsh treat ment of his family, he suffered moral misery, the vices of the poor besides those of the rich. Family tyranny, state tyranny, moral internal tyranny, \u2014 that of passion. Ah ! nobody could hail more fervently that aurora of liberty. He did not despair of there finding liberty, the regeneration of the soul ; he used to say so to his friends.

No matter! He still bore his enormous head erect, and his looks were full of audacity. Everybody seemed to forebode in him the loud appalling voice of France.\" But now while National Deputies gather in Paris from all parts of France, the people grow uneasy, then riotous. Why should the ungrateful people murmur? Are not the States-General actually assembling ? Will they not shortly be assembled, and will they not work wonders ? Yes, verily, perchance ; but the people, mean while, must eat or die, and they are starving. A rumor comes to them that one Reveillon, a paper manufacturer, having risen to wealth, was heard to say that \"a journeyman might live handsomely on fifteen sous a day,\" \u2014 some seven pence halfpenny ! Whether he said it or not matters little with the starving populace. It is so reported ; that is enough for the mob. Such trades men must be taught a lesson. Saint- Antoine rises ma jestic in anger. The paper-warehouse is straightway demolished. Reveillon would also perchance have been demolished, but he is prudently in hiding. And Saint- Antoine, having given this needful lesson to the moneyed class, retires, and waits the coming of the States-General and supposed millennium. The States-General have at length assembled. King Louis receives them at Versailles. But ominous, bode ful of much ! For the nobility and clergy, both of the royal folding doors are open ; for the third estate, only one. Never mind ! Such a slight discourtesy, or court etiquette, may be pardoned."], [170, "132 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. On the 4th of May, the Deputies gather in the Church of Notre Dame, twelve hundred strong. From thence they are to march in procession to the Church of St. Louis. All of France looks on breathless. It is affirmed that five millions of men took part in the elections which have produced this memorable States-General. The nation has arisen \u2014 it has spoken \u2014 it will soon demand. Necker has been recalled. Surely the people's minister and the States-General will accomplish much. In this charming May weather all things smile. The earth smiles in beauty; men smile in hope. Gorgeous is the spectacle of Notre Dame. The Marquis de Ferri eres thus describes the scene : \u2014 \" The nobility wore black coats, the other garments of cloth of gold ; silk cloak, lace cravat, plumed hat, turned up d, la Henri IV. ; the clergy in surplice, wide mantle, square cap ; the bishops in their purple robes, with their rochets; the tiers dressed in black, with silk mantle and cambric cravat. The King placed himself on a plat form richly decorated ; Monsieur the Count d'Artois, the princes, the ministers, the great officers of the Crown, were seated below the King ; the Queen placed herself opposite to the King; Madame the Countess d'Artois, the princesses, the ladies of the court, superbly dressed, and covered with diamonds, composed a magnificent retinue for her. \"The streets were hung with tapestry belonging to the crown ; the regiments of the French and Swiss guards formed a line from Notre Dame to St. Louis ; an immense concourse of people looked on, as we passed, in respectful silence; the balconies were adorned with costly stuffs, the windows filled with spectators of all ages, of both sexes ; lovely women elegantly attired ; every face bespoke kindly emotion, every eye sparkled"], [171, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 133 with joy ; clapping of hands, expressions of the warmest interest, the looks that met us, and that still followed after we were out of sight ; . . . rapturous, enchanting scene, to which I should vainly strive to do justice. Bands of music, placed at intervals, rent the air with melodious sounds ; military marches, the rolling of drums, the clang of trumpets, the noble chants of the priests, alternately heard, without discordance, without confusion, enlivened this triumphal procession to the Temple of the Almighty. \" On their arrival at St. Louis, the three orders seated themselves on benches placed in the nave. The King and Queen took their places beneath a canopy of purple velvet, sprinkled with golden fleurs-de-lis ; the princes, the princesses, the great officers of the crown, and the ladies of the palace occupied the space reserved for their Majesties. The Bishop of Nanci delivered the discourse. The host was carried to the altar to the sound of the most impressive music. It was an 0 salutaris Hostia ! \" But all eyes have not gazed through the rose-colored glasses of the Marquis de Ferrieres. The people had noticed many things. Plain black cloaks had been im posed upon the deputies of the Tiers Etat, while the noblesse and clergy blazed with unwonted splendor. The Commons had been commanded \" not to wear that hated slouch-hat (chapeau clabaud), but one not quite so slouched (chapeau rabattu).\" This sight irritated the people, and their vivats arose only when the black cloaks passed in procession, while their voices partook of an ominous murmur of disapproval when the higher orders appeared. Again, in the Church of St. Louis, marked distinctions had been made in the reception of the three orders. Trifles, say you ? Yes, trifles, indeed. But trifles often show which way the wind blows."], [172, "134 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The opening of the States-General took place on the 5th of May, 1789, in the Salle des Menus; this good Louis has prepared for them, and even watched the workmen with his royal eyes. \" A spacious Hall ; with raised platform for Throne, Court, and Blood-Royal ; space for six hundred Commons Deputies in front ; for half as many Clergy on this hand, and half as many Noblesse on that. It has lofty galleries; wherefrom dames of honor, splendent in gaze d'or, foreign Diplo macies, and other gilt-edged, white-frilled individuals, to the number of two thousand, may sit and look. Broad passages flow through it ; and, outside the inner wall, all round it. There are committee-rooms, guard-rooms, rob ing-rooms ; really a noble Hall ; where upholstery, aided by the subject fine-arts, has done its best; and crimson tasseled cloths, and emblematic fleurs-de-lis are not want ing.\" ' And now the Deputies are installed, for the first time, in their splendid Salle des Menus. \" The King from his estrade, gorgeous as Solomon in all his glory, runs his eye over that majestic Hall ; many-plumed, many-glanc ing, bright-tinted as a rainbow, in the galleries and near side-spaces, where Beauty sits raining bright influence.\" Satisfaction beams on the good-natured face of Louis. He thinks he has reached the end of his threatening perils. He rises kingly, though unmajestic, and de claims for a certain time. \" Gentlemen, the day I have so anxiously expected has at length arrived, and I see around me the representatives of the nation which I glory in governing.\" Propitious beginning, surely ; but the fact of Louis's governing, or want of governing, threw just a shade of irony in the meaning. But the expec tant people hailed him with vivats and listened on, 1 Carlyle."], [173, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 135 watching to catch some word of solid hope to rest upon. His speech closed with these words : \" All that can be expected from the dearest interest in the public welfare, all that can be required of a sovereign, the first friend of his people, you may and ought to hope from my senti ments. That a happy spirit of union may pervade this Assembly, gentlemen, and that this may be an ever memorable epoch for the happiness and prosperity of the kingdom, is the wish of my heart, the most ardent of my desires ; it is, in a word, the reward which I ex pect for the uprightness of my intentions, and my love of my subjects.\" Poor Louis ! he has yet to learn that the uprightness of intentions and the love of his subjects were not the only requisites for the successful government of France. The Keeper of the Seals then followed in a one hour's discourse, which gave to the waiting expectant people little satisfaction. Necker then rose. Now the people again breathed more freely ; here was their looked-for help. But Necker, though he talked for two long hours, and dilated much on patriotism, faith, and hope, men tioned nothing tangible, but the dreadful deficit. The government must have money, and the j^eople must pay. The same old story. \"We remark only, that, as his Majesty, on finishing his speech, put on his plumed hat, the Noblesse, according to custom, imitated him ; our Tiers Etat Deputies did mostly, not without a shade of fierceness, in like manner clap-on, and even crush-on their slouched hats, and stand there awaiting the issue. Thick buzz among them, between majority and minority of Couvrez-vous, Decouvrez-vous (Hats off, Hats on) ! To which his Majesty puts end by taking ojf his own royal hat again.\" And so the States-General have met and for the day"], [174, "136 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. been dismissed, and what has been accomplished ? The people have been told with high-flown eloquence and kingly benediction, that the royal treasury is empty, and it is more than vaguely hinted that the people will be called upon to fill it. The people, indeed ! already eating bread only fit for dogs, or else browsing with the sheep in the fields ; or worse, starving, having neither black bread nor even the fern of the sheep between them and actual starvation. \" There is the indisputablest scarcity of corn. Be it Aristocrat-plot, D'Orleans-plot of this year, or drought and hail of last year, in city and prov ince, the poor man looks desolately towards a nameless lot.\" Whether it is the infamous Famine Pact, forcing a scarcity that the pockets of monopolists may be filled, even though the people's mouths must thereby be empty ; most diabolical scheme which it seems only demons could originate, \u2014 trafficking in the lives and tortures of an entire populace, \u2014 be it Famine Pact, or taxes, or tem pests ; the canaille are dying from hunger, and the court and ministers, and even their heretofore adored idol of royalty, demand of this dying people the last drop of their very life-blood. Poor people ! we have now only pity for you ; in this stage of the Revolution, your case only causes our tears of sympathy to flow. Later on, however, our pity must be withdrawn from you and given to your victims, even though those victims have been your greatest enemies. But now we are forced to exclaim with Michelet, \u2014 \"Oh, heaven ! oh, earth ! oh, justice !

Suffer and die ! be it so. But to suffer by election, to die through mere necessity, \u2014 oh, that is too much, too much by half. Kind-hearted men, you who weep over the evils of the Revolution (doubtless with too much reason), shed also a few tears for the evils which occasioned it. Come and see, I be seech you, this people lying in the dust, like poor Job, amid their false friends, their patrons, their influential protectors, \u2014 the clergy and royalty. Behold the look of anguish that they turn upon their king without speak ing. What language is in that look ! ' Oh, King ! whom I made my god, to whom I erected an altar, and to whom I prayed even before God himself ; from whom, in the jaws of death, I implored for salvation ; you, my only hope, you, whom I have adored, \u2014 what! have you then felt nothing?' \"Louis XIV. is severe at first, \u2014 no exemption from taxes. Colbert cancels 40,000 of them. The country thrives. But Louis XIV. grows good-natured. He is more and more affected by the fate of the poor nobility ; everything is for them, \u2014 grades, places, pensions, even benefices, and Saint-Cyr for noble young ladies. The nobility flourishes, and France is at her last extremity. \" Louis XVI. is also severe at first ; grumbles, and even refuses. The courtiers jest bitterly about his incivility and rough answers (coups de boutoir). The reason is, he has a bad minister, \u2014 that inflexible Turgot, \u2014 and alas ! the queen has no power yet. In 1778 the king at last yields.

The king, so parsimonious till then, buys Rambouillet. Vaudreuil, the disinterested friend of the Count d'Artois, will receive nothing. He sells to the crown, for a mil lion, his estates in America, receives them back and keeps them. Who can say what sums Diane de Poli gnac, by cleverly directing Jules de Polignac, managed to secure ? \"The Revolution spoiled all. It roughly tore aside the graceful veil that masked the public ruin. The inflexible reporter of the Committee of Finances ac quainted the Assembly with a mystery unknown to every body ; ' in expenditure, the king is the sole director:' The only standard of expenditure was the king's good nature. Too tender-hearted to refuse \u2014 to grieve those whom he saw about him \u2014 he found himself in reality dependent on them. At the slightest inclination towards economy they were moody and sullen. He was obliged to yield. Several of them were still bolder ; they spoke out, loud and resolutely, and took the king to task. M. de Coigny refused to submit to a retrenchment which they had proposed in one of his enormous pensions ; a scene ensued, and he got into a passion with Louis XVI. The king shrugged up his shoulders, and made no answer. In the evening he said, ' Indeed, had he beaten me, I should have submitted to it.' \" No noble family in difficulties, no illustrious mother marrying her daughter and son, but draws money from the king. ' Those great families contribute to the splen dor of the monarchy and the glory of the throne,' etc. The king signs with a heavy heart, and copies into his Red Book, ' To Madame 500,000 francs.' The lady carries the order to the minister. 'I have no money, Madame.' She insists, threatens ; she may be trouble-"], [177, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 139 some, being in high favor with the queen. The minister ultimately finds the money. He will rather postpone, like Lomenie, the payment of the small pensioners. Let them starve, if they will ; or else, as he did, he will take the charitable funds intended to repair the disasters of storms and fires ; nay, even plunder the funds of the hospitals. \"France is in good hands. Everything is going on well. So good-natured a king, such an amiable queen. The only difficulty is that independently of the privi leged paupers at Versailles, there is another class, no less noble, and far more numerous, the provincial privileged paupers, who have nothing, receive nothing, say they ; they rend the air with their exclamations. Those men, long before the people, will begin the Revolution. \" By-the-by, there is a people. Between these paupers and those paupers, who are all persons of fortune, we had forgotten the people. The People ! Oh ! that is the business of the farmers of the revenue. Things are altered. Formerly, financiers were hard-hearted men. Now, they are all philanthropists, kind, amiable, and magnificent ; with one hand they starve, it is true ; but often they nourish with the other. They reduce thou sands to beggary, and give alms. They build hospitals, and fill them. \"Persepolis, says Voltaire, in one of his stories, 'has thirty kings of finance, who draw millions from the peo ple, and give a little to the king.' Out of the gabelle (salt-tax), for instance, which brought in one hundred and twenty millions, the Ferme Generate kept back sixty, and deigned to leave some fifty or sixty for the king. \" Tax-gathering was nothing but an organized warfare ; it caused an army of two hundred thousand drones to oppress the soil. Those locusts devoured, wasted every-"], [178, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 140 thing. To drain substance out of a people, thus devoured, it was necessary to have cruel laws, terrible penalties, the galleys, gibbets, racks. The farming agents were authorized to employ arms ; they murdered, and were afterwards judged by the special tribunals of the Ferme Generate. The most shocking part of the system was the easy good nature of the king and the farmers of the revenue. On one hand the king, on the other the thirty kings of the exchequer, gave away (or sold cheap) ex emptions from taxation ; the king created nobles ; the farmers created for themselves fictitious employe's, who, under that title, were exempt. Thus, the exchequer was working against itself; whilst it was augmenting the sum to be paid, it diminished the number of the payers ; the load, weighing upon fewer shoulders, became more and more oppressive. The two privileged orders paid whatever they pleased ; the clergy a gratuitous non-col lectible tax ; the nobles contributed for certain imposts, but according to whatever they thought proper to de clare, which the treasury agents registered with a bow, without either examination or verification. The neigh bors had to pay so much the more.\" In connection with that memorable assembling of the States-General in the gorgeous Salle des Menus, the fol lowing incident is not without interest. \" Two ladies of rank from a gallery, beheld the spectacle with very differ ent feelings. The one was Madame de Montmorin, wife of the minister of foreign affairs ; the other, the illustrious daughter of M. Necker, Madame de Stael. The latter exulted in the boundless prospect of national felicity which seemed to be opening under the auspices of her father. 'You are wrong to rejoice,' said Madame de Montmorin; 'this event forbodes much misery to France and to ourselves.' Her presentiment turned out"], [179, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 141 too well founded; she herself perished on the scaffold with one of her sons ; another was drowned ; her hus band was massacred in the prisons on September 2d ; her eldest daughter was cut off in jail; her youngest died of a broken heart before she had attained the age of thirty years.\" On the 6th of May the deputies of the Tiers Etat assembled in the large hall and waited in vain for the other orders. The nobility and clergy met apart in their respective rooms, and seemed in no way disposed to acknowledge the equal power of the third estate. So the third waited for the clergy and the noblesse. A month was lost. Starving gangs overran the country, plundering, burning, and even killing. A rumor spread that these brigands were paid by the court. The court flung the accusation back on the Duke of Orleans. Mira beau had meanwhile been publishing his journal under the title of \" Letters to my Constituents.\" A previous paper, issued by him on the day of the opening of the States-General, had been suppressed by a decree of the Council. So Mirabeau wrote, and talked, and the third estate waited, and the clergy and noblesse remained obdurate. On the 10th of June, Sieyes exclaimed in the Assembly : \" Let us cut the cable ! it is time.\" It was indeed time, and the cable was speedily cut. An army of Swiss and German troops surrounded Versailles, and a battery of cannon was before the Assembly. But nothing could restrain the Tiers Etat when they had once resolved to move. The Assembly has spoken; it is now about to act. But they wisely conclude not to be too precipitous. They will inform the other orders that they await their coming. Deputations are accord ingly sent to the clergy and nobility, reminding them that the third estate have assembled and await their"], [180, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 142 appearance. The court, clergy, and noblesse thereupon confer together, and decide to remain apart. Having offered the pipe of peace in vain, the Tiers Etat, will now prepare for war. Five weeks had already elapsed in useless parleys. Now the third estate would act. \" What title should the Assembly assume ? This was a question of immense importance. It was, so to speak, the baptism of the Revolution, which was now taking place. All felt themselves at the beginning of a new world.\" Barrere, a young Deputy, said to the representatives of the Commons : \" You are called upon to recommence history.\" Many titles were proposed, but the debate was chiefly between Siey&s and Mirabeau. On the morn ing of the 17th of June, Sieyes arose and said : \" I pro pose the title of the National Assembly.\" The thought was an inspiration, and his motion was carried by a large majority. Henri Martin says : \" This day was the last of the Ancient Regime. This day, demo cratic unity replaced the Three Orders of the ancient society, and the Sovereignty of the Nation replaced the Sovereignty of the King.\" Thus had the Tiers Etat settled for themselves the vexed question which had agitated the entire nation, as to \" voting by head or by order \" : the nation could now vote according to the majority of its true representa tives, the Tiers Etat. Behold what consternation at the court ! But the most surprised of all was Necker. He had imagined that he could lead the world ; and here were his pupils, the people, whom he had assured the king would be so docile, without consulting their tutor, taking the reins into their own hands, and might even force their master to be led. \" On the evening of the 17th the heads of the clergy,"], [181, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 143 Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld and the Archbishop of Paris, had hastened to Marly, and implored the king and queen. On the 19th there were vain disputes in the Cham ber of the nobility ; Orleans proposed to join the third, and Montesquieu to unite with the clergy. But there was no longer any order of the clergy. The very same day, the cure's had transferred the majority of their order to form a union with the third, and thus divided the order into two. The cardinal and the archbishop return the same evening to Marly, and fall at the feet of the king : ' Religion is ruined ! ' they cry. Next came the Parlia ment people : ' The monarchy is lost, unless the States be dissolved.' \"A dangerous advice, and already impossible to fol low. The flood was rising higher every hour. Versailles and Paris were in commotion. Necker had persuaded two or three of the ministers, and even the king, that his project was the only means of salvation. That pro ject had been read over again in a last and definite coun cil on Friday evening, the 19th ; everything was finished and agreed : ' The portfolios were already being shut up,' says Necker, ' when one of the royal servants sud denly entered ; he whispered to the king ; and His Majesty immediately arose, commanding his ministers to remain in their places. M. de Montmorin, sitting by my side, said to me : \" We have effected nothing ; the queen alone could have ventured to interrupt the Council of State ; the princes, apparently, have circumvented her.\" ' \" * The proposed measures of Necker were not carried out. The king, still undecided, only commanded that the hall should be shut on the morrow. He thus hoped to prevent the clergy from uniting with the third estate.

But, nevertheless, Bailly proceeded to the hall as usual, the next morning ; and when the members assem bled, they were met by sentinels who refused them en trance. \" It is shut, this Salle ; occupied by Gardes Francaises.\" \"Where is your captain ? \" \"The captain shows his royal order : workman, he is grieved to say, are all busy setting up the platform for his Majesty's Seance; most unfortunately, no admission; admission, at furthest for President and Secretaries to bring away papers, which the joiners might destroy ! \" What shall be done ?

Some table can be procured to write on ; some chair, if not to sit on, then to stand on. The secretaries undo their tapes !

On the 22d the Assembly were still deprived of their hall, and unable again to make use of the Tennis-Court, as the Count d'Artois had pur posely hired it that it might be refused them. \"The Assembly found itself once more in the open streets of Versailles, wandering about without house or home. Fine amusement for the court ! The master of the hall was afraid ; he feared the princes. The Assem bly does not succeed better at the door of the Recollets, where it next knocks ; the monks dare not compromise themselves. Who then are these vagrants, this danger ous band, before whom every door is shut? Nothing less than the Nation itself. But why not deliberate in the open air ? What more noble canopy than the sky ? But on that day the majority of the clergy wish to come and sit with the commons. Where are they to receive them ? Luckily, the hundred and thirty-four curis, with a few prelates at their head, had already taken up their quarters in the morning in the Church of St. Louis'. The Assembly was introduced there into the nave ; and the ecclesiastics at first assembled in the choir, then came forth, and took their places among its members.

Admittance is obtained. The deputies filing in find the nobility and clergy already in their places, as though their judges awaiting them. The king entered with much ceremony and pomp, but was received with profound silence. He proceeded to read the speech prepared for him, which was couched in the most despotic language. The king closed his harangue with the wrords : \" If you abandon me in so excellent an enterprise, I will alone effect the welfare of my people ; alone, I shall consider myself as their true representative! I order you, gentlemen, to disperse immediately, and to repair to-morrow morning to the chambers appropriated to your order, there to resume your sitting.\" The king then departed, followed by the nobility and some of the clergy. The master of the ceremonies then entered, and said to the president of the Assembly : \" Sir, you heard the king's order!\" Bailly replied: \"The Assembly adjourned after the royal meeting ; I cannot dismiss it till it has deliberated. It seems to me that the assembled nation cannot receive any orders.\" Still the punctilious Brez6, loyal to the sanctity of his master's ceremonial etiquette, hesitated. Whereupon Mirabeau"], [188, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 148 rose, with flashing eyes and defiant mien, and exclaimed in thunder tones : \" We have heard the intentions sug gested to the king ; and you, sir, who can never be his organ to the National Assembly, you, who have here neither place, voice, nor right to speak ; you are not a man to remind us of his discourse. Go and tell those who send you, that we are here by the will of the peo ple, and are to be driven hence only by the power of bayonets.\" Breze, disconcerted, retired from the room backwards, thus unconsciously, or peradventure purposely, rendering homage to the new royalty. \" You are to-day what you were yesterday,\" said Sieyes to the Assembly calmly. \" Let us deliberate.\" Brez\u00a3, thunderstruck, reported the unheard-of news to the king and court. The Assembly will not be dis missed ! Louis walks his palace floor with excitement. The queen and princes and court ladies look aghast. What will the king do ? is on every tongue and in every eye. Baffled Louis presently turns around, and exclaims, \" Let them stay ! \" Futile has proved this coup d'itat of the court. All France is looking on. Ten thousand people surge and sway in the Palais Royal, the assembly ground of the mob and masses. Necker, who had declined to take part in the Royal Session, had been dismissed that morning, but had been recalled that same evening. The Gardes Franeaises had refused to take up arms against the peo ple surrounding the building of the States-General. Whereupon the commandant of Paris, Baron de Besen val, had dismissed them in disgrace to their barracks. The court now began to be afraid, and sent for foreign troops, and placed them at Versailles, under the command of the Marechal de Broglie. On the 27th of June the"], [189, "THE S TA TES- GENERAL. 149 king was obliged to compromise his dignity by command ing the clergy and noblesse to unite with the third estate. Even the court and king perceive how futile and unwise have been their measures ; and by an edict of the royal authority the vanquished nobles and clergy are forced to eat very humble pie; even to sneak crest-fallen into the Assembly, thus acknowledging their defeat in the presence of the despised Tiers Etat. Some of the nobles, among them La Fayette and the Due d'Orleans, with many of the clergy, had already joined the third estate. Wild rumors were now spread throughout Paris. It was reported that the king was about to dissolve the National Assembly, and declare the State bankrupt, and starve Paris to submission. The National Assembly addressed a memorial to the king, requesting him to remove the foreign troops from Versailles, which were looked upon by the people as hostile signs towards them. But Louis refused, and curtly informed the States-Gen eral if they took exception to this measure they could migrate to Noyon or Soissons, where there were no troops to intimidate them. On the 12th of July rumor spread through the capital that Necker had been dismissed. The streets were pla carded with large printed sheets headed, \" In the name of the King,\" and counselling all citizens not to be alarmed, and warning the people not to collect in crowds. What do these mysterious signs import? The masses throng the walks and cafes of the Palais Royal. Soon the cry is heard, \"Necker is dismissed!\" A young man named Camille Desmoulins, already distinguished as the author of a book entitled, \"Free France,\" mounted a table in the Palais Royal, and with a pistol in hand, exclaimed: \"Citizens, there is not a moment to lose."], [190, "150 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The dismissal of M. Necker is the alarm bell of the St. Bartholomew of Patriots. This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all ; one resource is left \u2014 to take up arms. \" Shouts of applause greeted this proposal. \" What shall be the color of our cockades ? \" he cried. \" Shall they be green, the color of hope ; or red, the color of the free order of Cincinnatus ? \" \" Green ! \" shouted the multitude. And Desmoulins descended from his improvised tribune, and fastened a sprig from a tree in his hat. Instantly his example was followed. The chestnut-trees were nearly stripped of their leaves, and the crowd went in tumult to the house of the sculptor Curtius, and taking the busts of Necker and the Duke of Orleans, whom rumor declared was also to be banished, they covered them with crape, and bore them in triumph at the head of an unruly procession, which was every moment augmented in numbers from neighboring streets. Reaching the Place Vend6me, the busts were carried twice around the statue of Louis XIV. After proceed ing to the Place Louis XV., they were met by the dra goons of the Prince de Lambesc, and after a conflict, in which three or four were killed, the mob was at length dispersed to spread sullenly throughout the city wild rumors of tyranny and revolt, and the night of the 12th of July but added the uncertainty of darkness to the other alarms of constant commotion and riotous dis orders. The most infamous calumnies were circulated about the queen. Arthur Young, then travelling in France, declares that it was reported to him \"that the queen had a plot, nearly on the point of execution, to blow up the National Assembly by a mine, and to march the army instantly to massacre all Paris.\" And a week"], [191, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 151 later he was assured \" that the queen had been convicted of a plot to poison the king and Monsieur, and give the Regency to the Count d'Artois, to set fire to Paris, and blow up the Palais Royal by a mine.\" Whereas at this same time this poor maligned queen was writing to Madame de Polignac : \" I have courage, and provided that the honest folks support us without exposing themselves needlessly, I think that I have vigor enough in myself to impart some to others. But it is more than ever necessary to bear in mind that all classes of men, so long as they are honest, are equally our sub jects, and to know how to distinguish those who are right thinking in every district and in every rank. My God ! if people could only believe that these are my real thoughts, perhaps they would love me a little. But I must not think of myself. The glory of the King, that of his son, and the happiness of this ungrateful nation are all that I can, all that I ought, to wish for.\" And to another she said : \" You are not to think of me for a moment ; all that I desire of you is to take care that the respect which is due to the King shall not be weakened.\" To arms ! To arms ! is the cry in Paris, hourly in creasing in volume. The court at Versailles remained apparently motionless, surrounded by its German troops under Marechal de Broglie. Besenval, the Paris com mandant, receiving no orders from Broglie, observing the riot increasing, posted Swiss troops in the Champs Elys6es, with four pieces of cannon, and drew up his German cavalry on the Place Louis XV Knowing that his French Guards would fraternize with the people, he did not dare to make use of them, but kept them con fined in their barracks. It was Sunday, and the gardens of the Tuileries were"], [192, "152 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. filled with people; mostly quiet crowds taking their usual walks. The sight of the German soldiers drawn up in order of battle inflamed them. Men and children threw stones at the hated troops. Besenval, fearing reproach from Versailles should he calmly allow such actions without punishment, gave orders to his dragoons to march on the people. The soldiers, obeying this order, advanced, and some of the crowd were trampled under the feet of their horses. At the gate of the gar dens barricades of chairs had hastily been thrown up> by the people, and the troops were assailed by showers of stones and bottles hurled at them by the now frenzied mob. The order was given to fire ; a few were wounded, and Prince Lambesc, who led the troops, had the human ity to retire with his soldiers. But the evil was done. The crowd, rushing in all directions from the gardens of the Tuileries, spread wild accounts of the brutality of the Germans in driving their horses against women and children. The alarm bell rang. The increasing mob hastened to the H6tel de Ville to demand arms. They over powered the guards, pushed down the barriers, invaded the hall, and appeared before the electors, and demanded arms. The electors declined the responsibility of author izing the insurrection ; but the people now take the mat ter into their own hands. Some of the French Guards, escaped from their barracks, marched against the Ger mans, killed three of the cavalry on the Boulevard, and then marched to the Place Louis XV., which they found deserted. So passed Sunday. On Monday, July 13th, the tumult steadily increased. In spite of the efforts of the electors, who had run about all the previous night beseeching the people to lay down their arms, everybody who could find, snatch, or steal gun, pike, or club, was"], [193, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 153 arming. At six o'clock on Monday morning all the bells in all the churches were sounding the alarm. On this day Flesselles, the mayor or provost of Paris, was sum moned by the king to Versailles, and by the people to the H6tel de Ville. He thought it better policy to obey the summons of the crowd, and repaired to the H6tel de Ville, and there soothingly exclaimed to the people, \" You shall be satisfied, my friends ; I am your father.\" Meanwhile the twenty thousand beggars employed at Montmartre threw aside their spades and came pouring into the city to augment the crowds now swarming through the streets. The starving population from the rural districts turned their faces towards Paris. \"The city was peopled by famine.\" A report arises, \" There is corn at Saint-Lazare.\" The crowds ran thither, found indeed fifty carts full of flour amassed by the friars. These were swiftly driven to market. The prisoners of La Force, who were confined for debt, were set at liberty by the people, who exercised, however, some sort of dis cretion, for they forced the criminals of La Chatelet, who were already breaking clown the doors of their prison, to retire again to their cells. The electors, being unable to defer any longer the arming, attempted to keep it within limits. The question of subsistence was as urgent as that of arms. Paris must starve or conquer. The courage of the people was immense. They were willing to fight to the death; but with what? empty fists ? Arms ! guns ! and powder ! was the constant cry. The arsenal is said to be empty. But some spies placed on guard report a large quantity of powder being prepared to be secretly embarked for Rouen. The peo ple seize it. A brave abbe, Lefebvre d'Ormesson, stands forty-eight hours over that volcano, guarding it and dis tributing the powder to the people. Several times he"], [194, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 154 is fired at ; a drunken man sits smoking upon an open cask ; but the abbe remains at his dangerous post. Now they have powder, where shall they obtain guns ? Somewhere in Paris there is known to be a large mag azine of them. But where ? Flesselles, urged to point out the depot, declares that he is expecting twelve thou sand from the manufactory. To support this falsehood, twelve wagons are seen passing through La Greve, in scribed \"Artilleries The people secure them \u2014 open them \u2014 and find, not guns, but rags. The now furious people cry treason ! and Flesselles, fearing for his life, tries to appease them, and directs them to the Celestin and the Chartreux friars, saying, \"The monks have arms ! \" The kindly monks open their door willingly ; not a gun can be found. The electors authorized the manufacture of pikes. Fifty thousand were forged in thirty-six hours. Yet even such despatch seems too slow for the pressing crisis. The people are at length reliably informed that there is a large depot of arms at the In valides. They send deputies that same evening to Be senval, the commandant, and Sombreuil, the governor of the H6tel. \" I will write to Versailles about it,\" replied Besenval. Accordingly he notified the Mareshal de Broglie, but received no answer. \"This inconceivable silence was doubtless owing to the complete disorder that reigned in the council ; all differing on every point, excepting a very decided one, the dissolution of the National Assembly. It was like wise owing to the misconception of the court, who, over cunning and subtle, looked upon that great insurrection as the effect of a petty intrigue, believed that the Palais Royal did everything, and the Duke of Orleans paid for it. A puerile explanation. Is it possible to bribe mil lions of men ? Had the Duke paid also the insurrec-"], [195, "COMMOTION AT THE PALAIS ROYAL."], [196, ""], [197, "THE STATES-GENERAL. 155 tions at Lyons and in Dauphins, which, at that moment, had loudly refused to pay the taxes ? Had he bribed the cities of Brittany, which were rising up in arms, or the soldiers, who, at Rennes, refused to fire upon the citizens ? \"The prince's effigy had, it is true, been carried in triumph. But the prince himself had come to Versailles to surrender to his enemies, and to protest that he was as much afraid of the riot as anybody, or even more so. He was requested to have the goodness to sleep at the castle. The court, having him under its hand, thought it held fast the fabricator of the whole machination, and felt more at its ease. The old marshal, to whom all the military forces were intrusted at that moment, surrounded himself well with troops, held the king in safety, put Versailles, which nobody thought of, in a state of de fence, and, looking upon the insurrection of Paris as so much smoke, left it to subside of itself.\" J Thiers says : \" The garden of the Palais Royal was the theatre of the most numerous assemblages. This magnificent garden, surrounded by the richest shops in Europe, and forming an appurtenance to the palace of the Duke of Orleans, was the rendezvous of foreigners, of debauchees, of loungers, and, above all, of the most vehement agitators. The boldest harangues were de livered in the coffee-houses, or in the garden itself. There might be seen an orator mounted upon a table, collecting a crowd around him, and exciting them by the most furious language \u2014 language always unpun ished; for there the mob reigned as sovereign. Here men, supposed to be the tools of the Duke of Orleans, displayed the greatest violence. The wealth of that prince, his well-known prodigality, the enormous sums 1 Michelet."], [198, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 156 which he borrowed, his residence on the spot, his am bition, though vague, all served to point accusation against him. History, without mentioning any name, is authorized, at least, to declare that money was pro fusely distributed. If the sound part of the nation was ardently desirous of liberty ; if the restless and suffering multitude resorted to agitation for the purpose of better ing its condition, there were instigators who sometimes excited that multitude, and perhaps directed some of its blows. In other respects, this influence is not to be reckoned among the causes of the Revolution ; for it is not with a little money and with secret man\u0153uvres that you can convulse a nation of twenty-five millions of souls.\" But it requires neither the gold of the Duke of Or leans nor the inflammatory speeches in the Palais Royal to incite the masses now. The gaunt form of hunger knocks at every door, and the starving people cry: \" Blood or bread ! \" \" Smite still faster, 0 ye black aproned smiths, smite; with strong arm and willing heart ! \" But fifty thousand pikes go a short way in arming this surging mass of ready volunteers. Even women and children will take part in this coming affray ; for the news is abroad that foreign troops are to be sent down upon the slumbering city that very night ; and women and children can, at least, hurl stones and pour boiling water upon the enemy from the roofs of the houses as they pass through the narrow streets. But the night of the 13th passes, and the rumor of invading armies grows fainter ; but no fainter grow the cries of the starving people. On the 13th of July, Paris thought only of defending itself; on the 14th, it became the attacking party. Despotism should be put down. The"], [199, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 157 Bastile was the symbol of despotism ; the Bastile should be stormed. \" The illustrious Quesnay, physician to Louis XV. and to Madame de Pompadour, who lived in the house of the latter, at Versailles, saw the king one day rush in sud denly, and felt alarmed. Madame de Hausset, the witty femme de chambre, who has left such curious memoirs, inquired of him why he seemed so uneasy. ' Madame,' replied he, ' whenever I see the King, I say to myself : There is a man who can cut my head off.' 'Oh,' said she, ' the King is too good I ' \" The lady's maid thus summed up, in one word, the guarantees of the monarchy. The king was too good to cut a man's head off; that was no longer agreeable to custom. But he could, with one word, send him to the Bastile, and there forget him. It remains to be decided which is best, \u2014 to perish with one blow, or to suffer a lingering death for thirty or forty years.\" There were some twenty Bastiles in France. In Paris, in '79, there were about thirty prisons where prisoners could be incarcerated without any sentence. These state-prisons were controlled by the Jesuits. They were in their hands instruments of torture for the Protestants and the Jansenists. The Jesuits were the confessors of the Bastile, and the prisoners who died were buried under false names. The utmost secrecy shrouded every thing. The greatest iniquity and cruelty was carried on in these prisons by the jailers and the Jesuits. The lieutenant of the police went occasionally to inspect the Bastile, but he was kept in ignorance of all the wicked ness there transacted. His reports only reached the ministers. Blank lettre s-de-cachet were given by the min isters to intendants, bishops, and others in the admin istration. These letters were the object of a profitable"], [200, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 158 traffic. They were sold to fathers who wanted to get rid of their sons, and to pretty women who desired to be free from hated husbands. The king was too good to refuse a lettre-de-cachet to a great lord. That lord had an enemy. Did he kill him ? No ; he buried him alive. Oh ! could the walls of the Bas tile speak, what blood-curdling horrors would be told ! A few accounts have reached the world, and these are even too terrible to relate. Fortress of despotism ! sink of iniquity ! charnel-house of living creatures dying by inches ! There, gnawed by rats, starved by jailers, per secuted by the Jesuits, forgotten by the world, \u2014 thou sands perished, after suffering indescribable and almost inconceivable tortures. All other prisons had become more merciful, but this Bastile of Paris had increased in cruelty from reign to reign. Steadily the jailers diminished what they laughingly called \"the liberties of the Bastile.\" But at length one prisoner, possessing a body of iron, which survived all their prisons, \u2014 the Bastile, Vincennes, Charenton, and lastly, the horrors of Bicetre, \u2014 would not be subdued by tortures and killed by starvation, suc ceeded at last in making his misery known. Twice had he been imprisoned by Madame de Pompadour, when, after escaping from his dungeon, he endeavored to gain access to the king, to seek his aid. He was seized even in the ante-chamber of the king, and ministers, magis trates, and great lords pretended to mourn over his ad ventures, but not one stirred a finger or uttered a word in his behalf. \" Malesherbes wept, and so did Gour gues, and Lamoignon, and even Rohan, \u2014 they all wept bitterly,\", so say the gossips ; but their crocodile tears were of no avail. The death of Louis XV. leaves this prisoner still in his dungeon at Bicfitre."], [201, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 159 He wrote one more memorial to some philanthro pist ; this he entrusted to a drunken turnkey, who lost the momentous letter, which was picked up by a woman. She was a poor sewing-woman, this Madame Legros, name illustrious now in the annals of history. Her hus band was an ill-paid teacher of Latin. She read the letter of the tortured prisoner, and it was burnt into her very soul. For three long years she persisted in her efforts to gain the help of those in power to give release to this suffering man. The police were furious. They threatened her with imprisonment. The lieutenant of police sent for her, but it was she that made him trem ble, by her firm defiance. Louis XVI. had suppressed many evils in other pris ons, but the Bastile was, in his eyes, an old servant which must be carefully treated by royalty. When the queen and the Count d'Artois, wishing to have \" Figaro \" played, read it to the king, that he might permit its public representation, his only remark of displeasure was, \" Then must the Bastile be suppressed ? \" When the Bastile was demolished in '89, he exclaimed, with more fervent sorrow than he had expressed on any pre vious occasion, \" Oh, this is awful ! \" To uncover the secrets of the Bastile seemed to Louis XVI. almost sacrilege. So, when at last, Madame Le gros obtained the attention of Louis XVI. through Car dinal de Rohan, who presented to him the request of Madame Legros in behalf of the prisoner Latude, he decided that he was a dangerous man whom he could never restore to liberty. But even this did not cause Madame Legros to give up her efforts. Latude was obstinately bent on living, and Madame Legros was as obstinately determined to gain his deliverance. She enlisted the interest of the young Duke of Orleans and"], [202, "160 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the Marquis de Condorcet and others. The public mur murs grew louder and louder, and Louis himself was obliged to listen, and later grant the release of Latude. Thus a woman's persistence first opened the dungeons of the Bastile, and ere long women will gain the 5th of October, and in February, 1789, the women and girls of Angers wrote : \" Having read the decrees of the male portion of our community, we declare that we will join the nation, reserving to ourselves the care of the baggage and provisions, and such consolations and services as may depend on us ; we will perish rather than abandon our husbands, lovers, sons, and brothers.\" Though women became furious in the French Revolution, they also became more often angels of mercy, and from Marie Antoinette to Charlotte Corday, in the prisons and on the scaffold, women evinced a sublimity of undaunted courage which man could only equal, never surpass. But did those empty-handed men really suppose they could attack, nay more, demolish, that hitherto impreg nable fortress ? It was surely preposterous ; the most impossible chimera of a madman's brain. \" Go ! and thus shalt take the Bastile ! \" impossible as it seemed, thousands believed, and not only believed, but put that belief into action. Michelet says : \" The attack on the Bastile was by no means reasonable. It was an act of faith. Nobody proposed, but all believed, and all acted. Along the streets, the quays, the bridges, and the boule vards, the crowd shouted to the crowd : ' To the Bastile ! The Bastile ! ' And the tolling of the tocsin thundered in every ear, ' d la Bastille ! ' Nobody gave the impulse. The orators of the Palais Royal passed the time in draw ing up a list of proscription, in condemning the queen to death, as well as Madame de Polignac, Artois, Flesselles the provost, and others. The names of the conquerors"], [203, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 161 of the Bastile do not include one of these makers of motions. The Palais Royal was not the starting-point, neither was it to the Palais Royal that the conquerors brought back the spoils and prisoners. \" Still less had the electors, assembled in the Hdtel de Ville, the idea of the attack. On the contrary, in order to prevent it, as well as the carnage which the Bastile could so easily make, they went so far as to promise the governor, that if he withdrew his cannon he should not be attacked. The electors did not behave treacherously, though they were accused of having done so, but they had no faith. Who had ? They who had also the devo tion and the strength to accomplish their faith. Who ? Why, the people, \u2014 everybody. That 14th of July alone, among the achievements of the Republic, was the day of the whole people.\" 1 But no one of all the historians of the French Revolu tion has so graphically described this momentous event as Carlyle. All other narratives pale before his into almost insignificance. With such a picture as his before us it were useless to attempt to try one's own powers. Therefore we will let Carlyle speak for us. \" At Paris, agitated Besenval, before retiring for the night, has stept over to old M. de Sombreuil, of the H6tel des Invalides, hard by. M. de Sombreuil has, what is a great secret, some eight-and-twenty thousand stand of muskets deposited in his cellars there ; but no trust in the temper of his Invalides. This day, for example, he sent twenty of the fellows down to unscrew those muskets, lest sedition might snatch at them. But scarcely in six hours had the twenty unscrewed twenty gun-locks, or dogsheads (chiens) of locks, each Invalide 1 Michelet."], [204, "162 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. his dogshead ! If ordered to fire, they would, he imag ines, turn their cannon against himself. \" Unfortunate old military gentleman, it is your hour, not of glory ! Old Marquis de Launay too, of the Bas tile, has pulled up his drawbridges long since, 'and retired into his interior ; ' with sentries walking on the battlements, under the midnight sky, aloft over the glare of the illuminated Paris, whom a National Patrol, passing that way, takes the liberty of firing at ; ' seven shots towards twelve at night,' which do not take effect. This was the 13th day of July, 1789 ; a worse day, many said, than the last 13th was, when only hail fell out of Heaven, not madness rose out of Tophet, ruining worse than crops ! \"Behold, about nine in the morning, our National Volunteers rolling in long, wide flood, south-westward to the H6tel des Invalides, in search of the one thing need ful.

And so with such protracted crash of deafening, most discordant orchestra-music, the scene is changed, and eight-and twenty thousand sufficient firelocks are on the shoulders of as many National Guards, lifted thereby out of dark ness into fiery light. \"All morning, since nine, there has been a cry every where, ' To the Bastile !

They think they will not fire, if not fired on, \u2014 if they can help it ; but must, on the whole, be ruled considerably by circumstances. . . . \" To describe this Siege of the Bastile (thought to be one of the most important in history) perhaps transcends the talent of mortals.

Deputations, three in number, arrive from the H6tel de Ville, \u2014 Abbd Fauchet (who was one) can say, with what almost superhuman courage of benev olence. These wave their Town-flag in the arched Gate way, and stand rolling their drum; but to no purpose. In such a Crack of Doom, De Launay cannot hear them,"], [210, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 166 dare not believe them. They return, with justified rage, the whew of lead still singing in their ears. . . . \"On, then, all Frenchmen, that have hearts in your bodies ! Roar with all your throats, of cartilage and metal, ye Sons of Liberty ; stir spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in you, soul, body, or spirit ; for it is the hour ! Smite, thou Louis Tournay, cartwright of the Marais, old-soldier of the Regiment Dauphine ; smite at that outer drawbridge chain, though the fiery hail whistles round thee ! Never, over nave or felloe, did thy axe strike such a stroke. Down with it, man! down with it to Orcus ! Let the whole accursed Edifice sink thither, and Tyranny be swallowed up forever ! The Firemen are here, squirting with their fire-pumps on the Invalides' cannon, to wet the torchholes. They unfortunately can not squirt so high, but produce only clouds of spray. Individuals of classical knowledge propose catapults. Santerre, the sonorous Brewer of the Suburb Saint- Antoine, advises rather that the place be fired, by a ' mixture of phosphorus and oil-of-turpentine spouted up through forcing-pumps.' Oh, Spinola-Santerre, hast thou the mixture ready? Every man his own engineer! And still the fire-deluge abates not ; even women are firing, and Turks ; at least one woman and one Turk. Gardes Francaises have come ; real cannon, real cannoneers. How the great Bastile Clock ticks (inaudible) in its Inner Court there, at its ease, hour after hour, as if noth ing special for it or the world were passing ! It tolled One when the firing began, and is now pointing towards Five, and still the firing slacks not.

One poor troop of Hussars has crept, reconnoitring cautiously along the Quais, as far as the Pont Neuf. 'We are come to join you,' said the Captain, ' for the crowd seems shoreless.' A large-headed, dwarfish individual, of smoke-bleared aspect, shambles forwards, opening his blue lips, for there is sense in him, and croaks, 'Alight, then, and give up your arms ! ' The Hussar-Captain is too happy to be escorted to the Barriers, and dismissed on parole. Who the squat individual was ? Men answer, it is M. Marat, author of the excellent pacific, 'Avis au Peuple!' Great, truly, oh, thou remarkable Dogleech, is this thy day of emergence and new-birth ; and yet this same day come four years, \u2014 but let the curtains of the future hang. \" What shall De Launay do ? One thing only De Launay could have done; what he said he would do. Fancy him sitting, from the first, with lighted taper, within arm's length of the Powder-Magazine ; motionless, like old Roman Senator, or bronze lamp-holder; coldly apprizing Thuriot, and all men, by a slight motion of his eye, what his resolution was ; harmless he sat there, while unharmed ; but the King's Fortress, meanwhile, could, might, would or should in nowise be surrendered, save to the King's Messenger. One old man's life is worthless, so it be lost with honor ; but think, ye brawl ing canaille, how will it be when a whole Bastile springs skyward ! In such statuesque, taper-holding attitude, one fancies De Launay might have left Thuriot, the red Clerks of the Basoche, Cur6 of Saint-Stephen and all the tag-rag-and-bob-tail of the world, to work their will. \" And yet, withal, he could not do it. . . . Distracted, he hovers between two ; hopes in the middle of despair ; surrenders not his fortress ; declares he will blow it up,"], [212, "168 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. seizes torch to blow it up, and does not blow it. Un happy old De Launay, it is the death-agony of thy Bastile and thee ! Jail, jailering, and jailer, all three, such as they may have been, must finish. \"For four hours now has the World-Bedlam roared; call it the World-Chimera, blowing fire ! The poor In valides have sunk under their battlements, or rise only with reversed muskets. They have made a white flag of napkins ; go beating the chamade, or seeming to beat, for one can hear nothing. The very Swiss at the port cullis look weary of firing ; disheartened in the fire deluge ; a porthole at the drawbridge is opened, as by one that would speak. See Huissier Maillard, the shifty man ! On his plank, swinging over the abyss of that stone ditch ; plank perilous ; such a Dove towards such an Ark ! Deftly, thou shifty Usher ; one man already fell, and lies smashed, far down there, against the ma sonry ! Usher Maillard falls not. Deftly, unerring he walks, with outspread palm.

Where is De Launay ? He shall not escape. Some tried to save him, but his head soon waved upon a pike. Outward again they surged through the streets. False Fesselles was met and shot, and his head soon kept company with that of De Launay upon a pike. Seven heads were shortly on pikes. Sad to relate, the brave Invalide who had snatched the burning torch from the hand of De Launay, when he would have lighted the Bastile Magazine, and blown a hundred thousand lives into eternity, was hung by mistake, by the enfuriated mob. The Bastile is taken. The crowd wave the huge key aloft in triumph. The conquerors will soon demolish that ancient symbol of despotism. The people have arisen. Victory crowns their banners. Faith has manifested itself in action, \u2014 action has culminated in victory. But while the people in Paris were fighting for freedom from past oppressions, what were they doing at Versailles, this 14th of July ? The Court was preparing to attack Paris. Berthier, the intendant, was at the military school, giving orders ; and Foulon, his father-in-law, the under minister of war, was at Versailles, completing arrange ments. Paris was to have been attacked at night, at seven points simultaneously. Marie Antoinette, and Madame de Polignac are reported to have gone into the Orangerie, there to meet the officers of the king's troops, and give them wine and encouragement to fight valiantly for the court. Wine is also freely meted out to the soldiers. But amidst all this bustle of hilarious prepa ration, a body of cavalry are seen approaching rapidly through a cloud of dust. Who rides so fast and furi ously ? It is Prince de Lambesc with his officers, flying before the people of Paris. \" The Bastile is taken ! \" rings"], [214, "170 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. out on the air. Another messenger arrives breathless. The Governor is killed ! All Paris is in arms ! is the ominous news. All the courtiers look aghast. The peo ple are in arms, and will perchance attack Versailles ! Why, how is this ? Was not every arrangement made to attack and subdue this rebellious people ? What shall be done ? The Assembly sitting at Versailles become furious when the news is told them. \" Heads ! \" cries Mirabeau. \" We must have De Broglie's head ! \" A deputation immediately waits upon the king to demand the with drawal of his foreign troops. The king answers equivo cally. The clamorous Assembly send a second deputa tion. \"The king is reported heart-broken, but he can do no more.\" Amidst contradictory reports the king gave no orders, and as usual retired early to rest. Poor king ! What could he do ? He knew not. Well, then, why not sleep ? Ah, Louis, it required a man to act, not to sleep. While you slumber a Revolution is being inaugurated in Paris, with such wild yells of triumph as shall soon awaken even your dull ears ; and those awful thunder-tones of an uprising nation shall ere long sound the knell of your dreadful doom ! The Duke of Orleans went on the 15th of July to the council at the palace. But he was obliged to wait at the door. Whereupon, he writes to assure the king, \" as a good and loyal subject, that if matters grew worse, he would go over to England.\" This same Due d' Orleans had before spent many months in England, when he was not yet Duke of Orleans, but Due de Chartres ; and as he flitted to and fro across the Strait, he imported many English fashions ; \" carriages and saddles ; top-boots, and redingotes, as we call riding-coats. Nay, the very mode of riding ; for now no man on a level with his age,"], [215, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 171 but will trot d, I'Anglaise, rising in the stirrups ; scornful of the old sitfast method, in which, according to Shake speare, ' butter and eggs ' go to market.\" But the Due d'Orleans has something else now to think of, except English fashions. He has tried fraternizing with the Paris mob, by means of his fair Pamela, his latest fancy, who, on black horse, with lackey in red livery, rode bravely into the middle of the Paris riot on the 14th, to test the popularity of the duke. But even Pamela did not avail ; and now the duke grows fearful. Flitting to England, or elsewhere, will not long suffice to save his head. Ere long, we shall again behold him; this time on the scaffold. But whilst the duke was kept waiting at the council door, a third deputation is departing from the Assembly, bearing these words of Mirabeau to the king : \" Go and tell the king that the foreign hordes by which we are invested were visited yesterday by the princes and princesses, by the courtiers, who lavished on them their caresses, presents, and exhortations. Tell him that all night long those foreign satellites, gorged with wine and gold, have predicted, in their impious songs, the servitude of France, and that their brutal vows have invoked the destruction of the National Assembly. Tell him that in his very palace his courtiers danced to the sounds of that barbarous music, and that such was the prelude to the massacre of Saint Bartholomew. Tell him that King Henry, whose memory is adored by the universe, that ancestor of his, whom he affected to wish to take as his model, ordered provisions to be sent into revolted Paris, which he was besieging in person ; whilst his ferocious counsellors have driven back the corn which commerce was bringing to his starving but faithful Paris.\" But ere the departure of this deputation, Louis"], [216, "172 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. himself arrives at the Assembly, accompanied only by his brother. He announces that he has given orders to the troops to remove from Paris and Versailles, and bids the Assembly so inform the people. With enthusi asm the credulous Assembly gathers round him. In the hot July sun, as the king crosses the Place d'Armes, on his way back to the palace, the people so press upon him that he nearly faints, owing to his vast corpulency and the heat. But there remains yet some doubt of the good will of this vacillating king, whom the people are now so rapturously applauding. A woman unconsciously becomes the mouthpiece for that crowd of people. Fall ing at his knees as he passes, she exclaims, \" Oh, Sire, are you really sincere ? Will they not make you change ? \" Ominous question. Could poor Louis ever be expected to remain of one mind beyond the passing hour ? Just as the gates of the palace closed upon him, the Swiss band struck up the air, \" Ou peut on etre mieux qu'au sein de sa famille ?\" But the family, the people, have been shut out ; observing which, the king ordered the gates to be again opened. The queen appeared on the balcony with her children ; and Versailles was once again in accord with its king. But in Paris, how fares it ? There they are burying their dead. Victory has cost many lives. Beside a dead man is placed a hat, and an appeal is made to passers by. \" Sir, something for this poor fellow who was killed for the nation ! Madame, it is for the family of this poor man, killed for the nation.\" Thus was money raised to bury the dead, and to feed the helpless living ones. At two o'clock, a man arrives in Paris, breathless and fainting. He has run all the way from Sevres. \" The Revolution is finished ! \" he cries. \" The king has been"], [217, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 173 in the Assembly, and has said to the deputies, ' I trust myself to you ! ' A hundred deputies are on their way from Versailles to bring the king's message to Paris.\" The hundred deputies, preceded by the French Guards, the Swiss, and officers of the city militia, escorted by deputies of the electors, are soon seen marching up the Rue Saint Honore, to the sound of martial music. The streets are lined with the welcoming people ; and flowers and benedictions are showered upon their heads from neighboring windows. \" The National Assembly and the people of Paris, the Oath of the Jeu-de-Paume (Tennis-Court), and the taking of the Bastile, \u2014 victory and victory kissed each other.\" Deputies kiss and weep over the flags of the French Guards. \" Flags of Liberty ! \" they cry. Paris is wild with joy. Hope beams in every eye. The Revolution is completed, they think. On passes the joyous proces- sion to the H6tel de Ville. Speeches are made. La Fayette addresses the crowd with coolness and prudence. He is followed by the impetuous Lally Tollendal. Thirty years before, Lally's father had been beheaded at the same Place de Greve, by the ancien regime; and his son's speech, with Irish enthusiasm, was a sort of amnesty for that same royal regime. But though Paris was still sur- rounded by troops, placed there by the king's orders, which had not yet been removed, the Assembly was filled with zealous emotion. The good Louis had prom- ised to have them removed ; and fat Lally was crowned with flowers, and carried to the window and shown to the crowd. Resisting, he took the wreath from his own head, and forced it upon that of Bailly, the first presi dent of the National Assembly, and who had led the deputation from Versailles. Bailly modestly refused. But the Archbishop of Paris fastened the flowers upon"], [218, "174 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Bailly's head. Small incident, think you ? Yes, in itself, but nevertheless significant ; for the prelate who crowned the president of the Oath of the Tennis-Court, was the one who advised the coup d'itat of the court, and forced Paris to conquer. This same archbishop now proposes a Te Deum, and all follow him to N6tre Dame. \" It was rather a De Prosundis that he first owed to those whose deaths he had occasioned.\" Another incident must be noticed. Among the speeches made at the H6tel de Ville, M. de Liancourt, a good natured friend of the king, suavely declared that the king willingly pardoned the French Guards, for their part in the taking of the Bastile. Whereupon, one of them exclaimed, \" We need no pardon. In serving the nation, we serve the king ; the intentions which he dis plays to-day prove sufficiently to France that we alone have been faithful to the king and the country.\" Bailly was proclaimed mayor of Paris, and La Fayette was elected Commander-in-Chief of the Citizen Militia, henceforth known as the National Guards. Significant of the times. A mayor and commandant appointed by the electors without the king's consent, or even cogni zance. The red, white, and blue cockade was now sub stituted for the green, and La Fayette prophetically declared \" that it would make the tour of the world.\" On the 17th of July the king left Versailles to go to Paris. Much anxiety was felt concerning the result of this visit. The queen bade him farewell with streaming eyes, fearing lest death should await him. The king apparently was suspicious of assassination. Previous to his departure he heard mass, took the communion, and nominated Monsieur, Lieutenant-General, in case he was killed or detained a prisoner. Marie Antoinette spent that anxious day in writing and committing to"], [219, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 175 memory the speech she intended to pronounce at the Assembly, should it transpire that Louis should not return. The king was attended by three or four hun dred deputies, and arriving in Paris was met by Mayor Bailly, who presented to him the keys of the city, say ing : \" Sire, I bring you the keys of Paris ; they are the same which were presented to Henry IV. He had re conquered his people ; now the people have reconquered their king.\" Momentous words ! the full significance of which was scarcely perceived at that time even by Bailly. In front of the king's carriage rode La Fayette in pri vate dress, sword in hand, and national cockade and plume upon his hat. It was the commandant who swayed the crowd. Obedience hung upon his slightest gesture. Silence was ominous. Not one cry of \"Vive le Roi ! \" Some single cries of \" Vive la Nation ! \" but for the most part silence. Two hundred thousand men armed with guns, pikes, lances, sabres, swords, pitchforks, and scythes. Even women stood armed beside their husbands, and girls by their fathers. Two men only were applauded \u2014 Bailly and La Fayette. Truly a gloomy procession of king and deputies amidst that strangely armed crowd. As the king alights, Bailly offers him the new cockade. The king puts it in his hat, and ascends the steps of the Hdtel de Ville under a canopy of crossed swords. Strange honor! Bodeful of the yoke rather than the crown. As the king enters the great hall, he is re ceived with great though silent emotion ; those in front kneeling, so that those behind them might see the king. All hands are raised to the throne ; all eyes are wet with tears. Only stolid Louis looks unmoved. Could not that kneeling Assembly rouse him from his forbidding lethargy ?"], [220, "176 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The president of the electors, Moreau de Saint Mery \u2014 he who had given three thousand orders in thirty hours, during the memorable 13th and 14th of July \u2014 addressed the king thus: \"You come to promise your subjects that the authors of those disastrous councils shall surround you no longer, and Virtue, too long exiled, shall remain your support.\" By Virtue, it was known that he meant Necker. To this Louis responded nothing. It was then proposed to raise a statue to the king on the Place de la Bastille, and was unanimously voted. \"A statue for a defeat ! \" Surely this was new and original. Still Louis said nothing. Next Lally endeavors to speak for him, and talks of the king's \" chagrin, and the need he had of consolation.\" Bailly then shows the king to the people at the window of the H6tel de Ville, with the national cockade in his hat. Still Louis is silent. At last he speaks, and the electors catch the laconic sentence, \" You may always rely on my affection.\" Again the king appears on the street. The crowd applaud him. \" Vive le Roi ! \" is heard as he enters his carriage. Will he not give the expectant people one word ? The least kind word would have been received with rapturous delight. But Louis is silent. A market woman flings her arms about his neck ; men stop his carriage, and pour out wine for his coachmen and valets, and drink with them to the health of the king. But still the silent king speaks not. The opportunity for regaining his ascendancy over the people is lost. Scarcely could the enthusiasm of the Federation retrieve this sad mistake. At nine in the evening Louis returns to Versailles, and is met with tears of joy by the queen and his children. He is yet alive! Pitiable state between sovereign and people ! And now the Count d'Artois, the"], [221, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 177 Condes, the Polignacs, Broglie, Lambesc, and others flee from France. The king is even insulted by an insolent footman in his own apartments. So low has royalty fallen ! The privileged class either emigrate or submit, and henceforth the National Assembly will in truth rule. The king, though nominal ruler, has become a nonentity. Poor Louis XVI., secluding thyself in a corner of thy lonely palace ; thou shalt learn yet more painful lessons ! But though the hated Berthier and Foulon have been in hiding, the people have not forgotten them. Famine is increasing in Paris ; and Foulon had once declared, \" Let the people eat grass ! \" Now his .turn shall come. Betrayed by his own servants, he is seized by the mob. \" You wanted to give us hay,\" they say ; \" you shall eat some yourself.\" They put a truss of hay on his back ; crown him with nettles ; and fasten a collar of thistles around his neck. Thus they lead him in front of the Hdtel de Ville. Bailly descends, and the crowd demand from him Foulon's immediate death. \" Hang him ! Hang him ! \" they shout. Bailly expostulates to no pur pose. \" Judge him instantly, and then hang him ! \" cries the mob. \" Make room for M. de La Fayette ! \" one exclaims. La Fayette arrives; speaks. Foulon is no doubt guilty, he admits, but law and order must be pre served. \" Let him be conducted to the Abbaye ! There he shall be judged ! \" \" Does it require time to judge a man who has been judged these thirty years ? \" cries a voice ; and once more the shout arises, \" Hang him ! \" The lanterne (lamp) of La Place de Greve is near by ; a convenient hanging-post. They hoist him ; twice the rope breaks, Foulon pleading pitiably for life; but at last he is hanged ; and his head is borne aloft upon a pike, with its crown of nettles, and a wisp of grass stuffed into the ghastly mouth. This Lanterne"], [222, "178 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. of La Greve will speedily make for itself a noted place in history ; so much so, \" that strangers gaze upon it in an ecstasy of astonishment ; they wonder that a lamp should have done more in two days than all their heroes in a hundred years.\" But the intendant Berthier shall not escape. \" He has robbed the king and France. He has devoured the sub stance of the people. He has been the slave of the rich, and the tyrant of the poor. He has drunk the blood of the widow and the orphan. He has cheated the king. He has betrayed his country.\" Such was the verdict of the people. Little availed it that he fled. He was arrested at Compiegne, and conducted to Paris, escorted by a clamoring mob as bodyguard. On the way thither a procession meets him, bearing the head of Foulon on a pike. He is forced to look upon this ghastly relic of his father-in-law. Onward march his jailers to the Hdtel de Ville. Not even do they stop to parley with the electors. Even the lamp-post is too slow a process of death. Ber thier was stabbed with a hundred bayonets, he vainly de fending himself ; and one man tore out his bleeding heart, and held it up to the view of the furious populace. Ah, the down-trodden people are rapidly arising and demand ing vengeance. Woe to those who have heretofore abused them ! But in one way these deeds of vengeance reacted with injury upon France. The acts of violence in Paris and those in the provinces placed the National Assembly in a difficult position. If they denounced and punished the actors, they would be supposed to be allies of the court ; if they allowed such deeds to be repeated, they would seem to encourage anarchy. England, in spite of her hate, at first smiled upon the French Revolution. She applauded France ; and \" now she rubs her hands in glee"], [223, "STORMING THE BASTILE. 179 and is grateful to the Lanterne. ' The Bastile, though demolished, will never disappear ; ' she cries ; ' behold an other Bastile \u2014 arbitrary rule \u2014 is springing up.' \" Mich elet says : \" Tell us, what wrould you have done, you offi cious counsellors, you friendly enemies, sages of Euro pean aristocracy, you who so carefully pour calumny on the hatred you have planted ? Sitting at your ease on the dead bodies of Ireland, Italy, and Poland, deign to answer ; have not your revolutions of interest cost more blood than our revolutions of ideas ? \" But regardless of England's applause or criticisms, France is working out her own destiny. The progress of that Revolution is miraculous. France is armed in a week, and finds herself possessed of the most numerous army ever seen since the crusades. One day they say, We have two hundred thousand men ; the next, it is five hundred thousand ; and in a week a million of men have armed ; then two, three millions. And all this great armed multitude ask the Assembly what they are to do. Did France exist before that time ? It might be denied. \" She became at once a sword and principle.\" And so the people, having once taken up arms, use them every where. In the provinces they attack and capture the lordly castles, their own Bastiles of despotism. The ancient towers are levelled to the earth ; and while the Assembly proclaim the rights of man, abolish feudal rights, upon the memorable 4th of August, suppress tithes, proclaim religious liberty, and busy themselves with the making of the constitution, the people, now here, now there, assert and maintain not only their rights, but their increasing sovereignty. \" King Louis has his new ministry ; mere popularities ; old President Pompignan; Necker coming back in tri umph ; and other such. But what will it avail him ?"], [224, "180 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The sceptre, all but the wooden gilt sceptre, has departed else-w hither.\" ' But the people are still starving. While Berthier was being borne along by the mob, some threw black bread at him, crying, \" Take, that brigand ; that is the bread you made us eat ! \" And Berthiers and Fou lons and courtiers trafficked in the profits of scarcity. Famine became a science, no longer the result of the seasons, but caused by a deed of the civil order; brought about by a complicated art of administration and com merce. Contracters, bankers, financiers, revenue-farmers, intendants, counsellors, and ministers, formed with specu lators and politicians the infamous Famine Compact. Longer and longer grow the lines before the bakers' shops, and scarcer and scarcer the bread. Louder and louder grow the inflammatory speeches at the Palais Royal. More and more plenty the shower of pamphlets flying through the city streets ; but pamphlets, however read able, will not serve for bread, even though a brilliant Camille Desmoulins makes them scintillate with sparks of genius. \" For, if, in that murk of Journalism, with its dull blustering, with its fixed or loose fury, any ray of genius greet thee, be sure it is Camille's. The thing that Camille touches, he with his light finger adorns ; bright ness plays, gentle, unexpected, amid horrible confusions ; often is the word of Camille worth reading, when no other's is.

ON the first of October a military banquet was given by the King's Body-Guard to the regiments of Flanders, and the Swiss, in the magnificent theatre at Versailles. Invitations were sent to only a few of the officers of the National Guard, such as were loyal to the king. In the splendid hall of the opera, lined with mirrors, and glittering with its thousand lights, the gorgeous feast is spread. Wine flows freely. Toasts are drunk to the king and queen and dauphin. Some one faintly proposes \" The Nation ! \" but meets with no response. The doors open. Behold the king and the queen ! Marie Antoinette enters there, \" issuing from her state-rooms like the moon from the clouds, this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts ; royal husband by her side, young dauphin in her arms.\" Madame Le Brun, the celebrated portrait-painter, thus describes the queen : \u2014 \" Marie Antoinette was tall, exquisitely well propor tioned, sufficiently plump, without being too much so. Her arms were superb, her hands small, perfect in form, and her feet charming. Her gait was more graceful than that of any woman in France ; she held her head very erect, with a majesty which enabled you to distinguish the sovereign amidst all her court, and yet that majesty did not in the least detract from the extreme kindness and benevolence of her look. In short, it is extremely difficult to convey to any one who has not seen the Queen, any idea of all the graces and all the dignity that were combined in her. Her features were not regu lar ; she derived from her family that long, narrow oval, peculiar to the Austrian nation. Her eyes were not large ; their color was nearly blue, and they had an in tellectual and mild expression; her nose was thin and handsome ; her mouth not too large, though the lips were rather thick. But the most remarkable thing about"], [227, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 183 her face was the brilliancy of her complexion. I never saw any one so brilliant \u2014 yes, brilliant is the word; for her skin was so transparent that it took no shade. Hence I never could render its effect so as to please my self ; I lacked colors to represent that freshness, those delicate tones, which belonged exclusively to that fasci nating face, and which I never observed in any other woman. As for her conversation, it would be difficult for me to describe all its grace, all its benevolence. I do not think that the Queen Marie Antoinette ever missed an occasion to say an agreeable thing to those who had the honor to approach her.\" And there she stands, that beautifully majestic queen! Down through the annals of history have come the eulo giums of her many charms, loveliest of women, fated by a cruel destiny, with no fault of her own beyond a pardon able imprudence, to be worshipped as an angel and cursed as a fiend. Burke said of Marie Antoinette, \" that surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision.\" He saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she had just begun to move in, \" glittering like the morning star, full of life, and splendor, and joy.\" Horace Walpole thus describes her appearance at a state court ball : \u2014 \"It was impossible to see anything but the queen. Hebes and Floras and Graces are street-walkers to her. She is a statue of beauty when standing or sitting ; grace itself when she moves. She was dressed in silver scattered over with laurier roses ; few diamonds ; and feathers much lower than the monument. The ball lasted just two hours. The monarch did not dance, but for the first two rounds of the minuet even the queen"], [228, "184 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. does not turn her back to him. Yet her behavior is as easy as divine.\" Lamartine thus pictures her \" The queen seemed to be created by nature to contrast with the king, and to attract forever the interest and pity of ages, to one of those state dramas, which are in complete unless the miseries and misfortunes of a woman mingle in them. Daughter of Maria Theresa, she had commenced her life in the storms of the Austrian mon archy. Like Maria Theresa, she had the heart of a king. On her arrival in France her beauty had dazzled the whole kingdom, \u2014 a beauty then in all its splendor. She was tall, slim, and graceful, \u2014 a real daughter of the Tyrol. Her naturally majestic carriage in no way im paired the grace of her movements ; her neck rising ele gantly and distinctly from her shoulders, gave expression to every attitude. \" The woman was perceptible beneath the queen, the tenderness of heart was not lost in the elevation of her destiny. Her light brown hair was long and silky ; her forehead, high and rather projecting, was united to her temples by those fine curves which give so much deli cacy and expression to that seat of thought, or soul, in women; her eyes of that clear blue which recall the skies of the North or the waters of the Danube ; an aquiline nose, with nostrils open and slightly projecting, where emotions palpitate, and courage is evidenced; a large mouth, brilliant teeth, Austrian lips, that is, pro jecting and well defined ; an oval countenance, animated, varying, impassioned, and the ensemble of these features replete with that expression impossible to describe, which emanates from the look, the shades, the reflections of the face, which encompasses it with an iris, like that of the warm and tinted vapor which bathes objects in full sun-"], [229, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 185 light \u2014 the extreme loveliness which the ideal conveys, and which by giving it life increases its attraction. With all these charms, a soul yearning to attach itself, a heart easily moved, but yet earnest in desire to fix itself; a pensive and intelligent smile, with nothing of vacuity in it, nothing of preference or mere acquaintanceship in it, because it felt itself worthy of friendships. Such was Marie Antoinette as a woman. \" It was enough to form the happiness of a man, and the ornament of a court ; but to inspire a wavering mon arch, and be the safeguard of a state under trying cir cumstances, something more is requisite. The genius of government is required, and the queen had it not. Noth ing could have prepared her for the regulation of the disordered elements which were about her ; misfortune had given her no time for reflection. Hailed with enthu siasm by a perverse court and an ardent nation, she must have believed in the eternity of such sentiments. She was lulled to sleep in the pleasures of the Trianon. She had heard the first threatenings of the tempest without believing in its dangers ; she had trusted in the love she inspired, and which she felt in her own heart. The court had become exacting, the nation hostile. The instrument of the intrigues of the court on the heart of the king, she had at first favored, and then opposed, all reforms which prevented or delayed the crisis that arose. Her policy was but infatuation ; her system but the per petual abandonment of herself to every partisan who promised her the king's safety. The Comte d'Artois, the king's youngest brother, chivalrous in etiquette, had much influence with her. He relied greatly on the no blesse; made frequent references to his sword. He laughed at the crisis ; he disdained this war of words, caballed against ministers, and treated passing events"], [230, "186 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with levity. The queen, intoxicated with the adulation of those around her, urged the king to recall the next day what he had conceded on the previous evening. Her hand was felt in all the transactions of the govern ment : her apartments were the focus of a perpetual con spiracy against the government ; the nation detected it, and ultimately detested her. \" Her name became for the people the phantom of all counter-revolution. We are apt to calumniate what we fear. She was depicted under the features of a Messa lina. The most infamous pamphlets were in circulation ; the most scandalous anecdotes were credited. She may be accused of tenderness, but never of depravity. Lovely, young, and adored, if her heart did not remain insen sible, her innermost feelings never gave just ground for scandal. \"On the days of the 5th and 6th of October the queen perceived (too late) the enmity of the people ; her heart must have been full of indignation. Emigra tion commenced, and she viewed it favorably. All her friends were at Coblentz ; she was believed to be in close connection with them, and this belief was true. Stories of an Austrian committee were busily spread amongst the people. The queen was accused of conspiring for the destruction of the nation, who at every moment demanded her head. A people in revolt must have some one to hate, and now it was the queen. Her name was the theme of their songs of rage. One woman was the enemy of a whole nation, and her pride disdained to undeceive them. She enclosed herself in her resentment and her terror. Imprisoned in the palace of the Tuile ries, she could not put her head out of a window, without provoking an outrage and hearing insult. Every noise in the city made her apprehensive of an insurrection."], [231, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 187 Her days were melancholy, her nights disturbed; she underwent hourly agony for two years, and that anguish was magnified in her heart by her love for her two chil- dren, and her disquietude for the king. Her court was forsaken; she saw none but the shadows of authority, the ministers forced on her, before whom she was com- pelled to mask her countenance in smiles. Her apart- ments were watched by spies in the guise of servants. It was necessary to mislead them, in order to have inter- views with the few friends who remained to her. Private staircases, dark corridors, were the means by which at night her secret counsellors obtained access to her ear. These meetings resembled conspiracies ; she left them every time with a different train of ideas, which she communicated to the king, whose behavior thus acquired the incoherence of a woman persecuted and distressed. Measures of resistance, bribing the Assembly, an entire surrender of the constitution, attempts at force, an as- sumption of royal dignity, repentance, weakness, terror, flight, \u2014 all were discussed, planned, decided on, pre- pared, and abandoned, on the same day. Women, so sublime in their devotion, are seldom capable of the continuous firmness of mind, the imperturbability, requi- site for a political plan. Their politics are in their heart, their passions trench so closely on their reason. Of all the virtues which a throne requires, they have but cour age ; often heroes, they are seldom statesmen. The queen was another example of this : she did the king incredible mischief. With a mind infinitely superior, with more soul, more character, than he, her superiority only served to inspire him with mischievous counsels.\" Fain would we linger and gaze on Marie Antoinette, as she stands there in all her regal beauty, with the young dauphin in her arms, receiving the adulation of"], [232, "188 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the gayly uniformed officers who bow before her in chiv alrous admiration. So soon must we behold this won drous beauty dimmed by sorrow, and that fair face distorted with heart-rending woe. This is almost our last glimpse of her regal splendor; and the flattering homage now paid to her by enthusiastic soldiers dazzled by her radiant beauty, as they drink to her health, and gaze fascinated upon her bewitching face, shall ere long be changed to the wild curses of a menacing mob, who shall cry, \"A bas I'Autrichienne ! \" So beautiful and yet so unfortunate ! As Marie An toinette was leaving the banqueting-hall with King Louis, the band played the affecting air \" O Richard, 0 my king, abandoned by the whole world ! \" Every heart melted at that appeal. Several of the officers in their zeal tore off the tri-colored cockade which they wore, and placed the black Austrian cockade in their hats ; and some say that the tri-colored cockade was trampled under foot. Whether or no, it was a fatal feast. And as usual, in the sad destiny of poor Marie Antoinette, she was blamed for the result ; and the momentous feast of October became the spark to light the flame of indigna tion which resulted in the popular outbursts of the 5th and 6th of that same October month. And while we pity the queen, must we not also pity the people ? Starving Paris is informed that at Versailles these foreign regi ments riot in plenty and intoxicate themselves with royal wines, and pay homage to an Austrian woman, while their women and children lie dying in the streets, and their little ones cry in vain for bread. Yes, it was a terrible mistake, that Versailles banquet ; and the harm was augmented two days after, when another feast was given, and it was rumored that the court ladies were making white cockades with their ribbons and handker-"], [233, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 189 chiefs, and themselves tying them upon the new cheva liers, even allowing their dainty hands to be kissed by these foreign knights, as each vowed to guard well his lady's colors. More, too, is rumored in Paris. It is said that the court intends to carry off the king to Metz ; that there in a fortress, defended by his faithful soldiers and sur rounded by his court, Paris might be commanded, nay, more, forced to obey his demands, or rather, the demands of his court, as the king was but their mouthpiece. Count d'Estaing, who commanded the National Guards at Versailles, loyal to his king, and at the same time endeavoring to be faithful to the nation, heard these rumors with alarm. Imagining that these intrigues were not yet known to the king and queen, and foreseeing the evil resulting from such plans, he wrote the following letter to Marie Antoinette : \" It is necessary \u2014 my duty and my loyalty require it \u2014 that I should lay at the feet of the Queen the account of the visit which I have paid to Paris. I must confess to your Majesty that I did not close my eyes all night, after I was told, in good society, in good company \u2014 and gracious Heaven ! what would be the consequence if this were to be circulated among the people ? \u2014 I was repeatedly told that signatures were being collected among the clergy and the nobilby. Some assert that this is done with the approbation of the king ; others believe that it is without his knowledge. It is affirmed that a plan is formed, that it is by Champagne or Verdun that the king is to retire, or to be carried off ; that he is going to Metz. I have not promised not to divulge this circumstance to any one. It fills me with such terror as I have never yet known. It is not for myself that I feel it. I implore the Queen to calculate, in her wisdom, all that might result from one false step ;"], [234, "190 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the first costs dear enough. I have seen that kind heart of the Queen bestow tears on the fate of immolated victims ; now it would be streams of blood spilt to no purpose, that she would have to regret. A mere indecis ion may be without remedy. It is only by breasting the torrent, not by humoring it, that one can succeed in partly directing it. The Queen can conquer this kingdom for the King. Nature has lavished upon her the means of doing it. She may imitate her august mother ; if not, I am silent.\" But poor Marie Antoinette was allowed no opportunity of imitating her illustrious mother. What could she do in just the circumstances which surrounded her? His tory has failed to answer. Given, her position, her hus band, and her court, unless she had been sole sovereign, as Maria Theresa, can any one solve the problem, how she could have saved France. Bread! Bread! Bread! cry the starving populace in Paris. Bread ! Bread ! is the echoing cry from the prov inces ; and while the people starve, the foreign troops menacing them, perchance with attack, riot in luxury and plenty, trample upon the national cockade, and flaunt their foreign red and green uniforms, and black Austrian cockades, even in their very midst. Then, too, the scanty supplies of flour from Corbeil, which here tofore came daily, arrive now only every other day. Surely the people must do something ! To bring the king to Paris, before the court can carry him off, is the expedient at length suggested. But who shall undertake it? On the 5th of October a multitude of unfortunate creatures who have eaten nothing for thirty hours, are wandering in the Paris streets. The hearts of the women can endure this sight of misery no longer. \" If the men will not help us, we will help our-"], [235, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 191 selves,\" they cry. \" We will bring back the baker and the baker's icife; and we will have the pleasure of hear ing our little daring mother Mirabeau ! \" A young girl seizes a drum from a guard-house, and beats the generate. The women gather round her. A flower-girl, Madeleine Louison Chabry, being young, handsome, and witty, is selected by the women as their orator. On marches the procession towards the Hotel de Ville. All the women whom they meet on the way are forced to join the ranks. If any remonstrate, they are threatened with the punishment of having their hair cut off. \" All women gather and go ; crowds storm all stairs, force out all women ; the female Insurrectionary Force, according to Camille, resembles the English Naval one ; there is a universal ' press of women.' Robust dames of the Halle, slim mantua-makers, assiduous, risen with the dawn ; ancient virginity tripping to matins ; the house maid with early broom, \u2014 all must go. Rouse ye, 0 women ; the laggard men will not act ; they say we our selves may act ! Battles ever since Homer's time, when they were fighting mobs, have mostly ceased to be worth looking at, worth reading of, or remembering. How many wearisome blood battles does history strive to rep resent, or even, in a husky way, to sing; \u2014 and she would omit or carelessly slur over this one Insurrection of Women ? \" \u00bb A company of National Guards obstruct their march. The daring women attack them with a shower of stones. The soldiers humanely refuse to fire upon them. The undaunted women then force their way into the Hdtel de Ville. They wander through all the rooms and offi ces ; demanding of all they meet that they should be provided with bread and arms. Some of the women, 1 Carlyle."], [236, "192 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ravenous and wild, threaten to set fire to the H6tel de Ville. Now doors are battered down with hatchets ; the women have broken into the armory ; have seized guns and cannon, and have straightway lighted danger ous torches. At this moment a gigantic man dressed in black appears in their midst. They mistake him for a traitor, and make ominous signs of killing him. But he announces himself as one of the conquerors of the Bas tile, and the women hail him with applause. He offers to conduct them to Versailles, and meanwhile sends word to the aide-major-general, that he, Maillard, will lead the women to Versailles \u2014 thus giving La Fayette and Bailly time to collect their troops. Accordingly Maillard places himself at the head of that motley crowd, and beating a drum, he is followed by seven or eight thousand women, with a few men dressed in female attire, and a company of the volunteers of the Bastile. \" What rub-a-dub is that ? Stanislas Maillard, Bastile hero, will lead us to Versailles. Joy to thee, Maillard ; blessed are thou above riding ushers ! Away, then away ! 0 Maillard, when, since war first was, had general of force such a task before him as thou this day ? Walter the Penniless still touches the feeling heart ; but then Walter had sanction ; had space to turn in ; and also his crusaders were of the male sex. Thou, this day, art general of Menads. Their inarticulate frenzy thou must, on the spur of the instant, render into articulate words, into actions that are not frantic. Fail in it, this way or that ! Pragmatical officiality, with its penalties and law-books, waits before thee; Menads storm behind. If suoh hewed off the melodious head of Orpheus, and hurled it into the Peneus waters, what may they not make of thee, \u2014 thee rhythmic merely, with no music but a sheepskin drum ! \u2014 Maillard did not fail. Re-"], [237, "THE CROWD SHOUT, \"TO VERSAILLES.\""], [238, ""], [239, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 193 markable Maillard, if fame were not an accident, and history a distillation of rumor, how remarkable wert thou ! \" l Onward marches the procession through Chaillot, Au teuil, and Sevres. Much persuasion must Maillard em ploy that his followers steal not food. At Sevres they pause, and Commander Maillard orders all bakers of the town to produce their stores. There were eight loaves in all ; thirty -two pounds of bread among eight thousand persons ! Surely light meal that. Fainting with hunger and fatigue, many of the women lay down their arms. Maillard counsels that they shall not arrive in such war like fashion. Thereupon the cannon are prudently placed in the rear of the procession. Politic Maillard also sug gests to the women that they sing the air of Henri IV. as they enter Versailles. \" Vivent nos Parisiennes ! \" cry the delighted people of Versailles. The procession ar rives at the National Assembly. All the women desire to enter. Again Maillard must employ much persuasive diplomacy. At length, after many discussions, fifteen of their number are delegated to accompany Maillard. Upon entering the Assembly, Maillard said : \" We come to demand bread, and the punishment of the body-guard who have insulted the cockade. We are good patriots ; on our road we have torn down the black cockades, and I shall have the pleasure of tearing one before the As sembly.\" The women impatiently shouted together, \"Bread! Bread ! \" \" It is rumored,\" continued Maillard, \" that a miller in Paris has received from some one two hundred francs to induce him not to grind, with a promise of more if he will obey the command.\" \" Name him ! \" exclaimed the Assembly. 1 Carlyle."], [240, "194 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" It is the Archbishop of Paris ! \" shouted the women. At that moment a tri-colored cockade was brought in, sent by the body-guard. The women shouted, \"God save the king and the body-guard ! \" and thereupon the depu ties, including the president, Mounier, in spite of resist ance, found themselves seized in the arms of the women, and embraced whether they would or no, while the ex cited females exclaimed: \"But where is our Mirabeau? We should like to see our Count de Mirabeau.\" Mounier, \" surrounded, kissed, and nearly stifled,\" was forced to set out with a deputation from the Assembly, and the crowd of shouting women, through the mud and the rain, which fell in torrents ; passing through a multi tude armed in the most fantastical fashion. Body-guards were patrolling and galloping hither and thither, and they mistook the peaceable deputies for the invading mob, and Mounier and his Assembly companions were forced to flee ignominiously through the mud and crowds, and run for their very lives. From three till eight in the evening that vast multitude of women had waited patiently in the rain; no violence, unless some unruly shouting, rather pardonable under the circumstances, might have been termed violent. Only a child threw stones. Mounier, accompanied by his deputy of women, was at length allowed to enter the palace. The king lis tened to the women with much kindness. The young girl Louison Chabry, who had been appointed orator, was unfortunately attacked with stage fright, when she found herself in such august surroundings, and faintly mur muring, \" Bread ! \" she fell in a swoon at the king's feet. Louis ordered her to be taken care of ; and when she re vived, so great was her gratitude that she kissed the king's hand and ran out to her companions, crying, \" Vive le Roi ! \" The women waiting in the court below,"], [241, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 195 furious at her becoming a royalist, declared that she had been bribed. In vain did she show empty pockets ; the mob were about to strangle her, but she was released from their grasp. Whereupon they demanded that she be forced to return to the king, and obtain from him a written order to send for corn. But Mounier and his deputation from the Assembly did not succeed so well with the king. The Assembly had commissioned them to request his acceptance of the Declaration of Rights. Hour after hour they waited in vain. The king, who had been pursuing his favorite pastime of hunting, had been hurried home from Meu don, when the populace arrived at Versailles ; but at ten o'clock in the evening nothing had yet been decided. M. Necker desired that the king should go to Paris, and trust himself to the people ; in short, that he should accept the Revolution. But Louis XVI. dismissed his council without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion. The queen and the court suggested that his majesty should leave the palace secretly and put himself at the head of his troops. Louis strode up and down his apart ment, murmuring, \" A king a fugitive ! \" The queen gave orders for the carriages. But it was then too late. There was no longer any chance for escape ; the king was a prisoner. Meanwhile the women waiting in the drizzling rain in the courtyards of the palace determined to win over to their cause the soldiers stationed there. A certain Mademoiselle TMroigne de M^ricourt, handsome, elo quent, and fascinating, had become an enthusiastic parti san of the Revolution. She frequented the meetings of the Assembly, visited political clubs, and even held one at her own house, which became a resort for deputies aud the leaders of the Revolution. When the crowd of"], [242, "196 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. women started for Versailles, Mademoiselle Theroigne had mounted one of the cannon, match in hand, where \" with pike and helmet, she sat there as gunneress, with haughty eye and serene fair countenance ; comparable to the Maid of Orleans, or even recalling the idea of Pallas Athene.\" This irresistible young lady heads the band of women about to attack the hearts of the soldiers, their missiles being pleasing glances and soft words, which work a more efficient persuasion over the regiment of Flanders than bristling bayonets and booming cannon. \" One reads that Theroigne had bags of money, which she dis tributed to the regiment of Flanders. Alas ! with money bags, one seldom sits on insurrectionary cannon. Money she had not, but brown locks, the figure of a heathen goddess, and an eloquent tongue and heart.\" Meanwhile the body-guards file off, giving and receiv ing shots, but wounding no one. Draggled were their white cockades, which they had better have got exchanged for tri-colored ones ; for the hatred of the motley crowd vented itself upon the unpopular body-guards whither soever they turned. So far no lives had been lost, save that of the horse of one of the body-guards, which was seized by the mob, killed, and hastily roasted by a bivouac fire, and eagerly devoured half raw by the starving crowds. Louis meanwhile walks up and down his palace floors, ir resolute ; not yet will he sign the Declaration of Rights. President Mounier waits without the door of the council chamber. About four thousand of the multitude betake themselves to the Assembly-rooms. The women fill the galleries, and a fish-wife directs their shouts and offers opinions of her own. \" Who is that speaking yonder ? \" she cries ; \" make that chatterbox hold his prating ! That is not the question ! The thing is to have bread ! Let them rather hear our darling little Mirabeau.\""], [243, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 197 Whereupon her female followers chime in chorus, \" Where is our darling mother Mirabeau ? \" At ten o'clock in the evening a young man rushed into the palace in breathless affright, disguised like one of the mob. This young Duke of Richelieu had mingled with the crowd now on their way from Paris, unwillingly led by La Fayette and a part of his National Guards. Duke Richelieu had been so horrified by the violent language and atrocious threats that had been freely indulged in by the advancing populace, that he hastened on before them to give warning to the royal family. The vacillating king became at length convinced that he must do something. He accordingly signed the Dec laration of Rights, which Mounier carried triumphantly to the Assembly. The women crowded around him and dubiously in quired, \"But, M. President, will this give bread to the poor people of Paris ? we are very hungry ; we have eaten nothing to-day.\" No wonder that this signing seemed to the ignorant crowds a strange method of fill ing empty mouths. Mounier, as a more convincing proof of the good-will of the king, ordered food to be brought straightway to the hungry women. Munching the bread, the incredulous women became more easily persuaded of the efficacy of the king's promise, and they chatted familiarly with the deputies ; one significantly remark ing to Mounier, \" But, dear President, why did you defend that villanous veto? Beware of the lanterne!\" Again they called for Mirabeau, and messengers were forced to go and seek him, make him rise from bed, and come to the Assembly and let his voice be heard by these fish wives, who would not be denied the privilege of beholding their beloved Mirabeau. Ill-pleased at such unsuitable disturbance, the idolized Mirabeau was in no fit humor"], [244, "198 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. for their adulations ; and striding into the Assembly, he shouted in thunder-tones : \" I should like to know how people have the assurance to come and trouble our meeting! M. President, make them respect the Assembly ! \" \" Bravo ! \" cried the delighted women, gazing with admiration upon the angry face of their adored hero, as one whispered to another, \" See ! here is our darling mother Mirabeau ! \" Six hours had La Fayette been upon the road from Paris to Versailles. He had been forced to lead the multitude. Fifteen thousand of his National Guard accompanied him. Purposely had he marched slowly through the drenching rain, frequently pausing to ha rangue the crowd, and making his soldiers renew their oath to defend the king and the National Assembly. At midnight La Fayette arrived, and sent notice of his coming to the king, who replied, \" that he would see him with pleasure, and that he had just accepted his Declaration of Rights.\" La Fayette entered the Chateau alone. His courage in doing so was remarked ; for many of the court con sidered his protestations of being forced to accompany this riotous mob as a pretension ; and many of the court iers were his bitter enemies. Madame de Stael, who was present, says of his dig nified bearing, \" He appeared very calm ; nobody ever saw him otherwise.\" The more important La Fayette's position, the more respectful was his demeanor. King, queen, court, and nation now awaited the commands of La Fayette. The wet and bedrizzled multitudes found shelter for the night, as best they could, in empty barns and churches, spare barracks, and coffee-houses. The Assembly had broken up at three o'clock; and Mailliard,"], [245, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 199 with many of the women, had departed for Paris, bearing the decrees on corn, and the Declaration of Rights signed by the king. La Fayette and D'Estaing meanwhile settle the watches. The outer posts of the castle are entrusted to the National Guards, while the body-guards watch within. The park has been mostly cleared of its troops, they having been sent to Rambouillet. \" The troublous day has brawled itself to rest ; no lives yet lost but that of one war-horse. Insurrectionary chaos lies slumbering round the Palace, like ocean round a diving-bell, \u2014 no crevice yet disclosing itself.\" l But in that slumbering chaos are many furious fa natics who would fain see blood flow. Camille Desmou lins says : \" M. Marat flies to Versailles, returns like lightning, and makes alone as much noise as the four trumpets of the Day of Judgment, shouting, ' 0 death, arise ! ' \" And though there may not be historical evidence that M. Marat was the first to suggest sanguinary violence at Versailles, as he had at this time probably returned to Paris, still there were others to repeat his threatening words or propose them of their own accord ; and it needed but the match of a body-guard gazing forth from a win dow of the Palace about five o'clock on the morning of the 6th to light the flames of riotous revenge which soon surged and blazed with relentless fury. An unarmed National Guard is stabbed \u2014 poor Jer6me l'Heritier. He reels, death-stricken, falls on the pave ment, and the women lift his corpse and lay it down on the marble steps. The body-guards must pay dearly for this. \"Woe now to all body-guards ! mercy is none for them. In a few moments the gate of the Court of Mar ble is forced open ; up the Grand Staircase, up all stairs 1 Carlyle."], [246, "200 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. and entrances, rushes the living deluge. Deshuttes and Varigny, the two sentry body-guards, are trodden down, are massacred with a hundred pikes. Women snatch their cutlasses, 'or any weapon, and storm in, menadic. Miomandre de Sainte-Marie pleads with soft words on the Grand Staircase, ' descending four steps,' to the roaring tornado. His comrades snatch him up by the skirts and belts literally from the jaws of destruction, and slam to their door. This also will stand few in stants, the panels shivering in like potsherds. Barricad ing serves not ; fly fast, ye body-guards ! rabid insurrec tion, like the hell-hound chase, uproaring at your heels ! \" 1 The most furious attack was made in the direction of the queen's apartments. Marie Antoinette is roused from slumber by the startling cry, \" Save the Queen ! \" Brave Miomandre shouts a second warning, \" Save the Queen ! \" and turns to meet and fight the foe. Direfully wounded and left for dead at the queen's outer door, he shall yet live to be honored for his daring courage in defence of his sovereign. But while Miomandre fights, the queen flees ; hastily wrapped, \u2014 not in robes of state, \u2014 she speeds with her two waiting-women across the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf to the king's apartment, where her children are also brought, and falling sobbing into her husband's arms, the woman for a moment replaces the queen ; \" the imperial-hearted bursts into mother's tears,\" as she cries, \" O mes amis ! sauvez-moi et mes enfans ! \" Louder and louder is the ominous knocking at the barricaded door of the \u0152il-de-B\u0153uf. Piled-up benches, stools, and furniture guard the entrance ; but in spite of this precaution, the lower panel is burst in. Death seems imminent. But at this critical moment the roar ceases ; a kind voice is heard, \" Come open to us body- 1 Carlyle."], [247, "INVASION OF THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER."], [248, ""], [249, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 201 guard! we have not forgotten that you men saved us French Guards at Fontenoy ! \" The French Guards, now become National Guards, with the brave Hoche, then a simple sergeant-major, at their head, are received with relieved delight. The door is opened; brother soldiers fall weeping into each other's arms. \" The peo ple had come to save the nobility. \" The king, mistaking these friends for assassins, cried, \"Do not hurt my guards ! \" But the danger was past. La Fayette had already arrived from the neighboring chateau, where at five o'clock in the morning he had retired for a little rest. Surrounded by his hastily summoned National Guards, he appeared in the tumult, and with \"prompt military word of command,\" restores order, and the \"death-melly ceases; the king's apartments are now safe ; \" ministers and officials may safely assemble. La Fayette enters the palace ; Madame Adelaide, the king's aunt, rushes up to him, exclaiming, \" It is you who have saved us ! \" Not stopping for her adulation, La Fayette hurries on to the king's apartment. In the midst of all the confusion, still stands a punctilious master of cere monies before the door ; \" The king grants you les grandes entries,\" obsequiously declares this functionary of eti quette, bowing deferentially to the general. Thus glim mers and erelong dies out forever the last spark of court etiquette ; for none hereafter shall grace the fallen court of poor Louis XVI. And soon shall \" Sire \" and \" Your Majesty \" be denied him ; and later plain Louis Capet be all of title vouchsafed to this unfortunate sovereign. The queen was standing near a window, with her daughter and the dauphin. The young prince was play with his sister's hair. \"Mamma, I am hungry,\" ex claimed the child. Poor little prince ! Awakened at this early hour by the wild tumult of the mob, as soon"], [250, "202 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. as his fright is lessened, he feels the need of food. \" Hunger passes from the people to the king. Pardon ! this one is but a child.\" But how many little children in Paris have gone hungry for months and even years ? Unfortunate little prince ! what anguish, what cruel tor ture, he should yet have to endure ! It would seem as though in his one short life was meted out to him all the pain, neglect, hunger, and torments which French children had suffered for long centuries of oppression. Truly Louis XVII. expiated in his own person the sins and cruelties of his ancestors. Upon that golden head, now shining like a halo of glory, will erelong fall such unutterable woes as shall make the narrative of his life unparalleled in history. Men and women have endured equal or greater sufferings, but no child in the annals of the world was ever forced to endure such diabolical cruelty. But his childish request for food is not heard now by the hungry mob ; and as King Louis steps into the bal cony, the people cry, \" Vive le roi!\" and then they shout, \"The Queen!\" \"What! all alone?\" asks Marie An toinette, naturally shrinking for a moment from that same populace which a few hours before had pierced her empty bed with their swords, thinking thereby to make an end of her Majesty, not knowing that she had fled; but soon the daughter of Maria Theresa recovers herself, and boldly, nay, proudly and imperi ously, steps out before the menacing crowd, even though she knows a bullet may be sent through her heart. La Fayette, standing by her side, with exquisite tact and chivalrous respect, bends and raises her fair hand to his lips ; for that trembling woman, trembling though her proud eyes flash fire, the Knight of Liberty risks his popularity, his destiny, yes, even his life. It was a noble"], [251, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 203 deed. The multitude recognized her courage and his chivalry, and as one voice exclaimed, \" Oh ! how beauti ful she is ! \" the crowd shouted, \" Vive la Reine ! \" As the queen stepped back into the apartment, the king said to La Fayette, \"My guards! could you not also do something for them? \" Whereupon La Fayette led one of the body-guards upon the balcony, wearing now a national cockade upon his hat instead of the hated Austrian black or royal white ; and as the guard lifted his hat and kissed the tri-color cockade, the people shouted, \" Vivent les gardes-du-corps ! \" The friendly grenadiers then exchanged caps with the guards, and thus the people's wrath was appeased. The insult to the tri-color has been avenged, but the people demand still another concession. \" Le Roi d, Paris ! \" is now the cry. \"Yes, The King to Paris! what else? Ministers may consult, and National Deputies wag their heads, but there is no other possibility. You have forced him to go willingly.\" \"Till one o'clock, then, National Assembly, National Rascality, and National Royalty will all be busy enough. Rascality rejoices ; women trim themselves with tri color. Nay, motherly Paris has sent her avengers suffi cient ' cartloads of loaves,' which are shouted over, which are gratefully consumed. The avengers, in return, are searching for grain-stores, loading them in fifty wagons, that so a National king, probable harbinger of all bless ings, may be the evident bringer of plenty. And thus has Sansculottism made prisoner its king, revoking his parole. The Monarchy has fallen, and not so much as honorably \u2014 no, ignominiously ; with struggle, indeed, oft repeated, but then with unwise struggle, wasting its strength in fits and paroxysms ; at every new paroxysm foiled more pitifully than before. Poor Monarchy ! But"], [252, "204 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. what save foulest defeat can await that man who wills and yet wills not? Apparently the king either has a right, assertible as such to the death, before God and man, or else he has no right. Apparently the one or the other, could he but know which. May Heaven pity him ! Were Louis wise, he would this day abdicate.\" 1 Hearing that the king had consented to depart for Paris, the Assembly, on Mirabeau's motion, voted that they were inseparable from the king, and likewise pre pared to attend him. \" But here, meanwhile, the question arises, was Philippe d'Orleans seen this day ' in the Bois de Boulogne, in gray surtout,' waiting, under the wet, sere foliage, what the day might bring forth ? Alas ! yes, the Eidolon of him was, \u2014 in Weber's and other such brains. The Ch&telet shall make large inquisition into the matter, examining a hundred and seventy witnesses, and Deputy Chabroud publish his report, but disclose nothing farther. What, then, has caused these two unparalleled October days? For surely such dramatic exhibition never yet enacted itself without dramatist and machinist. \"Wooden Punch emerges not with his domestic sor rows into the light of day unless the wire be pulled ; how can human mobs ? Was it not D'Orleans, then, and Laclos, Marquis Sillery, Mirabeau and the sons of confu sion, hoping to drive the king to Metz, and gather the spoil ? Nay, was it not quite contrariwise, the \u0152il-de- B\u0153uf, Body-Guard Colonel de Guiche, Minister Saint- Priest, and highflying Loyalists, hoping also to drive him to Metz, and try it by the sword of civil war ?

Bertrand de Molleville thus describes the scene : \" The king did not leave Versailles till one o'clock. The queen, the dauphin, Madame Royale, Monsieur, Madame Elizabeth, and Madame de Tourzel, were in his majesty's car riage. The hundred deputies in their carriages came next. A detachment of brigands, bearing the heads of the two body-guards in triumph, formed an advanced guard, and had set out two hours earlier. These had carried their cruelty to the length of forcing an un fortunate hairdresser to arrange the gory heads, which appeared all the more ghastly for their curled and pow dered locks. \"The king's carriage was preceded by the fish-wives, who had arrived the day before from Paris, and a whole rabble of women, drunk with fury and wine. Several of them rode upon the cannons, singing ribald songs. Wagons full of corn formed a train escorted by grena diers, and surrounded by women armed with pikes, or carrying long branches of poplar. Behind his majesty's carriage were several of his faithful guards, some on foot, and some on horseback, most of them unarmed, and worn out with hunger and fatigue; the dragoons, the Flanders regiment, the hundred Swiss, and the National Guards, preceded, accompanied, or followed the file of carriages. I witnessed this heartrending spectacle; I saw the ominous procession. In the midst of all the tumult, clamor, singing, interrupted by frequent dis charges of musketry, which the hand of an enemy or a bungler might so easily render fatal, I saw the queen, preserving the most courageous tranquillity, and an air of nobleness and inexpressible dignity, and my eyes were suffused with tears of admiration and grief.\" Michelet says : \" The whole spectacle was at once gay"], [254, "206 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. and melancholy, joyous and gloomy. The rain fell in torrents ; they marched but slowly through the muddy road. The women cried, 'We are bringing back the baker, his wife, and the little baker boy.' The royal carriage, surrounded by an escort, and with La Fayette at the door, moved like a hearse.\" Thus the king was brought to Paris. \"Poor Louis has two other Paris processions to make, \u2014 one ludicrous ignominious like this ; the other not ludicrous nor igno minious, but serious, nay, sublime.\" Michelet says: \"The Revolution of the 6th of Octo ber, necessary, natural, and justifiable, if any ever was, entirely spontaneous, unforeseen, and tridy popular, be longs especially to women, as that of the 14th of July does to the men. The men took the Bastile, and the women took the king. On the 1st of October every thing was marred by the ladies of Versailles ; on the 6th, all was repaired by the women of Paris.\" The king having been persuaded or forcibly taken, according as authorities are royalist or republican, is at length with his dear people in Paris. In a sort of im prisonment, some assert, guarded by La Fayette and the National Guards, but according to La Fayette himself, by no means a captive, but free to resume his hunting parties if he chose. It seems evident, however, when the conflicting ac counts are somewhat adjusted, that the people were delighted to have their king amongst them, and that they manifested amicable pleasure whenever he appeared before them. What Louis might have done at this time is not quite clear. Michelet says : \" He could have easily withdrawn either to Rouen, as Mirabeau advised him, or to Metz, and the army commanded by Bouille, as the queen desired.\" But at all events it seems as though"], [255, "RETURN OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TO PARIS."], [256, ""], [257, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 207 he could now have gained the affections of the people, who greeted him with warm applause, had he taken Necker's advice and accepted the Revolution. What he did do was to vacillate or do nothing, which was irretriev able ruin. La Fayette and Mirabeau, the one the most popular, the other the most eloquent, in France, were at this time royalists ; that is \u2014 they were in favor of a lim ited monarchy, though La Fayette's republican principles were the same ; but recognizing- that France was not in a condition to govern herself in a republic, he favored a constitutional king. Whether or no the Duke of Orleans had been instru mental in bringing the populace to Versailles, La Fay ette deemed him so dangerous to the peace of the country, that he induced him to go to England; and Mirabeau being thus deprived of the patronage of the duke, offered to join with La Fayette in the overthrow of Necker, and the disposition of the government. Had this been done, the king might have been saved ; but La Fayette would not listen to the proposals of Mira beau, whom he did not esteem ; and as the court bitterly hated both Mirabeau and La Fayette, these two powers, genius and popularity, were only united for a time in behalf of the king, and the early death of Mirabeau, and the foreign war which called La Fayette to the frontier, removed from Paris the only two men who could have saved Louis. Already many members of the National Assembly had emigrated, the president, Mounier, amongst them, whose experience of the dear people on the 5th and 6th of Octo ber had not been such as to make him longer desire a resi dence in their midst. Carlyle says : \" As for the National Assembly, its extreme want of bodily health may be noted. After the fourteenth of July there was a certain"], [258, "208 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. sickliness observable among honorable members ; so many demanding passports on account of infirm health. But now for these following days there is a perfect murrain ; President Mounier, Lally Tollendal, Clermont Tonnere, and all Constitutional Two-Chamber Royalists needing change of air, as most No-Chamber Royalists had formerly done. For, in truth, it is the second Emi gration that has now come ; most extensive among Com mons, Deputies, Noblesse, Clergy ; so that ' to Switzerland alone go sixty thousand.' They will return in the day of accounts ! Yes, and have hot welcome. But emigra tion on emigration is the peculiarity of France.\" Before we describe the memorable Federation of July 14, 1790, we hastily sum up the principal events of note during the year 1790. The National Assembly removes to Paris, and meeting in the Salle de Manege, the riding-hall of the Tuileries, it assumes the name of the Constituent Assembly, and thereupon continues its arduous labors in regenerating France. And surely this work of regen eration is no small task. Everything is in a chaotic state. One hundred thousand beggars are starving in Paris ; and millions more would have been quickly added from the provinces had not each municipality been forced by law to keep their starving population at home. Every body complains and implores the help of the Assembly. If things remain thus, its task will soon be to feed the entire nation. The resources of the government are the estates of the crown and the clergy. The rich patrimony of the prelates was for the most part the bequests of pious ancestors in behalf of the poor. So in reality these estates belong by right to the people. This property of the poor held by the clergy was estimated at four thou sand millions of francs. \" The people now go and knock at the door of the church, their own mansion, to ask for"], [259, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 209 a part of a property the whole of which is their own \u2014 ' Panem ! propter Deum ! ' [Bread ! for the love of God !] Give, if you are Christians ; the poor are the members of Christ. Give, if you are citizens ; for the people are the living city. Pay back, if you are honest ; for this property was only a deposit.\" But the clergy will not of their own accord relinquish these fat estates ; the Assembly must command ; and so tithes are abolished ; ecclesiastical property is declared national property ; assignats are created ; monastic vows are abolished ; religious orders are suppressed ; lettres de-cachet are abolished ; the salt-tax is suppressed ; and Protestants are restored to their political rights. This is accomplished not without stormy sittings and various revolts, the most bitter discussions arising regarding the selling of ecclesiastic property to raise the money needed for the maintenance of the nation. The Abb6 Maury, together with Mirabeau-Tonneau, the orator's elder brother, are the leaders in behalf of the clergy : and the Abbe Gregoire, Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun, and the Abbe' Fauchet espouse the cause of the people in this hand-to-hand \" contest for royalty waged by the sons of the Church.\" Maury was a consummate orator and debater, and possessed of the most daring courage. Being at one time seized by the mob in Paris, which pursued him with the fatal cry of \" A la Lanterne ! \" he coolly turned to them and said with the utmost sang-froid, \" And when you have put me in the place of the lamp, do you imagine that you will see the better ? \" This remark saved his life. The crowd received it with laughter, and the Abbe was allowed to proceed on his way unmolested. Strange scenes follow the abolition of sacred orders. Monks appear in the streets in powdered wigs and"], [260, "210 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. fashionable frocks, blue breeches, and buckled shoes. Amusing dialogues are overheard in the caf6s : \" What the dickens do you want with the cowl and sandals ? Wait till I get you a coat and sword.\" And, again, in barber shops : \" Don't cut off all his beard ; leave him his mustachios.\" And the ceremony concludes by a visit to the clothing stores, where the Capuchins doff their priestly attire, and don that of the Paris dandy. Behold also revolutionary zeal invaded all quarters ! Patriotic gifts flowed in from many avenues. The pio neers in this generous mania were twelve women of the middle class, wives and daughters of some Parisian artists. They brought to the National Assembly, one day, a cas ket containing ninety-three playing counters or fishes in silver, three goblets, and twenty-four silver buttons, four pair of gold bracelets, three lockets, five watch-cases, eight rings, three pairs of ear-rings, five thimbles, purse slides, work-boxes, dressing-cases, a medal of Frederick V. of Denmark, and a purse containing sixteen louis. The nation voted that the faces of these twelve \" Roman ladies of the eighteenth century \" should be preserved by means of portraits or medallions for posterity. This spirit of sacrifice soon became contagious, and spread throughout all circles. Women relinquished their lockets, chains, diamonds, and jewels of all kinds ; and the men, not to be outdone, took the gold and silver buckles from their shoes, thereby introducing a new fashion, that of steel buckles, in their place. These be came the \" boucles a la nation.\" It was estimated that the collective \" bucklehood \" of the French nation amounted in value to forty millions of francs. The Marquis de Villette brought the buckles of his household strung on a skewer, and took to wearing brass seals to his watch chain, proposing to the king to imitate the times of"], [261, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 211 Henri IV. by wearing silken bows to his shoes. The offerings on the altar of national bankruptcy continued. The king sent 4721 pounds of silver and 150 pounds of gold plate to the mint, including the magnificent gold dinner-service of St. Cloud. The queen also contributed 1803 pounds in silver plate ; and even the handles of the royal dinner-knives were thrown into the melting-pot. Many nobles redeemed their silver plate from the national pawn-office to part with it forever. The livery-stable keepers of Paris brought the gold and silver vessels from the church of their patron saint. The notary clerks contributed 7437 francs. The fencing-masters of Paris brought their swords, saying, \" Our swords are composed of two metals, \u2014 silver and steel. Accept the first for the pressing needs of the moment. We swear to employ the second in the service of the nation, for the maintenance of liberty.\" M. Necker gave 100,000 francs ; an actress, her silver toilet-service ; the managers of the king's ballet sent an ounce of golden jewels; the Marchioness de Sillery-Genlis donated the silver toilet-service of her daughter. And thus the gifts poured in. \"From high to low, society emptied its pockets.\" Children even sent their hoarded franc pieces, and the wealthy little ones their golden toys. Clubs are spreading everywhere. The Jacobin Club meets in the Rue St. Honore ; the Club of the Cordeliers constitutes itself ; and the Feuillant Club meets in the Feuillant Convent. And then, too, the Royalist Club convenes from time to time, sitting on damask sofas, but accomplishes little or nothing, notwithstanding its regal surroundings. The women, too, will not be outdone in this club business. They found \"La SociM des Femmes Republicaines et Rivolutionnaires \" and \" La Society des Amies de la Constitution.\" Neither are they inactive"], [262, "212 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. clubs. The members take an oath never to have an aris tocrat for a husband ; and when the men hesitate about passing some ultra edicts, they threaten to march in four separate legions unless the decree should be promul gated in a week. The abolition of feudal rights and suppression of all titles of nobility occasioned some amusing scenes. Crests and heraldic devices were dear to many hearts. Some concealed their arms under silver paper or a curtain. One nobleman covered his shield with a cloud painted in distemper, beneath which appeared the words, \"A passing cloud.\" A noble lady had a death's-head with cross-bones painted upon the panel of her carriage. One lord, com pelled to take off the gold lace from his servants' liveries, forbade the tailor to turn the coats, that the marks of the offending lace might still be visible. It is reported that many of the titled lords who so generously relin quished their names of rank on the momentous night of August 4 were obliged to listen to many private curtain lectures from their displeased wives. The tennis-keepers, too, must straightway scratch out the epithet \" noble \" from their signs. Instead of \" Noble Game of Goose,\" appears now \" The Game of the French Revolution.\" In this new game the geese become the Parliaments ; Num ber 19, the \" Hostelry, \" or the \" Palais Royal,\" principal centre of the revolutionary movement ; Number 31, the \" refugees in foreign lands \" ; Number 58, the \" death of Delaunay and other enemies to the Revolution \" ; and Number 63, the winning number, the \" Constituent Assem bly,\" or the \" palladium of liberty.\" The linkman of the Thedtre Frangais, who for twenty years has every night with stentorian voice called out the names of earls, dukes, marquises, and counts as he summoned their carriages, becomes so much chagrined at"], [263, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 213 the loss of all these high-sounding titles, that he cannot bring himself to pronounce their present names, shorn of all their former gradiloquence, and he thereupon resigns his position. Meanwhile an unfortunate baker is killed by mistake by the mob, which occasions a severe law regarding put ting down of tumultuous street assemblies of the people. \" This is that famed Martial Law (Loi Martiale), a kind of riot act, with its red flag, its 'Drapeau Rouge' ; in virtue of which Mayor Bailly, or any mayor, has but henceforth to hang out that new Oriflamme of his ; then to read or mumble something about the king's peace ; and, after certain pauses, serve any undispersing assem blage with musket-shot, or wdiatever shot will disperse it,- \u2014 -a decisive law, and most just on one proviso: that all patrollotism be of God, and all mob assembling be of the devil ; otherwise, not so just. Mayor Bailly, be unwilling to use it ! Hang not out that new Oriflamme, flame not of gold, but of the want of gold. But now let no mortal say henceforth that an august National Assem bly wants riot : all it ever wanted was riot enough to balance court-plotting ; all it now wants, of heaven or of earth, is to get its theory of defective verbs perfected.\" ' On the 4th of February the king visited the Assembly. He made an affecting speech which filled every one with delight and surprise. \" His Majesty's speech, in diluted conventional phraseology, expresses this mainly : that he, most of all Frenchmen, rejoices to see France getting regenerated; is sure, at the same time, that they will deal gently with her in the process, and not regenerate her roughly. Such was his Majesty's speech. The feat he performed was coming to speak it, and going back again.\" ' What could the Assembly do but testify its 1 Carlyle."], [264, "214 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. gratitude ? A deputation of thanks follows the king to the palace, is there received also by the queen, who presents to them the dauphin, saying in her gracious and gracefully imperious manner, \"Here is my son. I will teach him to cherish liberty, and I hope he will be its support.\" It is now moved in the National Assembly that they should all renew the National Oath. Whereupon the president swears, the members swear, the galleries swear, each man lifting the right hand, exclaiming, \"Je le jure!\" Nay, more : Bailly, at the Hotel de Ville, will swear the municipalities ; and, as it is suggested that the people would like also to swear, Bailly, with an escort of twelve, steps forth upon the street, and the multitudes, with stretched hands, take the oath to the sound of drums and shouts which make the welkin ring. Nor is this all. Not only Paris, but all the provinces, would also be pleased to swear ; whereupon, in district after district, the people gather in the square and enact the \"Je le jure\" to the accompaniment of drums and embracings marvellous to behold. Thus does France swear to be faithful to the king, to the law, and to the constitution, which the Assembly has still to make. \"But an august National Assembly, as it goes on regenerating France, must hear not only of Brissot and his Friends of the Blacks, but by and by of a whole St. Domingo blazing skyward ; blazing in literal fire, and in far worse metaphorical ; beaconing the nightly main.\" It must hear also \"of the shipping interest, and the landed interest, and all manner of interests, reduced to distress ; of industry everywhere manacled, bewildered, and only rebellion thriving ; of sub-officers, soldiers, and sailors in mutiny by land and water ; of soldiers at Nanci needing to be cannonaded by a brave Bouille ; of sailors,"], [265, "DANTON."], [266, ""], [267, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 215 nay, the very galley-slaves, at Brest, needing also to be cannonaded, but with no Bouille to do it.\" 1 Other things, too, are visible at this time. Riots are contagious, and spread from province to province; and \"to the dullest peasant, as he sits sluggish, over-toiled, by his evening hearth, one idea has come, that of cha teaux burnt, of chateaux combustible.\" Also many new figures are beginning to glide into the foreground of the picture. \" Dogleech Marat \" we already know, but shall erelong observe Chaumette, an able sub-editor, \"who shall rise to the very gallows,\" and \"Clerk Tallien shall be come able editor and more \" ; Herbois, \" who listens with that black, bushy head to the sound of the world's drama. Happy now, indeed, for all manner of mimetic, half-origi nal men ! Limitation of mind, then vehemence, prompti tude, audacity, shall all be available ; to which add only these too, cunning and good lungs. Good fortune must be presupposed.\" Given these environs, and behold the rising \" attorney class,\" \u2014 Bazires, Carriers, Fouquier- Tinvilles, Basoch-Captain-Bourdons, and more. Danton waxes greater in his Cordeliers Club ; Mirabeau is yet thundering forth his eloquent words ; General Dumouriez has come back to Paris to continue his political intrigues, which shall end in treason ; and from all parts of Europe flock to Paris, intriguers, politicians, pamphleteers, busy bodies, and thieves. All desire to have a look at this marvellous Revolution, and, if possible, to have a fat finger in the pie, if so be that there be any pie, and not merely promising crust filled with emptiness. Mean while French nobles flee abroad. Strange that some persons are so much in need of the rejuvenating power of the air of France just at this time, and the health of others so imperatively demands that they straightway i Carlyle."], [268, "216 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. seek other climes. What would human nature and human circumstances do without these convenient commands of family physicians, ordering immediate change of air and scene ? But some shall get change of scene, though not by travel. The Marquis Favras, for instance. It was reported that Monsieur, the king's brother, had conceived a pretty plan, involving the assassination of Bailly and La Fayette, and the carrying off of the king ; and Favras was the agent of Monsieur. The plot was discovered, and straightway Monsieur hastened to the city of Paris, and going before the municipal magistrates affirmed, with apparent innocence, that he had not the least complicity in this matter of Favras ; and thereupon he prated with hypocritical warmth of his revolutionary sentiments and love of liberty. The Marquis Favras, too noble to implicate Monsieur, remained silent concerning him ; and as he had been given to understand that it was necessary for him to die discreetly, he did so ; and courageously maintained silence regarding his accomplices ; and at night, by torch light, he was hanged. His papers were seized by a Paris magistrate, and these papers, which revealed the partici pation of Monsieur in the plot, were given up to Mon sieur, then Louis XVIIL, by the daughter of the magis trate, who had taken them from the unfortunate Favras. Louis burned these ominous signs of his former intrigues, in great haste. Michelet says of the influence of Austria over France in 1789 and 1790 : \" The queen had three advisers : Ver mond, ever in the Austrian interest ; Breteuil, no less so ; and lastly, M. Mercy d'Argenteau, the Austrian ambas sador. Behind this old man we may perceive another urging him forward, \u2014 old Prince de Kaunitz, for seventy years a minister of the Austrian monarchy. These two"], [269, "217 THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. coxcombs, or rather these old women, who seemed to be entirely occupied with the toilet and trifles, directed the queen of France.\" The death of Joseph II. placed Leopold on the Austrian throne, and the same Austrian intrigues continued. The courts at Vienna and Paris were in constant communica tion, and in the same month the two brothers-in-law, Louis XVI. and Leopold, both declared themselves the friends of liberty, and zealous defenders of constitutions. Leopold was thus acting to recover Belgium, and with him such pretence was politic, for thereby he was divid ing his enemies and strengthening his friends. On the contrary, such declarations from Louis XVI. discouraged his friends of the counter-revolution, paralyzed the clergy and nobility ; and though for a time it increased his influ ence with the revolutionary party, his actions were so vacillating, that little reliance could be placed upon such protestations. Marie Antoinette overlooked one irreparable opportu nity \u2014 the moment when La Fayette and Mirabeau were united in her favor. \" She was unwilling to be saved by the Revolution, or men such as Mirabeau and La Fayette ; this true princess of the House of Lorraine, courageous and proud, desired to conquer and be revenged. She risked everything inconsiderately, evidently thinking, that after all, as Henrietta of England said in a tempest, queens could not be drowned. Maria Theresa had been on the point of perishing, and yet had not perished. This heroic remembrance of the mother had much influ ence over the daughter, though without reason; the mother had the people on her side, and the daughter had them against her.\" 1 Marie Antoinette was also unwilling to trust her cause 1 Michelet."], [270, "218 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to the princes and emigrants ; she very properly dis trusted Monsieur and the Count d'Artois, the king's brothers. Her hopes seemed to have been placed in Bouille, the army, and Austria. \" In 1790 England began to cause great anxiety. The French Revolution had at first excited lively sympathy in that country ; but a reaction had very soon come among a goodly number of these English aristocrats, Whigs or Tories, who well saw that liberty and equality, as they were understood in France, differed widely from then privileged and traditional liberties. They feared lest French ideas might be introduced into their isle. About the commencement of the year 1790, a celebrated orator, who had until then manifested liberal sentiments, made a speech in the English Parliament against the French Revolution, pretending that it was the suicide of France ; that France would henceforth be only a vast waste on the map of Europe. This orator was Edmund Burke.\" He afterwards published a book entitled, \"Reflections upon the French Revolution.\" Thirty thousand copies of this book were circulated throughout all the courts of Europe ; meanwhile its author, through secret correspon dence, stirred up Queen Marie Antoinette, the French court, and the emigrants to conspire against the Revolu tion. \"No terms with rebels,\" cried he. \"Appeal to neighboring sovereigns, and above all confide in the aid of foreign armies.\" England had been alarmed at the proposed alliance between Belgium and France. She did not openly at tack France by arms ; but her minister, Mr. Pitt, is reported to have paid the talented and impassioned Burke for his furious philippic in Parliament, against the French Revolution ; and abandoning Belgium to the"], [271, "THE POPULACE AT VERSAILLES. 219 Emperor, England went to the other end of the world, to seek a quarrel with Spain, the ally of France. It was nearing the end of May, 1790. Marie Antoi nette and Louis XVI. were at St. Cloud. Mirabeau had been secretly treating with the court for some time. It was nearly a year since negotiations were first entered into, regarding winning the powerful influence of Mira beau to the side of the court. At first the queen expressed utter detestation of the man. Count de Reb \u2014 was commissioned by the queen to approach Mirabeau, and to endeavor to buy his powerful alliance. At first Mirabeau resented the offer of money, being just then well supplied with this, to him, rare article, but Mirabeau consented to use his influence, in case of being made minister. When Count de Reb \u2014 entered the royal cab inet, the queen advanced towards him, her countenance beaming with the anticipation of success. \" The king will be gratified by your zeal, Monsieur,\" she said to the plenipotentiary. \" Well, had you a good bargain of this man ? How much has he cost ? \" The count replied that, \" Mirabeau, with true magna nimity, had rejected all propositions of a pecuniary nature.\" He then mentioned the appointment to the ministry. At this the queen's cheek flushed, and then turned deadly pale. She closed her eyes, and striking her fore head with her hand, exclaimed : \" A minister ! Make Riquetti Mirabeau a minister ? Never, never will I allow the threshold of the king's council to be sullied by the footsteps of such a man ! \" She trembled with indignation, and continued : \" Let him have money \u2014 grant him all he asks for ; but to make him a minister ! Is it possible that my friends can give me this advice ? \" She then paced the room with"], [272, "220 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. every mark of agitation, repeating the words : \" A min ister, forsooth ! a minister ! \" The negotiations were for a time broken off; but a year later, Mirabeau being in want of money, which was his chronic complaint, and the queen finding her chances of success growing less, she consented to give an audience to Mirabeau. This meeting took place at St. Cloud, May, 1790. Strange meeting that ! Mirabeau, with the shadow of death hanging over his Titanic countenance, while his resistless eyes still blazed with the light of genius, and his elo quent words still flowed persuasive from his lips ; and Marie Antoinette, that rieerlessly royal woman, with the imperial dignity of Maria Theresa, and the heart of a king. He, the man of liberty, upholder of the people ; she, the incarnation of royalty, over whose delicate face the purple hues of grief have already cast their pathetic shadows, but whose queenly head is still carried with the old graceful hauteur, \u2014 genius and beauty, liberty and monarchy, now meet face to face. Marie Antoinette is surprised to find that Mirabeau, this fatal man, leader of the Revolution, and associated with all her ideas of what was monstrous and detestable, is never theless an eloquent and charming conversationalist ; and she involuntarily pays homage to genius, when she cour teously greets him with the words : \" With a common enemy, with a man who had sworn to destroy monarchy, without appreciating its utility among a great people, I should at this moment be guilty of a most ill-advised step ; but in speaking to a Mirabeau, it is not so.\" Gratified by her condescending graciousness, and at the same time confident of his own powers of genius, Mirabeau so employed his irresistible eloquence that Marie Antoinette began to hope that perchance this powerful mind might yet save the king. At the close"], [273, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 221 of the interview, Mirabeau, with daring yet respectful gallantry, said: \"Madame, when your august mother admitted one of her subjects to the honor of her presence, she never dismissed him without allowing him to kiss her hand.\" The queen held forth her beautiful hand, so fair and shapely ; and .Mirabeau, lightly touching it with his lips, exclaimed, as he withdrew, \" Madame, the mon archy is saved ! \" \" France in 1789 felt the impulse of liberty ; in 1790 she felt the unity of patriotism.\" The confederations removed all obstacles, and for a time all divisions of class, party, and religion were forgotten. \" The confed erations of November break up the provincial states ; those of January put an end to the struggle of the par liaments ; those of February put down the riots and pillages ; in March and April those masses are organized which stifle in May and June the first sparks of a war of religion : May, moreover, witnesses the military con federations, the soldier becoming once more a citizen, and the sword of the counter-revolution, its last weapon, shattered to pieces. What remains ? Fraternity has removed every obstacle, all the confederations are about to confederate together, and union tends to unity. No more confederations ! They are useless : only one now is necessary, \u2014 France ; and it appears transfigured in the glory of July.\" 1 Most of the confederations have themselves related their history. These festivals of rejoicing in the various provinces were marked by interesting incidents. At Saint- Jean-du-Gard the Catholic curate and Protestant minister embraced at the altar. In many of the processions an old man was placed at the head of the people, surrounded by a band of young girls dressed in white, with tri- 1 Michelet,"], [274, "222 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. colored sashes ; elsewhere the entire multitudes rushed into each other's arms, and joining hands formed an immense farandole, or provincial dance, while wine flowed in the streets ; tables were spread, provisions were pro vided for all, and in the evening the people solemnized this love-feast by praising God. In the civic procession of ' Romans ' in Dauphins, a beautiful girl headed the band, bearing in her hand a palm with this inscription : \" To the best citizen ! \" In the rural communes near Savoy there were battalions of children and maidens and women, all armed. They filed along in good order, headed by a banner, and the maidens handled their naked swords with that peculiar grace belonging to French women. In other communes symbols of unity were pre sented in marriages celebrated at the altar of the coun try, baptisms of children, or the adoption of children by the communes. At Saint-Maurice the law and the decrees of the Assembly were placed upon a map of the world, which covered the altar ; and a sword, plough, and scales were laid between two cannon-balls of the Bastile. At Lous-le-Saulnier they drank to \"All men, even our enemies, whom we swear to love and defend ! \" Michelet says: \"These memorials of rural communes are so many wild-flowers that seem to have sprung up in the midst of the harvest. These enthusiastic documents addressed to the country (represented by the Assembly) are love-letters ! There is nothing official or constrained ; it is evidently the language of the heart. The material details likewise gave them much solicitude : no writing seemed handsome enough, no paper elegant enough, not to mention the sumptuous little tri-colored ribbons to tie the papers with. When I saw them first, still gay, and but little faded, they reminded me of what Rousseau says of the extraordinary care he took to write, embellish,"], [275, "223 THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. and adorn the manuscript of his ' Julia.' Such was also the care and solicitude of our fathers, when, from tran sient and imperfect objects, their love aspired to eternal beauty. Where, then, are the old distinctions of prov inces and races of men ? All have disappeared ; geog raphy itself is annihilated. There are no longer any mountains, rivers, or barriers between men. Everything has gravitated towards one point, and that point now speaks forth : it is a unanimous prayer from the heart of France. In reading these memorials we seem to inhale the strong and vivifying perfume of the country at that glowing season of fecundity. It is like walking among the ripe corn. And in fact it was in the open country that all this took place. No temple would have sufficed. The whole population went forth, every man, woman, and child, and with them they transported the old in their chairs and infants in their cradles, whilst villages and whole towns were left in the custody of public faith. Any one who, on the 14th of July, 1790, had passed through those deserted villages at noon, without seeing the country, would have taken them for Herculaneum and Pompeii. Nobody was able to absent himself from the festival, for no one was a mere spectator : all were actors, from the centenarian to the new-born infant, and the latter more than any. He was carried like a living flower among the flowers of the harvest, offered by his mother, and laid upon the altar. \"That child upon the altar is France, with all the world surrounding her. In her, the common child of nations, they all feel themselves united, and all partici pating heartily in her future destiny, are anxiously pray ing around her, full of fear and hope. Not one of them beholds her without weeping. How Italy wept ! and Poland ! and Ireland ! (Ah, sister sufferers, remember"], [276, "224 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. that day forever ! ) Every oppressed nation, unmindful of its slavery, at the sight of infant liberty, exclaimed, ' In thee I am free ! ' In presence of that miracle, Ger many remained lost in thought, - \u2014 in an ecstatic revery. Klopstock was at prayers ; and the author of ' Faust,' unable any longer to maintain the part of sceptical irony, found himself on the point of being converted to faith. \" In a remote region of the northern seas there then existed an extraordinary, powerful creature, a man, or rather, a system, a living monument of scholastic science, callous and impenetrable, \u2014 a rock formed by adamant in the granite of the Baltic, \u2014 on which every religion, every system of philosophy, had struck and been shipwrecked, in his estimation. He alone remained immutable, and invulnerable to the outward world. His name was Em manuel Kant, but he called himself Critic. For sixty years this perfectly abstract being, devoid of all human connection, had gone out at precisely the same hour, and, without speaking to anybody, had taken precisely the same walk for a stated number of minutes ; just as we see in the old town clocks, a man of iron come forth, strike the hour, and withdraw. Wonderful to relate, the inhabitants of Konigsberg (who considered this an omen of the most extraordinary events) saw this planet swerve and depart from its long habitual course. They followed him, and saw him hastening towards the west, to the road by which they expected the courier from France. 0 humanity ! To behold Kant, moved and anxious, going forth on the road, like a woman, to inquire the news, was not that a surprising and wonderful change ? Why, no ; no change at all. That expansive intellect was following its course. What he had, till then, in vain sought for in science, Spiritual Unity, he now beheld forming itself by the heart and instinct.\""], [277, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 225 Thus, every nation was breathlessly watching France ; and in France every road was thronged with crowds pressing on to Paris, where was to be enacted that sub lime Festival of Federation, on the Field of Mars. As the bands of patriots tramped through the towns and villages, they chanted the \" Qa Ira ! \" This \" \u00a3a Ira \" of 1790 was very different from the murderous \" Qa Ira \" of 1793. The original song was a kind of hymn, and is thus translated : \" In these days the people are forever repeating, Come, this goes bravely, according to the precepts of the gospel. The law of the Great Legislator will now be fulfilled ; he that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" These lines were afterwards abridged and changed into a rondo of fury and madness, and became the rallying cry of the fanatics in the Reign of Terror. But now, chanted in all their primitive pathos, the notes of brotherly love resound from hill to hill, until France is girdled with the entrancing melody of good will and unity ; and the chorus grows richer and fuller, until it culminates in a rapturous anthem ascending into the summer sky from the busy Field of Mars, where a nation is engaged in preparing for a national festival of Fra ternity and Federation. The Field of Mars was originally a level plain. The celebration was to be observed on the 14th of July, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastile. The entire plain was to be terraced on all sides, forming a vast, grassy amphitheatre, in the centre of which the great altar was to be erected. There are but fifteen days left. The hired spademen seem to work lazily, suggestive of aristocratic bribes. But in spite of bribes and plotting aristocrats, the work shall be finished.

Each such willing worker is worth three mercenary ones ; and, as the twilight thickens, encourag ing shouts resound on all sides. The next day, an en thusiastic people will not wait until the hired workmen have left their tools free : spades and shovels can be found elsewhere. In this work, not even women or children will be left behind. From all sides of Paris stream forth men and women with spades on shoulders. Bands of white-robed young girls, sashed with tri-color, wave aloft green boughs, if they fail to find a spade ; ajid delighted boys trundle barrows ; and even little children may hand the glass of wine or water to the heated workers. All ranks and classes are there. Abb6 Sieyes is seen side by side with the Vicomte Beauharnais. Titled lady, whose fair fingers had, till then, touched nothing rougher than an embroidery frame, now grasp the hard-handled shovel, and bend courageously to the task by the side of the sad-faced nun, so recently re leased by Assembly edict from her voluntary or imposed seclusion. The neighboring villages turn out. The men come marching to village fiddle, and headed by be-spaded mayor. It is estimated that two hundred and fifty thousand workers are in that Field of Mars ; and \" no mercenary mock-workers, but real ones that lie freely to it ; each patriot stretches himself against the stubborn glebe, hews and wheels with the whole weight that is in him.

A certain person (of some quality, or private capital, to appearance), entering hastily, flings down his coat, waistcoat, and two watches, and is rushing to the thick of the work. 'But your watches ? ' cries the general voice. ' Does one distrust brothers ? ' answers he. Nor were the watches stolen. \"How beautiful is noble sentiment, like gossamer gauze, beautiful and cheap, which will stand no tear and wear ! Beautiful cheap gossamer gauze, thou film shadow of a raw-material of Virtue, which art not woven, nor likely to be, into Duty, thou art better than nothing, and also worse ! \"Young boarding-school boys, college students, shout ' Vive la Nation !

Everything is in readiness ; for the many willing workers have not relaxed their efforts till all is accomplished, and the Field of Mars is gayly adorned for this momentous festival. \"The morning seems cold, for a July one; but such festivity would make Greenland smile.\" But alas, it rains ! \" The weather is aristocratical,\" say the good natured people, who take their places nevertheless, \u2014 many even having camped upon the field the night before, that so they might be sure of witnessing from favorable standpoint this august ceremony. In the cen tre of the Field of Mars rises the altar of the nation ; and far aloft over this altar swing urns of incense, filling the air with delicate perfume, which floats away to mingle with the fragrance of the summer flowers. The immense green amphitheatre, with its many-seated slopes, rises on all sides, and its grassy hillocks are quickly covered by four hundred thousand waiting people, gayly attired in holiday dress, and adorned with tri-color streamers and cockades. There are triumphal arches, and a canopied throne for king and queen, draped with violet velvet, sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis. The vast eminences of Chaillot and Passy are also crowded with spectators, and, in the distance, the Field of Mars, encircled by Montmartre, Saint Cloud, Meu don, and Sevres, form altogether a magnificent amphi theatre, which seems made to receive the states-general of the world. At seven o'clock in the morning the procession of electors, representatives of corporations, presidents of dis-"], [283, "229 THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. tricts, members of the National Assembly, and Federates of the departments, escorted by the National Guard, set out in complete order from the site of the Bastile. This imposing procession traverses the city, and crosses the Seine over a bridge of boats, amidst a volley of artillery, and enters the Champ de Mars under a triumphal arch, which is adorned with patriotic inscriptions. The wait ing people have meanwhile set to dancing, to while away the tedious hours. The gay farandoles spread themselves in vast rings, in all directions, all classes and races mingling together. Brittany dances with Bur gundy, Flanders with the Pyrenees. \" We beheld those groups commencing their merry circles in the winter of '89 ; and the immense farandole which has gradually formed itself of the whole of France is now completed and ended at the Field of Mars. This is unity ! \" l Twelve hundred musicians fill the air with melodious music, \u2014 now, gay, dancing tunes ; then, stately martial chords ; and now, playing a low chant, \u2014 as four hundred white-robed priests, wearing tri-colored sashes, led by Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun, ascend the steps of the altar, and form themselves into groups, at the four corners of the platform. Behold, the king and queen arrive, and are seated under the royal canopy. La Fayette, on his white horse, pauses at the foot of the throne. The general alights, and, bending before the king with martial grace, receives his orders, and the written form of the oath. Silence for a moment, then forty pieces of cannon boom forth their thunderous tones. All the people rise, and stretch forth their hands to heaven. \"0 king! 0 people! Pause.

Pay attention to your oaths ! \" x Bishop Talleyrand now begins the mass. The choris ters intone their low chants, and the cannon mingles its solemn peals, which are echoed and re-echoed from hill-top to hill-top. Dark thunder-clouds have until now overshadowed the sky, and drenching showers of rain have fallen from time to time. But as the mass is concluded, and the bishop blesses the national banner of France, the oriflamme, and also the banners of the eighty three departments, the sun bursts from the black clouds, and streams forth in effulgent splendor, changing the quivering rain-drops on every leaflet to diamond-points and rainbow glories, while the majestic Te Deum is chanted by twelve hundred musicians. \" Sieur Motier, or Generalissimo La Fayette, \u2014 for they are one and the same, and he is General of France, in the king's stead, for four and twenty hours, \u2014 Sieur Motier must step forth, with that sublime chivalrous gait of his, solemnly ascend the steps of the Fatherland's altar, in sight of heaven, and of the scarcely breathing earth, and, under the creak of those swinging Cassolettes, ' pressing his sword's point firmly there,' pronounce the oath, To King, to Law, and Nation, in his own name, and that of armed France.

And yet this was not thoughtless levity; why should 1 Carlyle."], [286, "232 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. they not smile and rejoice upon the very spot where lay the ruins of their past oppression ? On that 14th day of July everything seemed possible. \"Every kind of dissension had ceased; there was no longer either nobility, citizens, or people ; the future was present. That is to say, time itself was no more. It was a flash of eternity.\" 1 France also possessed a marvel lous reserve force in her young men, who, in 1790, were twenty years of age or more. There had been an incredi ble production of power and genius. Two years (1768 and 1769) had produced Bonaparte, Hoche, Marceau, Joubert, Cuvier, Chateaubriand, and the two Fourriers. Saint-Martin, Saint-Simon, De Maistre, Bonald, and Madame de Stael, were born just before, and also Mehul, Lesueur, and the Cheniers ; and, a little later, Geoffroi- Saint-Hilaire, Bichat, Ampere, and Senancour. \"What a marvellous garland for Confederate France are these youths whom nobody has yet heard of ! Who would not be terrified on beholding on her brow those magnificent diamonds which are now sparkling in obscurity ! \" 1 But alas ! how soon dissensions, misunderstandings, and even bloodshed, occur in that France, where so lately all were swearing to defend each other. We will note three or four significant facts. On the 27th of July, the Assembly learned that the king had granted to the Aus trians a passage through the French territory, on their way to quell the revolution in Belgium. On the same day Europe made her first alliance against the Revolution. In the same month Mr. Pitt did not hesitate to say in open Parliament that he approved of every word of Edmund Burke's furious attack against the French Revolution, and France, which book, Michelet says, \"is wild with rage, full of calumny, scurrilous abuse, and 1 Michelet."], [287, "FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF THE GREAT FEDERATION."], [288, ""], [289, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 233 insulting buffoonery, in which the author compares the French to galley-slaves breaking their chains, treads under foot the Declaration of the Rights of Man, tears it in pieces, and spits upon it.\" For the author says: \"We Englishmen have not been emptied, sewed up, and stuffed like birds in a museum, with straw, or rags, or filthy paper-chippings, called the Rights of Man.\" In view of such words, no wonder Michelet exclaims : \" O sister nation ! nation of Newton and Shakespeare ! who would not feel pity in beholding you fallen into this base credulity, this cowardly defence of our common enemies \u2014 the aristocrats ? Long had England been working against France. Three men, eminently French, were, in the course of that century, caressed and gained over by that cunning England, so haughty in attitude, but so coaxing and base, as soon as ever her own interest in tervenes. She clutched Voltaire by her unprincipled Bolingbroke, by a semblance of religious liberty (whilst crushing Ireland). She ensnared Mirabeau, at first very adverse to her, by her Anglo-Genoese, who assisted him in his idleness and often wrote for him ; she had found him frightened between a deceased monarchy and an imminent republic, and offered him her spurious system as a plank in a shipwreck. But the most fatal seduction was that of Montesquieu. France, by the grand mis take of Louis XIV. (war with Holland) gave to England the supremacy of the seas; France, by the genius of Montesquieu, made for the English their famous constitu tional theory, which gave them authority in this world ; and France, once more, at the time of the Revolution gave them, ready-forged, those polemical weapons with which they attacked her. Our deserters went one after another to inspire and dictate to the English their argu ments against us. First Calonne, then Necker, then"], [290, "234 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Dumouriez ; but the man who injured France the most was Lally Tollendal. It was from him that Burke received the ready-made text. Those two men spoke, and everybody repeated their words. The defection of Lally and Mounier did us an incalculable harm through out Europe, which looked upon Mounier as the Rea son, the Minerva, of the Revolution. 'And even though they were a hundred thousand English more than they are, they should not gain the kingdom.' This vigor ous reply of the Maid of Orleans was uttered from the heart of France. She has never varied as to the eternal enemy. To which the French of the Revolution has very justly added the priest. Stop any man in the street, the most illiterate and ignorant, who knows little or nothing of the past, and ask him what at all times has caused the ruin of this country ; he will answer in his rough earnest language, ' The priests and the English.' \" Towards the end of 1790 there seemed for a moment an apparent lull in stirring events. People were aston ished and even alarmed at having no new reports or incidents. Camille Desmoulins, the witty journalist of sparkling genius, in despair at having nothing new to relate, between the acts of this Revolution drama, mar ries his faithful Lucile, and then notifies the world of this event in the columns of his paper. In the Palais Royal the eloquent and handsome AbM Fauchet is preaching. So great is his popularity that ladies pay large sums to obtain a chair when he is to speak. Women are not inactive in those stirring times. Not only do they storm the king at Versailles, but Madame Legros has caused the release of the imprisoned Latude ; Madame Palm Aelder, the orator of women, is preaching their emancipation ; Mademoiselle Keralio is publishing a news paper ; and presently Madame Roland will be a minister,"], [291, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 235 or even more. And Mademoiselle Theroigne, the hand some amazon of Liege \u2014 behold her, in her red silk riding habit, and armed with her large sabre of the 5th of Octo ber. She enters the Assembly of the Cordeliers, with the springing gait of the panther; she ascends the tribune, her countenance beaming with enthusiasm; while Desmoulins greets her with the exclamation, \" It is the Queen of Sheba, who has come to pay a visit to the Solomon of our district.\" \" If you are truly Solomons,\" replied Theroigne, \" you will prove it by building the Temple of Liberty, the palace of the National Assembly. And you will build it on the spot where the Bastile formerly stood.\" \" But who presides yonder in this Club of Cordeliers ? Surely, the King of Terrors himself ! \" Michelet says : \" What a frightful visage has that Danton ! Is this a cyclops or some goblin ? That large face, so awfully seared by the small-pox, with its small dull eyes, looks like a brooding volcano. No, that is not a man, but the very element of confusion, swayed by madness, fury, and fatality. Awful genius, thou frightenest me ! Art thou to save or ruin France?

What we read here is obscurity, mad ness, fatality, and an utter ignorance of the future. And yet this monster is sublime. This face, almost without eyes, seems like a volcano without a crater, \u2014 a volcano of horrors, or of fire, \u2014 which, in its pent-up furnace, is brooding over the struggles of nature. How awful will be the eruption. In that hour, an enemy, frightened at his language, but doing justice even in death to the genius that blasted him, will describe him with these ever-memorable words : 'The Pluto of eloquence.' That face is like a nightmare from which one cannot escape, \u2014 a horrible, oppressive dream, which is ever recurring to the mind. We become mechanically attracted towards this visible struggle of opposite principles ; we sym pathize with the inward struggle which is not a warfare of the passions, but one of ideas, \u2014 the impotency of reconciling them, or annihilating one by the other. It is a devoted \u0152dipus, who, possessed with his own enigma, carries within his breast a terrible sphinx that will devour him. \" What ! is that Marat ? that livid creature in green clothes, with those yellow and prominent gray eyes ? It must surely belong to the batrachian genus, rather than to the human species. What marsh has produced this hideous creature ? And yet his eyes have rather a mild expression. Their brilliancy and transparency, and their strange, wandering manner, gazing on vacancy, would lead one to suppose that this must be some visionary, at once a quack and a dupe, pretending to second-sight ; a vain and especially credulous street-prophet, believing every thing, above all, his own lies, all the involuntary fictions into which he is incessantly impelled by a spirit of exaggeration.

The crescendo will be terri ble ; he must find out or invent, and shout from his cellar at least one miracle every day, and lead on his trembling subscribers through a series of treasons, discoveries, and alarms. First, he returns thanks to the Assembly. \"Next, his face begins to glow. He has a great, terri ble treason to unfold ! A new plot has been discovered ! See how happy he is to tremble and make others tremble. See how the conceited and credulous creature has become transfigured ; his yellow skin is shining with perspira tion. \" He speaks. ' La Fayette has ordered fifteen thou sand snuff-boxes, all ornamented with his likeness, to be made in the Faubourg Saint- Antoine. There is something suspicious in this. I entreat all good citizens who are able to procure any, to destroy them. I am sure that the secret of the great plot will be found in them. Louis XVI. is bitterly weeping over the follies which the Austrian [the queen] has caused him to commit. The queen has given away so many white cockades, that the price of white ribbon has risen three sous an ell.' This is a positive fact ; for he, Marat, has heard so from one of the maids of La Bertin (the queen's milliner). Some persons laugh; others think that the matter ought to be inquired into ; that it is worth while. Marat con tinues, with a frown : ' I said three months ago, that there were six hundred guilty persons, and that six hun dred ropes would settle the business. What an error! We cannot manage now with less than twenty thousand.' Thunders of applause ! Camille Desmoulins, who re spected gods as little as kings, would occasionally laugh at the idol Marat, as much as at the idol La Fayette. Without remarking Marat's fury at any kind of inter ruption, he thus familiarly apostrophized the prophet :"], [294, "238 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.

Come, tell us seriously, are these nineteen thousand four hundred heads that thou addest, by way of amplification, to the six hundred of the other day, \u2014 are they really indispensable ? Wilt thou not bate one ? We must not do extravagantly what may be done economically. I should have thought that three or four plumed heads, rolling at the feet of Liberty, would have sufficed for the catastrophe of the drama.' \" 1 Thus fared it at the Cordeliers in 1790. Robespierre said at that time, in speaking of the Cordelier Camille Desmoulins and other Cordeliers, \" They are going too fast ; they will break their necks ; Paris was not made in a day ; and it requires more than a day to unmake it.\" But erelong Robespierre himself would be going much faster than any of these, and would unmake poor Paris at a more terrible rate than any before him. On the 28th of February, 1791, the populace, insti gated, it is said, by the Duke of Orleans, attacked the Castle of Vincennes, which at the time was used as a prison, as the prisons of Paris were overcrowded. This attack was led by Santerre, a brewer in the Faubourg Saint- Antoine. La Fayette being informed of this out burst, quickly repaired thither, and succeeded in restor ing order and dispersing the mob. Meanwhile it was rumored that an attack was to be made on the Tuileries. Accordingly several hundred of the dependents of the palace armed themselves with concealed weapons, hunt- 1 Michelet."], [295, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 239 ing-knives, and daggers, and gathered at the Tuileries. This unusual concourse of nobles astonished the National Guard, on duty there ; and thinking that it was some treasonable plot, they disarmed the courtiers, and mal treated some of them in the struggle. La Fayette arriv ing, caused the palace to be cleared, and the weapons to be seized. The nobles asserted that they had come to defend the person of the king, who had been threatened. But they were accused of having intended to carry him off. This was the famous \" Day of the Daggers.\" Emigration daily increased. Monsieur, the king's brother, was reported making preparations for flight. The populace surrounded his palace, demanded his pres ence ; and having appeared upon the balcony, he assured them that he had no intention of emigration ; in short, that he would never emigrate, which promise he after wards broke at the first favorable opportunity. The king's aunts decided to leave France and go to Rome. They had proceeded as far as Arnay-le-Duc, when their carriage was stopped, and they were arrested. Whereupon they wrote to the king, and he applied to the Assembly for an order allowing them to continue their journey unmolested. This question assumed quite an importance in the heated discussions of the Assem bly. It was reported that these two harmless ladies were transporting millions of francs, and were carrying off the dauphin, and preparing the way for the future flight of the king. The question was settled in the As sembly by a sarcastic exclamation of Menou. \"All Europe,\" said he, \"will be astonished to learn that a great Assembly has spent several days in decid ing whether two old ladies shall hear mass at Paris or Rome.\" This keen sally put an end to the discussion, and the"], [296, "240 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. princesses were allowed to continue their travels without further interruption. The \" Chronique de Paris,\" a newspaper written under the influence of the constitutional party, contained the following article on the departure of the mesdames. \u2014 \"Two princesses, sedentary from condition, age, and choice, find themselves, all on a sudden, seized with a mania for travelling, and running all over the world. \u2014 ' Tis odd, but 'tis possible. They are going, it is said, to kiss the Pope's toe. \u2014 Comical, but edifying. \" Thirty-two sections, and all good citizens, interpose between them and Rome. \u2014 That's of course. \"Mesdames, and particularly Madame Adelaide, wish to enjoy the rights of man. \u2014 ' Tis natural. \" They do not go, say they, with intentions hostile to the Revolution. \u2014 Possible, but doubtful. \" These fair travellers take eighty persons in their suite. \u2014 ' Tis pretty. But they carry off twelve millions. \u2014 Very ugly. \" They want change of air. \u2014 That's common enough. But their removal makes their creditors uneasy. \u2014 That's common enough also. \" They burn to travel (a maid's desire is a consuming fire). \u2014 Of course. Others burn to stop them. \u2014 Of course too. \" Mesdames insist that they are free to go wherever they please. \u2014 'Tis true.\" One evening, in March, 1790, the king was playing at whist with the queen, Monsieur, and Madame. M. Campan, who was by his office allowed admittance into the royal apartments, entered, and said to the queen that he had been commissioned by the Count d'lnisdal, to in form their majesties that a portion of the National Guard had been gained over ; that relays of horses had"], [297, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 241 been furnished by good royalists, at suitable distances, and that a party of nobles were then assembled prepared to carry the king off that very night. When this impor tant communication was made known, there was silence for a moment, all waiting for the king to express his opinion regarding such a proposition. But Louis re mained speechless, and continued the game. Marie An toinette thereupon said to him, \" Do you hear, sir, what Campan says to us ? \" \" Yes, I hear,\" replied the king, continuing to play. Monsieur desiring to force the king to answer, said to M. Campan, in a playful manner : \u2014 \"M. Campan, that pretty little couplet again, if you please.\" At length the queen said, \"But something must be said to Campan.\" Whereupon Louis XVL, addressing M. Campan, re marked, \" Tell 31. d'lnisdal that I cannot consent to be carried off!\" And the queen added, to enforce this answer, \" You understand, the king cannot consent to be carried off.\" This communication being reported to Count d'lnisdal, he said : \" I understand ; he wishes to throw all the blame, beforehand, upon those who are to devote themselves for him.\" Madam Campan says, in her Memoirs: \"The queen remained alone with me till midnight, preparing her cases of valuables, and ordered me not to go to bed. She imagined the king's answer would be understood as a tacit consent, and merely a refusal to participate in the design. I do not know what passed in the king's apart ments during the night ; but I occasionally looked at his windows ; I saw the garden clear ; I heard no noise in the palace, and day at length confirmed my opinion that the project had been given up."], [298, "242 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \"< We must, however, fly,' said the queen to me, shortly afterwards. ' Who knows how far the factions may go? The danger increases every day.' \" Poor Louis and Marie Antoinette were subject to con stant alarms. The affrighted little dauphin was not the only anxious one in that royal household, though the fol lowing incident regarding him is very pathetic. The day after the royal family had been brought by the populace from Versailles to the dismantled palace of the Tuileries, the dauphin, hearing some noise in the gardens, threw himself into the arms of the queen, crying out, with tears and terror : \u2014 \" Good God, mamma ! is to-day yesterday again ? \" No wonder the poor little prince was alarmed at the thought of that awful yesterday. A few days after this touching exclamation he went pensively to the king, and looked his father very tenderly in the face, with a seem ing questioning air. The king asked him what he wished. The dauphin answered with mature gravity that he had something very serious to say to him. \" What is it, my child ? \" inquired the king. \" Why is it, papa, that the people, who used to love you so well, are now so angry with you ? What have you done to irritate them so much ? \" His father took him tenderly and placed him on his knee, saying in kind tones : \" My dear child, I wished to render the people still happier than they were ; I wanted money to pay the expenses occasioned by wars. I asked my people for money, as my predecessors have always done ; magistrates, composing the Parliament, opposed it, and said that my people alone had a right to consent to it. I assembled the principal inhabitants of every town, whether distinguished by birth, fortune, or talents, at Versailles ; that is what is called the States-General."], [299, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 243 When they were assembled, they required concessions from me which I could not make, either with due respect to myself, or with justice to you, who will be my successor ; and wicked men, inducing the people to rise, have occasioned the excesses of the last few days : the people must not be blamed for them.\" The obedient little prince took great pains to treat all the officers and officials about him with proper affability; and would often go up to his mother after he had answered oblig ingly some mayor or member of the commune, and whis per in the queen's ear, \" Was that right, mamma?\" Poor baby prince ! he would so soon have the terrible question to ask, and never get it answered. \" Why are the people so angry with me ? What have I done to them ? \" But the dauphin was not the only anxious one. As it was apprehended that the disaffected might endeavor to carry the king off by force, M. de La Fayette promised Louis that he would give him warning by a discharge of a cannon from Henri IV.'s battery upon the Pont Neuf. One night some muskets were fired from the terrace of the Tuileries. The king, deceived by the noise, ran to the queen's apartments, in alarm. Not finding her there, he rushed to the room of the dauphin, where he found the queen holding her son in her arms. \" Madame,\" said Louis, \" I have been seeking you ; I was uneasy about you.\" Marie Antoinette, lifting the dauphin towards him, answered with brave composure : \u2014 \" I was at my station.\" Well had Mirabeau observed, \" She is the only man whom his majesty has about him.\" Another says : \" She has courage for all noble daring : an eye and a heart; the soul of Theresa's daughter. ' Faut-il done ' [is it fated then], she passionately writes"], [300, "244 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to her brother, ' that I, with the blood I am come of, with the sentiments I have, must live and die among such mortals ? '\" l Alas, poor unfortunate queen ! You shall live and die among yet more terrible mortals. The proud daughter of the C\u00e6sars must erelong bow her noble head beneath the barbarous knife of very demons in human shape, and her brave heart must be lacerated by all the pangs of anguish which mortal woman is capable of enduring; yes, more awful sorrows than other women could endure ; and yet the heroic heart never breaks, the noble head is never lowered in weak despair, and the walk to the guillotine is as stately and queenly as her regal bearing in the magnificent salons of Versailles. Ah, poor Marie Antoinette ! as we gaze upon you there in all your loveliness, caressing with motherly tenderness the golden-haired, angel-faced dauphin, and looking up wards towards your husband, the king, with all the proud love of a mother, all the fond devotion of a wife, what a picture of horror rises before us as we catch a glimpse of the direful future ! \" Gradually, after the rage of the people was appeased, the excessive vigilance which had surrounded the royal family was relaxed. They were permitted to leave the interior of the palace and go down into the gardens ; and there were even some weeks and months when it appeared as if the exasperated spirits would be pacified, and the throne would be re-established with a portion of its old dignity.\" The king had, in a certain manner, received forgiveness from the National Assembly, and had ac cepted the constitution. The people seemed grateful to him for this, and appeared willing to resume more ami cable relations. The queen was no longer insulted with 1 Carlyle."], [301, "THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. 245 contemptuous cries when she appeared in the Tuileries Gardens, or in the Bois de Boulogne ; and it even became fashionable to speak of the dauphin as a miracle of love liness, and to go to the Tuileries to see him working in his little garden. This garden of the dauphin was in the immediate vicinity of the palace, at the end of the terrace on the river-side ; it was surrounded by a high fence, and near by stood the little pavilion of the Abbe Davout, teacher of the dauphin. The dauphin had had at Versailles a little garden of his own, which he himself worked and planted, and from whose flowers he every morning picked a bouquet, to bring, with beaming countenance, to his \"mamma queen.\" For this painfully missed garden of Versailles, the lit tle garden on the Tuileries terrace had to compensate. The dauphin was delighted with it ; and every morning, when his study hours were over, he hastened to his little par terre to dig up the weeds, and to water his flowers. The garden has since that day been greatly changed ; it has been enlarged, laid out on a different plan, and surrounded with a higher fence : but it still remains the garden of the lit tle Dauphin Louis Charles, the same garden that Napo leon gave subsequently to the king of Rome ; the same that Charles X. gave to the Duke de Bordeaux ; the same that Louis Philippe gave to the Comte de Paris. How many recollections cluster around this little bit of earth, which has always been left prematurely by its young possessors ! One died in prison, scarcely ten years old; two, cast out by the storms of revolutions, ended their days in foreign lands ; and the fourth, exiled from France, wanders through Europe. But sad and strange as have been the fates of these children, the fates of their fathers have been still more so."], [302, "246 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" One died upon the scaffold ; another, by the knife of an assassin ; a third, from a fall upon the pavement of a highway; and the last, the greatest of them all, was bound like Prometheus to a rock, and fed on bitter recol lections till he met his death.\" The Revolution had for a time seemed quieted and ap peased ; the royal family had been hailed with acclama tions ; and the Parisians appeared to have again become enthusiastic royalists. But this state of affairs did not last long. Marat, Robespierre, and Danton rested not, and strove by every means within their power to excite the fury of the people. \" Down with the Austrian she wolf ! \" yelled Marat from the tribune of his club. \" Down with the royalists ! \" thundered Robespierre. And now the storm-birds gathered round the Tuileries, and through the iron railings of the little dauphin's garden threatening words were often heard and spiteful faces seen. One day, when little Louis Charles heard such words and saw such faces, he shrank back, and, running to his mother, earnestly implored her to leave the garden, and go with him into the palace. \" Come then, my son, since you wish it,\" said the queen, and she started towards the palace. Their way lay along the Arcadia Walk, behind whose railings the people were crowded in a dense mass, and all their blazing eyes were fixed upon the queen, and words of hate and threatening followed her every step. \" See, see ! \" cried a woman with dishevelled hair, which streamed out from her round cap, and fell over her red, angry face ; \" see, that is the baker's wife, and the monkey that jumps before her is the baker's boy !

Times will be different by and by, and we shall see the baker's wife as hungry as we. But when we have the bread, we will give her none, \u2014 no, we will give her none ! \" \"No, indeed; we will give her none ! \" roared the mob. And they all pressed closer to the fence; and naked arms and clenched fists, thrust through the palings, threatened the queen, and the dauphin who walked in front of his mother. As they neared a part of the path which ran close to the fence, the queen saw the bare arm of a man, which extended as far as possible through the railing, stretched half-way across the walk. The queen looked in alarm toward the dauphin. She saw him hesitate a little in his hurried course, and then go slowly forward. \"Come here, my son,\" said Marie Antoinette; \"give me your hand.\" But before she could reach him, the little prince sprang forward and stood in front of the outstretched arm. \" Good day, sir ! \" he said in a loud voice ; \" good day ! \" And he grasped the great hand of the man and shook it a little, as in friendly salutation. \" What do you mean ? \" roared the man ; \" and how dare you lay your paw on the claws of the lion ? \" \" I thought you were stretching out your hand to reach me,\" said the dauphin ; \" and so I give you mine, and say, ' Good day, sir ! ' \" \" And, if I wanted, I could crush your hand in my fist as if it were in a vice,\" said the man, holding the little hand firmly. \"You shall not do it ! \" cried the crowd. \"No, Simon; you shall not hurt the child.\" \" Sir ! \" exclaimed the queen, motioning back with a commanding gesture the two lackeys who were hasten-"], [304, "248 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ing to release the dauphin, \"sir, I beg you to withdraw your hand, and not to hinder us in our walk.\" \" Ah ! you are there too, are you, madame the baker's wife ? \" cried the man, with a horrid laugh. \" But sup pose I do not do as you want me to ? I suppose you would dictate to me then, and perhaps call your soldiers and order them to shoot the dreadful people ? \" \" You know, Master Simon, that I give no such com mand, and never gave any such,\" replied the queen. \" The king and I love our people, and never would order our soldiers to fire upon them.\" \"Because you would not be sure, madame, that the soldiers would obey your commands if you should,\" laughed Simon. \" Since we got rid of the Swiss guards, there are no soldiers left who would let themselves be torn in pieces for their king and queen ; and you know well that if the soldiers should fire the first shot at us, the people would tear the soldiers in pieces afterward. Yes, yes, the fine old days at Versailles are past. Here, in Paris, you must accustom yourself to ask, instead of command ; and the arm of a single man of the peo ple is enough to stop the queen and the dauphin of France.\" \" You are mistaken, sir ! \" exclaimed Marie Antoinette. \" The queen and the dauphin of France will no longer be detained by you in their walk.\" And, with a quick movement, she caught the dauphin, struck back the fist of the cobbler, and, snatching the boy away with the rapidity of lightning, passed by before Simon could again extend his arm. The people, delighted with this energetic and coura geous action of the queen, \u2014 the people, who would have howled with rage had she ordered her lackeys to push the cobbler back, \u2014 now roared with admiration to see the"], [305, "249 THE FESTIVAL OF THE FEDERATION. proud-hearted woman have the courage to repel her assailant, and free herself from him.

And now I solemnly swear, if a law against emigration is voted, I swear to disobey you.\" Mirabeau never displayed more power to sway and overawe the Assembly than on this occasion ; but it was almost his last effort. \" Mirabeau desired to save two things, \u2014 royalty and liberty; believing royalty itself to be a guarantee for lib erty.\" He had declared to the queen at the time of their meeting at Saint Cloud: \"Madame, the monarchy is saved ! \" And, conscious of his own genius and marvellous power, he truly thought that in him lay the salvation of royalty ; and, feeling this, he consented to receive money from the court, excusing himself on the plea, \"that he not had been bought : that he was paid, not sold.\" But the weakness of this plea is apparent, and, though Mirabeau was probably not guilty of treason, as some affirm, he was undoubtedly guilty of corruption. And still there was some truth in his affirmation that he was not bought ; for, not withstanding his negotiations with the court, he contin ued frankly to avow his principles of freedom ; and, when the interests of court and liberty clashed, he was bold enough to use his eloquence in defence of that liberty, which, in spite of all his faults, all his sins, he died serving. His genius swayed France ; and Camille Des moulins expressed the general verdict when he exclaimed in enthusiastic admiration, after one of Mirabeau's great"], [308, "252 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. speeches, as he warmly greeted the eloquent orator, \" If the court has not given you a hundred thousand crowns for your speech of to-day, it is certainly robbing you ! \" The character and life of Mirabeau form a strange enigma, which history fails to explain, \u2014 so great, and yet so weak ! so wicked, and yet so noble ! H. Morse Stevens, in his recent \" History of the French Revolution,\" says : \"It can never be too strongly asserted that Mirabeau was no Alcibiades, proud of his immorali ties and his sins, but a man who repented bitterly when he perceived how greatly his evil deeds had injured his chance of doing France good service. The great moral to be derived from the life of the great statesman and orator is, that immorality of life will affect success in politics, as in everything else, \u2014 a truth which no career ever illustrated better than that of Honors Gabriel Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau.\" If this \"gigantic heathen\" Mirabeau could have ac complished so much, who can estimate the transcendent good which might have been achieved by an honest, Christian Mirabeau ? Such is the lesson to be gathered from the history of this remarkable man. \" One can say that had Mirabeau lived, the history of France and of the world had been different. Further, that the man would have needed, as few men ever did, the whole compass of that same ' Art of Daring ' [Art d'Oser] which he so prized, and likewise that he, above all men then living, would have practised and manifested it.

Had Mirabeau lived one other year ! \" ' \" If I had not lived with him,\" says Dumont, \" I never should have known what a man can make of one day ; what things may be placed within the interval of twelve hours. A day for this man was more than a week or a month is for others ; the mass of things he guided on together was prodigious ; from the scheming to the exe cuting not a moment was lost. 'Monsieur le Comte,' said his secretary to him once, ' what you require is im possible.' ' Impossible ! ' answered he, starting from his chair. ' Ne me dites jamais ce Mte de mot ! ' [\"Never name to me that blockhead of a word !\"].\" In January, 1791, Mirabeau still sat in his place as president of the Assembly, though his end was visibly drawing near. \"At parting he embraced me,\" says Dumont, \"with an emotion I had never seen in him. 1 1 am dying, my friend, dying as by slow fire ; we shall perhaps not meet again. When I am gone, they will know what the value of me was. The miseries I have held back will burst from all sides on France.' \" Prophetic words quickly fulfilled. On the 28th day of March he ascended the tribune for the last time. Five times he speaks that day in behalf of interests in which a friend's fortune is involved. Death is already clutching him ; and as he descends from the tribune, he is utterly exhausted, and gasps to the friend near him, \" Take me out of this ! \" The next day Paris was alarmed by the report that Mirabeau was dying. All men, even his adversaries, spoke now only of love and admiration. For he had been courteous even to his enemies, as the following incident will prove. On one occasion he was reading a i Carlyle."], [310, "254 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. report to the Assembly regarding some riots in Mar seilles, which he affirmed were fomented by the parti sans of the court. He was incessantly interrupted by some of the aristocrats, who abusively applied to him the epithets of \"calumniator, liar, assassin, scoundrel,\" and the like. Pausing for a moment in his reading, he gazed upon his denouncers with an imperturbable smile, and in his most winning and persuasive tones he said, \" Gentlemen, I wait till these amenities be exhausted.\" But now the great Mirabeau lies upon his death-bed ; never again will those thunder tones of eloquence or melt ing tones of persuasion greet the ears of friends or foes. Crowds throng around the sick man's door. The king sends daily to inquire concerning him ; the Jacobins send a deputation. He would have no other physician than his friend Cabanis, and would see no other priest but Talley rand, Bishop of Autun, whom he sent for, and put into his hands a speech he had just written. \" It will be curious,\" said he, \" to hear a man speaking against wills who is no more, and who has just made his own.\" The court had, in fact, desired him to make his will, promis ing to pay all legacies ; and the speech he had prepared was about the right of making wills, to the laws concern ing which the Assembly was about to give attention. Mirabeau's greatest uneasiness in dying seemed to be the threatening attitude of England. \"That Pitt,\" said he, \" is governing with threats rather than with deeds ; I should have given him some trouble, if I had lived.\" \" On the morning of the 2d of April,\" says Cabanis, \"he ordered his windows to be opened, and said to me in a firm tone, ' Friend, I shall die to-day. On such a day it only remains to perfume one's self, and then, crowned with flowers and surrounded with music, to be"], [311, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 255 lulled agreeably to that sleep from which there is no waking.' He then called his valet-de-chambre : ' Come,' said he, ' prepare to shave me and to dress me carefully and completely.' He ordered his bed to be moved nearer an open window, in order that he might contemplate the first symptoms of vernal vegetation on the trees in his little garden. The sun was shining, and he exclaimed, ' If this be not God, it is at least his cousin-german.' Soon after, he lost the use of speech ; but he still replied by signs to the proofs of friendship which we showed him.\" How pitifully sad that such a soul could see no God, and looked only for everlasting sleep in the tomb ! His sufferings were intense, and with a look of agony he wrote upon his tablet the word \"sleep,\" and pointed with his dying hand towards the cup of opium which he desired to drink to end his anguish. Thus died the matchless Mirabeau. Great, and yet so pitiably weak ! without hope and without God, his gigan tic genius passed into the unknown. Flowers and per fumes and music might soothe his bodily pains, but what comfort was there for his immortal soul ? That soul, the hungry longings of which were increased by the very greatness of his genius ! Opium and then anni hilation were his only hopes. Titanic heathen! such was the product of a revolution which denied religion, ignored God, and placed the end of life in the grave. With Michelet we say : \" Let us not leave Mirabeau to sleep in the earth ; what we have seen buried at Sainte- Genevieve is the least part of him. His soul and his memory still remain, and must give an account to God and men.\" Lamartine says : \" After the death of Mirabeau, on the 2d of April, 1791, the instinct of the people led them to"], [312, "256 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. press around the house of his tribune, as if to demand inspiration even from his coffin ; but had Mirabeau been still living, he could no longer have given it ; his star had paled its fires before that of the Revolution ; hurried to the verge of an unavoidable precipice by the very chariot he himself had set in motion, it was in vain that he clung to the tribune. We pity genius when we be hold it struggling with impossibility. Mirabeau was the most potent man of his time ; but the greatest individ ual contending with an enraged element appears but a madman. A fall is majestic only when accompanied by virtue. \"Grand displays cast a veil of universal mourning over the secret sentiments which his death inspired in all parties. Whilst the various belfries tolled his knell and minute-guns were fired ; whilst, in a ceremony that had assembled four hundred thousand spectators, they awarded to a citizen the funeral obsequies of a monarch ; whilst the Pantheon, to which they conveyed his remains, seemed scarcely a monument worthy of such ashes, \u2014 what was passing in the depths of men's hearts ? \" The king, who held Mirabeau's eloquence in pay ; the queen, with whom he had nocturnal conferences, regretted him, perhaps, as the last means of safety ; yet still he inspired them with more terror than confidence, and the humiliation of a crowned head demanding succor from a subject must have felt comforted at the removal of that destroying power which itself fell before the throne did. The court was avenged by death for the affronts which it had undergone. He was to the nobil ity merely an apostate from his order. The climax of its shame must have been to be one day raised by him who had abased it. The National Assembly had grown weary of his superiority. There was no longer any rival, but"], [313, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 257 there were many envious. His eloquence, though popu lar in style, was that of a patrician. His democracy was delivered from a lofty position. His popular sentiments were in some sort but the liberality of his genius. The vast expansiveness of his mighty soul had no resemblance to the paltry impulses of demagogues. In acquiring rights for the people he seemed as though he bestowed them. He was a volunteer of democracy. He recalled, by his part and his bearing to those democrats behind him, that from the time of the Gracchi to his own the tribunes who most served the people had sprung from the ranks of the patricians. His talent, unequalled for philosophy of thought, for depth of reflection, and loftiness of expres sion, was another kind of aristocracy which could never be pardoned him. Nature placed him in the foremost rank, and death only created a space around him for secondary minds. They all endeavored to acquire his position, and all endeavored in vain. The tears they shed upon his coffin were hypocritical. The people only wept in all sincerity because the people were too strong to be jealous, and they, far from reproaching Mirabeau with his birth, loved in him that nobility as though it were a spoil they had carried off from the aristocracy. Moreover, the nation, disturbed at seeing its institutions crumbling away one by one, and dreading a total destruc tion, felt instinctively that the genius of a great man was the last stronghold left to them. This genius quenched, it saw only darkness and precipices before the monarchy. The Jacobins alone rejoiced loudly, for it was only he who could outweigh them.\" Carlyle says of Mirabeau : \" This singular Riquetti Mirabeau, a fiery rough figure, with black Samson-locks under the slouch-hat, he steps along.

And now it has got air; it will burn its whole substance, its whole smoke atmosphere too, and fill all France with flame. Strange lot ! Forty years of that smouldering, with foul fire damp and vapor enough ; then victory over that, \u2014 and like a burning mountain he blazes heaven-high ; and, for twenty-three resplendent months, pours out flame and molten fire-torrents, the Pharos and wonder-sign of an amazed Europe, \u2014 and then lies hollow, cold forever ! Pass on, thou questionable Gabriel Honore, the greatest of them all : in the whole National Deputies, in the whole nation, there is none like and none second to thee. \"And so, on the second day of April, 1791, the over wearied giant has fallen down, to die. The people stand mute, heart-stricken. His death is Titanic, as his life has been ! Lit up, for the last time, in the glare of coming dissolution, the mind of the man is all glowing and burning, utters itself in sayings such as men long remember. ' I carry in my heart the death-dirge of the French Monarchy ; the dead remains of it will now be the spoil of the factious.' So likewise, while some friend is supporting him : ' Yes, support that head ; would I could bequeath it thee ! ' For the man dies as he had lived, self-conscious, conscious of a world looking on. So dies a gigantic heathen and Titan, stumbling blindly, undismayed, down to his rest.\" On the 3d of April the National Assembly decreed that the Church of Sainte-Genevieve should be conse crated to the burial of great men, and converted into a Pantheon ; and that Mirabeau should be placed there by the side of Descartes, who was already buried there. Voltaire and Rousseau were also to be brought thither. On the 4th of April the funeral of Mirabeau took place. \" Not a shred of color is to be seen throughout the entire"], [315, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 259 capital. The Rue Chaussee d'Antin has been changed for the nonce into Rue Mirabeau the Patriot ; and before the house he inhabited, the proprietress, Julie Talma, has erected the bust of the ' French Demosthenes,' crowned with laurels. The celebrated Houdon has taken his cast. The ' friends of the Constitution ' go into mourning for four days. The Lyceum writes on the programme of its sittings, ' Men are requested to wear black, women white, for the death of Mirabeau.' Hundreds of Mirabeau's effigies are sold in wax. Death changes Mirabeau, like the primitive kings of Rome, into a deity.\" 1 Rumors were spread that he had been poisoned. The author of the \" Memoires d'un Pair de France \" positively asserts that Mirabeau was poisoned. He says \" that in 1793 Robespierre, at a moment when he was off his guard, ventured to boast of the share which he had taken in that crime. Two parties,\" he adds, \" were then labor- ing to accomplish the ruin of the king ; a third wished it without declaring itself ; all of them were concerned to see that Louis XVI. inclined to a cordial reconciliation with the constitution, and all dreaded the sound advice which Mirabeau had it in his power to give him. It was well known that this man was the only person capable of directing affairs in such a manner as to keep the factions within the limits which they hoped to pass. As the issue of any attempt to strip him of his popularity was uncertain, it was thought better to despatch him; but as no assassin was to be found, it was necessary to have recourse to poison. Marat furnished the receipt for it ; it was prepared under his superintendence, and he answered for its effect. How to administer it was the next question. At length it was resolved to choose the opportunity of a dinner, at which the poisonous ingre- 1 Henri Van Laun."], [316, "260 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. dients should be introduced into the bread, or wine, or certain dishes of which Mirabeau was known to be fond. Robespierre and Petion undertook to see to the execution of this atrocious scheme, and were assisted by Fabre d'Eglantine, and two or three other subordinate Orlean ists. Mirabeau had no suspicion of this perfidy ; but its effects were manifested immediately after a pleasure party, at which he had indulged in great intemperance. He was soon aware that he was poisoned, and told his intimate friends so, and especially Cabanis, to whom he said : ' You seek the cause of my death in my physical excesses ; you will find it rather in the hatred borne me by those who wish for the overthrow of France, or those who are afraid of my ascendancy over the minds of the king and queen.' It was impossible to drive it out of his head that his death was not natural, but great pains were taken to prevent this opinion from getting abroad.\" It is said that Mirabeau's son declared that the greater part of the surgeons who performed the autopsy \" found indubitable traces of poison,\" but from prudence they remained silent. \"On the 4th of April the funeral procession took place, the most extensive and popular that had ever been in the world, before that of Napoleon on the 15th of De cember, 1840. The people themselves managed the police, and admirably ; and no accident happened in that crowd of three or four hundred thousand men. The streets, boulevards, windows, roofs, and trees were all loaded with spectators. \" At the head of the procession walked La Fayette ; next, surrounded by the twelve huissiers d, la chaine, came Tronchet, the president of the National Assembly ; and after him the entire Assembly, without any distinc tion of party. Si6yes, Mirabeau's intimate friend, who"], [317, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 261 detested the Lameths, and never spoke to them, had nevertheless the noble and delicate idea of taking the arm of Charles de Lameth, thus sheltering them from the unjust suspicion that was impending. \"Immediately after the National Assembly marched, in a dense mass, the Club of the Jacobins, like a second Assembly, before all the authorities. They had distin guished themselves by a pompous display of grief, order ing mourning for eight days, and an eternal mourning to be repeated on every anniversary. \"This immense procession could not arrive at the Church Saint-Eustache before eight o'clock, where Ce rutti pronounced the funeral oration. Twenty thousand National Guards discharged their arms at once, and all the windows were shattered to atoms ; for a moment people thought that the church would fall in upon the coffin. Then the funeral procession resumed its course by torchlight. Two powerful instruments were then heard for the first time, the trombone and the tamtam. Those violent and detached notes overawed the soul and affected the heart. It was very late at night when the funeral cortege arrived at the Church of Saint-Genevieve, from that time known as the Pantheon.\" -1 In a little more than one short year, a very different scene was enacted at that same church. In the King's Iron Chest, discovered in the Tuileries, through the treachery of the locksmith with whom King Louis had worked at lock-making, certain papers were found which leaders of the Commune declared implicated Mirabeau in conspiracies with the court. \" It was on a dull day in autumn, in the tragical year 1794, \u2014 when France had almost finished exterminating herself ; it was then that, having killed the living, she set about destroying the 1 Michelet."], [318, "262 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. dead, and banished her most glorious son from her heart, performing this last act of grief with savage joy.\" 1 The agent of the law charged with one of the bar barous prods-verbal, by means of which so many atro cious deeds were brought about with a mockery of law, advanced towards the entrance door of the Pantheon, followed by a cortege de la site, and there read the decree which banished the remains of Honore Riquetti Mira beau from that place of honor, and commanded them to be placed in the common burial-place for executed crim inals, the cemetery of Clamart, in the Faubourg Saint- Marceau. The body was transferred thither during the night, and interred there with no sign to mark the spot ; and in 1848, when a writer describing the grave visited the enclosure, the remains of Mirabeau had lain in that convict burial-ground for more than fifty years. \" The parties who divided the country after the death of Mirabeau were thus distributed : out of the Assembly, the Court and the Jacobins ; in the Assembly, the Right Side and the Left Side ; and between these two extreme parties \u2014 the one fanatic by its innovations, the other fanatic from its resistance \u2014 there was an intermediate party consisting of the men of substance and peace belonging to both these parties. Their views moderate, and wavering between revolution and conservatism, they desired that the one should conquer without violence, and the other concede without vindictiveness. These were the philosophers of the Revolution. But it was not the hour for philosophy ; it was the hour of victory : the two ideas required champions, not judges ; they crushed men in their encounter.\" 2 Soon after the death of Mirabeau, a small, insignifi cant-appearing man called at the house of Alexandre de 1 Michelet. **\u25a0 Lamartine."], [319, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 263 Lameth at an early hour in the morning. Lameth was still in bed, and the gentleman was admitted to his apartment. This was M. de Montmorin, the minister for foreign affairs. \" The minister sits down by the bedside, and begins his confession. He speaks ill of Mirabeau (a sure way of pleasing the Lameths), reproaches himself for the evil course upon which he had entered, and the large sums he had spent in order to penetrate the secrets of the Jacobins. ' Every evening,' says he, ' I had the letters they had received from the provinces, and I read them to the king, who often admired the wisdom of your re plies.' The conclusion of this conversation was, that Lameth, in one respect, succeeded Mirabeau, and became what Barnave had been ever since the month of Decem ber, \u2014 one of the secret advisers of the court.\" l In June, 1791, Robespierre was elected public accuser for the Tribunal of the Seine, and begins to come more prominently into notice. The decree ordering that the clergy could be forced to take the oath of the constitu tion occasioned much excitement. The bishops gener ally refused to take the oath, and many hitherto patriot priests upheld the higher ecclesiastics, as they were in fluenced by the declaration of the bishops that this oath was an infringement upon their sacred office. Alarm bells were rung in different towns, and the people fought in the streets, at the doors of the churches. As Easter approached in the spring of 1791, the excitement became more intense. Patriotic mobs repaired to the churches where non-conformists had determined to take their Easter communion from the hand of non-conformist priests, and threatened to whip any person who should dare to enter the church. On the Quai des TMatins, in 1 Michelet."], [320, "264 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the most frequented part of Paris, a large crowd had col lected, vowing to punish the first person who should pre sent himself at the door of the church. Two women rashly came forward, and were brutally whipped by the mob. Two brooms were then suspended over the church door. The authorities were unable to disperse the mob, and the non-conformists were obliged to relinquish their plan of receiving their Easter communion. The churches were deserted, and the convents opened their chapels to crowds of counter-revolutionists, yesterday atheists, to day devotees, as the question had now assumed a politi cal aspect. These convents also boldly maintained their cloisters, notwithstanding the decrees abolishing all mon asteries and convents ; and many nuns, desirous of leav ing these institutions, where they had been placed against their wills, found themselves prevented from regaining their liberty even though the Assembly had decreed that they were free. The National Assembly received peti tions from mothers whose daughters were detained by force in the cloisters, and at the Convent of the Ladies of Saint Anthony, a young nun (s\u0153ur converse) having testified much delight at the decree which opened her cell, was thereupon exposed to cruel severity from the abbess of the convent, and the nuns who upheld that fanatical lady, and paid court to the abbess, who was of noble birth. The persecuted young nun having found means to give information of her sufferings, was rescued in a singular manner. She passed her head through the turning-box, and her friends, after much trouble, succeeded in dragging the remainder of her body through the small opening, and thus she was set at liberty. Women, indignant at such cruelties, repaired to the convents and boldly whipped the nuns ; and did not even"], [321, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 265 spare the non-conformist priests, but caned them with vigor, to the amusement of the surrounding crowd. Women were at once the victims and the instruments of the Reign of Terror. Non-conformist women thought they were serving God in upholding the rebellious priests, and patriot women thought they were serving their country in persecuting them. Everybody was watching anxiously to see whether the king would take the Easter communion with the friends or enemies of the Revolu tion. He had already dismissed the parish curate who had taken oath, and the Tuileries was full of non-con formist priests. In the summer of 1790, the conscience of the king being greatly troubled by the affair of the oath required of the clergy, he was persuaded by the non-conformists to write to different powers making his protestation. He first wrote to his cousin, the king of Spain, then to the emperor of Austria, and to Catherine of Russia, and the king of Sweden ; and in December he applied to the power which he suspected most, \u2014 Prussia. He de manded of all, \"a European congress, supported by a strong army,\" without explaining whether he desired this force to act against the Revolution. The powers made no haste to interfere. The North was in commotion. The revolution of Poland broke out that year ; Liege and Brabant had already been devoured ; and the turn of France would come. \"Kings,\" said Camille Desmoulins, \"having tasted the blood of na tions, will not easily cease. We know that the horses of Diomedes, after having once eaten human flesh, would eat nothing else.\" Catherine of Russia wrote to the queen : \" Kings must pursue their course, without caring for the outcries of the people, as the moon follows its course, without being"], [322, "266 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. impeded by the baying of dogs.\" Catherine meanwhile was agitating all Europe, and acting energetically with her pen and her tongue. \" If she were able, indeed, by the king's deliverance to let loose civil war, and afterwards set all the kings fight ing for prostrate France, how easy would it be for her, sitting in her charnel-house of the north, to drink the blood of Poland, and gnaw her to the bone. When the escape was attempted, it was the minister of Russia who undertook to get a passport for a Russian lady to be given to the queen. Catherine sent no succor; but she was well contented that Gustavus III., the petty king of Sweden (just beaten by her, and now her friend), a prince of a restless, romantic, chivalrous mind, should go in quest of adventures at Aix, at the very gate of France. There, under pretence of taking the waters, he was to wait for the beautiful queen absconding with her husband, to offer her his invincible sword, and, disinter estedly, teach the good-natured Louis XVI. how thrones may be restored.\"1 Austria, which had been an ally of France ever since the marriage of Louis XVI., was interested in the king's escape. But to lull jealous Prussia and jealous England, so that they would allow her to interfere, she desired it to appear that she was obliged, in spite of herself, to act for France. \" Civil war begun \" was the express condi tion that this ally made for her intervention. On the 15th of April, 1791, it is announced that his Majesty, who desired some change of air, would go to Saint Cloud, wishing to celebrate Easter there. Straightway there are many rumors afloat. It is reported that thirty thousand Chevaliers of the Daggers wait concealed in the surrounding forests, who will carry off the king. 1 Michelet."], [323, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 267 Also, the patriot people think it is not meet that the king should receive communion at the hands of refrac tory anti-constitutional priests at Saint Cloud. If he must be ministered to by non-conformist prelates, surely it were safer he should do so in Paris, under the eye of National Guards and keenly watchful patriots. Did Louis really intend to go to Saint Cloud? This is a question which history answers not plainly. Some say it was a feint, knowing that he would be restrained, and thereby his imprisonment might be manifest to foreign allies, who should in consequence espouse his cause with greater vehemence. Others, among them La Fayette himself, supposed this journey to be the king's desire; and La Fayette promised him safe escort, and was much chagrined that the suspicious crowds, in spite of all his efforts, prevented the contemjdated journey. About one o'clock, on the 18th of April, the royal car riage, harnessed to eight stately black steeds, is drawn up in the Place du Carrousal, awaiting its imperial owners. \" Is the king stolen then ? Is he gone ? \" cry the multitudes. \" Shall he be carried off before our very eyes ? No ! Never ! \" Men rush to the neighboring Church of Saint Roche, and clambering to the tower, strike the tocsin of alarm. La Fayette comes up with National Guard, with \"aides-de-camp and oratory.\" \" Taisez-vous,\" shout the crowds. \" We will brook not this thing! The king shall not go!\" \" Monsieur appears at an upper window ; ten thousand voices bray and shriek : ' Nous ne voulons pas que le Roi parte.' Their Majesties have mounted.

Will royalty fly off towards Austria like a lit rocket towards endless conflagration of civil war ? Stop it, ye patriots, in the name of Heaven ! Rude voices passionately apostrophize royalty itself. Usher Campan, and other like official persons pressing forward with help or advice, are clutched by the sashes, and hurled and whirled in a confused, perilous manner, so that her Majesty has to plead passionately from the carriage window.\"1 Their Majesties, advised by friends, and forced by foes, at length dismount and retire indignant. The king's Maison-de-Plaisance shall remain empty of roy alty. Prepared dinner at Saint Cloud shall be eaten by lips not royal, and Easter must be kept, whether or no, in Paris. Content must be his Royal Highness, if he can be confessed by non-conformist priest in the chapel of the Tuileries. La Fayette, chagrined, resigns his command of Na tional Guards refractory ; but pressed overmuch by friends and good of country, will later resume the office. Majesty is at length visibly imprisoned in his own palace. Let all Europe note the fact ! So was this royal feint, or royal plan, accomplished or circumvented. Did Louis intend to go ? is the question. That the peo ple did not intend he should is what is mainly visible. That La Fayette thought it a plan, not a feint, is also evident. But history leans rather to the supposition that Louis did not expect to eat Easter dinner at Saint Cloud. One thing is made more certain by this inci dent. Royalty, finding it difficult to fly, becomes 1 Carlyle."], [325, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 269 straightway bent upou its accomplishment. When Louis could have ridden off unmolested alone on horse back, flight was not then so enticing. When Bouille, La Fayette, and Mirabeau, the queen, and court advo cated departure, Louis was obstinately determined on two things, for Louis could sometimes maintain his stubbornness in spite of wavering will. These two things were, that he as king would never leave the soil of France, and that also he would never occasion civil war. From whence did this vacillating king imbibe these two fixed ideas ? From history and from a picture. Vandyck's famous portrait of Charles I. had been pur chased in England by an agent of the last favorite of Louis XV., Madame du Barry, on the strange pretence that the page therein depicted, being named Barry, she esteemed it a family picture, and therefore desired to obtain it. But this was not the wily Du Barry's real motive. In order to play her part in leading the king whithersoever his councillors, who, with crafty cumiing, had made her their agent in their political schemes, desired that he should be led, Madame du Barry, think ing that her counsels whispered into the royal ear might need objective teaching to enforce them on the mind of the weak and dissolute king, hung this noble picture upon the walls of her boudoir, \u2014 a mute witness of her mad follies. When she had given the king some political lessons, which had been taught her by the crafty coun cillors, who had placed her in her present position for this very purpose, she would take the king by the neck, and, turning his face towards the portrait, point to Charles I., and exclaim, \" Look, France ! \" (for thus she used to call Louis XV.) \" there is a king whose head was cut off because he was indulgent towards his parliament. Go now, and be indulgent to yours ! \""], [326, "270 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. This portrait of Charles I. had been transferred by Louis XVI. to the king's apartments, and had afterwards followed him, with some of the furniture of Versailles, to the Tuileries. Sitting before this picture, Louis XVI. read English history ; and from these two sources he derived this fixed impression, that Charles I. had been put to death for having made war upon his people, and that James II. had abdicated his throne by forsaking his people. Louis XVI., therefore, determined that he would neither leave France nor draw the sword. How could this king, obstinate as he was vacillating, be prevailed upon to fly ? This was the problem of the queen and court. Only by persuading him that he was not imitat ing James II. nor Charles I. Tutored by the clergy, he must first allow his kingly scruples to give way to his scruples as a Jesuit and a devotee. At this time, when his vain attempt to leave the Tuil eries had demonstrated his captivity before all Europe, he approved a letter drawn up by the Lameths, in which he is made to say that he was perfectly free. \" In this ridiculous letter, the king, speaking of himself in a Jacobin style, said that he was only the first public functionary ; that he was free, and had freely adopted the constitution, which constituted his happiness.\" At this same time the king was writing a contradiction. Louis deceived Montmorin, who deceived Lameth, as he had formerly done Mirabeau. The king sent word to Prussia and Austria that what he said in favor of the constitution was to be understood by them in an opposite sense. Educated as a Jesuit, Louis XVI. had been taught to believe that he who deceives for a good purpose could not use too much deception. His natural honesty had gained the ascendancy over him on most occasions ; but in this crisis, when religion and royalty were at stake,"], [327, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 271 he became only the Jesuit. \" His weak and troubled conscience feasted on two ideas, \u2014 first, he believed he was not imitating James II. , that he was not leaving his kingdom ; secondly, that he was not imitating Charles I., for he was not making war upon his people. These two points, which the history of England had impressed upon his mind, being avoided, he was afraid of nothing in the world, reposing tacitly on that ancient superstition which has emboldened kings to take so many guilty steps. ' What can happen to me, after all ? I am the Lord's anointed ! '\" 1 Marie Antoinette was frequently urged by her relations to flee from France alone ; but in answer to this proposal, she thus writes to her brother Leopold : \u2014 \u25a0 \"Pardon me, I beg of you, if I continue to reject your advice to leave Paris. Consider that I do not belong to myself. My duty is to remain where Providence has placed me, and to oppose my body, if the necessity should arise, to the knives of the assassins who would fain reach the king. I should be unworthy of the name of our mother, which is as dear to you as to me, if danger could make me desert the king and my children.\" In October, 1790, two Austrian partisans, Mercy and Breteuil, who were advisers of the queen, recommended flight. The queen caused the plan sent by Breteuil to be presented to the king by one of her firm friends, M. de Fersen, a Swedish officer, who afterwards aided them in their escape to Varennes. The entire plan of flight was not submitted to the king; but he was only urged to take refuge with M. de Bouille, stationed with his regiment near the Austrian frontier, where they might receive succor in case of need from Leopold, the queen's brother. King Louis listened to the proposed project, 1 Michelet."], [328, "272 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. but said nothing. The queen next tried her influence with the king, and succeeded at length in obtaining power to treat with foreigners, which was granted by Louis to Breteuil, the queen's secret agent. The carrying out of the details of the plan of escape was intrusted to the son of M. de Bouille' and M. de Fersen, together with the queen's secretary, Goguelat, and young Choiseul, son of the Due de Choiseul, who had negotiated the marriage of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette. This journey to Varennes was most imprudently planned, and recklessly consummated. That it is now difficult to fly, nay, almost impossible, Louis rouses his lethargic attention, and consents to fly. Steadfast only in his two sworn principles, he will not go out of France, and he will not raise the sword. This conceded by impatient partisans, his conscience is lulled. As to his duplicity between foreign courts and French people, that troubles him not : as a Jesuit devotee, that is only lawful expediency. Other events might afflict his devoted soul, were flight not now so urgent. For in stance, Pope Pius VI. has seen fit, in his holy indigna tion, to excommunicate Bishop Talleyrand. But behold, in the Palais Royal, another holy father prevails with patriotic people. Father Adam, ci-devant Marquis Saint- Huruge, will publicly resent this papal anathema. In the midst of a cheering multitude Father Adam towers tall, in white hat, visible, and by means of his thunder tones also audible. They bear aloft Pope Pius VI., in plush and tiara, and with the keys of power and other marks of popish splendor. But when one examines closer, this reverend pope is found to be made of straw and gum and board and plaster. It matters not : he shall be burned in effigy. That will suffice for wounded"], [329, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 273 feelings. The affair is well conducted, proper speeches are made, and acclaim is not wanting, and enthusiasm is awake ; and the Pope goes up in flame and smoke most luridly, aided thereto by piles of newspapers, condemned numbers of the Ami-du-Roi. \"In such extraordinary manner does dead Catholicism somersault and caper, skilfully galvanized. For, does the reader inquire into the subject-matter of controversy in this case, What the difference between Orthodoxy or My-doxy and Heterodoxy or Thy-doxy might there be ? My-doxy is, that an august National Assembly can equal ize the extent of bishoprics ; that an equalized bishop, his creed and formularies, being left quite as they were, can swear fidelity to king, law, and nation, and so become a constitutional bishop. Thy-doxy, if thou be dissident, is that he cannot ; but that he must become an accursed thing. This auto-de-fe of Saint-Huruge's was on the 4th of May, 1791. Royalty sees it, but says nothing.\" 1 For royalty is now immersed in ominous preparations. At least, this is the occupation of female royalty. The king wots not, nor cares not what they do, so long as his favorite pastime of lock-making is not interfered with. \" Royalty, in fact, should, by this time, be far on with its preparations. Unhappily much preparation is need ful. Could a hereditary representative be carried in leather vache, how easy were it ! But it is not so. New clothes are needed, as usual, in all epic transactions, were it in the grimmest iron ages. Consider ' Queen Chrim hilde, with her sixty sempstresses,' in that iron Nibelungen Song ! No queen can stir without new clothes.

Moreover, her Majesty cannot go a step any whither without her nicessaire, dear nicessaire, of inlaid ivory and rosewood, cunningly devised, which holds perfumes, toilette implements, infinite small, queen-like furnitures, necessary to terrestrial life. Not without a cost of some five hundred louis, of much precious time, and difficult hoodwinking which does not blind, can this same neces sary of life be forwarded by the Flanders carriers, \u2014 never to get to hand. All which, you would say, augurs ill for the prospering of the enterprise. But the whims of women and queens must be humored.\" 1 Bouille, meanwhile, is forming a fortified camp at Montmedy. Thither he will gather what loyal troops may be relied on to \"watch the Austrians,\" so he says to the world; to receive the king, so he agrees with the court. Young Count Fersen multiplies his visits suspi ciously to the Tuileries. But then, why not ? So brave a soldier, so devoted to the queen, has surely right to pay his court to her. But Commandant Gouvion, second in command of the National Guards, watching at the palace, scents danger ; or rather, his sweetheart, a chambermaid in her Majesty's apartments, peering with feminine curi osity into every nook and corner, perceives empty jewel cases on the table, suspicious bundles in the boudoirs, clothes packed, as though for travel, and other ominous signs of contemplated departure, and with feminine volu bility discloses these tit-bits of gossip to her soldier lover. Gouvion doubts, but knows not rightly which to doubt, the unreliable impressions of a saucy coquette, or the published declaration of his king, that he has no inten tion to leave his kingdom. He thinks it worth while, however, to report to his superior officer La Fayette, 1 Carlyle."], [331, "275 MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. who, to make all things sure, waits upon the king, and respectfully inquires if these reports of flight are trust worthy. King Louis, now at last alert, answers him so good-naturedly in the negative, laying meanwhile this sin of prevarication on the Jesuit side of his honest soul, where it would sit lightly and trouble him little, that La Fayette is completely deceived; and, having by way of precaution doubled the guard, he feels no further uneasiness. Some say the king, some say the queen, let us say, rather, both imprudently together, had determined that they must have a large, convenient carriage for their journey. An immense coach, called a Berline, was there fore ordered by M. de Fersen. It was large enough for king and queen, Madame Elizabeth, royal children, and governess. It was suggested that \" a very resolute sol dier, recommended by M. de Bouille, should ride in this carriage, with the royal family, to give answers when required, and to conduct the whole affair. But Madame de Tourzel, the governess of the royal children, main tained the privilege of her charge. By virtue of the oath that she had taken, it was her duty, her right, not to leave the children ; and the word oath made a great impression on Louis XVI. Moreover, it was a thing unheard of in the annals of etiquette for the royal chil dren (enfants de France) to travel without a governess. Therefore the governess entered, and not the soldier ; and, instead of an able man, they had a useless woman. The expedition had no leader, nobody to direct it ; it was left to go alone, and at random.\" l To redeem the imprudence of this huge coach, so visible to all men, when its occupants must endeavor, for their very lives, to remain invisible, M. de Bouille had 1 Michelet."], [332, "276 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. procured a passport, which read thus: \" De par le Roi. Mandons de laisser passer Madame la Baronne de Korff, se rendant & Franckfort avec deux enfants, une fenime de chambre, un valet de chambre, et trois domestiques.\" As a Russian baroness of great wealth might travel with such strange ostentation, with outriders in bright yellow jackets, and the capacious Berline piled up with heaps of trunks, leathern boxes, and huge portmanteaus, it was hoped the passport might counterbalance the reckless imprudence of this method of travelling. \" Mis erable new Berline ! Why could not royalty go in some old Berline similar to that of other men ? Flying for life, one does not stickle about his vehicle. Monsieur, in a commonplace travelling-carriage, is off northwards ; Madame, his princess, in another, with variation of route. They cross one another while changing horses, without look of recognition, and reach Flanders, no man questioning them.\"1 But foolish Louis thinks it sufficient safety to disguise his corpulent body in a valet's dress ; while the fair queen becomes a pretty waiting-maid ; Madame Elizabeth, a travelling-companion to the Russian baroness, repre sented by the governess ; and the little dauphin and Madame Royale, for the time being, shall be thought to be the children of the baroness. It is eleven o'clock at night, the 20th of June, 1791. Preparations have culminated in completion ; and now the plan is to be tested. What signs are there of coming events ? One is this : a large glass-coach stands drawn up in the Rue de l'Echelle, a short distance from the outer gate of the Tuileries, near the Place du Carrousel.

So think the few passers-by, wending their way homeward, belated by pleasure or business. In the palace, it is the hour for the king's retiring; and, as usual, he betakes himself to his apartments. The queen lingers a little, as was her wont, receiving good-night adieus in the grand salon, and retires also ; and the guests who are not to remain for the night within the palace prepare to depart. As some of these pass out, two hooded dames, with two small children well wrapped up, \u2014 for the night may be chill, \u2014 also leave the Tuileries, and with quickened step reach the glass-coach in the Rue de l'Echelle, and enter. But still the carriage waits. Pres ently, a thick-set individual, in servant's dress, walking arm-in-arm with a courier, approaches the same vehicle. The portly man enters, but still the carriage waits. Meanwhile, behold a graceful female dressed as a waiting maid, in gypsy-hat and servant's smart attire, leaning on the arm of some courier-beau, apparently, might have been seen in the Place du Carrousel. At this moment, La Fayette's carriage, flaring with lights, rolls by, towards the palace ; for rumor has once more reached him of flight ; and, as he again passes on his way back, having found all things quiet, and the king reported retired, the pretty gypsy-maid tosses her proud head, with a motion more queenly than saucy, as it was meant to be, in agreement with gypsy-hat, and disguise, and a smile of triumph crosses the beautiful face. Beware, Marie Antoinette ! Thou art not yet safe ; thy queenly carriage and haughty head will yet betray thee, if thou dost not take care. Midnight clangs from city steeples ; and the pretty waiting-maid reaches the glass-coach in safety, much to the relief of the fat valet, who sits pant ing with anxiety. Oh, poor Louis, 'tis a pity thou art a king ! Thou wouldst have been so much more comfort-"], [334, "278 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. able if thou hadst, perchance, been in reality a valet-de chambre, as thou art now in masquerade. But a most serious masquerade will this one prove to be. Yes, pretty, laughing femme-de-chambre, amused now at thy grotesque appearance, what an awful change wilt thou behold in thyself, when, in a few short hours, thou shalt lay aside thy gypsy-hat ! It will be the masquerade of death thou shalt next play, in stern reality, for which thy shining hair shall bleach itself, with no help of wig maker or toilet-powder. Drive, now, Coachman Fersen, for thy life, and for the lives thou bearest in thy glass-coach ! Now Paris is behind them, and they reach the spot where stands the new berline, harnessed to six horses, waiting the coming of the Baroness de Korff and party. Quickly the glass coach is exchanged for the showy berline. One hour and a half has been lost by the way, and that lost hour shall yet cost them dear. Coachman Fersen mounts the box of the new berline, and sets the glass-coach adrift. No time to note the fate of rejected glass-coaches. Two body-guards, disguised as couriers, in unfortunate bright yellow, ride behind. The ponderous berline, topped with notable baggage, now sets out with redoubled speed. \" C'est bien ! \" They breathe more freely. On to Bondy, where it would seem prudent that Fersen should leave them, and take another route himself, that thus the scent of following spies may be, perchance, removed from the berline to pursue Fersen, and so save time. With chiv alrous respect, in spite of coachman's clothes, the gallant Swedish officer bids royalty adieu. Again they start and ride, one body-guard now on the box, another gal loping by carriage-window, within easy hearing. A third, M. de Valory, riding on before, to order new relays of horses. Just now, M. Valory being near, the queen"], [335, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 279 said to him, with tones betokening hope, \" Francis, all goes well ; we should have been stopped before now, if it was to have been.\" Ah, fair queen ; all things go not so well ! A trace is broken. To mend it takes some precious minutes. Then Louis, as morning dawns, must needs walk up a hill, \" 'tis so delightful to breathe the air ! \" Ah, Louis ! there is a steeper hill before thee, which thou shalt not desire to climb, but nevertheless wilt find thou must ; yes, steep and awful, and leads upwards to a scaf fold! Meanwhile, as the berline drives, some other things are worthy of note. Three leagues beyond Chalons, towards which place lies the proposed route of the ber line, young Choiseul is stationed with forty hussars. In order to account for this and other detachments which have been observed along the road, the unfortunate rea son is given, that they were to guard a treasure, expected to pass that way. Unlucky excuse ! for, at that very time, rumor declared that the queen was sending money to Austria. Unfortunate blunder, that word \"treasure.\" Meantime, five or six hours' delay beyond the appointed coming of the berline made Choiseul imagine that the flight had been prevented. The peasants were gathering in numbers, suprised at these strange hussars, and laughing at the excuse of treasure. Alarm-bells tolled ominous ; and Choiseul resolved that departure was the best policy, and so he left his post. Another grievous blunder ! The king arrived, just after the troops were gone, and found no Choiseul, no huzzars ; but, as all seemed quiet, the berline drove on to Sainte-Menehould. The presence of dragoons and hussars during the day in this village had already roused suspicion; and the postmaster's son, Drouet, recognized the king as he put his head out of"], [336, "280 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the carriage-window, from the resemblance to the imprint on a coin. As Captain Dandoins and his dragoons are parading the streets, Drouet thinks it not well to try and stop the berline, and he therefore allows it to continue its jour ney ; but meanwhile he mounts a swift horse, and rides towards Varennes, hoping there to have the king's flight arrested. \" This comes of mysterious escorts, and a new berline with eleven horses. 'He that has a secret should not only hide it, but hide that he has it to hide.' \" These body-guards, dressed as couriers, are doubtless well armed ? No ! they have no arms but small hunting knives, and have never travelled before over this road. The king informed them that they would find arms in the carriage ; but Fersen, in fear for the queen, had neg lected to put the weapons in the Berline, thinking that loaded arms might be dangerous for the occupants of the carriage. Ridiculous want of foresight ! \" You will put in the carriage-box,\" said Louis XVI. to his trusty attendant, on the eve of departure, \"the red coat with gold lace, that I wore at Cherbourg.\" And the red coat is hidden, and Louis assumes the dress of a valet. \" What he thus hides in the box would have been his defence. The dress the king of France wore on the day when he appeared against England, amidst his fleet, was better calculated to consecrate him than the holy ampulla of Reims. Who would have dared to arrest him, if, throwing open his dress, he had shown that coat ? He ought to have kept it, or, rather, to have kept the French heart, as he then possessed it.\" i Another grievous thing concerning this journey to Varennes, was the seeming indifference with which Louis 1 Michelet."], [337, "281 MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. sacrificed, by his departure, the men who were sincerely attached to him. He never appeared to consider that per chance he was abandoning La Fayette and the minister Montmorin to assassination. As La Fayette was the involuntary guardian of the king, and the nation held him responsible for his person, the startling news of the king's departure would render La Fayette liable to be torn to pieces by the infuriated populace. The minister Montmorin had been allowed to write on the 1st of this very month of June to the Assembly, affirming, \" on his responsibility, on his life, and on his honor, that the king had never thought of leaving France.\" And to the unfortunate Laporte, the steward of the king's house hold, Louis had left, at his departure, a sealed letter, which contained the news of his flight, and his protesta tion to the Assembly, leaving to Liporte no choice in the matter, but forcing upon him the terrible task of making known his sovereign's flight. While the berline is whirling like the wind towards Varennes, spurred on by the danger of arrest, which grows more ominous, we must return to Paris long enough to note the effect of the startling news, which by this time is causing such astonishment and indignation. At six o'clock on the morning of the 21st of June, there is great commotion in the palace. Servants enter ing the apartments of their Majesties, can find no royalty to minister unto. In vain are boudoirs searched, and bed-chambers unlocked ; King Louis evidently has not pressed those pillows this night, and Marie Antoinette's gorgeous couch, when the silken curtains are drawn back, reveals no mortal being. Fly to the room of the precious dauphin ! perhaps both parents may be there. But behold there is no dauphin, and Madame Royale and Madame Elizabeth are also gone. There can now"], [338, "282 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. be no more doubt. Royalty has fled. Gouvion's sweet heart would have been the first to make an outcry, in shrill tone declaring, \" I told you so ! \" But this too curious maid had been suspected of gossiping, and had been dismissed some days before. But there are other maids with chattering tongues, and the news does not wait, for there are many mouths to spread it. \" The king is gone ! \" is soon the cry throughout Paris. La Fayette hears it amongst the first, and hastens with Gouvion to the king's apartments. Rumor for this time is at length truth. Better if they had trusted rumor before this ; some things might have been prevented ; some things might have been changed. But this deceit ful rumor had cried wolf ! wolf ! so often, that the shep herds guarding the king were scarcely to blame for not heeding. But emergency is always La Fayette's oppor tunity. He is not dismayed though a crowd of Bonnets Rouges, led by the brewer Santerre, promenade the streets, crying that La Fayette is a traitor. Beholding one of his officers in danger from the infuriated mob, La Fayette plunges into their midst, with authoritative voice, and de mands his release. A wild-eyed man, frenzied with rage, shakes his fist in La Fayette's face, exclaiming, \"You are a traitor! You have permitted the king to escape, and now France is ruined ! \" \" How ruined ? \" replies La Fayette, smiling ; \" France has twenty-five millions of inhabitants ; the salary of the king is twenty-five millions of francs. We are clear gainers, my friend. Every one of us gains twenty sous by Louis XVI. relieving us of this payment.\" This pleasant raillery of the self-possessed La Fayette restores the good-nature of the crowd. He is greeted with loud laughter, which ends in hearty cheers, and he rides away followed by applause."], [339, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 283 La Fayette, in consulting with M. Bailly, mayor of Paris, and M. Beauharnais, president of the National Assembly, in regard to this momentous event, when the president of the Assembly was lamenting the time which must elapse before the Assembly could be convoked to issue a degree authorizing pursuit ; \" Is it your opinion,\" inquired La Fayette, \" that the arrest of the king and royal family is absolutely essential to the public safety and can alone preserve us from civil war ? \" \" No doubt can be entertained upon that subject,\" both replied. \"Well then,\" said La Fayette, \"I take upon myself all responsibility of this arrest.\" He immediately issued an order to the National Guard throughout France, for the arrest of the king; and he despatched his aide-de-camp, Rom\u0153uf, with another officer of the guard, to hasten with all speed to Varennes and overtake Louis XVI. Napoleon at St. Helena, speaking in the light of subse quent events, said : \" The National Assembly never com mitted so great an error, as in bringing back the king from Varennes. A fugitive, and powerless, he was hastening to the frontier, and in a few hours would have been out of the French territory. What should they have done in these circumstances? Clearly have facilitated his escape, and declared the throne vacant by his desertion. They would thus have avoided the infamy of a regicide government, and attained their great object of republican institutions. Instead of which, by bringing him back, they encumbered themselves with a sovereign whom they had no just reason for destroying, and lost the inestimable advantage of getting rid of the royal family without an act of cruelty.\" And what say the people of Paris regarding the flight"], [340, "284 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. of the king? Marat, who edited a paper called \"The Friend of the People,\" was, says Lamartine, \"the Fury of the Revolution. He had the clumsy tumblings of the brute in his thought and its gnashings of teeth in his style. His journal smelt of blood in every line.\" This Marat, the morning after the flight, issued the following proclamation to the people : \u2014 \" People ! behold the loyalty, the honor, the religion of kings. Remember Henry III. and the Duke of Guise. At the same table with his enemy did Henry receive the sacrament, and swear on the same altar eternal friend ship. Scarcely had he left the table than he distributed poniards to his followers, summoned the duke to his cabinet, and there saw him fall, pierced with wounds. Trust not then to the oath of princes ! \" On the morning of the 19th, Louis XVI. laughed at his oath and enjoyed beforehand the alarm his flight would cause you. The Austrian woman has won over La Fayette. Louis XVL, disguised in a priest's robe, fled with the dauphin, his wife, his brother, and all the family. He now laughs at the folly of the Parisians, and will soon swim in their blood. Citizens ! this escape has been long prepared by the traitors of the National Assembly. You are on the brink of ruin ; hasten to provide for your safety. Instantly choose a dictator. Let your choice fall upon the citizen who has, up to the present, displayed most zeal, activity, and intelligence, and do all he bids you to do to strike at your foes. This is the time to lop off the heads of Bailly, La Fayette, and all the scoundrels of the staff, all the traitors of the Assembly. A tribune, a military tribune, or you are lost without hope.\" And pray whom did this \" dogleech Marat \" consider that noble citizen upon whom the choice of dictatorship"], [341, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 285 should fall ? Doubtless, his worthy self, former horse doctor to Count dArtois ! He without fail would lop off the heads of many persons, if he had the chance. Alas ! that chance will come later. In the Palais Royal, too, there was dire confusion and exclamation of surprise. A group were discussing with much consternation the results which might arise from the king's flight, when a man in threadbare coat leaped upon a bench, and thus addressed the multitude : \u2014 \" Citizens, listen to a tale which shall not be a long one. A certain well-meaning Neapolitan was once on a time startled in his evening walk by the astounding intelli gence that the Pope was dead. He had not recovered from his astonishment, when, behold, he was informed of a new disaster, the king of Naples was also no more. ' Surely,' said the worthy Neapolitan, 'the sun must vanish from the heaven at such a combination of fatalities ! ' But they did not cease here. The Archbishop of Palermo, he was informed, had also died suddenly. Overcome by this last shock, he retired to bed, but not to sleep. In the morning he was disturbed in his melancholy reverie by a rumbling noise, which he recognized at once to be the motion of the wooden instrument which makes mac caroni. ' Aha ! ' says the good man, starting up, ' can I trust my ears ? The Pope is dead, the king of Naples is dead, the Bishop of Palermo is dead ; yet my neighbor, the baker, still makes maccaroni. Come, the lives of these great men are not then so indispensable to the world, after all.'\" The man in the great coat jumped down and disap peared. But his story had been understood. \" I have caught his meaning,\" said a woman among the listeners; \"he has told us a tale, and it begins like all tales \u2014 there was once a king and a queen.\""], [342, "286 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. In truth, there was once a king and a queen in France. There was once a king, \u2014 Louis XIV, \u2014 and the people kneio his power. There was once a king, \u2014 Louis XVI, \u2014 and the people had already found out that they could live without his presence. The lives of these royal men are not then so indispensable to the world, after all. The crowd rushed to the Tuileries. They pressed in at doors and windows. A fruit-woman emptied her basket of cherries upon the queen's bed ; and as she sat down be side them on the gorgeous couch which she had thus made her truck-table, from which to sell her ruddy fruit, she exclaimed, with satisfied content, \" It is the nation's turn to-day to take their ease.\" Curious women peered into the queen's boudoirs and wardrobes, and some one placed a cap upon the head of a young girl, who, with mock horror, snatched it off and threw it on the floor, crying, \" The Austrian's cap will sully my forehead ! \" A portrait of Louis was taken from his chamber and hung up at the gate of the chateau, that all passers-by might insult this image of their king. Disgraceful ? Yes. But it is the mob's turn to-day, and mobs are always disgraceful. And now at nine o'clock the National Assembly are convoked, and behold poor Laporte must' face the music ! Reluctant he enters there, bearing the letter and ominous protestation. Meekly he lays them on the table, and humbly requests that the letter, which is personal to him, from his Majesty, be not read, if it so pleases the august Assembly. This request is granted. No need to read the letter ; Louis' official protestation is all-sufficient. This memorable memorial was dated the 20th of June, and was written and signed by the king. It was entitled: \" Proclamation of the King to all the French upon his Departure from Paris.\""], [343, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 287 In the recital of his grievances the king \" complained that he had only a sus2)ensive veto ; that his salary was cut down to five millions of dollars annually, which was not sufficient to support him comfortably; that he was very badly lodged in the palace of the Tuileries; that he had been incessantly annoyed by the National Assembly, the clubs, and the journals ; and that he was not properly applauded when he appeared in public. He bitterly censured the decrees of the National Assembly, and avowed that of his own free will he left Paris, that he might at a safe distance regain his lost power.\" Ah, Louis ! what a pity that this fit of bold self assertion did not attack you sooner, or not at all. Had you been braver sooner to maintain your rights, all might have been well ; this last burst of defiance will avail you nothing but fresh hatred and closer imprisonment. If five millions of dollars are not sufficient for your yearly support, the nation will take care of you for immeasura bly less ; if the Tuileries lodges you badly, you can try the Temple ; if you have not been received with sufficient commotion by the populace, they will yet remedy that ; if the National Assembly has annoyed you, they will place you where nothing earthly can further disturb you. Poor foolish Louis ! this daring proclamation is the most foolhardy and pusillanimous of all your acts ! puerile complaints, from a king, are of no avail ; Louis XIV. would have appeared whip in hand, and in thunder-tones, with eye flashing like the lion's, would have cried, \" L'Etat! c'est moi!\" How low has sovereignty fallen since Louis le Grand ! \" We are the state ! \" now cry the National Assembly ; king, or no king, it makes no difference to France ! And straightway the Assembly assumed the Regency ; issued an order sanctioning the measures of La Fayette;"], [344, "288 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. despatched couriers on every road, with orders to arrest any individuals leaving the kingdom ; ordered guns from the arsenal, and placed Paris in a state of defence. Ah, France herself is the sovereign now ; she needs no gilt paper figure of royalty. On the Quai Voltaire La Fayette was met by Camille Desmoulins. The excited journalist rushed up to the white horse with impetuosity, and as La Fayette reined in his steed, Desmoulins exclaimed: \"Monsieur de La Fayette, for more than a year I have constantly spoken ill of you. This is the moment to convict me of false hood. Prove that I am a calumniator. Cover me with infamy by saving the state ! \" Grasping the hand of Camille warmly, La Fayette replied : \" I have always recognized you as a good citi zen. You will see that you have been deceived. Our common oath is to live free or to die. All goes well. There is but one feeling in the Assembly. The common danger has united all parties.\" Mignet says of La Fayette : \" There have been in our day few lives more pure than La Fayette's, few charac ters more beautiful, few men whose popularity has been more justly won and longer maintained. After defend ing liberty in America, at the side of Washington, he desired to establish it in our Revolution. When a people in the pursuit of liberty has no internal dissension, and no foes but foreigners, it may find a deliverer ; may pro duce, in Switzerland, a William Tell ; in the Netherlands, a Prince of Orange ; in America, a Washington ; but when it pursues it against its own countrymen and for eigners, at once amidst factions and battles, it can only produce a Cromwell or a Bonaparte, who become the dictators of revolutions when the struggle subsides and parties are exhausted. La Fayette, an actor in the"], [345, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 289 first epoch of the crisis, enthusiastically declared for its results. He became the general of the middle class, at the head of the National Guard, under the Constituent Assembly, in the army under the Legislative Assembly. It may be said of him, that if he committed some faults of position, he had ever but one object, \u2014 liberty, \u2014 and that he employed but one means, \u2014 the law. The manner in which, when yet quite young, he devoted himself to the deliverance of the two worlds, his glorious conduct, and his invariable firmness, will transmit his name with honor to posterity, with whom a man cannot have two reputations, as in the time of party, but his own alone.\" The Assembly, hesitating to assume that the king had perjured himself by violating the oath he had so solemnly taken to sustain the Constitution, adopted the more generous supposition of his abduction, and declared that Louis XVI. had been carried off, during the night, by some enemies of the nation. What shall we say ? So weak had been Louis' will to go, and so weak had been his will to stay, and so waver ing had been his mind, that they might well declare him carried off, in one of his vacillating fits by wills stronger than his own. But Louis merits not all pity. Why was he not a man, to do and dare ? None but such should rightly hold a sceptre. Would that Marie Antoinette had been queen of France in her own right ! Can we really call her blamable that she sought Austria's help when France would have gladly cut off her head ? To whom should she turn if not to her brother the emperor ? If she were guilty, then are all political intrigues in famous, all strategies of war dastardly, all strategic pre varications and diplomatic ruses base lies, only to be condemned as guilt, and not upheld as marks of able statesmanship. From the first moment her slender foot"], [346, "290 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. had touched the soil of France, the nation hated her. Why ? She was an Austrian. But on the side of Marie Antoinette, we must declare, most foully was she wronged. She was a woman, beautiful, courageous, imperial, and yet most gently kind. Without the reins of government in her own hands, she was forced to use the means she had; these were ill-advisers, haughty courtiers, a weak but mulishly stubborn husband, a brother thinking more of his own kingdom than of his sister's peril, spies even in her own private apartments, and bitter enemies spread ing the foul poison of calumny everywhere against her. When on one occasion Marie Antoinette discovered Madame Campan taking certain precautions lest the queen should be maliciously poisoned by means of some powdered sugar, which her Majesty was accustomed to keep upon her table and sometimes partake of; knowing this, Madame Campan often exchanged the sugar in the dish for some she herself carried, as the court physician had warned her against attempts to poison the queen \u2022 Marie Antoinette said to her : \" Remember, that not a grain of poison will be used against me. The Brinvil liers do not belong to this century ; this age possesses calumny, which is a much more convenient instrument of death ; and it is by that I shall perish.\" And perish by the brutal stab of calumny she did, poor Marie Antoinette ! And so rank was the poison of the foul lies circulated against her, that the pages of history will ever remain tainted by their scandalous breath. Charles Duke Yonge, professor of history in Queen's College, Belfast, in his \" Life of Marie Antoinette,\" says : \"It is no exaggeration to say that the history of the whole world has preserved no record of greater heroism, in either sex, than was shown by Marie Antoinette dur ing the closing years of her life. No courage was ever"], [347, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 291 put to the proof by such a variety and such an accumu lation of dangers and miseries ; and no one ever came, out of an encounter with even far inferior calamities, with greater glory. Her moral courage and her physical courage were equally tried. It was not only that her own life, and lives far dearer to her than her own, were exposed to daily and hourly peril, or that to this danger were added repeated vexations of hopes baffled and trust betrayed ; but these griefs were largely aggravated by the character and conduct of those nearest to her. In stead of meeting with counsel and support from her hus band and his brothers, she had to guide and support Louis himself, and even to find him so incurably weak as to be incapable of being kept in the path of wisdom by her sagacity, or of deriving vigor from her fortitude ; while the princes were acting in selfish and disloyal op position to him, and, in a great degree, sacrificing him and her to their perverse conceit, if we may not say to their faithless ambition. She had to think for all, to act for all, to struggle for all ; and to bear up against the conviction that her thoughts, and actions, and struggles were being balked of their effect by the very persons for whom she was exerting herself ; that she was but labor ing to save those who would not be saved. Yet, through out that protracted agony of more than four years, she bore herself with an unswerving righteousness of pur pose, and an unfaltering fearlessness of resolution, which could not have been exceeded had she been encouraged by the most constant success. And in the last terrible hours, when the monsters who had already murdered her husband, were preparing the same fate for herself, she met their hatred and ferocity with a loftiness of spirit which even hopelessness could not subdue. Long before, she had declared that she had learnt, from the"], [348, "292 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. example of her mother, not to fear death ; and she showed that this was no empty boast, when she rose in the last scenes of her life, as much even above her earlier displays of courage and magnanimity, as she also rose above the utmost malice of her vile enemies. \" Every old libel and pretext for detraction was dili gently revived. The old nickname of ' The Austrian ' was repeated with pertinacity as spiteful as causeless ; even the king's aunts lending their aid to swell the clamor on that ground, and often saying, with all the malice of their inveterate jealousy, that it was not to be expected that she should have the same feelings as their father, or Louis XIV., since she was not of their blood, though it was plain that the same remark would have applied to every queen of France since Anne of Brittany. Even the embarrassments of the revenue were imputed to her ; and she, who had curtailed her private expenses, even those which seemed almost necessary to her posi tion, that she might minister more largely to the neces sities of the poor; who had declined to buy jewels, that the money might be applied to the service of the state, was now held up to the populace as being, by her ex travagance, the prime cause of the national distress. Pamphlets and caricatures gave her a new nickname of ' Madame Deficit ' ; and such a feeling was thus excited against her in the minds of the lower classes, that a painter, who had just finished an engaging portrait of Marie Antoinette surrounded by her children, feared to send it to the exhibition, lest it should be made a pre text for insult and violence. \" Marie Antoinette had pride ; pride of birth ; pride of rank ; though never did that feeling show itself more nobly or more beneficially. It never led her to think herself above the very meanest of her subjects. It never"], [349, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 293 made her indifferent to the interests, to the joys or sor rows, of a single individual. The idea with which it inspired her was, that a princess of her race was never to commit an unworthy act, was never to fail in purity of virtue, in truth, in courage ; that she was to be careful to set an example of these virtues to those who would naturally look up to her ; and that she herself was to keep constantly in her mind the example of her illus trious mother, and never, by act, or word, or thought, to discredit her mother's name. And, as she thus regarded courage as her birthright, so she possessed it in abun dance and variety. She had courage to plan, and cour age to act ; courage to resolve, and courage to adhere to the resolution once deliberately formed ; and*, above all, courage to endure and to suffer, and, in the very extrem ity of misery, to animate and support others less royally endowed.\" 1 But we must follow the young officer Rom\u0153uf to Var ennes. Or rather, let us take the road a little before him with the whirling berline. Heavy craft, heavily weighted, not only with the flesh of portly Louis, but with vital interests weightier far than the king's bodily corpulency. Weightier far than all the formidable bag gage of the would-be Baroness de Korff. Better had it been if this berline had been more properly freighted with these unseen but most momentous interests, rather than so burdened with this material luggage. Stout hearts, wise heads, and successful plans were of more avail in such expeditions than queenly finery and kingly portliness ; for flesh cannot take the place of will and muscle in the battle of life. Horse-flesh, indeed, is straining itself to the utmost in the race ; but vain will be the effort unless a master mind holds the reins. And 1 Charles Duke Yonge."], [350, "294 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. even horse-muscle will not be given fair play in this wild chase ; for foolish Louis must needs stop the car riage at the entrance of Varennes, where he was to have met relays ; before the bridge, said Secretary Go guelat, the fresh horses will be stationed; and Louis's memory is strong if his will is weak, and Goguelat has forgotten to send word that a change has taken place, and thereby relays wait on the other side of the bridge ; and so Louis dismounts, and yellow-jacketed couriers are sent from door to door, waking up the sleepy village folks, whom it is so important to keep somnolent. A vital hour is wasted, when had Louis only driven across the bridge, he would have found Goguelat and horses waiting, and also hussars to escort him. Was ever a king or man so great a bungler in his own affairs ? Ac tive Drouet shall thereby overtake him, nay, even reach the bridge before him, by a side road ; and when slow witted Louis shall at length determine to cross the bridge after he has done all the mischief possible to his cause on this side, by stirring up the very mob who will hereafter imprison him in yonder grocer's shop, the berline clatters on the bridge, but midway meets barriers of wagons and logs and other piled-up obstructions, and in the darkness men seize the bridles of the horses, and a voice cries at the carriage door, \" In the name of the nation, stop ! You are driving the king.\" It is Drouet ! Will and muscle have accomplished his designs. Lights are flashing through the gloom. The streets are fast filling with people. The travellers are obliged to alight and deliver their passports. Upon this there is much discussion; the party corresponds with the passports. The Baroness de Korff and her attendants appear right as to number and description. But here again the quick-witted Drouet once more defeats their"], [351, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 295 plans. He has won by will and muscle ; he is now to win by his brains. \" Why is not the passport signed by the president of the National Assembly ? And if you are foreigners, how is it that you have influence to procure fifty dra goons to escort you at Saint Menehould, and as many more at Clermont ? And why is there a detachment of hussars waiting for you at Varennes ? \" eagerly demands the bold Drouet. And slow-witted Louis can answer nothing, and suspicion begins to work, and the evil is done, and cannot be remedied. The municipal officers of the town now come up, and the National Guard of Varennes have assembled, so that it will be next to im possible for the king to be rescued by the waiting hus sars, and these same hussars will soon fraternize with the people and refuse to obey Goguelat. '\u2022 What ! \" ex claim the multitude, \"the king running away, aban doning us, his children, and becoming a traitor to the nation ; going over to the enemy, to aid them to burn our homes and massacre us all ! \" The king and his party have been allowed to re-enter the carriage, and Drouet has conducted them back from the bridge to the door of the mayor of the town, who was a grocer, named Sausse. As the tumult increases around the carriage, and bells are ringing, and guns firing, drums beating, and crowds of men and women gathering around the captives, Sausse urges them to alight and enter his grocer-shop. Louis, to save the queen and himself from further in sults, said to the mob, \" Yes ! I am your king. Behold the queen and my children. We entreat you to show us the respect which the French have always manifested towards their sovereigns.\" Pitiable Louis ! Better were it for thee now if thy hidden red coat were on thy"], [352, "296 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. shoulders, instead of that servant's disordered array. Perchance thy dignity might then have had some effect. As it is, thy stolid body in valet's costume, presents thee in a woful plight. Thy fat cheeks pale with fear ; thy lips livid with consternation. What emotions canst thou expect to excite, save some pity with strong contempt ? \" Wiat, that the king ! that the queen ! \" exclaim the crowd, with astonishment. They have been taught to worship royalty as something divine ; and this piteous spectacle is all that France can show for royalty. Ah, Louis Quatorze ! How is thy greatness fallen ! How is thy splendid grandeur trampled in the dust ! If we wished to sum up Louis XVI.'s ruin in one word, that word would be, procrastination ! Always delaying for a moment when the time had come to act. Even now he might perchance have burst through the obstacles around him. Choiseul and Goguelat, with their fifty hussars, now came clattering into the streets of Varennes, from the other side of that fatal bridge where they had been awaiting his Majesty. Count Dumas also arrived, though without his dragoons, as they had abandoned him at Saint Menehould. These officers entered the shop. Choiseul, grasping signifi cantly the hilt of his sword, said boldly to the king : \" Sire, please give immediate orders to depart. I have forty hussars. No time is to be lost. In one hour they will be gained over by the people.\" Choiseul and Goguelat entreated the king and queen with the ladies to mount on horseback, the king holding the dauphin, and protected by the hussars they might yet escape. But Louis hesitated. \" Can you assure me that in this struggle a shot may not strike the queen, my sister, or the children ? Besides, the municipality does not forbid to let us pass ; it merely"], [353, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 297 requests me to wait till daybreak. Moreover, the Marquis de Bouille is at Stenay, but twenty-four miles distant. He cannot fail to learn of my detention, and he will be here with his troops in the morning.\" Fatal decision ! An hour passes ; the hussars are gained over, and are drinking with the people. Gogue lat, to test the spirit of the crowd, mounts his horse, when Drouet approaches him and says, \" You want to carry off the king, but you shall not have him alive.\" Goguelat still presses onward, when he is stopped by a detachment of the National Guard; and the major cries, \" One step farther, and I shoot you.\" Goguelat, undaunted, and determined to test to the utmost the possibility of flight, spurs his horse onward, when two bullets strike him, and he falls bleeding to the ground. As he rises, though thus wounded, he perceives two cannon at the end of the street ; there is evidently no longer any chance for flight, unless Bouille shall arrive with sufficient force. Goguelat, still bleeding from his wounds, enters the shop where the royal fugitives are. Louis has perchance saved the queen from such a wound, but he has doomed her to the scaffold. Better die fighting than lay their royal heads beneath the bloody knife of the guillotine. Strange spectacle that grocer's shop presented ! Never, from time memorial, has grocer's store presented the like. The beautiful queen of France was seated on a box of candles, amidst all sorts of merchandise, plead ing with tearful eyes with the grocer's wife, that she would intercede in their behalf with the mayor, her hus band. \" You are a mother, madame,\" said Marie Antoinette, with that tender voice of hers; \"you are a wife; the fate of a wife and mother is in your hands. Think what"], [354, "298 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. I must suffer for these children, for my husband. At one word from you I shall owe them to you. The Queen of France will owe you more than her kingdom, more than life ! \" \" I wish it were in my power to help you. But bless me ! you are thinking of your husband, and I am think ing of mine. Every woman for her own husband ! \" Ah, Marie Antoinette ! every woman for her own hus band, is now the cry in France. No longer, every man, woman, and child for the king ! Generous as it would have been in the woman to have perilled all to save the queen, all lives have rights. Royalty and humanity here touched, and found themselves at last upon a com mon level. Oh, what a night was that ! The queen entered that grocer's shop a brown-haired woman, and when she left it in the morning, her locks were bleached by sorrow. The people from without shout that they will see the king. To appease them, Louis goes to a window and looks out upon that mass of excited men and women. Torches flashing here and there light up the picture with lurid flames ; the humiliated king, in servant's dress, with woe-worn countenance, forms so pitiable a sight, that even those peasants weep ; and a few compas sionate voices cry faintly, \" Vive le Roi ! \" Again that hidden red coat might have worked wonders, with a kingly man to wear it. Poor Louis ! let us shed tears for him, since he can arouse naught but our contemptuous pity ! Once only shall he excite our profoundest admira tion: his heroism on the scaffold shall blot out many faults ! It were indeed well to die bravely, since he lives so pitiably ; but heroism in living is of more avail than heroism in dying. At seven o'clock in the morning the door opened, and"], [355, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 299 an officer of the National Guard of Paris entered. His dress was disorderly and dusty with hurried travel. \" Sire,\" he exclaimed, in great agitation, \" all Paris is being murdered ; our wives and children are perhaps assassinated ; you shall not go any farther ; sire, the interests of the state ; yes, sire, our wives and our chil dren ! \" The queen seized the hand of the bewildered officer and leading him to the corner of the room, where on a rude bed the two royal children lay sleeping, worn out with grief and terror, she said, as she pointed to them : \" Am I not a mother also ? \" Ah, daughter of Theresa ! you would both do and dare ; cruel indeed are the circumstances which thus prevent you ! The king said to the officer, \" What do you want? \" \" Sire,\" he replied, \" I have a decree of the Assembly.\" \" Where is it ?\" demanded the king. \" My comrade has it,\" answered the officer. Just then Rom\u0153uf entered the apartment, holding the decree in his hand, while a burning blush mounted to his forehead and his eyes were wet with tears. As the queen raised her mournful face, and recognized M. de Rom\u0153uf she exclaimed, with reproach : \" What, sir, is it you ? Oh ! I could never have believed it possible.\" \" We have done our duty,\" softly responded Rom\u0153uf ; \"but we hoped we should not have overtaken your Majesties.\" The king abruptly seized the decree and hastily read it. It was an order enjoining upon all public function aries \" to stop, by all the means in their power, the abduc tion of the king, and to prevent the continuance of the journey.\" Louis threw the decree upon the bed, by the side of"], [356, "300 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. his sleeping children, and exclaimed, in bitterness : \" There is no longer any king in France!\" Ah, Louis ! there has been no king in France; there was the trouble. Hadst thou been aught but a do-nothing king in France, thou wouldst not be here a captive in valet's attire, pleading with a grocer-mayor for thy lib erty. But Marie Antoinette is not yet crushed into servile submission ; with flushed cheek and flashing eye, she snatched up the decree from the bed and threw it with contempt upon the floor, exclaiming, \" It shall not defile my children ! \" Spirited Queen, how lovely in thy just wrath ! But such indignation will not avail now, hapless queen ! Captives must be docile. Prudent Rom\u0153uf said sorrowfully to the queen, with tender air of deference, \" Madame, in the name of your safety, your glory, I entreat you to control your grief ! \" Rom\u0153uf was right, and Marie Antoinette quickly recognized it ; the time had passed for the display of imperious pride and royal displeasure, and the poor queen learned quickly and well the terrible lesson. And from that moment no one could teach her aught of dignified endurance and calm despair. She fought the battle then and there, and the struggle turned her hair to snow and her heart to stone. Carlyle says : \" So, then, our grand Royalist Plot, of Flight to Metz, has executed itself. Long hovering in the background, as a dread royal ultimatum, it has rushed forward in its terrors, verily to some purpose. How many Royalist Plots and Projects, one after another, cunningly devised, that were to explode like powder mines and thunder-claps, not one solitary plot of which has issued otherwise ! Powder-mine of a Siance Royale on the twenty-third of June, 1789, which exploded as we"], [357, "ARREST OF THE ROYAL FAMILY."], [358, ""], [359, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 301 then said, ' through the touchhole ' ; which next, your war-god Broglie having ?-eloaded it, brought a Bastile about your ears. Then came fervent Opera-Repast, with flourishing of sabres, and 0 Richard, O my King ! which, aided by hunger, produces insurrection of women, and Pallas Athene in the shape of Demoiselle Theroigne. Valor profits not ; neither has fortune smiled on fan faronade. The Bouill6 Armament ends as the Broglie one had done. Man after man spends himself in this cause, only to work it quicker ruin ; it seems a cause doomed, forsaken of earth and Heaven. \"On the sixth of October, gone a year, King Louis, escorted by Demoiselle Theroigne and some two hundred thousand, made a royal progress and entrance into Paris, such as man had never witnessed ; we prophesied him two more such ; and, accordingly, another of them, after this Flight to Metz, is now coming to pass. Theroigne will not escort here ; neither does Mirabeau now ' sit in one of the accompanying carriages.' Mirabeau lies dead, in the Pantheon of Great Men. Theroigne lies living, in dark Austrian prison, having gone to Liege, profession ally, and been seized there. Bemurmured now by the hoarse-flowing Danube, the light of her Patriot supper parties gone quite out, so lies Theroigne ; she shall speak with the Kaiser face to face, and return. And France lies \u2014 how? Fleeting time shears down the great and the little, and in two years alters many things. \" But at all events, here, we say, is a second ignomini ous royal procession, though much altered; to be wit nessed also by its hundreds of thousands. Patience, ye Paris Patriots ; the Royal Berline is returning ! Not till Saturday ; for the royal berline travels by slow stages, amid such loud-voiced confluent sea of National Guards, sixty thousand as they count ; amid such tumult of all"], [360, "302 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. people. Three National-Assembly Commissioners, famed Barnave, famed Petion, generally respectable Latour- Maubourg, have gone to meet it ; of whom the two former ride in the berline itself, beside Majesty, day after day. Latour, as a mere respectability, and man of whom all men speak well, can ride in the rear, with Dame de Tourzel and the Soubrettes. \" So on Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, Paris by hundreds of thousands is again drawn up ; not now dancing the tri-color joy-dance of hope, nor as yet danc ing in fury-dance of hate and revenge ; but in silence, with vague look of conjecture, and curiosity mostly scientific. A Saint- Antoine Placard has given notice this morning that 'whosoever insults Louis shall be caned; whosoever applauds him shall be hanged.' Behold then, at last, that wonderful new berline, encircled by blue national sea with fixed bayonets, which flows slowly, floating it on, through the silent assembled hundreds of thousands. Three yellow couriers sit atop bound with ropes; Petion, Barnave, their Majesties, with Sister Eliza beth, and the Children of France are within. \" Smile of embarrassment, or cloud of dull sourness, is on the broad phlegmatic face of his Majesty, who keeps declaring to the successive official persons, what is evident, 'Eh bien, me voiliX !' [\" Well, here you have me ! \"] and, what is not evident, ' I do assure you that I did not mean to pass the frontiers ; ' and so forth : speeches natural for that poor Royal Man, which decency would veil. Silent is her Majesty, with a look of grief and scorn; natural for that Royal Woman. Thus lumbers and creeps the ignominious Royal Procession through many streets, amid a silent-gazing people; comparable, Mercer thinks, to some Procession de Roi de Basoche; or, say, procession of King Crispin, with his Dukes of Sutor-"], [361, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 303 mania and royal blazonry of Cordwainery. Except, indeed, that this is not comic ; ah, no : it is comico-tragic, with bound couriers, and a doom hanging over it ; most fantastic, yet miserably real. Miserablest flebile ludi brium of a Pickleherring Tragedy ! It sweeps along there in most w\u00bbgorgeous pall, through many streets in the dusty summer evening ; gets itself at length wriggled out of sight, vanishing in the Tuileries Palace, \u2014 towards its doom of slow torture, peine forte et dure. \" Populace, it is true, seizes the three rope-bound yel low couriers ; will, at least, massacre them. But our august Assembly, which is sitting at this great moment, sends out deputation of rescue, and the whole is got huddled up. Barnave, 'all dusty,' is already there, in the National Hall, making brief, discreet address and report. As, indeed, through the whole journey, this Barnave has been most discreet, sympathetic, and has gained the queen's trust, whose noble instinct teaches her always who is to be trusted. Very different from heavy Petion, who, if Campan speak truth, ate his luncheon, comfortably filled his wine-glass, in the royal berline ; flung out his chicken-bones past the nose of Royalty itself ; and, on the king's saying, ' France cannot be a Republic,' answered, 'No, it is not ripe yet.' Barnave is henceforth a queen's adviser, if advice could profit ; and her Majesty astonished Dame Campan by signifying almost a regard for Barnave, and that, in a day of retri bution and royal triumph, Barnave shall not be executed. \" On Monday night Royalty went ; on Saturday even ing it returns : so much within one short week has Royalty accomplished for itself. The Pickleherring Tragedy has vanished in the Tuileries Palace, towards 'pain strong and hard.'

She now ostentatiously handed him the keys of her trunks, implying that he would probably desire to search them. La Fayette, with a flush of wounded pride, would not receive them; and the queen threw them with some petu lance into his hat, which was upon the table. Without openly noticing the insult, La Fayette said, \"Madame, you must pardon me the trouble I give you in returning these keys. I certainly cannot touch them.\" During a brief conversation which La Fayette now held with the king, he said to the monarch : \u2014 \"Your Majesty is well aware of my attachment to your royal person ; but, at the same time, you were not ignorant that, if you separated yourself from the cause of the people, I should side with the people.\" \"This is true,\" replied Louis. \" You follow your prin ciples. And I tell you frankly that until lately I had believed you had surrounded me by a turbulent faction of persons of your own way of thinking, but that yours was not the real opinion of France. I have learned i Carlyle."], [363, "305 MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. during my journey that I was deceived, and that the general wish is in accordance with your views.\" On the day of the king's return the Assembly passed a decree suspending Louis from his royal functions until they should have heard the declarations of the king and queen. Barnave, who had won the confidence of Louis and Marie Antoinette, aided the king in composing his declaration in excuse of his flight. In this document Louis said : \" Never was it my intention to leave the king dom. I had no concert either with foreign powers, or with my relatives, or with any of the French emigrants. I had selected Montmedy, because, being nearer the frontiers, I should have been better able to oppose every kind of invasion of France, had a disposition been shown to attempt any. One of my principal motives for leaving Paris was to set at rest the argument of my non-freedom, which was likely to furnish occasion for disturbances. I have ascertained during my journey that public opinion is decidedly in favor of the Constitution. I did not con ceive that I could fully judge of this public opinion in Paris. As soon as I had ascertained the general will, I hesitated not, as I have never hesitated, to make a sac rifice of everything that is personal to me. I will gladly forget all the crosses that I have experienced, if I can but insure the peace and felicity of the nation.\" This declaration was received by the Assembly in re spectful silence. Vacillating Louis ! You do not mean this to be all a lie ! Let us give you the credit to think you did not mean to leave France ; but it must be admit ted that those who carried your weak will off did probably intend to make you do so. But you can now lay aside your Jesuit tactics ; no prevarications nor weak subter fuges will longer avail. The time is past for political expediency and diplomatic scheming. There is nothing"], [364, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 306 left thee but to be honest with thine own soul and with thy God. But meanwhile what has become of Bouille, and his regiment who were to aid in the king's escape ? During the night of June 20th, perplexed by the delay of the king, Bouille rode forward to within six miles of Va rennes, hoping to meet Louis. But seeing nothing of him, and fearing that in his absence he would be deserted by his soldiers, whom he could not trust, as they sympa thized with the patriots, he rode back to Stenay. Arriv ing there at half-past four in the morning, he was informed that the king had been arrested. Bouille had but one regiment in whom he could place confidence, and only one officer whom he could trust, and that young officer was his own son. Calling out this German regi ment, he starts for the rescue with his son. Swiftly these well-mounted dragoons sweep over the road between Stenay and Varennes. Ride for your lives, and for your king, ye fast-speeding soldiers ! Nine o'clock strikes and they are at Varennes ; but alas ! it is too late. The king has been gone an hour on his humiliating journey back to Paris. M. de Choiseul, M. de Goguelat, and M. de Dumas, are prisoners, and their hussars are fraterniz ing with the people. There is no hope, brave loyal Bouille ; whether one sympathizes or not with the patri ots, it is good to see a man true to his king if he pro fesses and believes in royalty. True to one's colors, whether the royal white cockade, or the patriot tri-color ! The sneaking turn-coats are the ones to be despised. And more yet will Bouill6 do for his king. Having slowly returned to Stenay, his soldiers also desert him. They are filled with the popular enthusiasm, and have become good patriots. This too is well ; we admire the soldiers"], [365, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 307 as much for sympathizing with the people, as we do Bouill6 for sticking close to his king. Abandoned by his regiment, Bouille must now fly for his safety. This he does, and narrowly escapes with his life across the frontier to Luxembourg. Thiers says : \" Bouille, in order to draw upon himself the indignation of the Assembly, addressed to it a letter which might be called mad, but for the generous motive which dictated it. He avowed himself the sole author of the king's journey, though, on the contrary, he had opposed it. He declared in the name of the sovereigns, that Paris should be responsible for the safety of the royal family, and that the slightest injury offered to them should be signally avenged. He added what he knew to be otherwise, that the military means of France were nearly null ; that he was well acquainted with the points where an invading force might enter, and that he would himself lead the hostile armies into the heart of the country. The As sembly winked at this generous bravado, and threw the whole blame on Bouille, who had nothing to fear, for he was already abroad.\" Amid all these stormy scenes, it was decreed by the Assembly that the remains of Voltaire, which had lain for thirteen years in the obscure Abbey of Scellieres, in Champagne, should be brought with marked honors to the Pantheon in Paris. His coffin was received with great pomp at the barriers, and conveyed to a pedestal which had been erected upon the ancient site of the Bastile. Voltaire had been once imprisoned in that fortress, and the pedestal prepared for his casket was formed from the foundation stones of that symbol of despotism. Upon these stones there were now engraved the words : \" Receive on this spot, where despotism once fettered thee, the honors decreed thee by thy country \""], [366, "308 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. After the remains of Voltaire had laid in state for many hours upon the site of the Bastile, his coffin was placed in a magnificent sarcophagus, and lifted upon a richly mounted car drawn by twelve white horses, gor geously caparisoned, and led by postilions dressed in antique attire. The members of the National Assem bly and municipal authorities of Paris surrounded the funeral car, while an immense body of cavalry headed the procession. Muffled drums and funereal requiems mingled with the booming of cannon from adjacent heights. Arches garlanded with flowers spanned the streets. Young girls robed in white scattered roses in the path of the splendid car, and scholars, laborers, artists, and actors took part in the solemn pageant. It was ten o'clock at night before the imposing proces sion reached the Pantheon, and the gleam of flaring torches, and the silver light of the moon, lent enchant ment to the scene. The coffin was deposited between the remains of Descartes and Mirabeau. \"It was the pen of Voltaire which overthrew despotism in France. It was also the pen of Voltaire which banished for so long from human hearts thoughts of God and of future respon sibility. Thus there sprang up in the place of the despotism he had overthrown, another despotism a thou sand-fold more terrible. With consummate genius and utter destitution of all moral principle, he was the demon of destruction, sweeping the good and the bad alike into indiscriminate ruin. The genius of Voltaire induced France to attempt to establish liberty without religion.\" -1 The terrific result will remain a solemn warning to all nations. \" The Republican Party now began to appear. The struggle which lay at first between the Assembly and 1 J. S. C. Abbott."], [367, "309 MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. the Court, then between the Constitutionalists and the Aristocrats, was now about to commence between the Constitutionalists and the Republicans.\" The Jacobin Club had drawn up a petition to the Assembly, demand ing the deposition of the king as a perjured traitor. An immense altar was erected in the Field of Mars, and here on the 17th of July, 1791, the multitudes gathered to the number of an hundred thousand. Two men dis covered hiding under the platform of the altar had been seized by the mob under the plea that they were placed there by the aristocrats in order to blow up the altar with gunpowder ; they were speedily torn to pieces by the in furiated populace. The following declaration of the Jacobin Club had been written upon several sheets of paper, and placed upon the altar, and the people to the number of six thousand affixed to it their signatures. This Jacobin mandate read as follows : \u2014 \" Representatives of the people ! your labors are nearly ended. A great crime has been committed. Louis has fled, abandoning his post. The country is on the verge of ruin. The king has been arrested, brought back to Paris, and the people demand that he be tried. You declare that he shall be king. The people do not wish it, and therefore annul your decree. The king has been carried off by two hundred and ninety-two aristocrats, who have themselves declared that they have no longer a voice in the National Assembly. Your decree is annulled because it is in opposition to the voice of the people, your sovereign. Repeal it. The king has abdi cated by crime. Receive his abdication ! \" This arrogant petition of the Jacobins to the Assembly was a usurpation of authority by the mob. \" And so this ' Scroll of a petition,' drawn up by Brissots, Dantons, by Cordeliers, Jacobins, \u2014 for the thing was infinitely"], [368, "310 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. shaken and manipulated, and many had a hand in it ; such scroll lies now visible on the wooden framework of the Fatherland's Altar for signature. Unworking Paris, male and female, is crowding thither all day to sign or to see.\" ' But Constitutional La Fayette and Mayor Bailly, look ing on with an august Assembly which has already declared that the king was carried off, and therefore blameless, lending them the sanction of the law, must dispel in some manner this riotous gathering in the Champ de Mars, else will all Paris soon blaze in wild tumult. What shall be done ? Now verily is the mo ment to inaugurate the authority of the red flag of the law of order, before decreed by the Assembly to be of possible persuasive power; if not entirely by itself, then must bullet and gunpowder make it effective. La Fayette collects his Guards, and Bailly bears aloft the ominous Drapeau Rouge. And in grim procession they march to the Champ de Mars, and will try what efficacy there in them lies to quell seditious mobs who gather, defying law and order. The potent sanguinary flag, as it waves over the entrance to the Fields of Mars, is greeted with jeers of derision. Manifestly the Drapeau Rouge does not possess in itself alone sufficient persuasion ; even though Bailly wave it ever so vigorously in the face of that defiant crowd. Plainly some more forceful meas ures must be taken. The compelling powder must doubtless be employed ; but La Fayette with his humane heart hesitates to fire on the mob, so muskets are lev elled in the air,' and the harmless volleys roll upward towards the clouds ; and the sneering populace laugh at this useless display. Laugh not so loudly, O ye scorn ful anarchists ! Law and order will conquer ; if not by 1 Carlyle."], [369, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 311 red flags and pistols in the air, then with deadly shot and shells shall thy arrogant defiance be laid low. Once again the muskets are levelled ; La Fayette's humanity being overruled by military laws, the \"Volley-fire of Patrollotism \" is this time effective, and the \" Federation Field is wetted with French blood.\" Anarchists must be subdued, else all governments were at an end, and the blood of the rebellious must sometimes be spilt to save the lives of true patriots. Thus was the altar of anarchy destroyed, and its votaries fly shrieking from the field; thus was this sham of Federation demolished, and the Federation of the Constitution vindicated. Humanity to mobs often proves to be inhumanity to mankind. Both the National Assembly and the munici pality of Paris voted their cordial approval of the meas ures taken by La Fayette and Bailly upon this occasion, but the Jacobin press gave utterance to the fiercest invectives. Let us look for one moment into one of the private salons in Paris, where many of the most illustrious men and women of France are gathered at an evening party. A young officer is introduced into this brilliant assembly by the Abbe Raynal. His appearance attracts every eye, and his remarkable conversation soon rivets the attention of all within hearing of his voice. The Bishop of Autun is speaking, and is commending the conduct of some sol diers for having refused to obey their officers, who had commanded them to fire, in order to disperse a mob. \"Excuse me, my lord,\" courteously exclaimed the young officer, in tones of earnestness which arrested the hearers, \" if I venture to interrupt you ; but, as I am an officer, I must claim the privilege of expressing my sentiments. It is true that I am young, and it may appear presump tuous in me to address so many distinguished men ; but"], [370, "312 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. during the past three years I have paid intense attention to our political troubles. I see with sorrow the state of our country, and I will incur censure rather than pass unnoticed principles which are not only unsound, but which are subversive of all government. As much as any I desire to see all abuses, antiquated privileges, and usurped rights annulled. Nay, as I am at the commence ment of my career, it will be my best policy, as well as my duty, to support the progress of popular institutions, and to promote reform in every branch of the public administration. But as, in the last twelve months, I have witnessed repeated alarming popular disturbances, and have seen our best men divided into factions which threaten to be irreconcilable, I sincerely believe that now, more than ever, a strict discipline in the army is absolutely necessary for the safety of our constitutional government and for the maintenance of order. Nay, if our troops are not compelled unhesitatingly to obey the commands of the executive, we shall be exposed to the blind fury of democratic passions which will render France the most miserable country on the globe. The ministry may be assured that if the daily increasing arrogance of the Parisian mob is not repressed by a strong arm, and social order rightly maintained, we shall see not only this capi tal, but every other city in France, thrown into a state of indescribable anarchy, while the real friends of liberty, the enlightened patriots now working for the best good of our country, will sink beneath a set of demagogues who, with louder cries for freedom on their tongues, will be in reality but a horde of savages, worse than the Neros of old. I frankly declare, that if I were compelled to choose between the old monarchy and Jacobin misrule, I should infinitely prefer the former.\""], [371, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 313 \" Who is that young man,\" inquired one of the aristo cratic guests of the Abb6 Raynal. \"He is a protege of mine,\" replied the Abbe, \"and he is a young man of extraordinary talent. His name is Napoleon Bonaparte.\" And well was the young Napoleon's prophecy fulfilled in the awful Reign of Terror. At length the long-expected Constitution is completed. With what a weariness of head and heaviness of heart, let those Constituent Assembly members say. Not only has the Constitution been completed, but it has been bol stered up by after-amendments and after-thoughts, which peradventure may lessen the faults which it plainly pos sesses, but which are ineradicable in this present crisis ; better times may come, when with a quieter nation, and sovereigns not running away, so that they must be guarded in their very bed-chambers, to keep ruling ; and with less riotous Parisian mobs to disturb the thoughtful tran quillity of an august assembly, and with more bread to fill the people's empty stomachs, and more money to fill their empty pockets, a necessary serenity of mind might be vouchsafed to legislators framing constitutions, and thereby more perfect results might be obtained. But let us be thankful that the Constitution, such as it is, is in verity finished, and ready for the acceptation of the king and people. \"The sad Varennes business has been soldered up, cemented, even, in the blood of the Champ-de-Mars, these two months and more; and indeed ever since, as formerly, Majesty has had its privileges, its 'choice of residence,' though, for good reasons, the royal mind ' pre fers continuing in Paris.' Poor royal mind, poor Paris ; that have to go mumming, enveloped in speciosities, in falsehood which knows itself false ; and to enact mutually"], [372, "314 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. your sorrowful farce-tragedy, being bound to it ; and on the whole, to hope always, in spite of hope ! \"Nay, now that his Majesty has accepted the Consti tution, to the sound of cannon-salvoes, who would not hope ? Our good king was misguided, but he meant well. La Fayette has moved for an amnesty, for uni versal forgiving and forgetting of revolutionary faults ; and now, surely, the glorious Revolution, cleared of its rubbish, is complete ! Strange enough, and touching in several ways, the old cry of Vive le Roi ! once more rises round King Louis, the Hereditary Representative. Their Majesties went to the opera, gave money to the poor; the queen herself, now when the Constitution is accepted, hears voice of cheering. Bygone shall be bygone ; the new era shall begin ! To and fro, amid those lamp galaxies of the Elysian Fields, the royal carriage slowly wends and rolls, everywhere with vivats from a multi tude striving to be glad. Louis looks out, mainly on the variegated lamps and gay human groups, with satisfac tion enough for the hour. In her Majesty's face, 'under that kind, graceful smile, a deep sadness is legible.' \" Brilliancies of valor and of wit stroll here observant : a Dame de Stael, leaning, most probably, on the arm of her Narbonne. She meets deputies, who have built this Constitution, who saunter here with vague communings, not without thoughts whether it will stand. But as yet, melodious fiddle-strings twang and warble everywhere, with the rhythm of light-fantastic feet ; long lamp galaxies fling their colored radiance, and brass-lunged hawkers elbow and bawl, ' Grande Acceptation, Constitu tion Monarchique ' ; it behooves the son of Adam to hope.

Much is uncertain, questionable; but if the Hereditary Representative be wise and lucky, may one not, with a sanguine Gaelic temper, hope that he will get in motion better or worse ; that what is wanting to him will gradually be gained and added ? \" l But alas ! when was Louis XVI. ever known to be either ivise or lucky ? And when his lethargic nature gets in motion at last, is it not for the very worst possible result ? Poor Do-nothing Louis !

When thou doest, or doest not, thou art sure to be equally unfortunate ! And so, with this grand palaver, the Con stitution is gotten accepted by the king ; let it now get accepted by the people. To this end the multitude shall assemble in the market-place. La Fayette, on his stately white charger, rides commandingly at the head of his staff, accompanied by the king and queen and the royal children, in the royal carriage. We say La Fayette, accompanied by the king, advisedly, rather than the king escorted by La Fayette ; for, on that day, this thing was evident to the blindest, that the white charger carried more truly the sovereign of the people than the royal carriage. And though hats are tossed enthusiastically in the air, and voices shout, \" Vive le Roi ! Vive la Reine ! Vive le Dauphin ! \" it is to the martial figure of the still popular La Fayette that the eye of admiration is mostly directed.

As a curious instance of the difference of opinion held in France at that time, the following quotations may be cited. Bertrand de Moleville, a warm partisan of the aristocracy, says : * \u2014 \" Thus terminated this guilty Assembly, whose vanity, ambition, cupidity, ingratitude, ignorance, and audacity have overturned the most ancient and the noblest mon archy of Europe, and rendered France the theatre of every crime, of every calamity, and of the most horri ble catastrophe. Can these treacherous representatives ever justify themselves in the eyes of the nation for having so unworthily abused their confidence and their powers ? \" On the other hand, the democratic historians, the \" Two Friends of Liberty,\" while regretting that the Constitution was not more thoroughly democratic, say : \u2014 \" The Constitution of 1791, with all its faults, forever deserves the gratitude of the French people, because it has destroyed, never to return, every trace of feudalism, imposts the most fatal to agriculture, the privileges of particular persons, the usurpations of the priesthood over the civil power, and the proud pretensions of ancient corporations; because it has realized what philosophy for ages has in vain wished, and what monarchs the most absolute have never dared to undertake; and be cause it has established that uniformity which no one could have ever hoped for in an empire formed by gradual accretions from time to time, and with which, under a good government, there is no prosperity which France may not realize.\" In view of such diverse statements, we are forced to"], [375, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 317 exclaim, What, after all, is fame ? A tiny spark, which an enemy may blow into a blaze of scandal which the most eulogistical encomiums of friends will fail to quench. Let us listen to this royal conversation, reported by Bertrand de Molleville, the Royalist, who had been ap pointed by Louis Minister of Marine. Louis says, speak ing to Bertrand in his cabinet, \" In my opinion, the Constitution has serious defects ; and, if I had been at liberty to address some observations to the Assembly, very beneficial reforms might have resulted from them. But now it is too late ; and I have accepted it, such as it is. I have sworn to cause it to be executed ; and I ought to be, and will be, strictly faithful to my oath.\" Louis ! Let us thank your destiny that you were pre vented from proposing your reforms to the Assembly ; for, had it been otherwise, when till doomsday would the Constitution have been completed, with your vacillating amendments ? And we will think you intend to be faithful to your oath ; but we have learned by experi ence that your intentions are not your actions ! But we will let Bertrand, the Minister of Marine, answer his Majesty. \" May I be permitted to ask your Royal Highness if the queen's opinion on this point agrees with the king's ? \" \" Most assuredly,\" responded Louis. \" She will tell you so herself.\" Whereupon Bertrand descended the stairs, and entered her Majesty's apartments ; and the queen, after declaring with her gentle kindness the obligations of royalty to the Minister, said, \" The king has acquainted you with his intentions relative to the Constitution. Do you think that the only plan he has to follow is to adhere to his oath ? \""], [376, "318 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" Most certainly, madame ! \" replied Bertrand. \" Well, then,\" said the queen, \" be assured that noth ing shall induce us to change. Come, M. Bertrand, courage ! I hope that, with patience, firmness, and per severance, all is not yet lost ! \" Poor Marie Antoinette ! Though thy patience and firmness and heroic perseverance shall yet exceed that of all other women in history, it will avail thee nothing ! All is even now lost ! Let us glance at two pictures. It is in the Assembly ; a gilded chair remains vacant beside that of the presi dent of the Legislative Assembly. It is the seat of honor for the king, when he deigns to favor the members with his august presence. But respect for royalty is on the wane. \"Let this scandalous gilded chair be removed,\" said one in the Assembly. \"Let an equality exist between us and the king, as regards ceremony. When he is un covered and standing, let us stand and uncover our heads. When he is covered and seated, let us sit and wear our hats.\" The proposal met with favor. Already decrees had been passed abolishing the titles of \" Sire,\" and \" Tour Majesty,\" leaving the king no other title than the King of the French. Unaware of the removal of the gilded chair, Louis visited the Assembly. He was received with applause, and cries of \" Vive le Roi!\" But to his great horror, while he addressed the Assembly, the members remained seated ; and when he sat covered, they retained their hats. This insult broke the heart of Louis. The queen, who had attended the sitting in a private box, was a witness of his humiliation. Upon leaving the Assembly and returning to the pal-"], [377, "319 MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. ace, the king hastened to the apartment of the queen, pale and agitated. \" All is lost ! Ah, madame ! and you are a witness to this humiliation. What ! you are come to France to see \u2014 \" Sobs choked his utterance. The queen threw herself upon her knees before him, and pressed him in her arms. \" I remained with them,\" writes Madame Campan, \"not from any blamable curiosity, but from a stupefaction which rendered me incapable of determining what I ought to do. The queen said to me, ' Oh, go, go ! ' with an accent which expressed, ' Do not remain to witness the dejection and despair of your sovereign.' I withdrew, struck with the contrast between the shouts of joy without the palace and the profound grief -which oppressed the sovereigns within.\" The other scene was at the opera. Deeming it impor tant that the king and queen should appear contented in the eyes of the populace, Marie Antoinette had been per suaded to attend a performance at the Theatre Italien. It was the 10th of October, 1791 ; and in the Theatre Italien they were giving Gluck's Opera, a favorite of the queen, the opera in which, a few years before, she had re ceived so splendid a triumph, in which the public had so loudly encored, \" Chansons, cilebrons notre reine!\" which the chorus had sung upon the stage, and, standing with their faces turned toward the royal box, had mingled their voices with those of the singers, and repeated in general chorus, \" Chansons, cilebrons notre reine ! \" \" I will try whether the public remembers that even ing,\" said Marie Antoinette, with a faint smile, to Mademoiselle de Bugois. \" I will go this evening to the opera. The public shall at least see that I intrust my self with confidence to it, and that I have not changed, however much may have changed around me.\""], [378, "320 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The news that the queen was to appear that evening ran quickly through all Paris. The officer on duty told it to the guards, they to those whom they met ; and it spread like wildfire. Long before the curtain was raised, the great opera-house was completely filled \u2014 parquette, boxes, and parterre \u2014 with a passionately excited throng. The friends of the queen were there to give her a long looked-for triumph ; her enemies to hurl their hate, their malice, and their scorn into the face of Marie Antoinette. And these latter, of whom the queen had, unfortunately, overwhelming numbers, had taken their places in every part of the house. And in the boxes, upon those velvet cushioned chairs of the haute noblesse, now sat the mem bers of the Jacobin clubs. Above, in the box where the public had been wont to see the fair face of the Princesse de Lamballe, a man's head appeared. This man was Marat, once doctor to the grooms in the Comte d'Artois's stable, now the most formidable orator of the wild Jacobins. He, too, had come to see the hated \" she-wolf,\" as he had lately styled the queen, in his \" Ami-du-Peuple,\" and, drunk with vanity, sat in the splendid box of the Princesse de Lamballe. \" At length the time arrived for the opera to begin ; and although the queen had not yet come, the director of the orchestra did not venture to detain the audience even for a few moments. He took his place, and the overture began. All was silent in parquette and par terre as well as in the boxes. Every one seemed to be listening only to the music, equally full of sweetness and majesty ; only to have ears for the noble rhythm with which Gluck begins his famous masterpiece. Sud denly there arose a dull, suppressed sound in parquette, parterre, and boxes, and all heads which had before been"], [379, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 321 directed toward the stage were now turned backward toward the royal box. \" No one paid any more attention to the music ; no one noticed that the overture had ended, and that the curtain was raised. \" Amidst the blast of trumpets, the noise of violins and clarionets, the public had heard the light noise of open ing doors, and had noticed the entrance of the officers, and this sound had made the Parisians forget even their much-loved music.\" And now the queen, followed by Mademoiselle de Bugois, advanced slowly through the great box to the very front. All eyes were directed to her, all looks searched her noble face. With a smile and a deep blush Marie Antoinette bowed and saluted the audience. A loud cry of applause resounded through the theatre. In the parquette and in the boxes hundreds of spectators rose and hailed her with shouts of \" Vive la Reine ! \" Suddenly the applause was overborne by loud whistling, shouting, and derisive laughter. \" The civil war has begun,\" cried Marat, rubbing his hands together with delight. The royalists continued to applaud and to shout, \" Vive la Reine!\" Their opponents tried to silence them by their hisses and laughter. But finally the disturbance was quelled, and the opera went on. The people again appeared to have given themselves to the enjoyment of the music ; but the quiet was soon to be disturbed again. As Madame Dugazont sang the words, \" Ah ! how I love my queen, how I love my mistress ! \" she advanced close to the footlights, and turning her eyes toward the royal box, bowed low in graceful salutation. And now, as if this had been the battle-cry of a new"], [380, "322 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. contest, a fearful din, a raging torrent of sound, began through the whole house. At first it was a confused mass of cries, roars, hisses, and applause. Now and then single voices could be heard above the horrid chaos of sounds. \"We want no queen!\" some shouted. \"We want no mistress ! \" \" Liberty ! \" And mingled with these was the contrary cry, \" Long live our mistress ! Long live our queen ! \" \" Hi ! \" yelled Marat, twisting his bony form into all kinds of knots. \" The people of Paris are right. We want no queen ! And more than all other things, we want no mistress. Only slaves ac knowledge masters over them. If the Dugazont ven tures to sing again ' I love my queen, I love my mistress,' she will be punished as slaves are punished, \u2014 that is, she will be flogged.\" \" Bravo, Marat, bravo ! \" roared Santerre, with his savage rabble. \" Bravo, Marat, bravo ! She shall be flogged ! \" Marat bowed on all sides, and turned his eyes, gleam ing with scorn and hatred, toward the royal box. \"But not alone shall the singer be flogged,\" he cried in a louder voice ; \" no, not alone shall the singer be flogged, but greater punishment have they deserved who urge on such deeds. If the Austrian womah comes here again to turn the heads of sympathizing souls with her martyr looks, if she undertakes again to move us with her tears, we will serve her as she deserves ; we will go whip in hand into her box.\" The queen rose from her chair like an exasperated lioness, and advanced to the front of the box. Standing erect with flashing eyes and purple cheeks, she confronted them there, \u2014 the true daughter of the C\u00e6sars, \u2014 and had already opened her lips to speak and overwhelm the traitor with her wrath, when another voice was heard giving answer to Marat."], [381, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 323 \"Be silent, Marat,\" it cried, \"be silent. Whoever dares to insult a woman, be she queen or beggar, dis honors himself, his mother, and his wife. I call on you all to take the part of a defenceless woman whom Marat ventures mortally to insult. You all have mothers and wives ; you may, perhaps, have daughters. Defend the honor of the woman. Do not permit it to be degraded in your presence. Join with me now in the cry, ' Long live our queen ! Long live Marie Antoinette ! ' \" And the public, carried away with the enthusiasm of this young and handsome man who had risen in his box, and whose slender, proud figure towered above all, \u2014 the public broke into one united, stirring cry: \"Long live our queen ! Long live Marie Antoinette ! \" Marat, trembling with rage, sank back in his chair. \" I knew very well that Barnave was a traitor,\" he muttered. \" I shall remember this moment, and Barnave shall one day atone for it with his head.\" \" It is Barnave,\" whispered the queen to Mademoiselle de Bugois. \"He has rescued me from a great danger, for I was on the point of being carried away by my wrath, and answering that monster there as he deserves.\" And while the public were still crying, \" Long live the queen,\" Marie Antoinette left the box, entered her car riage, and returned to the Tuileries. Never again did she venture to attend the theatre. This afflicted .queen was rapidly learning how nearly all things were even then lost. Louis was holding a royal levie in the Tuileries. The Duke of Orleans, though hated at court, thought it policy to attend. But much he rued this unlucky plan. When he arrived at the palace, the courtiers who thronged the king's ante-chambers trod on his toes, punched him with their elbows, and cried to one another, \" Gentlemen,"], [382, "324 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. watch the dishes ! \" implying that the duke was pro vided with poison to sprinkle upon the food. Finding it impossible to obtain an audience with the king, the duke withdrew, impressed with the idea that these in sults were known to Louis and Marie Antoinette, of which, however, they were entirely ignorant, and upon learning of them afterwards they were both deeply chagrined. The duke took his fearful revenge later, when his hour of power came : he voted to send the king to the scaffold. Marie Antoinette appealed to her brother, Leopold of Austria, for assistance. \"The king of Prussia,\" she wrote, \" for a mere incivility offered to his sister, sent an army into Holland to punish the affront. And will the emperor of Austria patiently suffer insults and affronts to be heaped upon his sister, \u2014 the queen of France, \u2014 the degradation of her rank and dignity, and the overthrow of the throne of a king who is his brother in-law and his ally ? \" Thus pressed, the Austrian cabinet returned the follow ing answer : \u2014 \" When France gave to Europe the spectacle of a law ful king forced by atrocious violence to fly, protesting solemnly against the acquiescence which they had ex torted from him, and a little afterward stopped and detained a prisoner by his subjects, \u2014 yes, it then did concern the brother-in-law and the ally of the king to invite the other powers of Europe to join with him in a declaration to France that they all view the cause of his most Christian Majesty as their own ; that they demand that this prince and his family be set at liberty and have power to go where they please ; and they require for these royal personages inviolability and due respect which, by the law of nature and nations, are due from"], [383, "MIRABEAU AND VARENNES. 325 subjects to their princes ; that they will unite to avenge in the most signal manner every further attempt that may be committed, or may be suffered to be committed, against the liberty, the honor, and the safety of the king, the queen, and the royal family. And that, finally, they will not acknowledge as constitutional and legally estab lished in France any laws but those which shall have the voluntary acquiescence of the king, enjoying perfect liberty. But if, on the other hand, these demands are not complied with, they will in concert employ all the means in their reach to put a stop to the scandalous usurpation of power which bears the appearance of an open rebellion, and which, from the dangers of the example, it concerns all the governments of Europe to repress.\" On the first of March, 1792, Emperor Leopold died, and was succeeded by his son, Francis II. , then twenty four years of age. Twenty-nine days after the death of Leopold, Gustavus III. of Sweden was assassinated. Thus were the two most powerful allies of the French court stricken down. \" Extremely rheumatic Constitutions have been known to march, and keep on their feet, though in a staggering, sprawling manner, for long periods, in virtue of one thing only, that the Head were healthy. But this Head of the French Constitution ! What King Louis is and can not help being, readers already know.

For a few months, in the early stages of the Revolution, she poses in graceful recline upon salon sofas, surrounded by Parisian admirers. But prisons and guillotines are not an agreeable background for pos ing professional beauties; and she speedily flits away beyond the frontier, where she may be sure her lovely head will remain poised upon her own swan-like neck, rather than be borne aloft upon the executioner's bloody pike. In revolutions pretty faces alone will not suffice for the achieving of a heroine's fame. A heart full of courage, a head full of brains, and a soul inspired with lofty self-sacrifice are needed. So Madame Recaniier, who desires not the fame of a martyr, hies thitherward, and bides her time. She will reappear before the curtain is finally rung down upon the last scene of the bloody drama of the French Revolution ; but you may be sure it will not be while there are any red guillotines or ominous prisons in the background. She will return opportunely for her place in history, while the brilliant consulate is rising on the ruins of the dead rejmblic ; and she will achieve the glory of attracting the attention of the Premier Consul, who exclaimed at a certain dinner-party, where she was present in all her surpassing loveliness, \" Who is that very beautiful woman ? \" Thus did she obtain the fame of beauty which common mortals seem to prefer to the more painful fame of martyrdom.

AT this critical time Louis was taken with one of his spasmodic fits of unfortunate action. He vetoed the decrees relative to priests who refused to take the civic act; he opposed the formation of the Camp of twenty thousand near Paris, for the protection of the city against foreign invasion ; and he dismissed his popular ministers. The dismissal of the three ministers, Roland, Servan, and Clavieres, was in consequence of a letter said to have been written by Madame Roland, and presented by M. Roland, the Minister of the Interior, to the king. This letter urged Louis to sanction the decrees, and described the peril to which the king exposed himself by opposing the establishment of constitutional liberty in France. The indignation of the king was aroused by the plain truths conveyed in the letter, and he immediately dis missed the three ministers. This action bitterly offended the Assembly, and helped to fan the flame of fury already hourly increasing in Paris. The famous letter was printed, and sent, into the eighty-three departments of France ; and a vote was passed declaring that the three dismissed ministers retained the confidence of the nation. Thus had blundering Louis destroyed the remnant of the renewed popularity which the acceptation of the Consti tution had for a brief space given him. From this time neither the king nor queen could appear at the windows of the palace, without being exposed to the most brutal insults from the crowds which daily thronged the walks of the gardens. It was the 20th of June ; there was an immense gath ering of people in Paris to celebrate the memorable Oath of the Tennis-Court, and to present a petition to the king, urging him to withdraw his vetoes. Santerre, the brewer, was the leader of the multitude, which, as the hours ad vanced, became ominously a mob. The Assembly received"], [391, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 331 a letter from Santerre, begging to be admitted to the bar of the Assembly, with the delegates of the people, that they might prove their innocence of any sinister motives in thus gathering to celebrate the anniversary of the 20th of June. Even as the letter was handed, the petitioners were at the door ; and the Assembly were forced to sub mit for three hours, to the defiant uproar of the enor mous procession as it filed slowly through the hall, sing ing the notorious \" Ca Ira,\" and bearing many revolting and insulting revolutionary devices. Some bore large tables upon which were placed the Declaration of Rights, and around them danced women and boys, waving olive branches and brandishing pikes, emblematic of peace or war, as the spirit of the times should be made manifest. Ragged breeches were carried upon long poles, while the excited crowds shouted, \" Vivent les sans culottes ! \" One man bore a calf's heart on the point of a pike, with the inscription beneath, \" The heart of an Aristocrat ! \" One woman held aloft a representation of a gibbet, to which a dirty doll was suspended, and the words \" Marie Antoinette d la lanterne\" were written beneath. Another person \"carried a board to which a bullock's heart was fastened, with an inscription around it, \" Heart of Louis XVI.\" The mob having passed through the hall of the Assem bly, approached the Tuileries. The gates were closed and defended by detachments of the National Guard. \" Doivn with the veto!\" shouted the furious populace. The king, hoping to allay the fury of the mob, ordered the garden gates to be opened. The ragged, filthy swarms of the dregs of the faubourgs rushed in, and soon the vast enclosure was one eddying mass of excited people. A strong guard refused them admittance at the royal gate of the palace ; but Santerre brought up two pieces"], [392, "332 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. of cannon to blow up the gate, when the municipal officers ordered the gates to be thrown open. Impetu ously rushed the hordes of wild creatures into the court. Now they crowded into the vestibule of the grand en trance. Up the magnificent staircase they clambered, dragging a piece of cannon to the first floor, and from thence they spread themselves like a living deluge through the palace. Swords and hatchets speedily broke down barred doors; and at length in one of the inner apartments, the king at last faced this menacing mass of human beings. \" No veto ! no priests ! no aristocrats ! the camp near Paris ! \" demanded the mob in thunder tones, accompanied with coarse jests and insulting lan guage. For once Louis aroused himself to the situation. Standing upon a bench, protected by a table placed in front of him, and surrounded by a few servants of his household and officers of the National Guard, he met the threatening crowd with a look of brave defiance. Le gendre, a butcher, stepped up to him and demanded, in the name of the people, the sanction of the two decrees which the king had vetoed. \" This is not the place, neither is this the time,\" replied Louis calmly, \" to grant such a request. I will do all that the Constitution requires.\" This bold answer pleased and yet exasperated the mob ; and they cried, \" Vive la Nation ! \" \" Yes,\" replied the king ; \" Vive la Nation ! and I am its best friend.\" \" Prove it ! \" exclaimed a man, thrusting towards Louis the red cap of the Jacobins, on the end of a pike. The king took the cap and placed it on his head. A drunken fellow, staggering up to the king, holding a bottle and a tumbler, offered him a glass of wine, saying, \" If you love the people, drink to their health.\""], [393, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 333 Though Louis had long been apprehensive of being poisoned, he took the goblet, and without hesitation drank its contents. This act was greeted with applause. \" Sire, do not fear,\" said one of Louis' grenadiers beside him ; \" we will protect you.\" \"Do you think I fear?\" answered the king. \"Place your hand upon my heart. You will find no quick beat ings of fear there.\" Brave Louis ! Would that you were as great to act as you are to endure ! All things had then fared so dif ferently, and, peradventure, your own head would have escaped the guillotine. The queen had been prevented by the crowds from reaching the apartment of the king ; but his sister Eliza beth, being in the room, some of the people cried out, \" There is the Austrian woman ! \" \" Let them think I am the queen,\" said self-sacrificing Elizabeth. \" Perhaps it will save her life.\" Meanwhile Marie Antoinette, with her daughter and the young dauphin, had been crowded into one corner of the council-chamber. Some of the palace guard gathered round the royal group to protect them, if possible, from injury, though they could not protect them from gross insults. Her friends had rolled the council-table before her to serve as a barricade, and the dauphin was seated upon it. One of the crowd handed the little prince a red Jacobin cap, and the queen, hoping to appease the fury of the rioters, placed it on her son's head. A woman stopped before Marie Antoinette, and abused her with a volley of coarse imprecations. \" Have I ever done you any wrong ? \" asked the queen, in gentle tones. \"No; but you are the cause of the misery of the nation.\""], [394, "334 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" You have been told so,\" kindly replied the queen ; \"but you are deceived. As the wife of the king of France, and mother of the dauphin, I am a Frenchwoman. I shall never see my own country again. I can be happy only in France. I was happy when you loved me,\" she concluded with touching pathos. The young woman was moved to tears, \"I ask your pardon. It was because I did not know you. I see that you are good,\" she said, weeping. Ah ! the people did not know the kind-hearted, coura geous Marie Antoinette. There was the terrible mistake. It was a series of mistakes, and this awful day was in some measure the result of a previous mistake of Marie Antoinette. Upon the completion of the Constitution, La Fayette had resigned his command of the National Guards, and Bailly had resigned his post as mayor of Paris. A new mayor had to be chosen. The Constitu tionalists were in favor of La Fayette, but the Jacobin faction nominated Petion, \u2014 the same Pdtion who had so grossly insulted the royal fugitives as they were on the road back to Paris from the fatal flight to Varennes. It was Marie Antoinette's influence with the court which turned the scale in Petion's favor. With great blindness the queen failed to appreciate La Fayette's loyalty to the king, and she had taken a strong dislike to the chivalrous general, as she looked upon him only as their former jailer. \" The Marquis de La Fayette,\" said the queen, \" only desires to be mayor of Paris, that he may be Mayor of the Palace. Potion is a Jacobin and republican; but he is a fool, incapable of ever being the leader of a party. He will be a nullity of a mayor. Besides, it is possible that the knowledge of the interest we take in his election may bring him over to the king.\""], [395, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 335 Poor Marie Antoinette ! how grievously have you been mistaken! Would La Fayette as mayor have allowed this mob in the palace of his king? This has Petion done knowingly, yes, purposely, as some think; and it is five o'clock in the afternoon of that dreadful day before the mayor of Paris makes his tardy appearance, and having mounted an arm-chair, addresses the mob, and says to them, that after laying its remonstrances before the king, it has nothing further to do but to retire peace ably, and in such manner as not to sully the day. Sully the day, indeed ! was it not already foully sullied by this insulting mob in the palace of its king ? Some assert also, that Potion said their just remonstrances. Well, whether just or not, was hardly the question; it was the manner of the remonstrance, which could be called naught but the outburst of anarchy. When the rabble retired, it was seven o'clock in the evening. Thus had the anniversary of the Oath of the Ten nis-Court been celebrated. The first was the noble action of a righteous uprising against despotism ; the other was a disgraceful exhibition of the wild license of anarchy. There was a sad scene in the palace that night. The royal family assembled and embraced, thankful that their lives were spared. Too sick at heart even to display indignation; with the exception of the unusual excitement of the stolid Louis as he flung away in horrified disgust the red cap, which he had unwittingly allowed to remain upon his head ; and the keen vexation of the queen as she pointed out the broken doors and shattered furniture to the deputies, who had just arrived at the palace. Merlin de Thionville, a stanch republican, was one of these deputies, and at the sight of these outrages the tears came to his eyes. \"You weep,\" said the queen, perceiving his emotion,"], [396, "336 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \"to see the king and his family treated so cruelly by a people whom he has always wished to render happy.\" \" It is true, Madame,\" replied the unflinching republi can, \"that I weep; but it is for the misfortunes of a beautiful, tender-hearted woman and mother of a family : but do not mistake; there is not one of my tears for the King or the Queen; I hate kings and queens.\" \"Thus has the Age of Chivalry gone, and that of Hunger come. Thus does all-needing Sansculottism look in the face of its Roi, Regulator, King or Able-man ; and find that he has nothing to give it. Thus do the two parties, brought face to face after long centuries, stare stupidly at one another, \u2014 This, verily, am I; but, good heaven, is that Thou ? \u2014 and depart, not knowing what to make of it. And yet, Incongruities having recognized themselves to be incongruous, something must be made of it. This is the world-famous Twentieth of June, more worthy to be called the Procession of the Black Breeches!\"1 And something shall indeed be made of it. A guillo tine and a Republic ! But in the making of it what blood-curdling horrors ! What wailing woes ! As the mob surged and swayed around the Tuileries, on this 20th of June, Bourrienne and Napoleon Bonaparte met in a coffee-room in the Rue Saint Honore. Observing the unusual concourse of people in the streets, they went out and followed the crowd to the Tuileries. Bourienne thus describes their adventure : \u2014 \"'Let us follow that rabble,' said Bonaparte to me. We got before them, and went to walk in the gardens, on the terrace overlooking the water. From this station he beheld the disgraceful occurrences that ensued. I should fail in attempting to depict the surprise and 1 Carlyle."], [397, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 337 indignation roused within him. He could not compre hend such weakness and forbearance. But when the king showed himself at one of the windows fronting the garden, with the red cap which one of the mob had just placed on his head, Bonaparte could no longer restrain his indignation. ' What madness ! ' exclaimed he ; ' how could they allow these scoundrels to enter? They ought to have blown four or five hundred of them into the air with a cannon. The rest would then have taken to their heels.'\" And well did Napoleon prove the wisdom of his remarks in dealing with anarchists, when he himself came to face a mob, in defence of the Convention, and law and order. The day after the disgraceful scenes at the Tuileries, crowds again began to assemble in various parts of Paris, but were soon dispelled by Mayor Potion. Towards even ing he hastened to the king, to assure him that all things were tranquil. \" Sire, there is no longer cause for alarm,\" he said to Louis ; \" order is restored, and the people have become quiet and satisfied.\" The king, justly exasperated by the events of the pre ceding day, replied with suppressed emotion, \" That is not true.\" \" Sire \u2014 \" rejoined Petion. \" Be silent ! \" said angry Louis. Potion, who, however, was not thus easily put out of countenance, ventured to say, \" It befits not the magis trate of the people to be silent when he does his duty and speaks the truth.\" \"The tranquillity of Paris rests on your head,\" said the king. \"I know my duty, and shall perform it,\" defiantly answered Petion. Louis was now vexed beyond control, and he excitedly exclaimed, \" Enough ; go and perform it. Retire ! \""], [398, "338 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. And P-etion retired, rather crestfallen at this recep tion, which he well deserved for his culpable negligence of the day before. The report of this angry interview soon spread through out Paris. It added fuel to the flames. \" It was rumored through the palace, that the mob were preparing to rise and murder the king and all the royal family. It was rumored through the street that the royalists were endeavoring to provoke the people to rise, that they might shoot them down with artillery. The mayor issued a proclamation urging the people not to allow themselves to be excited to fresh commotions. The king issued a proclamation, spirited and defiant in its tone, and yet calculated only to exasperate those whom he had no power to restrain.\" 1 La Fayette, upon hearing of the outrage to which the king had been submitted, wrote a brave letter to the Assembly, invoking them to take measures against the fast increasing power of the Jacobins ; and as this letter occasioned only a storm of abuse from those opposed to him, he speedily returned to Paris and boldly entered the Assembly, to speak in his own defence. The Con stitutionalists received him with applause, but the republicans and Jacobins were silent. La Fayette's speech before the Assembly occasioned an angry debate. All his efforts to save the king were unavailing. The king and queen received him with great coldness, when he went to the palace, and the courtiers applied to him the most abusive epithets. Such was his reward for attempting to rescue his king, at the risk of his own life. By this act he lost his popularity, and after finding that he could accomplish nothing in behalf of Louis, he returned to his army. From thence he made one more 1 Abbott."], [399, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 339 effort to induce the king to place himself in the protec tion of his troops; but his offers were received with almost insolent refusal. The Marquis de Ferrieres, who was a decided royalist, thus writes concerning this inex plicable blindness of the king and queen regarding the succor proposed to them by La Fayette. \" If the court and the people attached to the king had but resolved to support La Fayette, there was force to have annihi lated the two factions. But the queen recoiled from any idea of owing her safety to a man whom she so dis liked. They refused to enter into his views, and they thus rejected the only means of safety that Providence offered them. The only explanation which can be given of such conduct, is that they were looking towards sup posed relief to be afforded them by approaching foreign troops.\" Both the king and queen were aware that Prussia and Austria had united in their aid, and that the Duke of Brunswick was secretly marching with an army of eighty thousand men, to join the emigrants assembled at Cob lentz. Marie Antoinette was so confident of succor that she informed her ladies that she expected to be rescued in a month. France was now in great peril. Foreign armies were approaching, and the country was divided by furious fac tions. The king was taking no effectual measures for the defence of his kingdom, and had vetoed the decrees of the Assembly for raising an army for the protection of Paris, and was believed to be in sympathy and con stant correspondence with the foreign foe. The only excuse that can be made for Louis was that he was but the tool of others ; but this despicable weakness, which was criminal, though it may gain our contemptuous pity for such a wavering character, becomes a strong argu-"], [400, "340 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ment against the policy of trying to maintain him on his throne. He neither intrigued strategetically, which might have been allowed as a war expedient; nor submitted consistently, which might have gained the hearts of his people ; nor defied boldly, which might have given him admiring followers ; he weakly intrigued, which became criminal duplicity ; he weakly submitted, which became unmanly cowardice ; he weakly defied, which became con temptible bravado. And he also managed to employ each one of these measures just at the very moment when the necessity of the case demanded its exact opposite ; thus complicating everything, and rendering his spasmodic actions as ineffective as his habitual do-nothingness. \" All the great roads were crowded with priests, nobles, and their partisans, hastening to join the emigrants at Coblentz. Couriers were everywhere traversing Europe from St. Petersburg to Rome, from Stockholm to Madrid, from Berlin to Naples, openly announcing the coalition of all Europe to crush the Revolution in France, and declaring that the armies would move in such force that the French would not be able to resist them for a single month. The allies were not unwilling to have their plans known, and even exaggerated ; for some of them hoped that the terror of the threat might be sufficient to drive the French patriots to submission. \"It was consequently proclaimed, not officially, but with great soundings of trumpets, that Spain was to indemnify herself for the war by taking possession of the four beautiful southern provinces of France which lean against the Pyrenees, \u2014 Navarre, Roussillon, Langue doc, and Guienne. The king of Sardinia was to receive the provinces adjacent to his kingdom, whose romantic valleys penetrated the lower Alps, \u2014 Dauphiny, Provence,"], [401, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 341 Lyonnois, and Bretagne. The Stadholder of Holland was to extend his sway over the provinces of Flanders and Picardy. Austria was to grasp the provinces adjoin ing the Rhine, \u2014 Alsace, Lorraine, Champagne. The Swiss were offered Franche Comte' if they would join the coalition. And, finally, England was to regain her old possession of Normandy, and was to seize all the colonial possessions of France in the two Indies.\" x Thus was poor France to be gobbled up by the parties who were professing hypocritically to settle her quarrels for her. A wily fox indeed was this foreign coalition, ready to pounce upon the bone of contention and devour it completely, leaving the original owners to whistle for their share. And surely the palace of the Tuileries had become anything but a bed of roses for the menaced king and queen. It is hard to say which were their greatest enemies, the court and the emigrants, with their for eign allies, or the republicans and Jacobins. Their so called friends with their personal intrigues only used them to gain their own ends, while many of their so called enemies were in reality their best friends. During the month of July the palace was the abode of terror and constant alarms. Madame Campan writes : \"During the whole month I was never once in bed. I always dreaded some night attack. One morning, about one o'clock, footsteps were heard in the ante-room of the queen's chamber, and then a violent struggle and loud outcries, as the groom of the chambers grasped a man who was stealthily approaching with a dagger, appar ently to assassinate the queen. \" ' I begin to fear,' said the queen one day, ' that they will bring the king to a trial. Me they will assassinate. i Hist. Phil, de la Re'v. de Fr. par Ant. Fantin Desodoards."], [402, "342 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. But what will become of our poor children ? If they assassinate me, so much the better ; they will rid me of an existence that is painful.' \"One morning, about four o'clock, near the close of July,\" continues Madame Campan, \" a person came to give me information that the Faubourg St. Antoine was preparing to march against the palace. We knew that at least an hour must elapse before the populace, assem bled upon the site of the Bastile, could reach the Tuil eries. It seemed to me sufficient for the queen's safety that all about her should be awakened. I went softly to her room. She was asleep. I did not awaken her. \"The king had been aroused, and so had Madame Elizabeth, who had gone to him. The queen, yielding to the weight of her griefs, slept till nine o'clock on that day, which was very unusual with her. The king had already been to know whether she was awake. I told him what I had done, and the care I had taken not to disturb her rest. He thanked me, and said, 'I was awake, and so was the whole palace. She ran no risk. I am very glad to see her take a little rest. Alas ! her griefs double mine.' \"What was my chagrin when the queen, awaking and learning what had passed, began to weep bitterly from regret at not having been called. In vain did I reiterate that it was a false alarm, and that she required to have her strength recruited. ' My strength is not exhausted,' she said; 'misfortune gives us additional strength. Eliza beth was with the king, and I was asleep. I who am determined to perish by his side. I am his wife. I will not suffer him to incur the smallest risk without my sharing it.' \" Marie Antoinette seems to have understood the char acter of Louis XVI. She said to Madame Campan,"], [403, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 343 regarding him : \" The king is not a coward. He pos sesses abundance of passive courage, but he is over whelmed by an awkward shyness, a mistrust of himself, which proceeds from his education as much as from his disposition. He is afraid to command, and above all things, dreads speaking to assembled numbers. He lived like a child, and always ill at ease, under the eyes of Louis XV. until the age of twenty-one. This constraint confirmed his timidity. Circumstanced as we are, a few well-delivered words addressed to the Parisians, who are devoted to him, would multiply the strength of our party a hundred-fold. He will not utter them. What can we expect from those addresses to the people which he has been obliged to post up ? Nothing but fresh outrages. As for myself, I could do anything, and would appear on horseback, if necessary. But if I were really to begin to act, that would be furnishing arms to the king's ene mies ; the cry against the Austrian and against the sway of a female would become general in France, and, more over, by showing myself I should render the king a mere nothing. A queen who is not regent ought, under these circumstances, to remain passive and prepare to die.\" Pitiful situation! to have the courage of a valiant king, and have to remain passive under the vacillating weakness of a Louis XVI. And on the side of the peo ple, what woes were theirs ! For it was now manifest, whether good-natured Louis meant it or no, that the foe of French liberty, most to be dreaded, was the king and the court. And yet Louis really loved his people, so far as his stolid soul was capable of love. M. Brissot, who had been the stanch friend of La Fayette, felt that he could no longer stand by the king, and from the tribune he gave utterance to these bold words : \u2014 \" Our peril exceeds all that past ages have witnessed."], [404, "344 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The country is in danger, not because we are in want of troops, not because those troops want courage. No ! it is in danger because its force is paralyzed. And who has paralyzed it ? A man \u2014 one man, the man whom the Constitution has made its chief, and whom perfidious advisers have made its foe. You are told to fear the kings of Prussia and Hungary ; I say the chief force of those kings is at the court, and it is there we must first conquer them. They tell you to strike at the dissentient priests. I tell you to strike at the Tuileries, and fell all the priests with a single blow. You are told to perse cute all factious and intriguing conspirators. They will all disappear if you knock loud enough at the door of the Cabinet of the Tuileries ; for that cabinet is the point to which all these threads tend ; where every scheme is plotted, and whence every impulse proceeds. This is the secret of our position ; this is the source of the evil, and here the remedy must be applied.\" Meanwhile, the poor queen and royal children were so often insulted by the crowds of people who thronged the Tuileries garden, that it was determined to close the garden, and all who entered the palace were obliged to produce tickets of admission. Villanous lives of Marie Antoinette, filled with obscene pictures, were sold by the hawkers in the streets ; and even when the gardens had been closed, and the terrace of the Tuileries marked by a tri-colored ribbon, stretched from one end to another, which divided what was called the national ground from that nicknamed by the people the Coblentz ground not even then did the poor queen cease to be tormented by the infuriated populace, who sent forth such terrific howls from the national ground of the terrace, that Marie Antoinette was twice compelled to retire to her apart ments with her children. Mayor P6tion and Procureur"], [405, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 345 Manuel were suspended from their official functions by the king, for their commissions or omissions on the 20th of June ; but on the 13th of July Mayor Petion was re instated by a decree of the Assembly. For, as the 14th was the celebration of the Federation Festival, it was surely necessary to have an active mayor in office, rather than a suspended one, ex-officio. So much did this decree please the patriots, that men wrote on their hats, \" Vive Pition ! \" and some added, \" Pition ou la Mort ! \" The queen fears that the king will be assassinated in the Field of Mars. Madame Campan thereupon prepares a thickly wadded waistcoat, silken covered ; which stands well the test of bullets and even sword-thrusts. But how to get it on the king, is still the question. Louis rebels at such womanish precaution. But Marie Antoinette is steadfast in her purpose that thus the life of her lord shall be secretly protected. Kind Madame Campan wears the heavy waistcoat around for days, as a petti coat, that at the lucky moment when the king can put it on, it may be near at hand, and yet remain a secret. At length the king, one morning, finds a chance to try on the silken armor in the queen's chamber, while the queen is yet in bed, prying valets and waiting-maids being for the moment absent. His majesty reluctantly sub mits to this trying operation, and remarks in a whisper to Madame Campan, so far from the queen's bedside that he may not be overheard: \"It is to satisfy her that I submit to this inconvenience ; they will not assassinate me ; their scheme is changed ; they will put me to death another way.\" The morning of the 14th of July dawned bright and clear ; but the sunshine brought no gladness, and men's faces were sullen, and their looks ominous. This Feder eration Feast was mournful as a funeral wake, and not so"], [406, "346 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. uproarious. Sullen enmity is always the most dangerous. Smothered for awhile, it at last breaks out in all the more terrible conflagration for its long-pent-up smouldering. Madame Campan has secretly prepared a wadded corset for the queen ; but in spite of all her determination that Louis should wear his safety waistcoat, Marie Antoinette is equally determined to guard her life with no such means. Campan's tears and entreaties avail nothing; with a mournful shake of the stately head, the sad-faced queen replies, \"If the rebels assassinate me, it will be a fortunate event.\" The hollow mockery of a Federation Festival proceeded. Nature lowered upon the other Famous Feast, of which this is the anniversary ; but what cared man, though showers wetted him to the skin ? the hearts were happy, and hope was high, and outward discomforts were of little moment. On the succeeding Sunday, July 22d, alarm bells ring, not this time as signal to anarchist mob, but as solemn warning to earnest patriot. A huge flag is fastened on the Pont-Neuf, another is hoisted over the H6tel de Ville ; and as the folds are straightened by the wind, all men may read its portentous inscription : \" Citoyens, la Patrie est en Danger.\" Every patriot's heart thrills, tents are raised in different sections, each municipal in separate tent, with open book, and clerk, and pen and ink ; drums beat and call, and patriots hasten to enroll their names upon the lists of volunteers. Our country is in danger ; let us all go, forget our factions and our quar rels. \" 0 then it seems the very gods might have looked down on such scenes. Young patriotism, Culottic, and Sans-culottic, rushes forward emulous. That is my name ; name, blood, and life is all my country's ; why have I nothing more? Youths of short stature weep"], [407, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 347 that they are below size. Old men come forward, a son in each hand. Mothers themselves will grant their sons. And the multitude bellows Vive la Patrie, far reverberat ing. And fire flashes in the eyes of men ; and at even tide, your Municipal returns to the Townhall, followed by his long train of volunteer valor, hands in his list, says proudly, looking round, 'This is my day's harvest.' They will march on the morrow to Soissons ; small bun dle holding all their chattels. This was the famous day of voluntary enrolment, which in French annals will always be cited with that of the great Federation. This day of enrolment was repeated in all the towns. France thus responded to the Assembly's demand for an army of four hundred and fifty thousand men.\" Meanwhile, what is the Duke of Brunswick doing ? \" Mark how, in these very hours, dated the 25th, Bruns wick 'shakes himself \\_\"s'ibranle \"] in Coblentz, and takes the road ! Shakes himself, indeed ; one spoken word becomes such a shaking. Successive, simultaneous dirl of thirty thousand muskets shouldered ; prance and jingle of ten thousand horsemen, fanfaronading Emigrants in the van ; drum, kettle-drum ; noise of weeping, swearing ; and the immeasurable lumbering clank of baggage wagons and camp-kettles that groan into motion. All this is Brunswick shaking himself ; not without all this does the one man march, 'covering a space of forty miles.' Still less, without his Manifesto, dated, as we say, the 25th, a State-Paper worthy of attention ! \" By this Document, it would seem great things are in store for France. The universal French people shall now have permission to rally round Brunswick and his Emigrant Seigneurs. Tyranny of a Jacobin Faction shall oppress them no more ; but they shall return, and find favor with their own good king, who, by Royal Declara-"], [408, "348 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. tion, 'three years ago,' of the Twenty -third of June, said that he would himself make them happy. As for Na tional Assembly, and other bodies of men invested with some temporary shadow of authority, they are charged to maintain the king's cities and strong places intact, till Brunswick arrives to take delivery of them. Indeed, quick submission may extenuate many things ; but to this end it must be quick. Any National Guard, or other unmilitary person, found resisting in arms, shall be ' treated as a traitor ' ; that is to say, hanged with promptitude. For the rest, if Paris, before Brunswick gets thither, offer any insult to the king, or, for exam ple, suffer a faction to carry the king away elsewhither, in that case, Paris shall be blasted asunder with cannon shot and 'military execution.' Likewise all other cities, which may witness, and not resist to the uttermost, such forced-march of his Majesty, shall be blasted asunder ; and Paris, and every city of them, \u2014 starting-place, course, and goal of said sacrilegious forced-march, \u2014 shall, as rubbish and smoking ruin, lie there for a sign. Such vengeance were indeed signal, ' an insigne vengeance.' \" But while Brunswick blusters and marches, what is Paris doing ? What with being gobbled up by wily Fox of Foreign Alliance, and reduced to ashes by Brunswick's \"military execution,\" France seems to have a poor chance of life. But in spite of Foxes and Brunswicks, Paris is plotting her own schemes. Of things visible we may note Danton, Marat, and Robespierre, at the head of the Jacobin Faction, and the National Assembly forced often to bow its head meekly at their commands, whether or no. Marat makes himself not only visible at times, when he dares creep forth from his cellar hiding-places, but makes himself most powerfully audible also. \" Give me,\" cries this blood-thirsty boaster, \" two"], [409, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 349 hundred Neapolitans, armed with daggers, and bearing on the left arm a muff by way of buckler. With them I will traverse France, and produce a revolution.\" He proposes, also, that the Assembly should force the aris tocrats to wear a white ribbon on the arm; and when three of them are found together, at any time, it should be lawful to kill them. \" Friend of the People,\" indeed ! as he calls himself. Friend of devils rather, and traitor to the people. 0 poor France ! with wily foreign Foxes, death-discoursing Brunswick, and Hades-let-loose Marat, thou art surely in a sad predicament ! Thou thyself shalt be torn to pieces limb from limb, as well as be headed, if help does not soon come to thee ! The royal head is not all that is in danger. Of other things visible in Paris is the arrival of the Marseillais on the 30th of July. Five hundred in number, fiery spirits, summoned by Barbaroux, a native of their city, in response to a request from the Jacobin Club. It bodes no good, surely, these five hundred turbulent characters, added to the anarchists of Paris. There has been a scheme concocted by Santerre and the Jacobins to promote an insurrection. The Jacobins have demanded the suspension of the king. The Assembly has not yet so decreed. Force must be brought to bear upon them. These Marseillais are part of the force. Santerre, with his mobs of the faubourgs, are to meet the arriving Marseillais, repair with them to the Place du Carrousel, encamp there, without tumult, they say, and await the suspension of the king. This scheme is partly carried out, but with some quite unlooked-for variations. But variations may well be expected when anarchists congregate. Santerre, for some reason, does not gather his expected recruits in the faubourgs, and is forced to meet the Marseillais with only a few men. Of course, Santerre must not fail in"], [410, "350 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. hospitality ; and so he offers to serve his guests with a repast in the Champs Elysees. Now it happens that at that same hour, a party of the National Guards of the battalion of the Filles St. Thomas, and other military men, devoted to the court, are also dining near this very spot. Two such diverse companies can hardly dine in peace in such close proximity. Behold the re sult ! The populace insult the Royalists. The insulted Royalists fly to arms. The populace invoke the aid of the patriotic Marseillais, who straightway rush with ardor to the spot, even though smoking dinner awaits their partaking of it. Some Royalists are wounded, one is killed ; and royal fugitives arrive breathless at the Tuil eries, with blood-stained faces and bespattered clothes ; and the awful crime is straightway laid up against the court ladies, that these, their friends and protectors, wounded and bleeding, are kindly received, and their wounds dressed, and that even royal fingers deign to ren der aid. Oh, terrible crime ! what fury it awakens in an archists' breasts ! Many Federalists who have come to Paris for the Federation Festival, on the 14th, have not yet departed, their delay boding much ; and now they parade the streets, tearing off cockades of ribbon here and there, trying to raise quarrels by declaring that all patriotic cockades should be made only of wool. Wool or ribbon ! behold the momentous import of the thing ! What that momentous import was exactly, the historians fail to state plainly. The reader may solve the riddle. Once again had La Fayette tried to save the king, urging him to place himself under the protection of his army, part of whom La Fayette felt confident he could still control in favor of a constitutional king. But blinded Louis refused, and sent the ungracious answer to the chivalrous general, \"that the best advice which"], [411, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 351 can be given to M. La Fayette is to continue to serve as a bugbear to the factions, by the able performance of his duty as a general.\" News reached the Jacobins that La Fayette had been scheming to aid in the escape of the king, and their wrath was hotly kindled against him. Numerous de mands were sent to the Assembly, urging that La Fayette should be tried as a traitor. On the 8th of August, 1792, the question concerning La Fayette was discussed, and it was decided by a large majority that there was not sufficient ground for an accusation. This result enraged the Jacobins still more, and they demanded the dethrone ment of the king. Petion (who was having a little more of mobs than he relished), together with the Girondins, preferred that the dethronement should be declared by the Assembly, rather than enforced by an insurrection and combat at the palace. Petion thereupon repaired to the Jacobin committee, and begged Chabot to put an end to the uprising insurrection, assuring him that the dethronement would in due time be demanded by the Assembly. But Chabot replied \" that nothing was to be hoped from an Assembly that had absolved the scoundrel La Fayette, and that the people were at length deter mined to take the matter into their own hands.\" Thiers says : \" People's minds were in fact too highly excited for the fears of Potion to be understood, and for him to be able to exercise his influence. A general agitation pervaded Paris. The drum beat the call in all quarters. The battalions of the National Guard assem bled, and repaired to their posts, with very discordant dispositions. The sections were filled, not with the greater number, but with the most ardent of the citi zens. The insurrectional committee had formed at three points. Fournier and some others were in the Fau-"], [412, "352 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. bourg St. Marceau; Santerre and Westerman occupied the Faubourg St. Antoine ; lastly, Danton, Camille Des moulins, and Carra were at the Cordeliers, with the Marseilles battalion. Barbaroux, after stationing scouts at the Assembly and the palace, had provided couriers ready to start for the south. He had also provided him self with a dose of poison, such was the uncertainty of success, and awaited at the Cordeliers the result of the insurrection. It is not known where Robespierre was. Danton had concealed Marat in a cellar belonging to the section, and had then taken possession of the tribune of the Cordeliers. Every one hesitated, as on the eve of a great revolution ; but Danton, with a daring proportion ate to the importance of the event, raised his thundering voice. He enumerated what he called the crimes of the court. He expatiated on the hatred of the latter to the Constitution ; its deceitful language ; its hypocritical promises, always belied by its conduct ; and lastly, its evident machinations for bringing in foreigners. 'The people,' said he, 'can now have recourse but to them selves ; for the Constitution is insufficient, and the Assem bly has absolved La Fayette. You have, therefore, none left to save you but yourselves. Lose no time, then ; for, this very night, satellites concealed in the palace are to sally forth upon the people and to slaughter them, before they leave Paris to repair to Coblentz. Save yourselves, then ! To arms ! to arms ! ' \" Regarding the measures of protection provided at the palace, Thiers says : \" The means of resistance were feeble and had been almost annihilated, either by decrees of the Assembly, or by the false measures of the court itself. The Constitutional Guard, dissolved by a decree of the Assembly, had not been replaced by the king, who had chosen rather to continue its pay to it, than to form"], [413, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 353 a new one. The force of the palace was thus diminished by eighteen hundred men. The regiments whose dispo sition had appeared favorable to the king at the time of the last Federation had been removed from Paris by the accustomed expedient of decrees. \"The Swiss could not be removed, owing to their capitulations, but their artillery had been taken from them ; and the court, when it had for a moment decided upon flight to Normandy, had sent thither one of those faithful battalions, upon pretext of guarding supplies of corn that were expected. This battalion had not yet been recalled. Some Swiss only, in barracks at Cour bevoie, had been authorized by Potion to come back, and they amounted altogether to no more than eight or nine hundred men. The gendarmerie had recently been composed of the old soldiers of the French Guards, the authors of the 14th of July. Lastly, the National Guard had neither the same officers, nor the same organization, nor the same attachment, as on the 6th of October, 1789. The staff had been reconstituted. A great number of the citizens had become disgusted with the service, and those who had not deserted their post were intimidated by. the fury of the populace. Thus the National Guard was, like all the bodies of the state, composed of a new revolutionary generation. It was divided, with the whole of France, into Constitutionalists and Republicans. The entire battalion of the Filles St. Thomas, and part of that of the Petits Peres, were attached to the king. The others were either indifferent or hostile. The gunners, in particular, who composed the principal strength, were decided Republicans. The fatigues incident to the duty of the latter had deterred the wealthy citizens from undertaking it. Locksmiths and blacksmiths were thus left in possession of the guns ; and almost all of them, belonging to the populace, partook of its dispositions."], [414, "354 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" Thus the king had left him about eight or nine hun dred Swiss, and rather more than one battalion of the National Guard. It will be recollected that the com mand of the National Guard, after La Fayette's resigna tion, had been transferred to six commanders of legions in rotation. It had fallen on that day, to the Command ant Mandat, an old officer, displeasing to the court for his constitutional opinions, but possessing its entire con fidence, from his firmness, his intelligence, and his at tachment to his duties. Mandat, general-in-chief on that fatal night, had hastily made the only possible dis positions. \" The floor of the great gallery leading from the Louvre to the Tuileries had already been cut away for a certain space, to prevent the passage of the assailants. Mandat, in consequence, took no precautions for protecting that wing, but directed his attention to the side next to the courts and the garden. Notwithstanding the signal by drum, few of the National Guards had assembled. The battalions remained incomplete. The most zealous of them proceeded singly to the palace, where Mandat had formed them into regiments, and posted them conjointly with the Swiss, in the courts, the garden, and the apart ments. He had placed one piece of cannon in the court of the Swiss, three in the central court, and three in that of the princes. These guns were unfortunately consigned to gunners of the National Guard, so that the enemy was actually in the fortress. But the Swiss, full of zeal and loyalty, watched them narrowly, ready at the first move ment to make themselves masters of their guns, and to drive them out of the precincts of the palace. \"Mandat had, moreover, placed some advanced posts of gendarmerie at the colonnade of the Louvre and the H6tel de Ville ; but this gendarmerie, as we have already"], [415, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 355 shown, was composed of old French Guards. To these defenders of the palace must be added a great number of old servants, whose age or moderation had prevented them from emigrating, and who, in the moment of dan ger, had come forward, some to absolve themselves for not having gone to Coblentz, others to die generously by the side of their prince. They had hastily provided themselves with all the weapons that they could procure in the palace. They were armed with swords and pis tols fastened to their waists by pocket-handkerchiefs. Some had even taken tongs and shovels from the fire places. Thus there was no want of jokes at this awful moment ; when the court ought to have been serious at least for once. This concourse of useless persons, in stead of rendering it any service, merely obstructed the National Guard, which could not reckon upon it, and tended only to increase the confusion, which was already too great.\" Such was the state of defence at the palace at this critical moment. Mayor Petion was sent for by the king, and on his arrival at the Tuileries, with -two muni cipal officers, he was so forcefully urged to sign an order for repelling force by force, that he was obliged reluc tantly to put his signature to the document. Potion, having made previous arrangements with the new municipality, \u2014 consisting of Danton, Manuel, and like insurrectional members, who had displaced the for mer municipal officers, and had their headquarters in the H6tel de Ville, \u2014 retired to his own house, where, by arrangement, an insurrectional force was to be stationed ostensibly to detain him as a prisoner, and thus screen his responsibility regarding the coming events. But upon arriving at his home, Petion found no desired jailers, and"], [416, "356 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. was himself obliged to send to the H6tel de Ville for men to come and place him under arrest. At length a few hundred men were sent to play the part of these mock jailers. Thus did the wily Petion provide for any issue which might result from the impending attack. The new insurrectional municipality summoned Mandat to appear before them at the H6tel de Ville. This sum mons was handed to him at the palace. Mandat, being suspicious of their designs, hesitated to obey, but was advised by those around him to comply. Mandat took the precaution to place in the hands of his son, who was with him at the palace, the order given him by Petion, authorizing the repelling of force by force, and about four o'clock in the morning he appeared at the Hdtel de Ville. Mandat was surprised to behold the new munici pality, and demands were immediately made by these municipal officers as to the orders he had issued. He was then ostensibly dismissed, but the president made a sign to those about him which was equivalent to a sen tence of death. As Mandat retired, he was seized by a band of murderers and instantly shot, and his body was stripped, with the hope of securing the order somewhere in his garments ; but not finding it, as it was already in the hands of his son at the palace, the assassins threw the body of Mandat into the river. Thus was the plan of defence of the palace prevented from being executed, and the death of the commandant left no leader at the Tuileries to superintend a success ful resistance. Louis had spent the night in listen ing to the various plans proposed by those around him, and had not retired, only throwing himself for a brief space of time upon his bed ; and at five o'clock in the morning, as he came from his apartments into the council room, where his family and friends were assembled, he"], [417, "FROM THE SAI.ONS TO THE CELLS. 357 presented a sorry spectacle, which the awful danger of the moment only prevented from being truly ludicrous. His crumpled clothes, and fat face distorted by emotion ; his hair curled and powdered on one side, bereft of either curl or powder on the other, which had pressed the pillow ; his corpulent body, and unsoldierly figure, and unkingly gait, made him a most pitiable sight. Marie Antoinette, alert, courageous, and proud, looked for a moment at her \" Pauvre Homme,\" as she had once called him, with min gled contempt and pity. Oh, for a man! a dauntless knight! an imperial king! Seizing a pistol from the belt of a grenadier standing near, the queen, with flash ing eyes and intrepid spirit, handed it to her husband, saying, \"Sire, it is time to show yourself.\" But the bewildered Louis, with eyes red and swollen by his night's vigils and devotional exercises with his confes sor, handed the pistol back to its owner, and sank into a chair in helpless inertia. To his praise, Madame Campan relates that at this cer tain hour of positive danger he refused to protect himself with quilted armor, as before, saying \"that on a day on which my party may have to fight against the revo lutionists, there seems to be something cowardly in pre serving my life by such means.\" As the early morning advances, and the approach of the threatening populace grows more certain, it is thought advisable that Louis should descend into the garden and review his troops, that his defenders may be excited to greater valor. His soldiers assembled there raise a faint applause; the old cry, \" Vive le Roi /\" is even heard. Dis couraged hearts beat quicker ; perhaps all is not yet lost. Louis passes on to the garden. Here appearances are not so hopeful; muttered words are growled forth, ac companied with ominous frowns. \" Down with the veto ! \""], [418, "358 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. But still Louis is not intimidated, and proceeds, accom panied for a short distance by the queen. Never had Marie Antoinette appeared more imperial than at this terrible hour. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes flashing with defiant fire, her lips compressed by firm resolution, her sensitive nostrils were dilated like a hunted deer at bay, her stately head was borne aloft with an imperious hauteur which marked her a true daughter of the C\u00e6sars. She gazed with unflinching glance and majestic courage on friend and foe. By her proud bearing and commanding dignity, she strove, with every nerve quivering with constrained tension, to coun terbalance the unkingly appearance of stolid Louis, who could inspire naught but contempt, rather than the necessary enthusiasm which was vital for their lives and for his throne. But the heroism of the queen was unavailing. As the king passed onwards into the garden, poor Marie Antoi nette re-entered the palace, saying to Madame Campan, \" All is lost. The king has shown no energy. A review like this has done us more harm than good ! \" Well mayst thou be disheartened, unfortunate queen ! And now from the garden, hoarser shouts are heard : \" Down ivith the veto ! Down with the tyrant ! \" \" Great God ! they are hooting the king. We are all lost ! \" exclaimed the heart-broken Marie Antoinette. The king returned to the palace from this ill-starred mockery of a review. The ominous clang of steel comes nearer. From every steeple rings the rallying alarm-bell. A living deluge of human beings streams through the streets. The vast mass surges, swells, and overflows, and spreads through every avenue leading to the palace. Above the beat of drums, and clang of bells, and boom of cannon, the wild"], [419, "359 FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. yells of frenzied furies are borne upon the air, and carried to the listening ear, like demoniacal curses from Hades. Nearer and nearer rushes, impetuous, this tumult uous mass of maniacal humanity. It were surely time that something be at least attempted. The stanch Swiss stand there with knit brows and eyes immovable, riveted upon the advancing foe. But what are nine hundred to oncoming thousands ? Behold, the gendarmes stationed by Mandat, at the colonnade of the Louvre, and other places, have already dispersed, and joined the populace. The National Guard placed in the royal apartments display dissatisfaction at the presence of the courtiers. \" Grenadiers ! \" cries the queen, with that old royal way of hers, \"these gentlemen are your comrades. They are come to die by your side.\" But the faces of the grenadiers remain suspicious, and another obstacle is added to the piled-up difficulties which con front the royal family. But now the rabble pour through the Place du Car rousel and gardens, into the various courts, and clamor ously demand entrance at the very palace gates. It is high time to hide or flee. As hiding seems impracticable in the face of such an excited mob, M. Roederer, Procureur Syndic, hastily enters the palace, and speeds to the council-room, where the king and queen, with their friends, are assem bled, and with impetuosity exclaims, \"Sire, you have not a moment to lose. Neither the number nor the dis position of the men here assembled can guarantee your life, or the lives of your family. There is no safety for you but in the midst of the Assembly.\" \" Go to the Assembly ! \" exclaims Marie Antoinette. \"Never! never will I take refuge there. Rather than submit to such infamy I would prefer to be nailed to the walls of the palace.\""], [420, "360 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. M. Roederer replies : \" It is there only that the royal family can be in safety. And it is necessary to escape immediately. In another quarter of an hour, perhaps, we shall not be able to command a retreat.\" \" What ! \" cries poor Marie Antoinette, in amazement and horror ; \" have we no defenders ? Are we alone ? \" \"Yes, Madame,\" answers Roederer; \"we are alone. The troops in the garden and in the court are fraterniz ing with your assailants and turning their guns against the palace. All Paris is on the march. Action is use less. Resistance is impossible.\" Once again the imperial spirit fires the eyes of Marie Antoinette, as with royal mien and commanding voice she turns to him and says : \" Silence, sir, silence ! It becomes you to be silent here. When the mischief is done, those who did it should not pretend to wish to remedy it.\" \"Madame,\" urged M. Roederer, \"you endanger the lives of your husband and children. Think of the re sponsibility which you take upon yourself.\" And Marie Antoinette was as true a wife and mother as she was every inch a queen, and she now bent her stately head, in obedience to her husband's voice, as rising, he said, \"Marchons!\" (Let us go). It was then eight o'clock in the morning. As the royal family passed out of the palace escorted by a guard of soldiers, the queen said to M. Roederer, \"You, sir, are answerable for the life of the king and for that of my son.\" \" Madame,\" replied Roederer, \" we undertake to die by your side ; but that is all we can promise.\" \" They march, \u2014 King Louis, Queen, Sister Elizabeth, the two royal children and governess, \u2014 these, with Syndic Roederer, and Officials of the Department, amid a"], [421, "FROM THE SALONS TO THE CELLS. 361 double rank of National Guards. The men with blunder busses, the steady red Swiss, gaze mournfully, reproach fully ; but hear only these words from Syndic Roederer : ' The King is going to the Assembly ; make way.' It has struck eight on all clocks some minutes ago; the King has left the Tuileries \u2014 forever.\" Bravely do the Swiss stand and meet the onrush of the mob-tide. Steel clashes on steel, bullets buzz through the corridors of the palace, cannons boom in the courts, pikes and clubs and weapons of all sorts are busy in the gardens. \" Behold, the fire slackens not, nor does the Swiss rolling-fire slacken from within. Nay, they clutched cannon, alas, cannon without linstock ; nor will the steel-and-flint answer, though they try it. Had it chanced to answer ! Patriot onlookers have their misgiv ings ; one strangest Patriot onlooker thinks that the Swiss, had they a commander, would beat. He is a man not unqualified to judge ; the name of him Napoleon Bonaparte. \" In remote streets men are drinking breakfast-coffee, following their affairs, with a start now and then as some dull echo reverberates a note louder. And here ? Marseillais fall wounded, but Barbaroux has surgeons; Barbaroux is close by, managing, though underhand and under cover. Marseillais fall death-struck, bequeath their firelock, specify in which pocket are the cartridges, and die murmuring, ' Revenge me, revenge thy country ! ' Brest Federe officers galloping in red coats are shot as Swiss. Lo you, the Carrousel has burst into flame ! Paris Pandemonium ! Nay, the poor city is in fever-fit and convulsion ; such crisis has lasted for the space of some half-hour. \"But what is this that, with legislative insignia, ven tures through the hubbub and death-hail, from the back"], [422, "362 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. entrance of the Manege, towards the Tuileries and Swiss ? Written order from his Majesty to cease firing ! 0 ye hapless Swiss, why was there no order not to begin it ? Gladly would the Swiss cease firing ; but who will bid mad insurrection cease firing ? To Insurrection you cannot speak; neither can it, hydra-headed, hear. The dead and dying, by the hundred, lie all around, are borne bleeding through the streets towards help, the sight of them, like a torch of the Furies, kindling madness. Patriot Paris roars : ' On, ye Patriots ; vengeance ! Vic tory or death ! ' There are men seen who rush on, armed only with walking-sticks. Terror and fury rule the hour. The Swiss, pressed on from without, paralyzed from within, have ceased to shoot, but not to be shot. What shall they do ? Desperate is the moment. Shelter or instant death ; yet, how ? where ? \" Surely few things in the history of carnage are pain fuller. What ineffaceable red streak, flickering so sad in the memory, is that, of this poor column of red Swiss dispersing into blackness and death ! Honor to you, brave men ; honorable pity, through long times ! Not martyrs were ye, and yet almost more.

Thus is the Tenth of August won and lost. Above a hundred carts heaped with dead fare towards the Cemetery of Sainte-Madeleine, bewailed, bewept, for all had kindred, all had mothers ; if not here, then there. It is one of those Carnage-fields, such as you read of by the name ' Glorious Victory,' brought home in this case to one's own door.\" x But let us follow Louis into the Assembly, where the royal family had taken refuge. As the king entered the Assembly-hall with his family, and followed by two min isters, he said to M. Vergniaud, who presided, \"I am come to prevent a great crime, and I think, gentlemen, that I cannot be safer than in your midst.\" The presi dent assured Louis that the members had sworn to die in defence of the constituted authorities. The king first took a seat by the side of the president of the Assembly ; but upon the observation of Chabot, that his presence might affect the freedom of the deliberations, the royal family were given a retreat in the reporter's box, the iron railing encircling which was torn down so that, in case of danger, the king and queen might hastily find refuge in the Assembly. In this small enclosure, during that sweltering August day, from eight in the morning till one o'clock at night, the royal family were crowded to gether, with scarcely room to move and little fresh air to breathe. To add to their humiliation, they were forced to be witnesses to the destruction of the throne. \" The royal victims were obliged to listen to the decrees which tore the crown from the brow of the king, and which placed his sceptre in the hands of his most envenomed foes.\" Not until long after midnight were they conducted to the four miserable cells allotted to them in the upper 1 Carlyle."], [426, "364 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. story of the old monastery of the Feuillans, in the lower apartments of which the Assembly held its sittings. In these cells, bare of furniture, gloomy as dungeons, with stone walls and brick floors, the king and his family found safety for the night. After thirty-six hours of sleeplessness and terror, such was the only place provided for the repose of the tortured sufferers. From the salons of Versailles to the cells of the Feuillans, what a pitiful fall ! But even these comfortless apartments shall still be looked back to with almost longing, when the terrible walls of the Conciergerie shall have closed upon the king, queen, and Madame Elizabeth. And what are the people doing on this dreadful night? Burying their dead and making funeral piles of the heaped-up bodies of the faithful Swiss, who have none to bury them with sacred rites and shed tears upon their graves. Their bodies, stripped and plun dered, are heartlessly thrown into vast piles, and the demolished furniture from the Tuileries, the tattered relics of royalty, are jeeringly added for fuel, and, in flammables being sprinkled over all, the torch is applied, and the Place du Carrousel blazes with these ghastly illuminations. \" Such had been that celebrated day, and the results which it had produced. The king and his family were prisoners at the Feuillans ; the three dis missed ministers were reinstated in their functions ; Danton, buried the preceding day in an obscure club, was Minister of Justice; Petion was. guarded in his own residence ; but to his name, shouted with enthusiasm, was added the appellation of Father of the People. Marat had issued from the dark retreat where Danton had concealed him during the attack, and now, armed with a sword, paraded through Paris at the head of the Marseilles bat talion.

As Madame Tourzel led to the queen the two royal children, Marie Antoinette gazed at them fondly through her tear-dimmed eyes, and murmured, \" Poor children ! how heart-rending it is, instead of handing down to them so fine an inheritance, to say it ends with us.\" \" I still see, in imagination,\" writes Madame Campan, \" and shall always see, that narrow cell of the Feuillans, hung with green paper ; that wretched couch, where the dethroned queen stretched out her arms to us, saying that our misfortunes, of which she was the cause, aggravated her own. There, for the last time, I saw the tears, I heard the sobs of her, whom high birth, the endowments of nature, and, above all, goodness of heart, had seemed to destine for the ornament of a throne and for the happiness of her people.\" At ten o'clock in the morning the royal family were again conducted to the reporter's gallery in the Assembly hall. Several of the Swiss, who had been taken prisoners on the preceding day, had been brought by humane peo ple to the Assembly, in order to save their lives. The mob now clamored loudly at the door of the hall, de manding the lives of the Swiss and of the escort of the king. President Vergniaud was so shocked by their brutal ferocity that he exclaimed, \" Great God ! what cannibals ! \" The king, convinced that his hour of death had come, urged upon his friends to fly and leave him to"], [430, "366 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. his fate, but they all heroically persisted in sharing his dangers. At length the Assembly, with great difficulty, succeeded in removing the Swiss to the prison of the Abbaye, promising the mob that they should be speedily tried and punished. At the close of this day the king and queen were again conducted to their cells, and now their friends were no longer permitted to accompany them. \"I am, then, a prisoner, gentlemen,\" said Louis, bit terly ; \" Charles I. was more fortunate than myself. His friends were permitted to accompany him to the scaf fold.\" For the third day the suffering royal family were forced to pass the weary hours in the Assembly hall. Thiers says : \"The Assembly had voted the suspension, and the clubs were for dethronement. In appointing a governor for the dauphin, the former had presupposed the continu ance of royalty, and the latter were for a republic. The majority of the Assembly thought that it behooved it to make an active defence against foreigners, but to spare the vanquished. The clubs, on the contrary, maintained that it was right not only to defend themselves against foreign foes, but to deal severely with those who, in trenched in the palace, had intended to massacre the peo ple, and to bring the Prussians to Paris.\" The Assembly had surrendered the safe-keeping of the king to the Commune of Paris. \" It was an hour after midnight when the royal family were led from the apart ments of the Temple to which they had first been con ducted, to their prison in the Tower. The night was intensely dark. Dragoons with drawn sabres marched by the side of the king, while municipal officers with lanterns guided their steps.

As in perfect silence the sad proces sion was passing through the garden, a valet-de-chambre of the king inquired in a low tone of voice, whither the king was to be conducted. \" ' Thy master,' was the reply, ' has been used to gilded roofs. Now he will see how the assassins of the people are lodged.' \" And how they were lodged in this dreadful Tower we will let the daughter of that king relate.

Madame Royale was afterwards the Duchesse D'Angou leme.) \" On the 13th of August, 1792, at seven o'clock in the evening, the king, my father, arrived at the Temple, accompanied by his family. The gunner wanted to con duct him to the Tower alone, and to leave us at the castle ; but Manuel had received an order during our passage to the prison, to confine us all in the Tower. Petion succeeded in appeasing the rage of the gunners, and we all entered the castle together, accompanied by the municipal officers, who kept my father constantly in sight. Manuel alone remained with us. My brother, being quite overcome from want of sleep, was conducted by Madame de Tourzel, at eleven o'clock, to the Tower, which was now decidedly fixed upon as our destination. My father accompanied us there at one o'clock in the morning; but no preparation whatever had been made for our reception. My aunt was obliged to sleep in the kitchen, and it is said that Manuel himself appeared ashamed on conducting her into it."], [434, "370 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" The following are the names of the persons who shared our sad confinement in this miserable place: Madame the Princess Lamballe ; Madame de Tourzel and Pauline, her daughter; Messieurs Hue and Chamilly, who were attached to the personal service of my father \u2014 Madame de Navarre, femme-de-chambre of my aunt ; Madame St. Brice, femme-de-chambre attached to the household of my brother \u2014 Madame Thibaut, in the ser vice of my mother, and Madame Bazire in mine. \u2014 My father had three men with him, \u2014 Turgy, Chretien, and Marchant. \"The next morning, the 14th, my brother breakfasted with my mother ; we then went to look at the great halls of the Tower, which, they told us, were to be fitted up for our reception, the turret where we then were, being too small to contain so many of us.

My father was so fortunate as to find a library, which gave him occupation ; my mother employed her time in working embroidery. The municipal officers conducted themselves with the greatest familiarity, and showed no respect whatever for the king. One of them always remained near him, and kept him constantly in sight. My father requested to be allowed a man and a woman to do the coarse work of our menage. \"On the night of the 19th of August, a decree of the Commune was brought to the Temple, ordering the removal of every person who was not of the royal family. M. Hue and M. Chamilly were taken out of the apartment of my father, who was left alone with a muni-"], [435, "THE ROYAL FAMILY TAKEN TO THE TEMPLE."], [436, ""], [437, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 371 cipal officer. They then proceeded to the room occupied by my mother, for the purpose of removing the Princess Lamballe. My mother strongly opposed the measure, saying what was exactly true, that the princess belonged to the royal family ; the officers, however, refused to listen to her representations. My aunt came down with Madame de Navarre and Pauline de Tourzel. The muni cipal officers assured us that these ladies would be allowed to return, after having been interrogated at the Commune. My brother was taken into the apartment of my mother, in order to avoid leaving him alone. It was with difficulty that my mother could tear herself from the arms of the Princess Lamballe. We embraced all these ladies, not, however, without the hope of seeing them again the next day. Neither of the four of us who remained behind closed our eyes during the entire night. \" My father, though unable to sleep, remained in his own room, where the municipal officers also passed the night. The next morning, at seven o'clock, we were told that the ladies who had been taken from us the preced ing day were not to return to the Temple, and that they had been sent to the prison of La Force. We were not a little surprised at nine o'clock at seeing M. Hue enter the room. He informed my father that he had been examined before the Council-general of the Commune, who, having found him innocent, had given him leave to return to the Temple. \" After dinner, Petion sent a man and a woman named Tison, to do the coarse work. My mother took my brother into her room, and sent me into another room with my aunt. We were separated from my mother by a small chamber, occupied by a municipal officer and a sentinel. My father was above stairs, and, learning that an apartment was preparing for his reception, he was by"], [438, "372 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. no means pleased with the intended arrangement, as it would have the effect of removing him to a greater dis tance from us. He accordingly sent for Palloy, the inspector of the workmen, with the intention of having the preparations relinquished ; but Palloy, in the most insolent tone and manner, replied, that he received his orders only from the Commune. \" It was our custom to go up to my father's room every day to breakfast, and we then accompanied him down stairs to the apartment occupied by my mother, where he spent the entire day. We walked every day in the garden, on account of my brother's health, and, while taking the air, my father was always certain to be in sulted by the guard. On the anniversary of St. Louis, so early as seven o'clock in the morning, the air of Ca Ira was sung in a loud voice under the windows of the Temple. \" We were informed next morning by one of the muni cipal officers, that M. de La Fayette had left France ; and Manuel, who came to the Temple in the evening, confirmed this intelligence to my father. He brought my aunt Elizabeth a letter from my aunts at Rome : this was the last letter any of us received from abroad. My father was now no longer addressed by the title of King ; nor was the slightest demonstration of respect shown him ; he was never addressed as Sire, or Your Majesty, but simply Monsieur or Louis. The municipal officers remained constantly seated in his chamber, and never thought it necessary to take off their hats in his pres ence. They took his sword from him, and searched his pockets. Potion sent Cl\u00a3ry, who had been attached to the personal service of my father, to wait upon him, and also sent as turnkey the horrible man who forced in the door of my father's apartment on the 20th of June, 1792,"], [439, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 373 and who was on the point of murdering him. This man never left the Tower for a moment, and put everything he possibly could invent into practice for the purpose of tormenting my father. He sometimes amused him self with singing, in our presence, the song of the La Carmagnole, and several other songs of the same descrip tion ; and, at another time, knowing that my mother had a great objection to the smell of tobacco, he blew a puff of smoke into her's and my father's faces, as he passed near them. There was no sort of insult or disgusting treatment that he did not invent for our annoyance. My father endured it all with mildness, and pardoned the unworthy man from the bottom of his heart. As for my mother, she supported his repeated insults with a calm dignity which frequently awed him into respect. \" The garden was full of laborers, who constantly in sulted my father ; and one of them went so far as to exclaim in his presence, that he wished he could have an opportunity of striking off the queen's head with the spade he held in his hand. These insults redoubled on the 2d of September, which we were at a loss to account for. Stones were thrown from the neighboring windows at my father, but they fortunately did not reach him. A woman, whose inclinations were apparently friendly, wrote on a large pasteboard the words, ' Verdun is taken,' which she raised on a pole to the window of our apart ment. My aunt had time to read it, and it escaped the notice of the municipal officers. We had scarcely heard this news when a new municipal officer, of the name of Mathieu, arrived at the Temple ; his countenance was inflamed with rage, and he ordered my father, in a rough voice, to retire into his apartment. We followed him, being apprehensive that it was their intention to separate us. On our arrival up stairs, Mathieu met M. Hue, whom"], [440, "374 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. he seized by the collar, saying that he arrested him. M. Hue, with a view to gain time to take the orders of my parents, asked leave to make a parcel of his things ; Mathieu refused to allow him; but another municipal officer, who was more charitably inclined, permitted him to do so. Mathieu then turned towards my father, addressing him in the most insulting manner, and say ing all that the meanest and most unworthy feelings could dictate ; among others : ' The ginirale has beaten \u2014 the tocsin has been rung \u2014 the alarm-guns have been fired \u2014 the emigrants are at Verdun; if they come, we shall all be lost ; but you shall be the first to perish.' \" My father listened to these insults, and a thousand others of the same nature, with the dignified calm in spired by hope. My brother burst into tears, and fled into an adjoining room, whither I hastened after him, and had the utmost difficulty to console him, and to calm his fears respecting my father, whom he thought already on the brink of destruction. M. Hue had in the mean time returned, and, after Mathieu had once more repeated his insulting conduct to my father, they both left the Temple together. M. Hue was taken to La Mairie. The massacres had already commenced at the Abbaye. After remaining a month in prison, M. Hue was released, but returned no more to the Temple. \"The municipal officers all joined in their condemna tion of the violent conduct of Mathieu, at the same time that their own bearing towards my father was scarcely any better. They told him that it was a certain fact that the king of Prussia was on his march through France, and that he was putting to death all the French men he met, by virtue of a warrant with the signature of Louis. There was no sort of calumny, however ridiculous or incredible, that they did not invent as an"], [441, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 375 excuse for their insulting language. My mother being unable to close her eyes, heard the genirale beat during the entire night, for what reason we could not imagine. \" At eight o'clock on the morning of the 3d of Sep tember, Manuel came to see my father, and assured him that Madame de Lamballe, and all the other persons who had been taken from the Temple, were in good health, and that they were all confined together, under very easy and quiet circumstances, in the prison of La Force. At three o'clock we were suddenly alarmed by the most frightful cries ; the king had only just risen from table, and was playing at trictrac with my mother, which gave them an opportunity of speaking to each other without being heard. The municipal officer who was on guard in the room behaved very well ; he closed the door and the window, and drew the curtains, to prevent our seeing what was going on outside. The men who were at work in the Temple, and Rocher the turnkey, joined the mob, whose clamorous menaces were redoubled at this addi tion to their numbers. Several officers of the guard and municipal officers entered my father's apartment ; the former wanted my father to show himself at the window. The municipal officers opposed this cruel violence, and, on my father's inquiring the cause of the cries and tumult, a young officer of the guard said to him : ' Since you must know it, then, it is the head of Madame de Lamballe that they want to show you.' \" At these words, my mother was struck with horror : it was the only time I saw her firmness forsake her for a moment. The municipals remonstrated with the offi cer ; but my father, with his usual benevolence of heart, endeavored to excuse him, by saying that it was not the fault of the officer, but his only, for having asked him the question. The tumult lasted until five o'clock. We"], [442, "376 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. learned that the mob had wished to force in the doors, and that the municipals had prevented them by placing a tri-colored scarf across the entrance, but that they were at length prevailed upon to allow six of the murderers to make the round of our prison, with the head of Madame de Lamballe paraded on a pike, but on condi tion that they should leave the remainder of their band without the gates. On this deputation entering the court, Rocher broke out into a vociferous shout of joy on seeing the head of Madame de Lamballe, and scolded a young man who was taken ill through horror at the sight of so dreadful a spectacle. The tumult was scarcely subsided, when Potion, instead of endeavoring to stop the massacre, with perfect coldness sent his secretary to my father, to settla some accounts of money. \" The municipal officer who had sacrificed his scarf for our preservation, made my father pay him the cost of it. My aunt and I heard the generate beating the whole of the night. My unhappy mother did not even try to sleep; her sobs and sighs of grief reached the room where we lay. On one occasion, the guard were called to arms ; it was said that the enemy had made their appearance ; the dreadful Rocher, on hearing this report, took up a large sabre, and cried out to my father, in a tone of insulting determination, ' If they come, I kill you ! ' \" Whenever I took lessons from my mother, and gave her my exercises for correction, a municipal officer always continued looking over my shoulder, lest what I was writing should be connected with some conspiracy. The newspapers were taken from us to prevent our knowing what was going on outside. One day they brought a paper to my father, saying that it contained some very interesting news. Horrid to relate, the passage they"], [443, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 377 alluded to was one where it was said that they would make a cannon-ball of the head of Louis ! The calm and contemptuous silence of my father completely de feated the cruel designs of those who showed him this diabolical paper. A few evenings after, a municipal offi cer, who was appointed to our guard, addressed us, on entering our apartment, in the most threatening language, and repeated what had been already frequently said to us, that we should every one of us be instantly put to death if the enemy approached the capital. He added, that the fate of my brother alone excited his compassion, but that he was doomed to die, as he was the son of a tyrant. Such were the scenes to which we were daily exposed. \" The Republic was established on the 22d of Septem ber. The announcement of this event was made to us with all the demonstrations of joy, and we were at the same time informed of the departure of the foreign enemy. We were unwilling to believe the truth of this intelli gence, but the fact was certain. At the beginning of October we were deprived of the use of pens, ink, paper, and pencils, which were searched for in every possible place, and even with unnecessary rigor. Notwithstand ing the closeness of their search, my mother and I suc ceeded in concealing our pencils, of which we kept possession ; my father and my aunt gave up theirs. On the evening of the same day, as my father had finished his supper, and was about to retire, he was told to wait, \u2014 that he was going to be placed in another apartment, and that he would be separated from us. The natural courage and firmness of my mother entirely forsook her on hearing this dreadful intelligence. We parted with my father, drowned in tears, but not, how ever, without the hope of seeing him again. The next"], [444, "378 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. day our breakfast was laid for us in a separate room from his : my mother refused to take anything. \"The municipal officers, affected and alarmed at her utter desolation, granted us permission to see my father ; but only at the hours of meals, and under the express conditions that we should not converse in a low voice or in a foreign language, but that we should speak so as to be heard, and in good French. We went down stairs to dine in my father's room, and with our hearts full of joy at the idea of seeing him. One of the municipal officers having observed my aunt whisper something to my father, called her to a severe account. \"In the evening, at supper-time, either my mother or my aunt went to put my brother to bed, and the other accompanied me to supper with my father. In the morning, after breakfast, we remained in his room a sufficient time to allow C16ry to comb our hair, as he was no longer permitted to enter my mother's apartment, and as it also gave us an excuse for remaining a few moments longer with my father. We all walked to gether in the garden at twelve. \" Manuel came to see my father, and, in the most dis respectful manner, stripped him of the Cordon Rouge which he happened to wear that day. He assured my father that Madame de Lamballe alone had perished of all those who had been taken from the Temple. Cl\u00a3ry, Tison, and his wife were obliged to take an oath of fidel ity to the nation. A municipal officer, on arriving one evening at the Temple, awoke my brother from his sleep, in the roughest manner, under pretence of assuring him self of his identity : this was the only time I observed my mother lose her patience for a moment. Another of these officers told my mother that the project of Petion was not to have my father put to death, but to have him"], [445, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 379 confined for life in the castle of Chambord, with my brother. My father had been removed into an apart ment under that of my mother, and my brother lay in his room ; Clery slept in the same room with a municipal officer : all the windows were secured with iron bars, and were constructed so as only to admit the light from above. \"We usually spent our time in the following manner: My father always rose at seven o'clock and prayed until eight ; he then dressed himself and my brother, which occupied him until nine, when he came to breakfast in my mother's apartment. After breakfast, my father heard my brother's lessons until eleven o'clock ; my brother then played until twelve, at which hour we all went together to walk in the garden, no matter what the weather was, because it was necessary that the guard, which was relieved at that hour, should identify each of us, and be able to answer for our presence. We generally remained walking until two o'clock, when we went to dinner. After dinner, my father and mother played at trictrac or at piquet ; or rather, they pretended to play, in order to have an opportunity of saying a few words to each other. At four o'clock my mother returned up stairs with us, and took my brother with her, my father being in the habit of sleeping at that hour. At six o'clock my brother returned to my father, who again taught him his lessons, and allowed him to play until supper. At nine o'clock my mother undressed him and put him to bed, after which we all went up to my mother's apartment, where we remained together until eleven, at which hour my father retired to rest. \"My mother was constantly employed in working embroidery ; she also directed my studies, and frequently made me read to her aloud. My aunt spent the greater"], [446, "380 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. part of her time in praying, and always read the prayers of the day : she read a great number of books of piety, which my mother frequently requested her to read aloud. \" The newspapers were restored to us, in order that we might see the account of the foreign enemy's departure, and the horrid reports that were disseminated respect ing the king. One day a municipal officer said to us, ' Ladies, I have some good news to tell you : a great number of emigrant traitors have been taken ; if you are patriots, you must be glad to hear it.' My mother, as was her custom on such occasions, did not say a single word, and even pretended not to hear what was said : it often happened that they felt overawed by her calm and dignified contempt; it was rarely to her that they chose to address themselves. The Convention came this day, for the first time, to see the king. The members compos ing the deputation asked him if he had any complaints to make ; he replied that he had none, and that he was con tented as long as he was with his family. Clery com plained that the persons who furnished provisions at the Temple were not regularly paid. Chabot replied, ' Let them wait ; the nation is security for the money.' Some time after, as we were at dinner, a number of gendarmes entered the room, laid violent hold on Clery, and ordered him to go with them to the tribunal. He returned to the Temple at twelve o'clock at night, and afterwards continued to act with the utmost fidelity. \" One day we were alarmed by a great tumult in the street, arising from the mob who crowded round the Tem ple, demanding the death of my father and of my mother, and came under our very windows, that we might hear these cruel expressions. The Commune was changed on the 2d of December, and the new municipal officers came to the Temple at ten o'clock in the evening, for the pur-"], [447, "OCCUPATIONS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY As THE TEMPLE."], [448, ""], [449, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 381 pose of identifying my father and his family. A few days afterwards a decree was issued, ordering Tison and Clery to be removed from our apartments, and all knives, scissors, and sharp-edged instruments to be taken from us, and also directing that the dishes that were served to us should all be carefully tasted. In pursuance of the decree, a search was made throughout our apartments, and we were compelled to give up our scissors. \"On the 11th of December we were thrown into great alarm by the beating of the drum and the arrival of a body of troops at the Temple. My father went down to his own apartment immediately after breakfast, with my brother. At eleven o'clock he was visited by Chambon, the mayor ; Chaumette, the procureur-general, and Col ombeau, the registrar of the Commune. They announced to him the decree of the Convention, ordering him to be brought immediately to its bar, to undergo an examina tion. They prevailed upon him to send my brother to us ; but, not having the decree of the Convention with them, they kept him waiting for it nearly two hours. He left the Temple about one o'clock, in the mayor's carriage, accompanied by Chaumette and Columbeau, and escorted by a body of municipal officers on foot. My father, observing that Colombeau saluted several persons on their passage, asked him if they were all friends of his, to which Colombeau replied, 'They are all honest citizens of the 10th of August, whom I never see with out a warm feeling of joy and friendship.' \" I shall say nothing of the manner in which my father conducted himself at the Convention ; his behavior on that day is known to every one ; his firmness, his mild ness, his benevolence, and his courage in the midst of the murderers who thirsted after his blood, are traits of character which will never be forgotten, and which will be held in admiration to the remotest posterity."], [450, "382 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" The king returned to the tower of the Temple at six o'clock, accompanied by the same escort. We were in a state of uneasiness during his absence such as it would be impossible to describe. My mother tried every means in her power with the municipal officers by whom she was guarded, to learn from them what was passing. It was the first time she deigned to ask them a question. These men refused to give her any information, and we were kept in complete ignorance of what was going on until my father returned. Immediately on his arrival my mother prayed to be allowed to see him, and even condescended to demand the permission of Chambon ; but she received no answer to her message. My brother remained with her that night ; as there was no bed for him, she gave him up her own and remained sitting up the entire night, and appeared in such a state of mind that my aunt at first refused to leave her, but she forced us both to retire to rest. \" The next morning my mother again sent to demand leave to see my father and to obtain the newspapers, in order to learn the particulars of his trial ; she added, that if they would not grant her permission to see my father, they could not refuse it to his children. This demand was laid before the Council-general ; the news papers were refused, but permission was granted my brother and myself to see my father, on condition that we should henceforth be separated from my mother. This determination being imparted to my father, his answer was, that however great the pleasure would be to see his children, the important affairs he had to occupy him would not allow time to attend to his son, and that his daughter could, on no account, leave her mother. My brother's bed was accordingly removed into my mother's room."], [451, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 383 \" The Convention sent a deputation to visit my father. He demanded the assistance of counsel, and to be pro vided with ink and paper, and with razors to shave him self. His demands were acceded to, and M. Malesherbes, Trouchet, and Deseze, his three counsel, waited upon him ; but he was always obliged to go with them into the adjoining turret, in order to be able to speak to them without being overheard. His walks in the garden were restrained, and ours also. Thus we could neither see nor receive intelligence of each other except through the medium of the municipal officers. On the 26th of De cember, St. Stephen's Day, my father made his will, being apprehensive that he would be assassinated that day on his way to the Convention. Notwithstanding this well-grounded fear, he went there with his usual unruffled calmness, and left the care of his defence to M. Deseze. He set out from the Temple at eleven, and returned at three. From that day he was waited upon daily by his counsel. \" At length, on the 18th of January, the day on which the sentence was passed, the municipal authorities entered the king's apartment at eleven o'clock, and stated that they had received orders not to lose sight of him for a moment. He asked if his fate was decided ; they replied that it was not. The following morning, M. de Males herbes informed him that his sentence was pronounced ; \u2014 ' But, Sire,' added he, ' the wretches who condemned you are not yet masters, and all the good men of the nation will crowd around Your Majesty to save you, or perish at your feet.' ' M. de Malesherbes' said my father, ' that would compromise the safety of many, and would be the means of introducing civil war into Paris; I prefer death to such an alternative. I pray you to order them, in my name, to make no attempt whatsoever to save me;"], [452, "384 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the King of France never dies ! ' After this last confer ence he was not allowed to see his counsel ; he gave the municipal officers a note, in which he demanded their attendance and complained of the constraint imposed upon him by the constant presence of his guards. But no attention whatever was paid to this representation. \" On Sunday, the 20th of January, Garat, the minister of justice, and the other members of the executive power, came in a body, to notify my father of his sentence of death for the following day. He listened to this fatal announcement with courage and religious resignation. He demanded a reprieve of three days, to allow him time to know what would become of his family, and to have the assistance of a Catholic confessor ; the reprieve was refused. Garat assured my father that there was no charge whatever against his family, and that they would be sent out of France. He demanded permission to have the spiritual ministration of the Abb6 Edgeworth de Firmont, whose address he gave. Garat brought M. Edgeworth to him. The king dined as usual, which surprised the municipal officers, as their idea was that he would attempt to put an end to his existence. \"We received information of the sentence that had been passed on my father, on Sunday, the 20th, by the hawkers, who cried the decree of the Convention imme diately under our windows. At seven o'clock in the evening we were permitted to see him, by virtue of a decree of the Convention. We rushed down stairs to his apartment, and found him greatly changed. He wept through grief on our account, and not through fear of his approaching end. He related the particulars of his trial to my mother, and made excuses for the wretches who sentenced him to death. He repeated to her that it had been proposed to have recourse to the"], [453, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 385 Primary Assemblies, but that he had opposed the meas ure, through fear of throwing the state into disorder. He afterwards gave religious instructions to my brother, and exhorted him, above all things, to pardon those who caused his death, and he gave his blessing to him and to me. My mother was earnest in her entreaties to have us all allowed to pass the night with my father ; but he opposed our doing so with gentle firmness, and repre sented to my mother the importance of his being left in tranquillity. She then asked his permission to come at least and see him the next morning : this he granted her ; but the moment we had left him, he told the guards not to allow us again down stairs, as our presence caused him too much pain and agitation. He then remained for some time with his confessor, retired to rest at midnight, and slept until five o'clock, when he was awakened by the beating of the drum. At six o'clock the Abbe Edge worth said mass, at which my father received the sacra ment. About nine o'clock he set out from the Temple, and, on descending the staircase, he handed his will to one of the municipal officers, to whom he also confided a sum of money that M. de Malesherbes had brought him, which he requested the officer to return to that gentle man ; instead of which, the municipal officers divided it amongst themselves. Meeting, on his passage through the tower, a turnkey whom he had reprimanded rather sharply the day before, he said to him, ' Mathieu, I am sorry for having offended you.' He read the prayers of the dying on his way to the place of execution, and, on ascending the scaffold, he endeavored to address the people ; but Santerre prevented him, by ordering the drum to be beaten. The two or three words he had time to say were heard only by a few persons. He then un dressed himself without assistance, and his hands were"], [454, "386 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. tied with his own handkerchief. At the moment when his spirit left his body, the Abb6 exclaimed, ' Son of St. Louis, ascend to Heaven ! ' \" He received his death-stroke on the 21st of January, 1793, at ten minutes after ten o'clock in the morning. Thus died Louis the Sixteenth, King of France, at the age of thirty-nine years, five months, and three days, after a reign of eighteen years, and imprisonment of five months and eight clays. Such was the life of the king, my father, during his severe captivity. His conduct during that period was characterized alone by the exer cise of piety, greatness of mind, benevolence, mildness, courage, and patience in supporting the most unworthy treatment, and the most horrible calumnies ; clemency and charity in pardoning his murderers, from the bottom of his soul, and the love of God, of his family, and of his people, \u2014 a love which he gave proofs of to his last sigh, and of which he has gone to receive the reward in the bosom of the all-powerful and merciful God. \" On the morning of the dreadful day we rose at six o'clock. The evening before, my mother had scarcely sufficient strength to undress my brother and put him to bed. She threw herself on her bed without taking off her clothes, and we heard her, during the entire night, tremble with cold and agony. At a quarter after six our door was opened, and we were asked for a prayer book for my father to use at mass. We thought we were to go down to see my father, and continued to retain this hope until we learned, but too plainly, by the cries of joy of an unbridled populace, that the crime was consummated. In the evening my mother asked to see Clery, who remained near my father to his last moments, and who she thought it probable would have been charged by him with some message or commission for her. We"], [455, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 387 were desirous for the shock this interview would give her, as we hoped it might cause her grief to overflow, and rescue her from that state of smothered agony in which we now beheld her. As we supposed, my father had ordered Clery to return to my unhappy mother his wedding-ring, with the message from him, that he parted with it only with his life : he had also given him a packet containing some of my mother's hair and of ours, and told him that they were so dear to him, that he had kept them till that moment about his person. The municipal officers informed us that Clery was in a dread ful state, and was in despair at not being allowed to see us. My mother charged some of the municipal officers to present her demand to the Commune ; she also asked for mourning for herself and us. Cldry remained for one month more at the Temple, at the end of which time he was set at liberty. \" We were now allowed a little more liberty ; our guards were under the idea that we would soon be sent out of the country. But nothing could calm the anguish of my mother ; not the slightest gleam of hope found its way to her heart ; the thought of life or death had become entirely indifferent to her. She sometimes looked at us with an air of pity and compassion which made us shud der within ourselves. It was a happy circumstance that the grief in which I was sunk increased my illness, as it served to distract her attention. My physician, Brunier, and Lacaze, the surgeon, were sent for ; and by their care I was restored to health in a month. \" We were allowed to see persons who brought our mourning, but only in the presence of the municipal officers. My mother was unwilling to walk any more in the garden, as it was necessary to pass the door of my father's room in going there, which caused her the"], [456, "388 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. greatest pain; but as she was apprehensive that the want of air might injure the health of my brother and myself, she at length asked permission, about the end of February, to take the air on the top of the tower, which request was granted her. \"Dumouriez having left France, a great change took place in our situation. New precautions were taken for our security, and the vigilance of our keepers daily in creased. On the 28th of April, at half-past ten in the evening, my mother and I had just retired to rest, when Hehert arrived at the Temple, accompanied by several other municipal officers. We rose with precipitation. They read to us a decree of the Commune, by which they were ordered to search our apartment with the closest scrutiny, which they executed to the very letter of their directions, not even allowing the mattresses to escape their examination. My poor brother was asleep. They dragged him from his bed in the most unfeeling manner, in order to see if there was anything concealed in it : my mother took him in her arms, quite benumbed with cold. They took from my mother the address of a shopkeeper, which she had about her, a stick of sealing-wax, which they found in my aunt's room, and took from me a sacred heart of Jesus, and a paper inscribed with a prayer for France ; their visit lasted until four o'clock in the morn ing. They drew up a joroces-verbal, stating all they had found, and forced my mother and my aunt to sign it, by threatening to take away my brother and me, in case they should refuse. They were in a violent passion at having found nothing but mere trifles. My brother's health began to decline visibly, and he never afterwards recovered it. The want of air and of exercise was most injurious to him, at the same time that the poor child was exposed, at the age of eight years, to a sort of life"], [457, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 389 most destructive at his tender years, living as he was in the midst of alarm, and exposed to continual terror and irritation. Previous to my brother's illness, I always slept in my mother's chamber, in order to be near her, in case she or my brother should be taken sick during the night ; but during his illness my aunt slept in my place. \" On the 3d of July a decree of the Convention was read to us, ordering that my brother should be separated from us and lodged in the most secure apartment in the Tower. Scarcely had he heard this dreadful warrant, than he threw himself into my mother's arms, uttered the most piercing cries, and supplicated and entreated that they would not separate him from her. On her part, my poor mother was completely overcome by this cruel stroke. She persisted in her refusal to give up my brother, and defended, against the municipal officers, the bed on which she had laid him. The latter, being resolved to listen to no persuasions, threatened to use violence and to call up the guard. My mother answered that they might do as they wished, but they should kill her before they should tear her child from her. An entire hour passed in this manner; in tears, cries, suppli cations, on our part ; and refusals, threats, and menaces on that of the municipals. At length they grew enraged, threatened so positively to kill both him and me, that her love for us once more compelled her to yield. My aunt and I took my brother out of bed, as my mother herself had no strength left; and as soon as he was dressed, she took him in her arms, and after bathing him in her tears, which were the more bitter as she fore saw that it was the last time she should ever see him, she placed him herself in the hands of the municipal officers. The poor child embraced us all in the most"], [458, "390 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. affecting manner, and left the room with the municipal officers, with his eyes streaming with tears. My mother charged them with a message from her to the Council- General, by which she demanded permission to see her son, were it only at the hour of meals : this message they promised to deliver. She was already completely overcome by this cruel separation; but her desolation rose to the highest pitch when she learned that it was Simon, the shoemaker, whom she had before seen in his quality of municipal officer, that was charged with the care of her unhappy child. She repeated incessantly her supplications to be allowed to see him, but always met with a decided refusal ; and we understood my poor brother continued weeping for two entire days, and prayed, in the most heart-rending tones, to be permitted to see us. \"The municipal officers no longer remained in my mother's apartment : we were confined under locks and bolts, both day and night. It was a relief to us to be freed from the presence of these men. The guards now only came three times a day, when they brought us our meals, and inspected the rooms and the windows, to see that none of the bars were out of their places. We had no longer any one to wait upon us, and were by no means displeased at it, as I much preferred being left alone : my aunt and I made the beds, and waited upon my mother. We ascended to the top of the Tower very frequently, because my brother also walked there at his side of the building, and the only pleasure my mother now had, was to get an occasional distant glimpse of him through a small slit in the division-wall. She used to remain there for entire hours, watching the moment when she could see her child : this was her only desire, her only solace, and her only occupation."], [459, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 391 \" It was only very rarely that she was able to obtain any intelligence of him, either through the municipal officers, who sometimes had occasion to see Simon, or by Tison, who, desirous to make amends for his past con duct, sought every opportunity of getting information for us respecting my brother. As for Simon, his treat ment of my brother was more cruel than can be possibly imagined, and the unworthy man redoubled his severity towards the child because he wept at being separated from us ; in fact, he so completely affrighted the mind of my unhappy brother that he no longer even dared to shed a tear. My aunt requested Tison, and all those who, through a kind motive and through pity for the child, gave us these particulars, to conceal these horrible circumstances from the knowledge of my mother : she, however, heard them, or at least suspected them but too well. At one time a report was spread that my brother had been seen upon the Boulevard ; and the guard, dis satisfied at not being allowed to see him, repeated that he was no longer in the Temple. Alas ! we were deluded by a momentary hope ; we believed the report, but were soon undeceived, the Convention having given orders that he should be taken down to the garden, in order to be seen by the public. Upon this occasion my brother, whose natural character they had not yet had time to alter or destroy, complained at being separated from my mother, and asked to see the law by which he was con demned; they, however, forced him to be silent. The members of the Convention who came to the Temple for the purpose of verifying the presence of my brother, came up stairs to my mother's apartment : she made a complaint to them of the extreme cruelty that had been exercised in taking her son from her ; they replied that it was considered necessary to take that measure. The"], [460, "392 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. new procureur-general also came to see us ; his manner astonished us, notwithstanding the experience we had learned from our misfortunes. From the moment this man entered our apartment until his departure, he never ceased swearing. \" On the 2d of August, at two o'clock in the morning, we were awakened from our sleep in order that the decree of the Convention might be read to my mother, by which it was ordered that, upon the requisition of the procureur general of the Commune, she was to be removed to the Conciergerie, to stand her trial. She heard this decree read without saying a single word. \" My aunt and I both instantly demanded to be allowed to accompany my mother, but this grace was denied us. While she was making a bundle of her clothes, the muni cipal officers did not leave her for a moment : she was even obliged to dress herself in their presence. They asked her for her pockets, which she gave to them ; they searched through them, and took everything they con tained, though there was nothing of the slightest im portance. They made a parcel of them, which they told her they would send to the Revolutionary Tribunal, where it would be opened in her presence. They left her nothing but a handkerchief and a smelling-bottle, and the latter through fear lest she might be taken ill. My mother, having first tenderly embraced me and ex horted me to take courage, \u2014 to pay every attention to my aunt and to obey her as a second mother, \u2014 repeated to me the religious instructions I had before received from my father, and then, throwing herself into the arms of my aunt, she recommended her children to her care. \"I could not utter a word in reply, so overwhelmed was I at the thought that it might be the last time I should see her ; my aunt said a few words to her in a"], [461, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 393 low voice of anguish and despair. My mother then hastened from the room, without casting another look towards us, fearful, no doubt, lest her firmness should desert her. She was stopped for some time at the bot tom of the stairs, while the municipal officers drew up a prods-verbal for the keeper of the prison, as a discharge for her person. She got into a carriage with a municipal officer and two gendarmes. On her arrival at the Con ciergerie, she was put into the filthiest and the most unwholesome room in the entire prison. She was con stantly kept in sight by a gendarme, who never left her for a moment, either by day or by night. My aunt and I were inconsolable at her absence, and spent our days and nights in bitter weeping. My aunt had, however, been assured, on my mother's departure, that nothing in the world would be done to her. \" It was a great consolation for me that I was not sep arated from my aunt, whom I loved so very much ; but, alas ! another change soon took place, and I lost her also ! The day following my mother's removal my aunt made a demand, in the most pressing terms, both in her own name and in mine, to have us again united to my mother ; but her request was denied, and we were not even per mitted to keep up any communication with her. A few days after, my mother, as an opportunity of hearing something of us, sent for some things she wanted, and, among others, for her knitting-instruments, to finish a pair of stockings that she had begun to make for my brother. We sent them to her, together with all the silk and wool we could find, as we knew how much she liked to be occupied : she had always, formerly, been in the habit of working constantly, except when she ap peared in public. In this manner she had made a great quantity of furniture, a carpet, and had knit each of us"], [462, "394 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. articles of different kinds. We therefore collected all the materials we could ; but we afterwards learned that none of them had ever reached her, they being afraid, as we were told, lest she should endeavor to put an end to herself with the needles. \"We sometimes received intelligence of my brother through the municipal officers, but even that did not last long. We heard him every day singing, in company with Simon, the song of La Carmagnole, and a thousand other horrible compositions. Simon dressed him in a red cap and a carmagnole [a small tight jacket], and made him sing at the windows so as to be heard by the guard, and taught him to utter the most dreadful blasphemies and curses against God, his family, and the aristocrats. Happily for my unfortunate mother, she did not hear all these horrors ; oh, my God ! what would she have suf fered had she been exposed to so dreadful a trial ! Be fore her removal a person had been sent to her to get my brother's clothes. She had observed that she hoped he was not going to take off his mourning. But the very first thing that Simon did was to strip him of his black coat. The change in his mode of life, and the bad treatment he experienced, rendered my brother very ill. Simon gave him the coarsest food to eat, and made him, by force, drink a quantity of wine, which he naturally detested. All these things combined to throw him soon into a fever ; he took a medicine which disagreed very much with him, and his health became entirely destroyed. He grew extremely fat, without increasing at all in height: Simon, however, still took him to the outside of the tower to take the air. \" I never heard the drum beat, without dreading that it was a renewal of the awful 2d of September. Notwith standing the severity of our keepers, we always found"], [463, "395 THE REIGN OF TERROR. some compassionate souls who felt an interest in our fate. We learned that my mother was accused of hav ing kept up a correspondence with the foreign enemy. We immediately threw away all the written papers we had with us, our pencils, and everything we had hitherto concealed, as we were afraid lest we should be forced to undress before Simon's wife, and that the things we had might compromise my mother's safety ; for we had still preserved some ink and paper, pens and pencils, notwith standing the close searches that had been made in our rooms, and even in the furniture of our apartment. We also learned that my mother had had an opportunity of effecting her escape, and that the wife of the jailer was a kind-feeling woman, and treated her with care and atten tion. \" The municipal officers came to ask us for linen for my mother, but at the same time refused to give us any account of her health. The pieces of embroidery that she had worked were taken from us, and also those at which we were working, under the pretext that these pieces of work might be intended to contain mysterious characters, and a particular manner of writing. On the 21st of September, at one o'clock in the morning, Hebert arrived at the Temple, accompanied by several municipal officers, for the purpose of executing a decree of the Commune, by which it was directed that we should be confined much more strictly than hitherto ; that we should no longer have more than one room ; that Tison, who still continued to do the coarse work, should be put in prison in the turret ; that our accommodation should be reduced to what was strictly necessary ; that a turn ing-box should be made in the outside door, through which our food should be passed ; and, in fine, that, with the exception of the water-carrier and the wood-porter,"], [464, "396 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. no person whatever should be allowed to enter our room. The turning-box was not made, and the municipal offi cers continued to enter our room three times a day, to make a careful examination of the bars of our windows, of our presses and drawers. We made our beds our selves, and were obliged to sweep the room, which took us a long time to do at first, until we got accustomed to it. We had no one now to wait upon us. Hehert said to my aunt, that, under the French Republic, equality was the first of laws, and that, as the other prisoners had no one to wait upon them, he would take Tison from us. \" As an augmentation of the severity with which we were treated, we were deprived of everything that could be of the slightest comfort or convenience to us. They did not even leave us what was necessary. When our meals were brought, the door was instantly clapped to, lest we should see the persons who brought them. We had now no opportunity of hearing anything, except through the porters, and the information we thus obtained was very rare and trifling, although we listened with avidity to everything. We were prohibited from walking on the turret, on the pretext that we would attempt to escape through the windows, notwithstanding they were secured by bars. The linen that was given to us was of the coarsest and filthiest description. \" I believe it was at this time the trial of the queen began. I heard that a plan had been formed for rescu ing her from the Conciergerie, but that, unfortunately, the project had not succeeded. I have been since told that the gendarmes who guarded her, and the jailer's wife, had been previously gained over by some of her friends ; that she had seen in her prison several persons who were wholly devoted to her. The chance of escape"], [465, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 397 was lost on one occasion by her speaking to the first guard in mistake for the second. Another time she had gotten out of her room, and had already passed the cor ridor, when she was met by a gendarme who opposed her departure, though he had been bribed, and obliged her to return to her apartment, and thus caused the failure of this attempt. A great number of persons interested themselves in the fate of my mother ; and, in fact, unless with monsters of the vilest species, such as she but too unfortunately met with, it was impossible to approach her without being moved by a sentiment of respect, so highly was the imposing dignity of her manners tem pered by the kindness and mild benevolence of her heart. We were entirely ignorant of all these details at the time ; the only thing that we knew was, that my mother had seen a chevalier of St. Louis, who had succeeded in passing her a few lines, concealed in a carnation ; but the extreme severity with which we were confined pre vented our learning anything more. \" We were visited, and our apartment searched every day by the municipal officers, and on the 4th of Septem ber they came at four o'clock in the morning, for the purpose of making a complete search, and to take away our plate and porcelain. They found behind the drawers of my aunt's bureau a rouleau of louis, which they instantly fell upon with extraordinary avidity. They interrogated my aunt closely, for the purpose of ascertaining who had given her this gold. She replied that it was Madame the Princesse de Lamballe, who had given it to her after the 10th of August, and that, notwithstanding the fre quent searches that had been made, she had contrived to keep it concealed. \" At twelve o'clock on the 8th of October, as we were engaged in making up our rooms, and in dressing our-"], [466, "398 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. selves, we were surprised by a visit from Pache, Chau mette, and David, three members of the Convention, accompanied by several municipal officers. Pache, ad dressing me, requested me to go down stairs. My aunt begged to accompany me, but she was told to remain. She asked whether I was to return. Chaumette assured her that I was, saying, ' You may depend upon the word of a good republican \u2014 she shall return.' I embraced my aunt, who was trembling with fear, and went down; I was very much embarrassed ; it was the first time I had ever found myself alone in company with men, but I recommended myself to God. On descending the stair case, Chaumette addressed some polite phrases to me, to which I made no reply. On arriving at my brother's room, I tenderly embraced him ; but they tore him from my arms, and told me to pass on into the next room. Chaumette there made me sit down, and placed himself on a chair opposite me. One of the municipal officers took the pen, and Chaumette asked me my name. Hebert then began to interrogate me, beginning thus : \u2014 \" ' Tell the truth ; it concerns neither yourself nor your family.' \" ' Does it concern my mother ? ' \" ' No ; but some persons who have not done their duty. Do you know the citizens Toulan, Lepitre, Breno, Merle, Brugnot, and Michonis ? ' \" ' No.' \" ' What, you do not know them ? ' \" ' No, sir.' \" ' It is false ; particularly with regard to Toulan, the small-sized young man who used to come so frequently to the Temple.' \" ' I have no acquaintance with him, no more than with the others.'"], [467, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 399 \" ' Do you remember one day that you remained with your brother alone in the turret ? ' \" ' I do.' \" ' Did not your parents send you there that they might speak with more ease to those men ? ' \" ' No, sir ; but in order to accustom us to the cold.' '\"What did you both do while you were in this turret ? ' \" ' We talked and played.' \" ' And, on leaving it, did you take notice of what these men gave your parents ? ' \" ' I did not see them give anything.' \" Chaumette then examined me respecting a thousand disgusting things of which my mother and aunt were accused. I was completely overcome at these insulting questions, and was so indignant that, notwithstanding the terror I was in, I could not prevent myself from saying that it was an infamous calumny and falsehood. They, however, continued to press these questions on me, entirely regardless of my tears and my distress. They said some things to me, the sense of which I did not understand, but what I did comprehend was so horrible that I shuddered and wept with indignation. He then interrogated me respecting Varennes, and asked me sev eral questions which I answered as well as I could, but without compromising any one. \"I have been told that my mother's examination lasted three days and three nights without interruption. She was forced to hear all the insulting questions that Chau mette had before put to us, the very thought of which could only have suggested itself to monsters. ' / appeal to every mother,' was the reply that she made to this in famous accusation. All around were moved at this affecting answer, and the judges, alarmed at this appear-"], [468, "400 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ance of sympathy, and dreading lest her firmness, her dignified conduct, and her courage, should excite an in terest in her fate, hastened to find her guilty, and to sentence her to death. My mother heard the fatal war rant with great calmness. A priest who had taken the oaths was appointed to attend her in her last moments, but she mildly declined his ministrations. She knelt down alone, prayed to God for a considerable time, was then attacked with a fit of coughing, after which she went to bed and slept for a few hours. The next day, knowing that the cure of St. Margaret was confined in a part of the prison opposite to her cell, she approached the window, and directing her looks towards the window of his room, fell upon her knees and prayed. I have been told that he gave her absolution, or his blessing, while in this position. After devoting her soul to God, she went to the scaffold with courage, amidst the impre cations of the misguided mob. Her courage never failed her, either in the fatal cart or on the scaffold. The same intrepidity that distinguished her during her lifetime, she displayed at her death. \"Thus died, on the 16th of October, 1793, Marie- Antoinette-Jeanne-Josephe of Lorraine, daughter of an emperor, and wife of a king of France. She perished at the age of thirty-seven years and eleven months, twenty three years of which she had spent in France. She died eight months after her husband, Louis XVI. \" I had frequently heard my parents say that it was better to die oneself than to compromise the life of an other. At length, at three o'clock, they ceased interro gating me. I besought Chaumette to allow me to see my mother. But he replied that it was not in his power to grant it. He then had me conducted back to my chamber by three municipal officers, having first commanded me"], [469, "THE QUEEN BEFORE THE REVOLUTION ARV TRIBUNAL."], [470, ""], [471, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 401 not to say anything to my aunt, who was also going to be examined. On reaching my room I threw myself into her arms ; but we were immediately separated, and she was led down stairs. \" The same questions I had been asked were put to her. She denied our having any correspondence outside, and replied, with still more contempt, to the disgusting things respecting which they interrogated her. She came back at four o'clock. Her interrogatory had lasted only one hour, and mine three. The fact was, the deputies soon saw that they could not intimidate her, as they hoped to do with a person of my age ; but the life I had been lead ing for the last four years, together with the example of my parents, had given me a strength of mind above my years. \" My aunt and I were kept in ignorance of the fate of my mother ; and although we heard her sentence of death cried under our windows by the hawkers, yet hope, so natural to the unfortunate, made us still think that she had been saved. We learned, through means of the hawkers, the death of the Duke of Orleans: this was the only intelligence that reached us during the winter. \"In the month of November, positive orders were issued to have our room examined three times a day. One of these visits lasted from four until half after eight o'clock in the evening. The four municipal officers who made this search were completely intoxicated. One may imagine what vile language, what insults, and what blas phemies we were exposed to listen to for four hours. They took from us the most trifling matters, such as our bonnets, some playing-cards stamped with a king's figure, and some books with arms printed in them ; they, however, left us our religious books, but not without uttering a thousand blasphemies and horrors. Simon"], [472, "402 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. accused us of making forged assignats, and of keeping up a correspondence outside the prison. He asserted that we had been in communication with my father dur ing his trial. He made a declaration to this effect in the name of my poor little brother, whom he forced to sign it. The noise which he pretended to come from our coining money, was that of our game of trictrac, which my aunt had the kindness to teach me as a sort of dis traction to our grief. On the 19th of January we heard a great noise in my brother's room, from which we con jectured that they were removing him from the Temple, and we were confirmed in this belief when we saw them, through the key-hole, carrying away a bundle of things. We also heard, on the succeeding days, the frequent sound of the opening of his door, and of persons walk ing in his room, so that we remained persuaded of his departure. I have since learned, however, that it was the removal of Simon that caused this bustle. Being forced to choose between the place of municipal officer and that of my brother's keeper, he preferred accepting the first. I have also since learned that they had the cruelty to leave my poor brother entirely alone ; an un heard-of barbarity, which surely has never had its parallel, thus to abandon an unhappy child of eight years of age, who was already in a dreadful state of health, and to keep him shut up in his chamber, under locks and bolts, with out any assistance, except what he might procure by means of a bell, which he never rang, so great was his dread of the persons whom he knew would answer it, and preferring to do everything he wanted, rather than apply for the most trifling thing to his persecutors. He was in a bed which had not been once made for more than six months, and which he had not himself sufficient strength to turn ; this bed was covered with fleas and"], [473, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 403 bugs, of which his linen and his clothes were also full. He was obliged to wear the same shirt and stockings for upwards of a year, and during the whole of that time his room was never swept nor any of the accumulated filth removed. His window, being secured with a padlock in addition to the bars outside, was not once opened, and indeed it was impossible to remain in his room on account of the infectious smell. It is true that my brother him self neglected these matters, that he might have taken a little more care of his person, as he was allowed a pitcher of water for the purpose ; but his age must be considered, and his great fear, so that he did not dare to ask for any thing, so great was his dread of Simon and his other keepers. During the day, even in the company of Simon, he was not permitted to occupy himself, nor was he allowed to have any light during the night. As was naturally to be expected, he sank under such treatment, and gradually fell into a terrible consumption ; indeed, it is only surprising that he continued for so long a time in health, and resisted the effects of such cruel treat ment.\" M. Hue, in his \"Last Years of Louis XVI.,\" gives the following account of the cruel treatment to which the poor little prince was subjected : \u2014 \" Louis XVII. , after being torn from the arms of the queen, had been removed to a remote part of the tower which the king had occupied. There this young prince, whom some of the regicides called by the name of the wolf 's-cub of the Temple, was delivered up to the brutal treatment of a monster named Simon, who had formerly been a cobbler, a drunken, debauched gamester. The tender years, the innocence, the misfortunes, the angel features, the languid sickliness, and the tears of the royal child, all failed in softening the heart of the fero-"], [474, "404 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. cious keeper. One day, in a fit of drunkenness, he struck the child with a napkin, and narrowly missed tearing out the eye of the prince, whom, by a refinement of insult, he forced to wait upon him at the table. He also beat him constantly in the most cruel manner. \" One day, in a fit of rage, he seized one of the fire irons, and, levelling it at his head, he threatened to strike him to the ground. The ears of the unhappy prince, the successor of so many kings, were constantly assailed by the grossest language and the most obscene songs. \" ' Capet,' said Simon to him one day, ' if these Ven deans were to come, what would you do ? ' \" ' I would pardon you,' replied the young king.\" But we will return to the narration of Madame Royale. \"Nothing worthy of remark took place up to the 9th of May. On that day, at the moment when we were get ting into bed, the outside bolts were drawn, and some persons knocked at our door. My aunt called out to say that she was putting on her gown ; they replied that it could not take her so long, and then pushed the door with so much violence that they almost burst it in. My aunt opened it the moment she was dressed. They said to her, ' Citizen, will you accompany us down stairs ? ' \" ' And my niece ? ' \" ' She shall be taken care of afterwards.' \" My aunt embraced me, and told me to calm my agita tion, that she would soon return. ' No, citizen,' said one of the men to her, ' you will not return ; put on your bonnet and go down stairs.' They then loaded her with the coarsest and most insulting language ; she bore it all with patience, put on her bonnet, embraced me once more, and told me to take courage and be firm, \u2014 to place my hope in God, \u2014 to live in the good principles of religion"], [475, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 405 which my parents had inculcated, and to keep constantly in my mind the last advice of my father and my mother. She then departed. On reaching the bottom of the stairs they asked her for her pockets, in which they could find nothing. She was delayed there a long time while the municipal officers were drawing up a proces-verbal as a discharge for her person. \" At length, after undergoing a thousand insults, she left the prison, in company with an officer of the tribunal, got into a hackney-coach, and arrived at the Conciergerie, where she passed the night. The following day she was asked three questions : \u2014 \" ' Your name ? ' \"'Elizabeth of France.' \" ' Where were you on the 10th of August ? ' \"'At the palace of the Tuileries, with the king, my brother.' \" ' What has become of your diamonds ? ' \" ' I do not knoiv. All these questions are, however, use less; you leant my life ; I have offered up to God the sacri fice of my being, and I am prepared to die, happy at the thought of rejoining my revered brother and his wife, whom I loved so dearly when on earth.' \" She was condemned to death. She had herself con ducted into the room occupied by those who were to suffer along with her ; she exhorted them all to prepare for their approaching end, with a degree of self-posses sion, an elevation of soul, and a pious unction that im parted strength to their minds. During her passage in the fatal cart she preserved the same tranquillity, and supported the courage of the women who were with her. On reaching the foot of the scaffold, her murderers had the cruelty to make her wait until the last. The women who accompanied her, on getting out of the cart, all asked"], [476, "406 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. leave to embrace her, which she consented to with her usual kindness, at the same time encouraging them by her language. She retained all her firmness up to the last moment, which she suffered with a resignation founded on religious hope. \"Marie-Philippine-Elizabeth-Helene, sister to Louis XVI., died on the 10th of May, 1794, aged thirty years, having been all her life a model of every virtue. \"I remained in an utter state of desolation when I found myself separated from my aunt; I knew not what had become of her, and was unable to learn. The next day I asked the municipal officers what had been done with her ; they said that she had been to take the air. I then renewed my demand to be confined with my mother, as I was now separated from my aunt ; to which they replied that they would mention my request. Recollecting that my aunt had told me that, if I was ever left alone, I should immediately ask to have a woman to live with me, I accordingly did so. But on making this demand the municipal officers told me I had no occasion for any one. They redoubled their severity towards me, and took from me the knives that had been returned to me. They took also a tinder-box from me, and, finding the stove heated, they asked me, ' May one ask why you have made this fire ? ' \" ' To boil some water to bathe my feet.' \" ' How did you light the fire ? ' \"'With the tinder-box.' \" ' Who gave you this tinder-box ? ' \" ' I do not know.' \" ' To avoid all danger, then, we will take it from you ; it is for your sake only, lest you should fall asleep near the fire and burn yourself : have you anything else ? ' \" ' No, gentlemen.'"], [477, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 407 \"The visits and scenes of this description were fre quently renewed ; but, except when I was directly inter rogated, I never said a word, nor even spoke to those who brought me my meals. \" One day a man came to the prison, whom I believe was Robespierre : the municipal officers treated him with great respect. His visit was a secret from the people of the tower, who either did not know who he was or did not wish to tell me. He surveyed me with an air of insolence, cast his eyes over the books, and, after accompanying the officers in their search, he went away. The guards were frequently drunk ; however, they left my brother and me in a state of comparative tranquillity in our apartments until the 9th Thermidor. My brother was still sunk in the same state of filth and neglect. No one entered his room except at the hour of meals ; no pity whatever was shown to the unhappy child. The only person who seemed to have any com passion for him was one of the guards whose civil man ners induced me to recommend my poor brother to his kindness. He had the boldness to speak of the severity that was exercised towards him ; but he was deprived of his office, and dismissed from the prison the very next day. For myself I asked nothing but what was absolutely necessary, and even that was often refused to me in the roughest and most insulting manner. I however contrived, at least, to keep myself clean. I had soap and water; I swept my room every day, and had it entirely made up at nine o'clock, when the guards entered, bringing my breakfast. I was not allowed any light; but in the long days I did not much feel this privation. They refused to give me any other books \u2014 those I had were books of piety and travels, which I had read over and over many times. I also had a knit ting-machine, of which I was completely tired."], [478, "40S HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \"Such was our situation when the 9th Thermidor arrived, on which day I heard the drums beat and the tocsin sounded, which threw me into the greatest alarm. The municipal officers on guard at the Temple remained at their post. When they brought me my dinner, I was afraid to ask what was passing. At length, on the 10th Thermidor, at six o'clock in the morning, I heard a sud den noise and tumult in the Temple ; the guard were called to arms, the drums were beaten, and there was constant opening and shutting of doors. All this confu sion was occasioned by a visit from the members of the National Convention, who came to examine whether everything was right. I heard the bolts of my brother's room drawn and the door opened. I then threw myself out of bed, and was dressed and ready when the mem bers of the Convention came to my room. Barras was one of the number ; they were in full costume, which did not serve to calm my alarm, as I was not accustomed to see them dressed in this manner, and dreaded that something unusual was about to take place. Barras spoke to me, called me by my name, and expressed his surprise at seeing me already risen : several other things were said to me, to all of which I made no reply. They then left the room, and I soon heard them haranguing the guards immediately under our windows, and recom mending to them to be faithful to the National Con vention. They were interrupted by cries of ' Vive la Republique! Vive la Convention!' \" The guard was now doubled ; the three municipal officers who were at the Temple remained there for eight days. At the end of the third day, at half-past nine in the evening, having no light, I had retired to rest, but was unable to sleep from uneasiness to know what was going on abroad. They knocked at my door"], [479, "409 THE REIGN OF TERROR. and ordered me to open it, that I might be seen by Laurent, the commissary of the Convention, who was intrusted with the guard of my brother and myself. I rose from my bed : they made a diligent search, and carefully examined my apartment, at the same time showing everything to Laurent, and then went away. \"At ten o'clock the next morning, Laurent entered my room. He asked me in a polite tone whether I wanted anything. He came into my room three times a day, but always treated me with politeness and civility ; never addressing me with familiarity, nor showing me any disrespect. He never searched my desk or chest of drawers. The Convention sent a deputation, three days after, to ascertain the state of my brother's health ; the members of this commission took pity on his wretched condition, and gave orders for his better treatment. Laurent had a bed that was in my room removed into his, his own being full of bugs ; he also ordered baths to be prepared for him, and had him delivered from all the vermin with which he was covered : he was still, how ever, left alone in his room. I was soon emboldened to ask Laurent respecting what interested me so deeply, namely, the situation of my mother and my aunt, whose deaths I was ignorant of ; I also begged of him to have me restored to my mother. To these questions he replied, with an evident air of embarrassment and pain, that these were matters with which he had no concern. \" The next day I was visited by persons decorated with the official scarf, to whom I addressed the same ques tions. They also answered me that it was not their affair, and also said that they could not see why I was anxious to change my abode, as it seemed to them that I was very well off where I was. \" ' It is a dreadful thing,' said I to them, ' to be sepa-"], [480, "410 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. rated from one's mother for more than a year, without ever hearing anything of her, as also from one's aunt.' \" ' You are not sick ? ' \"'No, sir; but the severest illness is that of the heart.' \"'I have already told you to have patience, and to hope everything from the justice and the goodness of the French nation.' \" I made no further reply. \"During all this time my brother continued to remain alone. Laurent visited his room three times a day ; but being closely watched, and fearing to compromise his own safety, he could do nothing more. He was most attentive to me ; I have no reason whatever to find fault with his conduct towards me, but, quite the contrary, during all that time he was on duty at the Temple. He frequently asked me whether I wanted anything, and requested me to let him know what I wished for, and to ring the bell whenever I was in need of anything. He returned me the tinder-box, and gave me candles. \"About the beginning of November the civil com missaries arrived at the Temple, whose business it was to report on the state of my brother. About the same time, another commissary, named Gomier, was appointed to share the duties of Laurent. He took the greatest care of my brother. For a long time this poor child had been denied the use of candle-light, and suffered dread fully from fear. Gomier obtained permission to allow him a light when it became dark, and was even kind enough to spend some hours with him, to amuse him and distract his thoughts. He soon observed that my brother's knees and wrists were swelled ; he feared he would soon grow rickety, and spoke of the matter to the committee, to whom he represented the necessity of allowing him to"], [481, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 411 take some exercise in the garden. He at first took him from his room into the outer sitting-room, which gave my poor brother great pleasure, as the change of place was an amusement to him. He soon felt all the kind ness of Gomier's attentions to him, and became warmly attached to him. The unfortunate child had been for a long time accustomed to the very worst of treatment ; I believe there never was an instance of such barbarity being exercised towards a child. On the 19th of Decem ber the General Committee came to the Temple, on account of his illness. This deputation also paid a visit to my room, but they said nothing to me. \" The winter passed with tolerable tranquillity, and I had reason to be satisfied with the civility of my keep ers : they offered to make my fire, and allowed me as much wood as I wished, which was a source of great comfort to me. They also brought me the books I asked for. Laurent had already procured me some. The greatest distress I had was, in not being able to learn anything respecting my mother or my aunt ; I did not dare to inquire about my uncles or my grand-aunts, but I never ceased to think of them. \"My brother had occasional attacks of fever during the winter ; he remained constantly seated close to the fire. Laurent and Gomier prevailed upon him to take the air on the top of the tower, but he had scarcely got there before he wished to return, it was so painful to him to walk, and still more to go up stairs : his illness in creased, and his knees became very much swelled. \"Laurent was replaced by Loine, an excellent good man, who joined Gomier in taking every care of my brother. As soon as the spring began, they advised me to walk upon the tower, which I did. My brother's ill ness increased from day to day ; his strength became"], [482, "412 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. gradually diminished, and even his mind suffered from the effects of the cruel treatment that had been so long exercised towards him, and he showed symptoms of in creasing mental weakness. The Committee of General Safety sent the physician Dessault to attend him, who undertook to cure him, though he at the same time assured them that his disorder was very dangerous. Dessault died, and was succeeded by Dumangin and sur geon Pellatan, who, from the moment they saw him, never entertained any hopes of his recovery, but gave him some medicines which he swallowed with great diffi culty. Happily, he did not generally suffer much pain during his illness ; it was more a total decay and exhaus tion than a violent attack ; but latterly, he had several crises, during which he suffered greatly. He was at last attacked with fever, from which time his strength daily faded away, until the 9th of June, when he expired with out agony. \" Thus died on the 9th of June, 1795, at three o'clock in the afternoon, Louis XVIL, at the age of ten years and two months. The commissaries shed bitter tears of regret at his untimely fate : his amiable qualities had gained their hearts. He naturally possessed an excel lent understanding, but his long imprisonment, and the horrible treatment of which he was the victim, gradu ally affected his mind ; and, even had he lived, it is prob able he would never have recovered from the effects of it. I do not believe that he was poisoned, as has been said, and as some persons still suppose : this report is proved to be unfounded by the testimony of the physi cians who opened his body, in which they found no traces whatever of poison. The medicines that were given to him in his last illness have been analyzed and have been found to be perfectly good. The only poison"], [483, "THE REIGN OF TERROR. 413 that cut short his days was the filth in which he was left, joined to the terrible treatment, to the cruelty, and to the unexampled barbarities that were exercised towards him. \"I have here attempted to delineate the lives of my virtuous and revered relations during their confinement in the Temple and the other prisons, as well as their un happy deaths.

The Assembly des patched to the departments and to the army, commis sioners charged with proclaiming the new Revolution, and with changing the civil and military authorities ; it recalled to the ministry Roland, Claviere, and Servan ; it appointed Monge, Lebrun, and Danton severally to be Ministers of Marine, Foreign Affairs, and Justice. \" The Commune, composed of two hundred and eighty eight members named by the forty-eight sections of Paris, had not been waiting for these decrees to act as master. It promulgated two hundred enactments daily : made short work of everything, and respected nothing. It suspended the directory of the department, transferred Louis and his family to the Temple prison, on the plea that the Luxembourg did not afford sufficient guarantees for their safety ; it imprisoned royalist journalists, and distributed their plant to the patriotic papers ; it ordered the destruction of all the statues and emblems of royalty ; it instituted a Watch Committee ; in fine, it raised upon the ruins of ancient despotism a tyranny tenfold more sanguinary and unjust. Night and day it held its sit tings. It was judge, jury, and executioner in one. \" The members of the Council-General of the Commune were chosen of the Paris mob, having no talents but a hot-headed revolutionary energy. Their idols were Robe spierre, Marat, and Danton, the last having, as he boasted. become a minister, ' through the breach made by the pat riots in the Tuileries.' A strong man, no doubt; a great man, scarcely ; deriving his ascendancy by pander ing to the vilest popular passions, which he himself shared to the utmost degree. He may have been, as he"], [486, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 416 said of himself, ' a revolutionist, because his mood urged him to be one.' He was a leader who could storm a citadel, but he lacked the inclination, if not the talents, to plan a properly conducted scheme. Robespierre had taken no part in the insurrection : during the struggle he had lain hidden somewhere. But the danger once past, he joined the General Council, where he soon gained the greatest ascendancy. \" Marat, without belonging to the Commune, had gra tuitously arrogated to himself the direction of the Watch Committee, which he ruled autocratically. His charac ter, briefly defined, was that of a 'fiend in human form.' There was but one punishment his mind could conceive for the least offence against the Revolution \u2014 - death. To inflict this punishment was demanded by him as the greatest happiness the Commune could bestow upon him. \" The Assembly, terror-stricken at the usurpations of the Commune, endeavored to reinstate the former Paris municipality, but had to give way ; the Commune threat eningly suggesting that its re-establishment would be followed by another attempt of the people at revenge.\" Meanwhile the ambassadors from the various foreign countries had left France, which found itself ostracized by all the Great Powers, and attacked by Austria, Prus sia, Piedmont, the three Episcopal Electors, and the Landgrave of Hesse. The army of the Allies, com manded by the Duke of Brunswick, and accompanied by Frederick William, started from Coblentz on the 30th of July ; but its progress being slow, it did not pass the frontier until the 19th of August. The town of Lono-wy, after a bombardment of fifteen hours, capitulated, Au<mst 23d, and the Allies marched on to Verdun, between which city and Paris there was no other fortified place."], [487, "417 THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. The news of these reverses threw the capital into great excitement. The French army was disorganized by the accusation and flight of La Fayette ; the Royalists were rearing their heads threateningly all around, while the Prussians were boasting that \"treason would do more for them than valor.\" The Assembly, hardly knowing what course to pursue, decreed that whoever should propose to surrender a for tified place should be put to death ; that thirty thousand men should be enrolled from Paris and adjacent places to encamp as a defence at Montmartre. The Assembly also endeavored to regain its power by annulling the insur rectionary Commune, and ordering the sections to elect new commissioners to form a general provisional council. But the Commune heeded not these decrees of the As sembly, and proceeded forthwith to issue its own decrees ; namely, that the church-bells should be converted into cannon, the iron railings into pikes, the silver vessels of the churches should be melted down into money, and that the domiciliary visits should be made with greater vigor to discover hidden arms and arrest suspected per sons. By these measures about four thousand prisoners were made in one day ; and finding the prisons of Paris were becoming crowded beyond their capacity, the Com mune formed the diabolical plan of massacring the prison ers in a mass. The people were in a state of perpetual frenzy. All business was prostrated. Armed men filled the streets, and women sewed uniforms in the churches, and all work except that connected with military move ments was suspended. The ministers declared in the Assembly that in two weeks the Prussians would prob ably be beneath the walls of Paris. They recommended that the city should prepare to fight the enemy there, and in case of defeat the Assembly should retire upon the"], [488, "418 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Loire. Quickly Danton rose to his feet and exclaimed : \" To retreat would be ruin. We must maintain ourselves here at all cost, and save ourselves by audacity. We must frighten the Royalists ! \" As Danton thundered forth these words, his repulsive face was so terrible that beholders shuddered. He left the Assembly, proceeded to the Watch Committee, to which Marat had just been admitted, and there they concocted a \" St. Bartholomew against the Royalists.\" At length it was rumored that in three days the Prus sians would be in Paris. The city was wild with excite ment, and the people were ready for any desperate deed. Danton entered the Assembly and ascended the tribune. \"The enemy,\" said he, \"threatens the realm, and the Assembly must prove itself worthy of the nation. It is by a convulsion that we have overthrown despotism ; it is only by another vast national convulsion that we shall drive back the despots. It is time to urge the people to precipitate themselves en masse against their enemies. The French nation wills to be free, and it shall be.\" A decree was immediately passed for every citizen in Paris capable of bearing arms to repair to the Field of Mars, to be enrolled to march against the enemy. This was the morning of Sunday, September 2d. As the people were hurrying to the Field of Mars, bells ringing, drums beating, and arms clashing through the streets, the cry was raised that the Royalists in the prisons had formed a conspiracy to strike down their jailers, escape from prison, liberate the king and his family, rally their confederates around them, open the gates of Paris to the Prussians, proclaim the king, and condemn to death all the patriots who remained in Paris, and the wives and children of those who had marched against the Allies. As the populace, frenzied by these"], [489, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 419 reports, were vowing swift vengeance on the Royalists, news came that Verdun had surrendered to the Allies. At this moment twenty-four priests who had refused to take the oath were being conducted by Federate troops to the prison of the Abbaye. These priests were crowded into six carriages. The first carriage reached the prison ; but as the first priest alighted, the mob cried, \" Here are the traitors who intend to murder our wives and children while we are on the frontiers.\" The priests were all slaughtered ; and the people, now thirsty for blood, cried, \" To the Carmelites ! to the Car melites ! \" In this prison two hundred priests were imprisoned. The mob murdered them all but one. \"Now to the Abbaye ! \" exclaimed Maillard, the leader of this blood stained crew, as they dashed into the street and rushed towards the other prisons. The Abbaye was filled with debtors and convicts, as well as suspected aristocrats. As Maillard with his ferocious band entered the prison, the jailer said to him: \"My friends, you wish to destroy the aristocrats, who are the enemies of the people, and who meant to murder your wives and children while you were at the frontiers. You are right no doubt ; but you are good citizens ; you love justice ; and you would be very sorry to steep your hands in innocent blood. When you are rushing like furious tigers upon men who are strangers to you, are you not liable to confound the inno cent with the guilty ? \" The mob seemed somewhat impressed by these words, and it was hastily decided that Maillard should judge each prisoner. He accord ingly took his seat at a table ; the prison list was given to him, and as he read each name the prisoner was brought before him, and was judged by this impromptu and unjust tribunal, wnich was only a mockery of law"], [490, "420 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. and justice. It was decided amongst the assassins that when one was condemned to death, the judge should say, \" Sir, you must go to the prison of La Force \" ; and as soon as the prisoner was led out of the building, he should be cruelly butchered. At La Force this same mock-trial was gone through with, the only change being in the words of condemnation, which were that the condemned should be told he was to be taken to the Abbaye. All night long these shocking scenes continued. The band of bloodthirsty monsters went from prison to prison, until from eight to twelve thousand human beings were thus foully murdered. At last, after the prisons were emptied, and the fiendish butchers were weary of blood, the Commune issued orders that no more persons should be massacred. But assuming that this atrocious work of assassination was demanded by the public welfare, the Commune declared that the brutal wretches who had performed these hellish deeds had fulfilled a patriotic though painful duty, and the Commune rewarded the murderers, and sent out a cir cular to all the Communes in France, upholding this diabolical deed. Regarding these massacres in the Paris prisons, we have collected a few facts narrated by an eye-witness of these revolting scenes, which relate the awful story, with appalling vividness ; and though many of tho atrocities committed are too dreadful to describe, these we have selected will portray with sufficient details the blood curdling horrors of those terrible September days. Mer cier, in his \" Nouveau Tableau de Paris,\" says : \" The generations of future times will not believe that these execrable crimes could take place among a civilized peo ple, in the presence of the Legislative Body, under the"], [491, "MASSACRE OF THE PRIESTS."], [492, ""], [493, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 421 eyes, and by the will of the depositaries of the laws, in a city peopled by eight hundred thousand inhabitants, who remained motionless and frozen with terror at the sight of a band of wretches hired for the commission of crime. The number of the assassins did not exceed three hun dred. The partisans of the massacres will hardly say that the diamonds, the jewels, etc., of the persons arrested were suspected. Yet they carefully took posses sion of both persons and things. This single fact alone, it appears to me, is sufficient to give a key to the massa cres. When the anarchists are asked why the Committee of Inspection ordered property to be carried off with the persons, they know not what to answer. \"On the 2d of September it was communicated to the Parisians that the city of Verdun had been taken by the Prussians. Guns of alarm were immediately fired, the ghxerale was beaten, and the tocsin sounded; several municipal officers on horseback hurried through the public places, confirmed the intelligence, and issued proclamations to excite the citizens to march against the enemy. At the first sound of the tocsin, people with reason asked each other why, on the least danger, the authorities seemed to take delight in thus spreading alarm in Paris, and in exciting the terror of the inhab itants, instead of endeavoring to arouse that virile en ergy which should characterize the soldier, and which tends to inspire a confidence of victory. But those who did not know the secret of the conspirators were too soon instructed by their own experience. Oh, day of mourning and reproach ! this was the signal that was to assemble the assassins, who hurried to the prisons on their hellish errands : this was the prelude of the most frightful carnage. \"The murderers separated into bands, went to the"], [494, "422 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. prisons. They burst open the doors of some; and at others, they made the jailers deliver themselves up, and took possession of the victims whom the Committee of Inspection had heaped up there during the preceding fifteen days. The assassins, armed with swords and other murderous instruments, with their sleeves turned up to their elbows, holding lists of proscription in their hands, drawn up several days before, called each prisoner by name. Several members of the Council-General, wear ing the tri-colored scarf, assembled in the turnkey's room within the prison. In the centre was placed a table covered with bottles and glasses, and around were grouped the pretended judges, and some of those who were to execute their sentences of death. In the middle of the table lay the book of commitments. The assas sins went from room to room, called each jirisoner in turn, and then led him before the tribunal of blood, which usually proposed this question to him : ' Who are you ? ' As soon as the prisoner had mentioned his name, the cannibals in scarfs inspected the register, and after some insignificant questions of a vague nature, they consigned him over to the satellites of their cruelties, who con ducted him to the door of the prison, where there were other assassins, who massacred him with a ferocity of which we should in vain seek for examples amongst the most barbarous nations. \"The Legislative Assembly deputed to several of its members authority to recall to the limits of the law the assassins who were deviating from it in such a hor rible manner. But what power could the language of reason and of morality have over assassins athirst for blood, most of whom were sunk into the most disgusting state of drunkenness ? This measure was insufficient : every harangue was ineffectual ; and to subdue the blood-"], [495, "MASSACRE IN THE PRISONS."], [496, ""], [497, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 423 thirsty tigers, an armed force would have been necessary. The Assembly itself was in a state of stupor and degra dation, being threatened with a total dissolution by the infamous Robespierre, who exercised an unlimited tyranny in Paris. \"And as for you, partisans of those massacres, fero cious conspirators, who have never ceased to deceive the credulous multitude, will you say that it was impossible to stay the hands of the assassins ? You have told the department, by the deceitful organ of your commissaries, that you had not been able to stop the fury of the peo ple. \" If it were not proved that to you alone belongs the opprobrium of the first days of September, I would recall to your recollection two facts which you cannot deny. I would remind you of the payment of eight hundred and fifty livres, made by order of the Council- General to the wine-dealer who supplied your assassins at La Force, during their horrible executions; I would remind you that, the day before the massacre, the Com mittee of Inspection hired the conveyances which it intended, and which were used, for carrying to the quarry of Charenton the dead bodies of the victims of September. \" The expenses incurred for these objects are included in official accounts of the Commune 'of Paris, and were paid by the Treasurer on account of the Council-General. If the National Guard had been required, \u2014 if it had been commanded in the name of the law, which perfidi ous and sanguinary leaders endeavored to paralyze, \u2014 how powerful and courageous would it not have been ? It would have risen at once in a mass ; but this National Guard, the majority of which remained pure in the midst of every kind of corruption and robbery, feared that it"], [498, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 424 might be accused of having acted without requisition ; it feared that, in wishing to punish crime, it might be accused of having rendered itself criminal ; restrained by these motives, it therefore remained inactive. \"I saw the Square of the Theatre-Francais covered with soldiers whom the tocsin had assembled; I saw them ready to march, yet suddenly disperse again, be cause it had been traitorously announced to them that it was only a false alarm ; that it was nothing. Good God! nothing! Already the court of the Cannes, and that of the Abbaye, were inundated with blood and filled with dead bodies, and yet it was nothing ! \" I saw three hundred armed men exercising in the Garden of the Luxembourg, at not more than two hun dred paces from the priests whom the assassins were murdering in the court of the Carmes ; will you affirm that they would not have stirred if they had received orders to march against the assassins ? \" This account of Mercier gives us a clearer insight into the atrocious guilt of the Commune of Paris than is else where narrated. From the \" History of the Revolution of the 10th of August,\" by Peltier, we take the following descriptions of the dreadful scenes in the Paris prisons during the brutal massacres of September : \u2014 \"For two days all the ecclesiastics in the Carmes, warned by numerous indications that they had only a very short time to live, had passed their last moments in mutually exhorting and blessing each other. Through the gratings and the windows which looked into the gar den, they saw the sabres and the pikes glittering, and they could hear the threats which were directed against them. About half-past three o'clock they were all made to leave the church indiscriminately, although it had been usual to allow the sick, the aged, and all those who wished"], [499, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 425 to engage in prayer to remain there. It was remarked that this was the third time that day that the names had been called over. \" Half an hour after the church had been emptied, the assassins entered it with their arms, in the midst of cries, oaths, and menaces. The door of the church, from which one descended by a staircase into the garden, was guarded by gendarmes, and was opened without any resistance ; but the principal door of the church, which opened into the Rue Vaugirard, remained closed during the whole of the execution. The people did not take the least share in it. \"At the time of the irruption into the garden, the un fortunate priests, to the number of one hundred and eighty-five, divided themselves into two groups. The former, composed of thirty persons, amongst whom were the three bishops, directed their steps towards a chapel or oratory which was at the extremity of the garden. They there knelt down, and implored the pardon of God for their offences, and blessed and embraced each other for the last time. Ten assassins advanced towards the chapel. One of the priests went to meet them ; he was about to address them, when a musket-ball deprived him of life. The assassins tumultuously demanded, ' Where is the Archbishop of Aries ? ' By his age and venerable appearance, so exactly answering the description they had received of him, one of the murderers recognized the prelate, and addressing him, said, ' It is thou, then, who art the Archbishop of Aries ? ' \"'Yes, gentlemen, I am.' \" ' Ah, unfortunate man ! it is thou who hast shed the blood of the patriots of Aries ? ' \" ' Gentlemen, I never shed the blood of a human being, nor did I ever do ill to any one in my life.'"], [500, "426 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" ' Well ! I am going to make thee shed blood now ! ' And instantly he struck the prelate a blow with his sabre on the forehead. The archbishop received it without shrieking. A second was aimed at his face ; after this second blow, the contraction which pain occasioned and the blood which flowed from the wound, disfigured the prelate so that even his colleagues could not recognize him. A third blow made him fall, and he supported his sinking body with his left hand, without uttering a com plaint or a murmur. As he was thus lying, one of the wretches thrust a pike into his bosom with such violence that the head of it remained in the wound. He then leaped upon the throbbing body, trampled upon it, plucked the watch from the pocket, and presented it to his comrades as a trophy of victory. The two other bishops were in the chapel with the rest of the priests, all kneeling at the foot of the altar ; a railing separated them from the assassins, who made several discharges among them, with the muzzles of their muskets almost touching the victims, and in this manner killed the major part of them ; but the Bishops of Beauvais and Saintes survived this first massacre, the latter having had his leg fractured with a ball. The band of assassins dispersed themselves in the garden, and joined those who were murdering the priests who were scattered about the vast enclosure. An atrocious spectacle was here pre sented, \u2014 men hunted down by their fellow-men like so many wild beasts. The victims were pursued in every direction. More than forty were thus slaughtered. When the assassins perceived that some escaped by scaling the walls and throwing themselves into the Rue Cassette, they sent two of their comrades into that street, and there, with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other, they pursued those who attempted to escape in that way."], [501, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 427 \" The firing in the garden had continued about a quar ter of an hour, when a man, who was the chief director of this massacre, ran towards the murderers, and made them cease firing, by exclaiming, ' Gentlemen, it is not thus that you must act ; you go awkwardly about it ; do what I shall tell you.' Upon these words he ordered that all the priests should be made to go into the church. They then drove back, with the flat part of their sabres, all those who still breathed. The two bishops were of the number. The Bishop of Saintes, already wounded, was taken in the arms of the assassins, and placed tem porarily upon a bed. There were still at this time about a hundred priests. The manager of this new man\u0153uvre then gave orders to take them, two by two, and to lead them back a second time into the garden, and as they descended the staircase, the assassins stationed at the foot massacred them, one after another. \"When the turn of the Bishop of Beauvais arrived, they went to bring him from the foot of the altar in the church, which he held clasped with his arms. He serenely arose and went to his fate. The Bishop of Saintes was one of the last who was asked for. The gendarmes on guard surrounded his bed, which at first gave some trouble in finding him. These men, who were equal in number to the assassins, suffered him to be carried away. He could not walk, and replied to his executioners, who ordered him to follow them, ' Gentle men, I do not refuse to go to death like the others, but you see the state in which I am ; I have one of my legs broken ; I pray you to assist me, and I will willingly go to my execution.' Two assassins supported him under their arms to the staircase, where he received the blow of martyrdom. \" The massacre ended at eight o'clock in the evening ;"], [502, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with the exception of one priest, who had concealed himself under a mattress. He was discovered there while the assassins were terminating their crime by a debauch, and were drinking with the gendarmes, dancing at the same time the Carmagnole. This unfor tunate priest was the only one who perished in the church. When the massacre was consummated, an order was given to open the doors of the church, that the people might enter and give this horrible catastrophe a sort of popular legislation. The fate of these unhappy priests had been so definitively settled for several days that the grave digger of the parish of St. Sulpice had received in advance an assignat of a hundred crowns, in order to prepare, at Mont Rouge, the grave which was to receive their bodies. They were deposited there the next morn ing. Ten wagons carried the corpses to the place. \" The cloister of the Bernardines was the depot whither had been transferred the prisoners destined for the gal leys, from the tower St. Bernard, before its destruction. Seventy-three prisoners were murdered there. The car nage lasted the longest, and was the most bloody and horrible, at the Hospital Bicetre. This prison was the den of every vice ; it was the sink of Paris. All it con tained were killed. It would be impossible to fix the number of the victims ; I have often heard it estimated at six thousand. The work of death did not cease for a moment during eight consecutive days and nights. Pikes, sabres, and muskets not sufficing for the fero city of the assassins, they were obliged to employ can non. Two sections suffered them to take those which were confided to them for the protection of their fellow creatures. For the first time, prisoners were there seen defending their dungeons and their chains. The resist ance was long and sanguinary ; at length the assassins"], [503, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 429 by the following means, became superior. They enclosed in a court a certain number of malefactors and secured the gates ; they then procured a cannon, and, while they appeared to point it to the angle of the court where the greatest number of the prisoners were assembled, the latter fled to another side to avoid the fire, when the direction of the piece was suddenly changed, and the flying group were fired on with grape-shot. The more rapidly the victims fell, the greater the joy and the laughter of the assassins became ; and when at last there remained but a small number of prisoners, which they would have been long in destroying with the cannon, they had recourse to small-arms. In fact, the reptiles had devised a new sort of amusement : that of firing on their fellow-men running: \" At the close of the massacres, Petion, who had not repaired either to the Carmes or to the Abbaye, went to the Bicetre. There his compassion was for the first time excited at the sight of the slaughtered victims. The cannonading had ceased. The prisoners who remained to be put to death had taken refuge in the cellars, the cells, and the vaults, where the cannon, and even the light of day, could not reach them ; the assassins were occupied in drowning them with pumps, in these subter raneous retreats. Potion spoke to them of humanity and philosophy. The murderers, who found it quite as phil osophical to finish these unhappy beings as those of the Abbaye, for whom they had not seen Potion make inter cession, harshly repulsed the mayor of Paris. Petion, in leaving them, addressed to them the following words : ' Well, my good fellows, put an end to it.' However dread ful the expression may be, it is only the parallel to that which he addressed to the furies of the 20th of June, when he said to them under the eyes of the king, ' Citi-"], [504, "430 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. zens, you have conducted yourselves with wisdom and dignity.' \"The Swiss officers, who were at the Abbaye, had been transferred to the Conciergerie. Their trials had commenced at the Revolutionary Criminal Tribunal, by that of the brave Bachmann, their major. He was then upon his trial, and these judges were holding their sit ting, when the carnage of the prisoners began in their presence, at the door of the tribunal, \u2014 at the very foot of the great staircase which led' to it, \u2014 and they did not attempt to prevent it. They showed some respect to the Swiss major, who was then under process of trial ; but only because they well knew that his punishment was certain. He was preserved only that his punishment might be increased by the sight of the slaughter of his eight comrades, and they were in hopes that they might be able to draw from him some confessions against the queen. But the man who had seen approach, without alarm, the 10th of August, naturally contemplated, with out emotion, the 2d of September. Bachmann, silent and cold, answered nothing, and did not condescend to discuss his innocence, of which he would have felt ashamed; he demanded death, and received it like a hero. Enveloped in his red cloak, he mounted the scaf fold with a firm step, gazed with disdain upon the mob surrounding it, uttered these prophetic words : ' My death ivill be revenged ! ' and his head fell. \" The H6tel of La Force, which was divided into sev eral buildings, had been chosen as an addition to the pris ons of the Abbaye and Chatelet, which were so crowded that they could receive no more prisoners. An individ ual named Truchon, commissary of the Commune, came to the Committee of Twenty-one, who were still assem bled, to make his report, that the massacres having be^un"], [505, "431 THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. at the prison of La Force, he had thought it his duty to permit the women to go out ; and that he had set at lib erty twenty-four of them ; that among these were Made moiselle de Tourzel and Madame de St. Brice, whom, however, from prudent motives, he had conducted to the section of the Droits de I' Homme, to await their sentence there. The extraordinary Commission troubled them selves no further with the fate of these two persons, or with that of the Princesse de Lamballe, or of the other ladies whom Truchon had thought proper to leave at La Force. \"The Princesse de Lamballe, a widow at eighteen, free from any suspicion of levity, above all ambition and every interest from her rank and fortune, loved the queen as a friend. The more adverse were the fortunes of Marie Antoinette, the more did her young favorite desire to share them with her. It was not greatness, but misfortune, that attracted her. She lodged in the Tuileries, in an apartment adjacent to the queen, to share her tears and her dangers. She was sometimes obliged to be absent in order to go to the Chateau de Vernon to watch over the old Due de Penthievre. The queen, who foresaw the coining storm, had written to her, some days before the 20th of June, a touching letter, entreating her not to return. This letter, found in the hair of the Princesse de Lamballe, after her assassination, discloses the tenderness of the one and the devotion of the other.\" \" Do not leave Vernon, my dear Lamballe, before you are perfectly recovered. The good Due de Penthievre would be sorry and distressed, and we must all take care of his advanced age, and respect his virtues. I have so often told you to take heed to yourself, that if you love me, you must think of yourself : we shall require all our"], [506, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 432 strength in the times in which we live. Oh, do not return, or return as late as possible. Your heart would be too deeply wounded ; you would have too many tears to shed over my misfortunes, you who love me so ten derly. This race of tigers which infests the kingdom would cruelly enjoy itself if it knew all the sufferings we undergo. Adieu, my dear Lamballe ! I am always thinking of you, and you know I never change.\" Contrary to this advice, the courageous princess made all haste to return to the side of her afflicted queen, and by so doing she subsequently paid for her fidelity with her own life. Amidst all the terrible scenes which occurred at these awful September massacres, none are so shocking as the murder of the Princesse de Lamballe. Her sincere attachment to Marie Antoinette was her only crime. She had played no political part in the agitations of those times, and she was known to the people only by her numerous acts of benevolence and kindness. This unfortunate princess, having been spared in the massa cres of the 2d, had laid herself down upon her bed, in the evening, worn out with grief and horror. Soon two guards entered her apartment and informed her that she must prepare to go to the Abbaye. The princess replied that she preferred to remain in the prison where she was then confined. One of guards then told her that she must obey, as her life depended upon it. Throwing her robe hurriedly about her, she descended with the guard into the turnkey's room, where she found two municipal officers, wearing the tri-colored scarf, sitting in judgment upon the prisoners summoned before them. On being brought face to face with this dreadful tri bunal, surrounded by bands of assassins whose brutal"], [507, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 433 countenances and disordered clothes were covered with blood, her horror was so great that she fainted several times. When she recovered sufficiently to speak, her examination began. \"Who are you ?\" she was asked. \" Maria Louisa, Princess of Savoy.\" \" Your employment ? \" \" Superintendent of the household of the queen.\" \" Had you any knowledge of the plots of the court on the 10th of August ? \" \"I know not whether there were any plots on the 10th of August, but I know that I had no knowledge of them.\" \"Swear liberty, equality, hatred of the kiug, of the queen, and of royalty.\" \" I will readily swear the two former ; I cannot swear the latter; it is not in my heart.\" (Here one present said to her in a whisper : \" Sivear ! if you do not swear, you are dead.\") The princess did not reply. The judge then said, \" Let madame be set at liberty.\" But this deceitful phrase only meant rather the signal for her death. As she was led to the door, some one recommended her to cry Vive la. Nation! but the sight of the piles of dead bodies in all their ghastly horror so terrified her that she cried, \" I am lost ! \" Scarcely had she passed the threshold of the door, when she was struck on the back of the head with a sabre, from which wound the blood gushed forth. Reel ing and fainting, she was held under the arms by two monsters who made her walk over the dead bodies which filled the narrow passage which leads from the street St. Antoine to the prison. When she could no longer raise herself up, the assassins threw her upon a heap of corpses, and stabbed her to death with their pikes. Her"], [508, "434 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. head was cut off by these hellish fiends, her body was opened, and her heart torn out, and her body was hacked into a dozen pieces, and borne about the streets of Paris with wild yells and coarse jests. The demons even loaded a cannon with one of her limbs ; and placing her head upon a pike, the mob bore it to the Temple, where the royal family were imprisoned. The frenzied mon sters, parading beneath the windows of the apartment where the king and queen were sitting, demanded with threats of the king's jailers that they should be allowed to show this ghastly relic to the royal inmates. Finding resistance was vain, the mob were permitted to enter the court upon which the windows of the apartments of the king and queen looked out. One of the guards within, hearing the tumult and perceiving through the window this ghastly sight, endeavored to prevent the king's approach. But another, with brutal cruelty, directed the attention of Louis to the awful spectacle. The king was afterwards asked if he would recognize the soldier who had conducted himself so savagely. \" No,\" he replied ; \" but I should perfectly well remember him who evinced so much feeling.\" But notwithstanding the efforts of the kind-hearted guard to screen the king, the tumult was so great that the queen in terror asked the reason of this uproar. Whereupon the inhuman guard said to her, with cold-blooded impudence : \" They want to keep you from seeing De Lamballe's head, which has been brought you that you may know how the people avenge them selves upon their tyrants : I advise you to show yourself, if you would not have them come up here.\" At this atrocious threat the queen fainted, and Madame Elizabeth and her children ran to her assistance. Mean while the brutal wretch looked unfeelingly around, with brazen, malicious satisfaction. The king said to him with"], [509, "THE HEAD OF THE PRINCESS LAMBALLE BORNE ABOUT THE STREETS OF PARIS."], [510, ""], [511, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 435 dignified calmness : \" We are prepared for everything, sir; but you might have dispensed with relating this horrible disaster to the queen.\" During the September massacres Madame la Princesse de Tarente was confined in one of the prisons where these terrible scenes were enacted. Her courage proves what strength of mind a woman can sometimes evince when required by circumstances. Brought before her judges, they promised her life if she would accuse the queen. Instead of accusing her, she boldly pleaded her cause. Strange to say, the intrepid princess was acquitted, but was soon seized again. Whereupon she demanded, with dauntless courage, that they should give her death or perfect liberty. Her judges were so amazed at her proud defiance, that her very assassins were con founded, and they allowed her to go free. In the same prison was Mademoiselle de Sombreuil, who voluntarily demanded arrest that she might be near her aged father, who had been taken to that place as a suspected aristocrat. At length the fatal moment arrived when her father was condemned to be murdered. As the old white-headed man was being led to execution, his daughter sprang to his side, threw herself into his arms, and screening the body of her father with her own form she demanded that the blows of the assassins should first be aimed at her. The brutal monsters were for a moment moved by this appealing spectacle ; but at length one of the murderers, with diabolical cruelty pre sented a glass of blood to Mademoiselle de Sombreuil, saying, \" You must drink the blood of an aristocrat, if you would save your father's life.\" For a moment the heroic girl shuddered at the sight of this revolting potion, but closing her eyes, and saying, with sublime self-sacrifice, \" As the price of my father's life, I drink"], [512, "436 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. it,\" she swallowed the disgusting fluid, and obtained her father's freedom. In imitation of this noble girl, Mademoiselle Cazotte, whose father was also confined in the same prison, deter mined to give her life for his. As the old man was sur rounded by the barbarous assassins, his daughter threw herself before him, and exclaimed to the murderers, \" You shall not reach my father till you have pierced my heart ! \" A cry for pardon was heard in the crowd. It was taken up by other voices, and a way was opened for the father and daughter to pass beyond the bloody sabres. But this effort of Mademoiselle to save her father did not avail in the end. Again they were im prisoned, and while she was separated from him, her father was led to execution. The instigators of these hellish deeds defended them selves, and declared that necessity required these awful measures. Danton did not hesitate to avow his approval, saying, \" I looked my crime steadfastly in the face and I did it.\" Robespierre alone is reported to have evinced some horror at these lawless massacres. On the night of the 2d of September Robespierre and Saint-Just retired together from the Jacobin Club to the room of the latter. Saint-Just threw himself upon the bed to rest. \" What, can you think of sleeping on such a night ? \" exclaimed Robespierre. \"Do you not hear the tocsin? Do you not know that this night will be the last to perhaps thousands of our fellow-creatures, who are men at the moment you fall asleep, but when you awaken will be lifeless corpses ? \" \" I know it,\" replied Saint-Just, \" and deplore it ; and I wish that I could moderate the convulsions of society. But what am I ? \" And he turned over and was soon asleep."], [513, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 437 In the morning when Saint-Just awoke he beheld Robespierre excitedly walking the room with evident emotion. \" What, have you not slept ? \" asked Saint- Just. \" Sleep ! \" cried Robespierre. \" Sleep while hundreds of assassins murdered thousands of victims, and their blood runs like water down the streets ! Oh, no ! I have not slept. I have watched like remorse or crime. I have had the weakness not to close my eyes, but Danton, he has slept ! \" But all too soon did Robespierre conquer what he called weakness, what humanity would call praiseworthy strength. Before long he could slaughter hi-s thousands, and, like Danton, sleep. And what did the Commune say to this satanic work ? On the 3d of September Billaud Varennes thus addressed the assassins : \" Respectable citizens, you have just destroyed a set of scoundrels ; you have saved the country ; all France owes you eter- nal gratitude ; the municipality knows not how to make a return to you. Undoubtedly the booty and the spoils of these scoundrels [pointing to the dead bodies] belong to those who have delivered us from them ; but, not deeming this a sufficient reward, I am deputed to offer each of you twenty-four livres. Respectable citizens, continue your work, and the country will be grateful.\" After this famous speech, Billaud entered the committee of the section, and directed it to give the twenty-four livres each to the assassins ; and as he left the room, the wretches entered in a body and demanded their wages of blood. Never was there seen a more horrible spec- tacle than these monsters presented. \"One held a sabre; another, a blood-stained bayonet ; another, a broken pike covered with human brains ; another had torn out a pal pitating heart, which he carried at the end of a muti-"], [514, "438 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. lated halberd \" : these, with other bloody trophies too revolting to mention, were held aloft in fiendish glee, and pointed out with brutal jokes and savage jeers. \"Do you think that I have only gained twenty-four livres?\" exclaimed a journeyman baker armed with a club; \"I have killed more than forty of them for my share.\" And the women-furies of the mobs were not behind the men in bloodthirsty vengeance. Two women were met that morning, carrying some food to their husbands. \"Where are you going?\" asked a neighbor. \"We are carrying breakfast to our men, who are working at the Abbaye,\" was the reply. \"Is there still work?\" asked an assassin who had been sleeping in a drunken stupor, and had just roused himself to seek for more victims. \" If there is no more work,\" answered the unnatural women, \" it will be very necessary to make it.\" On the 3d of September, in the morning, Billaud Varennes entered the Council-General of the Commune, holding by the hand an assassin covered with blood from his late butcheries, and presented him as \" a brave man ivho had labored well.\" Such was the Commune's reception of its servants, who had carried out its nefa rious plots. But we cannot linger longer amidst these September horrors ; other scenes in the appalling Reign of Terror demand our attention. On the 20th of September the battle of Valmy was fought. On the 21st of September the Legislative Assembly, having passed 2140 decrees, retired from its wearisome and thankless labors, and the Convention was opened. This same Convention shall yet make a terrible and bloody record, restrained and overawed by the sovereign of France, the infamous and terrible Commune. Royalty is now officially abolished"], [515, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 439 by the Convention ; and the Republic is declared. Dan ton, Marat, and Robespierre, the terrific Triumvirate, shall for a little hold their bloody rule ! Ill-fated Louis, if thou hadst not been so fond of lock-making, or had chosen more prudently thy in structor in thy favorite pastime ! For now behold thy secret iron chest is discovered through the treachery of that same brawny tutor, and thou art surely now undone ! What was in this iron chest ? Oh, careless Louis ! When the queen begged of thee to gather thy secret papers to be entrusted to faithful Madame Cam pan, in the precious portfolio which she so carefully guarded and so steadfastly concealed, why didst thou leave those fatal letters in the iron chest, thinking the secret spring was guard sufficient ? Betrayed again by thy belief in human nature. What have you to an swer, Louis, to these proofs in thy own handwriting of complicity with the Allies which this iron chest has revealed ? Gamain, the locksmith, receives a pension of two hundred and forty dollars a year for his Judas work; but what wilt thou receive ? ominously now the gallows. Or, since Dr. Guillotin has so expedited and refined the trade of execution (most unwittingly, poor man !), thou wilt be treated to the red guillotine. \"Heads whisked off in a minute, Messieurs ! \" Very true ; heads whisked off : but royal heads or plebeian heads are of little value, unfortunately, to their owners, after they are whisked off, be it never so expertly done.

What with Judas locksmiths, condemnatory iron chests, and bloody Communes, and monster Marats, shrieking for"], [516, "440 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. more heads, and daring Dantons, who can sleep through September massacres, and rabid Robespierres, increasing daily in fits of frenzied madness, it is not strange to find that imprudent Louis is soon brought to trial. This new Convention must straightway make a con stitution, that of 1793 ; the old one, of 1791, being found too weak in republican principles for the advanced think ers of the defiant Commune. This victory of the patriots of Valmy has been cele brated with much enthusiasm in Paris. Notably in one illustrious salon, that of Madame Roland, just now the acknowledged queen of the Republic, if such paradoxical terms may be allowed. Never has Madame Roland shone with such supernatural brilliancy and beauty. Even stolid M. Roland is observed to gaze at her with almost peculiar fondness. Did he foresee the future? The most famous of the Girondists have met in her salon, and at the close of the entertainment the gifted Ver gniaud filled his glass and proposed to drink to the eter nity of the Republic. \"Permit me,\" said Madame Roland, rising, and courteously offering him a flower, \" after the manner of the ancients, to scatter some rose-leaves from my bouquet into your glass.\" Vergniaud held out his goblet, while the beautiful woman, with eyes flashing and face illumined with her ardent love of liberty, daintily scattered some fragrant petals upon the sparkling wine. In strangely prophetic words, Vergniaud then exclaimed, \" We should quaff not roses, but cypress leaves, in our wine to-night. In drink ing to a republic stained at its birth with the blood of September, who knows that we do not drink to our own death ? No matter ; were this wine my blood, I would drain it to liberty and equality.\" \"Vive la Republique I\" cried his enthusiastic friends ; and in a few months his prophetic vision was fulfilled."], [517, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 441 But let us enter the chamber of the condemned, and contemplate the picture of the last hours of Louis XVI., sketched by Carlyle. This portraiture, amongst the many pen-pictures wrought out by other historians, instantly fixes our gaze and rivets our attention, to the exclusion of all the rest. \" To this conclusion, then, hast thou come, 0 hapless Louis ! The Son of Sixty Kings is to die on the Scaffold by form of Law. Innocent Louis bears the sins of many generations ; he, too, experiences that man's tribunal is not in this earth ; that if he had no Higher one, it were not well with him. A Confessor has come ; Abbe Edge- worth, whom the King knew by good report, has come promptly on this solemn mission. Leave the earth alone, then, thou hapless King; it with its malice will go its way ; thou also canst go thine. A hard scene yet remains ; the parting with our loved ones. Kind hearts, environed in the same grim peril with us, to be left here ! Let the Reader look with the eyes of valet C16ry through these glass-doors, where also the Municipality watches ; and see the cruelest of scenes. 'At half-past eight the door of the ante-room opened. The Queen appeared first, leading her son by the hand ; then Madame Royale, and Madame Elizabeth; they all flung themselves into the arms of the King. Silence reigned for some minutes, interrupted only by sobs. The Queen made a movement to lead his Majesty towards the inner room, where M. Edgeworth was waiting unknown to them. \" No,\" said the King, \"let us go into the dining-room; it is there only that I can see you.\" They entered there ; I shut the door of it, which was of glass. The King sat down, the Queen on his left hand, Madame Royale almost in front ; the young prince remained standing between his Father's legs. They all leaned towards him, and often"], [518, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 442 held him embraced. This scene of woe lasted an hour and three quarters ; during which we could hear nothing ; we could see only that always when the King spoke, the sobbings of the Princesses redoubled, continued for some minutes ; and that then the King began again to speak.' \" For nearly two hours this agony lasts ; then they tear themselves asunder. ' Promise that you will see us on the morrow.' He promises : ' Ah yes, yes ; yet once ; and go now, ye loved ones ; cry to God for yourselves and me ! ' It was a hard scene, but it is over. He will not see them on the morrow. The Queen, in passing through the ante-room, glanced at the Cerberus Munici pals ; and, with woman's vehemence, said through her tears, ' Vous etes tous des scelerats.' \"King Louis slept sound, till five in the morning, when C16ry, as had been ordered, awoke him. C16ry dressed his hair. While this went forward, Louis took a ring from his watch, and kept trying it on his finger ; it was his wedding-ring, which he is now to return to the Queen as a mute farewell. At half-past six he took the Sacrament ; and continued in devotion, and conference with Abb6 Edgeworth. He will not see his family ; it were too hard to bear. \" At eight the Municipals enter ; the King gives them his Will, and messages and effects ; which they, at first, brutally refuse to take charge of. He gives them a roll of gold pieces, a hundred and twenty-five louis ; these are to be returned to Malesherbes, who had lent them. At nine, Santerre says the hour is come. The King begs to retire for three minutes, Santerre again says the hour is come. Stamping on the ground with his right foot, Louis answers, 'Partons' [let us go].

A Queen weeps bitterly ; a King's Sister and Children. Over all these four does Death also hover ; all shall perish miser ably save one; she, as Duchesse d' Angouleme, will live, \u2014 not happily. \"At the Temple Gate were some faint cries, perhaps from voices of pitiful women, ' Grace ! Grdce ! ' Through the rest of the streets there is silence as of the grave. No man not armed is allowed to be there; the armed, did any even pity, dare not express it, each man over awed by all his neighbors. All windows are down, none seen looking through them. All shops are shut. No wheel-carriage rolls, this morning, in these streets but one only. Eighty thousand armed men stand ranked, like armed statues of men ; cannons bristle, cannoneers with match burning, but no word or movement ; it is as a city enchanted into silence and stone. One carriage, with its escort, slowly rumbling, is the only sound. Louis reads, in his Book of Devotion, the Prayers of the Dying ; clatter of this death-march falls sharp on the ear, in the great silence ; but the thought would fain struggle heaven ward, and forget the earth. \"As the clock strikes ten, behold the Place de la Rev olution, once Place de Louis Quinze ; the Guillotine, mounted near the old Pedestal where once stood the Statue of that Louis !

' Take care of M. Edgeworth,' he straitly charges the Lieu tenant who is sitting with them ; then they two descend. \" The drums are beating. ' Taisez-vous ! ' [silence !] he cries, in a terrible voice [d'une voix terrible']. He mounts the scaffold, not without delay; he is in puce coat, breeches of gray, white stockings. He strips off the coat ; stands disclosed in a sleeve-waistcoat of white flannel. The Executioners approach to bind him. He spurns, resists ; Abbe Edgeworth has to remind him how the Saviour, in whom men trust, submitted to be bound. His hands are tied, his head bare ; the fatal moment is come. He advances to the edge of the scaffold, ' his face very red,' and says : ' Frenchmen, I die innocent ; it is from the scaffold and near appearing before God that I tell you so. I pardon my enemies ; I desire that France \u2014 .' A General on horseback, Santerre or another, prances out, with uplifted hand: 'Tambours!' The drums drown the voice. 'Executioners, do your duty!' The executioners, desperate lest themselves be murdered (for Santerre and his Armed Ranks will strike, if they do not), seize the hapless Louis : six of them desperate, him singly desperate, struggling there ; and bind him to their plank. Abbe Edgeworth, stooping, bespeaks him : ' Son of Saint Louis, ascend to Heaven.' The axe clanks down ; a King's Life is shorn away. It is Monday, the 21st of January, 1793.

The Jacobins had now gained a decisive ascendancy over the Girondists, whom they ac cused of being enemies of the people, and friends of royalty, because the Girondists endeavored to moderate the fury of the bloodthirsty anarchists, and had also wished to save the life of the king. Thus the Jacobins excited the hatred of the populace against the Girondists, whom they regarded as being hostile to the Republic. Danton was the acknowledged leader of the Jacobins. He had obtained control of the mob at Paris, and em ployed their wild outbursts of fury as the terrible weap ons of his enmity against his political opponents or per sonal enemies. Henri Martin says of Danton : \" The advocate Danton was a new Mirabeau, who had risen from the midst of the democracy. He resembled Mirabeau in his enormous head and shaggy hair, in his imposing ugliness, in his eloquence, bold, impetuous, and full of grand images. Subject to the same accusations as Mirabeau, but with out any proof ; much less vicious than Mirabeau, despite the reputation they gave him, misinterpreting to his disadvantage the crudity of his language ; more violent than Mirabeau, he could allow himself to be led on to terrible acts which Mirabeau would never have com mitted ; but like Mirabeau, he was also capable of the most generous transports.\" England had entered into a treaty of alliance with Russia, Prussia, Austria, Naples, Spain, and Portugal, against France. She had also promised large subsidies to Hesse Cassel, Sardinia, and Baden.

These combined armies were to attack France by land, while the powerful English fleet was to storm her maritime towns. \" The Royalists in La Vendee rose in arms against the Republic, and unfurled the white banner of the Bourbons. France was now threatened more fearfully than ever before with external and internal war. The Convention, controlled by the Jacobins and appalled by the danger, decreed a levy of three hundred thousand men to repel the assailants, and also organized an extraordinary revo lutionary tribunal, invested with unlimited powers to arrest, judge, and punish any whom they should deem dangerous to the Republic. \" Violence filled the land, terror reigned everywhere, and even Robespierre was heard to exclaim, ' I am sick of the Revolution ! ' Dumouriez had driven the Austrians out of Belgium and the Netherlands, and was at the head of an army of about seventy-five thousand men. Disgusted with the anarchy which reigned in France, he formed the bold design of marching upon Paris with his army, dispersing the Convention, abolishing the Republic, reinstating a constitutional monarchy by establishing the Constitution of 1791, and by placing a king, probably the son of the Duke of Orleans, subsequently Louis Philippe, upon the throne. The Jacobins, goaded by these accumulating dangers, \u2014 all Europe assailing France from without, and Royalists plotting within, \u2014 were pre pared for any measures of desperation. \"Dumouriez sullied his character by surrendering to the Austrians several fortresses, and agreeing with them that he would march upon Paris and restore a monarchi cal government to France. The Austrians trusted that he would place upon the throne the young son of Louis"], [526, "448 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. XVI., though it was doubtless his intention to place there the young Duke of Chartres (Louis Philippe), who would be the representative of popular ideas. The Jac obin Club sent a deputation of three of its members to the camp, to sound the views of Dumouriez. The gen eral received them with courtesy, but said, with military frankness: 'The Convention is an assembly of tyrants. While I have three inches of steel by my side, that mon ster shall not exist. As for the Republic, it is an idle word. I had faith in it for three days. There is only one way to save the country ; that is to re-establish the Constitution of 1791, and a king.' \" ' Can you think of it ? ' one of the deputation ex claimed ; ' the French view royalty with horror. The very name of Louis is an abomination.' \" ' 'What does it signify,' replied Dumouriez, ' whether the king be called Louis, or Jacques, or Philippe ? ' \" ' And what are your means to effect this revolution ? ' they inquired. \" ' My army,' Dumouriez proudly replied. ' From my camp or from the stronghold of some fortress they will express their resolve for a king.' \" ' But your plan will peril the lives of the rest of the royal family in the Temple.' \" ' If every member of that family in France or at Coblentz should perish,' Dumouriez answered, ' I can still find a chief. And if any farther barbarities are practised upon the Bourbons in the Temple, I will surround Paris with my army and starve the Parisians into subjection.' \"The deputation returned to Paris with their report, and four commissioners were immediately despatched, accompanied by the Minister of War, to summon Dumou riez to the bar of the Convention. Dumouriez promptly arrested the commissioners, and sent them off to the Austrians, to be retained by them as hostages."], [527, "THE INSATIABLE GUILLOTINE. 449 \" The Convention immediately offered a reward for the head of Dumouriez, raised an army of forty thousand men to defend Paris, and arrested all the relatives of the officers under Dumouriez as hostages. Dumouriez now found that he had not a moment to lose. Perils were accumulating thick around him. There were many in dications that it might be difficult to carry the army over to his view. On the 4th of April, as he was repair ing to a place of rendezvous with the Austrian leaders, the Prince of Coburg, and General Mack, a battalion of sol diers, suspecting treachery, endeavored to stop him. He put spurs to his horse, and distanced pursuit, while a storm of bullets whistled around his head. He suc ceeded, after innumerable perils, in the circuitous ride of a whole day, in reaching the headquarters of the Aus trians. They received him with great distinction, and offered him the command of a division of their army. After two days' reflection, he said that it was with the soldiers of France he had hoped to restore a stable gov ernment to his country, accepting the Austrians only as auxiliaries ; but that as a Frenchman, he could not march against France at the head of foreigners. He retired to Switzerland.

Le Grand Manoir was the name of this ruin. A fountain, moss-covered, occupied one corner of the courtyard, from which a low door opened upon a winding staircase which led to the upper story, the two lead-framed windows of which, filled with small octagon panes of glass, looked out upon the court below. Seated at one of these windows, or, more often, half reclining in the sunshine at the brink of the fountain, appeared a young and beautiful girl. Always with book in hand, she pored over its pages with absorbed attention. Her neatly fitting dress of dark cloth was fashioned somewhat in the shape of a riding habit ; and if one beheld her at the fountain, or in the"], [529, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 451 streets, rather than framed like a picture in the vine encircled window, she wore a gray felt hat, turned up at the sides, and tied with black ribbon, after the style of ladies of rank. For though this young girl seemed at times a peasant, by her humble occupations, she was in truth a descendant of nobility, and was the grand daughter of the great French dramatist, Pierre Corneille, by her mother's side, and her father belonged to the poor nobility of France. Such was Charlotte Corday in 1793. At this time she was living with an aged aunt, in the quaint house we have just described. Charlotte was tall and slender. Her face was softened by a shade of seriousness, which illumined rather than overshadowed her fine features. The deep feelings of her soul seemed so impressed upon her countenance that an observer's admiration was un consciously mingled with a respectful veneration, as though some ill-defined presentiment of her tragic destiny was already stamped upon her noble brow. Her motions displayed grace and dignity, combining the rhythmic gliding of poetry with the stately stride of tragedy ; for poetry and heroism were in her united, in form and fea ture, in mind and spirit ; and, as love or hate must ever be woman's ruling force to lead them to action, in her this love was embodied in patriotism, and her only hate was detestation of tyranny. There she sat in the sunshine, this imposing girl, graceful in every motion, and so mournful in her gaze, as her large eyes, now dark as night's shadows, then blue as the tint of summer skies, were lifted upward, with a look which seemed to hold some impending woe in their soft depths. Her hair was almost black at times, when the light did not fall upon it ; but the sun shine brought a golden shimmer to the long tresses which"], [530, "452 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. were coiled about her proudly balanced head, the poise of which gave hauteur to her bearing, until you caught the kind, sympathizing glance of her melting eyes, or when her long brown-black lashes swept her richly tinted cheek, and lay there like a veil of modesty concealing the too glorious brightness of her eyes. Her mouth was Grecian ; the lips well-cut, with an expression fluctuating between tenderness and severity, in harmony with the hauteur of her head and the pathos of her eyes. Her nose, united to her brow by an almost imperceptible curve, was slightly arched in the centre, \u2014 mark, always, of a nature which would uphold the right, or defend the weak ; aggressive, though not for self, but in defence of the suffering against oppression. Like La Fayette, she possessed an instinctive love of liberty. The lower part of her face was characterized by almost mascu line resolution, denoted by a somewhat projecting chin, divided by a deep dimple. Her spirit would not quake before whatever deed her tender, far-seeing eyes might behold before her ; and her heroic brow and oval cheek would never be crossed by a selfish or a petty line, should her destiny spare her life to maturity. Her hands were long, with fingers tapering; such hands as could smooth the sufferer's pillow with velvet touch, or nerve themselves to most repellent deeds. But in her voice lay her chief charm. That voice, once heard, would vibrate forever on the listener's ear. Such was Charlotte Corday d'Armont. She was left motherless in infancy, and she had in some sort reared herself. She had lived in thought with the heroes of her grand father's tragedies, and her mind was impassioned with the ideas revealed in the writings of her ancestor, Cor neille, and with the thoughts of Plutarch and Rousseau."], [531, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 453 But though she was also a pupil of Rousseau, she was not, like Madame Roland, a child of her own century, but rather seemed to be a daughter of Athens and Rome. Though affectionate in her friendships, her heart was not swayed by personal feelings, and she had attained her twenty-fifth year without giving way to passionate love. Private affections counted little with her beside the sufferings of her beloved country. She felt that she belonged first of all to France, and she determined to devote herself to the Republic. At this time eighteen of the Girondists banished from the Convention had taken refuge in Caen. The Jac obins, desiring to wrest the Republic from the Gironde, in order to precipitate France into a bloody anarchy, had declared several of the Girondists traitors to their coun try because they had endeavored to stay the cruel faction of the Jacobins from their proposed work of bloodshed. The Girondists, \u2014 Buzot, Salles, P6tion, Valady, Gorsas, Barbaroux, Louvet, Duchdtel, and others, \u2014 had been for some time assembled in Caen, recruiting battalions of volunteers, and combining with the Republicans rising in Brittany. Charlotte Corday attended the meetings of the Girondists, listened with tearful eyes to their impas sioned addresses, and gazed with enthusiasm upon the departing volunteers, one of whom, young Franquelin, adored in silence this young girl-republican, and, to win her glance of approbation, had enrolled himself in the battalion of Caen. Charlotte, thinking only of her coun try, had no thought nor time for human love. But her indifference did not cool the devotion of Franquelin ; and after her execution, death-stricken by sorrow, he retired to his mother's home to die, begging her to bury in his grave with him the portrait and letters of Charlotte Corday, which he had received in past days."], [532, "454 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. News came that the monster Marat had already written the lists of proscription, and gleefully counted the num ber of heads which would suffice his diabolical vengeance. Two thousand five hundred victims were marked out in Lyons, three thousand in Marseilles, twenty -eight thou sand at Paris, and three hundred thousand in Brittany and Calvados. The stories which had reached Charlotte from Paris had represented Marat as the personification of all the violence and terrible crimes of the Revolution. In the mind of Charlotte he appeared as the one great tyrant, whose death would relieve France from all the awful horrors of the oncoming Reign of Terror. To kill this cruel monster appeared in the eyes of Charlotte a virtue worthy of the ancients whom she had made her model. He seemed to her as some loathsome dragon whom it was an heroic deed to destroy. She decided that, as no man offered to rid her country of this tyrant, she, a woman, would. Before leaving Caen, Charlotte presented herself several times at the Hotel of Intendance, where the citizens could meet the Girondist deputies. She saw and conversed with Buzot, Petion, Louvet, and Barba roux. Potion, mistaking her enthusiasm, said to her, \" Behold the beautiful aristocrat, who comes to see the Republicans ! \" \"Citizen Petion,\" replied Charlotte, with a blush of vexed and wounded pride, \"you judge me to-day without knowing me ; one day you will know who I am.\" All alone, with no one to counsel her, this young girl determined in her own mind to sacrifice her life for the liberty of France, as she thought. She imparted her purpose to no one. She requested from Barbaroux a letter of introduction to one of his colleagues in the Convention, by means of whom she could obtain a meet-"], [533, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 455 ing with the Minister of the Interior, under pretext that she desired to present to the government the claims of an old schoolmate, Mademoiselle de Forbin, who, belong ing to a noble family, had emigrated, and was suffering in poverty in Switzerland. Barbaroux gave her a letter to Duperret, one of the seventy-three deputies of the Girondist party who were overlooked in the first pro scription. This letter afterwards led Duperret to the scaffold, though there was not one word in it which could impute treason to the deputy who received it. Furnished with this letter, and a passport which she had previously provided herself with, Charlotte prepared for her departure. The gravity of her countenance awakened questions among her relatives, to whose inquiries she replied : \" I weep over the misfortunes of my country, over those of my relations. Whilst Marat lives, no one can be sure of a day's existence.\" Her aunt remembered afterwards, that when she entered Charlotte's chamber, to awaken her, she found upon her bed an old Bible, open at the apocryphal Book of Judith, with this verse marked, \" Judith went forth from the city, adorned with a marvellous beauty, which the Lord had bestowed on her, to deliver Israel.\" Seeing some citizens at their open door, playing cards, Charlotte exclaimed to them, \" You play, and the country is dying ! \" Bidding her father and sister and aunt fare well, she told them that she was going to seek refuge in England. They parted from her with tears, little imag ining the dreadful plan she was so steadfastly carrying out. She left many little mementos for her friends, in the shape of trifling gifts, and distributed her books among her young acquaintances, retaining only her vol ume of Plutarch. She obtained her father's benediction without revealing to him her purpose, and started for"], [534, "456 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Paris. She was winning and cheerful, though modest and retiring, amongst the travellers who journeyed in the same carriage with her to Paris ; and she won the heart, not only of a little girl with whom she gently played, but a young man in the company fell so deeply in love with her as to offer his hand in marriage upon the spot. Charlotte had carefully avoided answering any questions regarding her name or life, and replied to the earnest solicitations of this young man to learn something of her history, that at a later period he would know her name. Arriving in Paris, July 11, 1793, she was taken to the ' Hdtel de la Providence. She retired to rest at five in the evening, and slept profoundly until the next day. Alone in that great city, with such a terrible mission to perform, what must have been her thoughts and feelings ? Dressed in a simple manner, she went to the house of Duperret. He was absent at the Convention. His daughters re- ceived for him the letter Charlotte had brought, and requested her to call again at six that evening. At that hour Charlotte presented herself and met Duperret. After mentioning her business connected with the letter, she felt impelled to say warningly, \u2014 \" Citizen Duperret, leave the Convention : you can do no more good there. Go to Caen, and rejoin your col leagues and brothers.\" \" My post is at Paris,\" replied the deputy ; \" I will not leave it.\" \" You are in error,\" replied Charlotte, in an appealing manner. \" Believe me,\" she added, in a hurried and earn est tone. \" Fly, fly before to-morrow night ! \" And with this warning she departed. That very night the Conven tion ordered seals to be placed on the houses of suspected deputies, and Duperret was of the number. Notwith-"], [535, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 457 standing, he went in the morning, as he had promised, to conduct Charlotte to the presence of the minister Garat. But an audience could not be granted them before that night. As the meeting with the minister was not of great importance in Charlotte's plan, she turned her attention to her chief mission. Leaving Duperret, she proceeded to the Palais Royal, where she purchased a sharp knife, and concealed it under her handkerchief. Her first in tention had been to stab Marat at the Champ de Mars during the fete of July 14, or in the Convention. She wrote to Marat, asking an interview, stating that she wished to tell him of the plots that were meditated at Caen against him. About seven o'clock that evening, Charlotte left the hotel, attired in white, with a long silken scarf folded over her shoulders, and upon her head a white Normandy cap trimmed with lace. A wide green ribbon was fastened to her cap and wound round her head, and from the cap behind her hair fell loose below her waist. She had dressed with unusual care, that her appearance might attract the persons about Marat, and so she might, by making a pleasing impression, gain more speedy access. Marat dwelt on the first floor of a dilapidated house in the Rue de Cordeliers. His apartments were meanly furnished. His numerous publications were scattered about the room, and the newspapers of the day lay on chairs and tables ; while printers' boys were coming and going, and women were employed in folding and directing pamphlets, and a perpetual crowd of people surrounded the house of this mad journalist and bloodthirsty leader of anarchy. A lingering disease had for some time been consuming him ; but he wrote continually, now in bed, now in the bath, ever clutching his bitter pen to hurl"], [536, "458 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. curses against those who had incurred his hatred, and with sardonic smile making out his lists of blood. More anxious to kill than to live, he only feared that death would not leave him time to destroy enough victims. Fearing assassination, access to his house was forbidden unless they were assured friends, or came strongly recom mended. His poverty-stricken home was guarded like the palace of a tyrant by the miserable woman who was his household slave, though he called her wife, and a band of evil associates who watched Marat's safety as necessary to their own. Charlotte alighted from her hackney coach, on the opposite side of the street, in front of Marat's residence. The portress at first refused to admit her to Marat's apartments ; but Charlotte ascended part way up the stairs, when she was confronted by the woman who, strangely enough, was willing to bear the discomforts of this revolting place, and, stranger still, manifested the warmest love for the filthy and coarse being whom she called her husband. Marat was at this time in his bath, which was in a small room, where, with a ragged cloth spread over the bathing-tub, leaving only his shoulders and head and arms above the water, he sat busily writing on a plank laid across the bath, holding his paper and ink. Hearing the altercation in the hall, and imagining the unknown stran ger might be the person whose note he had received, he called to his wife and commanded that she admit the person who asked to see him. Grumblingly the woman obeyed, and Charlotte was ushered into this disagreeable apartment. Marat held in his right hand the fatal pen with which he had signed so many lives away. His matted hair was wrapped in a tattered handkerchief and his protruding eyes and sneering mouth and shriv-"], [537, "DEATH OF MARAT"], [538, ""], [539, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 459 elled arms and livid skin made him a loathsome sight. Charlotte took care not to look him in the face, lest her horror at his revolting appearance might be betrayed upon her countenance. With downcast eyes she stood beside him for an instant. As Charlotte stands there awaiting Marat's inquiries concerning her letter, she nerves herself to perform her repellent deed. He asks her for the names of the depu ties hiding at Caen. She gives them to him, and as he writes them down he exclaims, with a Mephistophelian leer, \"Well, before they are a week older, they shall have the guillotine ! \" That sentence was his death signal. Charlotte drew the knife from the folds of her dress, and with superhuman strength plunged it into his heart. As she drew the bloody weapon from his side and dropped it on the floor, Marat cried, \" Help, help ! \" and expired. His wife and others rushed into the room and raised the sinking head of Marat. The water of the bath was dyed with red, and thus he seemed to have perished in a bath of blood. Fit death-bed for this murderous, blood- thirsty monster. Having laid the corpse of Marat on the bed, the people turned to Charlotte. She had not tried to escape, but was standing motionless behind the window curtain. Her deed was done, and the horror of it now seemed to petrify her. A man grasped a chair and struck her to the ground, and the frenzied wife of Marat tram- pled upon her, and the crowds filling the room would have torn her to pieces, had not some soldiers surrounded her and kept her from the fury of the mob, who would have most brutally attacked her. Her arms wrere crossed and tied, and a file of bayonets kept back the riotous crowds. Except the feeling of pity for the poor woman who had really seemed to love the revolting Marat, Charlotte displayed no emotion. As the people cursed"], [540, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 460 her for the loss of their idol, a bitter smile of contempt rested for a moment on her countenance. \" Poor people, she said, \" you desire my death, whilst you owe me an altar for having freed, you from a monster. Cast me to that infuriate mob ! \" she exclaimed to the soldiers ; \" as they regret him, they are worthy to be my executioners ! \" To the questions of the police officers, regarding the motive for this surprising action, she replied : \" I wished to put a stop to the civil war, and to offer up my life for the good of my country. I have no accomplices.\" Charlotte was conveyed to the Abbaye, the nearest prison. Chabot, Drouet, and Legendre followed her there, where she underwent a second examination. Le gendre, proud of his Revolutionary importance, desired to be thought to be also worthy of being a martyr, and feigned to recognize in Charlotte a young girl who had come to his house the previous evening in the dress of a nun, and whom he had sent away. \" Citizen Legendre is mistaken,\" said Charlotte, with a smile of scorn ; \" I never saw him before. I do not esteem the life or death of such a man important to the safety of the Republic.\" Upon being searched, in her pockets were found only the key to her trunk, her thimble, some implements of needle-work, two hundred francs, and a gold watch. Be neath her neckerchief was still concealed the sheath of the knife with which she killed Marat. \" Do you recognize this knife ? \" she was asked. \"Yes.\" \" What led you to this crime ? \" \" I saw civil war ready to rend France to atoms ; per suaded that Marat was the principal cause of the perils and calamities of the land, I have sacrificed my life for his, to save my country.\""], [541, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 461 \" Mention the persons who urged you to this detestable crime, which you coidd not have conceived of yourself.\" \" No one knew my intention.\" \" Did you not leave Caen with the resolution of assas sinating Marat ? \" \" That was my sole motive.\" \" Did you not attempt to escape after the murder ? \" \" I should have gone out at the door if I had not been prevented.\" \" Are you a single woman ? \" \"I am.\" \" Have you never had a lover ? \" \"Never.\" At the end of this examination, Chabot, disappointed that he could not intimidate her, perceived a paper pinned to the waist of her dress. He grasped it roughly, and she, springing back in horror, broke the string which fastened her dress, and blushing at her disordered gar ments, she piteously begged to have the cords removed from her hands until she should have properly arranged her gown. These men were, fortunately, not brutal enough to refuse her request, forced upon her by her shrinking modesty; and so touching was her appeal that some even turned aside to conceal their tears. While her hands were free she was made to sign her replies. The paper pinned upon her breast was an address to Frenchmen, and read thus : \u2014 \"Address to Frenchmen, friends of the law and peace. \"How long, 0 unhappy Frenchmen ! will you delight in trouble and division ? Too long have the factious and villains substituted the interests of their ambition in the place of the general interest. Why, victims of their fury, should you destroy yourselves to establish the tyranny"], [542, "462 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. they desire on the ruins of France ? Factions break out on every side; the Mountain triumphs by crime and oppression ; a few monsters, bathed in our blood, lead these detestable plots. We are laboring at our own destruction with more zeal and energy than we ever employed in the conquest of liberty. 0 Frenchmen ! but a brief space, and nothing will remain but the recol lection of your existence. \"Already the departments are indignantly inarching on Paris. Already the fire of discord and civil war con sumes the half of this empire ; there is but one means of extinguishing it, but it must be promptly employed. Already that vilest of wretches, Marat, whose very name presents the image of every crime, by falling under an avenging steel, shakes the Mountain, and alarms Danton and Robespierre, and the other brigands, seated on this bloody throne, surrounded by the thunders which the avenging gods doubtless only suspend in order to render their fall more terrible, and to deter all those who would seek to build their fortunes on the ruins of a deceived people. \" Frenchmen, you know your enemies. Rise ! March ! Let the destruction of the Mountain leave nothing but brothers and friends. 0 France ! thy repose depends upon the execution of the laws. I do not infringe them by killing Marat. Condemned by the universe, he is beyond the pale of the law. What tribunal will condemn me ? If I am guilty, so was Alcides when he destroyed the monsters. \" 0 my country ! thy misfortunes rend my heart. I can only offer thee my life ; and I thank Heaven that I am at liberty to dispose of it. No one will be a loser by my death.

I desire"], [543, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 463 that my last sigh may be useful to my fellow-citizens : that my head, borne through Paris, may serve as a rally ing-point for all the friends of the laws ; that the totter ing Mountain should behold its destruction, written in my blood ; that I may be their last victim, and that the universe may declare that I have merited well at the hands of humanity. And I declare that, if my conduct were viewed in another light, I should care but little. \"My father and friends should not be molested. No one was acquainted with my plans. I join my baptismal register to this address, to show of what the weakest hand is capable, when aided by the most entire devotion. If I do not succeed in my enterprise, Frenchmen, I have shown you the way. You know your enemies. Arise ! march ! Strike them ! \" Then she quoted these lines, which Voltaire in his tragedy, \" The Death of C\u00e6sar,\" puts in the mouth of Brutus : \" Whether this great action be to the surprised universe an object of horror or of admiration, my mind, having little desire to live in the world's memory, cares neither for reproach nor glory. Always independent, and always a citizen, I only seek to do my duty ; all else is nothing to me. Come, dream no longer of aught save escaping from slavery ! \" Charlotte was soon taken to the Conciergerie. From thence she wrote several letters to her friends. In one she says : \" To-morrow, at eight, they are to pass sentence on me ; at noon i\" shall have lived, to speak after the Roman fashion. I am wholly ignorant as to how these last moments will be passed. It is the end which crowns the deed. Up to this instant I have not felt the slightest fear.\" She wrote also to her father as follows : \" Pardon me, my dear papa, for having disposed of my life without"], [544, "464 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. your permission. I have avenged many innocent victims, and prevented many disasters. The people will one day acknowledge the service I have rendered my country. Farewell, my beloved father ! Forget me ; or rather, rejoice at my fate. I die in a noble cause. Embrace for me my sister, whom I love with all my heart. Never forget the words of Corneille : ' It is the crime that makes the disgrace, and not the scaffold.' \" On July 17th Charlotte Corday appeared before the Revolutionary tribunal. The president appointed as her counsel a young lawyer named Chauveau-Lagarde. \" When she appeared in the auditorium,\" wrote her defender at a later day, \"all \u2014 judges, jurors, and spec tators \u2014 seemed to look upon her as a judge who had summoned them before the tribunal of God. Her fea tures may be painted, and her words repeated, but no art can portray the noble soul that breathed through her whole countenance.\" Her examination recalls the dialogues of Corneille's heroes, which seem an exchange of thunderbolts. \" What induced you to assassinate Marat ?\" \"His crimes.\" \" What did you hope to gain by killing him ? \" \" To restore peace to my country.\" \" But do you think that you have killed all the Marats ? \" \" No ; but, he being dead, the others may be struck with terror.\" After the witnesses had been examined, the president asked her, \" What have you to say in reply to all this ? \" \" Nothing, except that I have succeeded.\" \" Since when had you formed this design ? \" \"Since the 31st of May, when the deputies of the people were arrested.

I was a Republican long before the Revolution.\" Fauchet, who had been accused of being her accom plice, was confronted with her. \" I only know Fauchet by sight. I look on him as a man devoid of principles, and I despise him.\" Fauchet, angered by this reply, then accused her of having practised how to kill, as she had dealt the fatal stroke downwards, thereby making it more certain. At this base suggestion, which assimilated her with professed murderers, she uttered a cry of horror. Satis fied with the honesty of her own motives, she had sup posed that all men would have judged her motive before her deed ; and now, for the first time awakened from her ideal heroism to a sense of the light in which her act would be viewed, she exclaimed with a shuddering agony, mingled with defiant contempt, \" Oh, the monster ! he takes me for an assassin.\" This cry of anguish wrung from the heart of this self sacrificing girl is the best argument in her favor. Not to vindicate her action by any means, not to exonerate her hand from the crime of murder, but to exonerate her heart from complicity in her bloody deed. Montane, the president, wished to save her if possible. When he asked the jurors the usual question, \"Has she acted with premeditation and criminal intent ? \" he omitted the last words. This clemency caused his in dictment three days afterwards. It was suggested to her counsel that he might plead her insanity. But one glance of that clear and unflinching eye, and her calm dignity of manner, proved to him that she would never consent to be saved in this manner. \" This composure and abnegation, so sublime in some respects,\" said he, \"can only be accounted for by the most exalted political fanaticism.\""], [546, "466 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Charlotte Corday heard her death-sentence without a tremor, and courteously thanked Chauveau-Lagarde for having nobly defended her, gently refused a priest who offered his ministrations, and gave her last moments to a painter, Hauer, that he might finish her portrait which he had begun during her examination. This portrait is now in the Museum at Versailles, and is thus described: \" Hauer has preserved to posterity the faithful image of that marvellous beauty which is the perfection of the Norman type, softened and idealized. Her oval face, with imposing yet delicate features, is framed in a wealth of magnificent gold-brown tresses. Her large eyes, with their long lashes, are slightly veiled by a sadness arising less, perhaps, from the knowledge that she was about to die than from that of having herself inflicted death.\" While the artist was sketching her portrait, the exe cutioner entered her cell, bearing the scissors and red chemise, seeing which, Charlotte turned pale for a moment ; and then, recovering her composure, she said to the artist, \" Monsieur, I know not how to thank you for the trouble you have taken ; I have only this to offer you. Keep it, in memory of your kindness and my grati tude.\" As she spoke, she took the scissors from the executioner, and severing a long lock of her shining hair, she handed it to M. Hauer. The executioner then cut off her hair, bound her hands, and put on her the chemise des condamnh. To this Char lotte submitted patiently, saying only, \" This is the toi lette of death, arranged by somewhat rude hands, but it leads to immortality.\" It was on the evening of July 17th that Charlotte Corday was taken from her prison to the scaffold. As she mounted the fatal cart, a terrible storm was raging and amid the fury of the elements the red-clothed assas-"], [547, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY TAKEN TO THE SCAFFOLD."], [548, ""], [549, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 467 sins appeared like demons, as they held their flaming torches aloft, and joined with the women, who were fitly called \" furies of the guillotine,\" in loud yells and brutal imprecations. The form of the beautiful girl seemed like some angel of light amongst that fiendish rabble. One writes of her, \" Immortality beamed from her eyes.\" And as her calm glance fell with pitying commiseration upon the frenzied populace, the cries of coarse insult ceased ; and the mob, whom her enemies had tried to excite against her, were awed by her heroic beauty into silence, and even scarcely restrained their signs of admir ing respect for her dauntless courage. As Charlotte approached the instrument of death, her cheek paled slightly for one moment ; but quickly the flush mounted again, and she ascended the steps of the scaffold without assistance, and with a countenance beam ing with an exalted look she saluted the people, but was not allowed to speak. The storm of rain was over, and as she stood there for an instant, the rays of the setting sun fell upon her head, and her complexion, heightened by her red garment, was of an unearthly brilliancy. All gazed with wonder upon her, for she seemed trans figured into some vision of celestial vengeance. Of her own accord she arranged herself for the fatal knife, which, falling, severed that fair head from the beautiful form, and the ghastly deed was done. Whether we praise or condemn the murder of Marat, we must bow in wondering amaze before the heroic courage of this dauntless girl ; and if any murder of the long list made by the terrible French Revolution \u2014 either by so-called law on the scaffold, or by the knife of the Republican fanatic, called assassination \u2014 could have been said to have been just, surely the death of the brutal tyrant Marat must be numbered among the just retributions"], [550, "468 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. for crimes which only monsters could originate and carry out. \"All who witnessed the last moments of Charlotte Corday retained an ineffaceable impression of them. Andrd Chenier, the great poet, who was soon to perish, in his turn, upon the Revolutionary scaffold, celebrated Charlotte and her deed in verses worthy of Corneille. There was another who did still more ; he longed to die for her, and to follow her into the next world. This was a young Mayencais named Adam Lux, one of those dep uties from the Rhenish Convention who had come to demand the annexation of the left bank of the Rhine to France. He published a pamphlet in which he asked Charlotte's executioners to honor him with their guillo tine, in his eyes more glorious than an altar. He de manded that France should raise a statue to Charlotte, with the inscription, ' Greater than Brutus.' His request was granted ; he died like her and for her.\" Lamartine says of the deed and death of Charlotte Corday : \" In the face of murder history dares not praise, and in the face of heroism dares not condemn her. The appreciation of such an act places us in the terrible alter- native of blaming virtue or applauding assassination. Like the painter who, despairing of rendering the ex- pression of a mingled sentiment, cast a veil over the face of the figure, we must leave this mystery to be debated in the abysses of the human heart. There are deeds of which men are no judges, and which mount, without appeal, direct to the tribunal of God. There are human actions so strange a mixture of weakness and strength, pure intent and culpable means, error and truth murder and martyrdom, that we know not whether to term them crime or virtue. The culpable devotion of Charlotte Cor day is amongst those acts which admiration and horror"], [551, "CHARLOTTE CORDAY AND MARAT. 469 would leave eternally in doubt, did not morality reprove them. Had we to find for this sublime liberator of her country, and generous murderess of a tyrant, a name which should at once convey the enthusiasm of our feel ings towards her, and the severity of our judgment on her action, we would coin a phrase combining the extreme of admiration and horror, and term her the Angel of Assassination.\" \" Whose is this tomb ? \" sings the German poet Klop stock. \" It is the tomb of Charlotte. Let us gather flowers and scatter them over her ashes, for she is dead for her country. No, no, gather nothing ; let us seek a weeping willow, and plant it o'er her tomb, for she is dead for her country. No, no, plant nothing ; but weep, and let your tears be blood, for she is dead in vain for her country.\""], [552, "CHAPTER XII. August, 1793 to November, 1793.

Here Parliament, too, has held its sittings, and here the Grand Monarque, booted and spurred, thundering forth his arbitrary dicta has been answered by silence and submission. But this last royalty whom La Conciergerie receives within its portals is greeted by no royal welcome, is attended by no royal train, is clad in no habiliments of dignity \" divine \" ; and Austria's archduchess, queen-beau tiful of France, shorn of every vestige of that pomp and power which rendered her the cynosure of all eyes, now a dethroned and disconsolate widow, here for sixty days endures the refinements of human barbarity, and is finally released by a death, ignoble and ignominious, but by her courage and fortitude rendered sublime. Conciergerie of to-day, trim, neat, well kept, conveys no idea of Conciergerie of the Revolution. Then, dungeons damp and foul, floors covered with mud, and streams of water trickling down the stone walls were there ; a miserable pallet, coarse, covered with a dirty spread, a small pine table, and a chair, and these the only furniture. Into such apartments was ushered the former mistress of Versailles and Trianon, Fontainebleau and Marly-le- Roi. There poor Marie Antoinette must linger for sixty weary days. Youth, beauty, grandeur, friends, have fled; yet in Conciergerie's narrow dungeons her piety and resignation placed upon her brow a \" martyr's crown \" surpassing France's diamond diadem.

She did not affect a display of the rags which should have made the Republic blush. She did not dream of moving the regards of the people to pity. Her dignity as a woman and a queen forbade her to make any display of her misery. Her forehead, scathed by the Revolution, and faded by grief, was neither humbled nor cast down. Her eyes, surrounded by that black circle, which want of rest and tears had graved, like a bed of sorrow beneath the eyelids, still darted some rays of their former brilliancy upon the faces of her enemies. The beauty which had intoxicated the court and dazzled Europe was no longer discernible ; but its traces could be still distinguished. Her mouth sorrowfully preserved the folds of royal pride, but ill effaced by the lines of long suffering. The natural freshness of her northern complexion still struggled with the livid pallor of the prison. Her hair, whitened by anguish, contrasted with this youth of countenance and figure, and flowed down upon her neck as in bitter derision of the fate of youth and beauty. Her counte nance was natural, \u2014 not that of an irritated queen, in sulting in the depth of her contempt the people who triumphed over her, \u2014 nor that of a suppliant who inter cedes by her humility, and who seeks forbearance in compassion ; but that of a victim whom long misfortune had habituated to her lot, who had forgotten that she"], [555, "THE QUEEN OF FRANCE. 473 was a queen, who remembered only that she1 Was a woman, who claimed nothing of her vanished rank, who resigned nothing of the dignity of her sex and her deep dis tress.\" l And yet Marie Antoinette was unconsciously more superbly queenly in her humiliating misery than in the days of her most regal splendor. \" What is your name ? \" demanded Hermann of the accused. \" I am called Marie Antoinette of Lorraine in Austria,\" answered the queen, with proud dignity. \" Your condition ? \" \" Widow of Louis, formerly king of the French.\" \" Your age ? \" \" Thirty -eight.\" Fouquier-Tinville read the act of accusation to the tribunal. \" Her crime was being a queen, the consort and mother of a king, and the having abhorred a revolution which had deprived her of a crown, of her husband, her chil dren, and her life. To love the Revolution, she must have hated nature, and destroyed all human feeling. Between her and the Republic there was no legal form ; it was hatred even to death. The stronger of the two inflicted it on the other. It was not justice ; it was ven geance.

She in whose veins the royal blood of Hapsburg courses is not want ing to herself. In this hour of her greatest need, of her utter abandonment, Marie Antoinette appears far grander than when, in the heyday of her youth and beauty, sur rounded by all that can make life gorgeous, bright, and beautiful, she ruled a million hearts from her throne at Versailles, or played miller's wife at Trianon. Ah, courtly dames, flounced, laced and frilled, jewelled, painted and perfumed, ye duchesses, marquises and countesses with lofty plumes, look now upon your queen oppressed with woe, by all abandoned, \"with none so poor to do her reverence \" ; look, and reflect on man's stability !

She wrapped herself in that silence which was her last protection. Ferocious applause fol lowed her, even to the staircase which descends from the tribunal to the prison.

A slight recoil as she perceives this new humiliation, then proudly Marie Antoinette advances, composed and dignified, as when, in the old days of power and prosperity, she crossed the Cour de Marbre to take her coach for Tria non. And now the via dolorosa, the hideous shouts, \" Down with the Austrian ! \" \" Death to Messalina ! \" She heeds them not.

On the evening of the 28th they hastened to the Jacobin Club, and persuaded the society to agree to proceed in a body to the Convention the next day, to demand the sentence of the deputies within twenty-four hours. On the 29th, the Jacobins appeared at the bar of the Convention, and called for a decree giving the jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal the right to bring the proceedings to a close as soon as they be lieved themselves sufficiently enlightened. Robespierre and Barere supported the Jacobin demand. Upon Robes pierre's motion it was decreed that after three days' pro ceedings, the jurors might declare themselves ready to render their verdict. \" The next day the jurors availed themselves of their privilege, and declared themselves sufficiently informed, although they had not heard the evidence for acquittal, neither the accused nor their counsel having been allowed to plead their cause.

The priest offered to him the assistance of his ministry ; but Brissot, who had sacrificed his life on account of his devotion to the cause of the enslaved negroes, refused, gently saying, \" Do you know anything more holy than the death of an honest man, who dies for having refused the blood of his fellow-creatures to wretches ? \" Lasource, who had wit nessed the interview, then said to Brissot, \"Do you 1 Henri Martin."], [563, "THE QUEEN OF FRANCE. 481 believe in the immortality of your soul, and the Provi dence of God ? \" \" I do believe in them,\" answered Brissot ; \" and it is because I believe in them that I am about to die.\" \"At ten o'clock the executioners came to prepare them for the scaffold.

On the 6th of November he was taken before the dread tribunal. The Due d'Orleans had voted for the death of Louis XVI., and he was now accused by the tribunal of voting the death of Louis, with the hope that he himself might be his successor.

Was he a traitor or a patriot ? \"But probably no mortal ever had such things recorded of him ; such facts, and also such lies. For he was a Jacobin Prince of the Blood ! Consider what a combina tion!\" As the fatal cart was conveying the prince to the scaffold, it stopped for a moment on the Place du Palais Royal. \" Why do we stop here ? \" asked the duke, lift ing his head. \" That you may contemplate your palace,\" replied the priest beside him.

Hebert and his followers had long clam ored for her head. During her captivity she wrote her Memoirs, which, unfortunately, have not been preserved complete. \"Madame Roland at first wrote for pardon to Robes pierre, who had been her own and her husband's friend in 1791; whom she had often entertained at her own table, and whom she had vainly tried to reconcile to Brissot and the Girondists.\" -1 Upon reflection, however, Madame Roland decided not to appeal to Robespierre, and she destroyed her letter. A false rumor reached her that Buzot had been made a prisoner, and she thought of committing suicide; which would prevent the confiscation of her estate, which would revert to her child. She wrote her \" Last Thoughts,\" in which she gave her reasons for this premeditated act, and bade farewell to her husband and daughter, and added these lines, referring no doubt to Buzot : \" And you whom I dare not name ! . . . You whom the wildest passions did not lead to burst the barriers of virtue, will you grieve that I precede you to a land where we can love without crime, where nothing can prevent our union ? In leaving earth, we but approach each other.\" Madame Roland was a Parisian, the daughter of an engraver. Her maiden name was Manon Philipon. She 1 Henri Martin."], [567, "THE QUEEN OF FRANCE. 485 had married a man much older than herself, who had inspired her with a profound esteem, by his virtues, his knowledge, and his patriotism. Roland de la Platicre, inspector of manufactories, had long served his country by patient labors for her economic and industrial inter ests; he now sought to serve her in a political sense, by devoting himself to the Revolution. His wife enthusi astically joined in the opinions which Roland maintained with an austere gravity. \"Enthusiasm in Madame Roland had, from her first youth, been united with serious meditations. She was so penetrated by the ideas and sentiments of Rousseau, that one might have said he had transmitted his soul to her, and that she was his daughter. \" But if she had inherited Rousseau's ideas and senti ments, she had not inherited his weaknesses. She was as strong, as much mistress of herself, of her inclinations, of her actions, of her imagination, as Rousseau had been the contrary, at least during the first half of his life. She had so profited by his lessons as not to follow his example. \" Her voice had first been heard, although her name had not been known, at the time of the Lyonnais federa tion of 1790; then from the environs of Lyons, where she dwelt with her husband, she came to Paris in 1791. Their little salon in the Rue Guen\u00a3gaud soon became the ren dezvous of deputies and journalists of the most advanced opinion, \u2014 Brissot, Petion, Robespierre, Camille Desmou lins, Buzot, Gregoire, and others. Madame Roland from the very first exercised over all an extraordinary attrac tion, whose effect upon many, and the best, did not cease until her death. \" She was then thirty-seven years old, but she appeared much younger. Her face, animated and expressive, pro-"], [568, "486 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. duced a more vivid impression than regular beauty. Her forehead, ample and full of thought, seemed that of a man of genius ; but her gracious expression, her whole person, had the true womanly charm. Her large eyes, so proud, so sweet, penetrated to the depths of your soul. All in her was strength, goodness, honesty ; and grace gave all these other advantages their full value. \"It was, so to speak, the very idea of the Republic which took form in this woman. In her was personified a second epoch of the Revolution, which was no longer the constituent epoch. \"Beyond that great Assembly which had overthrown the ancient rigime, but which wished still to retain a king, Madame Roland from the moment of her arrival in Paris had perceived other things in the future. At the time of the king's flight, she, who until then had kept modestly in the shade behind her husband, wrote and caused others to write on all sides to the provinces to urge the societies affiliated with the Jacobins and the primary assemblies to consult France, and learn whether she wished to maintain royalty. She and her husband were fully decided that it ought not to be maintained.\" l The damp, dark cell assigned to Madame Roland in the Conciergerie was, by singular coincidence, next to that in which the queen had been imprisoned. Provi dence seemed to have permitted these two remarkable women to be thus brought by different routes to the same dungeon, and thence to the same scaffold. Marie Antoi nette had fallen from her throne ; Madame Roland from her pinnacle of power as the recipient of the first honors of the Republic. Royal queen and republican queen, both were brought to the same direful doom. While in her prison, Madame Roland's cell was surrounded by thieves 1 Henri Martin."], [569, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 487 and disreputable women, who fought and brawled day and night ; but no sooner did she step forth among them than their clamor ceased, and they crowded round her, and looked up to her as a saint, and with breathless silence listened to her musical voice as she spoke to them words of encouragement and counsel. The approach to the scaffold seemed to give a more ethereal character to her beauty, and her voice, tremulous with the emotion which her self-control held in check, refusing to give way to the weakness of tears, which unshed tears, however, found vent in the thrilling intonations of her voice, stirred the listeners' hearts with overpowering sorrow or enthusiasm as her theme changed from personal suffer ings to the glories of patriotism. During the few days she spent in the Conciergerie, by her presence and her words she spread enthusiasm for the Republic and per sonal contempt for death among the numerous prisoners gathered there. Even the most abject and depressed became enthused by her heroic self-abnegation. \" Standing on a stone bench elevated a little above the ground, and clasping her fingers round the iron bars that separated the opening between the cloister and the court, she found her tribune in her prison, and her audience in her companions to the scaffold. While her enemies were preparing the formalities of her accusation, merely a few feet above where she stood, her voice, like that of pos terity, reproached them from the very dungeons of the Conciergerie. Her eloquence drew no tears from her audience \u2014 she would have been displeased at such a manifestation of weakness ; but at each pause she made, loud cries of admiration burst from those who heard her. The prisoners would listen to her for hours, and when compelled to return to their cells, would depart, shouting enthusiastically, 'Vive la Republique!' No slander was"], [570, "488 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. uttered against liberty : on the contrary, it was wor shipped even in the dungeons hollowed in its name.\"1 As the end drew near, Madame Roland sent to a scientific friend for poison ; but he persuaded her not to carry out her purpose of suicide, and he urged rather \" the exam ple she should set, her duty to her country, the value of martyrdom in a good cause \" ; and she yielded, and awaited death. The following portrait of Madame Roland was drawn by Limontez : \u2014 \" I had seen Madame Roland several times before 1789. Her eyes, figure, and hair were remarkable, and her deli cate complexion had a freshness of color which, joined to a reserved yet candid air, made her appear singularly young. I did not see in her the easy gracefulness of a Parisian, which she attributed to herself in her memoirs ; I do not mean to say that she was awkward, because what is simple and natural can never want grace. I remember that the first time I saw her she realized my idea of the granddaughter of Vevay, who turned so many heads, and of the Julie of J. J. Rousseau, and when I heard her speak, the illusion was still more complete. \" Madame Roland spoke even too well. Self-love would have liked to find some preparation in what she said, but it was impossible ; it was simply a too perfect nature. Wit, good sense, propriety of expression, lively argument, and simple grace, \u2014 all these flowed without study from between those ivory teeth and rosy lips ; all power must yield to them. \"During the Revolution I saw Madame Roland but once ; it was at the commencement of her husband's first ministry. She had lost nothing of her freshness, youth fulness, and simplicity. Her husband looked like a 1 Lamartine."], [571, "MADAME ROLAND."], [572, ""], [573, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 489 Quaker, and her father; and her child flew around her, with beautiful hair falling to her waist. It seemed as if the inhabitants of Pennsylvania had been introduced into the salons of M. de Calonne.\" \"On November 10th, 1793 (the 18th Brumaire), Madame Roland was summoned before the Revolutionary Tribu nal. When she left her cell, clad in white, her dark hair floating loosely over her shoulders, a smile on her lips, and her face sparkling with life and animation, all the women in the prison fell at her feet, kissing her hands, and recom mending her to Heaven's care. She replied kindly to all, bidding them to be brave, peaceful, and hopeful. She was condemned in advance, not being allowed a word in her own defence, and was declared guilty of being an author or accomplice 'of a monstrous conspiracy against the unity and indivisibility of the Republic' She heard her sentence calmly, saying to the judges, 'You deem me worthy the fate of the great men you have murdered. I will try to display the same courage on the scaffold.' She was taken directly to the Place de la Revolution, a man condemned for treason being placed in the same cart. He was overwhelmed with terror. She passed the mournful journey in soothing him, and reaching the scaffold, bade him mount first, that his sufferings might not be prolonged.\" l As she took her place in turn, her eye fell on a colossal statue of Liberty, erected August 10th, 1793. \" 0 Liberty ! \" she cried, \" what crimes are committed in thy name ! \" Some say that she cried, \" 0 Liberty ! how they have deceived thee ! \" \" Noble white vision, with its high, queenly face, its soft, proud eyes, long black hair flowing down to the girdle, and as brave a heart as ever beat in woman's 1 Henri Martin."], [574, "490 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. bosom ! Serenely complete, she shines in that black wreck of things \u2014 long memorable.\" \" Thus died one of the noblest women in history since the incomparable Joan who saved France. Madame Roland did not save liberty, but died gloriously for it, leaving a triumphant example to posterity of grandeur of soul and republican virtues.\" Her husband was concealed at Rouen for some months ; but upon hearing of his wife's death, he committed suicide, and his bleeding corpse was found pierced with two wounds, and a note in his pocket which read, \"Who ever finds me lying here, respect my remains. They are those of an honest man.\" M. Roland was accused of complicity in the September massacre ; but some histo rians claim that he was utterly powerless to prevent those awful deeds. Buzot survived Madame Roland only a few months. But the bloody tribunal did not stop. Famous men of every party fell victims to it. Four days prior to the execution of Madame Roland, the Duke of Orleans had perished upon the scaffold. The day after Madame Roland's trial, that of Bailly, ex-mayor of Paris, began. Martin says : \" The affray on the Champ de Mars, July 17th, 1791, had left resentment rankling in Parisian minds, which now revived fiercely. In point of fact, neither Bailly nor La Fayette gave the order to fire on the peo ple ; but Bailly, partly through weakness, partly through mistaken generosity, accepted the responsibility of evils he did not cause. Refinements of cruelty were added to his sentence. His execution was to take place, not on the Place de la Revolution, but on the Champ de Mars, the scene of what they called his crime. But when he reached the spot, the hireling mob cried out that the Field of the Federation should never be soiled by the blood of such a"], [575, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 491 criminal ; and the scaffold was removed to a neighboring ditch, where the illustrious old man patiently awaited the end of his tortures in an icy November storm, amid jeers and insults, uttering one phrase worthy of record in history: 'I die for the session of the Tennis-Court, not for the day on the Champ de Mars.' \" Seven of the proscribed Girondists, \u2014 Guadet, Barba- roux, Buzot, Petion, Valady, Louvet, and Salles \u2014 had fled, hoping to save their lives. Madam Bouquey, the sister-in-law of Gaudet, had prepared a retreat for them in a catacomb. Here she supplied them with food, and when the search for them was relaxed, she received them into her house. But as the news of the execution of Madame Roland reached them, a rumor was also spread of their retreat, and they were forced to seek new asylums. Gaudet and Salles were captured and taken to Bordeaux and executed. Louvet escaped to Paris, while Barbaroux, Potion, and Buzot fled to the woods, and Valady took the route of the Pyrenees, where death awaited him. As Barbaroux, Petion, and Buzot approached the village of Chatillon, it was a site day in the village, and hearing the sound of the fife and drum, the poor weary fugitives imagined that the roll-call was beaten, and that soon the fields would be full of men seeking their lives. They were observed by some shep- herds to halt for a moment under the shelter of a hedge. Suddenly the report of firearms was heard, and the shepherds beheld two men fleeing with all speed into the surrounding woods. Hastening to the spot, they found a young man bleeding upon the ground. He had shivered his jaw with a pistol-shot. His mutilated tongue allowed him no language but by signs. He was of large stature and noble form. The shepherds bore him to the village of Chatillon. His linen was marked with"], [576, "492 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. an R. and a B. The people asked him if he were Buzot, he shook his head ; they then inquired if he were Bar baroux, and he nodded in the affirmative. The terribly wounded man was then borne to Bordeaux, where he was recognized by the beauty of his form ; and his blood thirsty persecutors carried him, mangled as he was, upon the scaffold, and the guillotine severed his mutilated head from his body. The fate of Petion and Buzot is obscure. \"No one knows what the forests and darkness conceal regarding them. Mystery, that most terrible of all fates, involves in obscurity the last moments of Buzot and Potion. The gleaners only, some days after the death of Barbaroux, found here and there in a cornfield, at the confines of a wood, torn hats, shoes, and some tatters of human remains, rent in pieces by the wolves. These garments, these remains, were all that were ' left of Petion and Buzot. The soil of the Republic could not even find sepulture for the men who had established it.\" 2 Barnave, who, since the 18th of August, 1792, when the last attempt was made in vain to induce the army to rise in favor of Louis XVI., had retired to Grenoble, his native city. He was there arrested in 1794, and confined for ten months in the fort Barreaux, which was situated in the frozen regions of the mountains which bound France and Savoy. He was near the frontier. His windows were not barred, and he was not very closely guarded. He could easily have fled ; but he would not do so. \" Obscure, I would save myself,\" said he ; \" but celebrated and responsible for the great acts of the Revolution, I must remain to answer for my opinions with my head, and for my honor with my blood.\" On being conducted to Paris, Danton sought to save 1 Lamartine."], [577, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 493 him, but in vain. The only favor which Barnave obtained was the privilege of embracing for the last time his mother and sister, who had followed him to Paris. Duport was associated in the condemnation of Barnave. When sentenced to death, Duport said disdainfully to his judges : \" In a revolution the people kill men ; pos terity judges them.\" Barnave and Duport were led together to the scaffold. Still young at the time of the death of Louis XV, his last favorite, Madame du Barry, had been sequestered for some time in a convent, and afterwards lived in mag nificent splendor in the Pavilion de Luciennes, on the borders of the forest of St. Germain. She kept up almost regal state by means of the immense riches which had been given to her by Louis XV., so that her exile was nearly as brilliant as her reign. The old Duke de Bris sac still remained attached to the favorite, and after the 10th of August, deeming France unsafe, with the duke's help she buried a large part of her wealth, in the shape of diamonds and jewels and plate, at the foot of a tree in her park at Luciennes, and she de parted for England. There she might have remained in security, but after the death of the Duke de Brissac, who was massacred at Versailles, Madame du Barry did not wish to impart to any one else the secret of her buried treasures. She resolved to return to France, and secure her diamonds and carry them back to London. During her absence, her estate had been confided to the care of a young negro named Zamore, whom Madame du Barry had befriended as a protegi many years before. So great had been her attachment for this young black, that she had even had him painted by her side in her portraits, that his swarthy skin might bring out in greater prominence her own fair beauty. She had lavished upon"], [578, "494 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Zamore almost motherly kindness, and had provided for him every advantage ; but he was cruel and ungrateful. When Madame du Barry returned to France, Zamore betrayed her to the Revolutionary committee of Lu ciennes, of which he was a member, having become a wild enthusiast of the Revolution. \"Judged and con demned without discussion, she went to death amidst the yells of the populace and the contempt of the indifferent. She was still in the brilliancy of hardly matured age. She was dressed in white ; her black hair, cut behind the head by the scissors of the executioner, left her neck exposed. Her locks in front of the head, which the exe cutioner had not shortened, floated and covered her eyes and her cheeks ; she lifted her head and threw them back, in order that her countenance might move the people. She did not cease to invoke pity in the most humiliating terms. Tears flowed incessantly from her eyes upon her bosom. Her piercing cries prevailed over the noise of the wheels and the clamor of the multitude. It seemed as if the knife struck this woman beforehand, and deprived her a thousand times of life. ' Life ! life ! ' she cried, ' life for my repentance ! life for all my devo tion to the Republic ! life for all my riches to the nation ! ' The people laughed and shrugged their shoulders. They showed her, by signs, the pillow of the guillotine, upon which her charming head was about to sleep. The pas sage of the courtesan to the scaffold was but one lamen tation. Under the knife she still wept. She alone, amongst all the women executed in the French Revolu tion, died a coward because she died neither for opinion, for virtue, nor for love, but for vice. She dishonored the scaffold as she had dishonored the throne.\" * On the last day of 1793 General Biron, famous at 1 Laniartine."], [579, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 495 court under the name of the Duke de Lauzun, was exe cuted. He was brave but flippant, and met his death with a levity which was not fortitude, but bravado. He had followed La Fayette to America and made himself an enthusiast of liberty, not as a virtue, but only because it was the fashion. He gave his name, his arm, and his blood to the Republic. He was adored by his soldiers, but he was envied by the plebeian gen erals. Quarrels broke out in La Vendee between Rossig nol, the Jacobin general, and Biron, and General Biron was sacrificed. Taken to Paris, condemned to death, and imprisoned in the Conciergerie, he manifested a sang froid of manner which ill comports with the gravity of approaching death. \" Bring me some oysters and white wine ! \" he cried gayly to his jailers. While he was par taking almost merrily of this last repast, the execu tioners entered his cell. \" Permit me to finish my oysters,\" said Biron to them. \" In the line you follow you must require strength,\" he continued ; \" will you not drink with me ? \" So gallant, proud, and indifferent was this aristocrat as he met his doom. Such defiant bravery seems hardly to be worthy of applause. Digni fied gravity in the face of death is not incompatible with courage, and seems more fitting on the verge of eternity. Four thousand six hundred detenus awaited their judg ment in the prisons of Paris alone. Fouquier-Tinville was not able to draw up the accusations singly, but massed them together, almost by chance. He no longer left the cabinet of the hall of justice, where he drew up these unlawful accusations. Eating and sleeping at the tribunal, he was yet unable to make out these death decrees fast enough to satisfy the bloodthirsty Com mittee of Public Safety, \u2014 more rightly should it have been named Committee of Public Destruction ! \" Fouquier-"], [580, "496 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Tinville believed himself to be the arm of the people, the axe of the Republic, and the thunder of the Revolu tion.\" One life spared, one guilty person forgotten, one accused acquitted, grieved him. Sometimes, however, even the cruel heart of Fouquier- Tinville was moved by the sublimity of spirit displayed by some of the accused. A touching account is given of M. Legrand d'Alleray, one of the aged members of Par liament, almost all of whom, in turn, died upon the scaffold. M. Legrand d'Alleray, an honest old gentleman, loved and respected by all who knew him, bowed down by the weight of years, with his aged wife, was led to the Revo lutionary Tribunal, accused of corresponding with their son, an emigrant in exile. The sight of this white haired couple moved even the stern-souled Fouquier- Tinville to pity. Making a sign of intelligence to M. Legrand d'Alleray, Tinville said aloud: \"This is the letter which accuses you ; but I know your handwriting. I have often had documents of yours under my inspec tion, while you sat in Parliament. This letter is not yours ; the characters are visibly counterfeited.\" \" Pass the letter to me,\" said the noble old man. Then, after having examined the writing with much care, he said, \" You are mistaken. This letter is in my hand writing.\" Fouquier, confounded by this sincerity, which thwarted his hope to save him, still made another attempt. \" There is a law,\" said he to the accused, \" which forbids the parents of emigrants to correspond with their rela tives, and to send them any assistance, under pain of death : this law you doubtless were not aware of ? \" \"You are still mistaken,\" answered M. Legrand d'Al leray. \" I knew this law. But I know another, engraven"], [581, "497 THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. by nature in the hearts of all fathers and mothers. It is that which commands them to sacrifice their lives in order to succor their children.\" Amazed at this unlooked-for truthfulness, Fouquier still tried five or six times to frame excuses for the prisoner, all of which M. d'Alleray eluded by his refusal to depart in the slightest degree from the truth ; and at length, perceiving Fouquier's intention, the honest old gentleman exclaimed, \" I thank you for the efforts you have made to save me ; but it would be necessary to purchase our lives by a lie. My wife and myself prefer rather to die. We have grown old together without ever having lied ; we will not do so now to save a rem nant of life. Do your duty ; we will do ours. We will not accuse you of our death ; we will accuse the law only.\" The juries wept from emotion; and the courageous old couple were followed to the scaffold by many whose profoundest admiration and respect could not but be awakened by so sublime a devotion to honor and truth. Lamartine says : \" The year 1794 was inaugurated in blood. The guillotine appeared to be the only institu tion in France. Danton and Saint-Just had caused the suspension of the constitution, and the Revolutionary government to be proclaimed. The law was the Com mittee of Public Safety ; the administration was the arbitrary will of the commissioners of the Convention. Justice was suspicion or vengeance ; the guarantee was denunciation. The government was the scaffold.\" The Convention was compelled to strike, or to be struck itself. The prisons of Paris were filled with victims. From these various prisons those who were to be tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal were taken to the Concier gerie."], [582, "498 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. A trial was almost certain death. The guillotine in cessantly dropped its gory knife. Fifteen, thirty,' sixty, and at last one hundred and fifty were taken to the scaffold at one time. Gutters had been placed at the foot of the scaffold, to carry off the continual river of blood. Sometimes several generations in a family were destroyed at once. Malesherbes, eighty years of age, was guillotined with his sister, his daughter, his son-in-law, his grandson, and his granddaughter. The heartless turnkeys went through the prisons at midnight, and, rousing the wretched prisoners from their restless slumbers and their dreams of terror, they read the list of the accused to the poor trembling creatures, each one breathlessly expecting his name to be the next. Often an act of accusation against one person was served by mistake or careless cruelty upon another. The Duchess of Biron was judged by an act drawn up against her agent. A boy of sixteen, by the name of Mallet, was arrested under an indictment for a man of forty, named Bellay. \" What is your age ? \" inquired the president of the tribunal, as the lad was brought before him. \" Sixteen,\" replied the youth. \" Well, you are quite forty in crime,\" said the brutal magistrate. \" Take him to the guillotine.\" Forty young women were brought to the scaffold for having danced at a ball given by the king of Prussia at Verdun. But Paris was not the only scene of blood. The in habitants of Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon rose in revolt against the Jacobins, and raised the banner of the Bour bons, and invited the approach of the allies. At Toulon, the Royalists signalled to the English fleet, and sur rendered to them the forts, shipping, and stores. An"], [583, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 499 army of sixty thousand men were sent by the Conven tion against Lyons. The city was seized, and the Con vention decreed that the city should be utterly destroyed. The cruelties inflicted upon this unfortunate city were terrible. Six thousand of the inhabitants perished in the massacres, and twelve thousand were driven into exile. Hundreds of victims were thrown into the river Loire. This wholesale butchery was accompanied with the most atrocious brutality. The victims were bound together in couples, \u2014 a priest with a nun, a young man with a young girl, \u2014 and then flung into the river. This demoniacal sport was mockingly termed, \"Republican marriages.\" \" Terror reigned in the unfortunate city of Lyons. The commissioners sent to punish it, intoxicated with the blood they spilt, fancying, at every shriek of anguish, that they beheld rebellion again springing into life, wrote to the Convention that the aristocrats were not yet reduced, and that, to remove all further ground for apprehension, it was necessary to displace one part of the population, and destroy the other. As the means employed did not seem sufficiently expeditious, Collot d'Herbois conceived the idea of resorting to mining for the purpose of destroying the buildings, and to grape shot for sacrificing the proscribed ; and he wrote to the Convention that he should soon adopt more speedy and more efficacious means for punishing the rebel city. \" Attended by a crowd of satellites, Couthon traversed the finest quarters of Lyons, with a silver hammer, and, striking at the door of the devoted houses, exclaimed, ' Rebellious house, I strike you in the name of the law ! ' Instantly the agents of destruction, of whom twenty thousand were in the pay of the Convention, levelled the dwelling to the ground. But this was only a prelude"], [584, "500 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to a more bloody vengeance. Collot-d'Herbois was ani mated with a secret hatred towards the inhabitants of Lyons ; for, ten years before, when an obscure actor, he had been hissed off their stage. He now resolved at leisure to gratify his revenge. Fouche, his worthy asso ciate, published, before his arrival, a proclamation in which he declared that the French people could ac knowledge no other worship than that of universal morality; that all religious emblems should be de stroyed ; and that over the gates of the churchyard should be written, ' Death is an eternal sleep ! ' \"Proceeding on these atheistical principles, the first step of Collot-d'Herbois and Fouche was to institute a fete in honor of Chalier, the Republican governor of Lyons, who had been put to death during the first insur rection. His bust was carried through the streets, fol lowed by an immense crowd of assassins and drunken women. After them came an ass, bearing the Gospel, the cross, and the communion-vases ; which were soon com mitted to the flames, while the ass was compelled to drink, out of the communion-cup, the consecrated wine ! The exe cutions meantime continued without the slightest relaxa tion. Many women watched for the hour when their husbands were to pass to the scaffold, precipitated them selves upon the chariot, and voluntarily suffered death by their side. Daughters surrendered their honor to save their parents' lives; but their monster jailers, add ing treachery to crime, led them out to behold the execu tion of their relatives ! Deeming the daily execution of fifteen or twenty persons too tardy a display of Repub lican vengeance, Collot-d'Herbois prepared a new and simultaneous mode of punishment. Sixty captives of both sexes were led out together, tightly bound in a file to the Place du Brotteaux, where they were arranged in"], [585, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 501 two files, with a deep ditch on each side, which was to be their place of sepulture, while gendarmes with up lifted sabres threatened with instant death whoever moved from their position. At the extremity of the file, two cannon loaded with grape were so placed as to enfilade the whole. The signal was then given, and the guns were fired. Broken limbs, torn off by the shot, were scattered in every direction, while the blood flowed in torrents into the ditches on either side of the line. A second and third discharge were insufficient to complete the work of destruction, till at length the gendarmes, unable to witness such protracted sufferings, rushed in, and despatched the survivors with their sabres. \" On the following day this bloody scene was renewed on a still greater scale. Two hundred and nine cap tives were brought before the Revolutionary judges, and, with scarcely a hearing, condemned to be executed to gether. With such precipitance was the affair conducted, that two commissaries of the prison were led out along with their captives : their cries, their protestations, were alike disregarded. In crossing a bridge the error was discovered on the captives being counted; and it was intimated to Collot-d'Herbois that there were too many. ' What signifies it,' said he, ' that there are too many ? If they die to-day, they cannot die to-morrow.' The whole number were brought to the place of execu tion, where they were attached to one cord made fast to trees at stated intervals, with their hands tied behind their backs, and numerous pickets of soldiers disposed so as at one discharge to destroy them all. At a given signal the fusillade commenced; but few were killed; the greater part had only a jaw or a limb broken; and uttering the most piercing cries, they broke loose in their agony from the rope, and were cut down by the gen-"], [586, "502 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. darmes. The great numbers who survived the discharge rendered the work of destruction a most laborious opera tion, and several were still breathing on the following day, when their bodies were mingled with quicklime, and cast into a common grave. Collot-d'Herbois and Fouche were witnesses of this butchery from a distance, by means of telescopes which they directed to the spot. All the other fusillades were conducted in the same man ner. One of them was executed under the windows of an hotel on the Quay, where Fouche, with thirty Jaco bins and twenty dissolute women, were engaged at dinner. They rose from table to enjoy the bloody spectacle. The bodies of the slain were floated in such numbers down the Rhone that the waters were poisoned. During the course of five months upwards of six thousand persons suffered death, and more than double that number were driven into exile. \"One day, during the bloody executions which took place at Lyons, a young girl rushed into the hall where the Revolutionary Tribunal was held, and throwing her self at the feet of the judges said, ' There remain to me of all my family only my brothers ! Mother, father, sis ters, uncles, you have butchered all, and now you are going to condemn my brothers. Ah, in mercy, ordain that I may ascend the scaffold with them ! ' Her prayer, accompanied as it was with all the marks of frantic despair, was refused. She then threw herself into the Rhone, where she perished. \" The greatest atrocities were committed at Bordeaux. A woman was charged with the heinous crime of having cried at the execution of her husband ; she was con demned, in consequence, to sit several hours under the suspended blade, which shed upon her, drop by drop, the blood of the deceased, whose corpse was above her on the"], [587, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 503 scaffold, before she was released by death from her agony.\" * \" In the early days of the Revolution religious violence was purely political, not attacking worship per se; but in the autumn of 1793 an attack was made on Catholicism, the legal worship. People were no longer content to transform gold and silver church ornaments into money, and the bronze and copper ones into bullets and cannon, but destroyed statues and altars in various places. Rep resentatives sent on missions encouraged these demon strations, and the ex-priest Fouche urged the authorities of Nevers to suppress worship and send their church treasures to the Convention. Emissaries from Revolu tionary committees, with similar gifts, more than once appeared before the Convention arrayed in mitres, copes, and chasubles, which they had stolen from sacristies. The Paris sections, at the instigation of Hebert and Chaumette, called on the Convention to cut off the sala ries of the clergy. Clootz now struck a decisive blow by inducing Archbishop Gobel of Paris, who no longer be lieved in the dogmas of the Church, to resign his office, and a formal demonstration was prepared, with Chau mette's approval. On the 7th of November, Gobel, his vicar, and many of the Parisian curates, appeared before the bar of the Convention, accompanied by the local and municipal authorities, and Gobel declared that the only national worship was the worship of Liberty and Equality, and renounced his office as a minister of the Catholic faith, his followers also laying down their priestly cre dentials. Chaumette asked that this day, wherein Reason resumed her sway, might be placed among the brilliant dates of the Revolution in the new calendar, and Laloi, the president of the Convention, replied, that ' the prac- 1 Narratives of the Reign of Terror."], [588, "504 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. tice of social and moral virtues was the only worship acceptable to God, ' thus arraying himself against Catholi cism and atheism alike. \"Thomas Lindet, bishop of JSvreux, and brother of Robert Lindet, with two other bishops and several priests, members of the Convention, also renounced their offices, as did a Protestant minister from Tou louse, and Bishop Lindet proposed that civic festivals should take the place of religious ones. Gregory, bishop of Blois, was urged to follow his colleagues' example. He was a Jansenist, and as convinced of the truth of Christianity as he was opposed to the infallibility of the Pope. ' You told of sacrifices to the country,' said he ; 'I am accustomed to them. Is this a question of love of liberty ? I proved mine long since. Do you want my salary ? Take it. Is it a question of religion ? That is beyond your domain. I was beset to accept the bur den of the bishopric at a time when it was hedged with thorns ; I am again beset to lay it down, but it shall not be wrested from me. I have tried to do good in my diocese, and I remain a bishop to continue to do so.' \"'No one shall be forced!' was the general exclama tion. His resistance was respected, for every one knew that the Revolution and the Republic had no more devoted follower. \" Chaumette, however, went on and obtained an ordsr from the general council of the Commune for a festival in honor of the fall of fanaticism, to be held in the ci-devant metropolitan church of Notre Dame (Novem ber 20, 10th Brumaire). A mountain of painted wood was built in the choir, on which was erected a temple of Reason, lighted by the ' lamp of Truth,' and the Parisian authorities, escorted by young girls dressed in white, ranged themselves below, while Reason, represented by"], [589, "THE GODDESS OF REASON"], [590, ""], [591, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 505 Mademoiselle Maillard, a famous singer, came forth to receive their homage ; thence she was led to the Conven tion with music. She wore a white robe and sky-blue mantle, with a liberty cap on her head and a pike in her hand ; and the people, who cared nothing for the abstrac tions of Clootz and Chaumette, took her for an image of Liberty and the Republic. The Convention received the party with applause, the Goddess of Reason being asked to sit beside the president, on the demand of the Com mune. Notre Dame was rechristened the Temple of Reason, and the goddess was reconducted thither ' to sing the Liberty Hymn in the midst of the people.' But the people were cold; Catholic feasts could not be replaced by a pasteboard temple and an actress dressed as Reason. \"The Convention took another step, and ordered churches and parsonages to be used as school-houses and poor-houses, thus effectually preventing public and official worship ; and the feasts of Reason, both at Paris and elsewhere, soon degenerated into mere orgies, disrep utable women playing the part of goddesses and enacting bacchanals in the churches. These scandals hastened a political crisis, and aggravated the Reign of Terror.\" 1 \" The devastation of sanctuaries and the dispersion of relics followed the inauguration of the allegorical wor ship of Reason. They burnt on the Place de Greve, a place consecrated to punishment, the remains of Sainte Genevieve, the popular patroness of Paris, and threw her ashes to the wind. They pursued the traditions of religion even to their sepulchres, whither they had al ready pursued the memories, respect, and superstition of the country. Death itself was not an inviolable asylum for the relics of the kings. A decree of the Convention had commanded, in hatred of royalty, the destruction of 1 Henri Martin."], [592, "506 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the tombs of the kings of Saint Denis. The Commune, exaggerating political power, had changed this decree into an attack against the dead, history, and humanity. It had ordered the exhumation of bones, the spoliation of the grave, the carrying away of the lead of the coffins to cast into balls. \" This sacrilegious order was executed by the commis sioners of the Commune, with all the circumstances and all the derision befitting the horror of such an act. The people, savage over these tombs, seemed to exhume their own history and scatter it to the winds. The axe broke the gates of bronze presented by Charlemagne to the Ba silica of Saint Denis. Gratings, roofings, statues, all were broken and ground to atoms under the hammer. They raised the stones, ransacked the vaults, violated the resting-places of the departed. Curiosity, blending with mockery, sought out, beneath the swathings and shrouds, embalmed corpses, crumbled flesh, calcined bones, empty skulls of kings, queens, princes, ministers, bishops, whose names had been famous in the past his tory of France. P6pin, the founder of the Carlovingian dynasty, and father of Charlemagne, was now but a pinch of gray ash, which was in a moment scattered by the wind. The mutilated heads of Turenne, Duguesclin, Louis XII., Francois I., were rolled above the pave ment. They trampled on heaps of sceptres, crowns, pastoral croziers, and historical and religious symbols. A deep fosse, in which quicklime was thrown to con sume the dead bodies, was made in the cemetery of the Valois. Perfumes were burnt in the caverns to purify the air. There were heard, after each blow of the axe, the shouts of the gravediggers, who uncovered the re mains of a king, and threw his bones heedlessly in a heap."], [593, "THE QUEEN OF THE REPUBLIC. 507 \"Beneath the choir were buried the princes and prin cesses of the first race, and some of the third, \u2014 Hugh Capet, Philip the Bold, Philip the Handsome. They rent away their rags of silk, and threw their remains on a bed of quicklime. Henry IV, embalmed with skill by Italians, preserved still his historic physiognomy. His uncovered breast displayed the two wounds whence his life had flowed away. His beard, perfumed and spread out like a fan, as in his portraits, proved the care which this voluptuous king took of his face. His mem ory, revered by the people, protected him for the moment from profanation. The multitude, for two days, silently marched round this still popular corpse. Placed in the choir, at the foot of the altar, he received, dead, the respectful homage of the mutilators of royalty. But at length one of the crowd exclaimed: 'He deceived God, his favorites, and his people ; let him not deceive pos terity and your justice ! ' They then flung the carcass of Henry IV. into the common fosse. \"His son and grandson, Louis XIII. and XIV, fol lowed. Louis XIII. was but a mummy.

Louis XV. came last out of the tomb; the infection of his reign seemed to issue from his sep ulchre. They were obliged to burn a mass of gunpowder to dissipate the mephitic odor of the corpse of this prince, whose scandalous life had degraded royalty. \" In the vault of Charles they found, beside Charles V., a hand of justice and a golden crown, and spindles and marriage-rings in the coffin of Jeanne de Bourbon, his"], [594, "508 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. wife. The vault of the Valois was empty, and the just hate of the people sought Louis XL in vain. He had been buried in one of the sanctuaries of the Virgin, whom he had so often invoked, even to aid in his crimes. \" Turenne's body, mutilated by a ball, was venerated by the people ; and it was secretly removed, and for nine years was preserved in the lofts of the Cabinet of Natu ral History in the Jardin des Plantes, amongst the stuffed remains of animals. The military tomb of the Invalides was rendered to this hero by the hands of a fellow-sol dier. Duguesclin, Suger, Venddme, heroes, abb^s, minis ters of the monarchy, were cast headlong into the earth, the recollections of their glory being confounded with the recollections of servitude. \" Dagobert I. and his wife Matilde had reposed in the same sepulchre for twelve centuries. Matilde's skeleton wanted the head, like the skeletons of several other queens. King John closed up the file of this mournful procession of the dead. They found one spoil wanting. It was that of a young princess, daughter of Louis XV, who had fled into a nunnery to avoid the scandals of the throne, and had died there under the Carmelite's habit. The vengeance of the Revolution went to seek this vir gin's body, even in the tomb of the cloister, whither she had escaped from the grandeurs of life. Her coffin was brought to Saint Denis, in order that it might be made to undergo the penalty of exhumation and exposure. No relic was spared. Nothing that had been royal was judged innocent. Brutal instinct revealed in the Rev olution the desire to repudiate all the past of France.

Carrier, a savage mountaineer from Auvergne, an at torney by practice, without talent, and with only the instincts of a brute, was sent by the Convention to Nantes, to animate the Republican party by his wild harangues. After the rout of the Royalist army, he established at Nantes his \" butchery.\" More than eight thousand victims, consisting of prisoners, and women and children, left behind by the fleeing army, had been al ready massacred. But this was nothing to the blood thirsty Carrier. He presented himself, sabre in hand, before the club of Nantes, and harangued the mob, and then shut himself up in a country villa, and, guarded by his paid satellites, shrouded himself in mystery, in order to increase the fright of the helpless people. From this den of human tigers, he sent forth his bands of murder ing marauders. The \" blood-hounds \" of Carrier scented out their prey among the rich and respectable citizens. Thousands were imprisoned in all sorts of dungeons ; and when these prisons were filled with men, women, and children, crowded together, without beds, fire, or even food, those who could not redeem their lives by pay ing ransoms were brutally murdered. The women, who refused to sell themselves to their beastly jailers, were led to execution. In his despatches to the Convention, Carrier boasted of having destroyed five hundred Frenchmen in a day, and of burying four thousand in a single pit. The Conven tion applauded the ferocious narrative, and enjoyed as an admirable jest his description of the guillotine, under the name of \" the national razor,\" and the \" little win dow \" ; and the \" noyade \" (a barge with a false bottom for drowning numbers at once) this savage wretch termed a \"bath,\" or sneeringly described the victims as \"drink ing in the great bowl.\""], [597, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 511 Death by fire and sword was not enough ; so the river Loire was employed as a vast sepulchre, where thousands of victims could be disposed of by drowning, without leaving their carcasses to be inconvenient encumbrances. Entire villages were desolated by this wholesale murder, until, at length, even the authorities were aghast at these infamous deeds, and Carrier was recalled. But the Con vention did not dare to punish him. \"But even these excesses were not equal to those by which the commanders of troops of the Revolutionary army scattered terror and devastation. Their savage atrocities combined the extremes of rapacity and cruelty, with the most brutal acts of passion, by whom whole generations were swept away in savage sport ; the aged ancestor, with his children, and his children's children, lay in one general heap. Women who were ill, and in fants at the breast, were involved in the dreadful destruction, while the disgusting violations which ac companied these bloody deeds were such as cannot even be repeated.\" 1 When the leaders of the Revolutionary Tribunal were arraigned, the following were some of the facts stated in evidence : \" George Thomas, a witness, deposed, that having received an order to visit one of the prisons, to certify as to the condition of a number of women, he found on entering the place a great number of dead bod ies strewed on the floor. 'As I hurried along through this scene of horror,' said he, 'my terrified aspect fright ened the women. They had been accustomed to see none but their butchers. I encouraged them, and addressed them in the language of humanity. I found that thirty of them were in a delicate condition. A few days after I went again to see those unhappy creatures whose situa- 1 Narratives of the Reign of Terror."], [598, "512 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION- tion rendered them objects of tenderness ; but,' added he, with a faltering voice, ' shall I tell you \u2014 they were all murdered! The farther I advanced,' continued the witness, ' the more was my heart appalled. There were eight hundred women and as many children in that one prison, and there were neither beds, straw, nor necessary vessels \u2014 the prisoners were in want of everything. Dr. Rollin and myself saw five children expire within four minutes. I accuse,' continued he, 'the committee in general of the murder of seven prisoners, whom, from want of time to examine them, they had hewn down with sabres, under the window of their hall. Carrier, their representative, as well as the committee and their assistants, turned the drownings into jest, calling them immersions, national baptisms, bathings, etc' \" Debourges, another witness, said : \" I have seen noth- ing but drownings, guillotinings, and shootings. Being once on guard, I commanded a detachment that conducted the fourth en masse of women to be shot at Gigan. When I arrived, I found the dead bodies of seventy-five women already stretched on the spot \u2014 they were en- tirely without clothing. I was informed that they were girls from fifteen to eighteen years of age. When they had the misfortune not to fall dead after the shot, they were despatched with sabres.\" Labenette, another witness, said : \" I have been an eye witness of several drownings of men, women, girls, boys, and infants indiscriminately. I have also seen persons of all those descriptions shot in the public squares. I was physician to one of the prisons, and was about to be displaced because I was too humane.\" The widow Dumeq stated herself to be the widow of the late keeper of the prison Entrepot. She said \u25a0 \" I have seen fifty priests brought there, robbed of all their"], [599, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 513 effects, and drowned with some women and little chil dren. A child of fourteen years old was tied with others to be drowned. His cries for his father would have pierced the heart of a tiger ; but he was drowned with the rest.\" Another witness, Bourdin, giving an account of the shootings he had seen, said: \"The last I saw was of eighty-eight women ; they were shot, stripped, and after wards exposed for three days. When the shootings en masse first began, the prisoners retained their clothes until they were dead. The old-clothes dealers followed them whilst going to execution, bargaining on the way with the soldiers for their garments ; but they discov ered that the clothes being shot through, and often clotted with blood, decreased their value ; the soldiers, therefore, afterwards stripped their prisoners before their execution.\" \" One day fourscore women were shot, and their naked bodies were exposed for three days ; another day saw five hundred children of both sexes, the eldest not ex ceeding fourteen years, given up to slaughter. The deputies justified this dreadful carnage of unoffending innocence, by calling them young wolves and vipers, whom it was necessary to crush. The Loire is said to have been actually discolored with blood for several miles, and whole weeks were consumed in burying the dead. Some idea may be formed of the total number of lives sacrificed, for it was estimated, in publications of that day, to be nine hundred thousand, fifteen thousand of whom were women and twenty-two thousand chil dren.\" 1 And still the prisons in Paris were more and more crowded ; over twelve thousand languished in dungeons, 1 Narratives of the Reign of Terror."], [600, "514 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. hourly awaiting death, which had come to be the most welcome release in the midst of their cruel tortures. Faster and faster worked the guillotine. Every night carts rumbled through the streets piled up with headless bodies and gory heads. It was reported that even this human guillotine-meat was being served out as food to the starving prisoners, who must thus perforce become cannibals or die of hunger. What revolting surmises haunted the frenzied brains of the poor wretches in the dungeons when their beastly jailers brought their small allowance of vile food ! Peradventure the ill-smelling meat which only an hyena would relish and which the very dogs would refuse, which now furnished the scanty meal of the poor prisoner whose limbs were bleeding from the. recent torture-rack, which had been inflicted to draw from his lips some confession of plots of which he was entirely ignorant ; peradventure this same repulsive meat might have been the flesh of his former comrade or even brother, who yesterday fell a victim to the guil lotine. Horrible as these suppositions seem, such things are declared to be facts in authentic narratives of pris oners in the prisons of Paris during the Reign of Terror. One brutal jailer Haly called this guillotine-meat a dish of ci-devants, and it was reliably reported that the police of the period ordered this horrible resource. Closely pent up in these loathsome dungeons, the tortured victims were daily terrified by the unfeeling voices of their jailers, exultingly crying out: \"Here is a list of the sixty or eighty winners in the lottery of the holy guillotine ! \" and the prisoners with blanched faces, trem bling limbs, and anguished hearts breathlessly aAvaited their turn to receive the sentence of death. Hebert's party in the Commune aspired to surpass the past party of Marat. Hebert was master of the"], [601, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 515 Commune through Pache, Payan, and Chaumette. He ruled the people through the leaders of the riots. He had influence in the Revolutionary army, through Ronsin, and he stirred up the women to acts of violence, through the wild harangues of the actress, Rose Lacombe, and others of her class. These bands of lawless women, dressed in red trousers, and flaunting the patriotic cock ades, paraded the streets and boldly insulted all modest women who dared to appear without these badges of Republican fervor. Through his journal, the \" Pere Duchesne,\" Hubert attacked Robespierre and Danton. The motive which governed his party was neither liberty nor patriotism ; but rather the wildest license, with no respect for religion, law, or even decency. One evening in January, Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and Souberbielle, one of the jury of the Revolutionary Tribunal, were retiring from the Palais de Justice to gether. It had been a day of blood. Fifteen heads had been guillotined since morning, on the Place de la Revolution, and sentence of death had been passed on twenty -seven more. As the three men reached the Pont Neuf , Danton exclaimed : \u2014 \"Do you know that at the pace we are now going, there will speedily be no safety for any person ? The best patriots are confounded heedlessly with traitors. Blood shed by generals on the field of battle does not spare them from spilling the rest on the scaffold. I am weary of living. Look ! See there ! The river seems to flow with blood ! \" \" 'Tis true,\" replied Souberbielle, \" the sky is red ; and there are many showers of blood behind those clouds ! Those men demanded inflexible judges, but now they only seek for complaisant executioners. When I refuse"], [602, "516 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. an innocent head to their knife, they say I am in sym pathy with traitors. What can I do ? I am but an obscure patriot. Ah, if I were only Danton ! \" \" Danton sleeps \u2014 but he will awake at the right mo ment,\" rejoined Danton. \" But all this begins to excite horror in me. I am a man of the Revolution, and not a man of slaughter ; but you,\" addressing Camille, \" why do you keep silence ? \" \"I am weary of silence,\" answered Camille; \"my hand weighs heavily, and I have sometimes the impulse to sharpen my pen into a dagger and stab these scoun drels. Let them beware ! My ink is more indelible than their blood ; it stains for immortality ! \" \" Bravo, Camille ! \" cried Danton ; \" begin from to morrow. You began the Revolution; be it you who shall now most strongly urge it. Be assured, this hand shall aid you. You know whether or not it be strong.\" The three friends then separated. The next day Camille Desmoulins sharpened his pen into a dagger, and wrote the first number of the \" Vieux Cordelier.\" But it proved to be a dagger unconsciously aimed at his own throat as well as against his enemies. The brutal party of Hubert and Chaumette, unmasked by the cutting accusations of Camille, and at length boldly attacked by Danton and Robespuerre, in turn experienced the same bloody death they had so ruthlessly meted out to others. With others of their party they were led to the scaffold, and Danton and Robespierre stood at the head of the Republican faction. Taine says of Danton : \" In temperament and charac ter he was a barbarian, and a barbarian born to command his fellow-creatures. A colossus with the head of a ' Tartar,' pitted with the small-pox, tragically and terri bly ugly, with a mask convulsed like that of a growling"], [603, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 517 ' bull-dog ' ; with small, cavernous, restless eyes buried under the huge wrinkles of a threatening brow ; with a thundering voice, and moving and acting like a combat ant, full-blooded, boiling over with passion and energy, his strength in its outbursts seeming illimitable like the forces of nature ; roaring like a bull when speaking, and heard through closed windows fifty yards off in the street, employing immoderate imagery, intensely in earnest, trembling with indignation, revenge, and patriotic senti ments ; able to arouse savage instincts in the most tran quil breast, and generous instincts in the most brutal; profane, using emphatic terms ; cynical, full of coarse jests worthy of Rabelais ; possessing a stock of jovial sensuality and good-humor, cordial and familiar in his ways, frank, friendly in tone, \u2014 in short, outwardly and inwardly the best fitted for winning the confidence and sympathy of a Gallic, Parisian populace, and ail contrib uting to the formation of his ' inborn, practical popular ity,' and to make of him ' a grand seignior of sansculot terie.'\" Eglantine one day said to Danton : \" Do you know of what you are accused ? They say that you have only launched the car of the Revolution to enrich yourself, while Robespierre has remained poor in the midst of the monarchical treasures thrown at his feet.\" \" Well,\" replied Danton, \" do you know what that proves ? That I love gold, and that Robespierre loves blood. Robespierre is afraid of money lest it should stain his hands.\" The celebrated pamphlet, \"Le Vieux Cordelier,\" pub lished by Camille Desmoulins, fell like a bomb-shell into the midst of the bloody Commune. His words were fearless and powerful. While pretending to describe Rome under the Emperors, he thus graphically sketches"], [604, "518 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the condition of France : \" Everything under that terri ble government was made the groundwork of suspicion. Does a citizen avoid society and live retired by his fire side ? That is to ruminate in private on sinister designs. Is he rich ? That renders the danger greater that he will corrupt the citizens by his largesses. Is he poor ? None so dangerous as those who have nothing to lose. Is he thoughtful and melancholy ? He is revolving what he calls the calamities of his country. Is he gay and dissipated ? He is concealing, like C\u00e6sar, ambition under the mask of pleasure. The natural death of a celebrated man has become so rare that historians trans mit it, as a matter worthy of record, to future ages. The tribunals, once the protectors of life and property, have become the mere organs of butchery.\" Speaking of Hubert, Desmoulins wrote : \" Hehert, the head of this turbulent and atrocious faction, is a misera ble intriguer, a caterer for the guillotines, a traitor paid by Pitt, a thief expelled for theft from his office of check taker at a theatre.\" The Hehertists being removed from the path of Robes pierre by execution, this treacherous hypocrite at length determined to sacrifice Danton and Camille Desmoulins. The former was his rival, and therefore to be dreaded ; the latter had alarmed the Committee of Public Safety by his bold invectives against the Reign of Terror, and Robespierre feared he himself might be implicated. To save himself from suspicion he became the accuser of his two friends. Danton, disgusted with carnage, had with drawn from the Committee of Public Safety. At this time Robespierre and Danton met at a dinner party, and Danton boldly denounced the acts of the Revolutionary Tribunal, while Robespierre stoutly de fended them. They parted in anger."], [605, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 519 Danton's friends, fearful of results, urged him to fly ; hut Danton exclaimed: \"My life is not worth the trouble. I am weary of blood. I had rather be guillo tined than be a guillotiner. They dare not attack me. I am stronger than they.\" The Committee of Public Safety held a secret session by night. They accused Danton of the \"treason of clemency.\" A friend rushed to Danton's house and warned him of his peril. Danton's young wife besought him, with tears, to escape ; but he replied, \" They will deliberate long before they will dare to strike a man like me. While they deliberate, I will surprise them.\" He retired to bed. At six in the morning, gen darmes entered his room with the order for his arrest. \"They dare, then?\" said Danton; \"they are bolder than I thought them.\" Dressing hastily, he embraced his weeping wife, and was led to the Luxembourg, where Camille Desmoulins and fourteen others, supposed to be partisans of Danton, had already been imprisoned. As Danton entered his dungeon, he exclaimed, \" At length I perceive that in revolutions the supreme power ultimately rests with the most abandoned.\" When Danton was first brought to the Luxembourg and entered the prison, a crowd of curious persons who were also confined within its gloomy walls gathered around him to gaze with wonder upon this distinguished leader of the Jacobins, now so strangely numbered with themselves. Perceiving their looks of amazement, he said to them: \"Yes, it is Danton. Behold him atten tively. The trick is well played. We must know how to praise our enemies when they behave adroitly. I would never have believed that Robespierre could have juggled me thus.\" Then with softened tones he added :"], [606, "520 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. \" Gentlemen, I hoped to have been the means of deliver ing you all from this place ; but here I am among you, and no one can tell where this will end.\" Great excitement was produced in the Assembly by these important arrests. Legendre, a friend of Danton's, ventured to ascend the tribune. \"Citizens,\" he said, \"four members of this Assembly have been arrested during the night. Danton is one. I know not the others. Citizens, I declare that I believe Danton to be as pure as myself ; yet he is in a dungeon. They feared, no doubt, that his replies would overturn the accusations brought against him. I move, therefore, that before you listen to any report, you send for the prisoners and hear them.\" Robespierre immediately mounted the tribune and replied : \u2014 \"By the unusual agitation which prevades this As sembly, by the sensation the words of the speaker you have just heard have produced, it is manifest that a question of great interest is before us, \u2014 a question whether two or three individuals shall be preferred to the country. The question to-day is, whether the inter ests of certain ambitious hypocrites shall prevail over the interests of the French nation. Legendre appears not to know the names of those who have been arrested. \" The Convention knows them. His friend Lacroix is among the prisoners. Why does he appear to be igno rant of it ? Because he knows that he cannot defend La croix without shame. He has spoken of Danton, doubt less because he thinks that a privilege is attached to this name. No ! we will have no privilege. No ! we will have no idols. We shall see to-day whether the Con vention will break a false idol, long since decayed, or whether in its fall it will crush the Convention and the French people."], [607, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 521 \" I say, whoever now trembles is guilty, for never does innocence dread public surveillance. Me, too, have they tried to alarm. It has been attempted to make me be lieve that the danger which threatens Danton might reach me. I have been written to. The friends of Danton have sent me their letters ; have besieged me with their importunities. They have thought that the remembrance of a former acquaintance, that a past belief in false virtues, might determine me to relax in my zeal and my passion for liberty. Well, then, I declare that none of these motives have touched my soul with the slightest impression ; my life is for my countiy, my heart is exempt from fear. \"I have seen in the flattery which has been addressed to me, in the concern of those who surrounded Danton, only signs of the terror which they felt even before they were threatened. And I, too, have been the friend of P6tion ; as soon as he was unmasked I abandoned him. I have also been acquainted with Roland ; he became a traitor, and I denounced him. Danton would take their place, and in my eyes he is but an enemy to his country.\" Robespierre had chosen well his moment, and craftily worded his hypocritical harangue. The Assembly were alarmed. Legendre tremblingly attempted to retract his declarations, and the members voted the impeach ment of Danton and his friends. Mignet says : \" Every one sought to gain time with tyranny, and gave up others' heads to save his own.\" The young and brilliant Camille Desmoulins, when cast into prison, seized the first opportunity to write to his beautiful wife, whom he idolized. When arrested he had exclaimed in anguish, \"This, then, is the rec ompense of the first voice of the Revolution.\" He had lifted up his voice in an appeal for clemency for the peo-"], [608, "522 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. pie, but his pen had become a dagger too late ; would that he had sooner employed his sparkling genius in the people's defence, instead of writing the cutting sarcasms which aided rather than weakened their enemies ! In his dungeon-cell he thus writes to his wife : \u2014 \" My prison recalls to my mind the garden where I spent eight years in beholding you. A glimpse of the garden of the Luxembourg brings back to me a crowd of remembrances of our loves. I am alone, but never have I been in thought, imagination, and almost in feeling, nearer to you, your mother, and to my little Horace. I am going to pass all my time in prison in writing to you, for I have no need to take my pen for any other pur pose for my defence. My justification is entirely in my eight Republican volumes. They are a good pillow upon which my conscience reposes in the expectation of the tribunal and of posterity. I cast myself at your knees ; I stretch out my arms to embrace you ; I find you no more. Send me the glass on which are our two names ; a book, which I bought some days ago, on the immortality of the soul. I have need of persuading myself that there is a God more just than man, and that I cannot fail to see you again. Do not grieve too much over my thoughts, dearest; I do not yet despair of men. Yes, my beloved, we will see ourselves again in the garden of Luxembourg. Adieu, Lucile ! Adieu Horace ! I cannot embrace you ; but in the tears which I shed it appears that I press you again to my bosom. \"Thy Camille.\" His wife, Lucile, made frantic efforts to move the heart of Robespierre to pity. Being repulsed when she endeavored to gain access to his presence, she wrote the following appeal : \u2014"], [609, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 523 \" Can you accuse us of treason, you who have profited so much by the efforts we have made for our country ? Camille has seen the birth of your pride, the path you desired to tread, but he has recalled your ancient friend ship, and shrunk from the idea of accusing a friend, a companion of his labors. That hand which has pressed yours has too soon abandoned the pen, since it could no longer trace your praise ; and you, you send him to death. But, Robespierre, will you really accomplish the deadly projects which doubtless the vile souls which surround you have inspired you with ? Have you forgotten those bonds which Camille never recalls without grief? you who prayed for our union, who joined our hands in yours, who have smiled upon my son, whose infantile hands have so often caressed you ? Can you, then, re ject my prayers, despise my tears, and trample justice under foot ? For you know it yourself, we do not merit the fate they are preparing for us, and you can avert it. If it strike us, it is you who have ordered it. But what is, then, the crime of my Camille ? \" I have not his pen to defend him. But the voice of good citizens and your heart, if it is sensible, will plead for me. Do you believe that people will gain confidence in you by seeing you immolate your best friends ? Do you think that they will bless him who regards neither the tears of the widow nor the death of the orphan ? Poor Camille! in the simplicity of his heart, how far was he from suspecting the fate which awaits him to day ! He thought to labor for your glory in pointing out to you what was still wanting to our Republic. He has, no doubt, been calumniated to you, Robespierre, for you cannot believe him guilty. Consider that he has never required the death of any one, that he has never desired to injure your power, and that you were his"], [610, "524 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. oldest and his best friend. And you are about to kill us both ! For to strike him is to kill me.\" This letter of Lucile's was not finished, for she was also soon imprisoned. The trial of the Dantonists lasted three days. Danton made a powerful defence The court and the surrounding streets were crowded while he was speaking. Through the open windows his thun der-tones reached the multitudes without, and many in the streets caught up his words, and they were echoed from one part of Paris to another. These indications of popular sympathy alarmed the Tribunal, and the accused were forbidden to defend themselves further, and were quickly condemned to die. When the Dantonists were reconducted to their dungeons to await their death, Ca mille again took up his pen to write a last farewell to his beloved wife : \u2014 \"I have dreamed,\" he wrote, \"of a Republic which all the world would have adored. I could not have believed that men were so cruel and unjust. I do not dissimulate that I die a victim to my friendship for Danton. I thank my assassins for allowing me to die with Philippeaux. Pardon, my dear love, my true life, which I lost from the moment they separated us. I occupy myself with my memory. I ought much rather to cause you to for get it, my Lucile. I conjure you, do not call to me by your cries. They would rend my heart in the depths of the tomb. Live for our child ; talk to him of me ; you may tell him what he cannot understand, that I should have loved him much. Despite my execution, I believe there is a God. My blood will wash out my sins, the weakness of my humanity ; and whatever I have pos sessed of good, my virtues and my love of liberty, God will recompense it. I shall see you again one day. \" O my Lucile ! sensitive as I was, the death which"], [611, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 525 delivers me from so much crime, is it so great a misfor tune ? Adieu, my life, my soul, my divinity upon earth ! Adieu, Lucile ! my Lucile ! my dear Lucile ! Adieu, Horace ! Annette ! Adele ! Adieu, my father ! I feel the shore of life fly before me. I still see Lucile, my best beloved ! my Lucile ! My bound hands embrace you, and my severed head rests still upon you its dying eyes.\" When Danton was again led within the gloomy corri dors of the prison, he said to those around him, \u2014 \u25a0 \" It was just a year ago that I was instrumental in instituting the Revolutionary Tribunal. I beg pardon of God and men. I intended it as a measure of human ity, to prevent the renewal of the September massacres, and that no man should suffer without trial. I did not mean that it should prove the scourge of humanity. \" They think that they can do without me,\" he contin ued musingly, pressing his hand against his massive brow ; \" they deceive themselves. I was the statesman of Europe. They do not suspect the void which this head leaves. We are sacrificed to the ambition of a few dastardly brigands. But they will not long enjoy the fruit of their villany. I drag Robespierre after me; Robespierre follows me to the grave. \"As to me, I have enjoyed my moments of existence well. I have made plenty of noise upon earth. I have tasted well of life. Let us go to sleep.\" The executioner, Sanson, writes thus in his diary con cerning his execution of the Dantonists : \u2014 \" I had been waiting for a considerable time, when a gendarme came to tell me that I was wanted by Fouquier- Tinville. I found a good many persons in his closet ; and although Fouquier was present, I received the order of execution from the hands of Lescott. He told me that"], [612, "526 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the convicts had rebelled against the Tribunal; that they would probably offer new resistance; that, to prevent any mishap, they would be introduced one by one ; that I should have to seize them immediately and pinion them. Fleuriot added that if the convicts attempted to excite the people on their way to the scaffold, I was to go at a trot and make all haste. He also recommended extreme celerity in the execution itself, observing that the sooner the ' ruffians ' died, the better. \" I then proceeded to one of the salles in the Concier gerie, which was full of gendarmes. They formed two thick ranks. Half an hour elapsed before one of the convicts appeared. This was Chabot. He looked very ill. He was surprised at finding himself alone, and mur mured, ' Where are the others ? ' He was pinioned, and his hair was cut. Bazire was the next to appear. Cha bot rose, and running up to him exclaimed, with tears in his eyes, ' My poor, poor Bazire ! it was I who brought you to this.' Bazire pressed him in his arms, without a word of reproach. \" The two Freys, Delaunay, member of the Convention, the Abb6 d'Espagnac, and Disderiksen were led in after Bazire. After these, Philippeaux, Lacroix, Westermann, and Fabre d'Eglantine. Two turnkeys supported the latter, who was ill. During the toilet, Fabre said he wished to speak to Fouquier. One of my assistants called a clerk, who said this was not possible. Citizen Fabre then became angry, and cried, 'You ought to be satisfied with murdering me, and not steal my property. I publicly protest against the infamy of the members of the Tribunal, who have stolen from me a manuscript comedy, which has nothing to do with the trial.' La croix and Philippeaux were calm. \" Fabre was still speaking when a noise was heard in"], [613, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 527 the passage. We recognized the voice of Citizen Danton. His words came out like a torrent. When the clerk wanted to read his judgment, he exclaimed, 'Away with you and your judgment ! I won't listen to it ! What a farce ! ' he thundered forth ; and all seemed to recoil before him. But when he saw the other convicts, his demeanor changed completely. He assumed a cold, in different air, and calmly walked up to me. He sat down and tore away his collar, saying, ' Do your duty,. Citizen Sanson.' I cut his hair myself. It was thick and hard, like a mane. Meanwhile he went on speaking to his friends : ' This is the beginning of the end ; they'll guil lotine the representatives wholesale. Committees gov erned by a Couthon without legs, and a Robespierre. . . . If I could leave them mine, they might go on for some time. . . . But, no ; France will awake in a cesspool before long.' Shortly after, he exclaimed, 'We have accomplished our task.' \"Citizens Herault de S^chelles and Camille Desmoulins were led in next. The former gave no sign of emotion; the latter spoke of his wife and child in heartrending terms. As soon as he saw us, he was seized with a tre mendous fit of rage. He rushed upon my assistants, and struggled with them like a giant. All his clothes were torn in the scuffle. Fou-r men had to hold him down on a chair. His friends tried to soothe him, Fabre with soft words ; Danton with a tone of authority said, 'Leave these men alone ! What's the use of fighting with the servants of the guillotine ? They are only doing their duty. Do yours.' \"At length everything was ready. Ducray headed the cortige. The members of the Convention and General Westermann occupied the first cart, in which Henri and I sat down also. Four assistants were in the second cart,"], [614, "528 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with the other convicts. The escort was as numerous as that provided for the queen and the Girondins. Danton stood in the first rank behind me ; next to him was Herault de Sechelles ; Fabre, Camille, and Philippeaux were behind. Chabot was the only one who sat down; he had tried to poison himself, and suffered much. Ba zire stood next to him, and spoke to him words of tender friendship. \"As the carter whipped his horses, Danton exclaimed, ' The idiots ! they'll cry, \u2022\" Long live the Republic ! \" In half an hour the Republic will be without a head.' Fabre d'Eglantine was inconsolable about his comedy, which he said was in verse ; upon which Danton laughed, and said to him, 'Verses! you'll have enough of them in a week, and we too.' [Vers in French means ivorms as well as verses]. \"As we reached the quay, Camille Desmoulins became very furious. 'Do you not recognize me?' he cried. 'The Bastile fell at my bidding ! Come to my help, Republi cans ! Do not let them murder us ! ' \" His cries were received with groans. His fury in creased, and we had to threaten to tie him to the side of the cart if he did not remain still. Danton, who clearly saw that the people who surrounded them would not rise to free them, said to Camille, in a strong voice, 'Be quiet, be quiet! Do not hope to soften this vile rabble.' And Lacroix added, 'Be calm; think more of commanding respect than of exciting pity.' \"Passing before a cafi, we saw a citizen seated on a window-sill, who was drawing likenesses of the prisoners. The latter looked at him and murmured, 'David, David!' Danton raised his voice, and cried, ' Is that you, valet ? Go and tell your master how soldiers of liberty can die ! ' Doors; windows, and shutters were closed in Duplay's"], [615, "529 DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. house [where Robespierre lived]. When the prisoners saw the house, they aimed cutting sarcasms at its walls. 'Vile hypocrite!' said Fabre. 'The coward is hiding himself, as he hid on August 10th,' cried Lacroix. Dan ton's voice rose louder than any. His face was purple, and his eyes glistened like burning coals. 'You shall appear in this cart in your turn, Robespierre ! ' he ex claimed; 'and the soul of Danton will howl with joy!' \" Danton was the same to the last : passing from the most violent anger to the greatest calmness ; at times, brutal ; at others, sarcastic ; and always firm. As we came in sight of the scaffold, his color slightly changed. The attention with which I looked at him seemed to displease him, for he elbowed me roughly, saying, ' Have you not a wife and children ? ' I replied that I had. He then resumed with impetuosity : ' So have I. I was thinking of them.' And I heard him murmur, 'My wife, I shall not see you again ! My child, I shall not see you ! ' But a few seconds after he was himself again. \"Delaunay, Chabot, Bazire, and the two Freys, Gus man, Disderiksen, and D'Espagnac died first. When Camille Desmoulins was on the platform he asked me to do him a last favor, which was to take a lock of his hair, and send it to his mother-in-law. He then stepped towards the plank without resistance. Fabre, Lacroix, Westermann, and Philippeaux suffered next. Herault de Sechelles came next and Danton with him, although he was not called. My assistant had already seized S6chelles, when Danton advanced to embrace him. But it was too late. Danton looked on while his friend was being executed, with such coolness as does not belong to man. Not a muscle of his face moved. He seemed to defy not only the fear of death, but death itself. The plank was hardly lowered when he advanced. I"], [616, "530 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. advised him to turn round while the body was being removed. He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and said, ' Do not forget to show my head to the mob ; they have not often seen one like it.' \"When, according to his last wish, Danton's head was shown, there were cries of ' Vive la Ripublique ! ' but not many.\" Thus perished the Dantonists. But blood continued to flow. Even the old executioner, Sanson, is overcome by the ghastly scenes, and thus writes in his diary : \u2014 \" A terrible day's work ! The guillotine devoured fifty-four victims. My strength is at an end, and I almost fainted away. A caricature has been shown to me in which I am represented guillotining myself in the middle of a heath covered with headless bodies and bodiless heads. I do not boast of extraordinary squeam- ishness ; I have seen too much blood in my life not to be callous. If what I feel is not pity, it must be a derangement of my nerves. Perhaps I am punished by the Almighty for my cowardly obedience to mock jus- tice. For some time I have been troubled with terrible visions. I am taken with a fever as soon as I enter the Conciergerie ; it is like fire flowing under my skin. Abstemious as I am, it seems to me as if I were intoxi- cated ; the people who are around me, the furniture, the walls, dance and whirl around me, and my ears are full of strange noises. I struggle against this feeling, but in vain. My hands tremble so that I have been compelled to give up cutting the hair of the doomed prisoners. I follow the preparations for the tragedy, and I dis- charge my functions with the mechanical regularity of an automaton. Then comes the thump of the knife which reminds me of the horrible reality. I cannot hear it now without a shudder. A kind of rage then takes"], [617, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 531 possession of me. Forgetting that I ought to blame myself more than others, I abuse the gendarmes who, sabre in hand, have escorted the victims ; I abuse the people who look on without raising a finger in their defence; I abuse the sun which lightens all this. At length I leave the scaffold, disposed to weep although I cannot find a tear.\" The devoted wife of Camille Desmoulins was not spared. It was her crime that she loved her husband. She possessed dazzling beauty, and was but twenty-three years of age. Her heroism on the scaffold was equal to that of Charlotte Corday and Madame Roland. When she heard her sentence of death, she calmly said to her cruel judges : \u2014 \" I shall then, in a few hours, again meet my husband. In departing from this world I am far less the object of pity than are you.\" Robespierre had been the intimate friend of Camille and Lucile, and was at one time engaged to Adele, the sister of Lucile. When the sentence of death was passed upon the lovely Lucile, her mother, Madame Duplessis, almost frantic with grief, wrote the following appeal to the inhuman Robespierre : \u2014 \"Is it not enough to have assassinated your best friend, Robespierre ? Do you desire also the blood of his wife, of my daughter ? Your master, Fouquier-Tinville, has just ordered her to be led to the scaffold. Two hours more and she will not be in existence. Robespierre, if you are not a tiger in human shape, if the blood of Camille has not inebriated you to the point of losing your reason entirely, if you recall still our evenings of intimacy, if you recall to yourself the caresses you lav ished upon the little Horace, and how you delighted to hold him upon your knees, and if you remember that"], [618, "532 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. you were to have been my son-in-law, spare an innocent victim ! But if thy fury is that of a lion, come and take us also, myself, Adele, and Horace. Come and tear us away with thy hands still reeking in the blood of Camille. Come, come, and let one single tomb reunite us!\" To this affecting letter the monster Robespierre made no reply. As he had turned from Madame Roland, Camille, and Danton, all intimate friends of his in the past, he was now deaf to this anguished cry for pity, and the reeking knife of the red guillotine fell upon the beautiful neck of the fair Lucile. But the keen-edged blade could not rob her of her courage nor of her hope ; and with a smile upon her lips, as though she already beheld her husband's spirit welcome, she laid her grace ful head upon the fatal block. On the 9th of May, at midnight, brutal ruffians entered the cell of Madame Elizabeth and Madame Royale in the Temple, and informed the sister of Louis XVI. that she was summoned before the Revolutionary Tribunal. \" And my niece,\" inquired the anxious aunt ; \" is she to go also ? \" \" We will take care of her by and by,\" answered the commissioners from the Commune. \" We want you alone now.\" Pressing the young princess, Maria Theresa, to her heart for a last farewell, and endeavoring to soothe her fears by words of hope, Madame Elizabeth parted from the young daughter of Louis XVI., and was led to the Conciergerie. The next day she received her death-sentence, and with twenty-two companions, all of noble birth, she perished on the scaffold. And now came Robespierre's final and crowning act of"], [619, "FESTIVAL OF THE SUPREME BEING."], [620, ""], [621, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 533 hypocrisy. With a soul \" as insensible to any generous emotion as was the blade of the guillotine,\" he puts on his last mask in the play of the devil. And so this man, whose heart was a stone, whose hands were red with blood, whose nature was that of a viper, endeavors to cloak his infamous crimes by the assumption of a reli gious enthusiasm. Rising in the Convention, he dares to lift his hypocritical voice in advocating the doctrines of a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. What terrible blasphemy from the defiled lips of such a man ! The 8th of June, 1794, was appointed as the time for celebrating a festival in honor of the Supreme Being. Robespierre was chosen president of the Convention, that he might take the most conspicuous part on that great occasion. The guillotine was ordered to rest from its diabolical work on that one day. In the garden of the Tuileries an amphitheatre was erected. The renowned painter David had arranged the artistic features of the fete. At midday Robespierre ascended a gorgeous pavil ion, which was surrounded by a vast concourse of spec tators, and delivered an address. When this man of blood has dared thus take upon his false lips the name of the great God, he descends from his lofty pedes tal, where he has received the adulation of the fickle populace, and where, in his craven soul, he has wor shipped not the Supreme Being, but only himself, Robespierre; and this arrant dissembler takes a lighted torch, and with great pomp and ceremony sets fire to a colossal group of figures representing Atheism, Discord, and Selfishness, and, puffed up with the pride of his own puny baseness, he retires amidst the applause of the fawning multitude who kiss his polluted hands that peradventure they may thereby save their own heads. Then this high-priest of hypocrisy, having thus offered"], [622, "534 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. incense to his own shrine, lays aside his religious robes and again clothes himself in the garb of a murderer. Fitting time, surely, this year, 1794, for Robespierre to ape sanctity. In no year had the executions been so frightful. In January, 1794, eighty-three were executed ; in February, seventy -five ; in March, one hundred and twenty-three ; in April, two hundred and sixty -three ; in May, three hundred and twenty-four ; and in this month of June, dedicated to the worship of the Supreme Being, six hundred and seventy two had fallen under the knife of the guillotine ; and in July, eight hundred and thirty five. Josephine Beauharnais, afterwards the wife of Napo leon, was at this time imprisoned in one of the dun geons of Paris. Her first husband had been guillotined, and she was daily expecting her death-sentence. The bloody Triumvirate, Robespierre, Saint-Just, and the cripple Couthon, governed the Committee of Public Safety, and commanded the mob of Paris. Taine says of Robespierre : \" Marat and Danton finally being effaced, the stage is left to Robespierre, who ab sorbs attention. \"Robespierre, unlike Danton, has no cravings. He is sober ; he is not tormented by his senses. If he gives way to them, it is only no further than he can help, and with a bad grace. He is naturally steady, hard-working, studious, and fond of seclusion ; at college a model pupil, at home in his province an attentive advocate, a punctual deputy in the Assembly, everywhere free of temptation, and incapable of going astray. ' Irreproachable ' is the word which from early youth an inward voice constantly repeats to him in low tones, to console him for obscurity and patience. Thus he has ever been, is now, and ever will be. He says this to himself, tells others so, and on"], [623, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 535 this foundation, all of a piece, he builds up his char acter. \" He is not, like Desmoulins, to be seduced by dinners ; like Barnave, by flattery ; like Mirabeau and Danton, by money ; like the Girondists, by the insinuating charm of ancient politeness and select society; like the Danton ists, by the bait of joviality and unbounded license, \u2014 he is the incorruptible ; he is the uncompromising champion of right.\" So this arrant hypocrite declares himself, and vaunts his virtues in the face of the world. Priding himself on the deadness of his heart and the numbness of his soul, he becomes the most terrible monster of the Reign of Terror. \" In three years, a chorus of a thousand voices, which he formed and led indefatigably, rehearses to him in stanzas composed by him in his own honor, and which he daily recites to himself in a low tone of voice, and often in a loud one : ' Robespierre alone has discovered the ideal citizen ! Robespierre alone attains to it with out exaggeration or shortcomings ! Robespierre alone is worthy of and able to lead the Revolution ! ' Cool in fatuation carried thus far is equivalent to a raging fever, and Robespierre almost attains the ideas and ravings of Marat. \" His feline physiognomy, \u2014 at first, ' that of a domes tic cat, restless but mild, \u2014 changes into the savage mien of the wild-cat ; and next, to the ferocious mien of the tiger. In the Constituent Assembly he speaks with a whine, in the Convention he froths at the mouth.' The monotonous drone of a stiff sub-professor changes into the personal accent of furious passion ; he hisses and grinds his teeth ; sometimes, on a change of scene, he affects to shed tears. But his wildest outbursts are less"], [624, "536 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. alarming than his affected sensibility. The festering grudges, corrosive envies, and bitter schemings which have accumulated in his breast are astonishing. He never tires of re-executing his guillotined adversaries. Thus, inwardly corroded by the venom it distils, his physical machine gets out of order, like that of Marat, but with other symptoms. When speaking in the tribune, ' his hands twitch with a sort of nervous contraction ' ; sudden tremors agitate ' his shoulders and neck, shaking him convulsively too and fro ' ; ' his bilious complexion becomes livid,' his eyelids quiver under his spectacles, and how he looks ! ' Ah,' said a Montagnard, ' you \u201ewould have voted as we did on the 9th of Thermidor, had you seen his green eyeballs ! ' ' Physically, as well as morally,' he becomes a second Marat, suffering all the more because his delirium is not steady, and because his policy, being a moral one, forces him to exterminate on a grander scale. \"When nature and history combine to produce a character, they succeed better than man's imagination. Neither Moliere in his 'Tartuffe,' nor Shakespeare in his ' Richard III.,' dared bring on the stage a hypocrite believing himself sincere, and a Cain that regarded him self as an Abel. There he stands on a colossal stage, in the presence of a hundred thousand spectators, on the 8th of June, 1794, the most glorious day of his life, at that f&te in honor of the Supreme Being, which is the glorious triumph of his doctrine, and the official conse cration of his popedom.\" * In the. \" Memoirs of a Peer of France \" is to be found the following description of Robespierre in 1794 : \" The reader may figure to himself what I must have felt, when, tete-a-tite with him after the horrors of the 1 Taine."], [625, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 537 day, \u2014 and there was not one but was marked by san guinary executions, \u2014 I was obliged to talk to him about Homer, Tasso, or Rousseau, or to analyze Cicero, Mon taigne, and Rabelais with this man whose hands were stained with blood ! He was fond of novels, and took great delight in the poems of Ossian. From a singular contrast, next to those sombre and melancholy products of the bards of the North, he liked nothing so well as the buffooneries of Scarron. He knew by heart two entire cantos of the burlesque translation of the \u00c6neid ; and I have heard him laugh immoderately while repeat ing the lines in which Scarron refers to the infernal regions. \"But Robespierre's laughter, so far from communi cating any hilarity to me, made me profoundly sad. I fancied that I heard the howling of a tiger ; and even at this day, whenever the recollection of that laugh recurs to my mind, I shudder involuntarily, as if a demon were venting, close to my ear, the bursts of his satanic gayety. Robespierre had habits of excessive delicacy, especially at the period of which I am speaking, and amid the men by whom he was surrounded. He was particular about having his linen very fine and very white. The woman who took care of it was frequently scolded on this ac count ; and I have witnessed some curious scenes between Robespierre and his laundress. He would have his frills plaited with extreme neatness. He wore waistcoats of delicate colors, \u2014 pink, light blue, chamois, \u2014 elegantly embroidered. The dressing of his hair took him a good deal of time ; and he was very particular about the color and cut of his coats. He had two watches, wore several costly rings on his fingers, and had a valuable collection of snuff-boxes. \"His elegant appearance formed a singular contrast"], [626, "538 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. with the studied squalidness of the Jacobins. The populace would have insulted a stranger who should have dressed with such care, and in whom it would have been deemed aristocratic ; but in its favorite, Robespierre, this was considered perfectly republican. From a singu lar contrast, this man, so bold in speech, trembled with fear at the least danger. He did not like to be left alone in the dark. The slightest noise made him shudder, and terror was expressed in his eyes. I had in my room a skull, which I made use of to study anatomy. The sight of it was so disagreeable to Robespierre, that he at length begged me to put it away, and not let him see it any more. I was confounded at such a proof of weak ness.\" One of the most illustrious victims of the Reign of Terror was the celebrated scientist A. L. Lavoisier. In May, 1794, he was condemned by the Revolutionary Tri bunal to death. The only request he made of his judges was to ask that his execution might be delayed a fort night : \" I want so much time,\" he said, \" to terminate some experiments which are indispensable to an impor tant work with which I have been several years occupied. I shall no longer regret my life, which I shall sacrifice to my country.\" The president of the Tribunal replied : \u2014 \" The Republic has no need of scholars and chemists ; the course of justice cannot be suspended.\" Lavoisier ascended the scaffold with a firm step, and died without a murmur. At the top of one accusation was written, \" A head to be chopped off without mercy \" ; and if the identical person could not be immediately found, the brutal agents of the Revolutionary Hades would say to those nearest in name : \" Come, you shall supply his place ; it will be just the same, for it must be your turn sooner or later.\""], [627, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 539 But the end of the awful Reign of Terror was draw ing near. The bloody Triumvirate were in their turn to expiate their culpable fanaticism, or monstrous crimes (according to conflicting authorities) upon the scaffold where hundreds of victims had perished through their instrumentality. Though some historians endeavor to palliate Robespierre's guilt by what they term the plausi ble excuse of necessity, if Robespierre is not an example of monstrous infamy, where among the actors in the atrocious Reign of Terror can be found a greater ? 'Tis true the maniac Marat was a more savage fury ; Danton was a more brutal bull-dog; but Robespierre was the very incarnation of refined cruelty \u2014 heartless as a stone, in flexible as iron, selfish as Satan. Danton was at length moved to plead for clemency ; Marat gloated in blood, but he lived only in his passions, and grovelled like a mad beast wallowing in the gore of his victims ; but Robespierre lived in his intellect, he had not the excuse of unbridled passions to explain his hellish heartless ness. Therefore, by so much as the intellect is above the bestial passions of degraded human nature, by so much does the crime of Robespierre, incited by his intellect, appear blacker than the same crime committed under the frenzied impulse of passion. Robespierre's mind was neither drunk with wine nor passion, he does not even seem moved by the frenzy of fanaticism ; and yet, with the exception of Marat, he was the bloodiest vulture of the Reign of Terror. If Robespierre's position cloaks other men, equally guilty with himself, if he is blamed for atrocious deeds he did not commit with his own hands, he is yet responsi ble that he lifted neither voice nor influence to stay the awful horrors of the Revolutionary Tribunal, nor put forth an effort to stop the river of blood which was"], [628, "540 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. deluging the soil of France, nor gave ear to a single cry for mercy, nor hindered the fall of the reeking knife of the guillotine, even though it was descending upon the neck of his most intimate friends. Let historians excuse him if they can ; let them call him an enigma ! if Robespierre was innocent of blood, \u2014 yes, torrents of blood, and thousands of lives, \u2014 where in history shall we find the guilty ? Prudhomme gives, as victims of the Revolution, the appalling number of 1,022,351 ; which list does not in clude those massacred in the Paris prisons, nor those shot at Toulon or Marseilles. At length the enemies of Robespierre gained courage to avow their hostility. At first it was done secretly. He was flooded with letters, some friends breathing ful some flattery ; others were anonymous, and the pen had been barbed with the poison of intensest hate. \" Thou livest still \" writes one ; \" thou tiger thirsting for the blood of France ! Executioner of thy country ! Thou still survivest ! but thy hour approaches ; this hand, which thy wandering eyes vainly seek to discover, is raised against thee. Every day I am with thee ; every day, at every hour, I seek where to strike thee. Adieu ; this very evening gazing on thee, I will enjoy thy terror ! \" Another writes \" Robespierre ! I see you \u2014 you are looking to the Dictatorship, and you would destroy liberty. You have succeeded in removing the foremost supporters of the Republic. It was thus that Richelieu contrived to reign, by causing the scaffold to flow with blood of all enemies to his plans. You have contrived to get rid of Danton and Lacroix, \u2014 can you avert the blow from my hand, and the hands of twenty-two Brutuses like myself ?"], [629, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 541 Thirty times already I have tried to thrust a poisoned dagger into your heart. I would have shared this glory with others ! You shall perish by the hand you do not suspect, and which presses yours ! \" About this time a young girl, Aimee Cecile Renault, was condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal, accused of trying to assassinate Robespierre. Though this intent could not be proven against her, and she declared that she was only curious to behold Robespierre to see what a tyrant was like, she was sent to the scaffold with all her .family, and sixty other persons whom she did not know, but who were declared to be her accomplices. Robespierre now found that he could no longer carry his measures in the Committee of Public Safety^, and angry and disgusted he absented himself from the meet ings. He found he must either send the Committee to the scaffold or bow his own head beneath the knife. He could still command the mob of Paris, and Henriot, the chief of the military force, was subservient to his will. In the Jacobin Club he reigned supreme. But his foes were nerved with a desperate despair. They could but die, and in attempting his downfall they might perchance save their own necks which sooner or later would fall if he remained in power. Tallien, Barras, and Freron headed the faction against him. This party was called the Thermidorians, because it was in the month of July (Thermidor) that they achieved their victory. Tallien and Freron had more than political animosity against Robespierre. Freron had been an avowed admirer of Lucile Desmoulins, whom Robespierre had sent to the scaffold ; and a lady whom Tallien loved and afterwards married, Madame de Fonte nay, was then a prisoner, by Robespierre's orders, in one"], [630, "542 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. of the Paris prisons ; her two illustrious companions in captivity being Madame d'Aiguillon and Madame Beau harnais, afterwards the Empress Josephine. It was an appeal from his lady-love, to succor her from approach ing death, as she had already been summoned to appear before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which meant always the scaffold, which roused Tallien into a frenzy of hatred against Robespierre and nerved him to his daring attack upon him in the Convention, which turned the tide of opposition with increased force in denunciation of the tyrant and led to Robespierre's accusation. Saint-Just, Robespierre's associate in power, though young in years, possessed, according to Lamartine's opinion, the consummate maturity of a statesman. \" He was born a tyrant. His language assumed the form of a command. He was as laconic as his will. His missions in the camps, and the imperious use which he had made of his authority over the generals in the midst of their armies, had taught Saint-Just how easily men are made to submit under the hand of a single man. His bravery and fiery manner had given him the attitude of a military tribune, as ready to execute as to conceive a coup-de-main. Robespierre was the only man before whom Saint-Just bowed \u2014 as before the superior and regulating idea of the Republic. Even though accusing his delay, he respected his irresolution, and devoted himself to him in his fall. To fall with Robespierre appeared to him to fall with the very cause of the Revolution. An impatient disciple, but still always a disciple, he urged the oracle ; he did not force it.\" Robespierre had prepared a very elaborate speech to be delivered in the Convention. On the morning of the 26th of July, dressed with consummate care, \u2014 for Robes pierre assumed the airs of a dandy in his dress, \u2014 he"], [631, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 543 ascended the tribune and read his carefully prepared document. At its close, for a moment his foes were paralyzed with fear and astonishment, and his friends voted that the speech be printed. But soon one bold voice declared, \" One single man paralyzes the National Convention, and that man is Robespierre.\" Others now took up the cry of opposition. Robespierre was amazed at their audacity. But once roused, his foes were fear less. They voted by a large majority to revoke the resolution to print his speech. Robespierre, mute with alarm, left the Convention and repaired to the Jacobin Club, read to them his discarded speech, and fell fainting with exhaustion and disappointment. The night was passed by both parties in preparing for the decisive strife. On the morning of the 27th, Robes- pierre entered the Convention, and Saint-Just commenced the attack in his behalf. \" Saint-Just's- sonorous voice being now audible from the tribune, the game of games is begun. Saint-Just is verily reading that report of his ; green Vengeance, in the shape of Robespierre, watching nigh. Behold, however, Saint-Just has read but few sentences, when interruption rises, rapid crescendo ; when Tallien starts to his feet, and Billaud, and this man starts, and that ; and Tallien, a second time, with his ' Cito- yens, at the Jacobins last night I trembled for the Republic. I said to myself, if the Convention dare not strike the Tyrant, then I myself dare ; and with this I will do it, if need be,' said he, whisking out a clear- gleaming dagger, and brandishing it there, \u2014 the Steel of Brutus, as we call it. Whereat we all bellow, and brand ish, impetuous acclaim. 'Tyranny! Dictatorship! Trium virate ! ' And the Saint Committee-men accuse, and all men accuse, and uproar, and impetuously acclaim. And Saint-Just is standing motionless, pale of face ; Couthon"], [632, "544 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ejaculating, ('Triumvir!') with a look at his paralytic legs. And Robespierre is struggling to speak, but Presi dent Thuriot is jingling the bell against him, but the Hall is sounding against him like an \u00c6olus-Hall ; and Robes pierre is mounting the Tribune-steps, and descending again; going and coming, like to choke with rage, terror, desperation ; and mutiny is the order of the day.\" ' In the midst of the terrible conflict which followed, when Robespierre seemed deprived of the power of artic ulation, so great was his rage and excitement, a voice cried out, \"It is Danton's blood that is choking you!\" Robespierre indignantly exclaimed : \"Danton! Is it then Danton you regret ? Cowards ! why did you not defend him?\" In the midst of the uproar, Louchet moved the arrest of Robespierre ; and Tallien also moved that Henriot and other leading men of that party should be arrested. As these propositions were received with thunders of ap plause, Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon, and Lebas, together with Robespierre's younger brother (who had voluntarily surrendered himself, saying, \" I am as guilty as my brother ; I have shared his virtues, I wish to share his fate\"), were led by gendarmes from the Convention to the Committee of General Safely. After a brief exam ination, Robespierre was sent to the Luxembourg, while his companions were distributed amongst the other pris ons of Paris. The mayor of Paris and Henriot endeavored to excite the mob to rise and rescue the prisoners. Flour ishing a pistol, Henriot mounted his horse, though he was in a beastly state of intoxication, and followed by a small detachment of troops, he galloped to the Luxem bourg to rescue Robespierre. On the way he was met by troops of the Convention, who had been ordered to arrest 1 Carlyle."], [633, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 545 him. They dragged him from his horse and shut him up in a guard-house. Meanwhile, the mob had broken into the prisons and rescued Robespierre and his friends. The populace then released Henriot, who was by this time somewhat recovered from his drunken fit. Henriot again headed his troops and marched against the Con vention. The members were in great danger, as Henriot had placed cannon before the door of the Convention Hall. But Barras, who had already superseded Henriot in command of the National Guard, rallied the citizens in defence of the Convention, and with his bands of well ordered men he drove back the mob led by Henriot, aud cleared the approaches to the H6tel de Ville. Robespierre and his confederates were in one of the apartments of the H6tel de Ville. Robespierre was urged by his friends to incite the mob to insurrection, but he refused, declaring that he would rather die. A detachment of soldiers then entered the room, and seeing them, Lebas fired a pistol at his own head and fell dead. The younger Robespierre leaped from the window, breaking his leg by the fall. Coffinhal, enraged at the ruin in which the drunken imbecility of Henriot had involved them, seized upon him and threw him out of the window, upon a pile of rubbish in the midst of a muddy gutter, exclaiming : \" Lie there, wretched drunkard ! You are not worthy to die on a scaffold ! \" Robespierre was sitting at a table, and one of the gen darmes discharged a pistol at him; though some assert that Robespierre himself fired the shot, hoping to escape the guillotine by suicide. Whether the ball was sent by the hand of the soldier or by Robespierre, it entered the cheek, fracturing the jaw, and leaving Robespierre horri bly mutilated. The troops of the Convention now filled the Hotel de"], [634, "546 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Ville, and the early dawn was just breaking as the wounded prisoners were led and carried to the Tuileries. Robespierre was borne on a litter by four men. The paralytic Couthon, was carried on the shoulders of men, who had carelessly allowed him to fall from their hands on the way, smearing him with mud. Robespierre the younger, fainting from the agony caused by his mangled limb, was conveyed in the arms of two men. The bleed ing body of Henriot had been lifted from the gutter, and the wretch, still alive, was followed by the corpse of Lebas. Saint-Just came next with bound hands and pale countenance, followed by eighty members of the city government, bound two and two. Robespierre was laid upon a table in an ante-room, and for long hours he was left in the intense heat of the morning, lying there, surrounded by a mocking mass of people, overwhelming him with curses and insults. The blood was still flowing from his wounded jaw, and he feigned death, that thus he might be spared some of the reproaches of the crowd. Meanwhile, Legendre had marched to the assembly room of the Jacobins, and dispersed them, locking the door and bringing the keys to the president of the Con vention. At three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoners were taken before the Revolutionary Tribunal. Their sentence of death was quickly passed. At five o'clock the carts of the condemned received the prisoners. Even the corpse of Lebas was carried to the scaffold to be guillotined. In the same cart with this corpse was Robespierre, his brother, Henriot, and Couthon, \u2014 all mangled, bleeding, and moaning with pain. As the cart jolted over the rough pavements, the prisoners shrieked with anguish. The mob stopped the cart containing Robespierre before"], [635, "DANTON AND ROBESPIERRE. 547 his late residence. Some of the frenzied people had smeared the walls of his house with blood; and as a band of women were dancing with shouts of laughter around the cart, one of them cried: \"Thy execution intoxicates me with joy! Descend to hell, with the curses of all wives and of all mothers!\" When Robespierre stood on the scaffold, the execu tioner, when about to bind him to the plank, tore away the bandage from his bleeding jaw, and so great was his agony that he shrieked with pain. He was exe cuted at the age of thirty-five. The following epitaph was written for him : \" Passer-by, lament not his fate ; for, were he living, thou wouldst be dead.\" In December of this same year, the infamous Carrier was condemned and executed. On the scaffold he had the daring effrontery to say : \" I die a victim and inno cent; I have only executed the orders of the Committees.\" It would surely seem as though no place was deep enough in the profoundest abysses of the Inferno for such a hellish monster of crime. In May, 1795, Fouquier-Tinville and fifteen jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal were executed; and in the same month the Revolutionary Tribunal was sup pressed. Many of the young men of Paris, appalled at the horrors of the past scenes, had organized themselves into a band, called the Jeunesse Dor&e, or Gilded Youth, and commenced a vigorous opposition to the Jacobins. The Terrorists having become unpopular, the guillotine was at length allowed to rest. The captives who crowded the prisons of Paris were liberated, and the Jeunesse Dorie were usually victorious in their conflicts with their op- posers. The Convention at length passed a decree to close the"], [636, "548 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Club of the Jacobins, and this act was greeted with de light by the French people.

ENGLAND and Russia were the most declared foes of the Revolution. Russia was busy in her attempt to vanquish Poland, so that England found herself com paratively alone in active measures against France ; as Prussia took Pitt's money, but attempted nothing ; and Spain, fearing being duped by her allies, refused to act ; while Holland, Piedmont, and Austria were getting weary of continual defeats. Still Pitt lavished his gold and genius to rekindle enthusiasm in a war which should save the aristocracy of England and give her the coveted empire of the sea. Despite the remonstrances of Fox and Sheridan, Pitt obtained from the English Parliament all he demanded. But notwithstanding Pitt's untiring energy, France rose to the conflict with all her resources, and employed her entire population and wealth to combat her enemies. Five hundred thousand Frenchmen had already been armed. The manufactories had turned out a million of muskets, and the founderies were prepared to east seven thousand cannon per year. Twelve million pounds of saltpetre had been extracted from the soil. The navy had been recruited from Brittany and Normandy. Sixty vessels were cruising along the coast, and French privateers had taken more than four hundred merchant crafts from the English. The army of the North, under Pichegru, was a hundred and sixty thousand strong. Such was the military position of France in the beginning of 1794. Let us take a rapid survey of the defeats and victories"], [639, "THE CONVENTION. 551 of France from this time down to the overthrow of the Directory. In June, 1794, General Pichegru defeated General Clairfait of the Allies at Ypres, and in the same month the French General Jourdan invested Charleroi and forced it to surrender, and he then defeated the Prince of Saxe-Coburg on the heights of Fleurus. The Duke of York and the Prince of Saxe-Coburg having been defeated at all points, retired behind the Dyle ; while Pichegru defeated the English at Antwerp in July ; and Jourdan, in the same month, was victorious over the Austrians at Louvain, and compelled them to recross the Meuse. On the Moselle and Rhine, where sixty thousand French were facing seventy thousand Prussians, the military movements were not important. The French armies of the Alps and Italy made themselves masters of all the higher chains of the Maritime Alps by following the plan of young Bonaparte, who commanded the artil lery. In the Eastern Pyrenees, Dugommier had beaten the Spaniards again and again. But these achievements were counterbalanced by reverses at sea. \"In Corsica the French troops still struggled against the forces of Paoli, but they were blockaded by the English fleet, which had abandoned Toulon, and compelled to surrender.\" But these victori ous English had themselves been obliged to evacuate Toulon the year before, having been conquered by the breaching batteries which .the young Napoleon had so successfully employed in the siege of the town. The French suffered other reverses than their defeat in Corsica. \"The French colonies in India were lost with scarcely a blow. Guadaloupe was lost, retaken, and lost again.

St. Domingo was the theatre of a most cruel strife between the whites and blacks ; and a terrible bat tle between the English admiral Howe and the French admiral Villaret-Joyeuse, near Brest, on the French coast, completed the naval disasters of the French.\" The distress in France increased. The insurrections in La Vendee were not entirely quelled. The assignats had fallen to a sixth of their value, for their issue could hardly be limited with fourteen standing armies to feed and provide for. Industry and commerce, save only those which ministered to the requirements of war, were paralyzed. The Maximum laws had been power less to arrest the scarcity of corn. Then came the fall of Robespierre and his party. \" The Revolution had reached the term of its interior elaboration ; a new era was opening for it. Constituted from its origin to secure the emancipation of France, it was no longer content with this mission. It had acted on the defensive against old-fashioned Europe, but it intended now to take the offensive ; from resistance it had passed to conquest. Hitherto men of words had occupied the foremost places ; henceforth they would have to vacate the place for men of action who were spreading their creed at the point of the sword.\" 1 In France, too, great changes occurred. The Conven tion decreed that the Committee of Public Salvation should merely have the direction of diplomatic and mili tary affairs. The law of the 22d Prairial, against sus pected persons, was repealed; the power of the Revolu tionary Committees was diminished ; the Revolutionary Tribunal was reorganized, and its judges and jury changed; the Commune was abolished, and the admin istration of the affairs of Paris was entrusted to commit- 1 Van Laun."], [641, "THE CONVENTION. 553 tees of police and finance, selected by the Convention and subject to the Committees of Salvation and Safety. The price of provisions was lessened, and the govern ment was limited in demands for men and money. Commissioners were sent into the provinces to repress the Terrorists and release the suspected from imprison ment, and eight days later there was not a suspected person left in the ten prisons which had hitherto been crowded. The Convention endeavored to reinstate industry and order by several useful measures. Public works were projected ; the Normal and other schools were opened, the Academy was reorganized, and the Conservatoire of Arts and Trades and the Museum were established. The Revolution was asserting itself abroad by frequent victories. \" In Holland, the English were beaten on all sides, the Duke of York being compelled to take up a position behind the Waal. The French soldiers, starv ing and scarcely clothed, were nevertheless everywhere victorious, forcing the Dutch Stadtholder to abdicate, and penetrating finally as far as Amsterdam (19th Janu ary, 1795). The Dutch, though invaded, beheld with wonder ten battalions of Frenchmen, shoeless, stocking less, destitute of the most indispensable clothing, forced to hide their nakedness with garments made of straw, enter triumphantly within their walls to the sound of warlike strains, and then, quietly stacking their arms, bivouac patiently in the public squares, amidst ice and snow, until food, raiment, and shelter could be provided for them.\" 1 In the Eastern Pyrenees success crowned the French arms, and Hoche suppressed the rebels in Brittany.

Several of the Allies now sought excuses for withdrawing from the coalition. The Grand Duke of Tuscany was the first to treat with France. Then followed the United Provinces, and later, Spain and Prussia. Saxony, the two Hesses, and Hanover joined Prussia in her neutrality; the German Diet demanded peace of the Emperor ; and Portugal confessed that it had joined the coalition at the instigation of England ; while Naples craved mercy at the hands of the Republic ; and the Duke of Parma and the Pope declared that they had never evinced enmity towards France. Thus Revolution ary France was acknowledged, and England and Austria were its only open foes. \"Pitt had miscalculated the strength of the Revolution, as Lord Malmesbury found to his cost, when the French government, instead of accepting the humiliating terms of which he was the bearer, ordered him to leave Paris within four-and twenty hours \u2014 a double insult to the prime minister, who did not wish for peace, and who made war by ever employing the same unsuccessful means, \u2014 a blind lavish ing of money.

Meanwhile the Convention was nearing its end. It had been laboring with a new constitution which, it was hoped, would meet the emergencies of the country, as that of 1793 was acknowledged to be impracticable. This constitution was the work of the moderate Repub lican party, and so was obnoxious to the Royalists and the Jacobins ; for there were still Royalists and Jaco bins. No longer, forsooth, the Royalist \"Aristocracy of Feudal Parchment,\" which has passed away \"with a mighty rushing \" ; but now, \" by a natural course, we arrive at Aristocracy of the Moneybag.\" For the \"con fused wreck of a Republic of the Poverties, which ended in the Reign of Terror, is arranging itself into such com posure as it can.

According to this Constitution, the new Legislative Assembly should con sist of two Councils : one called the Council of the Five Hundred ; the other, the Council of the Ancients. Five directors were entrusted with the executive power, whose measures were to be sanctioned or annulled by the An cients and Five Hundred. Both Royalists and Jacobins now combined to crush this Constitution so obnoxious in their opinion. The Jacobins cried, \"We want bread, and the Constitution of 1793 ! \" Drunken men and women rushed in crowds to the hall of the Convention, and a fierce battle raged around the doors. Some of the citizens rallied for the defence of the Convention. Shots were fired, yells and imprecations resounded in the hall and corridors ; and a young deputy, Feraud, was stabbed, then shot, and his head was cut off and lifted on a pike before the face of the president of the Convention. For six hours the tumult continued, until a detachment of the National Guards dispersed the mob. The Duchesse d'Abrantfes, who was then in Paris, says: \"While the most frightful scenes were passing in the Convention, the respectable inhabitants of Paris shut themselves up in their houses, concealed their valuables, and awaited with fearful anxiety the result. Toward evening my brother came home to get something to eat. He had scarcely finished his hasty repast, when General"], [645, "THE CONVENTION. 557 Bonaparte arrived, to make a similar claim upon our hospitality. As he was eating, he told us the news of the day. It was appalling ; my brother had informed us but of part. He did not know of the assassination of the unfortunate Feraud, whose body had been cut almost piecemeal. < They took his head,' said Bonaparte, 'and presented it to poor Boissy d'Anglas, and the shock of this fiend-like act was almost death to the president in his chair. Truly,' added he, ' if we continue thus to sully our Revolution, it will be a disgrace to be a French man.' \" But this was not the last rebellion against the Con vention. The Royalists and Jacobins united in a Pari sian mob. The section Lepelletier was the starting-place of the riot. The Convention despatched General Menou with troops to dispel the mob in that section. General Menou indeed inarched, but with poor result. Either through fear, or error of judgment, Menou parleyed with the leaders, instead of pelting them with shot. He returned quaking to the Convention, to be arrested as a traitor ; and jubilant section Lepelletier is thereupon joined by thousands more of insurgents, and they pre pare to take the Convention by storm. Deputies, with pale faces and pallid lips, ask each other, \" What shall we do ? \" The president, wearied with arduous consti tution-making, hopelessly echoes, \" What shall we do ? \" Some call for Barras to be made commandant, as he had before displayed intrejuid energy in Thermidor ; he would seem the man for the hour. But \" what is more to the purpose, others bethink them of Citizen Bona parte, unemployed artillery officer, who took Toulon.\" Surely a wise thought, this ; but who is Bonaparte ?

Thus it was not liberty that it had to proclaim in presence of an enfeebled and despised throne ; it was liberty that it had to defend against all Europe \u2014 a very difficult task. Without be ing for a moment daunted, it proclaimed the Republic in the face of hostile armies ; it then sacrificed the king, to cut off all retreat from itself ; it subsequently took all the powers into its own hands, and constituted itself a dictatorship. Voices were raised in its bosom which talked of humanity, when it wished to hear of nothing but energy; it stifled them. This dictatorship, which the necessity of the general preservation had obliged it 1 Carlyle."], [648, "560 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. to arrogate to itself over all France, twelve of its mem bers soon arrogated to themselves over it, for the same reason, and on account of the same necessity. From the Alps to the sea, from the Pyrenees to the Rhine, these twelve dictators seized upon all, both men and things, and commenced the greatest and the most awful struggle with the nations of Europe ever recorded in history. They spilt torrents of blood, till, having become useless from victory and odious by the abuse of power, they fell. \" The Convention then took the dictatorship again into its own hands, and began, by degrees, to relax the springs of that terrible administration. Rendered con fident by victory, it listened to humanity, and indulged its spirit of regeneration. It aimed at everything good and great, and pursued this purpose for a year ; but the parties crushed under its pitiless authority revived under its clemency. Two factions, in which were blended, under infinite variety of shades, the friends and the foes of the Revolution, attacked it by turns. It vanquished the one and the other, and, till the last day, showed itself heroic amid dangers. Lastly, it framed a Republican Constitution, and, after a struggle of three years with Europe, with the factions, with itself ; mutilated and bleeding, it dissolved itself, and transmitted the govern ment of France to the Directory.\" The Revolution may be said to have now been brought to a close. But the momentous events of the next four years, including the overthroAv of the Directory, foreign wars, and revolution of the 18th Brumaire, are so inti mately connected with, and consequent upon, the pre ceding revolution, that a brief outline of the most im portant incidents is here concisely sketched. The Directory now began its history. The two Councils \u2014 that of the Ancients and Five Hundred"], [649, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 561 assembled in the Tuileries and Riding School, elected five Directors. They were Lareveillere-Lepeaux, Rew bell, Letourneur, Carnot, and Barras. \"Among these,\" says Thiers, \" there was not a man of genius, nor even any man of high reputation, excepting Carnot.\" Several salu tary decrees were passed ; and the return of specie cur rency, effected by the Directory, brought back to France a measure of order and prosperity. The Directory ex changed the princess, Madame Royale, daughter of Louis XVI., who until this time had languished in prison, for some French commissioners, held as hostages by the Austrians. An army of the interior was organized, and Napoleon was placed in command. Pitt still clamored for war against the French Republic. Fox and Sheridan opposed him in Parliament, and denounced the war measures of the ministry. Pitt endeavored to defend himself by saying \" that English blood had not been shed.\" \" True,\" replied Sheridan. \" English blood has not been shed ; but English honor has oozed from every pore.\" The Directory, hating the Royalists, and fearing the Jacobins, continued the plan of \" political see-saw \" em ployed by the Convention. Carnot had formed a plan for the campaign of 1796 ; and three young generals were entrusted with its execu tion, \u2014 Jourdan, commanding the army of the Sambre and Meuse ; Moreau, that of the Rhine and the Moselle ; and Napoleon, that of Italy. The Allies numbered sixty five thousand in all. Five-and-twenty thousand Pied montese were stationed from the Stura to the Bormida, by way of Ceva. Fifteen thousand Austrians occupied the banks of the Bormida, and twenty-five thousand Austrians were in the passes of the Bochetta. During the first five months of 1796 occurred the"], [650, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 562 battles of Montenotte, Millesimo, Mondovi, and Bridge of Lodi. Thus the French, almost at one blow, had become masters of Pavia, Cremona, and of Milan. Na poleon had granted an armistice to the Duke of Parma, who had to pay two millions of francs, furnish several thousand horses and large quantities of grain, and send twenty paintings to the Museum in Paris. Bonaparte concluded a similar treaty with the Duke of Modena ; and in Lombardy he levied a contribution of twenty millions of francs, \u2014 sending ten to the Di rectory, and on-e to Moreau, to provide for his division of the army. The Directory, amazed at these feats of military skill, became jealous of Napoleon, and attempted to compel Bonaparte to change his plans. But he immediately tendered his resignation, which they dared not accept. In June, the battle of Altenkirchen was gained by Jourdan, and Napoleon granted an armistice to the Pope. The battle of Ettingen was gained by Moreau in July ; and in August occurred the victory of Castiglione. In this last campaign of six days, thirty thousand men had conquered double their number ; and had killed and taken twenty thousand troops, and captured sixty guns and twenty standards. In September Napoleon defeated the Austrians under Wurmser, at Bassano ; and Bonaparte pursued the Aus trian general and again vanquished him at Fort St. George, and compelled him to shut himself in the town of Mantua. In October the battle of Biberach was gained by Moreau, and Spain declared war against Eng land, and the Directory concluded a treaty of peace with the king of the Two Sicilies.

Joubert had conquered the Austrians on the Lavis, at Neumarkt, and at Clausen. Meanwhile the Venetian Senate concluded a secret treaty with Austria, to cut off Bonaparte's retreat. Napoleon thereupon threatened the Senate with destruction, should they attempt such an 1 Van Laun."], [652, "564 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. attack ; and pushing forward, he defeated the Archduke in the passes of Neumarkt, crossed the Alps again, and joined Joubert at Leoben. The Austrian court, terror stricken, requested an armistice, which Napoleon granted. Just at this time Hoche defeated the Austrians at Hulsendorf ; Moreau crossed the Rhine at Diersheim, beat the Austrians, and penetrated into the Black Forest. But the armistice prevented further progress. The Directory ratified the preliminaries of Leoben ; and Bonaparte en tered Venice, and established a democratic government there. He also forced the Senate of Genoa to abdicate ; and under the title of the Ligurian Republic, Genoa became the ally of France. These events filled Europe with astonishment, and sent terror into the hearts of the enemies of the French Revolution. Pitt was at length forced to yield to the demand of the English people, who were aghast at the victories of France, and peace was proposed, which was accepted by the Directory ; but these negotiations were broken off later. But at this time France was divided by internal fac tions. The finances were at the lowest ebb, and the gov ernment was forced to borrow money at ruinous interest. The refractory priests preached civil war and disorder openly and unrebuked. The Royalists planned the indict ment of the Directory, the reorganization of the National Guards, and the reinstating of Louis XVIII. on the throne, by the Councils. The Directory was mistrusted, was divided against itself, and powerless to dissolve the Councils. \" The French Republic was in a state of in dignation, because it had vanquished Europe for the sake of crushing Royalism, and this very Royalism was now proudly rearing its head in the midst of France.\"1 1 Van Laun."], [653, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 565 \" It was the dread of the counter-revolution which in 1793 had thrown the Republic into the excesses and frenzy, the sad history of which we have recorded. It was the dread of the counter-revolution which to-day obliged it to throw itself into the arms of the military.\"1 Bonaparte counselled the Directory to attempt a coup d'itat, and offered his troops to support it. Moreau, envious of Napoleon, sided with the Royalists. For five months the guilty secret of Pichegru's treason had been known to him through some papers taken from an Austrian baggage-wagon. Hoche's attachment to the Republic was undoubted. The Directory had already come to an understanding with Hoche, to bring fifteen thousand troops to a certain distance from Paris in case of need; but the Councils objected, and proposed to substitute Augereau for Hoche, and to him the Directory gave the command of Paris. The Royalists had succeeded in placing Barthelemy in the Directory in place of Letourneur, to whose lot it had fallen to retire from that position ; and Carnot had, through the influence of his wife and others, refused to take active measures with the Republican Directors. Thus three of the Directors were in opposition to Carnot and Barthelemy. At midnight, on the 18th Fructidor (September 4th), twelve thousand soldiers, with forty pieces of cannon, were secretly marched into Paris, and surrounded the Tuileries. These troops were to protect the Directory. Pichegru, who had been leagued with the Royalists, marched on the Directory at the head of the Legislative Guard. But the twelve thousand men and forty cannon proved a sufficient defence, as their number and strength convinced the Royalists of the hopelessness of their at- i Thiers."], [654, "566 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. tempt, and the Legislative Guard surrendered without a struggle, and in one night a bloodless revolution was ac complished. The three victorious Directors, condemned to banishment their two colleagues, Carnot and Barthi lemy, together with forty-two members of the Council of Five Hundred, eleven of the Council of Ancients, several Royalist agents, and forty-two editors, publishers, and proprietors of counter-revolutionary journals. Napoleon was much displeased at this excessive sever ity of the Directory. \"It might have been right,\" he wrote, \" to deprive Carnot, Barthelemy, and the fifty deputies of their appointments, and put them under sur veillance in some cities in the interior. Pichegru, Willot, Imbert, Colonne, and one or two others might justly have expiated their treason on the scaffold. But to see men of great talent, such as Portalis, Ducoudray, Fon tanes ; tried patriots, such as Boissy d'Anglas, Dumolard, Murinais ; supreme magistrates, such as Carnot and Barthelemy, condemned without either trial or accusa tion, is frightful. What! to punish with transportation a number of writers of pamphlets, who deserved only contempt and a trifling correction, was to renew the pro scriptions of the Roman Triumvirs. It was to act more cruelly than Fouquier-Tinville ; since he, at least, put the accused on their trial, and condemned them only to death. All the armies, all the people, were for a Repub lic. State necessity could not be alleged in favor of so revolting an injustice, so flagrant a violation of the laws and the rights of the citizens.\"1 In order to justify its severe measures, the Directory published the treasonable documents of Pichegru, for warded by Moreau ; but this tardy act of Moreau did not save him from being deposed and replaced by Hoche ; 1 Me'moires de Napole'on."], [655, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 567 who, however, lived but a few days, being poisoned, it is reported, by his enemies. Thus terminated the 18th Fructidor, compelling the Royalists to a silence which lasted for seventeen years. \" The saving of the Revolution by extra-legal means had undone the Constitution, and thrown the military power into relief, by showing the value of its aid. It was not surprising that henceforth it should arrogate to itself a supreme position, and endeavor to assume the conduct and government of the country.\" Thus comments Henri Van Laun, in his \" French Revolutionary Epoch.\" . On the 17th of October the famous treaty of Campo- Formio was signed. This secured many glorious advan tages to France, and among other clauses, provided for the deliverance of La Fayette and his fellow-prisoners. The dazzling victories of the Army of Italy covered Bonaparte with glory, and he became the idol of France. On the 10th of December General Bonaparte was ten dered a magnificent reception by the Directory in Paris. The ceremonies of the occasion were more imposing than any celebrated since the Champ-de-Mars Fetes. The laconic address of Napoleon to the Directory was as follows : \u2014 \" The French people in order to be free had kings to combat.

Peace secures the liberty, the prosperity, and the glory of the Republic. When the happiness of the French people shall be seated on better organic laivs, all Europe will become free.\" The grandeur of France was but of short duration. The Directory was unable to maintain it. \" Pitt was in triguing for a new coalition ; Naples felt indignant at the overthrow of the Pope, and the Republic lodged at its very gates ; Austria was making considerable arma ments ; nor did the Rastadt Congress seem disposed to abandon the left bank of the Rhine, or to overturn the Germanic Constitution by abolishing the three ecclesias tical electorates. Finally, the five republics established by France on her frontiers were torn by internal anarchy and impotence ; their creation had been a source of alarm to the crowned heads of Europe, and their very existence proved that they were but so many annexes of France under another name. Holland was in a similar plight. The Cisalpine Republic was already endeavoring to throw off the French yoke ; Rome was pillaged by the agents of the Directory and by Massena, while the troops endured the greatest misery. The soldiers revolted against their general, and the populace against the French; the Roman insurgents were vanquished, but the army compelled Masseha to resign. Some of the Swiss cantons refused to adopt the Constitution ; others, dissatisfied, demanded the support of Austria, while the agents of the Direc-"], [657, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 569 tory imposed the most burdensome requisitions upon them.\" l On the 19th of May, 1798, Bonaparte sailed from Tou lon with his Egyptian expedition. On the 10th of June the Island of Malta was taken by Napoleon, and on July 1st he landed in Egypt. On the 21st of July occurred the battle of the Pyramids, but on August 1st and 2d the French lost in the sea-fight at Aboukir, known as the battle of the Nile, the advantage they had gained in Egypt. In September the Porte declared war against France, and in October occurred the insurrection at Cairo. The victory of the English under Nelson over the French in the battle of the Nile encouraged the foes of the Republic in Europe to renewed opposition. In December, 1793, the Battle of Civita-Castellana was fought, in which forty thousand Neapolitans, under the Austrian general Mack, were defeated by six thousand Frenchmen. In the same month occurred the ratifica tion of the treaty between the French and Helvetic Republics ; and war was declared against the kings of Naples and Sardinia. The king of Sardinia ceded Pied mont to France, General Joubert entered Turin, and the French, under Championnet, reoccupied Rome. In the latter part of this year a treaty of alliance was formed between England and Russia against France, and the campaign of 1799 opened by hostile measures on all sides. In January Naples was taken by Championnet, and in March there were hostile movements by the French and Austrian armies on the Rhine. The country of the Grisons was conquered by the French under Massena, and Coire was taken by General Hotze. In the begin- 1 Van Laun."], [658, "570 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. ning of this campaign the hostile hosts were in the fol lowing positions : \u2014 \" Seventy thousand troops, under the Archduke Charles, occupied Bavaria ; General Hotze occupied the Vorarlberg with five-and-twenty thousand men ; Bellegarde was with forty-five thousand in the Tyrol ; and seventy thousand guarded the line of the Adige, headed by Marshal Kray. Eighty thousand Russians, in two equal divisions, were on their way to join the Austrians. The division under Suvarof was to operate with Kray, that one under Kor sakoff with the Archduke. Finally, forty thousand Eng lish and Sicilians in Naples. \" The Directory, instead of concentrating its forces on the Adige and near the sources of the Danube, divided them. Fifteen thousand troops were posted in Holland, under Brune ; eight thousand at Mayence, under Ber nadotte; forty thousand from Strasburg to Bale, under Jourdan ; thirty thousand in Switzerland, under Mas sena; fifty thousand on the Adige, under Scherer; thirty thousand at Naples, under Macdonald, who had succeeded Chamjiionnet.\" 1 On March 25th the French were defeated at Stockach, and in April they met with another defeat at Cassano. In this same month the French commissioners who had been sent to the Con gress of Rastadt were ordered by the German princes to depart immediately, and a safe-conduct was refused them. About fifty yards from the town they were stopped by some Austrian hussars, and assailed with swords, and two of the commissioners were killed and one severely wounded. This dastardly outrage aroused the indignation of the Directory and the French nation, and conscription lists were immediately filled, and re enforcements were sent to all the French armies. Dur- 1 Van Laun."], [659, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 571 ing the winter of 1798 Bonaparte had consolidated his victories in Egypt by fortifying his positions, encourag ing scientific explorations, and recruiting his army from the remains of the French fleet, supplemented by natives. In March, 1799, Napoleon made an expedition to Syria, and captured Jaffa. General KMber, finding himself surrounded by the Turks, near Mount Tabor, made a gallant defence, and Bonaparte coming to his rescue, the Turkish cohorts were routed. Meanwhile Napoleon was besieging Acre. Having made an assault into the very town, the victory was found to be useless, as nearly all the French officers were killed, and the French sol diers were stricken with the plague. The only alterna tive left, therefore, was to raise the siege. Bonaparte then proceeded to Aboukir, where an army of eighteen thousand Turks had entrenched themselves. Napoleon stormed the place, drove the defenders into the sea. Twelve thousand Turks were drowned, three thousand died on the field, and three thousand were taken pris oners. Thus the entire Turkish army was wiped out of existence, and the French were once more masters of Egypt. This victory of Aboukir was in July, and we must glance once more at France before recounting the return of Napoleon from Egypt. In May, 1799, the citadel of Milan was taken by Suvarof, and in June Zurich was captured by the Archduke Charles. But these foreign defeats were not the only disasters of the French. On June 17th and 18th occurred the events of the 30th Prairial, which resulted in the turning out of three of the Directors by the Legislative Body. Henri Van Laun says, regarding this event : \u2014 \"A universal cry arose against the government, ac cused of having ruined the country's magnificent posi-"], [660, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 572 tion by provoking war, and sending Bonaparte into exile with his thirty thousand soldiers, as well as of having brought on these disasters by its incapacity, ignorance, and bad faith. In vain the Directory endeavored to re vive the enthusiasm of 1793. The nation, weary of the sacrifices of the last ten years, responded not to the appeal of a tyrannical government. France desired nothing else but peace, order, and a legal sway. Every one's hand and voice were, from conflicting motives, raised against the Directory. Though many of the grievances were well founded, this wholesale accusation was unjust, and especially where it implicated four honest, though mediocre, lawyers, who were members of the govern ment ; while Barras, more guilty than any, retained his popularity. The great crime of the government was, that it did not understand the Revolutionary situation, from which the country had not emerged as yet. Its fall became unavoidable, each party doing its utmost to hasten it : the Legislative, to avenge the 18th of Fructi dor, and the annulling of the elections ; the army, which laid all the reverses at its door ; the Moderates, offended by its incapacity ; the Royalists and Jacobins, whom it had persecuted alternately, and who were now raising their heads, the first in the south and west, the second in Paris.\" Sieyes, Roger-Ducos, and Moulins were called to the Directory, together with Gohier, in place of Rewbell, Lareveillere, Treilhard, and Merlin, deposed. Meanwhile the external dangers of France had in creased. Joubert had been killed at Novi. The French had been defeated at Trebbia. The Austrians had taken Mantua. But these defeats in June and July had been followed by victories in the latter part of the year. Brune vanquished the Anglo-Russians at Bergen in Sep-"], [661, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 573 tember, and in October the Duke of York, finding his army reduced to twenty thousand men, who were threat ened with starvation, signed a humiliating capitulation, and embarked with his troops for England. England gave up to France eight thousand prisoners without ex change, but she kept the ships taken from the Dutch. In September occurred the battle of Zurich, in which the Russians were completely vanquished by Massena, and General Korsakoff with difficulty escaped to the Rhine with fourteen thousand men. The French gen eral Soult had meanwhile defeated Hotze, who was killed, and the French drove the Austrians behind the Rhine, taking three thousand prisoners and thirty can non. Suvarof, leaving behind guns, baggage, and six teen hundred prisoners, threw himself into the terrible valley of Engi, crossed the Crispalt, and reaching Coire, retired into Bavaria, having left twelve thousand men in this march of thirty leagues across the highest glaziers of Europe. Thus France was once more secure on that side, and the emperor of Russia abandoned the coalition. But in the south the French were not successful. They were defeated by the Austrians at Novi, and were com pelled to retreat into the Maritime Alps, where they lay inactive, destitute, and dying of disease and exposure. Meanwhile Bonaparte was making his way to France from Egypt. He landed at Frejus October 9, 1799. The tidings of his victory at Aboukir having arrived simul taneously, his presence aroused the wildest enthusiasm. His road to Paris was a continual triumphant march. Of the two parties eager to avail themselves of his aid, Bonaparte preferred the Moderates. He instinctively abhorred anarchy, discord, weakness, and corruption. Napoleon had been about two weeks in Paris, when plans were formed to overthrow the Directory. The"], [662, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 574 generals of the army had clustered around Bonapar , and several members of the Ancients and Five Hundred were making overtures to him. At first Si6y&s and Napoleon mistrusted each other, but through Talley rand they were conciliated, and Si6yfes and Roger-Ducos thenceforth joined with Napoleon in the plans for the reconstruction of the government. It was resolved that the Legislative Body should he removed outside of Paris, under the pretext of a con- spiracy of the Jacobins. \" Si6y6s was sure of a majority in the Ancients. The commission of the inspectors of the Ancients, wholly at the disposal of Si&yes, was to propose to transfer the Legislative Body to St. Cloud. The Constitution actually conferred this right on the Council of the Ancients. To this measure that Council was to add another, which was not authorized by the Constitution ; namely, to commit the duty of protecting the transfer to a general of its selection ; that is to say, to Bonaparte. The Ancients were to invest him at the same time with the command of the 17th military division and of all the troops cantoned in Paris. With these forces Bonaparte was to escort the Legislative Body to St. Cloud. There the confederates hoped to make themselves masters of the Five Hundred, and to extort from them the decree of a provisional consulate. Sieyes and Roger-Ducos were, on that same day, to resign their office of Directors. It was proposed to compel Barras, Gohier, and Moulins to resign. The Directory would thus be disorganized by the dissolution of the majority ; they would then go to the Five Hundred, and tell them that there no longer existed a government and oblige them to appoint the three consuls.\" The 18th of Brumaire was fixed for obtaining the decree of transferrence, and the 19th for the memorable"], [663, "575 THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. sitting at St. Cloud. Sieyes and his friends undertook to obtain the decree of removal, while Bonaparte was to have the armed force in readiness, and to lead the troops to the Tuileries. Cornet, the deputy, as presi dent of the commission of the Ancients, was directed to make all necessary preparations in the night between the 17th and 18th for obtaining this important decree. Wise Cornet closes window-shutters, and carefully draws the curtains that the curious public may not be made aware of this midnight labor. Prudent Cornet, with sagacious forethought, provides that the letters of con vocation addressed to certain deputies, of whom he is distrustful, shall be delayed in delivery, that so these inconvenient members may arrive too late for interfer ence in the decision. Cornet does also see to it that the Council of the Ancients shall be convoked by seven o'clock, whereas the Five Hundred shall not be summoned until eleven. \"In this manner the decree of translation would be passed before the Five Hundred had met; and as all discussion was forbidden by the Constitution at the moment when the decree of translation was promulgated, the tribune of the Five Hundred would be closed by this promulgation.\" On the morning of the 18th the members of the Ancients hastened to their posts, marvelling at this sudden convocation. When the Ancients had assembled, Cornet, the president of the commission of inspectors, addressed the body. He stated that reports had been circulated that dangerous conspiracies were being planned in Paris ; that thereby the national representatives were menaced, and proposed that the Council of the Ancients should decree that the Councils should remove to St. Cloud for safety, and that General Bonaparte should"], [664, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 576 be elected to command the troops which should act as escort to the Legislative Body. At eight o'clock the decree was passed with but slight opposition. This decree transferred the Councils to St. Cloud, and con voked them there for the following day at twelve o'clock. Bonaparte was appointed commander-in-chief of all the troops in the 17th military division of the guard of the Legislative Body, of the guard of the Directory, and of the national guards of Paris and the environs. Napo leon was summoned to the Council of Ancients to take the oath and receive the decree. He immediately mounted his horse and proceeded to the Tuileries, surrounded by a magnificent staff of officers, consisting of Moreau, Macdonald, Berthier, Lannes, Murat, Leclerc, and others. He presented him self at the bar of the Council, and thus addressed the Assembly : \u2014 \"Citizens Representatives, the Republic was on the point of perishing. Your decree has saved it. Woe to those who shall attempt to oppose its execution ! Aided by all my companions in arms here assembled around me, I shall find means to prevent their efforts. We will have the Republic. We will have it founded on genuine liberty on the representative system. We will have it \u2014 I swear in my own name and in the name of my com panions in arms.\" The Assembly broke up immediately, and Bonaparte departed to review his troops. He was everywhere greeted with the greatest enthusiasm. At this time the Five Hundred proceeded in excitement to their hall, having been apprised of the strange proceedings of the morning. Upon assembling, they received a message from the Council of Ancients, containing the decree of"], [665, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 577 translation. On reading it, a tumult of voices expressed disapprobation ; but the president, Lucien Bonaparte, enjoined silence by virtue of the Constitution, which forbade further deliberation. The Five Hundred were accordingly dismissed. Meanwhile the resignation of Barras had been extorted by Talleyrand ; and as Sieyes and Roger-Ducos had tendered their resignations, though the remaining two, Gohier and Moulins, refused to follow their example, being in the minority, they were power less to prevent the dissolution of the Directory. \" There was now no longer any executive power. Bonaparte had singly all the force in his own hands. All the ministers had assembled at the commission of the inspectors where he was. All orders emanated thence as from the only point where any organized authority existed.\" Next morning, the 19th Brumaire (November 10th), the road to St. Cloud was thronged with a curious crowd. Three halls had been prepared at the palace, \u2014 one for the Ancients, one for the Five Hundred, and a third for the commission of the inspectors and Bonaparte. The sitting of the two Councils commenced at two o'clock. The Council of the Ancients was at first quiet and orderly ; but that of the Five Hundred was a scene of the wildest excitement. Cries arose from all parts of the hall : \" Down with the dictators ! \" \" The Constitution or death ! \" In vain the president, Lucien Bonaparte, sought to still the tumult. It was proposed to take the oath of the Constitution of the Year III. The motion was in stantly adopted, and Lucien himself was forced to leave his chair to take the oath. When things were thus assuming a dangerous turn, Bonaparte determined to go to the Councils to use his personal influence. His speech before the Ancients was favorably received, and the"], [666, "578 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Council granted him the honors of the sitting. But when he entered the hall of the Five Hundred, accom panied by some grenadiers, whom, however, he left at the extremity of the apartment, he was accosted with menacing cries: \"What! soldiers here ! arms! Down with the dictator ! down with the tyrant ! \" And over whelmed by the tumult, Bonaparte was forced to leave the hall. The fury of the attack was now turned against Lucien Bonaparte, who endeavored in vain to quell the torrent of abuse heaped upon himself and brother. At length, taking off his cap and toga, he exclaimed, \"Wretches ! would you force me to outlaw my own brother ? I resign the chair, and I will go to the bar to defend him who is accused.\" Leaving the hall, Lucien joined Napoleon, who was surrounded by his troops ; and Lucien thus harangued the soldiers : \u2014 \" The Council of the Five Hundred is dissolved ; it is I that tell you so. Assassins have taken possession of the hall of meeting, and have done violence to the majority ; I summon you to march and clear it of them.\" Murat and Leclerc thereupon took a battalion of gren adiers and led them to the door of the council-hall of the Five Hundred. At the sight of the bayonets the deputies shouted, but their cries of indignant defiance were drowned by the rolling of the drums. \" Grenadiers, forward ! \" commanded the officers ; and as the grena diers entered the hall, the affrighted deputies escaped in all directions, and soon the apartment was cleared. When these tidings reached the Ancients, they were alarmed at such violent proceedings ; but Lucien Bonaparte appeared at their bar to justify his conduct, and his reasons were accepted by the Council. Though the Council of the Five Hundred was thus"], [667, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 579 summarily dissolved, there were some fifty deputies of their number who were in favor of the proposed change ; these, meeting together in haste, passed the necessary decree relative to the revolution just effected, and the decree was then carried to the Ancients, who adopted it about midnight. Bonaparte, Roger-Dueos, and Sieyes were nominated provisional Consuls, and invested with the entire executive power. The Councils were adjourned to the following February. They were replaced by two Commissions of twenty -five members each, selected from the Councils, and appointed to approve the legislative measures of the Consuls. The Consuls and the Com missions were empowered to frame a new constitution. In December the Constitution of the Year VIII. was made, and Bonaparte was nominated first Consul, Cam bac\u00a3r6s and Lebrun being associated with him as second and third Consuls. Regarding these events, Thiers says : \u2014 \" Such was the revolution of the 18th Brumaire, of which such opposite opinions are entertained ; which is regarded by some as an outrage which annihilated our struggling liberty ; by others, as a daring, but necessary act, that put an end to anarchy. What may justly be said of it is, that the Revolution, after assuming all the characters, monarchical, republican, and democratic, at length took the military character, because, amidst that perpetual conflict with Europe, it was requisite that it should constitute itself in a strong and solid manner. The Republicans deplore so many useless efforts, so much blood spilt to no purpose, in order to found liberty in France, and they are grieved to see it immolated by one of the heroes whom it had brought forth. But here the noblest of sentiments leads them into error. \" The Revolution, which was to give us liberty, and"], [668, "580 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. which has prepared everything for our enjoying it some day or other, was not itself, neither could it be, liberty. It was destined to be a great struggle against the old order of things. After conquering it in France it was requisite that it should conquer it in Europe. But so violent a struggle admitted not of the forms or of the spirit of liberty. For a moment, and but a brief one, the country possessed liberty under the Constituent Assem bly; but when the popular party became so menacing as to intimidate public opinion ; when it stormed the Tuileries on the 10th of August; when, on the 2d of September, it sacrificed all those of whom it felt dis trust ; when, on the 21st of January, it forced every one to compromise himself with it by imbruing his hands in royal blood; when, in August, 1793, it obliged all the citizens to hasten to the frontiers, or to part with their property ; when itself abdicated its power, and resigned it to that great Committee of Public Welfare, composed of twelve individuals \u2014 was there, could there be, liberty? No ; there was a violent effort of enthusiasm and hero ism ; there was the muscular tension of a* wrestler en gaged with a potent antagonist. After this moment of danger, after our victories, there was a moment of relax ation. The latter end of the Convention and the Direc tory exhibited moments of liberty. But the struggle with Europe could be only temporarily suspended. It soon recommenced, and, on the first reverse, all the parties rose against a too moderate government, and invoked a mighty arm. Bonaparte, returning from the East, was hailed as sovereign, and called to the supreme power. It is absurd to say that Zurich had saved France. Zurich was but an accident, a respite ; it required a Marengo and a Hohenlinden to save her. It required something more than military successes. It required a powerful"], [669, "THE DIRECTORY AND CONSULATE. 581 reorganization at home of all the departments of the gov ernment ; and it was a political chief, rather than a mili tary chief, that France needed. The 18th and 19th of Brumaire were, therefore, necessary.\" Thus the Directory was succeeded by the Consulate ; and later, the Consulate passed into the Empire ; and a man of the people sat upon the uplifted throne of mo narchical power. What the Revolution was, the preced ing pages have described ; what the Revolution accom plished, subsequent history has demonstrated. Carlyle says, \" I could not have believed in the justice of God, without the French Revolution.\" And surely every devout student of history cannot fail to trace the hand of a marvellous Providence through all these thrilling events, meting out the necessary sequences of centuries of crime, which, unfortunately, must fall upon the innocent as well as the guilty, so long as each man's life is indissolubly united with the lives of others. The French Revolution should be for all time a warn ing to all nations ; for it demonstrates irrefutably that Tyranny is never Government; that License is never Lib erty; that man's Reason can never supplant True Relig ion; that Order can never be maintained without Laiv. And above all, that an Omniscient God shapes the des tinies of men as well as nations ; and in the working out of His Divine plan for the redemption of mankind those governments which fail to acknowledge His Almighty Power will be swept away to give place to those who will spread His Gospel of Peace and honor Him as the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe."], [670, ""], [671, "CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF THE FRENCH REVO- LUTION. 1789.
