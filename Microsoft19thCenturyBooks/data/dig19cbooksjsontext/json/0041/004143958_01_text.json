Having the satisfaction of introducing to the Public this very pleasing and characteristic Poem, the Farmer's Boy, I think it will be agreeable to pre face it with a short Account of the manner in which it came into my hands: and, which will be much more interesting to every Reader, a little History of the Author, which has been communicated to me by his Brother, and which I shall very nearly tran scribe as it lies before me. In November last year * I receiv'd a MS. which I was requested to read, and to give my opinion of it. It had before been shewn to some persons in London : whose indifference toward it may probably be explain'd when it is consider'd that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation. With some a person must be rich, or titled, or fashionable as a literary name, or at least fashionable in some respect, good or bad, before any thing which he can offer will be thought worthy of notice.

At first I confess, seeing it divided into the four Seasons, I had to encounter a prepossession not very advantageous to any writer, that the Author was treading in a path already so admirably trod by Thomson; and might be adding one more to an attempt already so often, but so injudiciously and unhappily made, of transmuting that noble Poem from Blank Verse into Rhime;. . .from its own pure native Gold into an alloyed Metal of incomparably less splendor, permanence, and worth. I had soon, however, the pleasure of finding myself reliev'd from that apprehension : and of dis- covering that, although the delineation of Rural Scenery naturally branches itself into these divi- sions, there was little else except the General Qua- lities of a musical ear, flowing numbers, Feeling, Piety, poetic Imagery and Animation, a taste for the picturesque, a true sense of the natural and pathetic, force of thought, and liveliness of imagi- nation, which were in common between Thomson and this Author. And these are qualities which whoever has the eye, the heart, the awakened and surrounding intellect, and the diviner sense of the Poet, which alone can deserve the name, must possess. But, with these general Characters of true Poetry, \" The Farmer's Boy \" has, as I have said, a character of its own. It is discriminated as much"], [9, "PREFACE.

In writing to me, Mr. George Bloomfield, who is a Shoemaker also, as his Brother, and lives at Bury, thus expresses himself. \" As I spent five years with the Author, from the time he was thirteen years and a half old * till he was turned of eighteen, the most interesting time of life (I mean the time that instruction is acquir'd, if acquir'd at all), I think I am able to give a better account of him than any one can, or * This by farther recollection has since been discover'd and stated by Mr. G. and Mr. R.

One Sunday, after an whole day's stroll in the country, we by accident went into a dissenting Meeting-house in the Old Jewry, where a Gentle man was lecturing. This Man fill'd Robert with astonishment. The House was amazingly crowded with the most genteel people; and though we were fore 'd to stand still in the aisle, and were much press'd, yet Robert always quicken 'd his steps to get into the Town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this Lecture. \" The Preacher lived somewhere at the West End of the Town. . .his name was Fawcet.

And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly, he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play.\" \" I at that time,\" proceeds his Brother, \" read the London Magazine; and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a Review. . .Robert seem'd always eager to read this Review.

XII The Writer of this Preface doubts whether he has been successful in adding the last Stanza to this beautiful and simply expressive song. But he ima gin'd that some thought of this kind was in the mind of the Author : and he was willing to endea vour to express it. The Breast which has felt Love, justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction, as from annihilation itself. And there is even an high social and moral use in that order of Provi dence which exalts Sensations into tender and be nign Passions; those Passions into habitual Affec tions yet more tender; and raises from those Affec tions Virtues the most permanent, the most neces sary and beneficent, and the most endearing : thus expanding the sentiment into all the Charities of domestic and social Life. \" I remember,\" says Mr. G. Bloomfield, con tinuing his Narrative, \" a little piece which he called the Sailor's Return : * in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar, who, after a long absence, saw his dear native Village first rising into view. This too obtain'd a place in the Poet's Corner.\" \" And as he was so young,\" his brother pro ceeds, \" it shews some Genius in him, and some Industry, to have acquir'd so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time.

In our new Garret we found a singular character, James Kay, a native of Dundee. He was a middle aged man, of a good understanding, and yet a fu rious Calvinist. He had many Books,. . .and some which he did not value: such as the Seasons, Pa radise Lost, and some Novels. These Books he lent to Robert; who spent all his leisure hours in reading the Seasons, which he was now capable of reading.

This so exasperated the men, that their acting Com mittee soon looked for unlawful men (as they called them) among Chamberlayne' s workmen.\" They found out little Robert, and threatened to prosecute Chamberlayne for employing him, and to prosecute his Brother, Mr. G. Bloomfield, for teaching him. Chamberlayne requested of the Bro ther to go on and bring it to a Trial; for that he would defend it; and that neither George nor Ro bert should be hurt. In the mean time George was much insulted for having refus'd to join upon this occasion those who call'd themselves, exclusively, the Lawful Crafts. George, who says he was never famed for patience, (it is not indeed so much as might be sometimes wish'd, very often the lot of strong and acute minds to possess largely of this virtue,) took his pen, and address'd a Letter to one of the most active of their Committee-men (a man of very bad character). In this, after stating that he took Ro bert at his Mother's request, he made free as well served an Apprenticeship may be a partntr, contributing mo ney, or advice and attention to the accounts and general concerns of the Trade, provided that he does not actually exercise the Trade, and that the acting partner has served.

And here, with his mind glowing with the fine Descriptions of rural scenery which he found in Thomson's Seasons, he again retrac'd the very fields where first he began to think. Here, free from the smoke,* the noise, the contention of the city, he imbibed that Love of rural Simplicity and rural Innocence, which fitted him, in a great degree, to be the writer of such a thing as the Farmer's Boy.\" \" Here he liv'd two Months : ... at length, as the dispute in the trade still remain'd undecided, Mr. Dudbridge offer'd to take Robert Apprentice, to secure him, at all events, from any consequences of the Litigation.\" He was bound by Mr. Ingram, of Bell-alley, to Mr. John Dudbridge.

The treatment that my Brother Robert experienc'd from Mr. Austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the Servant Boys experienc'd who lived with him. Mr. Austin was Father of fourteen Children by my Aunt (he never had any other wife) . He left a decent provision for the five Children that surviv'd him: so that it could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor Relations. And I don't see a possibility of making a difference between Giles and the Boys that were not related to Mr. Austin: for he treated all his Servants exactly as he did his Sons. They all work'd hard; all liv'd well. The Duke had not a better Man Tenant to him than the late Mr. Austin. I saw num bers of the Husbandmen in tears when he was buried.

It reminds one of the simple, tender, and flow ing melody of the blank verse of Ro we : or of some of the affecting passages in the Paradise Regain d of Milton. Sweetness, pastoral Content, the innocent and benevolent heart \" with little pleas' d,\" breathe in deed through the Poems, and in the manners and conversation, of the Author of The Farmer's Boy. When the Spirit of Christianity declares \" blessed are the meek,\" every heart which considers what meekness is, feels the truth of that blessed ness. It may smooth the way, and prevent impedi ments, which a different temper raises to temporal felicity : it certainly assures that Heaven which is within : and is a pledge and anticipation of the Heaven hereafter. It is pleasing to think on a remark of Mr. Gko. Bloomfield concerning his Brother when he first went to London. \" I have him in my mind's eye \" a little Boy; not bigger than Boys generally are \" at twelve years old. When I met him and his \" Mother at the Inn,* he strutted before us, dress'd \"just as he came from keeping Sheep, Hogs, Sec... \" his shoes fill'd full of stumps in the heels.

And those who have shewn themselves the Friends of the Farmer's Boy must excuse me if I mention some of them whose liberal and zealous attention had excited those feelings in the heart of his Brother, and have fill'd his with sentiments of thankfulness. The Duke of Grafton has every way shewn himself attentive to the Genius, the Worth, of Mr. Bloomfield. He has essentially added to his comforts. Sir Charles Bunbury has warmly expressed his approbation of the Poem; as not only excellent for a Farmer's Boy, but such as would do honour to any person, whatever his edu cation : and he also has much contributed to make it early and advantageously known. Mr. Green of Ipswich has spoken of it as a charming com position : reflecting, in a very natural and vivid manner, the series of interesting images which touched the sensibility of a young, an artless, but a most intelligent observer of Nature; plac'd in a situation highly favourable to observation, though in fact not often productive of it. That Originality"], [29, "SUPPLEMENT. XXV in such a subject is invaluable : and that this Poem appears to him (I know few men so qualified to judge on such a point) throughout original. And literary characters who have earnt to themselves much of true Praise by their own Productions, Mr. Dyer and Dr. Drake of Hadleigh, have given full and appropriate encomium to the excellence both in Plan and Execution, of this admirable Rur al Poem.

In these verses, which have much of picturesque, there is a severe charge against Roots and Crows, as very formidable de predators; and their destruction, as such, seems to be recom mended. - Such was the prevalent opinion some years back. It is less general now: and I am sure the humanity of the Author, and his benevolence to Animals in general, will dis pose him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this sentence. And yet more so, if it shall appear that Rooks, at least, deserve not only mercy, but protection and encouragement from the Farmer. I shall quote a passage from Bewick's interesting History of Birds: the narrative part of which is often as full of infor mation as the embellishments cut in wood are beautiful. . . . It is this. Speaking of Birds of the Pie-kind in general, he says \" Birds of this kind * are found in every part of the known world, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope. In many respects they may be said to be of singular benefit to man kind : principally by destroying great quantities of noxious in \u25a0 sects, worms, and reptiles. Rooks, in particular, are fond of the eruc\u00e6 of the hedge-chaffer, or chgsnut brown beetle: for which they search with indefatigable pains. These insects,\" he adds in a note, \" appear in hot weather in formidable num- * P. 6j."], [144, "102 bers: disrobing the fields and trees of their verdure, blossoms, and fruit; spreading desolation and destruction wherever they go.. .They appeared in great numbers inlRELAND duringahot summer, and committed great ravages. In the year 1747 whole meadows and corn-fields were destroyed by them in Suffolk. The decrease of Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of, it. The many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so few of these destructive animals.\" * \" Rooks,\" he subjoins, \" are often accus'd of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown, and various contrivances have been made both to kill and frighten them away ; but, in our estimation, the advantages deriv'd from the destruction which they make among grubs, earth-worms, and noxious insects of various kinds, will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of corn they may destroy in searching after their favourite food.\" -f- \" In general they are sagacious, active, and faithful to each other. They live in pairs; and their mutual attachment is constant. They are a clamorous race: mostly build in trees, and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government. A Centinel watches for the general safety, and gives notice on the appearance of danger.\" Under the Title, \"Rooks,\" (p. 71) Mr. Bewick repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird. Wallis 's History of Notthu mbc-Iand, + Mr. Bewick docs not seem to have been quite aware that much of this mischief, as 1 have been informed by a sensible neighboring Farmer and Tenant, is done in the grub-state of the chaffer by biting through the roots of grass, &c.

We have two which were lam'd by being blown down in a storm (a calamity which destroys great numbers almost every spring). One of them is perfectly domesticated. The other is yet more remarkable; since although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home, his human friends, and early protectors. The Rook is certainly a very beautiful and very sensible Bird; very confiding, and very much attach'd. It will give me a pleasure, in which I doubt not that the Author of this delightful Poem will partake, if any thing here said shall avail them with the Farmer; and especially with the Suffolk Farmer.

The simplicity of their whole life contributes to soften the appearance of distinctions, and to re duce them to a level. Where the climate and the custom of the country do not absolutely require a perfect garment; where it is easy at every step to gather as many plants as form not only a decent, but likewise a customary covering; and where all the necessaries of life are within the reach of every indivi dual, at the expence of a trifling labour;. . .ambition and envy"], [146, "104 must in a great measure be unknown. It is true, the highest classes of people possess some dainty articles, such as pork, fish, fowl, and cloth, almost exclusively; but the desire of indulging the appetite in a few trifling luxuries can at most render individuals, and not whole nations, unhappy. Absolute want occasions the miseries of the lower class in some civiliz'd states, and is the rgsult of the unbounded voluptuousness of their superiors. At Olaheite there is not, in general, that dis parity between the highest and the meanest man, that subsists in England between a reputable tradesman and a labourer. The affection of the Otaheitans for their chiefs, which they never fail'd to express upon all occasions, gave us great reason to suppose that they consider themselves as one family, and respect their eldest born in the persons of their chiefs. The lowest man in the nation speaks as freely with his king as with his equal, and has the pleasure of seeing him as often as he likes. The king, at times, amuses himself with the occupa tions of his subjects; and not yet deprav'd by false notions of empty state, he often paddles his own canoe, without con sidering such an employment derogatory to his dignity. How long such an happy equality may last is uncertain: and how much the introduction of foreign luxuries may hasten its dis solution cannot be too frequently repeated to Europeans. If the knowledge of a few individuals can only be acquired at such a price as the happiness of nations, it were better for the dis coverers and the discovered that the South Sea had still remain'd unknown to Europe and its restless inhabitants.\" Reflections on Otaheite: Cook's second Voyage.
