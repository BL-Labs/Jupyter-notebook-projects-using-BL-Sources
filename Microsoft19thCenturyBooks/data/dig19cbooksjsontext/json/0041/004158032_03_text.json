Garrick and Lacy effected a most material stage reformation \u2014 which was afterwards adopted at C. G. \u2014 Wilkinson and Davies say that this was done in 1762. The theatres formerly were not large enough for the benefit night of a favourite performer \u2014 therefore the following advertisement was usually added on this occasion ; \" Part of the Pit will be railed into \" the Boxes, and the Stage will be formed into an \" Amphitheatre where servants will be allowed to \" keep places\"* see Mrs. Clive's bt. D. L. March 20 1738. * Tho' this amphitheatre seems in the first instance to have been meant for box company, yet it was not unusual in the case of an overflow, to admit persons at a lower rate \u2014 Mrs. Bellamy, VOL. v. B"], [12, "2 d. L. 1762-1763. When a great house was not expected, then the performer usually added to the bottom of the bill, \" N.B. not any building on the stage\"\u2014 what was termed a building on the stage was certainly the greatest nuisance that ever prevailed \u2014 Wilkinson tells us that he had seen Mrs. Cibber prostrating her self on an old couch covered with black cloth, as the tomb of the Capulets, with at least 200 persons be hind her \u2014 when Quin returned to the stage to play Falstaff for Ryan's benefit, notwithstanding the im patience of the audience to see their old acquaint ance, he was several minutes before he could pass through the numbers that wedged him in. (Wil kinson.) Holland acted Hamlet for his 1st benefit \u2014 he was born at Cheswick, in the neighbourhood of London, where his father then resided \u2014 when the night came, his friends attended, and his native village was left almost literally empty \u2014 among the rest of his visiting acquaintance, was a country girl, seated at the west end of the amphitheatre, where she had an easy egress. On the appearance of the Ghost, by the usual stage trick, Hamlet's hat flew off, and lay nearly at the damsel's feet\u2014 she, pitying the situation of her young friend, gently stole from her seat, took up the hat, and placed it upon Holland's head, with the in relating the quarrel between herself and Mrs. Hamilton, says, that Mrs. Hamilton having- a full gallery disposed of the overflow in the boxes, and upon the stage, preferring their two shillings apiece to empty benches \u2014 Holland must have done the same at his benefit."], [13, "d. l. 1762-1763. 3 broad corner foremost, as it is generally worn by a drunken man\u2014 she regained her seat with apparent exultation for the friendly feat she had performed, in defending the young prince from such a \" nipping \" and an eager air,\" as he had just been shivering un der, and Hamlet proceeded to finish the scene, uncon scious of the ridiculous figure in which he was placed \u2014 the audience, unwilling to break in upon the solem nity of the performance, bit their lips, and with dif ficulty restrained their risibility, till the Ghost and Hamlet were fairly off the stage, when they indulged themselves in one of the loudest laughs ever heard in a theatre.* But tho' it was on benefit nights alone that the public were allowed to seat themselves on the stage, yet gentlemen seem to have claimed a constant right of admission behind the scenes. Garrick was fully sensible of the absurdity of hav ing one audience on the stage, and another before the curtain \u2014he was reminded that Sheridan by his re solute behaviour had conquered the refractory spirit of the Irish Gentlemen, by shutting his stage-door against them ; and after suffering many vexations and much opposition, had supported his right with the sanction of legal authority \u2014 Much as Garrick wished for a reformation, yet he was for some time deterred by the obstacles that prevented it \u2014 he had three parties to encounter, all of them formidable, and when united, truly alarming \u2014 1st to banish * Wilkinson relates this story with rather more pleasantry ; but as Jackson was actually present, his account must be preferred. b2"], [14, "d. l. 1762-1763. 4 young men of fashion from behind the scenes was judged a daring attempt ; as the Manager's right to rule where they were concerned, was looked on as a vulgar law, to which none but the mean spirited sub mitted \u2014 2ndly, the going behind the scenes on benefit nights pleased young clerks and others, who liked to see the actresses nearer than they were accustomed to \u2014 Srdly most of the principal and some of the mid dling rank of performers, would not choose to pay the charges for their benefit nights, and be abridged of \u00a3100 or \u00a3150 advantage accruing from the build ing and general admission on the stage\u2014 Garrick and Lacy on consulting together, very judiciously con cluded, that the plan of reformation must be preceded by a considerable enlargement of the playhouse ; and that if it could be so contrived, that the space hefore the curtain should contain as many persons, as had formerly filled the pit, boxes, galleries, and the stage, nobody could have any pretence to murmur. The theatre was accordingly enlarged \u2014 Murphy says to a receipt of \u00a3335\u2014 and from that time scarcely any but the performers were permitted to visit the scenes of the playhouse.

Thus, according to Victor, Silvia had not only de termined to marry Valentine before he had plainly declared his love for her, but had even written a paper with directions for their marriage and escape \u2014 Speed had said to Valentine \" for often you have \" writ to her,\" &c. \u2014 this however is only a quotation \u2014 Speed expressly says that he found it in print Launce speaks his 1st soliloquy at Milan instead of Verona \u2014 an alteration much for the worse.

Act 4th differs but little from the original \u2014 Launce's soliloquy is marked as omitted in representation \u2014 the short scene between Silvia and Eglamour, with which Shakspeare begins his 5th act, is judiciously transferred to the conclusion of this act.

Victor has made a very great improve ment in this act \u2014 according to Shakspeare, Valentine, after he is reconciled to Protheus, says \u2014 \" All, that was mine in Silvia, I give thee.\" Pope, Hanmer and Steevens allow that this is un natural\u2014according to Victor, when Protheus offers to force Silvia, Valentine advances, and orders the outlaws to seize Protheus \u2014 he then addresses Silvia"], [21, "d. l. 1762-1763. 11 and tells her to dismiss her fears as she is in safety after which he reproaches Protheus and then is reconciled to him \u2014 the exceptionable line is of course omitted \u2014 Victor has added 2 short scenes for the sake of bringing Launce and Speed on the stage in this act \u2014 but as these scenes are unnecessary, and not worthy of Shakspeare, they would have been better omitted for Kemble's alteration of this play, which is in a considerable degree borrowed from Victor's, see C.

Mallet wrote his poem on Verbal Criticism to pay court to Pope by attacking Theobald, who revenged himself by observing, that \" an anonymous writer, \" like a Scotch pedlar in wit, had unbraced his pack \" on the subject ; of whom I may fairly say, as Fal \" staff does of Poins, ' Hang him baboon ! his wit \" is as thick as Tewksbury mustard ; there is no \" more conceit in him than in a Mallet.' \" Mallet published Lord Bolingbroke's posthumous works \u2014the first striking sentence which Murphy"], [24, "14 d. l. 1762-1763. heard from Dr. Johnson was in some few days after their publication \u2014 Garrick asked Johnson \" if he had \" seen them ?\" \u2014 ' Yes, I have seen them' \u2014 \" What do \" you think of them ?\"\u2014 ' think of them !'\u2014 he made a long pause, and then replied \u2014 ' think of them ! a ' scoundrel and a coward ! a scoundrel, who spent ' his life in charging a gun against Christianity; and a ' coward, who was afraid of hearing the report of ' his own gun ; but left half a crown to a hungry ' Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death.' \u2014 {Murphy's Life of Johnson.)

For the author of the alterations, Two Gentlemen of Verona \u2014 this play had been performed 5 times with success, but on this night a serious riot took place \u2014 Cooke says \u2014 \" Mr. Fitzpatrick, a gentle \" man of independent fortune, and a critic of some \" note in his time, having had some trifling dispute \" with Garrick at a club they belonged to, Avas mean \" enough to carry his resentments to the actor, and, \" like all men possessed of the spirit of malice, \" sought his revenge at the expense of his judgment ; \" hence he exposed himself, by almost daily criticisms \" on the action and elocution of Garrick.\" In 1762-1763 Fitzpatrick, still retaining his male volence to Garrick, had put himself at the head of a set of young men, who called themselves the Town \u2014they consulted together, and had determined to compel the managers to admit them at the end of the 3rd act, at half price, to every performance, except during the run of a new Pantomime \u2014 and they chose to make that demand on the 6th night of the Two Gentlemen of Verona, tho' it was for the benefit of the author of the alterations, and so expressed in the"], [25, "d. L. 1762-1763. 15 bills \u2014 {Victor) \u2014 but propriety and justice are seldom attended to by playhouse rioters. Fitzpatrick harangued the spectators' from the boxes, and set forth in very warm and opprobrious language the impositions of the managers ; and with much vehemence pleaded the right of the audience to fix the prices of admission \u2014 when Garrick came forward to address the house, he was received with noise and uproar ; and treated with the utmost con tempt by Fitzpatrick and his associates \u2014 he was not allowed a night's time, no, not an hour's, to deliberate on a matter of such importance ; but was called on to yield unconditional submission \u2014 the consequence of his not giving up instantly the privileges of authors to the superiour claims of dumb show, was the tear ing up of the benches, the breaking of the lustres, and the committing of every act of violence, which rage and malice could suggest \u2014 on the next night the riot was renewed ; and Garrick thought it most pru dent to comply with what had been demanded of him \u2014 peace however was not to be restored till some of the Players had been punished for daring to espouse the cause of the Manager \u2014 Moody was called on to apo logize for the offence he had committed in stopping a madman's hand, who was going to set fire to the playhouse \u2014 he, imagining that he should bring the audience into good humour by a laughable absurdity, in the tone and language of a low-bred Irishman, said, \" he was very sorry he had displeased them, by \" saving their lives in putting out the fire \" \u2014 this speech was so ill taken, that it rather inflamed than cooled their rage ; and they loudly and vehemently insisted that he should go down on his knees and ask"], [26, "16 d. l. 1762-1763. their pardon : this, Moody was so far from complying with, that he had the courage absolutely to refuse, saying \" I will not by Heaven \" \u2014 when he came off the stage, Garrick was so pleased with his behaviour, that he received him with open arms, and assured him that while he. had a guinea, he should be paid his salary ; but that if he had been mean enough to have submitted, he would never have forgiven him \u2014 the tumult however was so great, that in order to ap pease the rioters, Garrick promised that Moody should not appear on the stage again, while he was under their displeasure \u2014 Moody's situation was very un pleasant \u2014 he was reduced to the necessity of leaving the capital, or depending on the manager's generosity \u2014 after weighing all the consequences, he determined on seeking redress from Fitzpatrick himself\u2014the conversation that ensued between them, Davies has particularly recorded \u2014 the result was, that Fitzpat rick wrote to Garrick in a condescending stile, and promised that he and his friends would support Moody the next time he appeared on the stage. {Davies.) Moody's conduct on this occasion was as spirited and creditable to himself, as Fitzpatrick's was cruel and mean ; tyrannical where he thought he could oppress, and cowardly when called to a personal account. When an Actor comes on the stage drunk ; or is in any other way notoriously deficient in his duty at the theatre, the Public has an undoubted right to call him to an account, and to insist on an apology but when a man merely because he has paid some few shillings at the door of a playhouse, considers him-"], [27, "r>. l. 1762-1763. 17 self as entitled to insult a performer, by wantonly hissing\u2014 or to call on him for an apology, where he has not been to blame \u2014whatever his situation in life may be, he is no longer worthy of the appellation of a Gentleman \u2014 for certainly no one, who is not des titute of liberality and humanity, will take advantage of the peculiar situation of an Actor, or endeavour to exact such compliances from him, as must degrade him as a man \u2014 \" Oh, it is excellent \" To have a Giant's strength ; but it is tyrannous \" To use it like a Giant.\" Murphy says that Fitzpatrick was admired for his talents and amiable manners ; and that Churchill inserted in the Rosciad a cruel caricature of him to gratify the resentment of Garrick Davies details the origin of Fitzpatrick's personal dislike to Gar rick, and gives an account of his rancorous attacks on him as an actor \u2014 his statement agrees with Cooke's, and what they say seems more consonant to truth than Murphy's account but if all that Murphy has been pleased to say of Fitzpatrick were true, yet it would not be the slightest vindication of his con duct in the affair of the riot.

Dec. 11 1730 Medea was Mrs. Yates' grand part, but the performance of it was attended with so much fatigue that she very rarely acted it, except for her benefit When Mrs. Siddons was applied to by some of Glover's family to act Medea, she said she did not choose her own characters ; which was true \u2014 but her real reason for declining the part (and that a very sufficient one) probably was, that she was afraid of the exertion it would require; for Medea was as completely in Mrs. Siddons' line of acting, as if it had been expressly written for her. 28.

Soon after the opening of the theatre, Harris de sired that Mrs. Lessingham might act Imogen instead of Miss Ward, to whom the part had been allotted in the cast book ; Colman said that as a friend to Mrs. Lessingham, he would advise her never to play a line of Tragedy ; but the matter at that time pro duced no contention \u2014 on Sep. 18 Mrs. Lessingham returned the part of Nerissa to the Prompter with an"], [218, "208 c.

(Murphy.) Foote, either from envy of Garrick's taking the lead in this business, or from thinking that he con ducted it with too much vanity and self-ostentation, looked with a jealous eye upon the whole, and hence took every little occasion, in squibs, sarcasms, and bon-mots, to arraign the projector's taste and ma nagement. This conduct, however, passed off with a laugh on both sides, till the winter following; when, finding that Garrick meant to convert his Jubilee into an object of profit, by bringing out a representation of it on the stage, Foote's spleen could be restrained no longer \u2014 he played off his powers of ridicule on every part of the subject, both in company and in the public papers ; particularly on the Ode on erecting a Statue to Shakspeare, in which he pointed out some errors and inaccuracies with such force of humour, as gained the greatest part of the laughers on his side. He carried his satire still further ; for, finding that the entertainment of The Stratford Jubilee ran to ninety nights in that season, his jealousy became"], [264, "254 d. l. 1769-1770. so strong, that he intended to bring out a mock pro cession in imitation of it, and introduce Garrick him self on the stage as the principal figure \u2014 in this pro cession, a man was to be dressed out so as to resemble Garrick as much as possible in the character of Stew ard of the Jubilee, with his wand, white-topped gloves, and the mulberry-tree medallion of Shakspeare hang ing at his breast ; while some ragamuffin in the pro cession should address him in 2 well known lines of the grossest flattery \u2014 to this Garrick's representative was to make no other answer, but clap his arms, like the wings of a cock, and crow out, Cock-a-doodle doo ! Garrick had early intelligence of his whole scheme, and the uneasiness which he felt upon the occasion could not be dissembled \u2014 he dreaded public ridicule as the most painful of all misfortunes ; and in the hands of such a man as Foote, he apprehended the decay, perhaps the ruin, of that reputation which was ever dear to him, and which he had been raising for so many years \u2014 however, suddenly this mighty project fell to the ground \u2014 a Nobleman, the mutual friend of both, seeing Garrick so very unhappy about this menaced caricature, prevailed upon Foote to abandon the design \u2014 the parties met, as if by acci dent, at the house of this nobleman ; when, alight ing at the same time from their chariots at his lord ship's door, and exchanging significant looks at each other, Garrick broke silence first, by asking, \" Is it \" war or peace ?\" \u2014 \" Oh ! peace, by all means,\" said the other, with much apparent good-will ; and the day was spent in great cordiality.

The manner in which he played Macbeth deserves to be noticed \u2014 before this time Macbeth used to be dressed in a suit of scarlet and gold, a tail wig, &c. \u25a0 \u2014 Garrick always played the part in this manner \u2014 Barry and Smith did the same \u2014 Macklin saw the absurdity, and dressed the subordinate characters as well as himself in the Caledonian habit \u2014 this refor mation, which is now become general, does him more credit than his performance of the character \u2014 his figure (even from his boyish days) was never calcu lated to impress the idea of a dignified warrior, and when the audience saw a clumsey old man, who looked more like a Scotch piper, than a general and prince of the blood, stumping down the stage at the head of an army, they were naturally inclined to laugh \u2014 his address to the Witches and his reflections on their prophecies were however given with such a knowledge of the character as to redeem the first impression \u2014 and his subsequent interview with Lady Macbeth was very much in the spirit of the author \u2014 but when he came to the dagger scene he failed \u2014 in his clamour against the King's death and his hypo crisy in concealing it, he very much arrested the attention of the audience, as he likewise did in his"], [438, "c. g. 1773-1774. 428 interview with the murderers \u2014 but in the Banquet scene he failed again \u2014 in the 4th and 5th acts he had alternately merits and defects \u2014 in his reply to the messenger about Birnam Wood \u2014 \" if thou speak'st \" false,\" &c. \u2014 he delivered the first part of the speech in a tone and look of such terrible menace as almost petrified the audience \u2014 while in the last line he fell into such an air of despondency, as showed the effect of contrast in a most masterly manner \u2014 in short this little speech might be reckoned among the finest pieces of acting, and as such was applauded by the whole audience. It was lucky for the fame of Macklin that his per formance of the intended characters was frustrated in his first attempt \u2014 had he been permitted to go quietly on, his vanity would have imputed the indul gence of the audience to superiour abilities, and he would have gone through the whole of his design \u2014 by which means he would have lost in a great degree (at least with the rising generation) that reputation which, in other walks of his profession, he had during a long course of years deservedly gained. ( Cooke.) Macklin brought an action against 5 of the rioters in the Court of King's Bench \u2014 they were found guilty \u2014 Lord Mansfield allowed that every person in a play-house had a right to express his approbation or disapprobation instantaneously, but said the crime of the 5 rioters consisted in their coming to the theatre not to approve or disapprove, as the sentiments of their mind might be, but with a black design to ruin Macklin, which was the most ungenerous thing that could be \u2014 for what a terrible condition is an actor upon the stage in with an enemy who makes part of"], [439, "c. g. 1773-1774. 429 the audience ! \u2014 he added that a jury would give con siderable damages, but that it would be better for both sides to refer them to the Master, and he should direct him to make a liberal satisfaction\u2014 Macklin offered to drop all farther proceedings, if the rioters would pay his costs and take \u00a3100 worth of tickets for his daughter's benefit, the same number for him self, and a 3d hundred pounds' worth as a sort of compensation to the managers\u2014 this was agreed to \u2014 and Lord Mansfield concluded the whole with saying to Macklin \u2014 \"You have met with great applause to \" day \u2014 you never acted better.\" The rioters ought to have contented themselves with exacting a promise from the managers that Macklin should not act Macbeth again \u2014 some slight apology might also have been demanded for what he had said of Reddish, but his enemies called out to him to go down on his knees\u2014 and when Macklin attempted to show the reasons for his assertion they would not hear him \u2014 Lord Mansfield allowed that Macklin was in part wrong, and that if some mortifi cation had been put upon him, it would not have been much amiss, but the rioters carried their resentment too far, when they insisted that the managers should discharge him and take his bread from him \u2014 Mr. Justice Aston in the course of the business asked, \" why should Macklin's acting of Shylock and Sir \" Archy produce a riot ? because he offended them \" in acting Macbeth, they would not let him play the \" parts he was confessedly very capable of\" Kirk man has filled more than 190 pages of his 2d vol. with a detail of the trial, in which the few theatrical"], [440, "430 HAY. 1774. facts of importance are \" like two grains of wheat \" hid in two bushels of chaff ; you shall seek all day \" ere you find them, and when you have them, they \" are not worth the search.\" HAY. 1774.

After the play was over, Garrick took leave of the public in a prose address, and bowing respectfully to all parts of the house, withdrew. He was for some time inclined to end his course with the part he at first set out with ; but upon con sideration he judged, that, after the fatigue of so laborious a character as Richard, it would be out of VOL.

The 1st benefit for the Theatrical Fund seems to have been the usual one\u2014 the 2d seems to have been a gift from Garrick instead of taking it for himself. (Bills from B. M. and Mr. Woods aU.) Nature had done so much for Garrick that he could not help being an actor \u2014 she gave him a frame of so manageable a proportion, and from its flexi- bility so perfectly under command, that by its aptitude and elasticity he could suit it to any sort of character \u2014 his eye was so penetrating, so speaking, his brow so moveable and all his features so plastic and accom- modating, that wherever his mind impelled them, they would go, and before his tongue could give the text, his countenance would express the spirit and passion of the part he was encharged with \u2014 (Cum- berland) \u2014 his voice was harmonious\u2014 his figure low, but pleasing and manly\u2014 his great aim in all his per- formances was to follow nature\u2014 he never indulged the wantonness of his fancy in stepping beyond her \u2014 tho' every passion of the human mind lay before him, he chiefly excelled in the stronger and more violent transports of the soul \u2014 his love was elegantly and ardently displayed, but he had not that overflow of tenderness, that profusion of softness, for which Barry was celebrated\u2014 in resentment, anger, terror, rage, horror, and madness, it is impossible to give an adequate idea of him ; he was unrivalled in them"], [509, "D. l. 1775-1776. 499 all\u2014 he excelled in all mixt representations of grief and anger, fear and rage, in short the more compli cated the passions were, the more happy was he in his representation of them. (Gent.'s 3tagazine.) \" Take him for all in all \" We shall not look upon his like again.\" Macklin, from personal dislike to Garrick, gives a most unfavourable character of him both as a man and as an actor, he says \" Garrick huddled all pas \" sions into strut and quickness \u2014 bustle was his \" favourite \u2014 in Archer \u2014 Ranger \u2014 Don John \u2014 \" Hamlet \u2014 Macbeth \u2014 Brute\u2014 all was bustle\u2014 bustle \" \u2014 bustle \" \u2014 and again \u2014\"all the requisites Garrick \" wanted in order to make him a great actor were \u2014 \" consequence \u2014 dignity \u2014 elegance \u2014 and majesty of \" figure \u2014 a voice that could last through a part (for \" he was generally hoarse in the last two acts) \u2014 the \" deportment and manners of a Gentleman \u2014 a know \" ledge of the passion and character \u2014 and how to \" dress with propriety.\" Macklin's malice is so apparent that it defeats its own purpose \u2014 he is however so far right, that an intimate friend of Garrick told me, that (like Wilks) he could not stand still on the stage. As a manager, Garrick is said to have often called forth latent worth \u2014 this is doubtless true ; but the stupidestmanager that ever existed, could hardly have given less encouragement to Mrs. Abington and Shuter than he did. His literary abilities have been greatly overrated by the generality of people \u2014 Dr. Johnson is said to have holden them in a considerable degree of con- ic k 2"], [510, "d. L. 1775-1776. 500 tempt ; he once told him that he knew nothing about books ; and he said of his Ode on Shakspeare that it defied criticism. Garrick's alterations of old plays are highly judi cious when he does not attempt too much \u2014 when he goes beyond a certain point, he only exposes himself \u2014 he knew he could act, and he fancied he could write.* Some of Garrick's little pieces do him credit, par ticularly \u2014 Lying Valet\u2014 Miss in her Teens \u2014 Guar dian \u2014 Irish Widow and Bon Ton. Several of Garrick's Prologues and Epilogues are good ; but many of them would have met with little notice, if he had been an inferiour actor \u2014 it seems a strange perversion of judgment in Murphy to put them in competition with those of Dryden \u2014 Murphy says Garrick wrote fourscore Prologues and Epi logues, and that Dryden's did not amount to half that number\u2014 he forgot to count those to Dryden's own plays. Goldsmith in his poem of Retaliation, draws a striking picture of Garrick \u2014 \" Here lies David Garrick, describe him who can, \" An abridgement of all that was pleasant in man: * Persius says to Nero \u2014 Tollat sua munera cerdo : Tecum habita, et ndris quam git tibi curta supellex. \u2014 Let the multitude take away their applause, and you will soon find how slightly furnished your upper story is."], [511, "D. l. 1775-1776. 501 \" As an actor, confess'd without rival to shine ; \" As a wit,* if not first, in the very first line : \" Yet with talents like these and an excellent \" heart, \" The man had his failings\u2014 a dupe to his art. \" Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread \" And be-plastered with rouge his own natural \" red. \u00ab\u00ab On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting; \" 'Twas only that when he was off, he was acting. \" With no reason on earth to go out of his way, \" He turn'd and he varied full ten times a day ; \" Tho' secure of all hearts, yet confoundedly sick, \" If they were not his own by finessing and trick ; \" He cast off his friends, as a huntsman his pack, \" For he knew when he pleased, he could whistle \" them back. \" Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what \" came, \" And the puff of a dunce, he mistook it for fame, \" Till his relish grown callous almost to disease \" Who pepper'd the highest was surest to \" please.\" &c. This last was Garrick's great weakness \u2014 Paul Whitehead said to him \u2014 \" A nation's taste depends on you, \" Perhaps a nation's virtue too.\" \" Quid apertius ? et tamen Mi \" Surgebant crist\u0153.\" \u2014 Juvenal. * His wit was generally tinsel."], [512, "ill. 1775-1776. 502 Gross as this flattery was, it is strongly to be sus pected that Garrick was pleased with it.* Envy was his greatest fault \u2014 his panegyrist Davies acknowledges, that he never heard him speak warmly in commendation of any actor living or dead. His misfortune was that he had never due confi dence in his talents\u2014 his love of fame was unbounded ; but it was \" tremblingly alive all o'er\" \u2014 he lived in a whispering gallery, always listening and anxious about himself\u2014 upon such a disposition, they who lacquied after him, could make what impression they pleased \u2014 a word was sufficient ; he took fire at the slightest hint ; and they who had sinister purposes to answer, saw the avenues by which they were to approach him ; by the arts of such men, he, who might always have been at ease, and by his talents deserved to be so, was ever involved in little disputes and jealousies, that made him unhappy through life. {Murphy.) Dr. Johnson and Garrick came to London together to seek their fortunes \u2014 they continued friends to the last ; but their friendship had an interval of coolness \u2014 No. 200 of the Rambler does not at first appear to have any particular merit, but when we know that Prospero was meant for Garrick and Asper for Dr. Johnson, it becomes interesting. Garrick was hurt that his old friend did not think so highly of his dramatic art as the rest of the world * Iolaus in the Heraclid\u00e6 says \" it is an invidious thing to \" praise too much ; I myself have been often disgusted with too \" lavish praise \" \u2014 Euripides probably made Iolaus speak bis own sentiment."], [513, "n. l. 1775-1776. 503 \u2014 the fact was, Johnson could not see the passions as they rose and chased one another in the varied features of that expressive face ; and by his own manner of reciting verses, which was wonderfully impressive, he plainly showed that he thought there was too much of artificial tone and measured cadence in the declamation of the theatre \u2014 Murphy was one night in conversation with Dr. Johnson near the side of the scenes during the Tragedy of King Lear \u2014 when Garrick came off the stage, he said \" You two \" talk so loud you destroy all my feelings\" \u2014 \" Pri thee\" replied Johnson, \" do not talk of feelings, \" Punch has no feelings\" \u2014 this seems to have been his settled opinion ; admirable as Garrick's imitation of nature always was, Johnson thought it no better than mere mimickry \u2014 yet it is certain that he es teemed and loved Garrick ; that he dwelt with pleasure on his praise ; and used to declare that he deserved his great success, because on all applications for charity he gave more than was asked \u2014 after Gar rick's death he never talked of him without a tear in his eyes \u2014 he offered, if Mrs. Garrick would desire it of him, to be the editor of his works, and the historian of his Life \u2014 on his deathbed he thought of writing a Latin inscription to the memory of his friend \u2014 {Murphy) \u2014 in his Life of Smith he had said \u2014 \" the \" death of Garrick has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, \" and impoverished the stock of harmless pleasure.\" When Jedediah Buxton, so well known for his astonishing calculations, was in London, he was car ried to see Garrick in Richard ; it was expected that the novelty and splendour of the show would have fixed him in astonishment, or kept his imagination in"], [514, "d. l. 1775-1776. 504 a continual hurry, or that his passions would in some degree have been touched by the power of action, if he did not perfectly understand the dialogue : but Jedediah's mind was employed in the playhouse just as it was elsewhere : during the dance he fixed his attention on the number of the steps ; he declared, after a fine piece of music, that the innumerable sounds produced by the instruments had perplexed him beyond measure ; and he attended to Garrick only to count the words that he uttered, in which he said, he perfectly succeeded. {Gent's Mag. vol. 24.) Not long after Garrick's death a Farce was pub lished called \" Garrick in the Shades, or a Peep into \" Elysium\" \u2014 it is a poor production on the whole, but there are some few good observations in it \u2014 Garrick is represented as much hurt at the cold reception which Shakspeare gave him \u2014 Shakspeare says of Garrick \u2014 \" His fam'd Jubilee, was a mean device \" To gull the people\u2014 to cram his well-filPd \" purse \" Already had my name surviv'd an age \u2014 \" And yet shall live \u2014 when all his tinsel show \" Of dull, unmeaning pageantry's forgot.\" Garrick says \u2014 \" Have I been all this time hood \" winked by my own vanity ! \u2014 Fool that I was ! could \" I suppose, that by erecting temples to Shakspeare, \u2022 and monopolizing him on the stage, it would always \" be believed, that I alone understood him \u2014that I \" was his best \u2014 his only perfect commentator ?\" &c.

Wilkinson, who cannot be suspected of partiality to Foote, says, that if ever one person possessed the talent of pleasing more than another, it was he \u2014 Gar rick was very inferiour to him in wit and repartee \u2014 Foote was not confined to any particular topic, he was equal to all \u2014 religion, law, politics, the manners of this or any age, and the stage of course \u2014 as a wit"], [615, "HAY. 1777. 605 he was of the first rank ; but not satisfied in com pany, unless every eye was directed to him ; he could not bear any one to slip in a good story, or give any entertaining information \u2014 a well-known Gentleman of the name of Chace Price was the only person of true wit that Foote would allow to be so, or with whom he would laugh and listen to with pleasure ; but Foote actually praised Chace Price behind his back. One part of his conduct was highly censurable \u2014 his propensity to turn every body into ridicule \u2014 it was policy not to quit the room where he was, as the moment a person's back was turned, he was cer tain to be served up \" raw or roasted\" without mercy, although that person might an hour before have con ferred a serious obligation on him \u2014 when Murphy, in Know your own Mind, said \" could not you stay till 'my back was fairly turned?\" Wilkinson thinks that he wrote this line with a view to Foote. Foote's own peculiarities were full as extravagant as those of any person, whose gait, gesture, or his tory, he might choose to divert himself with. In his Imitations he had been particularly severe \u2014 but when imitated himself, he was as sore as any body ; of which Wilkinson gives a striking instance, that happened one night at Dublin. Garrick was afraid of Foote and did every thing in his power to conciliate him \u2014 Foote behaved very ill to Garrick\u2014 in contradiction to all the world he questioned his abilities as an actor, and said every thing against him, that he well could as a man \u2014 Garrick happened one day to pay him a visit and was surprised to see a bust of himself placed on Foote's"], [616, "606 HAY. 1777. bureau \u2014 \" Is this intended as a compliment to me ?\" said Garrick \u2014 \" certainly\" \u2014 \" and can you trust me \" so near your cash and your bank notes ?\" \u2014 \" Yes, \" very well,\" said Foote, \"for you see you have no \" hands\" \u2014 Two bon mots on Garrick's love of money and love of acting, Foote took care to repeat, as often as they came into his mind \u2014 that he loved money so well, that whenever he should retire from the stage, he was sure to commence Banker's Clerk for the plea sure of counting over the cash \u2014 and that as for his love of acting, he was so fond of it, that rather than not play, he would act in the hottest kitchen in the dog days for a sop in the pan \u2014 Foote had a supreme contempt for Garrick's Poetiy, and expressed a fear of dying before him, lest Garrick should write his Epitaph. ( Wilkinson and Davies.) They were remarkable at Dublin, when pleased, for continuing to applaud till the curtain fell, often not suffering the play to finish \u2014 this was a compli ment frequently paid to Sheridan ; which occasioned Foote to say \" my dear Sheridan I wish you would \" relieve yourself of a great deal of labour and \"trouble\" \u2014 \"in what manner?\" says Sheridan \u2014 \" why,\" says Foote, \" instead of acting Richard the \" 3d, act Henry the 6th in the same Tragedy\" \u2014 \" Heavens, Mr. Foote, why should I relinquish \" Richard, where you are witness I get such univer sal applause ? give me your reason\" \u2014 \" O,\" says Foote, \" the best reason in the world ; for if you will \" perform Henry instead of Richard, the play will \" finish in the first act, and the players may go home \" in good time to supper.\" ( Wilkinson and Davies.) A number of friends dined with Garrick on a"], [617, "HAY. 1777. 607 Christmas day -Foote was then in Ireland\u2014 it was said at table, that Foote had been horse-whipped by a Dublin apothecary, for mimicking him on the stage \u2014 \" I wonder,\" said Garrick, \" that any man should \" show so much resentment to Foote ; he has a \" patent for such liberties ; nobody ever thought it \" worth his while to quarrel with him in London \" \u2014 \" I am glad,\" said Dr. Johnson, \" to find that the \" man is rising in the world\"\u2014 the expression was afterwards reported to Foote ; who, in return, gave out, that he would produce the Caliban of literature on the stage \u2014 Johnson, being informed of this design, sent word to Foote, \" that the theatre being intended \" for the reformation of vice, he would step from \" the boxes on the stage, and correct him before the \" audience \" \u2014 Foote knew the intrepidity of his antagonist, and abandoned the design \u2014 no ill-will ensued \u2014 Johnson used to say \" that for broad-faced \" mirth, Foote had not his equal.\" (Murphy.) As a Dramatic Writer Foote stands very high \u2014 his Comedies have little or no plot, which is a great deficiency ; but his dialogue is superiour to that of most other authors ; it abounds with wit, humour, and satire ; and is peculiarly terse and well adapted to the stage ; seldom is there a superfluous word, or one that could be changed for the better he boldly attacked vice in the higher orders of life, and his plays contain a history of the follies, customs and corruptions of the age in which he lived \u2014 he cared not whether the object of his Satire was in high or low life, provided the peculiarities were prominent enough, and the person well known\u2014 by his death the public lost a great check on fashionable vice and"], [618, "608 HAY. 1777. folly\u2014it is but justice to Foote to say, that tho' he sometimes turned an inoffensive person into ridicule (for instance Mr. Apreece) yet he seldom or never made a severe attack on any character that either met with public respect, or deserved to do so \u2014 if Sir Matthew Mite, Lady Kitty Crocodile, Dr. Squintum and Dr. Simony were not fair objects of Comic Sa tire, in the name of fortune who ever was ? As Foote has ridiculed Physic and Law in the Devil upon Two Sticks and the Lame Lover, so he would probably have dedicated one play to the service of the Church, but that he was well aware that such a play would not be suffered to be acted \u2014 it is how ever to be wished that he had done it ; provided he had done it judiciously and not treated the Clergy worse than he has done the Physicians and the Lawyers, for no respectable person in either of these two professions need take offence at the Devil upon Two Sticks or the Lame Lover.

There was another peculiarity in the old Comedy \u2014 the persons who constituted the Chorus sometimes came forward, and addressed the audience \u2014 in these"], [631, "bath 1776-1777. 621 addresses the Poets either made an apology for them selves, or spoke about public affairs\u2014 these occasional addresses did not survive the Democracy. (Plato nius.J The works of Eupolis and Cratinus have perished, so that the nature of the old Comedy can only be known from Aristophanes\u2014 Brunck published his edition of Aristophanes in 1783\u2014 he calls Aristo phanes the most ingenious writer of all antiquity, and the most perfect pattern of the Attic dialect \u2014 he observes that no one can rightly understand the jokes, the drollery, and the wit of Aristophanes without reading him in Greek \u2014 Brunck himself has made the difficulty of reading Aristophanes in Greek vastly less than it was. Brunck observes in his preface \u2014 \" I think that no \" one, who has made the trial, can be ignorant how \" easily it may happen that a person in transcribing \" may distinctly see what is before his eyes, and \" yet, through a momentary absence of mind, write \" something else.\" BATH 1776-1777.
