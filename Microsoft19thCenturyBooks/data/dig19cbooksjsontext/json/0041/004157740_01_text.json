ADVERTISEMENT. The first Number of the Antiquities of Shropshire is published under circumstances which vary considerably from those under which the work was originally contemplated, and a second advertisement becomes necessary. The annexed Subscription List, though highly satisfactory in respect of the classes of names which it contains, is inadequate in point of extent to the mere cost of printing and publishing. The first Number is therefore issued for the sake of determining the Author's doubts, as to whether there is any general wish for such a publication. Should the answer be in the negative, the Author will neither forget his obligation to present Sub scribers, nor the explanation which he will further owe them if the work be discontinued. On the other hand, and with a view to continuance, several remarks and inquiries must be noticed. The objection, grounded on the length of time which is proposed to be occupied in publication, can be met, if generally wished, by a more speedy issue of numbers. The work will extend at least to five volumes, or twenty parts, and, according to the present plan, will be completed in not less than five years. Any Subscriber will be at liberty to withdraw his name, by giving notice to that effect within one month after the publication of any fourth part, or completed volume. Three hundred copies of Part I have been printed ; but the number of the future parts will be limited to those subscribed for within the next three months. Subscribers' Names may be sent, as heretofore, to Mr. B. L. Beddow, Bookseller, Shiffnal, Salop, with directions as to forwarding copies to the proper address. 1st December, 1853."], [20, "LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS. Aeton, Sir John Dalberg, Bart., Aldeuham.

ASEv.* \u00b1N deciding on a plan for the present work, the author has felt his greatest difficulty to exist in producing that combina tion1 which, wlrile it need not offend the mere antiquary, may also be attractive and useful to those local readers, who feel a pride or an interest in the County to which they belong. Large in extent,2 important in position, rich in fertility and productions, beautiful and varied in scenery, Shropshire has ever been inhabited by a race of men characteristic for uni formity of principle and energy of action. Great in its antecedents, and not unfortunate in its present, it may be no bad omen of its future, that those who have chief concern in its welfare be the slowest of all men to adopt any theory which identifies patriotism with a contempt of the past. Much does the antiquary congratulate himself in having chosen a field of research which promises such unusual ad- vantages of encouragement and sympathy. The present series of volumes on Shropshire Antiquities will relate mainly to the interval which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the death of Henry III. or unexpressible in another language. In the latter case aU contractions have been resolved. 1 The documents which furnish nearly aU the knowledge we possess of the earlier Anglo-Norman period are written in base Latin : the use of contracted forms is also general, though the forms themselves are various, no two scribes employing exactly the same. Translations more or less lite ral have therefore been given in the text, whilst the original has been added in a note, wherever its meaning was doubtful 2 Shropshire, with the exception of WUtshire, is the largest of the inland counties of Great Britain. Its limits wiU have somethne been greatly in excess of that county. Its ancient position, on a hostUe frontier, is that more particularly aUuded to in the text."], [30, "2 PREFACE. That period involved two centuries of years, a succession of eight Kings, and the lives of six generations of Princes of the Norman dynasty. The contemporary Chronicles are not numerous, but where ever their aid has been available for the present work, they have been consulted. Their testimony is however seldom of local interest, as none of them, except Ordericus, had any connexion with Shropshire, and his was chiefly that of birth. As regards national records, a short account of those which have reference to the period must be given, if only in expla nation of the more summary mode of citing them which will be adopted in the sequel. Domesday Book, or at least its general character, is known to all. This great territorial record was compiled by itinerant commissioners, in the years. 1085-6, and the result of their labours returned into the King's Court at Winchester, in the Easter of the latter year. Its evidence in regard to Shropshire is most satisfactory, whether we apply such external tests as remain to us, or look to the better guarantee of internal con sistency. The printed edition is a very creditable facsimile of the original, at least as far as this county is concerned. The national record, which comes next, both in point of date and importance, is the series of Pipe Rolls. The earliest of these Rolls is of the 31st year of Henry I (a.d. 1130), but unfortunately any portion thereof relating to Shropshire is either lost or never existed. The next Roll belonged to the 1st year of Henry II, but it is lost, and its former existence is only known by its having been epitomized by a later officer3 of the Exchequer. The Pipe Rolls, from the 2d year of Henry II, to the end of the period with which we are concerned, still contain all that was ever entered4 on them relative to Shrop- 3 Alexander de Swereford \u2014 who, at the time he made this abstract, viz. a.d. 1230, was Archdeacon of Salop (Lichfield dio cese) . 4 It is a very usual subject of regret amongst antiquaries, that the Pipe Roll of 1 Henry III is lost from the series ; such regret might be extended to the Roll of 18 John as well as to the Roll of the latter half of King John's 17th regnal year ; though the absence of these seems not to have been observed. It is probable how-"], [31, "3 PREFACE. shire. They are the accounts of the sheriffs of counties, of that revenue for which each was annually responsible at the King's Exchequer, and they include statements of the ex penses of those officers in the Royal service. The Record, commonly called the Liber Niger, or Black Book of the Exchequer, is mainly the result of an order made in the year 1165, or beginning of 1166, on every tenant in capite of the Crown, to return a list before the first Sunday of Lent (March 17th, 1166), of all who held under him by knight's service, stating whether such tenure was of old or of new feoffment, that is, whether it had existed from the days of Henry I, or had arisen since. Subject to this order, there was a return made and enrolled of the following Shropshire baronies, viz.: that of Fitz-Alan, Castle Holgate, Clun, and Lacy, and of some tenures of less extent ; but we miss from the record any statement of the Domesday Baronies of Corbet, Mortimer, Say of Richard's Castle,5 and several other lesser, but then existent fiefs. Hearne's printed transcript of this document is unusually faithful as regards Shropshire, but several entries are distinguished in the original, by being written in a different hand and paler ink than the general matter.

The Rotuli Literarum Patentium, or Patent Rolls, are copies ever, that, owing to the disturbed state of the kingdom at the time, the business of the Exchequer was totaUy suspended, and consequentlythat these Rolls never existed. The Shropshire Pipe RoUs of the pre ceding and subsequent years supply some evidence of this fact which wiU be stated hereafter.

Hearne's reading thereof is, how ever, so incorrect as to leave it unintelli gible. (See Hearne's Liber Niger, vol. i, pp. 159, 217.)

These writs have usually a public address or direction as to their execution, though they may treat of the concerns of an individual. They comprise documents on every variety of subject, \u2014 prerogative, revenue, judicature, treaties, safe-conduct, liberties, offices, wardships, ecclesiastical dignities, pardons, liveries, licences, creations of nobility, &c. They exist no earlier than for the third regnal year of King John (commencing May 3d, 1201), and from that time down wards, but not in quite an uninterrupted succession. The Rotuli Literarum Clausarum, or Close Rolls, were writs of the Crown, which were folded up, sealed on the outside, and usually addressed to individuals. Their subject was as diversified as that of the Patent Rolls. They exist from the sixth year of John (June 1204), but not continuously. The Rotuli Chartarum are the contemporaneous registers of Royal Grants of lands, dignities, liberties, and privileges. They commence with the first year of Khig John (a. d. 1199), and, with the exception of a few years, are preserved for the whole period with which we are concerned. The Oblata and Fine Rolls constitute one series, commencins: at the same period as the last. They are records of sums of money offered to and accepted by the Crown, when a subject had to negociate any favour or feudal right. The Placita and Assize Rolls are records of proceedings in the Courts of Law. No arrangement of these Rolls, founded on a distinct principle, has yet been made, and it is not easy to devise a plan for such arrangement. In general they are badly and inaccurately written, and ill preserved. More than half also are lost. Those which remain are, nevertheless, of the greatest importance, as containing information which no other source can supply. They contain minutes of trials both civil and criminal ; at Westminster, and in the provinces ; before the King himself, his council, and his justiciars.

Nothing whatever remains of this kind which can be attributed to an older date than the reign of Richard I. \u00b0 *_\u25a0 The Pedes Finium, or Final Concords, are records of the terms on which any real or fictitious suit at law was compounded between the litigants. These documents are supposed to have been originally in triplicate. A copy was allotted to each of the according parties, whilst the third was retained as a record by the Crown. Their preservation is extremely acci dental, but a few remain of the time of Henry II. Copies of many are preserved in Monastic chartularies, and other depo sitories, the originals of which are no longer existent in the proper custody. The Escheat Rolls, otherwise called Inquisitiones post mortem, are chiefly records of the writs addressed by the Crown to the proper officer, to summon a jury when the death of any tenant in capite involved a right of wardship, or marriage, or a fine by such tenant's successor for livery. The returns of these juries also form part of the Record, and usually contain statements as to the extent and value of the deceased's pro perty, its tenure, and the name and age of his heir. In some cases the writ is lost,6 whilst the return is extant, and vice versa. But these Rolls only commence in the reign of Henry III, and even then are not well preserved.

By Chart\u00e6 Antiqu\u0153 are generally understood, those copies of certain ancient charters which are enrolled at the Tower. These are not all royal charters. Similar documents existent at the British Museum and elsewhere, and to which the same title would be equally applicable, shall be described when quoted hereafter, by the place of their custody. The Red Book of the Exchequer {Liber Ruber Scaccarii), a volume of great interest and most varied contents, was com piled previous to the year 1246. When quoted in this work, it will be so as a collection of scutage-rolls, of lists of knights' fees and serjeantries, and of abstracts of Pipe Rolls. The Testa de Nevill is also a compilation of similar matters. As regards Shropshire it contains lists of tenures by serjeantry, of other tenures in capite, of the knights' fees constituting particular baronies, also notices 7 of churches, wardships or marriages of the King's gift, and scutages. These documents are of the reigns of John and Henry III. The Hundred Rolls for Shropshire are of two kinds, and relate to two periods, viz., the years 1255 and 1274. The former is chiefly a territorial record, specifying the tenure and extent of each manor in a given Hundred,8 its privileges and liabilities as ascertained by Jury. The latter is an inquisition by similar Juries of Hundreds as to frauds on the Crown Revenue, or oppressions of the people by public officers. The Placita de quo warranto were legal proceedings insti tuted by the Crown with reference to frauds thus or otherwise ascertained or suspected. A series of such trials was held in Shropshire in time of Edward I. The Forest Rolls, preserved at the Chapter-House, West minster, contain pleas and proceedings before the Justices of the King's Forests in their respective circuits. Mixed with 7 A part of these transcripts is clearly taken from Assize RoUs.

The originalia Rolls seem to be a series of memoranda of matters connected with the constant or casual revenue of the Crown. They were preserved in the Lord Treasurer's Re membrancer's Office, as belonging to that department of the Exchequer called the Exchequer of Account. They commence with the 11th year of Henry III (a.d. 1226). A book commonly called Kirby's Quest,10 and of which the original and constituent documents are supposed to be lost, seems to contain a series of extracts from the Escheat Rolls ; but its more valuable and distinctive feature is a state ment of tenures in different Counties and Hundreds, as they existed in time of Edward I. The survey of Shropshire is very full, and stands a most valuable continuation of the series formed by Domesday, the Liber Niger, the Testa de Nevill, and the Hundred Rolls. In further continuation of this series there was a record of the time of Edward II, commonly called the Nomina vil larum. The contents of this are similarly to be gathered only from transcripts, and those very inaccurate. A few minor records remain to be noticed. The Rotuli de given on the RoU itself. It was Thomas Fitz-Bernard. (Mag. Rot. Pip. 26 Hen. II, Salopescr.) 9 This date is proved in a curious but most satisfactory way. At the foot of the Roll, the sum of amercements levied on this occasion is stated as \u00a35S 4s. 6.., and an additional sum of \u00a355 is entered as accruing from the sale of lead, the pro duce of the King's mines at Shelve. In his account for the fiscal year ending Michaelmas, 1180, Hugh Pantulf, then Sheriff of Shropshire, acknowledges each of these sums as due to the Crown, and he discharges the debt in subsequent years. The Sheriff's account further sup plies the name of the justice of the forest who held these pleas, and which is not 10 John de Kirkby, whose name is asso ciated with these inquests, was treasurer to King Edward I at the time they were taken.

II). Shrop shire was not thus visited, but we obtain information as to certain persons connected with the County, and which, as relating to so remote a period, it would be vain to expect elsewhere. The Liberate Rolls are entries of the different precepts which were in fact the warrants of the fiscal Officers of the Crown in their payment of pensions, stipends, and other state expenses, constant or occasional. They remain of the 2d, 3d, and 5th years of John, when their matter becomes involved in the Close Rolls, and they are discontinued. They recom mence in the tenth year of Henry III, and continue till the reign of Henry VI. The Mis\u00e6 Rolls are accounts of the daily expenses of the King's Court. Only two exist, those of the 11th and 14th years of John. The Pr\u0153slita Rolls were records of advances out of the Royal Treasury for a specific purpose, or on loan. They exist only for five years of John, viz.: the 7th, 12th, 14th, 1 5th, and 16th years of his reign. With regard to ecclesiastical matters and possessions, there are no national records of the early date contemplated in this work, at least none of an exclusively ecclesiastical character. But whereas documents of a later period have, where places rather than persons are concerned, a wide retrospective signi ficance, I shall frequently quote certain national records, which treat of the temporal and spiritual possessions of the Church. The principal of these will be three : \u2014 1st, Pope Nicholas' Taxation, a survey and valuation taken between a.d. 1288 and 1292, on occasion of Pope Nicholas IV having granted in the former year, to King Edward I, the tenths of all ecclesiastical income in England for six years to come. These annual tenths were usually payable to the See of Rome, though in a previous instance they had been granted,"], [37, "9 PREFACE. for three years, to King Henry III. Tlie object for which Edward I was to employ them was a Crusade. His tem porary interest in the matter occasioned a Royal Commission, which surveyed the Church's possessions throughout the realm ; and this valuation governed all ecclesiastical taxes, whether payable to King or Pope, till the reign of Henry VIII. It was in fact the Domesday of the Church, and from it we not unfrequently get the earliest notice of our parochial existence and relations. \u2014 2dly. The Record printed under the title Inquisitiones Nonarum, or Inquests of the Ninths, purporting to be a valua tion taken a.d. 1341, through every parish in the kingdom, of the ninth of certain stock in such parish. This tax was the country contingent of a general subsidy granted by parlia ment in support of the wars of King Edward III. The ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, in a parish, was expected to equal the ecclesiastical valuation of glebe, and tithes in general ; so that Pope Nicholas' taxation was in effect the basis of the cal culation : but this assessment was made in each case by a jury of parishioners, and where their return differed from the taxation, they stated the local or temporary causes which pro duced the discrepancy. Hence the Record embodies a variety of local and statistical information, quite accidental to a fiscal documeut. \u2014 3dly. The Valor Ecclesiasticus, or great Ecclesiastical Valua tion of Henry VIII, which had its origin in this way. When the King had succeeded in depriving the Papal See of all revenue derivable from his realm of England, his next care was to secure to himself, in some form or other, the income thus disengaged. The Parliament which met on 3d Nov., 26 Henry VIII (a.d. 1534), granted to the Crown the annual tenth of all ecclesiastical income whatsoever. The institution thereupon of a Royal Commission, or Commissions, resulted in the general valuation before us. This Record is printed in six folio volumes, and Mr. Hunter's Introduction, embodied in the sixth volume, is an able account of many further particulars."], [38, "10 PREFACE. The whole or parts of other Records, above described, have been printed, chiefly by order of the late Record Commission, whose powers seem to have been withdrawn precisely at the time when they were in most efficient exercise. When a docu ment is quoted in the following pages, which has been thus well edited, reference will often be made to the page of the printed book, rather than to the original folio or membrane. I cannot dismiss this notice of the public Records of the kingdom, which, according to the liberal system adopted by the present Master of the Rolls, I have had the privilege of consulting or transcribing free of expense, without expressing my sense of the ready and accommodating spirit with which the Officers of each department have facilitated my researches. Something of this is, I understand, the result of general directions ; but I speak of a uniform civility and readiness to assist, which is not required, and could not be enforced by any system of rules. Passing now from national Records to those of a more local character, the first which have to be mentioned are the Dio cesan Registers. These, unfortunately, do not much affect the period with which we are chiefly concerned. The Lichfield Registers commence with that of Bishop Walter de Langton, who was consecrated 22d Dec., 1296 : the Hereford Regis ters, with that of Bishop Thomas de Cantilupe, consecrated 8th Sept., 1275. The former I have had every facility for consulting, through the united kindness of the Bishop, the Registrar, and Deputy- Registrar of the Diocese. I had already extracted the Shrop shire entries of the three earlier11 Registers when my progress 11 The Harleian MSS. 3868 and 4799, now in the British Museum, and some time in possession of Peter le Neve, were un doubtedly, at a still earlier period, part of the Diocesan Registers of Lichfield. They contain documents of extreme antiquity and interest. They are not, like the later Registers, continuous records of the Dio cesan transactions, hut appear rather to be enrolments of certain documents exhi- bited at Episcopal visitations, in proof of various rights and titles to Church pro perty. Duplicates of many .entries are to be found in Monastic Chartularies, but where the latter are lost or inaccessible, the information supplied hy these Registers is invaluable. Further, on fly-leaves or other (origi nally) vacant spaces of the first Lichfield Registers have been transcribed a few"], [39, "PREFACE. 11 was stopped, not immediately, because the Registers refer to a period later than that in hand, but from finding that the work had been already done by another. All extracts neces sary to a County History, and which the Registers either of Lichfield or Hereford could supply, were taken by the late Rev. J. B. Blakeway, and may be found among his MSS. in the Bodleian Library. Of Monastic Chartularies, there are four only known to be in existence, which relate to the greater religious houses of Shropshire. They are of Shrewsbury, Haughmond, and Lilles hall Abbeys, and of.Wombridge Priory. The Shrewsbury and Wombridge Chartularies are in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart., of Middle Hill, Worcestershire, whose liberality in allowing access to his valuable collections is too well known to need mention here. Eor my knowledge of the contents of these two Chartularies I am however indebted to Mr. George Morris, of Shrewsbury, whose extracts from them, while in the hands of a former owner, have been obligingly lent me, and are amply sufficient for my present purpose. The Haughmond Chartulary, in possession of Andrew William Corbet, of Sundorn, Esq., is open to my inspection, through permission of its owner ; but Mr. Morris's extracts have similarly been avaflable to me, and contain all that I can at present wish to derive from this source. There is a fragment of a different Chartulary of Haughmond in the British Museum, which, with many other documents there, I have either copied or carefully consulted. To the Lilleshall Chartulary and other documents in pos session of his Grace the Duke of Sutherland, I have also leave of access ; but the references, which I am at present enabled to make to the former, are by means of extracts taken long since, and to be found in the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and the Diocesan Registers. documents, or possibly by the spontaneous dUigence of some clerk anxious to rescue the remains of an earUer and perishing Record. charters of much earUer date than the general contents of the series.

The Chartularies of Wenlock Priory, and of Buildwas Abbey, are lost, or, at least, have not been heard of in this country since the dissolution. Of the former, a few items may be gathered from the Monasticon and other quarters. The loss of the latter may be much more satisfactorily supplied from various sources. It is not impossible that a connected Chartulary of either house may yet be found in some foreign depository. Some inquiries in that direction have however been hitherto unsuccessful. For assistance in the loan of private deeds and documents, I must leave all detailed acknowledgment to the sequel, and I have reason to anticipate considerable aid of this kind from several sources. Already I have received valuable contribu tions from the Rev. J. Brooke, of Haughton; R. H. Cheney, Esq., of Badger; R. Gardner, Esq., of Leighton ; and W. W. How, Esq., of Shrewsbury. 12 I omit to particularize several promises of most efficient aid in the illustrative department of this work, simply lest some unforeseen hindrance may occur to one or other of my expect ations. I must be similarly guarded as to some architectural notices which I have hope of obtaining from a well-known authority 13 in such matters. My business here is merely to disclaim all personal credit for either kind of contribution. Maps will be given which will follow the territorial arrange ment of Domesday, as far as that can now be ascertained, 12 I have further to add to this hst of benefactors, the names of the Rt. Hon. Lord Forester, Sir Baldwin Leighton, Bart., T. C. Whitmore, Esq., W. Wolryche Whitmore, Esq., and George Pritchard, Esq., who have given me every facUity for consulting and transcribing documents in their possession. At WiUey is a register of Wenlock Priory, chiefly in the handwriting of the two Priors, who preceded John Bay lis, the last who enjoyed that dignity. The volume is extremely valuable, not only as furnishing in its various rent-roUs much of topograpliical information, but as containing several earlier documents transcribed, I presume, with reference to some current question of title or prescriptive right. 13 The Rev. J. L. Petit,\u2014 who already favours me in a way which I must acknow ledge both gratefully and openly.

The tables of Domesday Hundreds which will accompany these maps, are intended further to illustrate the state of things at the time of that survey. With regard to former works on the same or cognate sub jects, I shall have most frequent occasion to refer to \u2014 The History of Shrewsbury, in 2 vols. (1825), by the late Veil. Archdeacon Owen, and the late Rev. J. B. Blakeway. The Sheriffs of Shropshire (1831), a posthumous work of the Rev. J. B. Blakeway. And to the Antiquities of Shropshire (1844), by T. F. Dukes, Esq. I shall not hesitate to borrow from these works whatever I may find in them necessary to the completeness or illustra tion of the subject in hand ; but it is more with reference to objections which I shall have to make to some of their con tents that I wish here to speak and to apologize. The self reliance which such objections may be construed to imply will only be apparent, for of all names associated with our local history and antiquities that of Mr. Blakeway has ever seemed to me entitled to an increasing reverence. The History of Shrewsbury, the joint work of himself and Archdeacon Owen, is, I imagine, of the very highest order of excellence ; and that not merely topographically, but as furnishing those very elements towards a general History of England which ought to be ready and available to the national historian, whenever one competent to the greater undertaking shall arise. The objections which I speak of are then only to matters of detail, on which it is impossible for one person at any one time to attain perfect accuracy. Herein Dugdale himself, though ignorantly criticised in his day, was no exception to the general rule, that antiquarian truth must be progressive, and so never complete. The smallest change of premises will often largely affect a conclusion, and a dozen established facts assume a totally new complexion, by the addition of one hitherto uncertified. I close this digression with a simple"], [42, "14 PREFACE. acknowledgment which I trust will excuse reiterated apologies in the sequel. It is only where some further fact, apparently unknown to Mr. Blakeway, may happen to occur to me, or where my greater leisure, and more limited sphere of inquiry may enable me to devote much attention to points, which in his varied researches he was obliged to treat summarily, that I would venture to express a difference of opinion. I have one more profession to make. It is as to the limits which I propose between an indulgence in conjecture, and an avoidance of difficulties. The former is the stigma of the old school of heralds and antiquaries ; the latter is more likely to be the error of modern inquirers. And the reason of both is apparent. The former expected and gained everything by flattery and invention ; the latter write under surveillance of a searching, if not over-active, spirit of criticism. Conjecture is to be avoided till all available resources of knowledge have been exhausted, but any attempt to solve a still remaining difficulty is excusable ; and an acknowledgment of a difficulty, wherever one occurs, is a duty, even though it may provoke a suspicion of ignorance unfavourable to the author. A diffi culty evaded is only a difficulty postponed ; but a difficulty confessed is a mark for future inquiry, more skilful, more active, or more fortunate, than the one in hand. I cannot conclude without some acknowledgment of what I owe to a Society of living Antiquaries, whose writings I shall frequently have recourse to, and the very mention of whose names is a condemnation of that wretched economy which suspended the operations of the Record Commission, and so deprived the public of services which may never again be at command. Some personal obligations, and a wish to avoid all appearance of flattery, prevent my saying more in con nexion with the names of Sir Francis Palgrave, Thomas Duffus Hardy, Esq., and the Rev. Joseph Hunter. I am not so withheld in speaking of the works of the late Thomas Stapleton, Esq., my extreme admiration of which, as it is associated with no personal feeling, so can it no longer wear"], [43, "15 PREFACE. even an appearance of flattery. His commentary on the Rotuli Normanni\u0153 is a model of antiquarian criticism ; and mention of that particular work is less out of place here, because it contains the only correct accounts of two great families early connected with Shropshire, those of its Norman Earls and of the Mortimers. And now, having taken full advantage of that license to speak in the first person which is usually allowed to a Preface, I commit my work to the indulgence of its readers, little doubting that a liberality, kindred to that which has already welcomed an unknown author with a subscription list of more than a hundred names, will double that number, and be yet further extended to a judgment of his labours when published.

The foregoing Map is chiefly intended to show the Domesday divisions of that part of the County with which our survey begins. It contains two entire Shropshire Hundreds, viz., Alnodestreu and Patinton ; and the Domesday Manors, forming, or probably forming, each of these Hundreds, are printed in two different colours (red and green). There was also a Shropshire Hundred of Bascherch at the time of Domesday, the bulk of which lay north and north-west of Shrewsbury, and so, very distant from the quarter of our present inquiries. But this Hundred had two detachments, curiously involved in different parts oi Alnodestreu Hundred. The Manors forming each of these detachments are printed in a third colour (blue). The County of Salop now contains several Manors which at the time of the Norman Survey were members of other Counties. Some of these must come under early consideration. Such of them as contributed, iu 1086, to form the Staffordshire Hundred of Saisdone, are printed in a fourth colour (yellow) ; such as were members of the more distant Warwickshire Hundred of Stanlei, in a fifth colour (brown). Lest, at this early stage, the allegation of such eccentric divisions should provoke- ta suspicion of inaccuracy, it is better to state that they can all be accounted for, and exactly on the same principle as that which Dugdale laid .down long ago, when he met with similar ph\u00e6nomena in his Survey of Warwickshire. An explanation in each instance will be offered in its proper place. Lastly, names marked on the Map in black ink are. of five different classes, viz. :\u2014 1st.

Such are the terms Much and Little prefixed to the two Wenlocks \u2014 George and BurneU affixed to the two Eudons ; and so forth. 2dly.

These land-marks, more or less enduring, are necessary to any Map, and their names, wherever printed, are only meant to render the whole intelligible. In these cases, and for the same purpose, the modern name is employed. For instance, the Brown Clee Hill is so printed, though I suppose one part of that name to be extremely recent. Not so the Wrekin, whose modern name is but a revival, after some disuse, of its oldest appellation.

Whereas, in the foregoing Map, the modern orthography has been substituted for that of Domesday, the 1st column of the annexed Table supplies the latter, as far as this Hundred is con cerned. The 2d column gives the Saxon owner of each Manor in time of King Edward the Confessor \u2014 T. R. E. (as Domesday abbreviates \" Tempore Regis Edwardi.\") The 3d column gives the tenant in capite of 1086, who, in Alnodestreu Hundred, was uniformly the Norman Earl (Roger de Montgomery) . The 4th column gives the tenant or tenants holding, in 1086, immediately under the Earl, and whether individual or corporate. If the Earl held the whole or part of the Manor in demesne, and had therefore no tenant, such fact is marked in this column by a horizontal line. The 5th column gives the under-tenant (holding under the Earl's tenant), where any such is named in Domesday. The 6th column enumerates certain features or adjuncts of some Domesday Manors, often useful as evidence of identity, such as Churches, Priests, Provosts, Berewicks,1 Mills, and Woods. The 7th column gives the Domesday hidage of each Manor, that is, such capacity as each Manor was rated at for the assessment called Danegeld. Sometimes a portion of this hidage is stated in Domesday to be free from that impost (non gildabilis), but this exemption does not occur in Alnodestreu Hundred. The Domesday hidage of Manors is very important, as it formed the basis of later taxes than the Danegeld, and so is often a guide in questions of identity. The Domesday hide of this Hundred is computed \" at 240 acres of the period; the virgate (or yard-land) of the same Record at 60 acres.

The 10th and last column gives the modern name of each Manor, as in the Map ; but where doubt exists as to identity, such doubt is marked by a note of interrogation after the surmised name. If the identity cannot even be surmised, the same note occupies the space alone. The whole contents of the Domesday Hundred are added together at the foot of the table; but this is in prospect of a future question, to the solution of which such calculations will contribute their share."], [54, "aino&tsmu Hunfcreti, This Hundred, variously written by the Norman1 Scribes of Domesday as that of Elnoestrul, Elnoelstruil, Elnoelstrui, Elnoel stui, or Alnodestreu, owed the latter part of its name, perhaps, to a vill or tre of British origin, whereat in succeeding times some Saxon \u00c6lnoth may have presided as Ealdorman, over the folkmote or hundred- court of the district. The locality of such a British vill cannot now be surmised, as probably its existence, and certainly its conjectured importance, had ceased before the days of King Edward the Confessor. In his reign (a.d. 1042-1065), the Hundred of Alnodestreu had its centre or caput at Membrefeld (Morville), where consequently that local jurisdiction will have been exercised which, together with the Manor, realized an annual revenue of _\u00a310. The proportion between the Curial and Manorial income is not stated in Domesday ; but two-thirds of the former, whatever it was, belonged to the Crown, and thc other third to the Earl of Mercia. When in the year 1086, the Domesday Survey was taken, the collective value of Morville Manor and its attached Hundred of Alnodestreu was a little in excess of the Saxon valuation, viz. .\u20ac10. 8*. 6d. The Norman Earl (Roger de Montgomery) was now entitled to the whole profits2 of the hundred-court, which are 1 The Domesday Commissioners for Worcestershire and other, probably ad joining, Counties, were Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, Earl Walter Giffard, Henry de Ferrers, and Adam, brother of Eudo the King's Sewer. \u2014 (Cotton MSS., Tib. ... xiij.)

But I suppose that Earl Roger's tenure in Shropshire was like that of the Earl of Chester in his County, and will be-t be described by the term palatine. The chief features of such tenure were, that the judicial revenue of County, Hundred, and Borough Courts was not, as in Saxon, or as in subsequent times, divided between the Crown and the Earl in proportion of two to one, but belonged wholly to the Earl. Pleas of the Crown, therefore, did 2 In the age immediately succeeding that of which we are treating, the distinc tive badge of Earldom was a right to a third part of the revenue arising from such pleas of the Crown as were held in the"], [55, "ALNODESTREU HUNDRED. 23 estimated at \u00a33, but that sum probably included the income of such portion of the Manor as was retained by the Earl in demesne. As regards the boundaries of the Domesday Hundred of Alnode streu, they will best be understood by a perusal of the accompany ing Map. It lay in a scattered form, being broken up by isolated portions of the Hundreds of Bascherch and Patinton ; nor was this a solitary instance of those eccentric territorial divisions which at the period in question must have been productive of great iucon venience. A thorough change in this respect was effected in Shropshire before the accession of Henry II (1154), but by which of his four predecessors cannot be determined on positive evidence. There are however some negative considerations, which it may be worth while to offer on the matter. The reigns of William Rufus and Stephen were not likely to have been productive of any great internal reforms of this kind. The last two years of William the Conqueror (or such part of two years as elapsed between the completion of the Domesday record and his death), left him little leisure for English affairs, to say nothing of the County of Salop being at that time exempt from all subsidiary exercise of royal prerogative. On other grounds such a reform might have been expected, almost as a corollary of the Domesday Survey ; but then it would hardly have escaped the notice of those contemporary Chroniclers, who have dwelt so much on the adjuncts of that great territorial record. King Henry I inherited much of the administrative ability of his Father. Thirty years of his reign were years of uninterrupted tranquillity as regarded this County. His powers of interference in all its internal affairs were unlimited, and his ministers were men of great capacity and energy. To his reign then may be ascribed the change, which rearranged the divisional system of the County, as well as its external boundaries. The feature of this change, which we have at present to do with, is, that the Hundred of Alnodestreu was swept away, and came to summary remedy, till Tie had been tried by his peers, or refused to undergo such trial after due summons. not exist in Earl Roger's principality. Similarly, no writ of the King' would be cognizable, or, as the term went, \"current\" in any lands of Earl Roger's tenure, except the \" writ close,\" i. e., addressed to the Earl himself. Against a subject thus powerful, in case he were refractory or rebellious, the King had no legal and Thus the fealty which the Earl of Shrewsbury owed to the King of England was much what was claimed from the latter, as Duke of Normandy, by the King of France. 1"], [56, "24 ALNODESTREU HUNDRED. be represented by portions of the Hundred of Stottesden, Brimstree, and Munslow, none of which had any existence at Domesday. A second but more partial change in the reign of Richard I assigned that part of Alnodestreu Hundred, which meanwhile had been in Munslow Hundred, and one Manor (Badger), which had similarly been in Brimstree Hundred, to the then newly-created liberty of Wenlock. In the latter case (the assignment of Badger to Wenlock liberty), the anomaly produced was exactly of the kind which the first reform was clearly intended to remove. With regard to the Manors which appear on the face of the Domesday Record, as members of Alnodestreu Hundred, they are enumerated in the Table already given. Only one of them is of doubtful identity, viz. Etone. The Domesday Survey does not specify the Hundreds of many Manors, which were of the Norman Earl's demesne. A probability that four of these unclassified Manors were in the Hundred of Alnodestreu will be stated under their respective notices. A fifth Manor, similarly of the Earl's demesne, and written \" Bolebec \" in Domesday, is not identified, and therefore its position in this hundred is matter of the merest conjecture. A seventh Manor, \"Cerlecote,\" is assigned in the printed Domesday to the Hundred of \" Recordin ; \" nor is the original record in this instance misrepresented. It is nevertheless quite clear that such assignment was in the first case, a mere scribal in accuracy, which will be noticed in its proper place, and would not have been mentioned here, but to explain the appearance of the Manor of Charlcott in the annexed Map and Table of the Hundred of Alnodestreu."], [57, "ifflortottU. When the Domesday Survey was taken, the Manor of Membre felde remained, as in Saxon times, the caput or centre of the Hundred of Alnodestreu. Its relations in that respect have been already spoken of, and it remains further to describe its state as a Manor. Manorially then, at the time of Domesday, Morville was in a condition of uncompleted, but then meditated change. Beyond the transfers then contemplated, a lapse of twenty years brought about other changes of tenure and condition not then to be expected. No wonder then that a comparison of its Domesday state and limits with those of a subsequent date should involve much research in the first instance, some conjecture in the next, and perhaps little of positive conclusion in the last. Even the starting point \u2014 the evidence of Domesday as to this Manor, is in one respect obscure, in another false, and in a third silent. Much of this was doubtless a result of the condition 9s the Manor at the time ; but after thus deciding on the inadequacy of this paramount authority in the case in question, we have little other evidence to guide us except that which proves, though it does not correct, the errors of the greater record. That which Domesday 1 tells us consistently is as follows: \u2014 The whole Manor of Membrefelde contained twelve hides of land treu Hundredum. Duo denarii erant Regis Edwardi, et tercius Comitis. Inter totum reddebat x libros.

Of these twelve hides, we are told first, that the Norman Earl held four in demesne; but what appears to be a supplementary note, indicates that two out of the said four hides were held under the Earl by Richard Pincerna. The whole four had been, in the Confessor's time, of the King's demesne. The remaining eight hides had under the same Monarch formed the endowment of the Collegiate Church of St. Gregory of Mem brefelde, in which \" were ministering eight Canons.\" The Norman Earl had however undertaken the duty, or business, of remodelling this ecclesiastical foundation. He had granted the Church and five of the eight hides of land to his recent monastic establishment at Shrewsbury; with the other three hides he had beneficed his own private Chaplains. Summarily then, in 1086, the Earl held this Manor and hundred in capite of the Crown. Of the Manor he retained two hides in demesne ; two hides were held under him by Richard Pincerna, five by the Monks of Shrewsbury, and three by his own Chaplains. The relative value, cultivation, and occupation of these respective portions, may also be gathered from Domesday. In demesne (two hides) there were two ox-teams and work for six more. There were nine villains and six boors with three ox-teams, and there was a capability of maintaining two more ox-teams. There were also four neat-herds. The annual value of this, including however the revenue of the Hundred-Court, was j\u20ac3. The five hides, held by the Monks of Salop, employed in demesne two ox-teams, and might employ four more. But nine villains, one boor, and three priests, had nine teams thereon. There were also four neat-herds, and a Knight who held a whole hide under the Monks at a rent of four shillings per annum. The gross annual value of these five hides was \u00a33. 17s. As to the three hides which the Earl's Chaplains held, they were underlet to five freemen (homines) . There was arable land suffi cient for six ox-teams, but only two were in employ. The annual value of these three hides was \u00a33.

There was work for nine more such teams. Hereon also was a mill rendering ten horse-loads of grain. The whole tenure was worth 20s. annually. Here we may notice that the land requiring most team-labour was that assessed as least valuable ; also that the Monks applied more such labour to their tenement, in proportion to its require ments, than did the Chaplains, and the Chaplains more than the lay-tenant. The Earl's demesne cannot be brought into this calculation, owing to its precise value not being specified. It however required more team-labour than any of the other tenements, and received less in proportion to its requirements than the land of the Monks, but more than that of the others. Something must now be said of the locality of these respective tenures, a subject which will involve statements or surmises as to those eighteen berewicks, which were members of this Manor in 1086. Domesday itself supplies the name of one of these berewicks. It was \" Calveston, in Worcestershire.\" This item of Domesday geography, though suspected to be far from accurate, is useful in its way, as confirming our accounts - as to the mode in which that survey was taken. There can be little doubt that the locality indicated was Cold Weston, a township very far to the south-west of Morville, yet at least eight miles removed from the nearest point of Worcestershire. The names of eight more of these berewicks may be gathered from an early and important charter of Salop Abbey, described in the monastic index as the charter 3 of King William I, and indeed confirmed as such by King Edward III. \u2022 The Commissioners who travelled through the country to take the survey examined whom they chose ; such as Sheriffs, Barons, Reeves of Hundreds, Priests, Bailiffs, and even Villains, but the detailed information seems generally to have been derived from the answers of Jurors empanelled from each Hundred. Thus an inaccurate reply might very probably be given as to any locality which lay beyond the limits of the particular Hundred then under notice of the Coin- mission.\u2014 (Vide MSS. Cotton., Tib. A. yi, sol. 38.) 3 This charter stands No. 34 in the Abbey Chartulary, and as recited and confirmed by succeeding Kings, is given in the Patent Roll of 1 Hen. VI, part 5, memb. 19. The original Latin is printed in the New Monasticon, vol. iii, p. 521, numb, x ; and a comment on its nature and contents may be seen in the History of Shrewsbury, vol. ii, pp. 15-16. It is very common to hear the term"], [60, "28 MORVILLE These berewicks were as follows : Astley, Little Astley (alia Estleia), Norley, Crofte, Haughton, Kingslow, Harpsford, and Billingsley. The charter quoted also mentions the vill of Weston, which probably was only the Cold Weston mentioned above. It further describes some other \" possessions \" of the Church of Morville, viz, Newton, Tugford, and Fertecote; but, in so far as it \"forgery\" applied to these early charters, and the historians of Shrewsbury, usually most impartial, speak of \" the fabrication of charters\" and \"pretended charters\" as common things, and as applicable to the document before us. It is because the evidence afforded by these early charters is either exceedingly valuable or extremely delusive that I have given, at different times, great attention to the subject, and venture now to express an opinion in favour of their general honesty and truth, and condemnatory of all harsh terms what- soever as applied to them. The truth is, that a later age has misunderstood the very nature of these early charters, and has consequently judged of them by a false standard. The charter before us belongs to a class very common at the time, and which may be called \"recita- tory,\" and, if it may be allowed to speak for itself, will suggest the following idea of its formation. Certain persons in- terested in the welfare of Shrewsbury Abbey (the Abbot, perhaps, and one or two literate monks), think it expedient, both for the security of their titles, and as an incentive to future benefactors, to draw up a written statement of grants which, within their knowledge, have been made to their house. In this work they partly rely on then' own recollections, but chiefly on written documents which they have before them, and which relate to those benefactions iu detail. The extracts from these vouchers are easily distinguishable, in such documents, from the explanatory or connective words employed by the compilers. When the whole is finished, an opportunity is sought for sending the digest to the King's Court, in order to secure the royal confirmation. Perhaps the Abbot himself is going thither, as did Fulehered, first Abbot of Shrewsbury, to the Court of William Rufus, at Gloucester, in July 1100. The document is offered to the royal consideration, perhaps accom panied by vouchers, but more certainly with a pecuniary recommendation. The routine was, that the King laid it before his Council, or referred it to his Chan- cellor. On a favourable report thereof, the King directs the latter to affix the great seal, and perhaps a sentence ex- pressive of the royal concurrence. The distinguishing feature of this mode of proceeding was, that the charter confirmed was drawn up by the grantees, not by the grantors, nor yet by an officer of the Court. The probability is, however, that some test of good faith was supplied, such as the production of vouchers. At all events, these charters were very com- mon, and their efficacy admitted in the law courts of succeeding reigns, as well as in the great conveyancing department of Chancery. Such a document is No. 34 of the Salop Chartulary, and the critical mistake of the Shrewsbury historians is that they have treated it as a document in which they have assumed the King him- self to be the narrator throughout. Looking alone to the internal evidence of this document, I cannot omit to state a doubt whether the confirming sentence was by the Conqueror or his son Rufus. The monk who wrote the Index of the Salop Chartulary, more than 200 years after, attributed the deed to the former, and Edward Ill's inspeximus calls the King who confirmed, his \"progenitor,\" a term which literally could not apply to Rufus. Neither of these considerations would weigh with me against evidence of another kind, and that, which I think further affects the question, shall be offered in a place where it is more relevant to the text."], [61, "MORVILLE.. 29 describes them a3 possessions involved in Earl Roger's grant to Salop Abbey, it is probably in error as to circumstance. That at the time this charter was written, the Church of Morville had acquired an interest in each of those three vills is very likely, but that such interest was derived in two cases from other sources than Earl Roger's grant, and did not amount to possessions in the third, and that in none of the three was any interest of St. Gregory of Morville, so existent as to warrant our inclusion of them among the Domesday berewicks of that Manor, are matters which will have to be treated of under the respective titles of those townships. As yet, therefore, only eight of Morville's seventeen unnamed berewicks have been realized, with any show of certainty. Perhaps such places as Rode, Stanley, Dunvall, Colemore, may have been esteemed berewicks, and may be left under this conjectural head till in the following pages, they shall each receive a notice and the reader judge whether they or some others, such as Severn (now Severn Hall), Rucroft, Cantreyn, &c, best deserve a place among the uncertain berewicks of the Domesday summary. Five berewicks yet remain, and with something of a better title to be placed on this conjectural list. They are Underdon, Bridge walton, Lye, Tasley, and Henley. And now, to apportion a series of half-conjectured berewicks so as to tally with the inaccurate, or deficient, or superfluous statement of Domesday, is a matter of extreme difficulty, but yet a necessary part of our professed plan.* It must first be mentioned, that the three hides, which at the time oi Domesday were tenanted by Earl Roger's chaplains, had been by him granted in remainder to Shrewsbury Abbey, as part and parcel of the original Church of St. Gregory. This remainder was to, and did,*5 take effect after the deaths of the then incumbents. Of course it is impossible 6 to distinguish now between the five hides, which in 1086 had already gone to the Monks of Shrewsbury, and the three hides, which under the same grant were shortly to revert is quite a mistake. Meilnil Hermer is not the name of the Chaplain's prebend, but of himself, and it was very usual thus to insert a man's calling between the two parts of his name. So Ricardus Capel lanus de Meilnil Hermer means nothing more than Richard de Meilnil Hermer, Chaplain. Mesnil Hermer was a Norman 4 See Preface, page 14. 5 See page 32. 6 In the History of Shrewsbury (vol. ii, p. 22) one of these reversionary prebends is conjectured to have been \" Morville Home,\" and that Ricardus Capellanus de Meilnil Hermer, its supposed incumbent, was so entitled by some scribe ignorant of the meaning of \" Morville Home.\" This name."], [62, "30 . MORVILLE. to that Abbey. The collective eight hides may however be esti mated as thus involved : \u2014 One hide at Calveston (Coldweston) . Five hides in Astley, that is, in Astley Abbots and its adjuncts, viz. Little Astley, Nordley, Crofte, Haughton, Kingslow, Rode, Stanley, Dunvall, Colemore, Severn, Rucroft, Cantern, &c. One and a-half hides at Billingsley. Half a hide in Morville itself (including, perhaps, Harpswood) . Such then were the eight ecclesiastical hides, supposed to be implied by the five and three hides of the Domesday Survey. There are yet four hides to be allocated. These are stated in the first instance to be held by the Earl in demesne ; but two of them, in a notice which appears to be supplementary, are said to be the tenure of Richard Pincerna. To deal with the latter first, it must be submitted, that no two hides within any supposable area of Morville Manor ever descended as a tenure, immediately under the Earl (or his ultimate repre sentative, the Crown) to any imaginable heir of Richard Pincerna. But we know that Tasley was in the area of the Domesday Manor of Morville, that it has no distinctive notice in that record, and that it constituted a Manor of two hides at a later period. We also know that in its adjunct, Henley, Warin the Sheriff had a seignoral interest before Domesday, and that in the usual course of Warin's succession a correspondent interest to that which he had exercised appears, after Domesday, vested in Fitz-Alan, and this both in Henley and Tasley. At the intermediate period, viz. 1086, this interest was almost uniformly represented by Rainald, the Sheriff, Warin's successor and Fitz-Alan's antecessor : 7 yet Domesday .says nothing of Rainald being a tenant under the Earl anywhere in Morville Manor. It may therefore be presumed, that the two hides said to be held by Richard Pincerna immediately under the Earl were in Tasley and Henley, but that they were held by the said Richard, of Rainald the Sheriff, and by Rainald of the Earl. 8 7 1 use the word \"antecessor\" rather than \" ancestor\" advisedly, because we usually associate a descent by blood with the latter term, an idea which, in the present instance, would be erroneous. might have been under-tenant there.

To conclude with the two hides which, in 1086, were still of Earl Roger's demesne, they must be allocated as follows, that is to say, partly in Astley (if Hugh, son and successor to Earl Roger, be truly stated to have granted tithes of his demesne of Astley, to Salop Abbey) ; partly in Aldenham, Underdon, Bridgewalton, and Lye, and even in Morville itself, as will appear hereafter. Earl Roger's demesne in this Manor will also have extended in a direction which then had no specific name or occupancy. North ward of Morville, and surrounded by localities which either were members of Morville, or else had a distinctive notice in Domesday, there was a wide, barren rock, somewhat elevated above the sur rounding country in general, and naturally fortified on three sides by ravines and valleys of greater or less depth. On the fourth or eastern side, it overhung the channel of the river Severn, at a still more commanding height. This rock or platform, then so in significant, had once perhaps been the site of a Saxon fortress, but if so, its importance was only traditionary, and the fortress itself a ruin. Yet was this unnamed locality destined, within twenty years after Domesday, to become the scene of great local and national events. First, it was to be the site of a Castle of uncommon strength, the work of the last Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, whose engineering skill was as famous as his cruelty and ambition. Such a combination it was, which served to fortify Bridgnorth in a space of time otherwise incredibly short. The result proves how judiciously the site was selected, and how efficiently occupied, for there, within the same period of twenty years, the chief power 9 of the kingdom, though marshalled under the eye of an able and war like Monarch, was to receive a sturdy though temporary 10 check, from the foresight of the rebel Earl, and the valour of his depen dants. This spot, naturally unnoticed in Domesday, as part of the Earl's demesne in Morville Manor, will, in regard of its subsequent importance, demand a separate and more prominent notice in the sequel. Having now sketched the presumed area of the Domesday Manor of Morville, it is necessary to speak further of its details. \u2014 The chief feature here was The Church. 9 \"Totius Angli\u00e6 legiones\" are the words used by Ordericus. \u2014 (Vide Nor mannorum Scriptores, page 807 A.) 10 The siege of Bridgnorth lasted three weeks. \u2014 (Ordericus, ._\u00bb..)"], [64, "32 MORVILLE. THE CHURCH. A Collegiate Church of the usual Saxon character, I1 had existed at Morville in the days of King Edward the Confessor. It was in honour of St. Gregory. Its endowment was eight hides of land, and it was served by eight Canons. The forfeiture of the Saxon Earls, Morcar and Edwin, a. d. 1071, was probably in the first instance subversive of this foundation, but before a. d. 1086, the Norman Earl had devoted the whole of these possessions to an ecclesiastical purpose. He had bestowed the Church and five hides on Shrewsbury Abbey, and three hides on his domestic Chaplains ; but with a proviso as regarded the latter, \"that as fast as the Clerks (or life-tenants) died off, the Abbey should appropriate their Prebends.\" Thus undoubtedly did Shrewsbury Abbey become at some time possessed of the Church and eight hides which had formed thc Saxon establishment. We are fortunate in having a record of the lapse of one of these Prebends, and of some difficulty which the Abbey experienced in establishing its reversionary claim. Between the years 1108 and 1113, Richard de Meilnil Hermer, a Chaplain, died, having been first shorn a Monk of Salop. His son, Hubert, claimed his father's Prebend as his inheritance, but King Henry I enjoined Richard, Bishop of London, then Viceroy or Steward of this County, to hold trial thereupon. The consequence was the tjefeat of the claimant, the King himself apparently sitting in Court, and attended by the chief Barons of the County. We learn from this, that Earl Roger's Chaplain was, as might be ex pected, a Norman, Mesnil Hermer being a Norman town and giving name to a Norman family. It also would appear that celibacy was at this period either not incumbent on the Norman Canons, or that these Morville Chaplains of Earl Roger were not esteemed regular Canons or amenable to the rules which governed such collegiate bodies. Besides the lapse of these Prebends, the Church of Morville had at this period been otherwise endowed ; or, at least, grants which had been made to Salop Abbey, were considered appanages of its subject Church of Morville. Such were the grants of a great part 11 Vide Hist. Shrewsbury, vol. ii, page 2; and Arch\u0153ologia Cambrensis, New Series No. xiv, page 100."], [65, "MORVILLE. 33 of Tugford (perhaps including Fertecote, a vill not at present traced) by Warin the Sheriff, and his successor Rainald, previous to 1086. Such also was the grant x- of tithes of his demesne in Astley, by Earl Hugh de Montgomery, if indeed this were the origin of that undoubted right of the Abbey. Moreover, Warin's grant of the tithes of the whole vill of Weston, and of two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Henley, and Earl Hugh's grant of two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Neuton, and perhaps of Lye, will belong to the same category. Consistently with the above, a suit which, between 1108 and 1113, arose between William, son of Rainer de Tangelanda (Thong lands), and the Abbey, about the continuance of a lease of Fertecote, will have primarily been a question as to the Abbot's rights in a part of his Morville fief. So also the suit which, between 1113 and 1121, arose between the Abbey and Rainald, son of Tursthi Buich, as to the right of the latter to hold, in fee and inheritance, land near Bridgnorth and the Severn, of which his father had had a life-lease. The latter suit ended in the sickness and retractation of Rainald, his being shorn a Monk of Salop Abbey, and dying not long after his father. 12 The Charter here quoted stands No. 5 in the Salop Chartulary, and is printed in the New Monasticon, vol. iii, p. 520. I have quoted it, though believing it to be one of the most unfortunate pieces of evi- dence which remains on the folios of a most valuable record. That it was framed to establish an unfounded right to any one of the various gifts which it recites is not, I believe, the case, and so far the term \"forgery,\" though applicable to it on some grounds, should be explained. There can be httle question, from other evidence, that Earl Hugh granted or confirmed, or sanctioned, all that the Charter conveys. Nor is the alleged attestation of Warin the Sheriff, who was dead long before Earl Hugh's succession, a material objection, seeing that attestation of these early Charters does not imply the then presence of the witness, so much as an assertion on the part of the writer of the Charter that that witness had been a witness, or a party to the transfer, all of it or part of it, at one time or other. But the main objec tion to this Charter is that Earl Hugh is made to speak in the fh-Bt person through- out, and ends by professing to seal it with his own seal, while it is quite certain that no such Charter was written in his day, or sealed with his seal, while living. This point is settled by internal evidence. The Earl talks of his demesne of \" Astley, near Bruge,\" whereas Bruge was a nameless and barren roek in his day, and probably involved in the very demesne of Astley, which he is speaking of. He also grants other tithes as of his own demesne, where demesne he never had, though the Abbey certainly had other title to these very tithes, and Earl Hugh may have con- firmed such title, and I believe did. The foi-mula too of \"Hiis testibus,\" which introduces the witnesses' names, is of a later age than Earl Hugh's. The best and the worst to be concluded of this Charter is that it is a clumsy attempt of some Monk to improve a title which needed no such fortifying ; and if any seal of Earl Hugh was ever attached to the document (which I doubt), such affix was only not a great fraud because it was a greater folly."], [66, "34 MORVILLE. At this period, or more precisely a.d. 1118, the Monks of Salop had built a new13 Church at Morville; and Geoffry (de Clive), Bishop of Hereford, attended to its consecration. We should neither have known this fact nor its date, but for an awful accident which followed, and which drew the attention of contemporary Chroniclers14 to thc circumstances. Tlie day had been unusually fine, and those who had flocked to the ceremony of consecration were on their way home. A tremendous thunder-storm came on. Seven of the travellers, two of them females, were sheltering in one spot. The women were struck by the lightning and killed ; the men had a narrow escape with life, and five horses belonging to the party perished. After the rebuilding of the Church for a period of twenty years, we can trace nothing directly of the Church of St. Gregory, its possessions, or its interests ; indeed the whole history of the County is involved in a similar obscurity. In the year 1121-2, or else in 1126-7, King Henry I, being then at Norton (near Cundover), issued a general precept15 to Richard (de Capella), Bishop of Hereford, commanding him that he cause the Abbot of Salop to enjoy all such Churches, lands, &c, in his Diocese, as the Abbot's predecessors had enjoyed. This precept may have been connected with the following circumstances. It would seem that ever since the foundation of Salop Abbey, the Norman Abbey of Seez had laid claim, if not to the house itself as an affiliation, yet to certain of those possessions, whereto the latter exhibited an independent title. This probably arose from Shrewsbury Abbey, having been built and first occupied by Sagian Monks, imported from Earl Roger's Norman fief. The two first Abbots of Shrewsbury came also from Seez, and no one can read Earl Roger's foundation Charter, a document of indubitable authority,16 without seeing that it was framed in antagonism to some such claim 13 The architectural notice of the present Church of Morville, with which I am favoured by the Rev. J. L. Petit, and which is given below, renders it probable that nothing whatever of this structure of 1118, beyond the materials is now existent. Monasticon, vol. iii, page 519. In the History of Shrewsbury, vol. ii, pp. 11-15, an opinion generaDy favourable as to its genuineness is expressed, but some objec tions are also stated. I can only say, with regard to the latter, that, after a careful comparison of the document with Domes day, and other evidence in the Chartulary, I cannot find grounds for one of them.

As regards the possessions of Morville Church a claim had thus been made on its Manor of Billingsley ; and successfully too, for the foreign Abbey appears to have been seized thereof, when about a.d. 1147 the claims of both houses were adjudicated upon by Robert de Betun, Bishop of Here ford. The composition 17 which ensued left Billingsley in possession of the Abbey of Seez. Thus Salop Abbey will have lost a Manor of about one and a half hides in extent, and so, nearly a fifth of the eight hides to which it had been entitled by force of Earl Roger's original grant of Morville Church, and its appurtenances. The manorial possessions of the latter, or at least what remained uncontested of them, will about this time, or rather sooner, have become more immediately subject to Salop Abbey, in consequence of arrangements which must now be mentioned ; and we may here dismiss any detailed account of separate Manors or townships, leaving to such as demand it a future and distinct notice. The more comprehensive subject which now arises is a jurisdic tion, rather parochial than manorial, and which Morville Church had doubtless exercised in Saxon times, and contrived to retain or regain after the Conquest. In all Alnodestreu Hundred, Domesday tell us but of one Church then existent, viz. that of St. Gregory. Whatever qualification18 we may put upon this feature of the record, it is certain that the parish of St. Gregory extended far beyond its manorial interests, and involved a very important spiritual jurisdic tion. It was about the year 1138, that Robert de Betun, the Diocesan, sympathizing, as he said, with the necessities of Salop Abbey, granted 19 to that house an appropriation of its Church of Momerfeuld, enjoining however that it should be colonized with Monks from Shrewsbury, changeable at the Abbot's discretion.

The objec tion which is made as regards Morville is, that the Earl grants the Church of Mamerfeld, with all the land which the Clerks held. He means by the Clerks his own Chaplains, not the Saxon Canons, as the historians of Shrewsbury have pre sumed. Ou this ground they attack the Charter as contradictory to Domesday, which speaks only of five-eighths of such laud having been granted to the Abbey. This is however merely saying that Domes day is silent as to the directions of the"], [68, "36 MORVILLE. The object of the latter proviso was ostensibly, \" a full discharge of the duties of hospitality there, in proportion to the local means.\" Morville thus became a Priory, and subject most directly to Salop Abbey. Its ecclesiastical rights, with which alone the Bishop had to do, were no longer matters of local concern or exercise. They were transferred to the Chapter-House at Shrewsbury. The Bishop's Charter proceeds to specify what they were, and they must be enumerated here. 1. A pension of 6s. 8d. from the Chapel of Billingsley, and half the corn-tithes of the same vill . Thus, though the Manor belonged to Seez, the parochial jurisdiction remained with Morville Church, and was now to be transferred to Salop Abbey. In other words, a Chapel had been some time built and endowed at Billingsley, in the parish of St. Gregory. St. Gregory had probably given up half the corn-tithe as an endowment, retaining however the other half, and exacting a pension of half a merk as a token of subjection to the Mother Church. 2. A pension of 5*. from the Chapel of Oldbury ; an acknowledg ment of parochial subjection quite independent of any territorial right. 3. A pension of 6*. 8d. from Tasley Chapel, a case like the last. The Charter then mentions certain pensions accruing to Salop Abbey, from other sources (alias debit as), i. e., such as did notarise from the appropriation of the rights of St. Gregory. But it further confirms the tithes of Astley, both of the Abbot's own demesne there, as well as those granted by others (seemingly an allusion to Earl Hugh's grant), also two-thirds of the tithes of the Lords of Henley, Neuton,20 and Upton,50 all which were probably appurtenant primarily to the Church of Morville, though the Charter does not say so. So then, at this date (1138), in the parish of St. Gregory, three subject Chapels had been founded since Domesday, viz. at Billings ley, Oldbury, and Tasley. Within a year or two Robert Fitz-Aer founded 21 another at Aston Aer, endowing it himself with sixty acres of land, a house, and all tithes of his demesne. Within ten years two other such Chapels had been built, viz. at Aldenham aud 20 These places I take to be Neeuton and Upton-super-Edge (afterwards Upton Cresset), but I cannot trace the original grant of tithes in either. At Neenton however Salop Abbey possessed a subse- quent ecclesiastical interest of a kind which was not unusually a result of a primary possession of tithes. 21 Salop Chartulary, No. 346."], [69, "37 MORVILLE. Underdon, with different endowments ; and the same Bishop again confirming\u2014 to Salop Abbey, and addressing his Dean and Chapter of Hereford, tells them that he has consecrated so many Chapels as a \" protection for the poor, and having respect to the warlike troubles of the time,\" and he enjoins that all these Chapels \"be still subject to the Mother Church of Morville, so that, on great festivals, the people shall attend the latter, and the Priest of the latter shall, if he so wills, have the bodies of the dead carried thither for burial.\" The Bishop further stipulates that the endowments of these Chapels (the lands and tithes given to them) shall alway be at the disposal of the Mother Church. He also charges his own successors not to require more than he had ap pointed in the way of Episcopal dues, \" lest,\" says he, and the expression is significant, \" what I have done in defence of the poor prove an injury to the Monks.\" Again, the same Bishop consecrated on October 14th-3 (the year unmentioned) , a new Chapel at Astley Abbots, for there seems to have been one before, but probably disused ; and this Chapel was endowed, by the __fobot of Salop himself, with half a virgate of land (30 acres), a house and assart-land, worth 4s. per annum. No tithes were given up for this endowment. Here then were seven Chapels in one great parish, nearly all of them consecrated by a single Bishop, and their endowments and relations to the Mother-Church definitely settled. And this was in the stormy reign of Stephen, a time little likely, one would imagine, to have excelled in works of peace and charity. Without forgetting the great influence which is ever assuaging human evil with some correlative of good, we may classify the subordinate agents in this local change, and judge of each by his conduct. The Bishop was the prime mover of the work, and he was one who has been chronicled in other and independent records 2* as a friend of the poor and oppressed, the opponent of power whenever associated with wrong, and a great personal sufferer for such his integrity. Then there are the Abbot and Monks of the great Benedictine House, at Shrewsbury, yielding a not very ready sympathy to the movement, and carefully protecting their own interests throughout. Lastly there are the Barons and Knights of the County, endowing Sacra; also the History of Lanthony Abbey (in the Monasticon) and the Gesta Regis Slepliani. 22 Salop Chartulary, No. 333. 23 \" The day of St. Calixtus.\" 24 See lus life printed in the Anglia"], [70, "38 MORVILLE. Chapels out of their own means,25 when the spiritual superintendence of the district was directly acknowledged to be the charge of an establishment already endowed. Morville, simply as a Cell or Priory, and shorn of all its original influence, remained subject to Shrewsbury Abbey till the Reforma tion. Its ancient dependencies, as the Church of St. Gregory, rendered whatever allegiance was due, substantially and probably immediately to the Abbot, who held his privileged Court at Astley, without interference of the Prior of Morville, other than as a subordinate. The names of no Priors26 of Morville occur, where they might be most expected, in the Salop Chartulary. In Michaelmas Term, 1 220, John Prior' of Momerfeld appeared in the Courts at West minster as the Abbot's Attorney in a law-suit. Iii 1255 the jurors, empanelled to answer certain questions as to tenures and privileges in the Hundred of Stottesden, reported as follows: \u2014 that the Abbot of Salop was Lord of part of Momerefeld; that his share was one carrucate, which he held in demesne; that he owed no suit for the same (to County or Hundred Court) ; that he had thereof the King's charter, and that his feoffor was Earl Roger. \"And,\" say the jurors, \" the said vill was never hidaged,\" by which they must have meant, never assessed according to any separate hidage, which was likely enough, as it was subject to no assessment of those which were chargeable on the hidage of manors. We may however estimate the carrucate which Salop Abbey had in Morville itself, as something like half a hide, and this both with reference to the previous survey of Domesday and a subsequent statement ~7 as to acreage. 25 The Chapels of Billingsley, Oldbury, Aston Aer, and Aldenham, were founded or endowed by laics, and probably Tasley. The great injustice which resulted in such cases was that in process of time the Abbey engrossed the greater share of these en dowments, leaving but a slender pittance to the Incumbents, whereas of course a local benefit was the primary object of the Founders. Before the case came before the Justices of the Forest, viz., Feb. 3d, 1262, this Prior was dead. Placita foreste apud Salop, 46 Hen. Ill, memb. 4. John Perle occurs as Prior, June 16th, 1353 (Vide infra). 27 The carrucate itself is never once men tioned in the Shropshire Domesday. The word abbreviated thus, car, car, is always carruca, an ox-team. Elsewhere in Domes dag (as sol. 269 b.) the word, similarly abbreviated, stands oftenest for carrucata, and in one entry is so written in full. But car, as au abbreviation of carruca, is used on the very same page.

In 1280, the Abbot of Salop was receiving a pension from the Church of Morville, as distinct from the Priory, under the usual system of exaction. It was two merks (.\u20ac1. 6s. 8d.) per annum, and John Archbishop of Canterbury sanctioned it, by deed38 of August 23d in that year. In 1291, the Church of Morville, with three of its Chapels, Astley, Aston Aer, and Billingsley, was valued as realizing to the Incumbent =\u20ac17. 6*. 8c.. per annum ; but how this valuation was made up, and what were the services thus remunerated, does not appear. The pensions deriveable, at the same date, from the Chapels of Oldbury and Tasley, were estimated as part of the income of the Prior. In 1341, the parish of Morville was assessed as follows: its taxation or ecclesiastical value, including Chapels, was 26 merks (.\u20ac17. 6*. 8-..) ; but the assessors of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, in the same parish, rendered account only of \u20ac10. 3*. 4d. ; \" so much less than the Church valuation, because there had been a common murrain in this year ; and because small tithes, offerings, and other profits go to make up the higher taxation and are not comprised in this ; and because many tenants have thrown up their holdings through poverty; and because there are two carrucates, and one noke of land (within the parish), which belong to the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, of Brugg, and pay nothing towards said ninth. But in the said ninth are included the temporalities of Salop Abbey, which are taxed like other (tenures) within the parish.\" INCUMBENTS OF MORVILLE. Of the early incumbents of this Church I can say but little. I have only found two of the 13th century, and both of them have merely the title of Chaplain. Roger, the earliest of these Chaplains, was Father of that Richard, whom I shall mention hereafter as Shropshire, I do not suppose that any invariable or ascertained ratio can be established between the Domesday mea surement by the hide, and the later com putation by the carrucate.

Later in the century, Richard, Chaplain of Morville, attests a grant by Hugh, Lord of Upton (Cresset), to Morville Church, which I shall have occasion to notice hereafter. The earlier Registers of Hereford exhibit no instance of a pre sentation to this office, neither is it mentioned in the Valor of 1535. In 1545, as will presently appear, the officiating Minister here is styled merely Curate, and his stipend, chargeable on the Priory, was \u20ac5. 16.. O^d. per annum. Finally, to show the ever varying combination which, under the monastic rule, confused both territory, tithes, Church, Chapels, and Priory, we may add an account of the state of things, such as the Reformation found and left them, here. Previous to July 30th, 1529, Richard Marshall, alias Baker, twenty-eighth Abbot of Shrewsbury (if the list 29 be correct) had resigned, for on that day the election of his successor Thomas Boteler, twenty-ninth and last Abbot, received the Royal assent. The resigning Abbot had a pension of \u20ac40 per annum assigned him by his Convent. To make up that sum a deed30 under the Convent seal, passed 22d October, 1529, granting to him, inter alia, for term of life, the Cell or Grange31 of Morfield, with all its lands, meadows, pastures, and other hereditaments, both temporal and spiritual. We learn from a valuation of subsequent date (June 16th, 1545), and made by Royal Commission, both the gross and net value of the premises thus conveyed, and further, in what they consisted. This last record or \"extent\" of Morville Priory must be briefly given. It was on this wise : \u2014 29 Hist.

The earliest architectural features appear to belong to the latter part of the 12th century. The tower has very thick walls, and the Norman flat buttress or pilaster at the angles. Its upper part is of a much later date. The arches which separate the nave from the aisles are semicircular : their mouldings indicate a transitional period, when the pure Norman style was beginning to make way for the Gothic which succeeded it. We have many buildings which may be referred to this interesting epoch in architecture ; they sometimes exhibit the tendency to change in the form of the arch, as at Buildwas ; and sometimes in the mould ings, while the arch continues to be semicircular. Sometimes it is shown both by the arch and its mouldings, but then some mark or other rarely fails to occur by which the date may be detected. Here we find a convex moulding, the section of which represents the form of a pointed arch ; this I think does not occur in earlier work. J3-he piers are of a somewhat uncommon plan, namely, a square, in the sides of which are engaged shafts, or semi-shafts whose section is an ogee-pointed arch ; the form of the abacus is octagonal. The Chancel-arch is semicircular ; its western face exhibits a shaft with an enriched capital, and two double rows of billets, those of the inner row being smaller than we usually find in Norman work. On the north side of the chancel is a door or porch, with a semi circular arch under a plain gabled canopy. Above the arch is a stone, bearing the date 1683; but as there can be no doubt that the string-courses, from which the arch springs, and the sculpture in its head, are as early as the 12th century, this date probably refers 34 Originalia, 37 Hen.

We have now treated of Morville as the caput of a Saxon and Domesday Hundred, as centre of a great Manor, and Mother- Church of a still greater Parish. We have seen it lose all these dignities and become ecclesiastically a very mean Priory or Cell of Shrewsbury Abbey, manorially a small tenement of less than a hundred acres, and as a seat of provincial government, nothing. We may now dismiss the subject and revert to its manorial adjuncts, if our identification of them at the time of Domesday may, for the present, be accepted as probable. First on the list will stand Astley, sometimes called Astley Brug, but with a better note of distinction. \u2014 ASTLEY ABBOTS. This township engrossed to itself at a very early period the manorial dignity of Morville, as far as the interests of Salop Abbey were concerned. When spoken of as a Manor of five hides, as in 1255, it must be taken to involve a great proportion of the seventeen unnamed berewicks of Domesday. Little Astley, Norley, Croft, Haughton, Kingslow, Road, Stanley, Dunvall, Colemore, Severn Hall, Can treyn, Rucroft, and Bunewall, 35 are hamlets, messuages, or tene ments found at diverse period as members of this Manor, and some nine or ten of them will have been of the Domesday berewicks. Of them more in detail hereafter. If Earl Hugh granted to Salop Abbey tithes of his demesne of 35 The Haye, Deepdale, naseldene, also occur, and others of still less note."], [84, "44 MORVILLE. Astley, as alledged, that demesne will probably have lain in the direction which was afterwards occupied by the town of Bridgnorth. At the northern extremity of its Manor of Astley, the Abbey seems to have early made an acquisition of some importance in those days. Between the years 1135 and 1141 (because subsequently to the death of Henry I, and previously to the Empress' comfirmation 36 thereof), Hamon Peverel granted the \"fishery and passage\" of Sutton. This will have been a right of weir and ferry in the river Severn, 'probably at the point where the Manors of Apley and Sutton Maddock now converge on the eastern bank of that river. About the same time 37 Robert, Bishop of Hereford, appropriating Morville Church to Salop Abbey, includes a pension of eight shilbugs arising from its subject Chapel of Estley. He also con firms all the tithes as well of the Abbot's demesne of Estley, as those \" anciently given by others in the same parish.\" About the year 1160,38 Robert, Abbot of Salop, with consent of his Chapter, granted to Philip Fitz-Stephen and his heirs, the fishery of Sutton (piscariam de Sutuna) and the land, of which Richard and Hugh were tenants, near the fishery. The annual rent reserved was Is. id., payable at Michaelmas. The witnesses of this feoffment have reference to the locality. They were Richard the Priest of Hestlee (Astley), Hugh Piscator (Fisher) of Brugg, Alexander the Forester, Ralph son of Ordric, Alduin de Harpesfort (Harps wood), and Bermer de Norlee (Nordley). In 1180, among those amerced39 by the Justices of the Forest, then visiting this County, were several of the Abbot of Salop's tenants at Astley and Norley. The subject of these amercements was certain purprestures and tillages within the limits of the King's forest of Shirlet. Among the names are Albinus, Robert de Bonewell, Reginald de Halcton, William de la Rode, Andrew, Richard the Provost, and Robert Wendac, each of whom was more or less connected with the local history of the Manor. The Provost named was probably the Bailiff of the Abbot of Salop.

Simon de Sabrina, was of the jury43 which attended at Salop to make report to a Royal Commission on several matters relating to Stottesden Hundred. There is a record44 written apparently about the end of the thirteenth century, and which takes note of certain villages, woods, &c, pertaining to the custody of the King's forest (hay\u00e6), of Schirlet, and which had been disafforested by perambulation made thereof.\" Among them are Colemore, Stanleye, Rucroft, Medewe grene, Contreyne, the messuage of Simon de Sabrina (now Severn Hall), Northleye, Astley Abbots, La Dunfowe (now Dunvall), La Rode (now Road or Rhodes), Kinsedeleye (now Kingslow), Tasley, Crofte, Haleygton (now Haughton), Momerfeld, Lee (Lye), Un derdone, Walton (now Bridge warton), and Harpesford. About the year 1267,45 Philip, Lord of Baggesovere (Badger), for the sum of four merks, sold to William Abbot, and the Convent, of Salop, all the land which he had in their Manor of Astlee, with all his rights in rents, homages, reliefs, escheats, &c, which land he held (of them) at 5s. rent. The object of this sale or surrender, though itself of some interest, is not to our present purpose.

In 1284 there was an inquisition46 of the kind afterwards classified as \"ad quod damnum,\" relating to the Abbot of Salop, as Lord of Astley juxta Brug, making assarts in Shirlet forest. In 1291 we have a valuation of the Abbot's temporal interests here : \u2014 He had four carrucates of land (in demesne), \u00a3 s. d. estimated as annually worth (at 13s. 4tf. per carrucate) . . . . . . . 2 13 4 He had a parcel of meadow-land worth . . 0 3 4 A mill 0 13 4 In rents 11 2 Oi In pleas and perquisites (of the Manor Court) 0 8 6 His revenue here will therefore have been . .\u20ac15 0 6f We have other valuations of this Manor, which, though made more than two centuries afterwards, may be given here if only for com parison.

A person, whose name is written Robert Wendac, has been already mentioned as concerned here in 1180. In June, 1194, Cecilia and Sibilla, apparently daughters and co-heirs of this Robert, who seems also to have been son of another Robert (whose name is written \"Wandard\"), were sued4^ for the inheritance of the latter by William Savage, alleging himself to be son of another William Savage, eldest son of said Robert Wandard. The Record is not very clear on all points, but the progress of the cause was nearly as follows : \u2014 \u2022 On June 6th, 1194, the defendants Cecily and Sibil, with their husbands William Turald and Geoffry de Molendino, had essoign in the Court at Westminster till July 1st following. The ground of essoign appears to have been the sickness of Cecily, for on the day appointed (July 1st),50 four visors who ought to have been in Court to testify their view of the infirmity of Cecilia de Cantinunt (a corruption of Cantreyn or Cantern) came not. They were summoned again for one month of Michaelmas, and at the same time 31 Geoffry and Sibil appointed William fitz Turald (Cecilia's husband) their attorney, to win or lose (ad lucrandum vel per dendum). On October 27th, the cause 5- came on for hearing. The lands in dispute were two carrucates in Estlee, with three messuages and ten acres in Bruge (Bridgnorth) . Each party seems to have pleaded a right founded on the primogeniture of either of the two sons of Robert Wandard, the defendants adding, in confirmation, their possession of other lands in Bruge, similarly derived. The defen dants required \" view \" thereof, which the Court granted, and adjourned the case till the quinzaine of St. Martin, and such view was to be taken in the interim. On November 24th, 1194, three of the four knights appointed to take this view certified i3 to the Court their discharge of such duty ; but the case did not end here, Potuli Curiee Pegis, the first volume of which purports to be a transcript of all existent judicial records of that reign.

The minutes of that term and many subsequent terms are lost, and we can only conclude from the record of a suit many years afterwards, that the defendants did not lose all if any of the premises. In Michaelmas Term, 1221, 5S Geoffry (de Molendino) and Sibil fitz Robert (so written in this case) being dead, and Richard de Kinsedel (Kinslow), second husband of Sibil, surviving, William, the son of Geoffry and Sibil, being then a minor, sued said Richard for a mill and eighteen acres here, the right of his mother. Richard pleaded his marriage of Sibil, and that, having had chil dren by her, he was entitled by custom of England to her inherit ance for his life. The plaintiff William rejoined with two pleas : one that Richard's children were not by his mother Sibil, but by a later wife; the other that Richard was a villain.56 Tlie truth of one or both of these last assertions is apparent from the sequel, for Richard, though in possession, resigned his claim for half a merk (6s. 8c..) THE CHURCH OF ASTLEY ABBOTS. There will have been a Church or Chapel here within half a century after Domesday, for Robert de Betun5? appropriating Morville Church to Salop Abbey about a.d. 1138, included a pension of 8s. arising from its subject \" Chapel of Estleya.\" The same58 Bishop, when he consecrated a new Chapel and Cemetery here shortly after, speaks of the previous dependence of the Chapel on Morville Church, and directs that it continue. The Abbot of Salop's endowment of the new foundation has already been stated, and it would seem that for a time such endowment will have been unrevoked. However about 1217,59 Hugh (de Mapenore), Bishop of Hereford, granted to Morville Priory an appropriation hereof, saving the life interest of Gerard de Egymendune (Ed\u00b0- mond), the then Incumbent.

After Gerard de Egymendune's Incumbency, the officiating minister here like him at Morville seems to have been entitled \" Chaplain.\" Henry Chaplain of \" Esteleg \" was father of that Joseph who will appear elsewhere as grantee of Henry de Bunewall and Robert de Teneray in the Manor. About September, 1258, Richard Chaplain of \" Estleg \" attests a Salop charter, relating to land in Astley. The earliest notice on the Diocesan Register is of date June 16th, 1353, when John Perle, Prior of Morville and Proctor of Salop Abbey, admitted before the Bishop, at his Yisitation of Morville, that the Abbot was bound to find and maintain a Chaplain in the Chapel of Astley, dependent on Morville Church. The admission argues the previous neglect of such duty, or at least au attempt to evade it ; \u2014 another hint as to the way in which the Monastic Houses of that period attended to the spiritual interests of their dependents. ASTLEY PARVA, Called also \" alia Estleia \" and \" parva Estleham,\" was one of those adjuncts of Morville which Earl Roger's grant, as interpreted by the confirmation of King William, conveyed to Salop Abbey. About a.d. 1220, the Abbot seems to have added to his demesne by purchase from and exchange with two of his tenants here. He paid60 Geoffry, the Irishman (le Hyreis), of Brug three and a half merks for a culture under Little Estleham (Astley Home), and gave 6l Henry le Map half a virgate in Nordley, and a meadow between Henley and Kingslow-bridge, to hold for a rent of 2s. M. in exchange for his tenancy in Little Estleg. NORDLEY or NORLEY. This vill was similarly involved in Earl Roger's grant. A family, taking its name from the place, seems to have held the principal <\" Salop Chartulary, No. 147. 6I Ibidem, No. 153."], [90, "50 MORVILLE. tenancy here under Salop Abbey. Bermer de Norlec has already <% occurred about 1160, and Andrew de Norley, or a succession es of Andrews, occurs from 1180 for more than seventy years. In November, 1221,64 the Abbot of Salop was sued by William Fitz-Walter for disseising him of his free tenement here ; but in vain, for the cousins of William proved him to be a villain.65 By inquest 66 held at Astley, on \" quasi modo geniti \" Sunday, 1 Edw. I (April 16th, 1273), after death of Henry le Forcer, Lord of Linley, and a tenant in capite at Brockton, it was found that he held in socage here of Salop Abbey, paying an annual rent of 8s., and doing suit thrice a year at the Abbot's Court of Astley. Con sistently with this there are deeds 67 in the Salop Chartulary, which evidently passed in Astley Abbots Manor-Court, and which are attested by members of this family. CROFT. This place, also involved in Earl Roger's grant, gave name to certain tenants thereof under Salop Abbey. September 26th,68 1199, Nicholas de la Rode having impleaded William de Crofte, the tenant, for a virgate of land here, relin quished his claim hy final concord at Salop Assizes, receiving 10s. In October, 1203,69 this virgate became again a subject of litigation. William de Crofte having enfeoffed Richard de Crofte therein, the latter, as tenant, was sued at Salop Assizes by writ of mort d' ancestre for the same. The plaintiff, Reginald de Crofte, alleged that his father (another Reginald) had died seized thereof, and that he was his heir. Richard de Crofte, the defendant, called to warrantry William de Crofte, who duly appeared and established his title by producing in Court the fine, or \" chirograph,\" of 1199. Reginald was then asked by the Court why, on the occasion of that fine being levied, he did not put in his claim. His answer was, that he was then in Cheshire ; and so he was nonsuited. 62 Vide page 44. m Inquisitiones post mortem, 1 Ed. I. 63 Forest Poll at Westminster. Salop, No. 1.

But about the middle of the 13th century the Abbot had a clerical tenant here, of great wealth and still greater notoriety. The earliest occurrence of Master Walter le Palmer, of Brug, is his being enfeoffed73 by Sibil de Halchtun (Haughton), widow, in an acre of land in Haughton, which was already bounded on two sides by lands of his tenure, and on a third by a meadow which separated Kinslow and Croft. In the year 1255 73 the possessions of this Master Walter le Palmer, at Church Stretton and Bridgnorth, had been seized into the King's hands under the following circumstances. He stood indicted for entertaining one Roger de Kinver, an outlaw, and also for the murders of Matilda, aunt of John de Gatacre, and of William Kilmayn. \u2022 His Father, Hamon le Palmer, seems to have been implicated. Walter however contrived to free both himself and his Father from all liability to the civil power, by large pecu niary offerings (oblata), in which the Abbot of Buildwas was his surety. His guilt however is more clearly proved, than by the sus picion which his large fine alone would warrant. He was put upon his trial74 in the Crown Court, at Salop Assizes, in January, 1256. The Official of the Bishop of Coventry demanded that he be sur rendered to the spiritual power, being a Clerk. The King's Justices acquiesced, but directed the Jury first to give their verdict, on the Crown prosecution, \" to the end,\" says the record, \" that it may be known wiiat kind of character is thus siu'rendered.\" The jury pronounced him guilty of the murder of Matilda, but not guilty of the other offences. It being also found that he had lay possessions, all that the Justiciars could do was to order the Sheriff to seize the same on behalf of the Crown. His fate in the Ecclesiastical Court does not appear, but there is a full record of his ultimate com position with the civil power. What with replevying his lands and chattels, compounding for the non-appearance of Hamon, his Father, at the Assizes, and his fine for his said Father's lands and chattels ; he appears on the Pipe Roll,75 of Michaelmas, 1256, as having been 73 Salop Assize Roll, 40 Henry III, (Placita Coron\u00e6 Rot. 4 dorso, & 10 recto.) 74 Salop Assize Roll, 40 Henry III, memb. 10 recto. 70 Salop Chartulary, No. 137\u2014 if I rightly date the deed, c. 1215. 71 Ibidem, No. 274 b. 72 Charter in the possession of the Rev.

Of this debt he had already paid \u20ac43. 6s. 8c.. into the King's Treasury, \u20ac5. to Remigius de Arundel, the Sheriff's Clerk, and owed only \u20ac3. 6s. 8d. His payment of this balance is the last item on the Sheriff's accounts of the year. We have one more local reminiscence of this individual. In November, 1260, as tenant of a messuage and one carrucate of land in Crofte, he compounded by payment of 26 merks (\u20ac17. 6s. 8d.), a claim which one Alan Strannelone had made on the same. This fine \"6 was levied at Westminster, and appears to be the termination of a real suit. HAUGHTON\u2014 Another member of Astley, gave name to the family of that Reginald de Halctun, who has already been mentioned as subject in 1180 to the amercement of the Justices of the Forest. But the principal tenant here, in the beginning of the next century, was Robert de Teneray, in right of his wife Sibil, daughter and heir of \"Floria de Halectun.\" This Robert de Teneray having a temporary lease of some tenement in Kinslow, and exercising a presumed right of pasture in that vill, was disseized of the latter by Geoffry de \"Kynesle,\" the principal owner there. His action'7 of novel disseisin against said Geoffry was tried at Salop Assizes, in November, 1221, and failed, inasmuch as his interest in Kinslow was a terminal one, and did not amount to a, free tenure. This Robert de Teneray and Sibil his wife occur about the same time, as granting a life lease78 to one Joseph fitz Henry, of a house and land in \"Halechtone.\" Sibil also, now a widow, enfeoffed \"9 the Priory of Morville hi the same and other lands here, by two separate deeds, the last of which reserves a rent of 15 pence to herself. This reserved rent she, by a further deed,80 quitted to the Priory, whose obligation in lieu thereof was to pay 2 pence annually towards lighting the Church. Again, the same Sibil, now remarried to Richard, son of Roger 76 Pedes finium, 45 Hen. III. I shall have again to speak of this Master Walter le Palmer in another connexkm. He was member of a family, which, at this period, was by far the wealthiest and most im portant within the Borough of Bridg north, and whose purchases and interest. are the prominent feature of a large col lection of documents at Apley Park. 77 Salop Assize Poll, 6 Hen.

This was the grant before alluded to, as confirmed by oath of the grantors in the Abbot's Court at Astley, and in presence of his Seneschal. It is further possible, that this Sibil may be she who enfeoffed 82 Master Walter le Palmer here, as mentioned under Croft ; but, if so, that grant will have been in her second widowhood. KINGSLOW ou KINSLOW. A family of some wealth and importance, in the 13th century, held here under the Abbey. Geoffry de Kynsedel stands high in a list 83 of the Abbot's Court at Astley, which dates about 1215. November, 1221. \u2014 He was gainer of the suit84 of novel disseisin, by which Robert de Teneray (before mentioned), and Albinus de la Rode, sought to establish a right of pasturage here. About the same period, either singly, or with Hugh his son, he is witness to a number of charters affecting the Manor of Astley. About the year 1226,85 Hugh de Kynsedeleg attests a charter to Salop Abbey singly. In Michaelmas Term, 1230, he was under prosecution,86 as a partizan of Walter de Clifford, in an assault on the men of the Priory of Wenlock. He is a very frequent witness of deeds in the Salop Chartulary at this period, and one 87 of which is dated 1252. In 1255, he was one of the jury who made inquest 88 as to tl e state of the Hundred of Stottesden, before the King's Commissioners. In January, 1256, at Salop Assizes, he fined89 half a merk for some replevin, Bertram de Burgo being his surety. On January 20, 1257, a writ90 of the Crown directed inquest to 81 Ibidem, Nos. 102, 104. One of the lights mentioned is the \" rota,\" or great chandelier, and hence Mr. Blakeway argues the existence of some ecclesiastical splen dour in the Priory Church of the period.

Richard de Donfowe attests a deed lu at Astley which speaks of Richard de Deonewall (Dunvall) being a tenant there, and it is by no means impossible that the same person should have been thus variously written in one deed. In a final concord112 of November, 1258, the place is written Dunfowe, and, in the deafforestation 1U described under Astley, La Dunfowe is named between Astley and Rode. If Dunvall were a different place the only indication thereof has been already submitted. There were in the thirteenth century several tenants of the Abbey at Shrewsbury, who were of this family and whose name is written with similar variations. COLEMORE. Of this adjunct of Astley Abbots, little more can be said than that at one time it was held by a family of some importance, and which will have to be noticed elsewhere. About a.d. 1215, l14 Thomas de Bardeley appears as attendant on the Abbot's Manorial Court at Astley, and some years later Thomas dc Berdelei sold 115 to the Abbey for eight merks, \" all the fee which he had in the Manor of Estleg, viz. in Colemer.\" May 25th, 1298.

The question was, whether Simon dc Severne the father had been enfeoffed twenty years before by Adam, Abbot of Salop, without consent of his Convent, or, as the defendant pleaded, by Nicholas, son of Richard de Astley ? Thc result, which was to be settled by jury, does not appear. On November 29th, 1274, Simon de Sabrina 121 was one of the jurors who had to report on the state of the Hundred of Stottesden. Among their present ments was one alleging the venality of William Le Enfant, the King's bailiff of the Hundred, who had accepted from Simon him self1-2 a bribe of 4s. Simon, it seems, had been put on the list of those liable to serve as regarders of the King's forest, but was released for the bribe in question. Simon de Sabrina occurs a frequent witness in manorial deeds of this period and that immediately following, when such documents began to be dated. I find him thus attesting in the years 123 1288, 1293, 1297, 1298, and 1302. ,, i .-.\u25a0.< , __*C7_, On February 15th, 1303, he would appear124 to have deceased, for on that day Symon, son of Symon de Sevarne, sells to Nicholas Rondulf of Brug, and Alice his wife, and their heirs, all his lands and tenements of Sevarne in the Manor of Astley Abbots, with all his woods, &c., and the land which Richard de Donfowe and Agnes, his wife (probably widow of the last Simon), hold, of the dower of Agnes, \u2014 to have and to hold of the chief Lords of the fee (the Abbot and Convent of Salop) to Nicholas and Alice, and the heirs of Nicholas.

CANTREYN or CANTERN. The judicial proceedings detailed under Astley Abbots probably relate to the family which, as tenants of Salop Abbey, had the chief interest in this locality. Consistently with that account persons bearing the name of Cantreyn, and who are frequently recurring in the manorial charters of Astley, appear also in contem porary deeds which concern property within the walls of Bridgnorth. The name of Wendac also will have passed through some genera tions within the Borough. In default of evidence sufficient to establish a connected pedigree, a few notices of persons bearing either name, and doubtless deriving from a common ancestor, shall be given. William de Cantereya appears in the Abbot's Court 12T at Astley, about a.d. 1215. William and John occur in a deed128 a little later; and then Richard and William, either singly or in conjunc tion, in a number of deeds, which appear to belong to the earlier half of the thirteenth century. William de Cantreyn further occurs in 1258 and 1265, as a witness in the Manor and in many undated deeds of the Borough which belong to that period. At Salop Assizes, 1272, he was defendant in a suit l29 about some annual rent, wherein the prosecutor, Henry le Carpenter, failed to appear. November, 1274, he was a Juror on the Borough inquest, which reported on the conduct of the local Officers of the Crown, and he, or one of his name, occurs in deeds of the years 1288, 1293, 1302, 1305, 1311, and 1326, and which variously relate to the Manor of Astley or the Borough of Bridgnorth. Again William Fitz-Geoffry, who has already'occurred as a minor in 1221, occurs later in the century as William Fitz-Geoffrey de Cantreyne, and as a different person from William de Cantreyne who attests the same deed.130 The two I take to be the repre sentatives of the two co-heiresses before mentioned, daughters of Robert Wendac.

With regard to the perpetuation of the name of Wendac,\u2014 William, Roger, and Nicholas 132 occur successively within and without the Borough, and the last before a.d. 1251, when Reginald le Gaugy, his fellow- witness, had been murdered ; of which more elsewhere. Also William, son of William Wendac, occurs 132 about the middle of the century. These, or some of them, I suppose to have repre sented William Savage, the litigant of 1194. RUCROFT. The land called Rewin, or Runin, was the subject of a decision,133 about a. d. 1215, by the oft-mentioned Abbot's Court at Astley. The land was thereby assigned to the Abbot, as of his demesne, whilst Henry Fitz Edric,134 the claimant, was to enjoy it for life, with remainder to his wife, for her life. For this he paid a fine of 16s. 4c.. for entry, and was to pay a rent of 4s. 4c.. during the term of tenancy. Whether this place were identical with that afterwards called Rucroft, or not, little remains to be said of either. William, son of Daniel,135 of Brug, was chief owner in the latter (spelt Ruiecroft) , about 1275. He grants a croft therein, but with a special warrantry, which shows both an insecurity of title, and that he had other land \"within the fee of Brug\" (the Borough liberties), by which he could amend any defect thereof. The witnesses are persons having interest either in Astley Manor or the Borough, or both, e. g., William de Kantrey, Nicholas Palmer (nephew of Hamon before mentioned), Symon de Sabrina, Nicholas del Hay, Nicholas de Stanley, &c. All I can say further of this tenement is, that Rucroft and Medow green 136 follow Stanley, and precede Cantreyne in the enumeration of vills, &c., which pertained to the custody of Shirlet forest, and which were exempted by the perambulation before alluded to. 131 Charter at Apley Park. 132 Charters at Apley Park. 133 Salop Chartulary, No. 137.

The early history of this vill involves the quotation of a series of charters, highly illustrative of each other, and throwing some light both on the conveyancing practice of the period, as well as on the system of nomenclature which described the same person by sundry names in different, and even in the same, documents. Robert de Hastings, alias Hedding or Hedinges, was some time Rector of Oldbury. As Robert de Halecton, Allechtone, or Aluhton (a name probably derived from some Haughton in Shropshire, where he may have resided), he occurs almost as frequently as under his first designation. Like other Ecclesiastics of wealth and position, he seems to have been involved in secular affairs, and like other Priests, bound to cehbacy, to have observed his vow at the expense of his morality. The first local notice which we have of him is in a deed137 whereby John Smith (Faber) sells to Robert de Eddinges all the land which he held by inheritance in the Manor of Estleg, for 16 shillings. The witnesses of this deed are Hugh de Lacy, Abbot of Salop, and Roger de Begesour (Badger), whose attestations, com bined with evidence now to be offered, will mark the document as having passed probably in the last five years of the 12th century. Becoming thus a tenant of Salop Abbey, this Robert appears interested in the concerns of that house as follows : \u2014 About a.d. 1197, as Robert de Hastinges, he attests a certificate138 of Bishop William de Vere, as to the admission of a Chaplain, at pre sentation of the same Abbot Hugh, to the Chapel of Eston (Aston Aer). At the same time, or, more precisely, between the years 1193 and 1204, as Robert de Hedinges, he attests a composition l39 between the same Abbot and John de Kilpec touching the Advowson of Norbury (Staffordshire). Again, between the years 1197 and 1213, as Robert de Heding, he attests a grant uo of Robert, Bishop of Bangor, to Salop Abbey. Further, when Thomas de Costentin confirmed, about the same period, his ancestors' endowments of Oldbury Chapel, he (Thomas) adds the grant U1 of a croft, whereon Robert de Hedeng, Rector of 137 Salop Chartulary, No. 150 c. 139 Salop Chartulary, No. 81. 140 Ibidem, No. 185. 138 Salop Chartulary, No. 312 ; aud the original document in the possession of Mr. Georgo Morris, of Shrewsbury. 141 Ibidem, No. 299 _ ."], [101, "61 MORVILLE. the said Chapel, had built a house ; and the first witness of this confirmation is the Rector himself, under the designation of Robert, Clerk of Halecton (i. e. Robert de Halecton, Clerk).1*2 But to return to his local interests in Astley Manor : Having purchased the inheritance of John Faber therein, as above, he enfeoffed l43 one Hugh Knight (Miles) in the same, for an entrance fine of 8s., and an annual rent of 3s. 6d. The witnesses of this deed of \"Robert de Hasting\" were Geoffry de Kinsedeleg (Kinslow), Nicholas de la Rode, &c. Again, as Robert de Allechton, he is described as having con ferred,144 on his son Richard, land which he held in the Manor of Estleg, of John Faber, at a penny rent ,- the meaning of which is probably, that John Faber's original sale involved a covenant for the payment of a penny rent, and also that Robert's conveyance to his son Richard was not of the fee-simple, but of the rent and other rights accruing from the previous grant to Hugh Knight. Such rent and seignoral rights, the said Richard, describing him self as son of Robert de Allechton, sold ll5 to Salop Abbey, for 24 shillings, reserving the penny rent due to John Faber and his heirs ; and this grant, purporting to be simply a transfer of the land, rather than the grantor's claims thereon, was attested by Geoffry de Kinslow, Hugh his son, and Richard and William de Cantreyn. And Robert de Alechtone, the Father, confirmed 146 this sale by Richard his son, in a further deed, tested by Geoffry de Kinslow, Richard and William de Cantreyn, and Simon Bungi. The sum of 24 shillings thus expended by Salop Abbey was part of a bequest left by Henry de Norton, a Monk, for the special service of the Altar of St. Mary in the conventual Church of Shrewsbury. We have seen that the annual product will have been a rent of 3s. 6d. payable by Hugh le Knight, the tenant. Whatever the revenue, it became, between the years 1 223 and 1228, the subject of a peculiar bargain,147 the parties to which were, ostensibly, Henry, the then Abbot of Salop, and the previously endowed Altar : in other words, the Abbot, by formal deed, assigned a rent of 3 shillings elsewhere, to furnish altar-lights, and took in exchange (and I suppose for more general purposes) \" the land purchased from Richard, son of Robert de Aluhton, parson of 145 Salop Chartulary, No. 142. 140 Salop Chartulary, No. 154. 147 Ibidem, No. 209. 142 For this usual transposition, see p. 29, note 6. 143 Salop Chartulary, No. 151 b. 144 Ibidem, No. 142."], [102, "62 MORVILLE. Aldebury, in our manor of Estleg, with the money bequeathed by Henry de Norton to same Altar.\" The Abbot's object in this ostensible exchange was evidently to increase his demesne in the Manor of Astley. This appears from a further deed,148 whereby Hugh le Knight (the tenant) granted to the Abbey all his fee in Bunewell, which he bought from Robert de Hastings, to hold for ever. The witnesses of this deed are as of the last, except that Simon Bungi is exchanged for, or called, Simon Dunfothe. The whole of these transactions will have passed between the years 1195 and 12.28; and we thus obtain the names of several persons contemporarily interested in the Manor of Astley, and further, a well-authenticated instance of the method by which a seignoral Lord might contrive to reassume a tenement, though alienated by a double subinfeudation. But there was also a family resident here which took name from the place. At the forest -pleas1*9 of 1180, Robert de Bonewell was fined 12c?. for a purpresture 15\u00b0 in Norley. In 1209 Richard de Bernewell is named as paying for imbladement}51 within regard m of Shirlet forest. Again, early in the same century, Henry de Bunewell granted153 to Joseph, son of Henry Chaplain of Astley (already mentioned under Haughton), half a vivary in said Henry de Bunewell's garden, and 2\\d. rent receiveable from Richard de Wichard and Andrew de Northleg. These premises the grantee trans ferred154 to Salop Abbey, calling the former Yendor \" Henry Fitz- Richard de Baruewell ; \" a transfer which was followed by a further grant 155 to the same house by Henry Fitz-Richard himself, viz. of land on each side the said vivary,156 \"with the fountain which was below his house, reserving to himself bberty to drink thereat.\" In February, 1262, .Simon de Bonewell157 was convicted of 143 Salop Chartulary, No. 146. 153 Salop Chartulary, No. 149 a. 149 Placita forest\u0153, Salop.

THE HAYE. This member of Astley gave name to a resident family, of whom Alan de Haya occurs in 1226 ; Nicholas de la Hay frequently in the middle of the century; Robert de la Hay, in 1297; and Simon del Hay, in 1298. Nicholas appears to have held under the descendants of one Gilbert Sadoc, a man largely interested in the concerns of Salop Abbey early in the century, and of whom I shall have to speak elsewhere. The interest of his representatives in the Haye seems to have been bought up by the Abbey about a.d. 1270, when Nicholas de Hay will have become the immediate tenant of the chief Lords, the Abbot and Convent of Salop. DEEPDALE. A few deeds in the Salop Chartulary show the reassumption by the Abbey of a small tenement thus named, the first tenant of which was one Roger Dod, whose son Richard l6\u00b0 occurs as exchanging his inheritance in Astley Manor for the inheritance of Thomas Dod. Again Thomas Dod exchanges lfil eighteen and a half acres in Astley 160 Salop Chartulary, No. 150 b. 161 Ibidem, No. 152. 158 Salop Chartulary, No. 271 -. 169 Charters at Apley Park. 9"], [104, "64 MORVILLE.

Deepdale) and Roger Dod, the former owner, are mentioned. Tlie last grantee sold164 the premises, or rather his interest therein, to Salop Abbey, before the year 1258. About the same period one Nicholas de Deepdale165 appears attesting manorial deeds. There were other and probably still smaller tenements appertain ing to this Manor of Astley, such as Haseldene, Kakeweche, Haverbache, alias Harebache, and Medowgrene, but of which I have neither ascertained the locality nor know of any point of interest connected with them. BILLINGSLEY. The signification of the last syllable of this name depends on its origin, whether British or Saxon. The British lie is identical with the French lieu and Latin locus, a place ; the Saxon ley signifies unfilled ground. The termination is found associated with words of either language, as Ar-ley which is British, and Billings-ley which is Saxon. The Dukes of Saxony, from the tenth to the twelfth century, were descended from Billing, a noble of Lunenburg. Here in 1055,156 or at least at a place written Biligesleage, Byliges leage or Bylgeslege, Harold, as general of King Edward, came to conference and peace with Griffin, Prince of Wales, and Algar, the rebel Earl of Mercia.

With respect to the justice of these claims of Seez, the Salop Chartulary of course supplies partial information, but that they were not quite unfounded may be inferred from the fact that Earl Hugh de Montgomery, as well as his brothers Earls Robert and Roger, did at some time make English grants to the Norman Abbey, and that such grants were confirmed l67 by Pope Innocent II, on May 3d, 1139. It is further noticeable how the Bishop of Hereford's adjudication168 on the subject followed the Papal Bull within eight or nine years. The immediate tenants of this manor under the Norman Abbey were a family named de Beysin or le Beysin,160- of knightly degree, and possessed of considerable property elsewhere in the County. We need here therefore only mention such points as connect them with the place. In 1255, the jurors iro of Stottesden Hundred made the following return as regarded Byllingelegh ; that Robert de Beyssin was Lord ; that he was a minor in ward to Sir William Freville, by grant of Sibyl Giffard, to whom, after death of her husband, Adam, the King had given the wardship ; that the Manor contained one and a half hides, owed suit to the Hundred Court twice in the year, but not to the County Court, nor was it liable to stretward or motfee. \"And the said Robert de Beyssin holds it in capite of the Abbot of Sesse for six merks (\u00a34.) annually.\" This wardship had fallen to the Crown eleven years before, viz. on the death1'1 of Adam de Beyssin, December 13th, 1243. The right of the Crown thereto arose from a tenure in capite by the deceased at Wrickton and Walkerslow. 10th July, 1260. Robert de Beysin had a suit of novel disseisin 167 Harl. MSS.

In 12 Edw. I (1284), Matilda de Ebroicis 172 (Devereux) had an assize of novel disseisin against Walter de Beysyn which concerned a tenement here. In 3 Edw.

THE CHURCH Was originally a Chapel, subject to Morville, as being, though at least six miles distant, within the boundaries of that extensive parish. The lay founder of this Chapel was Herbert de Castello, Lord of Castle Holgate, who endowed 175 it in the beginning of Stephen's reign with twelve acres of land and a mansion. What interest the Lords of Castle Holgate could have here, I cannot determine. None descended to their successors either in this or any adjoining Manor. Possibly Herbert might have been tenant here under Salop Abbey before the Manor was lost by that house; possibly being of the dominant political party, as there is other reason to believe he was, he may have had a temporary jurisdiction in a case of disputed territory. When, about a. d. 1138, Robert, Bishop of Hereford, appro priated Morville Church to Salop Abbey, he mentions 176 a pension of half a merk, and half the corn-tithe of this vill, as due to the mother-Church from this Chapel.

His arbitration,178 which subsequently awarded the Manor to Seez, did not affect the Church or its endowments. But a document,170 which must date within the earlier half of the 13th century, exhibits this Church or Chapel as portionary. Within that period, there was a dispute between Adam de Beysm and Salop Abbey, relative to the right of presentation to this Chapel. The result was, that Adam was to present to the portion of Robert de Beysin whenever vacant, saving to the mother-church of Mo merfield half a merk annual pension, and half the tithe of wheat and other ecclesiastical dues, and twenty pence of the pence of St. Peter.

COLD WESTON, alias WESTON. This place probably derived its name as lying west of the Great Clee Hill, as did Aston Boterell, formerly Eston, from lying to the east thereof. The omission 183, or use of the first part of the name seems to have been arbitrary. Its meaning and reference to the locality are obvious. The evidence regarding this Manor and Parish is so extremely inconclusive, that I venture only to give such notices as I am con vinced belong to it, without distinguishing them from those which may possibly refer to another locality.

At the same time a certain Knight held a Morville hide under the Monks of Salop, paying them a rent of 4s. King William's charter 186 mentions Westona, after Tugford and Fertecote, as one of the possessions of Morville Church involved in Earl Roger's grant to Salop Abbey. There was some time a charter,187 by Osbert de Tugford, to Salop Abbey, relative to five nokes of land in Coldeweston. January, 1256.

The inquest w on the death of Philip de Bagesover (Badger) returns, inter alia, that he held half a carrucate in Coldeweston under Laurence de Ludlow, at a penny rent, and it was worth 10s. per annum : also that he held in the same a place of land of the honour of Castle Holgate at a rent of Is. 6c.., which was its full value. is4 Warin the Sheriff gave before 1086 tithes of the whole vill of Weston to Salop Abbey (Salop Chartulary, No. 3), and these tithes are confirmed by subsequent deeds of two Bishops of Hereford.

There was some time a quit-claim 103 by Roger Tyrel to Salop Abbey, relative to the Church of Coldewestone. In 1291, the Church of Coldewestone,104 in the Deanery of Ludlow, was unassessed, as being of less than .\u20ac4. annual value ; but the Abbot of Salop received therefrom a pension of 3s. per annum, which was decimable (assessable to the tax) . In 1340, the Church of Coldeweston stood taxed at \u00a3-1. 3s., but the assessors of the ninth 195 (of corn, wool, and lamb) render account of only 4s. ; so little in proportion to the taxation, \" because the said Chapel is in a waste place. There was once abun dance of cattle there, but they had long been decreasing by reason of the murrain which prevailed in the district. Moreover there are only two tenants there, living by great labour and in want, and others have absconded to avoid the tax, as many throughout the country have done ; and the said Chapel has been presented, within this very year, to four Parsons, but none of them would stay.\" The first Incumbent mentioned in the Hereford Registers 196 is Walter de Ireon, Acolyte, admitted January 24th, 1310, at pre sentation of the Abbey and Convent of Salop.

Having now completed a notice of all that was involved in those eight hides of Morville, in which Salop Abbey is presumed to have been interested, either in possession or remainder, at the time of Domesday, we proceed to the two hides which are concluded to have been, at the same period, of the Norman Earl's demesne. These are supposed to have been involved in part of Astley, in 192 Ibidem, 6 Ric. II. Calendar, vol. iii, p. 49.

What was thus held in Astley has been already treated of. What was held in Morville enabled the Earl himself, when a.d. 1086 he founded the Collegiate Church of Quatford, to grant two-thirds of the tithes of Membrefelde to that establishment. What remained in Lye perhaps enabled Earl Hugh to grant107 two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Lia to Salop Abbey, and it is possible that some such grant conveyed a similar proportion of the tithes of Underdon and Walton, perhaps also of Harpsford. No further diminution of their demesne of Morville, than by these grants of tithes, was made by the Norman Earls. On their forfeiture, a.d. 1102, whatever they had held in demesne became thenceforth demesne of the Crown. w3 Such parts of this land as stood in Morville, Underdon, Walton, Lye, and perhaps Harpsford, were at some early and unrecorded period granted, by the Crown, to the Collegiate Church of St. Mary Magdalene,1\" in the Castle of Bridgnorth, and continued to form the three prebends of Morville, Walton, and Underdon in that establishment. Of these we will now speak, first collectively and then separately. In 1255, the tenure200 of these Canons of St. Mary Magdalene in Morville Manor was estimated at 3| virgates, and they were free of all suits of Court.

(probably Geoffry) Dean, and the Chapter of Hereford inform Roger Canon of Brug, that they have received a mandate of the Apostolick See, in form following, &c. The Papal Instrument alluded to and quoted is probably of Pope Alexander III (1159 1181), who has heard that the Abbot of Salop has been despoiled of the tithes of Walton without sentence (judicio) or reasonable cause, and that Roger Canon of Brug unjustly detains the same. The Dean and Chapter are appointed Commissioners to investigate the case, and they order the said Canon to appear in the Chapter- House at Hereford, on -idus Febr. (the year unmentioned) . About a.d. 1173, William de Petraponte \"l8 (Pierrepoint) was presented by King Henry II to one of the Prebends of the Church of Bruges. His subsequent dispute (circa 1180) with the Lord of Tasley as to a question of boundary, will be detailed here after, but must be mentioned here, merely to show that the Prebend of William de Pierrepoint must have been either Bridge-Walton, or Morville, as none other abutted on Tasley Manor. In October, 1203, William de Pierrepoint still holding C1Q this Prebend, the dispute was renewed, when amongst the defendant's interest in other relations, but because the date I assign to it is very different from that hitherto received.

Suffice it here to point out that these attestations of the deeds of the Stranges probably arose from a relationship to Simon de Pierrepoint, who was John le Strange's contemporary feoffee at Glazeley.

Its foundation on Prebendal lands, held immediately of the Crown, will probably have been nugatory, unless confirmed by the King. We have no evidence of such confirmation, and even if it were obtained from King Stephen, his act, of this kind, will hardly have bound his successors. HARPSFORD, alias HARPSWOOD. This vill is mentioned in King William's charter 262 to Salop Abbey, as one of the adjuncts involved in Earl Roger's grant of Morville Church to that house. The attestation of Alduin de Harpesfort to a very early deed of Salop Abbey (c. 1160), already quoted,263 seems to favour this assumption. If thus involved, we miss any subsequent notice of the place, probably as being comprised in that part of Morville itself which remained in connexion with the Church, and was not transferred to Astley Manor. But it must be noticed that the situation of Harpsford associates it much more with that district, which having been demesne of the Norman Earls became the endowment of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. Its tithes appear,264 in time of Henry VIII, as belonging to Salop Abbey, but are mentioned in such connexion as to leave it un certain whether they were tithes of the Abbot's own territory or not. 254 Kot.Pat.lEd.

The tithes of tbe vill of Moreffeld, of Walton and Leye, of Kyndesley, Aldenam, Harpisford, Haughton and Crofte, Underton, and of Morfeld parish, are enumerated in the order quoted ; and Walton, Leye, Aldenam, and Underton, were not of the Abbot's fee, whilst Morville (part), Kiuslow, Haughton, and Croft, were. No inference can therefore be drawn from this source as to the owner ship of Harpsford. LYE, alias LEYE, now LYE FARM. Though this was doubtless of the Prebeudal lands of St. Mary Magdalene of Bridgnorth, it is not quite clear that it belonged wholly to one particular Prebend, or, if it did, which that Prebend was. The vill is usually mentioned next to Walton, a circumstance which, as well as its situation, would associate it with that Prebend. However, in 1291, part of the temporalities of the Prebend of Under don consisted of a mill ; 265 and this I think must have been Lye Mill. All that has further occurred relative to the place has been mentioned above. ALDENHAM. As Aldenham was undoubtedly in the Domesday Parish of Mor ville, so also was it in all probability a member of the Domesday Manor, and part of those two hides which the Norman Earl retained in demesne. Its isolation in respect of other lands so retained is remarkable, and may be accounted for by its proximity to Shirlot 266 Forest, which I suppose was as great an object of interest to the Earls in their day, as to the Kings who came after. The family of Baskerville were, from the earliest times, the immediate tenants of the Crown in this Manor, but as they had other lands 2G7 in Shropshire with which they were more personally connected, we will here treat of their feoffees at Aldenham, a Therefore forests, in their very nature, were alien to the chief objects of the Sur vey. Hence the omission. The woods mentioned in the Shropshire Domesday are appurtenances of particular Manors with which they descended, and whose value they increased. 265 Yide supra, p. 77. 266 Neither this nor any other of the (afterward Royal) forests of Shropshire is mentioned in Domesday ; yet I conclude that they all existed and were of the demesne of the Earl.

The older name of the place was \"Aldreham,\" from two Saxon words, the first of which signifies an alder-tree, the last a home or sheltered habitation. About a.d. 1138, Fulcoins, whom I take to have held here under Baskerville, endowed c68 a chapel at Aldreham with sixty acres of land and a mansion. It was in \" the parish of the Church of Mamerfeld,\" and was consecrated by Bishop Robert de Betun, like other Chapels, because of the troubled state of the country. About the same time and on occasion of a similar foundation by Robert Fitz-Aher in the neighbouring village of Aston, Fulcaius de Aldreham appears among the witnesses of the Charter260 of endowment. In 1180 amongst those in this quarter who were fined 2T0 for imbladements by the Justice of the King's Forest the name Folqui appears. Early in the 13th century William de Aldeham attests one of Sibil de Teneray's Charters 2n to Morville Priory. September 29th, 1231. William de Aldenham had fined 272 with the Crown in a sum of 100*. It was for purchase of five acres of the wood of Chirlet (Shirlot) which he had assarted by license of the Verderers of the Forest. He will also pay 5 shillings annual rent for the same, and already renders account of two years' arrears of such rent. This annual rent would seem to have varied, for at Michaelmas, 1252, I find the Sheriff273 accounting (on behalf of William de Aldingham) 7s. 6d. for rent of five acres of the \" King's demesne in Aldingham,\" and, it is added, that the said William is \"to be quit of waste and regard.\" In 1255, the Jurors of Stottesden Hundred reported274 of this vill as follows : \u2014 William de Aldenham is Lord, and there is here one virgate of land which the same William holds in chief oi Walter de Baskerville, rendering one merk yearly to the same Walter, who is in custody of Sibil Giffard by grant of the King.

At the Forest-pleas of February, 1262, he appears 279 as one of the Regarders of the forests of Mors and Shirlet, and was, like many others, fined half a merk by the Justices for making a bad return.29\u00ae At the same time William le Wauwar of Aldenham, who ought to have been at the Assizes, was essoigned, because dead.281 On March 13th, 1262, William de Aldenham sat with the Ver derers and Foresters of the County on an Inquisition282 held at Bridgnorth, and which was to decide some forest question relating to Middleton Priors.

William Fitz-William failed to appear, and so the land was to be seized into the King's hand, and the cause adjourned till the morrow of St. Martin (November 12th). Afterwards, however, he appeared, but not being able to excuse his former default was adjudged to be in misericordia.-81 At the same Assizes the above-named WiUiam Wychard was sued 28S by Richard Wychard for a tenement in Aldenham. This prosecution was however withdrawn. On November 12th, 1272 (the day of adjournment of the former case), a fine289 was levied at Salop between Malcolumb de Harley, complainant, and Robert Jude, WUliam Wychard, and Michael Geune, deforciants, by Richard de Acton (their attorney, I suppose) .

The term amercement (originating in the same idea of merci) indicates a further process, viz. the penalty, as assessed by the Court or other competent authority. The term fine, when apphed to a pecuniary penalty, and as distinct from amercement, indicates a penalty, not arbitrary, but already fixed by statute. 289 Final Concords, 56 Hen. Ill, Salop.

THE CHAPEL. I have already mentioned the only notice which we have of this early foundation. It existed in all probability for a very short time, even if it was completed ; nor can I make out that Shrewsbury Abbey ever appropriated any part of the endowment of, or received any pension from, this Chapel. The Abbey's possession, in 1529, of the tithes of grain, hay, and other produce in Aldenham, was probably the result of Earl Hugh's long antecedent grant of the tithes of his demesnes. We have had former hints 298 that such grant must not be limited by the express words of Earl Hugh's Charter as preserved in the Monasticon. BRIDGNORTH.

As, however, the foundation of Bridgnorth was subsequent to Domesday, it may be consistent to postpone this subject for the present, not by any means that its importance is to be underrated, but rather because it affords matter for most diligent and exclusive consideration. Something, however, may here be said as to a Saxon foundation of the 10th century, variously described as a borough or a fortress, and assigned by very equally divided opinions to two locahties, viz., Bridgnorth and Quatford. The claim of Bridgnorth has been already aUuded to,299 but only in such a way as to leave the question open. This, however, is the proper place to give some account of the said Saxon foundation, if Bridgnorth were indeed its site ; but I must again postpone the subject, thinking, indeed, that Bridgnorth has a better claim than Quatford, but convinced that a third locality, Oldbury, was after all the real one. TASLEY.300 Lost among the Domesday contingents of MorviUe Manor come the two hides aUeged to have been held by Richard Pincerna imme diately of the Norman Earl. A probabUity, that, at the time of that Survey, Rainald the Sheriff was mesne tenant between the Earl and Richard Pincerna, has been fully stated before,301 as also that the said two hides were in Tasley and Henley. Rainald's presumed interest here, like aU his seigneuries, whether in Shropshire, Staffordshire, or elsewhere, descended to Fitz-Alan.

Of Richard Pincerna, assumed to have been Rainald's under tenant in 1086, nothing further occurs. The next, in his rela tive position, and as tenant of Fitz-Alan here, should be one of those who are named in the Liber Niger (1165) as holding by service of one muntator 302 (equal to half a Knight's fee) of the said barony of Fitz-Alan. Which of those, thus holding, was Lord of Tasley, is not apparent303 either from the list itself or any other forthcoming evidence. We have it however upon record that the tenant, thus holding Tasley, died during the minority of young Fitz-Alan, that is, before a.d. 1175, and that the heir, Roger Corbet, was then under age. The wardship of this heir, and custody 302 Vide Liber Niger, vol. i, p. 142 \u2014 where Hearne has a long note, attempting to define, but more successfully obscuring the peculiar nature of this tenure under the Barony of Fitz-Alan. His affectation of expounding, in classical and idiomatic Latin, a matter difficult in itself and every way unclassical in its associations, is but a pedantic substitute for the explanation which he was unable to supply, and, as transcriber of a record, was not caUed upon to offer. The question is of course the etymology of the word \" muntator,\" which Hearne will have to be equivalent to \" mundator,\" and to mean primarily, a moundman, miner, or pioneer, and he even suggests a tenure of about 200 acres as the muntator's fief. He then talks about the term as referable to naval mat ters, and finaUy proposes it as synonymous with \" vir montanus\" a mountaineer, \u2014 \"a signification,\" says he, \" most aptly squar ing with that part of Shropshire which is recovered from the Welsh and abounds in mountains.\" Passing the question whether any of Fitz-Alan's tenants in the Welsh Marches are registered in the Liber Niger, I shaU not, at least after quoting Hearne, seem superlatively absurd if I hazard another etymology. I suppose the word to be equivalent to munitator and coined from 'munitio \u2014 a fortress. If so, its meaning will be \u2014 one whose service was to do ward at his Lord's Castle. We shaU see how apposite such an interpretation will be in case of many a tenure under Fitz-Alan, the caput of whose barony was Oswestry. 303 There are three names on the list of Fitz-Alan's tenants, whose lands, held in 1165 by service of 1 muntator each, I -have nothing which enables me to identify. They are Roger Walensis, Nicholas Mau covenant, and John de Hanewode. The first of these I should conjecture to have been Lord of Tasley, had not the Histo rians of Shrewsbury (vol. i, p. 80, note 3) suggested that he (Roger Walensis) was identical with Roger de Powis. \" The latter was certainly never Lord of Tasley ; nor yet can I find that he or his descendants ever held anything under Fitz-Alan. On the other hypothesis (that Roger Walen sis was a different person from Roger de Powis, and, if so, possible Lord of Tasley in 1165) it wiU still remain unsettled whether he were the father of Roger Corbet and himself a Cadet of the Baronial House of Caus, or whether, dying without issue, his estate passed to Roger Corbet as his nearest of kin. Certain it is that Roger Corbet had Tasley by inheritance, hut whether through his Father or Mother we cannot say, nor can we point out his degree of connexion with the House of Caus. Contemporary with him was ano ther Roger Corbet, I say another because the latter was a younger brother of Richard Corbet (of Wattlesborough, I suppose), and could not in the ordinary course"], [128, "86 MORVILLE. of his lands, fell to the Crown in virtue of its temporary seizure of Fitz-Alan's barony. King Henry II granted it to Thomas Fitz- Odo, otherwise called Thomas de Chabbenour, and, in one304 instance (as having this wardship), Thomas de Tasley. Of this Thomas much more wUl be said elsewhere, but here only that which he had to do with Tasley. During his custody thereof, a suit about thirty acres of land arose between him and one who was officiating as Priest of the Pre bend, then held by WiUiam de Pierpoint in the CoUegiate Church of St. Mary Magdalene, in Bridgnorth Castle. King Henry II issued a precept ordering perambulation to be made between the lands of the Prebend and the lay-fee of Tasley. Thomas Fitz- Bernard, then Chief Justice of the King's Forests, had it in charge to effect this perambulation, which, with other evidence, will decide the date of the transaction as having been in 1180 or 1183. The result was in favour of the Church, as might be expected, seeing that the Crown had a permanent interest in the integrity of its own Prebend, but only a temporary one in Roger Corbet's Manor. Twenty years afterwards, when Roger Corbet, then of age, attempted by process of law to oust the same William de Pierpoint, the latter, inter alia, alleged this earlier settlement of the question. Corbet's rejoinder was to the effect that Thomas Fitz-Odo (called Thomas de Tasley) had not rightly represented him (or had wronged him) in the former cause. The case was dismissed sine die. This trial took place at the Salop Assizes in October, 1203 ; but Corbet had attained his majority some time previously, and had increased his importance by marriage with an heiress, who brought the Lord ships of Hadley and High Hatton, in Shropshire, of King's Bromley, in Staffordshire, and the patronage of Wombridge Priory, to him and his descendants. His career was short, but it will not be inconsistent with the importance of his successors if their descent, and a few notices 305 both of him and them, be here inserted. His marriage with Cecily, daughter and sole heir of Alan de inherit such a fee as Tasley. Yet these two brothers, Richard and Roger, may have been sons of different mothers, and the mother of Roger, the youngest, may have been heiress of Tasley. 304 Vide infra. 305 Mr. Blakeway's conjectures on the early history of this family (see S/ieriffs, p. 42) are put forward with confessed doubt and under a deficiency of documents.

Moreover, the same WUliam saith that he has no Church in Bruges, but only a certain Prebend in the Church of Bruges. Further he saith, that, by precept of the Lord King Henry, there was sometime perambulation made, between one Thomas de Tassele and the Priest of the said William, in presence of Thomas Fitz- Bernard, thereunto assigned, and in presence of many others, and that in virtue of such perambulation the aforesaid land remained with his Prebend; and if, after this (statement), the trial ought to proceed, he (WiUiam) will not decline it (non refutabit earn) .\" \u2014 \"And Roger (Corbet) saith nothing to contradict the statement of said William, nor saith he anything but that the forementioned Thomas, between whom and William the said perambulation took place, was his wronger313 (suit ablator suus).\" The decision of the Court on this cause was \" remanet sine die.\" We hear no more of the suit, and little more of the plaintiff, who died within a few months, leaving Cecily his widow and an infant son, Thomas, surviving. Before May 9th, 1204., Cecilia de Hadley had offered314 to King John sixty merks and a palfrey, by way of fine, for having seizin of the Manor of Bramley (Bromley Regis, Staff.), whereof she had been disseized by Geoffry Fitz-Piers, the Justiciar (Chief Justice of Eng land) . And she covenants to render for the same _\u00a34 per annum, and the service of a tenth part of a Knight (as the King's Charter, which she has, specifies 315) . Her fine also was, that she might marry at her own pleasure, and \"have custody of her son and his mar riage, so that he be not disparaged.\" The King's charter 3l6 alluded to bears date at Southwick (Hants) and is as follows : \u2014 \" John D. G., &c. Know ye that we have restored and conceded, and by this present charter confirmed to Cecily de Hedley, the whole Manor of Bromley, with its appur tenances as her right and inheritance, to hold to her and her heirs, of us and our heirs, for ever, rendering thereof, to us, four pounds yearly aud performing thereof, to us, service of the tenth 313 It does not seem quite clear what this expression implies \u2014 whether that Thomas de Tasley was at the time (i.e. circa 1180) unjustly occupying the whole Manor to the exclusion of the heir, or that he sacrificed the rights of his ward in this particular matter. the 5th year of John, in which the trans action took place, are lost. 315 These words were no part of the original fine, which, of course, preceded the Charter, but only a part of the sub sequent record of debt.

Dated 9th of May, in the fifth year of our reign.\" (May 9th, 1204.) Within four months after the granting of this charter, a fine 3l7 appears on the Rolls whereby \" Baldwin de Hodnet gives (to the King) sixty merks for having to wife Cecily who had been wife of Roger Corbet, with her land. And the Sheriff (of Staff.) has mandate to take security from him (Baldwin) as to the payment of the said sixty merks.\" Here the record is abruptly broken off, and there is a mark of cancellation added, for which a reason or reasons are sub joined in two contemporary notes. The first of these notes says briefly : \" Because above by the Wife herself;\" the second more fully : \" It is cancelled here because the same fine is elsewhere (entered), viz., in the Roll of Fines of the fifth year.\" These fines of the fifth year, we have already said, are lost ; nor do we in this instance need them. The truth is, that Cecily had married to Baldwin de Hodnet, and the latter had assumed her liabilities to the Crown. On the 8th of September, 1204, King John granted a further Charter318 to CecUy de Hedley, owing to some misunderstanding or informality about the first. This second Charter is dated at Oseney, and is generally as the first, but omits all correspondent mention of knight's service, and substitutes the following: \u2014 \"And let it not be to the injury of WUliam Fitz-Alan, of whom said Cecily holds a knight's fee, that we have given her to Baldwin de Hodnet, and that our former Charter (granted to her about Bromley) hath expressed the aforesaid service (_\u00a3 _\u2022 rent) and also a service of oue tenth of a knight's fee. On September 29th, 1204, Cecilia de Hadley is entered on the Sheriff's account S19 as owing \u00a34 of the rent of the Manor of Bromley (her first year's rent) . On September 29th, 1205, Baldwin de Hodnet is pardoned320 ten merks of his wife's debt to the Crown, and she is charged \u00a38 for two latter class. Her remarriage therefore and the wardship of her heir belonged to Fitz- Alan, and the acceptance of her Fine by King John, as weU as his consequent Charter, was an injury to her suzerain. Fitz-Alan's remonstrance probably pro duced the second Charter, which is merely a memorandum lest the first should con stitute a precedent. 319 Pipe Poll, 6 John, Salop. *?

I have done the best I can to give a translation of this Charter, which is not graimnatical in its construction. Its meaning is more obvious. The tenure of Bromley under the Crown was by a fee-farm rent, not by knight's service, whereas Cecily's tenure at Hadley, under Fitz-Alan, was of the"], [132, "90 MORVILLE. years' rent of Bromley ; but a memorandum is added to the latter entry, stating that she is answerable to the Sheriff, and that he accounts (in his general receipts) \" in corpore comitatus.\" Bromley Regis thus continued to be held of the Crown by Cecilia and many generations of her heirs ; \u2014 but we must revert to the more immediate history of Tasley. At Salop Assizes, November, 1221, Margery de Chabbenour names321 an attorney in her suit about dower against Baldwin de Hodnet and his wife. At the same time Baldwin de Hodnet and Cecilia his wife name322 their attorney against Margery de Chabbenour. The cause between them is also stated, as foUows : 323 Margery, widow of Thomas Fitz-Odo, sues Thomas Corbet for a third of two parts of the Manor of Tasseleg, and sues Baldwin de Hodnet and CecUy his wife for a third of the third part of the same Manor. Her suit is for dower. It proves that Thomas Corbet was of age, and had succeeded to Tasley, his paternal inheritance ; while his mother Cecily was stUl living and holding her dower therein, as derived from Roger Corbet, her former husband. For a third of their respective interests they are impleaded by Margery de Chabbenour, and the progress of the cause wUl show on what grounds. Baldwin and Cecilia, on their parts, caUed Thomas Corbet to warrantry. He appeared, vouched the warrantry, and, on the part of himself aud them, further caUed to warrantry John Fitz-Alan (his suzerain) . A day was given to the parties at Warwick, on the morrow of St. Hilary (January 14th, 1222) . On the said day, at Warwick,324 John Fitz-Alan essoigned himself in the plea of dower against Margery de Chabenour, in which Thomas Corbet called him to warrantry. The cause was adjourned to fifteen days of Easter, then to be heard at Westminster. Some further and unrecorded adjournments wiU have taken place, but we have fortunately a record of the final hearing as it took place at Westminster in HUary Term, 1223. The process was as follows : 325 \" A Jury comes here to say, if Thomas Fitz-Odo, formerly husband of Margery de Chalbenour, held, on the day he espoused her, the Manor of Taslegh in fee, so that he could dower her in one-third thereof or not ; or if the said Thomas held it of the bailiwick of the 321 Salop Assize-Roll, 6 Hen.

Lord King Henry, the King's grandfather, whilst William Fitz- Alan, father of John Fitz-Alan, was under age, and in custody of the King, together with that land. Because both John Fitz-Alan, against whom the aforesaid Margery claims the said third in dower, and she herself have put themselves on this Jury.\" \"The Jurors do not understand that Thomas could dower Margery. because he did not so hold as that he could dower her, -for he had no ingress except through the Bailiffs of King Henry when William Fitz-Alan was under age.\" It was decided (by the Court) that John be herein quiet and Margery in misericordia. We must again revert to the Salop Assizes of November, 1221, when Thomas Corbet was party to another suit.326 The Abbot of Shrewsbury sued him for a quarter of a virgate in Kinslow and a similar quantity of land in Midwele (Meadowley) in right of his Church. Thomas pleaded that he ought nor to answer, because, in Kinslow, he neither held nor claimed anything ; and this the Abbot could not deny. So Thomas was declared quit. It is probable that very soon after this time Thomas Corbet's mother died. Her inheritance did not, however, immediately devolve to him, for having been also a mother by Baldwin de Hodnet, her second husband, the latter wiU have held it for life. He, however, was dead also before January 2lst, 1225. 32T At this juncture the question naturaUy arose as to who was CecUia de Hadley's heir. The Sheriff of Staffordshire had the King's precept to hold inquest thereon, which being done and returned to Court, the King issued a mandate 328 to the same Sheriff ordering him to give Thomas Corbet seizin of Bromley, taking seemity from him for his relief, which was \u00a34. This mandate bears date 19th February, 1225. There is abundant evidence not only of Thomas Corbet having held Bromley,329 but also of his succession to Hadley, High Hatton, and the patronage of Wombridge Priory. He stands first witness of a grant 33\u00b0 to the latter house which bears date about 1228-9. There are three Usts of John Fitz-Alan's Barony in the Testa de Nevill,331 nearly contemporary with each other and of date about 1240-1. In one of these Thomas Corbet is entered as holding Tasley by service of half a knight ; in the other two, Thomas Corbet of 326 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

It would seem to be he who in 1242, having been fermor of Hintlesham (Suffolk), and being put in charge at the Exchequer for \u00a350. on that account, gave the King a palfrey to have judgment thereupon.332 He died in 1247, holding the Manor of Bromley, in capite of the Crown, at a fee-farm rent of \u00a34. The said Manor was worth \u00a311. 10s. per annum. His next heir was his son Roger, then twenty-five years of age.333 On the 28th of August, 1247, the King, at Windsor, received the homage of the said heir, and it was enjoined to Henry de Wingeham and his co-escheater in Staffordshire to give him seizin of Bromley, taking security for a relief of ten merks (\u00a33. 6*. 8d.), to be paid at Easter and Michaelmas, 1248. 334 Roger Corbet, immediately on his succession, seems to have been involved in a dispute 335 with the Prior of Wombridge as to the right of patronage of that house. The details belong to another locality; but it may be here stated that the right under certain limitations was conceded to Corbet. In 1255, the status of the Manor of \"Tassele\" is thus set forth by the Jurors of Stottesden Hundred.336 \"Roger Corbet is Lord, and there are here eight virgates (equal to two hides) of land. They do no suit either to County or Hundred nor pay stretward or motfee the Jurors know not by what warrant. And he holds in chief of John Fitz-Alan for half a knight's fee.\" These immunities are paralleled in no other of Fitz-Alan's neighbouring Manors. Doubt less they arose from the original tenancy of Richard Pincerna having been in the privileged demesne-lands of MorviUe Manor. At the Salop Assizes of January, 1256, the Jurors for Bradford Hundred returned Roger Corbet among those who, being of fuU age and holding a whole knight's fee, were not yet knighted.337 332 Originalia, 26 Hen.

On the 15th of May, 1259, he was deceased, and the inquest338 which sat on that day reported his tenure in capite at Bromley as well as that his son and next heir, Thomas, would be eleven years of age on the vigil of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 13), next coming. On October 10th, 1259, the King's Mandate3^ to the Sheriff of Salop affirms, that, because of Roger Corbet's tenure in capite and death, first seizin of aU his lands, of whomsoever held, pertains to the Crown : and therefore the Sheriff is to seize them into the King's hand and commit them to custody of the King's Escheator in the said County tiU the King command otherwise. At the Forest Assizes of February, 1262,340 and therefore during the minority of young Thomas Corbet, there was an Inquisition by the Vederers, Regarders, and Foresters of the County, as to \"whether the wood of Tasley, which is called The Hoc, and is within the bounds of the King's Forest, be within regard or not.\" The decision was that it was out of regard, and always had been, and that the Lord of Tasley sold the vesture 341 of the said wood in portions, whenever he willed, and that the said wood is now being sold (modo revenit). At the same Assizes, and apparently in conse quence of this verdict, several persons who stood on the list of amercements342 for vert, instead of having the usual fine of a shilling placed opposite their names have the words \" extra regard \" written instead, signifying their acquittal. Of these are William de Fraxino, of Tasley, Henry de Tassewood, WiUiam Granger de Tasley, PhUip de Tassewood, and three others who seem to have been their pledges. At the same Assizes,343 Roger Corbet, of Hadley (having died nearly three years before), appears on the list, entitled \" Essonia Mortis,\" as before alluded to. Also Duce Corbet, of Hadley, and Hugh Corbet, of Tasley, appear on the list of common essoigns.

At the Forest Assizes346 of November, 1271, Thomas Corbet, of Hadley, was convicted of taking one stag, near Clotlegh (under the Wrekin) . At the County Assizes347 of October, 1272, Thomas Corbet, of Tasley, acknowledges a debt of \u00a35 as due to Adam de Chetwynd. At the same time he is returned 348 by the Stottesden Jurors as one of those who, being of full age and holding a knight's fee, was still not knighted ; and he was also a defaulter in due attendance at the said Assizes. About 1284, Thomas Corbet is returned349 as holding Tasley of Richard Fitz-Alan of the honour of White Minster (Oswestry), by half a knight's fee, and said Richard holds of the King in capite. Shortly afterwards, Dominus Thomas Corbet is witness to a Wombridge Charter,360 which prefix to his name is usually taken to be equivalent to a title of Knighthood. At the Salop Assizes of October, 1292, he stood as pledge 351 for John Fitz-PhUip, Lord of Bobington, then under prosecution of the Crown in a cause of Quo Warranto, and was himself made the subject of a presentment, which placed him in the same predicament.353 The Stottesden Jurors reported him as claiming to hold his free 345 Calendar Rot.

Here he pleaded King John's Charter of the Manor to Cecily de Hadley and her heirs, and that such liberties were always annexed to the said Manor both before and since King John's grant. Hugh de Louther denied that such liberties could attach to any Manor, or that any one could claim them without special warrant from the Crown, and whereas Corbet's Charter made no mention of such liberties, he asked judgment for the King. This cause was adjourned, to be heard before the King himself on the morrow of Ascension Day. About this time Thomas Corbet had a suit 3i6 against Robert de Turbeville, Canon of St. Mary Magdalene, of Bridgnorth, about lands in Tasley, which said Robert claimed in right of his Prebend. In 26 Edward I, 1298, a fine357 was levied between Walter de Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and Thomas Corbet, of Tasley, defendant, of the advowson of the Church and Manor of Tasley. The right remained to the Bishop and his heirs. This fine implies, I presume, the sale of all Corbet's interest here, though the distinctive name of Corbet of Tasley358 was retained by his family for some time after. We will follow the last, who properly bore that name, to the close of his career, which was near at hand. He accounts 359 as Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire for half the fiscal year ending Michaelmas, 1298, and again, for the full year ending Michaelmas, 1299 ; but dying in office, his son and heir Sir Roger accounts for the half year ending Easter, 1300 ; the King's precept ordering the usual inquisition s6\u00b0 on the death of a tenant in capite, issued May 10th, 1300.

THE CHAPEL OR CHURCH OF TASLEY. About a.d. 1138, when Robert de Betun, Bishop of Hereford, granted to Salop Abbey an appropriation of the Church of Mor viUe, he included certain pensions due from the Chapels subject to the said Church. Amoug the said pensions was one of half a merk due from the \" Chapel of Tasseley.\" 361 There is a certificate 363 in the Salop Chartulary as to an agree ment, which must have been arrived at about a.d. 1190, and to which Hugh Abbot of Shrewsbury and the Lord William Fitz- Alan were chief parties. It concerned the land of Hinele (Henley) and the right of presentation to the Chapel of Tasley. It was agreed that William Fitz-Alan and his heirs should hold the land of Hinele with its appurtenances, paying a rent of 2*. per annum to the Abbot. It was also agreed that WiUiam Fitz-Alan was to have the right of presentation to Tasley Chapel, but that the Clerk then holding said Chapel, as well as his successors, was to pay an annual pension of half a merk to the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury, \"that is to their Church of ZMomerfeld,\" and to do fealty to said Abbot, as regarded said payment, before institution. The Abbot granted to the said Parson of Tasley the tithes of Henley, the Parson paying 1*. annually for the same to the Abbot, and undertaking for himself and successors to swear fealty (in this matter) to the Church of Salop. The witnesses to this agreement were W. (Wm. de Vere) d. g. Bishop of Hereford, Master Robert of Salop (consecrated Bishop of Bangor in 1196-7), and Warin de CasteUo. In 1293, the Church of Tasseley e in Stottesden Deanery was not of \u00a3i value to the Incumbent.353 The portion (or pension) of the Prior of Momerfeld iu the same is stated at 7*. 8d.

But the Corbets of Bromley bore occasionally, and as a quar tering, what they must have held to be their paternal coat. It was charged with three ravens ; a circumstance which should have its weight in any future conjecture as to their cadency from the parent house, or their relations to any other branch thereof.367 HENLEY. Of this vill, as has before been hinted, Warin, the Sheriff, was Lord before the time of Domesday. He gave,368 towards the con struction of Shrewsbury Abbey, two-thirds of the tithes of his demesnes of Hennele, &c. ; and this grant was recited and con firmed by Earl Hugh, if we may so far trust a less suspicious Charter than that before 3fi9 alluded to. About 1138, Robert (de Betun), Bishop of Hereford, confirming3'0 to Shrewsbury Abbey, classifies under the head of tithes, which had been anciently given by great men in his diocese to the \"sustenta tion\" of said Abbey, two parts of the tithes of the Lord 371 (or demesne 371) of Heneleg. Between a.d. 1148 and 1164, G. (Gilbert), Bishop of Hereford, confirming 3?2 to the same Abbey \" tithes granted in his diocese to the construction of the Church by good men,\" includes tithes of the demesne of Heneleg. Ralph, the Dean, and the Canons of the Chapter of the Church of Hereford, inspected, recited, and confirmed3?3 the last deed. These tithes of Henley have already been mentioned as having been given up to the Incumbent of Tasley about a.d. 1190. The deed to Bishop Oeoffry (1115-1119), but against strong internal evidence. The in consistency seems to have been recognized by Mr. Blakeway,\u2014 but in attributing the deed to Bishop Odes (de Braose) he seems to have forgotten that, in that case, the initial letter E would have been employed in a Latin deed, Egidius being the Latin of Giles (Vide Hist.

It is a certificate by Egidius (Giles de Braose), Bishop of Hereford, that disputed tithes of Weston and of the demesne of Henel belong to Salop Abbey.

There is a third charter of Earl Hugh (No. 4 in the Salop Chartulary) which is very different from the two others in many respects, and especially in having a consistent testing clause.

A place in Warwickshire, which has settled into a similar modern form, stands in Domesday, with stiU greater etymological correct ness, as Hardintone.1 The period and circumstance of Harding's interest here have no other record than is implied by his Saxon name. In King Edward the Confessor's time this Manor belonged to Saint Milburg, that is, to the Monastic House at Wenlock, which was dedicated to her memory. On the forfeiture of the Earls of Mercia in 1071, aud the consequent revolution in this County, the rights of St. MUburg at Eardington seem to have been disregarded, and the Manor appropriated by the Norman Earl himself. In 1086, like other Manors of the said Earl's demesne, its Hundred is not recorded, but situation and tenure are alone sufficient to place it in Alnodestreu. It is noticed in Domesday thus : \" \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Ardintone. Saint Milburg held it in time of King Edward. Here are 5 hides.

In time of King Edward the (annual) value (of the Manor) was 40s., now it is 30s.\" Thc Borough or Town of Quatford, and the Earl's Castle there (which, in its early stage, might very possibly be set down as merely a house), were therefore, in 1085, part of the Manor of Eardington, and destined in a short period to much greater importance. There is a legendary tale about Quatford, which is so perfectly consistent with Domesday, that, while adding to that Record an unusual interest, itself becomes stamped with a grand mark of probabUity. To arrive at this coincidence in due chronological order, we must first speak separately of Quatford, a place whose history will, for the present, take us back to a period much earlier than Domesday. <&uatforti+ The name of this place is referable to the vast forest (coed) which thirteen centuries ago covered the whole adjacent district, and which has since been represented by the great, but never equal, Forest of Mors. The British Coed is remembered in the name of another village, viz., Quat,- \u2014 where, however, the uncompounded form has been curiously reassumed. The Saxon era had accurately distinguished these two localities according to then existing circumstances. That part of the forest which was occupied as a viUage became Cpaccun (Cwattun, i.e. Quat-town), and Quatone was accordingly the name of Quat when Domesday was written. Another part, not yet colonized, the Saxons called Cpacj:o]ib (Cwatford), in allusion to an adjacent and passable part of the river Severn. In the autumn of 896, King Alfred and the men of London blocked up, or stranded, a Danish fleet which had ascended the Thames and the Lea. The Danes, despairing of their ships, forsook them, sought an asylum for their wives in East Anglia, and marched overland to a place (afterwards'1) called Quat-bridge, on the Severn. 4 See the Saxon Chronicle, which says I Cpa_bpc3e be S\u00e6jrej-.n (to Cwatbricgeby (sub anno 896) that the Danes came sec \\ Severn). See also Florence of Worcester!"], [149, "105 QUATFORD. Here they intrenched themselves and passed the winter. In the following summer (897) they separated; part of them returning into East Anglia, the others going into Northumberland. No remains of this Danish fortification at Quatford are now traceable, and it may be doubted whether the exact spot occupied by their army was identical with the site of the present village. An adjacent ford of the Severn still retains the name of Danesford, and corroborates the story of their visit to the neighbourhood. In the year 913, \u00c6gelfleda, Queen of the Mercians, built a fortress in a place which, in Florence of Worcester's time, was called Brycge.5 who says, \" locum qui Quatbrycge dicitur j pedestres celeri fuga petunt.\" the time when he was writing. This is not the only instance which I have met with, where the ipsissimaverba of Florence convey a truth not deducible from any extant copy of the Saxon Chronicle. I refer to both these authorities, be cause it is quite clear to me that though Florence of Worcester derived his infor mation from a Saxon Chronicle, it was from a different MS. to any now extant ; and, I almost dare add, a more authentic one. I cannot subscribe to all which the Editors of the Saxon Chronicle have claimed for it. H indeed it was originaUy the work of successive annaUsts, each giv ing the history of his own time, such original texts must in many instances have been interpolated by more modern tran scribers. I believe we have a case before us. I cannot suppose for an instant that in the year 896 there was a bridge over the Severn at or near Quatford, nor that, if there were, would a contemporary Saxon have described it as \" Cwatbricge by Severn,\" words which are only referable to a period when there was both a bridge and a viUage in the locality. Again, if Quatford were only Quatford in 1085, and if the next ford of the Severn still witnesses the circumstance of the Danish visit in its name of Danes/o/--!, how is it supposable that such local ad vantages would have been memorialized, even in a name, at a period when (if we read the Saxon Chronicle literally) there was the adjacent and greater commodity of a bridge ? All we can safely conclude on this sub ject is then, that the Danes in 896, having lost their fleet, came and wintered in the forest by the Severn ; and Florence of Worcester, two centuries after, understood the place then caUed Quatbridge, to have been the site of their encampment. Then object in coming to \" the forest by the river\" when they had lost then- ships is obvious. The word \"bridge\" is therefore an in terpolation by some one transcribing the older document at a time when there was a bridge at Quatford, and which was probably not till the end of the eleventh century. 5 Vide Sax. Chron. sub anno 912, and Flor. Wigom. sub anno 913. Where again Florence is the most accurate. In rejecting Quatford as the Brug of Ethel fleda, we need not rely only upon a balance of conflicting testimony. Probability is also strongly in our favour; for we have every reason to believe that Quatford, or rather its site, as involved in Eardington, was part of the original endowment of St. Milburg. If so, there is little likelihood that a Saxon Queen should have intruded her Castle upon the domain of a Saxon Florence of Worcester, on the other hand, using the same original authority and writing, as we know, in the very be ginning of the twelfth century, inter polates the same passage much more truly and intelligibly. He describes the Danes as flying to the place (not town) which is caUed Quatbridge \u2014 that is, caUed so al"], [150, "106 QUATFORD. This foundation has often been identified with Quatford, so often, that, however erroneous the tradition be, it requires this passing mention. The best authority places \u00c6gelfleda's foundation on the Western Bank of the Severn, and we must seek it there. The next notice which we have of Quatford introduces the Legend already alluded to, and which, while it professes to tell how this spot was selected for the foundation of a great Collegiate Church, may inferentially be taken to account for the origin of both a Castle and a Borough. This story is contained in a Chronicle, either written or procured to be wrjtten by John Bromton, Abbot of Jorval, in the reign of King John. As the whole passage is to our purpose it shall he given at length, and, as nearly as a translation will permit, in the writer's words. The death of Earl Roger de Montgomery having been described, the narrative proceeds as foUows :\u00b0 \u2014 \" This Roger in his lifetime and the said Adelissa his wife did build a church in honour of the blessed Mary Magdalene, in Quad ford, in the county of Salop, one mile from Bruggenorth. Of which building the cause, as is said, was this : \u2014 When forsooth the said Lady Adelissa, at mandate of the said Earl her husband, was first coming to him from beyond sea into England, and was on her voyage, lo ! such a storm of wave and wind shook the vessel that she and her suite, when now the mariners were in despair, looked for nothing but shipwreck. And when a certain priest of the said Countess, wearied by over- watching, had fallen, as God willed, into slumber, he saw in his sleep a certain matron standing nigh to him and speaking thus \u2014 ' If thy lady would wish to save herself and her attendants from the present dreadful danger of sea, let her make a vow to God and faithfully promise to build a church in honour of the blessed Mary Magdalene on the spot where she may first happen to meet her husband, the Earl, in England; and specially where there groweth a hollow oak and the wdd swine have shelter.' 1 \" And when the priest awoke he told each particular of the vision Saint, though the forest-loving Norman and the heathen Dane had less or no such scruple. may have been an artificial one. Some occasional receptacle wiU have been neces sary for the vast herds of swine which were driven into the greater forests during the season of pannage. I do not remem ber that Gurth had such accommodation, but the house of Cedric was near enough to afford nightly shelter to him and his charge. 6 Chron. Joh. Bromton inter x Scrip tores, page 988. 7 I take a liberty in the translation of this passage. The original is \" Et pr\u00e6 cipue ubi concava quercus cum tigurio porcorum crescit.\" The visionary shed"], [151, "107 QUATFORD. to his lady. Who, when she had heard and vowed to fulfil all things, the tempest being presently calmed, soon arrived with her attendants at the desired shore. And she, toUing through many days travel from the sea towards her lord, met him first at Quatford, which was then desert, in the spot where the very oak was growing and he hunting. And him she forthwith besought that he would aid her to fulfil the vow which she vowed in her danger as to building a Church in honour of the blessed Mary Magdalene. And he acquiescing in the vows of his wife built, with her, the aforesaid Church, which, though then he endowed it with great possessions, yet now with aUits rights and appiu'tenanees seemeth to be subject to the free Royal Collegiate Chapel situate in the Castle of Brug genorth and endowed with one Deanery and five Prebends out of the aforesaid possessions. The which Deanery and Prebends the King indeed conferreth of his own right and custom ; although, in nearly all other Collegiate Chapels, the Deans, being installed by the Sheriff at the King's coUation, and inducted into corporal possession of the Deaneries, confer aU Prebends in the same Chapels and install, induct, and visit the Prebendaries. But, in the aforesaid Chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene, the Dean confers no Prebend, nor visits Prebend or Prebendary ; but each, in the corps of his own Prebend, hath and exerciseth plenary jurisdiction as well in things spiritual as in things temporal.\" The whole of this narrative is credible in itself and minutely consistent with other ascertained facts ; nor need we take exception even to the Priest's dream, for who knows not that the feverish sleep of over-fatigue will invest our previous hopes and anxieties with some garb of life-like reabty. Moreover this Priest lived at a time when Priests were taught to believe in and to expect such special revelations of the divine will. Parts of this story, nevertheless, require explanation ; and the whole of it must be tested by other facts and dates before we admit it to that credence which the details of a legend most seldom deserve. Mabil, first Countess of Earl Roger de Montgomery, was mur dered at Buris, a town on the river Dive in Normandy, and buried on Dec. 5, 1082, at Troarn.8 The Earl's second marriage to Adelais daughter of Ebrard de Pusey, one of the chief nobles of France, must have followed immediately; for their only son, Ebrard de Montgomery, was old enough to frequent the Court of WUliam 8 Ordericus VitalU, page 578."], [152, "108 QUATFORD. Rufus (who died in 1100) and to attest (as Ebrard Fitz Count) a charter9 of Henry I, which must have passed in June 1107. More over Earl Roger mentions his Countess Adelais in a charter10 which dates in or before 1085. The arrival of this lady in England wiU therefore have been in 1083-4. At that time Quatford was desert, and the Earl was hunting on the spot where afterwards stood the Church. This is in every way consistent with other facts, for we know that Quatford in after times, constituted a limit of the great Forest of Mors. That the Earl should found a Church at solici tation of his second wife is only an instance of what Ordericus says generally of this lady in contrast to the Countess Mabil, \u2014 \" for she excelled in understanding and in piety, and oft persuaded her Lord to befriend Monks and to relieve the poor.\" That the Earl, having resolved on such foundation, and in such a spot, should combine with it other plans, is most reasonable, for an isolated place of worship in Mors Forest would have been an idea little in keeping with a Collegiate Church, though well suited for a Hermitage or even a Monastery. Hence we have the Borough and incipient Castle of 1085, re corded in Domesday ,- hence also the bridge which, in Florence of Worcester's time, had caused the locality to be caUed Quat-bridge rather than Quat-ford. Domesday says nothing of the Church, but such an omission is perfectly reconcileable with the progress of a building not yet consecrated or endowed. We next come to the ceremony of consecration and the contem porary charter of foundation. The very day of the former is fixed by an unvouched authority,11 which is in itself of weight, and is supported by other evidence. The day thus given is July 22, 1086, and two independent facts corroborate it. Robert, Bishop of Chester, who (a_ we shall see) was present, was not nominated to his See till Dec. 25, 1085. It was also \"in time of King William\" (as the contemporary Charter declares), and this undistinctive appellation should mean the Conqueror rather than his son Rufus. These two considerations would reduce the date to 1086 or 1087. Moreover, July 22 (the day alleged) was St. Mary Magdelene's Day. When an unvouched date wUl thus bear testing, it would be absurd not to adopt it. 0 New Monasticon, vol. vi, p. 144, II. 10 Ord.

The richly endowed Church naturally followed ; but whether in his time, or by subsequent direction of King Henry I, we are not informed. It was already at Bridgnorth on the accession of Henry II. What we have further to say of Quatford will be chiefly as an appanage rather than the site of this great Collegiate establishment. In the thirteenth century we have several notices of smaU occu pations, both in Quatford and Eardington, and so on either or both sides of the river Severn. The persons thus interested were probably tenants of the Church. A few shaU be mentioned here, and others reserved for Eardington, to which we shall shortly recur. At Salop Assizes, Nov. 1221, Simon de Quatford sued Andrew de More for twenty acres here, aUeging that Andrew obtained entry through WiUiam de More his father, which WUliam was only tenant for a term by demise of Reginald de Quatford, Simon's father. Andrew pleaded that he was only tenant of half the premises, for that Alan de Pierpoint held ten acres thereof by gift of the same Reginald. Alan, being in Coiu't, proved the truth of this by production of the deed of feoffment, whereupon Simon was non-suited.38 About the same time WiUiam Fitz Henry, of Brug (Bridgnorth), granted to WiUiam his son twenty-four acres in Quatford. There were witnesses to this grant, WUliam Goldsmith (Aurifaber) and Adam Logain, Provosts of Brug, and Hamo le Palmer.39 About 1260, John Fitz WiUiam Fitz Henry, of the Castle of Brug, warranted to John de Exton, Clerk, twenty-four acres in Quatford, which said John de Exton had purchased of WUliam brother of the warrantor. There were witnesses of this, William Bonami and Richard Ardnichun, Provosts of Brug. Walter Palmer and WUliam Palmer.40 About 1280.41 John de Exton, Clerk, surnamed Citator (the Summoner), sold to Richard Dammas, of Brug, Chaplain, land m the field opposite Quatford.

At Salop Assizes44 \" Richard Dammas was bound down to answer to the Lord the King, for that when Nicholas Brun and Alice his wife, on Oct. 4, 1291, in the town of Brugges, in the Church of St. Leonard, in presence of Master Andrew de Totten hale, Hugh de Wrottesley, and WiUiam Godewyn, had served the said Richard with a writ of the King forbidding him to prosecute further in Court Christian a suit concerning chattels and debts, which were neither of testament nor marriage, the aforesaid Richard, in contempt of the said precept, spat upon the writ and cast it under him and trampled it with his feet in contempt of the Lord King, of -\u00a31000, &c. \"Richard denies the whole charge, and puts himself on the country, &c.

QUATFORD PARISH CHURCH AND INCUMBENTS. Though Quatford Church ceased to be Collegiate within a few years of its foundation, it nevertheless remained, having for its parish a district identical with the Domesday Manor of Eardington. The contrast which it thus presented to its former self is most remarkable. As a Collegiate Church its foundation rests on the clearest evidence : the earliest feature of its parochial state is two centimes of aU but oblivion. Sir William de Chetinton, its Chaplain, just mentioned, was probably the earliest Incumbent of whom we are likely to hear, and his Incumbency, if such it can be called, very much like that of the Chaplains of Morville and Astley Abbots, of whom we have heard air e adv.

Claverley,\" and the Church of Claverley was always attached to the Deanery or chief Prebend of St. Mary Magdalene, of Brug. Whether this summary notice of Quatford alludes to the Church, or to some lands in the parish, does not appear from the context of the passage quoted. In 1291 51 we just know that there was a Church here, from being told that it was not worth \u00a34 per annum, and so not taxable. Possible mention of another Incumbent here, in 1316, may have been already made.53 If so, he was called Parson, \u2014 but that may have been the result of his more valuable preferment elsewhere. In 1341, the village of Quatford53 is mentioned as having been taxed to the ninth, according to the value of the Parish Church, and so excepted from the general taxation of Bridgnorth, though within the Uberties of that Borough. This separate taxation of Quatford does not however occur any where on the Roll. It was probably never levied, as we know from other authority 54 that the lands of St. Mary Magdalene paid nothing to this tax. The ' Valor Ecclesiasticus ' of 1535 makes no mention of Quat ford Church in any relation whatever. ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS OF THE OLD CHURCH. The outside of this Church exhibits no architectural details earlier than about the fourteenth century, with the exception of a small window on the north side of the Chancel. The Chancel-arch is also of late Norman or transitional character; but there seems reason to believe that the present Church preserves the ground plan of the original structure, I mean that which existed in the twelfth century, the western tower having been added at a later period ; for the Chancel-arch is built of a sort of tufa/5 and the same is found in the walls of both the Nave and Chancel, the masonry of which, near the ground, is such as we might look for in that period. The tower, and some of the upper parts of the walls, including the windows, are of sandstone. 51 Pope Nicholas' Taxation, page 166. 62 Vide supra, page 77, note 253. 53 Inq.

The Font is a circular basin, on a cluster of four short massive shafts. The ornament with which it is enriched gives so completely the tracery and panelling of the fourteenth century, that I cannot refer it to any other period, and the material is sandstone, not the tufa of the Chancel- arch and walls. It is, however, not impossible that the ornament may have been sculptured upon an old and plain basin. Near the door are some incised and sculptured slabs of stone, representing a sort of cross : they seem to have belonged to altar tombs. J. L. Petit. \u20acatfrutjjtott+ We now recross to the western bank of the Severn, where lay the bulk of the Domesday Manor of Eardington. This we have already seen appropriated by the Norman Earl, and granted to his Church of Quatford, but not without a compensation to the Saxon house of St. Milburg, then represented by Wenlock Priory. Eardington hereupon became divided into two portions, allotted to two staUs of the Earl's Prebendal Church. With one of these was associated the Church of Alveley, \u2014 and, consequently, that Prebend was usually caUed the Prebend of Alveley, while the other was always known as the \u2014 PREBEND OF EARDINGTON. Ulger, the first whom I find with this preferment, lived in the time of King Henry II. As early as 1169, Hulger, the Clerk, was one of the Visors appointed 56 by writ of Richard de Luci to super intend works at the Tower of Brug. Ulger, variously caUed Clerk and Canon, discharged a similar trust in 1170 and four following years, under writs 57 both of Richard de Luci and the King. present and similar instances their duty was not only to see that the works were properly performed, but to check the Sheriff's expenditure thereon. 56 Pipe Poll, 15 Hen.

Pantulf s tenure of this Prebend wUl also have been very brief ; for, as we shall see presently, his predecessor's 58 name was used to describe the Prebend when his successor was appointed. On Nov. 1, 1203, King John, then at VerneuU,59 certifies Geoffrey, Bishop of Coventry, that \" we have conceded, and, so far as the patron is concerned, given to Alexander, Chaplain of our be loved WiUiam de Breose, that Prebend in our Chapel of Bruges which is vacant and is of our donation, which Ulger, and after him R., son of Hugh Pantulf, held.

Wherefore we command you that you admit the said Alexander to the Parsonage, and the said R. to the perpetual Vicarage of that Prebend, and institute them on our presentation aforesaid.\" 2 Feb. 1206, King John, at Nottingham/0 addressing the Dean of Brug, informs him that he has granted to Master John Wtheng that Prebend in his (the King's) Church of Brug, which is vacant and was Wlger the Canon's. The Dean is to admit him and do therein whatever pertains to him to do. 6 June, 1226. Henry de Cornhull, Chancellor of London, is presented61 to that Prebend in the King's Chapel of Brug, which had been Master Wyteng's. The Constable of Brug is to induct him. 58 Ulger, a Canon, was living in Oct. 1203, and possessed of a free tenement in Brokton, whereof William deBrokton had disseized him. ( Yid.

There are two points noticeable in this presentation : \u2014 1st, that the Peculiar Ju risdiction, afterwards so jealously guarded by the Crown, seems either forgotten or not fully established, otherwise a Bishop would not have been addressed : 2dly, that the Bishop addressed is of Coventry, showing that the ancient diocese of Chester crossed the Severn at this one point to include Eardington, a boundary which, though sometimes ignored, was again recognized in the Valor of Henry Yin.

In giving a list of the early Prebendaries of this other portion of Eardington we necessarUy include some account of the Church of Alveley, whose Incumbents held this dignity. The first whom I find thus beneficed was WiUiam le Strange, probably a near relation of Guy le Strange, who became Lord of Alveley by grant72 of Henry II in 1155. In Oct. 1203, Christiana, widow of Richard de Constantin, had disseized WUliam le Strange of his free tenement in Erdinton since Michaelmas 1199. WUliam recovered seizin and 3 shUlings damages.73 In Nov. 1221, WUliam le Strange was returned7* as holding the Church of Alveley, having been presented thereto by King Henry II. It was worth 30 merks (\u00a320). He wiU therefore have held this Prebend thirty-three years at least, but on Jan. 7, 1223, he had resigned, for on that day King Henry III conferred the Church on William de Harcourt, who wiU also have been related to one of the then co-heirs of Alveley Manor. On this occasion the Bishop of Coventry was ordered to institute. Notwithstanding this resignation of WUliam le Strange he was presented 75 at Salop Assizes in Oct. 1227 as holding the Church of Alveley. The mistake arose probably from the identity of Christian 72 Cart. Cotton, xi. 14, in Brit. Mus. witnesses ; but the Chartulary at Sundorn, quoting, I think, the same original deed, has John le Strange and Wido (Guy) his brother as witnesses. A William le Strange is indeed a witness of two other deeds in the Haghmon Chartulary, and him I take to have been our Prebendary, and perhaps afterwards Dean of St. Mary's ; but both these deeds passed after the deaths of Guy and John le Strange the elder. I think that there is a further mistake, in the Hist, of Shrews bury, in giving this William a daughter ; aud that it was his sisterwhomarried Alan le Poer.

More over these Prebendaries of Bridgnorth will not usually have been resident, but rather represented by their several Vicars. If so, the Jurors, who made these presentments at County Assizes, may very possibly have remained ignorant of the resignation of any Preben dary for some time after such event.

The Alveley jurors said 80 that Henry de Wingham held the Church by the King's gift ; that it belonged to a Prebend of the King's free Chapel, and was worth forty merks (\u00a326. 13*. M. per annum). The Stottesden jurors said81 the same in substance, but separately reported Sir Henry de Wyngeham's share of Erdinton as worth sixteen merks (\u00a310. 13s. 4d.)

The Treasurer and Barons being present, the tenant wras to attempt to sever the rod with one of the knives, which (apparently to prove the soundness of the rod) was to bend or break. The other knife was to do the same work at one stroke, and then be given up to the King's Chamberlain for royal use. The only intelligible object of this service was, of course, that the King should be annually supplied with a knife of uncommon temper. We may conjecture endlessly and vainly as to how he came to look to his tenant of the secluded More for such an implement. Imagi nation presents some incident of a Royal Chase in the Forest of Mors or of Shirlet \u2014 some moment of kingly peril and opportune aid \u2014 a lost or broken couteaux de chasse replaced by the trusty blade of some watchful and well-rewarded follower.

It merely says, that \u2014 \" Richard de (read le) Medler holds one virgate of land, and renders for the same annually, at the feast of Saint Nicholas (read Michael), two knives (knipulos).\" A second contemporary Roll2 supplies the place of payment, viz., the Exchequer ; a third3 writes the name Richard le Mener. In 1245 Nicholas de More is said4 to pay at the Exchequer two knives (cultellos), one good, the other very bad, for certain land which he holds of the King in capite in More. In 1255, the Stottesden Jurors report,5 that \" Nicholas le Medler holds one virgate in More in capite of the Lord King, rendering at the Exchequer two knives, one of which ought to cut a hazel rod (et alium splicantem in caseo frisco6), and he does no other service for the said land.\" In Nov. 1274, Jurors of the same Hundred say7 at length, that \" Nicholas de la More holds one virgate in that vill of the Lord 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. 2 Ibidem, p. 417. 5 Rot.

However, the name of Boscobel belongs, I ima gine, to a much more recent nomenclature, aud the subsequent status of both Boscobel, Boningale, Bold, and Colebatch, excepts each of them from all probability of having been, like Bolebec, a demesne Manor of Earl Roger. This is not the case with Bolas ; whose condition in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was exactly that which we should have expected to result from such a Domesday status as that of Bolebec. But the last syllables of the two names have no etymological affinity, and Bolas is in the area of thc Domes day Hundred of Recordine, through which the survey2 of Earl Roger's demesnes had already passed before it arrived at Earding ton. Lastly, Bolas was a much larger Manor than would consist with the type of Bolebec. We have therefore to look elsewhere than to mere surmises for a probable solution of this difficulty. As regards position in Domesday Book, Bolebec follows Earding ton (a manor of Alnodestreu Hundred), and precedes Ovre (a manor of Conedovre Hundred) ; but the mention of Ovre in this place is both redundant and imperfect, for it is noticed more fully elsewhere,3 and shown not to have been of the Earl's demesne. Its insertion here is therefore a mistake, and Bolebec becomes the last Manor of demesne ; also, Eardington (which precedes it) remains the only guide to its proximate situation. As regards etymology, \u2014 a Domesday manor, written Bolebec, would ordinarUy become Boiebatch, \u2014 as the Domesday Huelbec and Polrebec have become Pulverbatch and Welbatch ; but though many places in Shropshire have the final syllable required,4 we look in vain for any Boiebatch. It is now time to state that Bolebec is in every letter a purely Norman name. The pays de Caux had a town, a river, and a family so called. It is reasonable therefore to suppose that the name was affixed to some Shropshire locality by the Normans, which locality afterwards recovered its previous appellation.5 2 The Domesdag demesnes of the Earl were of two classes ; first, those which King Edward had held, which are enu merated consecutively ; secondly, those which the Mercian Earls or others had held, and which seem to be enumerated with some reference to position : at all events, no two consecutive Manors were so distant from each other as Bolas and Eardington. It is further believed that the silence of Domesdag as to Bolas is to be accounted for rather than questioned ; but of that hereafter. * Domesdag, so. 259 b. 4 There was a Wallsbateh near Eard- ington, but it never was a separate Manor ; also a Picklebatch, similarly insignificant. 5 Though Celt, Roman, Dane and Saxon"], [180, "130 BOLEBEC. t Further, we must look for the representative of Bolebec in some Manor afterwards retained in demesne by, or held in capite of the Crown. Such is the analogy observable in the Norman Earl's demesnes. The name of the Saxon holder, Stenulf, will not give any addi tional clue, for it occurs nowhere else in the Shropshire Domesday. Finally, the extent and condition of the Manor in 1086 was \u2014 half a hide of unvalued waste land. Summarily, then, we must look for Bolebec in some half- hide of waste land, not far from Eardington, not retaining the name of Bolebec, yet not mentioned under any other name in Domesday \u2014 and after the Norman Earl's forfeiture held by, or immediately of, the Crown. All these conditions, except that of extent, will be fulfilled in the Moor, as above described. It is however always estimated at 1 virgate (i.e. \\ hide), an ob jection certainly to its comparison with Bolebec, but one which has a parallel in many undoubted cases of identity. Again, the Moor was never involved in Eardington ; for, if it had been, it would have passed under Earl Roger's grant to Quatford Church. Not being involved, it must be presumed to have had some distinct Domesday type ? If Bolebec were not that type, what was ? Finally, when we see the waste state of the Domesday Manor perpetuated in the very name of Moor, and when we hear that the latest performers of that serjeantry (by which Moor was once held) were summoned by the Exchequer Crier, as \"Tenants of a piece of waste ground called the Moors,\" to come forward to do their annual service in Court ; 6 \u2014 if, after all this, we cannot accept the identity as proved, we need not at all events reject it tUl some more probable theory be advanced. have left reminiscences of themselves in the local nomenclature of most districts of England, so much can hardly be said of the Normans. In old Shropshire they gave a name to Montgomery before Domes dag, and to Caus after Domesdag; both which names remain. Similarly (as I sup pose) they gave a name (Bolebec) to the Moor, and a name (Dinan) to Ludlow. One of these also was earlier, the other later than Domesdag; and both have vanished. I do not at present remember any other instance of a Norman name having attached to a Shropshire locality. Dinan, I ought to add, belongs rather to Britanny than Normandy ; but the diffi culty of permanently fixing a foreign name on an Anglo-Saxon locahty is established nevertheless. 6 See Dukes' Antiquities, Appendix, p. xxvi. I must add an excuse for dwelling at such length on a trivial though per haps curious question. Domesdag is the text-book with which I set out, and thc principles of investigation advanced under Bolebec must often recur in the sequel."], [181, "131 (^Itiimrp. We have already ascertained that Ethel fleda, Queen of the Mer cians, built in the year 913 a fortress on the western side of the Severn, in a place which Florence of Worcester marks as being in his time caUed Brycge. The passage of the Saxon Chronicle which relates to the same event will, so far as the use of the word Bpicje goes, have been interpolated two centuries later than the event described. Its authority must therefore, as in a former instance, give way to that of Florence, who lived when the name of Bridge, or Brug, was first applicable to the locality of which he spoke, Uved too on the same river, and within a distance of thirty miles from the spot. Was then the site of Ethelfleda's fortress precisely that which was afterwards occupied by Earl Robert de Belesme ? Florence, whom we have thus far upheld as the best authority, says so in the most distinct terms.1 Perhaps, however, it will be no great incon sistency if we venture to vary from Florence's statement to the extent of about 200 yards in the direction of Oldbury. It is to be observed, that the name Oldbury is nothing else than old borough, and that, in Ethelfleda's other foundations, a Borough was usuaUy associated with a castle. Such were Bramsbury, Tamworth, Stafford, Eddesbury, Warwick, Chirbury, and Weard bury, whose names alone, where their locahty is doubtful, are sufficient to prove the theory.

Tradition has ascribed the whole creation to the parliamentary forces, who, after burning the town in Easter week, a.d. 1646, were occupied about another month in reducing the Castle. But the creation and use of this earthwork are two things which, however distinct in themselves, may easUy have been confused by tradition. The spot stiU retains the name of ' the Old Castle,' and doubtless assumed its conical form ages before cannon were invented or Parliaments heard of.2 A deed3 dated at Brug, in the year 1299, describes an acre of land in the fields of Oldbury, as bounded on one side by the lands of John de Oldbury; on another by the road which leads to Oldbury \" under the Old Castle,\" and on a third by \" the King's highway,4 opposite the meadow of WUliam Selymon, of Brug.\" The locality is unmistakeable, as well as the fact, that iu time of Edward I, the road from Bridgnorth to Oldbury went under what was then called the Old Castle. Now Bridgnorth Castle was the existent and gar risoned castle of that period; therefore, \"the Old Castle\" must have been a term describing something more ancient than Bridg north Castle. Having now established in direction of Oldbury a Castle and a Borough, each respectively older than the Castle and Borough of Bridgnorth, we need not ask who founded them, or discuss the matter further. Oldbury and its conical hiU are reminiscences, verbal and ma terial, of the Borough and Castle projected by Ethelfieda, Queen of Mercia, in a.d. 913. This foundation will, however, have proved abortive, for in time of King Edward the Confessor (1043-1066), \u00c6lward, a Saxon, to whom perhaps it had been granted in the intervening century, was seized of Oldbury, as well as of the neighbouring manors of Eudon (now Eudon Burnell) and Glazeley. It was probably the failure of Ethelfleda's design, rather than 2 There is little doubt that the Castle was cannonaded, and from this spot, than which none could be more eligible for such a purpose, even if the artificial elevation had been absent.

(annual value), and a wood which will fatten 100 swine. In time of King Edward it was worth 30s.; now it is worth 13s. He (Rainald) found it waste. Of Radulf, the under-tenant, little more can be said, than that he also held Fulwardine, in this Hundred, of the same Rainald Vicecomes and Petton, in Baschurch Hundred, of Robert Pincerna. Finding each of these manors afterwards possessed by a family which took its name and origin from the Norman Cotentin,6 we may conclude that Radulf was their ancestor. They subsequently acquired the Manor of Eaton, in Recordiue Hundred, and left with it a memorial of their tenure, in the yet existing name of Eaton Constantine. Nor was the change of Radulf's Domesday fief solely in the way of acquisition. His successor, perhaps his son, Hugh de Constan tine, made a grant in Petton to Shrewsbury Abbey before 1121, but no further trace remains of their ancient interest in that manor. Reserving all general account of this family till we reach Eaton Constantine, we will here notice only their connexion with Oldbury. In 1165, Helyas de Costetin held of Fitz Alan's Barony, by service of one knight's fee, and two muntatores.7 Half a fee, equal to one muntator, will have been the contingent of Oldbury and Fulwardine towards their service 5 Isdem Rainaldus tenet Aldeberie et Radulfus de eo.

Oldbury was originally in the Parish of the Church of Morville, and will have continued without any separate place of worship till, in the beginning of Stephen's reign (c. 1138), Helyas de Con stantine founded a Chapel, with a Cemetery, here, endowing it with half a virgate (about 30 acres) of land and a mansion.20 This Chapel seems to have been consecrated by Bishop Robert de Betun with reference to the troubled state of the country. A pension, in token of subjection to the Mother Church, was secured by a further deed21 of that Prelate, and remained for at least two centuries a receipt of Shrewsbury Abbey. Its amount was 5s. annually. About a. d. 1200-1210, Thomas de Costentin grants to God and to St. Nicholas, and to the Chapel of Aldebury, half a virgate in 16 Pedes finium, 47 Hen. Ill, Salop.

If taken to indicate size or importance, these are attributes which no memory or record3 can connect with Ful wardine. The Saxon pul (i. e. foul) is, however, a term which may have been applied to any locality where the soil was of a tenacious quality, and is probably the other constituent of this name. Edmund, the Saxon Lord of Fulwardine, also held Ulton (now Upton Cressett) in this Hundred. In 1086, Fulwardine was, like Oldbury, held by Radulf, under Rainald the sheriff; and, like Oldbury, it descended as a tenure of de Constantine, under Fitz Alan.

Its tenure was also now, and long afterwards, quite distinct from Fulwardine. The Record quoted has therefore confused6 the two manors, and it is probable that Fulwardine was held by Matilda de Fulwardine alone, under Adam de Montgomery, and by less than one-fourth of a knight's fee. It is, however, singular that a mere error should in some sort anticipate the modern combination. Wtytim \u00a3xmttt ULTONE, UPTON WARIN. UPTON SUPER EDGE. The identity of Upton Cressett with the Domesday Ultone is not so obvious as to be assumed without explanation. The first question is, whether the printed Domesday is, in every letter, a faithful copy of the original ? This being answered affirmatively, 4 Rot. Hund., vol. ii. p. 82. This Roger de Constantine was reported as a defaulter at the Assizes of January, 1256. (Salop Assize Roll, Placita Coron\u0153, memb. 2 dorso.) 6 Iu the time of Richard II (1397), Oldbury and Fulwardyn remained one tenure. John de Oldbury held both by half a fee, under the Earl of Arundel. (Calend. Eschet., vol. iii, p. 223.) Kirby's Quest. Stottesden Hundred."], [189, "UPTON CRESSETT. 139 the next question is, whether Upton be a corruption of the original name Ultone, or whether the Domesday scribe mistook the ortho graphy in the first instance, and wrote Ultone when Uptone was pronounced ? The first of these is most probable, if it be quite clear that the situation of Upton Cressets, when compared with other Uptons and with the surrounding district, is not sufficiently elevated to account for the name.1 In Domesday, Ultone is put down as containing 3 hides ; but in 1255 Upton is rated at 3^ hides. Now this variation is in general an argument against any assumed identity ; but, in the present in stance, it will rather tell the other way; for most of the neigh bouring manors changed their Domesday hidage {e.g. Meadowley, Chetton, Faintree, Glazeley, Oldbury, and Eudon Burnell), and Criddon (the next manor to Upton) had no Domesday type at all. Nor can we altogether balance these discrepancies, by supposing that what was lost to one manor was gained by another, for the figures will bear out no such assumption. It is clear then that the boundaries and contents of the manors in this quarter were not finally established at Domesday ; or, if they were, that the Jurors or the Commissioners made or recorded statements with the same inaccuracy as that which has been noticed under Morville. As regards the identity of Ultone and Upton, the negative proof must, therefore, suffice after all. If Rainald's Domesday Manor of Ultone, in Alnodestreu Hundred, does not correspond with Fitz Alan's Manor of Upton, in Stottesden Hundred, what nearer coun terpart can be found for either ? In 1086, the status of the Manor is thus described.2 \" The same Rainald (the Sheriff) holds Ultone. Edmund held it, and was a free-man. Here are 3 hides geldable. In demesne are 2 ox teams ; and (there are) 3 serfs, 1 free neat-herd, 6 villains, 4 boors, and 1 radman, with 4 ox-teams, and yet there might be 4 other (such teams) . Here is a wood which will fatten 30 swine. In time of King Edward it was worth 40s., and afterwards worth 10s. Now it is worth 25s.\" Bishop Robert de Betun, amongst tithes in his diocese which had been granted to Salop Abbey (apparently before 1138), con- tainly remarks on the incongruity between the name and situation. 1 I have no recollection of Mr. Blake way's notice of Upton (Cresset.) as re gards its Domesday state ; but he cer- 2 Domesday, so. 255 a. 2."], [190, "140 UPTON CRESSETT. firms two-thirds of the tithes of the Lord (or Lordship) of Upton.3 1 know of no other Upton in Hereford Diocese in which such a grant can have been made, neither can I trace any subsequent evidence of it here. Yet Alan de Opton, the contemporary Lord of this place, appears to have been interested in religious grants which concerned Salop Abbey, and he attests Robert Fitz Aer's endowment of the Chapel of Aston Aer at this very period.4 In 1165, the same or another Alan de Upton is recorded as holding under thc Barony of Fitz Alan, by service of one muntator} Undoubtedly the tenure was here. In 1180, William Goiun (whom I take to be a succeeding Lord of Upton, called by his family name) was fined 3 merks by the Justices of the Forest for waste in Upeton;6 and the same William Goon stands second witness to a very ancient and nearly coeval charter which relates to land in Corve (near Monk Hopton), and of which Robert Fitz Aer is first witness.7 His successor seems to have been that Hugh de Hupton who first appears in November, 1194, as Recognizor in an assize which concerned land in this quarter.8 At Salop Assizes, October 1203, he sat as a Juror in several causes, and was himself .subject to an amercement of half a merk.9 10th May, 1220, he is named visor of timber, to he taken from the King's forests, for repairs of Bridgnorth Castle.10 In 1225, he occurs as having been Agistator of the King's forests.11 In August, 1226, he sat on a great Inquest about Stiperstones Forest;12 again, in 1229, he appears as Agistator of the Royal Forests,13 and in October, 1237, as a Juror in a great trial about Shawbury, taken before the King at Worcester.14 In or about 1240, he is returned as holding half a fee in Opton, or Hupton, of Fitz Alan's Barony.15 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 334. 12 Plac. coram Rege, 10 Hen.

The evidence regarding this family is sufficiently clear to warrant the insertion of a genealogical table of their descent ; but previous to doing so it may be proper to give abstracts of certain charters quoted from the Cressets evi dences, by Mr. Blakeway, in his MSS. in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.31 A deed of John, Lord of Upton (1283-1300), mentions Isabella, his wife, and John, his son, and is attested by Ralph de Arraz, Walter de Beysin, Richard Rector of Nenton, and Wydo de Glasele. A deed, dated 18 Edw. Ill (1344-5), shows John, Lord of Upton, enfeoffii-g Guy, his son, and Margaret, wife of Guy, in lands lately held by John, son of the grantor. In 36 Edw. Ill (1362-3), Guy, Lord of Upton and Stapeley, grants to Nicholas, his brother, Stapeley ; which he, Guy, had by gift of John, their father. In 40 Edw. Ill (1366-7), the same Guy grants to Sir John, Rector of Upton (in trust, I presume), the Manor and Advowson of Upton, and lands which Johanna, his mother, and Nicholas, his brother, held for their lives in Upton and Stapeleye. In 46 Edw. Ill (1372-3), John atte Broke, Parson of Upton, releases the same to Hugh de Upton. In 6 Ric.

In 5 Edw. II (1311-12), Adam, son of William, Lord of Upton, grants to John, Lord of Upton, his nephew, a tenement in Criddon, which he (Adam) bought of Richard, son of Reginald Elyes, of Criddon. The grant is for the lives of Johanna the wife, and Guy the son, of the grantee. The following genealogy of the first Lords or Upton, till the extinction of their male line, is inserted not with any idea of its completeness, but as containing only such particulars as have been collected from first-rate authorities. The Pedigrees given in He ralds' Visitations are usually much more diffuse. My object, in these cases, is to supply a statement independent of the Visitations, and in agreement with them or not, as the case may be. If found at variance with them, I leave such points to antiquaries who make genealogy a more exclusive study than would suit either the limits or the nature of a work like the present.

In November, 1221, Edith, widow of Herbert Pistor, sued William le Harpur (her step-son) for one-third of a hide in Upton, as her dower. William proved that Herbert, his father, obtained the land with a former wife, Dionisia, William's mother, so that a second wife could have no claim of dower therein.34 At the same time, Adam le Breton had a suit against William le Harpur, which he failed to prosecute. So he and his pledges (Hugh de Upton and Robert de Faintre) were amerced.35 The deed by which William Citharista (i.e. le Harper) enfeoffed Ralph Pistor here has been already set forth.36 It must have passed about this time, for William Fitz Aer, the first witness, suc ceeded after 1221, and Anketill, Clerk of Brug, the second witness, has been already mentioned as attesting earlier in the century.37 Moreover, in August, 1226, William le Harpur was found to have disseized Ralph Pistor of 1| acres in Upton (doubtless part of his previous grant), and had to pay 2s. damages.38 In December, 1250, Herbert Fitz Robert (le Bretun) had sued Alan le Harpur for novel disseisin in Upton,39 and the cause being decided, a new writ was granted in 1252, whereby 24 knights were to retry it,40 and convict the former Jurors (if their verdict proved false). Master Simon de Wanton was Justiciar in each case. At Salop Assizes, January, 1256, it was decided, that Alan le Harpur had not disseized said Herbert of half a virgate in Upton, for that Herbert was a villain, as had previously been proved before Master Simon de Wanton. Alan was quit, and Herbert not amerced because of poverty.41 8 Nov. 1356, Giles de Erdinton was ordered to try this cause, \u2014 but the order is cancelled on the Roll,42 obviously because the officials in London had entered it without adverting to its previous settlement in the country.

It is most probable that Upton was part of the great Saxon Parish of Morville. No Church was built here at Domesday, and the founder of one at any subsequent period must have entered into some com position with Shrewsbury Abbey on the subject. We have pointed out46 a right of tithes, in some Upton, of Hereford Diocese, as belonging to Salop Abbey early in Stephen's reign ; and, though the right does not subsequently appear, nothing is more possible than that it was in this Upton, and that it was surrendered on the foundation of the Parish Church, of course for some ample consideration. Passing the period when we have analogy only for a guide, we know that in January, 1259, an Assize of darrein presentment to Upton Church had then to he tried between William de Upton (then Lord of this Upton) and Richard Foliot,47 whom I identify with a contemporary Rector of Chetton. In 1291, the Church of Upton, in the Deanery of Stottesden, was taxed (valued) at \u00a3Z. 6s. 8c.. It was in the first instance assessed to the tenth (6s. 8d .) , though under \u00a34. annual value.48 A note however states, that it was not elsewhere endowed, and in the end it appears to have been exempted.49 In 1341, the Church of Upton- super -Egge (Edge), in Stottesden Deanery, is entered as one whose taxation was 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. Sd.). The assessors of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, in the Parish, accounted only for 17s. The difference arose because there were only two fleeces of wool in the Parish, and no lambs ; and \" be cause the vill of Meduleye used to be taxed with Upton, and is 43 Plac. apud Qloucest. 53 Hen.

Ill (1372-3) ARCHITECTURAL REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL CHURCH. The Church of Upton Cressets, as originally built, might belong to any part of the twelfth century. It consists of a nave and chancel, separated by a rich round-headed arch of four orders, ornamented on the western face, principally with the Chevron. The font is shaped like a jar, and ornamented with round headed arches. The east-window of the chancel is pointed. If this was its original shape, the date of the building will be thrown into a late part of the twelfth century. The side-windows are round-headed. A south aisle, of a late period, has been attached to the chancel. J. L. Petit. 51 Valor. Eccles., iii, 211. 50 Inquis. Nonarum, 191. Though the tithes of Meadowley belonged in 1291 to Upton Church, and so contributed to its taxation or value, Meadowley itself was not detached from the Parish of Morville. So I interpret this passage. There must have been more than one transaction be tween the lay Lord of Upton and Mea dowley and Salop Abbey, but I have met with no record of any, except one which will be given under Meadowley, and which is not pertinent to the present question. \u2122 Plaketvay MSS., in Bibl. Bodl. This is the only instance in which the place has occurred to me as Upton Warin. If Mr. Blakeway be right in assigning the fu-Bt entry above to this Upton, it can only have acquired the name of Warin from Warin the Sheriff, its possessor before Domesday, or else from some feoffee, probably as early as Henry the First's time."], [204, "148 jHcatifltolep, Dugdale's and the usual dictum, as to the termination ley, viz. that it must either be referred to the British lie (locus, a place), or to the Saxon ley (unfilled ground), has been already recognised in two instances.1 This theory is however found to be much too indefinite to remain content with. The prevalence of the termination, its greater frequency in East Shropshire than in the West of the County, or even in Wales and Cornwall, and its being oftener associated with Saxon than British words, are reasons which make the Saxon termination most pro bable in cases which will at present occur to us. The only exception must be where the syllable is combined with another word obviously British. But there is a great doubt whether the Saxon compound itself be always one and the same. If ley means \" unfilled ground,\" its entry into such names as Meadowley, Comley, Oatley, Cloverley, and Ploughley, involves a simple contradiction. If it means \" a plain,\" we yet find it in various names where it is anything hut apposite. The truth seems to be, that there are two Saxon words which both enter into composition, and, being derived from a common root, have been confused. The first, leaj, is far the most common. It is Latinized lega, enters into Leighton, and is the termination of a host of names which our ancestors wrote with the final leg, rather than ley, Meadowley being one of the number. It is a doubt whether this Saxon word involved any idea as to tillage, or the nature of the surface in localities to which it attached. The word in its primary sense signified law, its secondary meaning was a district marked out by law or custom. Thus in Saxon usage it was nearly equiva lent to our word \" Manor.\" Another Saxon word l\u00e6j-e, l\u00e6ru or l\u00e6j-pe (a pasture or common), originated such a local name as Layston, in contrast to Leighton, and probably had the same root as our terms lea, ley, leys, and 1 Vide supra, under Billingsley and Taslcy."], [205, "149 MEADOWLEY. leazow; and this root (the germ both of leaj, law, and l\u00e6j-e, pasture) conveyed a common idea (viz. something fixed or laid down) to each derivative. The meaning then of M\u00e6bepe-leaj is \" the district of meadows,\" a much more intelligible idea than that of \"unfilled meadow ground,\" with which the old rules of investigation would have sup plied us. In Domesday the place is thus noticed.2 \u2014 Helgot holds (of Earl Roger) Madolea. Austin held it. Here is half a hide geldable. He (Austin) was a free man. Richard holds it of Helgot. There is (arable) land (enough) for vi ox-teams. In demesne is i team, and (there are) iii serfs and i radman, with half a team, and (there are) ii boors. In time of King Edward it was worth 30s. Now it is worth 11s. When (Helgot) received it it was worth 2s. The name of Augustine or Austin naturally became common among the Christianized Anglo-Saxons. It was borne by more than one Shropshire landowner in the Confessor's time. Of Helgot, the Norman Lord of Meadowley as of other Manors, we shall have often to speak. He was one of Earl Roger's Barons, and founder of the Castle which still bears his name. Of Richard, his Domesday tenant at Meadowley, nothing positive can be stated, but there are circumstances in the subsequent his tory of the place which make it not improbable that he was no other than Richard de Belmeis. This person was certainly in Shropshire about the time of Domesday, and attested the Earl Roger's charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, which must have followed that Record very shortly, and which bespeaks some importance of position for each witness.3 He afterwards became Viceroy of the County, and Bishop of London. His temporal and ecclesiastical possessions in Shropshire were at his death considerable. Meadowley may have been the germ of the former, and it cer tainly went in a succession analogous to the lay fiefs of Richard de Belmeis. Of him and his representatives we shall have much to say elsewhere. The next notice after Domesday which we can associate with Meadowley belongs to the year 1165, when Ranulf de Belmeis 2 Domesday, so. 258, b, 1. 3 He also attests a deed of the Earl's I already recited (Vide supra, p. Ill) and | proved to have passed in or about 1086."], [206, "150 MEADOWLEY. appears as holding one fee of old feoffment under Herbert de Castello.4 These two we know to have been the then repre sentatives of Richard de Belmeis and Helgot, before mentioned. In 1180, among fines imposed, by Justices of the Forest, on resi dents in this neighbourhood, Richard de Beaumes, a cadet of the family, and probably interested in Meadowley, was amerced 2s. for waste? But a subinfeudation of this Manor must have taken place at an early period, whereby the Lords of the neighbouring Upton will have acquired the substantive interest here. The mesne tenure of de Belmeis consequently receives little notice. Hence we find that Hugh, Lord of Upton, early in the thirteenth century, granted to Morville Church a parcel of land in his vill of Medeweleg, to hold for ever, at a rent of 12c.. \u2014 Witnesses: Hugh de Kinsedeleg, Richard then Chaplain of Marnerfeld, Andrew de Northleg.6 Hence also, in 1240, when Thomas Manduit held the Barony of Castle Holgate, Hugh de Opton or Upton is said to hold one fee thereof in \"Medewelee or Medeweleg,7 the mesne tenure of Belmeis being ignored. In 1255, however, Thomas de Upton is returned, by the Stottesden jurors, as holding vi. virgates of land under Roger de Beumes in Medwele. \" And he did suit twice a year to the Court of William Manduit, at the Castle of Holegod, and he owed ward at that Castle in time of war for forty days, for the fee of one knight.\"8 In 1284, when the Barony of Castle Holgate was in the family of Burnel, John de Hopton (.. e. Upton) is entered as holding Medeueleye of Robert Burnel by one knight's fee.9 Philip Burnel died in 1294, and amongst his Lordships which then passed to the Crown, during a minority of the heir, was Medewelley.10 By reason of this temporary seizin of the Crown, and the corresponding death of the sub-tenant in 1301, the Escheator was ordered to take into 4 Lib.

Meduleye and Upton are the two Manors enumerated; and mention is also made of the suit of Court which the deceased had owed to Castle Holgate.12 This John de Upton (as has been stated under Upton Cressets) also left a son under age, so that the Manor of Meadowley was in the King's hands for several years, except a third thereof, which the widow of the deceased Tenant had in dower. An escheator's account, which has occurred in a fragmentary Roll in custody of the Queen's Remembrancer, acknowledges 20s. to have been re ceived \" from two parts of the land which was John de Upton's in Maddeleye, and which was in manu Regis by reason of the minority of John, son and heir of John, who holds of the heir of Philip Burnel,\" &c.

It must, however, be still out of place, for no vill corresponding to Cerlecote can he traced in the area of the old Hundred of Recordin. By removing the affix two lines lower still, we have it in con nexion with the Manor of Ofitone (Uffington), where its applica bflity can admit of no doubt. After thus restoring an erroneous affix to its proper place in the margin, the Domesday notice of Cerlecote, as following Meadowley, will remain under Alnodestreu Hundred, There we find a place too (Charlcott) exactly reflecting the older name. Bold is not mentioned singly in Domesday. It was in fact in volved in Cerlecote ; hut, at a later period, Bold became the caput of the combined Manor, and Charlcott the member. Domesday notices the whole thus : \u2014 ~ The same Helgot holds Cerlecote (of the Earl), Elsi held it (in time of King Edward) and was free. Here is half a hide, geldable. There is (arable) land (sufficient) for 2 ox-teams. It is and was waste. It used to be worth 10s. (in time of King Edward.) A Saxon Alsi (with the name written Elsi or \u00c6lsi) was Lord of Corston and Middlehope, in the adjoining Domesday Hundred of Culvestan ; and whereas no such name appears in the Hundred of Recordin, we have herein a circumstance which increases the pro bability of our having rightly placed Cerlecote in Alnodestreu Hun dred. We will not yet speak of Helgot or his descendants otherwise than when they may occur as the seignoral Lords of Bold and Charlcott. They seem to have granted a feoffment of this Manor at least as early as the time of Henry I, and their tenants thenceforth to have taken the local name. The earliest tenant occurring in this position was probably that Odo de la Boude who stands the third of four witnesses to the deed whereby Herebert, son of Holegod, Lord of the Castle, enfeoffed Herlewyn de Butailles in Dudmaston and Posthorne.3 2 Domesday, so. 258, b. 1. The three periods of Domesday valuation are very observable in this entry, the time when the Manor was waste, being that at which it came to Helgot's hands. There are many reasons for assigning it to a date anterior to the death of Henry I (1135). There are also objections to so early a date. Both shall be stated and the charter given in its proper place. It certainly passed in the twelfth cen tury. 3 This charter is in possession of W. W. Whitmore, Esq., of Dudmaston."], [209, "CHARLCOTT AND BOLD. 153 The feodary of 1165 gives R. de Holda as holding, by service of one knight, under Herebert de Castello. This fee was of old feoff ment, and the name of the feoffee should be written R. de Bolda.4 About the year 1190 died one Robert de Girrhos, a person appa rently of much consideration in Sliropshire during the reigns of Stephen and Henry II. He was not only a tenant in capite of the Crown, hut held under the two Baronies of Clun and Castle Holgate. His successor, another Robert de Girrhos, had not livery till some years after Ids death. In the interval the King's Escheator, or the Sheriff, accounts to the Exchequer for the profits of his lands. Most of them were held under Castle Holgate, which also was at the time in the King's hand. An Escheator's roll for the year 1195 is preserved, and contains that officer's receipt (inter alia) of 8s. of the ferm of Cherlecote, which was Robert de Girros', for a whole year, viz., from March 1194 to March 1195. 5 In the octaves of St. Michael, 1200, in the King's Court at Westminster, a suit, wherein Herbert de la Bude was plaintiff against Alan de Mara, his brother, and Robert de Giros, was post poned till the octaves of St. Martin (Nov. 18), by writ of Geoffry Fitz-Piers6 (then Chief Justice of England). On the day of adjournment (Nov. 18), the Justices of the King's Bench have the King's mandate to adjourn the hearing of this cause, which concerned four carrucates of land in Boude, till the octaves of St. Andrew (Dec. 7) ; then to come before the King himself wherever he may be in England. And the Justices are to send this writ and the former writ (that of Geoffry Fitz-Piers) and a record of the plea.7 On the day given (Dec. 7, 1200) King John was at Clarendon. Then and there, or shortly after, and elsewhere, he doubtless heard the pleadings which follow. \"Herbert de Bouda sues for three hides in Bouda against Robert de Girros and Alan de Mara as his seizin and inheritance, which he (Herbert) entrusted to the custody of Alan ; and the said Alan, for the sake of staving off and taking away the right of Herbert, committed them to Robert de Girros ; and that such is the case, and that he (Herbert) was seized thereof as of fee, by taking esplees thereof, &c., he offers to prove by Adam de Kerleton, or hy Henry de Witeleg.

And Herbert petitions that it may be reckoned in his favour how the other had entered upon his reply without those charters (cartillis). And Robert de Girros was present and contradicted Herbert in no particular. A day was given to the parties in the octaves of Hilary (Jan. 20, 1201) to hear sentence before the Lord King, wherever he may be in England. \"IJ On Jan. 20, 1201, the King was at Louth (Lincolnshire), and it was probably about that time that \" Herbert de Bouda offered himself on the fourth day (after the day given) against Alan de la Mara and Robert de Giros, in a plea about three hides in Bouda.10 The defendants came not nor essoigned themselves, and yet the day was given them in banco.

The preli minaries were rehearsed, and the defendants not appearing it was ordered by the Court that Herbert should have seizin of the land for default of the defendants.11 At Shrewsbury Assizes, Oct. 1203, Herbert le Boude presented himself in due course against Richard Bretone in a suit concerning one virgate in la Boude. The defendant not appearing, the land was seized into the King's hand, and he (the defendant) summoned to appear at Worcester before the same Justices on a future day.13 Early apparently in the thirteenth century Robert de Bolda gave and confirmed to Alan de la Mare his father's brother spatruo suo) for his homage and service and for 6d. rent, one virgate in Bold, half of which was held by Haer and half by Geoffry Ribel, with a messuage, croft, &c. \u2014 Witnesses : Thomas Mauduit (then Lord of Castle Helgot) and Robert his brother.13 8 A word is defaced here, probably equivalent to \"cartillas\" below.

The same Constable had also fined the vill of Bold 40s. because it disregarded a sum mons of his, which by right and custom it was not bound to regard.\u2014 In 1284, Adam de Bolda is returned as holding Bold, by one knight's fee, of Robert Burnell, of the fee of Castle Holegod.23 At the Assizes of Sept. 1292, Adam de Bolde is returned as holding a knight's fee, being of age, and yet not a knight.24 He occurs as a Juror 15 March, 1301 ;25 and in 1306 Adam del Bolde was Manucaptor for Richard de Harley, Knight of the Shire ;26 and in March, 1316, Malcolumb, son of the said Richard, is returned as Lord of Bolde.27 Some further notices of events and persons connected with this Manor shall be given in order of time. \u2014 About 1210, a Charter of Thomas Mauduit to Salop Abbey is attested by Robert Mauduit, Robert de Girros, and Walter de Mara.28 In August, 1226, a trial came before the King at Salop, as to whether Warin junior (juvenis) de la Bolde had disseized Eva, widow of Richard de Den, of her free tenement in Den.

She is judged to he in misericordia for false claim.29 At Salop Assizes, January, 1256, Katherine, widow of Roger de Cherlescote, sued William de Cherlescote and several others for thirds of small tenements in Cherlescote and Bolde.30 They how ever accorded their differences; and a fine passed Feb. 3, 1256, whereby William de Cherlcote, Roger de la Bolde, Henry de Suthury (Sidbury), William le Chapelayn, John le Petit, Hugh de Hereford, Brice de Cleybury, and John de Dreyton, tenants, con ceded thirds to said Katherine, in divers small parcels in Bold and Cherlecote for life.31 At the same Assizes, Roger, son of Roger de Weston, appeared against Roger le Mouner, of Clebyri, in a suit to oblige him to keep to his agreement about a moiety of Cherlecot Mill. The defendant appeared not, and having made previous defaults, the Sheriff was ordered to distrain, &c. till he appear.32 It appears that the King of Almain, during his seizin of the Barony of Castle Holgate, withdrew from the Hundred of Stot tesden the suit of the vill of Bolde, and the suit of WUliam Fitz Alan de Cherlecote, and of his under-tenants in Cherlecote, and appropriated the said suits to his own liberty of Castle Helgot.33 The said King of Almain demised, about a.d. 1263, his interest in this Barony to the Templars, who, in November 1274, still with held the same suits from Stottesden Hundred. It also appears that Roger de Mortimer, of Wigmore, after the siege of Kenilworth (1266), amongst other encroachments on the rights of the Crown, withdrew from Stottesden Hundred the suit of William de Pdardinton and his under-tenants in the vill of Cherlecote. William de Cherlecote occurs as a Juror, 2 Dec. 1259,34 as Regarder of the King's Forests, Feb. 1262,35 and as Juror36 on a Forest Inquest, March 13, 1262.

The earliest notice of a Church or Chapel here belongs to the year 127L-72, when Adam de la Bold refused to present an extor tionate Under-Sheriff, John Baril, to the same.41 In 1291 the Church of Bolde, in Stottesden Deanery, was valued at i_4. 6s. 8c?. The Co-rectors of Castle Holgate seem also to have had three portions or pensions in this Church. The names of the then Portionists were Richard de Eyton, Matthew, and Robert, and their pensions, 3s. 6c.., 3s. 3d., and 3s. 3c.., respectively.42 The total valuation, thus made up, is repeated in the Inquisitions of 1341, where the taxation of Bolde Chapel is put at \u00a34. 16s. 8c.. But the assessors and vendors of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, in the Parish, valued such produce only at .\u00a32. 6s. 8c?. ; so much less than the taxation, because 2 virgates lie unfilled in the parish, and the tenants have quitted through poverty; and because there are no sheep there ; and because the small tithes, offerings, and glebe, and other profits of the Church, go to make up the taxation ** (and are not to be reckoned in the ninth). 38 Pedes finium, 53 Hen.

The last syllable, tre, so common in Wales and Cornwall, signifies a village or hamlet. As to Fain, Faven, or Favon, I suppose it to be the British Ffa'e'n (a bean) , or Ffaon (beans) . The etymological association between this place and Daventrey (Northants) is observable. The Daventrei and Faventrei of Domes day have become respectively Daintree and Faintree; the former being, however, only changed in pronunciation, while the latter is also written in the contracted form. With regard to the Domesday state of Faintree, it is not easily deducible from the printed edition of that Record, inasmuch as notices of two other Manors are mixed up with this, and thus the whole passage is left unintelligible. A glance at the original shows, however, that a later scribe, using different ink, has added a sup plement to the previous matter, and carelessly inserted the said supplement between two members of the same sentence. Thus, what is only marked as parenthetical in the original, by being written in a different nand, loses all distinctiveness whatever when printed in an uniform type and without annotation. Reuniting the clauses which treat of Faintree in Domesday we learn as follows : \u2014 The same1 Walcheline holds Faventrei (of the Earl) .

In time of King Edward it was worth 27s., now (it is worth) 20s. He (Walcheline) found it waste.2 Walcheline's tenure here was either hy serjeantry (a matter which Domesday omits) , or became so in the time of Henry I, when tenants of the Earl became tenants in capite. At all events, a Stottesden Jury,3 two centuries after Domesday, calling a former, and probably this, tenant, \" Walcheline de Fayn tre,\" recorded his tenure to have been by the serjeantry which will presently be described. The successor of Walcheline, one century after Domesday, was Robert de Fayntre, who occurs in November, 1194, as recognizor, in a trial which concerned land at Holicott, or in the neighbour hood.4 When, at Michaelmas, 1203, the Sheriff accounted for the fourth scutage of King John's reign, Robert de Fentrepaid half a merkfor his serjeantry, the said scutage being assessed at 2 merks on each knight's fee.5 At Michaelmas, 1204, and for King John's fifth scutage (which was 2 \\ merks on each knight's fee) Robert de Fenitree had paid 20s.6 In 1211, the serjeantry of Robert de Fayent' is returned as con sisting in the service of one foot-soldier, with a bow and arrows, in the King's army in Wales.7 Iu November, 1221, Robert de Faintre was pledge of Adam le Breton, in a suit against William 'le Harper.8 The latter was of Upton, in this neighbourhood. In 1255, the tenure of this Manor was returned by the Stottes den Jurors as follows : \u2014 \" Adam de Faintre is Lord of Faintre, and holds in capite of the Lord the King, for service of one serjeant, with bow and arrows, when the King sha_l he iu North Wales.

At the Assizes of January, 1256, Adam de Feyntre sat as a Juror for the Hundred of Stottesden.10 In February, 1262, he appears as one of the Regarders of the King's forest in Shropshire.11 About 1267 he attests a grant of the Advowson of Chetton, to be hereafter noticed.12 On January 26, 1270, he sat as a Juror in the Inquisition as to the estate of Robert Corbet, of Chetton, then deceased.13 In 2 Edw. I (1274), Adam de Fayntre was himself dead, having been seized of this Manor.14 His estate became divided amongst his five daughters and coheirs. On November 27, 1274, in answer to a question as to the class of persons whose lands had been seized by the Officers of the Crown into the King's hands, the Stottesden Jurors stated, that the lands of Adam de Faintre, when he died, were so seized by Sir John de Erkalewe, then Escheator,15 and who was still in office. But the Jurors did not know for certain how long the said Escheator held them in the King's hand, but they thought for six weeks. The same jurors, in reply to a question as to the King's fees and tenants in this Hundred, answered that Richard de Holicote, Hugh le Massun, Peter Chamberlain (Camerarius) , Henry le Taylur, and Margery, daughter of Adam de Faintru, hold the Manor of Fain tru, of the Lord King in capite by serjeantry of finding one foot man, with a bow and arrows, to' go with the Lord King into Wales when he will levy war, and to stay there till he (the footman) hath shot away his arrows. A further account of this Manor must involve some notice of each of the five coheiresses among whom it was divided on the death of their father, Adam de Faintru. 1. The eldest of these, Clemence, had married Richard de Holi cote, and he, in 1274, had fined for relief of his share. Of this fine he rendered account in 1275.16 April 2, 1278.

The serjeantry at Faintre is however valued at 110s., and Richard de Holicote and Clemence his wife still retain their share, though there was some informality, which caused their land to be seized into the King's hand, and them to replevy it, by payment of a rnerk, till the next Parliament.19 In 25 Edw. I (1297), the Originalia Rolls contain a precept to the Escheator to seize into the King's hand the lands and tenements which were Clemence's, late the wife of Richard de Holicote.20 In that year too there was an Inquest as to the same Clemence and her license to alienate one messuage and half a carrucate of land in Faintre.21 In March, 1316, John de Knokyn is returned as sole Lord of Faintre,23 and an Inquest on his death in 14 Edw. II (1320-1) would seem to imply his possession of most of the Manor ; 23 but these particulars belong to a later era. 2. Henry le Taylor (alias Cissor) who married Alice, the second daughter and coheir of Adam de Faintre, fined for his relief in 1274, and appears like Richard de Holicote on the Pipe Roll of 1275. He was living in October, 1292, and holding his share of Faintre, 17 Inquisitions, 6 Ed. I, No. 90. and name, seems also to have been used in sieges, and was impelled by a machine called tribuchulus. I also think that the terpolus above was a missile, but not of so large a kind. 13 Kirby's Quest. The word terpolus or tribulus, which I translate galtrap, or caltrap, seems to have had more than one meaning. Its primary form was probably the Greek rpifioXoc., an aquatic plant, which produced a prickly nut of a tri angular shape. In its secondary sense it was the name of an implement, used in war, to impede the movements of cavalrv, and which consisted of four iron spikes, so attached to a centre as that, any three resting on the ground, the fourth pointed upwards. A missile, of the same shape 19 Placita Coron\u0153, 20 Ed. I, Salop, memb. 20 recto.

He too, on this occasion, had to pay a fine till some question as to his tenure was settled by Parliament.34 3. Peter le Chamberlain, who had married Isabel, the third daughter and coheir, appears in 1274 and 1275 as offering and paying a fine for his relief. However, the Records of Trinity Term, 15 Edw. I (1287), are quoted, as showing this same Peter then coming to the Exchequer, and fining half a rnerk for relief of his share of Faintre, which he holds by serjeantry of Ushery (hostiari\u00e6) to the King in his army.25 In 1292, Peter le Chamberlyn was dead, but Isabella his wife held 1 carrucate (except _ a virgate and 3 acres) , and the tenure was worth 46s. per annum. She was obliged to join in a fine to prevent the seizure thereof into the King's hand.26 4. Margery, the fourth daughter of Adam de Faintre, has been already mentioned, as if unmarried, in November, 1274. In 1275, however, her husband, Henry de la Porte, accounted for her relief. On March 22, 1278, William de Stapele having represented to the King, that, when he had purchased half a virgate in Fayntre of Margery, fifth daughter of Adam de Feyntre, the Sheriff of Salop (being also Escheator of the County) had ejected him, the King desires a Jury to be summoned to report the particulars. The said Jury sat on April 29th following, and returned the service due on the said land as one-fifth of a soldier in Wales, stated its annual value to be 9s. 9d., and that Margery had enfeoffed said William therein; nor did the Jurors think the said land to he an escheat of the King's, nor that his allowance of said sale would be to the King's injury.27 In 1292 two tenures are recorded in Fayntre, hut it is doubtful which of them represents the share under notice. Warin de Mid dleton holds half a virgate of the annual value of 5s. : William de Wrocwardyn and Emma his wife, hold half a virgate and 3 acres, of 6s. annual value. Both tenures had something informal in them, probably as involving a transfer unsanctioned by the Crown. Their temporary seizure was the consequence.28 5. The fifth (or fourth) daughter of Adam de Faintre was wife of Hugh de Massun (or le Mazun) in November, 1274. 26 Placita Corona, 20 Ed. I, ut supra. 27 Inquisitions, 6 Ed.

It was worth 50s. per annum. They also joined in a fine to escape temporary disseisin.30 Of under-tenancies here, one or two notices occur.\u2014 At Salop Assizes, August, 1226, Philip, son and heir of Philip, recovered against Sibil de Broc (the tenant) 1^ virgates, 6 acres, and a messuage here.31 In October, 1272, William Fitz John de Fentre being dead, his daughter and next heir, Petrondla, recovers one-third of a mes suage and a quarter virgate in Westwal, against the tenants (Richard, son of John le Smyht and Jane his wife), of which William, her father, died seized.32 Cijettom Cete, a hut (plural Cecen) and tun, an enclosure, are the two Saxon words presumed to have contributed to the name variously written Ceatinton, Catinton, or Chetton.1 An enclosure of huts probably furnishes a very accurate idea of a Saxon village; but Chetton, before the Conquest, had acquired a comparative dignity which its earliest name by no means implies.

The latter too is a most pro bable consequence of the sometime seigneury of the Countess Godiva. Chetton must have been part of her dower, and it was not the only Shropshire Manor where she had a similar interest. She was the widow of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, who died August 31, 1057, and the mother of Earl Algar, who died in 1059. How long she survived her husband, and whether she survived her son we are not informed.5 Gratitude for some fiscal benefit has, after the manner of Anglo- Saxon idolatry, preserved the memory of this lady in a civic puppet show, the particulars of which, not altogether decent, may be sought elsewhere. Her personal beauty is also remembered; but her noble lineage is buried in antiquity and doubt,6 whilst her intercessory cares in the^ cause of religion are wholly forgotten. All praise be theirs who, living in a barbarous age, have left a name which com mands respect, even when associated with a vulgar and tasteless tradition ! Tenfold honour be to one who, thus distinguished, was only a woman ! The Domesday Hundred of Catinton is not given, but the order two hints of Domesday, and it is clear that some such consanguinity conveyed to her reputed descendants, the Earls of Chester and Lincoln, a considerable inte rest in the latter country. A recent publication (The Topographer and Gene alogist) commenced with a most able article on the old Earldom of Lincoln. The writer mentions the Countess Godeva without directly questioning the tradi tions regarding her ; but, according to him, any statement derived fromlngulphus and the Croyland Charters, is to be re ceived with suspicion ; moreover, he evi dently intends to exclude Godeva from the Ancestry of the forementioned Earls. For the particularswhich Dugdaleadopted concerning her, I must refer to his Baronage (Vol. i, pp. 9, 10) and History of Warwickshire (Vol. i, p. 135 in Thomas' Edition). 4 The Annotators give no other expla nation of the leuua or leuga of Domesday, except that which implies a measure of length. It is obvious that, in such passages as the above, an areal measure is intended by the word which, in default of any English equivalent, I have translated league. As the question is one which can only be solved by the contextual circum stances under which the word appears in Domesday, I may, for the present, post pone it. 5 A Godeva is mentioned as holding Madeley, in Staffordshire, after the Con quest (Domesday, so. 249, a. 2), but her identity with the Countess seems too much to assume at once. 6 The Countess Godeva is said to have been sister of Thorold, Saxon Sheriff of Lincolnshire. This statement is rather corroborated than contradicted by one or"], [222, "166 CHETTON. of its mention, the circumstances of its tenure, and its geographical position, all combine to fix it in Alnodestreu. The Earl holding it in demesne, in 1085, was, as we have seen, enabled to grant, about 1086, a third of the tithes of Ceatinton to his Collegiate Church of Quatford.7 No subsequent mention has, however, occurred of tithe possessed here by the Canons of Bridg north ; and, this usual correspondence wanted, we may he mistaken as to the locality of the Earl's grant. It was probably after the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, and by King Henry I, that Chetton was granted to a subject. Who was the original Feoffee we know not, hut it was one who also had a grant of Great Berwick (near Shrewsbury), from the Crown, and of Eudon (afterwards Eudon Burnell), from the ante cessors of Fitz Alan. It is likely that the three grants were nearly contemporary, and it is certain that before King Henry II had reigned twelve years the whole fief had lapsed to a sole heiress, whose Christian name was Damietta. She was ere that time (1166) married to Ranulf de Broc, a Royal favourite, whose notoriety, though great, is little associated with Shropshire. His interest in three several Manors demands, however, that some particulars of him should he here given. He first occurs in Hampshire, where, in the fiscal year, ending Michaelmas, 1156, he had been excused 8s. 3c?., his quota of the Danegeld assessable on that County, and also 20s. of the scutage levied on the Knights of the confiscated See of Winchester.8 In each case this acquittance was directed by writ of the King, as also was 2s. 9c?., his share of a donum contributed by the said County, in 1158. In the latter year he accounts to the Crown 20s. for cen sorship of the Royal Forest of Witingelega, Hampshire. It was about this time that Henry II, calling this Ranulf de Broc, his Usher and Mareschall (Hostiarium et Marescallum suurn) and son of Oyn Porcell, granted him a charter10 which indicates 7 The probability arises thus : \u2014 If the Norman Earls had granted the Manor, it would hardly have been called ancient demesne of the Crown as it afterwards was. Stephen's grants of Crown demesne were cancelled by Henry II. If the latter had first granted the manor, it would have stood on the annual accounts of the Sheriff, under the title, In terris datis. ,J Ibidem, 4 Hen. II. 10 Rot. Cart. 7 John, memb. 5 recto.

The Feodary of 1165 exhibits Ranulf de Broc as holding 1 fee at Piperherge under William de Windsor,12 | a fee of the Earl of Arundel,13 and 1 muntator of the Barony of Fitz Alan.14 His tenure in capite at Chetton and Berwick is not entered, and a Knight's fee held under the Bishop of Winchester, which in time of King Henry I. had been Wdliam Peverel's, was then said to be held by Roland del Broc.15 But Ranulf de Broc acquired his greatest notoriety by the part which he took in his Master's contest with Archbishop Thomas a Becket. When, about January, 1165, King Henry II had con fiscated the See of Canterbury, and pronounced sentence of banish ment on the Archbishop's kindred,16 he committed the execution of his orders to this Ranulf de Broc, who having a previous and personal grudge against Becket, took care to discharge the trust with every circumstance of cruelty. Nor did his share in the in tho County, nor can I surmise where it lay. F\u0153dera, vol. i, p. 42). I Bhould have concluded Ranulf de Broc, son of Oyn Porcell, to have been the same with Radulf Purcell, but that each is stated to have inherited his Court appointment from a different source. But the question, however interesting, does not appear to belong to Shropshire. 12 Liber Niger, i, 193, Bucks. u Ibidem, p. 65, Sussex. \u00ab Ibidem, p. 143, Salop. 15 Ibidem, p. 71, Hants. 16 Chron.

In June, 1166, when Becket, from the pulpit of Vezelay, launched the thunders of the Church against some of Henry's chief ministers, Ranulf de Broc was not forgotten.17 In a subsequent letter to his Suffragans, the Archbishop gives thc reasons for each sentence of excom munication individually.18 \" Ranulf de Broc had seized and de tained endowments of the Church of Canterbury, which were of right the provision of the poor; he had arrested, and was still keeping imprisoned, like laymen, the Archbishop's dependants.\" The struggle, which lasted for more than four years longer, is a subject of too great interest to be epitomized here. \u2014 Ranulf de Broc still farmed the vacant See of Canterbury, and Becket re mained in exile.19 In November 1 1 70 the Archbishop having been apparently recon ciled to his Sovereign at Amboise, his return to England was accom panied by a significant hint of Henry's insincerity if not of his own impending fate. He found the shore at Sandwich occupied by the Sheriffs of Kent and Ranulf de Broc, with armed attendants.20 Whatever their designs, a special conference with John of Oxford, who escorted Becket on the King's behalf, seemed to change or to postpone them. Becket landed on Dec. 1, 1170, without further interruption. Among other things, he brought with him a letter of the King to Prince Henry, ordering the adjustment of his claims on the honour of Saltwood. Saltwood Castle was then in custody of Ranulf de Broc, and remained so for a month longer at least. On Dec. 25 (Christmas Day) Becket again excommunicated Ranulf de Broc from the pulpit of Canterbury. On the night of December the 28th, Saltwood Castle sheltered within its walls four men of dark design, who had arrived in haste\u2014 from beyond sea \u2014 from the Court of Henry.51 On the morrow these men did a deed before the chapel of St. Benedict, in the Cathedral Church of Canterbury, which astonished all Christendom, which annihilated the peace, palsied the energies and shook the throne of him for whom it was undertaken ; which divested his name of each early and romantic association, and left his character for magnanimity a monument of the meanest treachery or the weakest passion.

By it were esta blished those principles to which eight years of the victim's life had been vainly devoted. Becket murdered was to the Church and Priesthood a bulwark of strength, in comparison of which the lordly presence, the blameless reputation, the lofty courage, the austere devotion, the fiery zeal, the aspiring genius of Becket yet alive, had been all as nothing. But the greatness of the subject must no longer lead us away from our concern with the subordinate actors. Of one of the four faithful servants of King Henry we shall have to speak again, and in connexion with our local history. We shall show specifically iu his case that extinction of a line which has been alleged in regard both of him and his companions, and which tradition or opinion usually inserts among the consequences of foul and murderous deeds.23 Ranulf de Broc, whatever may have been his complicity in the murder of Becket, was not one of the prominent actors. Henry could therefore retain him in a position to which the more open executors of the royal will are said never to have been recalled. At Michaelmas 1171 he had farmed under the crown the escheated honour of Henry de Essex, some time Constable of England. His account of this trust was not, as usual, rendered in detail at the Exchequer, but his veredictum thereon was accepted.23 In October, 1173, when the rebel Earl of Leicester landed at Walton, in Suffolk, he first laid siege to Hagenet Castle, which Ranulf de Broc then held for the King. The Castellan's success in this service was not so unequivocal as on former occasions. The preliminaries, which we may presume to have been settled in mid night council at Saltwood, were probably better suited to his capa- 22 This passage has not been sent'to the press without reperusal. An article appeared in the Quarterly Review of September, 1853, on the \"Murder of Thomas a. Becket,\" which has, I believe, attracted, and, I am sure, deserves much attention. The main subject will never be more fairly or ably treated. The writer however, probably from want of interest in the details of the matter, has accepted some second-rate authorities as to the subsequent history of Becket's four murderers. His notice of Williani de Tracy applies, I believe, to two individuals of the same name. The posterity of Reginald Eitz Urse continued in England, and became dernonstrably and utterly ex tinct.

The Castle of Hagenet was taken, \u2014 after however a siege of four days.24 This mischance does not seem to have compromised him with the King ; for, about three years later, when Henry, then at Bridgnorth, expedited a Royal Charter to Wenlock Priory, Randal Broc was, with other courtiers, a witness.\"25 The time of his death is uncertain, \u2014 but we have an approximate statement on the subject. It has been seen above, that in 1165 he held half a knight's fee under the Earl of Arundel. This tenure appears as one of sixty solidates of land in subse quent accounts, rendered whilst the honour of Arundel was in the King's hands. Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, who farmed the same from September 1180 to Easter 1187, left his account charged with 6s; years' rent (viz. _\u00a319. 10s.) due to the Crown, and which had accrued on the tenement of \" Ranulf de Broc.\" 26 William Rufus accounting, September 1188, for the same ferm, charges I1; year's rent (\u00a34. 10s.) on the land of Brumlega, against \"Stephen de Turuham.\"27 The latter will presently appear in the succession of Rauulf de Broc, \u2014 and we may infer that the lapse was coincident with the change of fermors of the honour of Arundel ; in other words, that Ranulf de Broc died about 1187. His issue was five daughters and coheirs; hut, as his wife Damietta survived him, her inheritance in Shropshire will have suffered no partition till her own death in 1204. On August 8 of that year, Stephen de Turuham, who had married Edeline, the eldest daughter and coheir, obtained King John's writ to the Sheriff of Southants, ordering the said Sheriff to give seizin to \" our faithful Stephen de Thornham and Odeline his wife, of the Manor of Frellehi, which was Dametta's (mother of the said Odeline), who is dead, whose heir she (Odeline) is.\" A similar precept to the Sheriff of Salop orders seizin to be given to the same Stephen and Edelina, of the Manors of Chedinton, Euden, and Berewic.28 The sole heirship of Edelina implied hy these writs of King John was a fiction, as we shall presently see ; but the work of appropri- 24 Bromton, 1089.

About Dec. 1205, he offered29 to King John three palfreys to have the royal confirmation of 15 librates of land in Ertendun (Surrey), with the Hundred, &c, which he had and held by gift of King Henry II, at a fee-farm rent of \u00a315, and hy gift of King Richard, at half a knight's fee : also, to have the King's confirmation, to him and to Edeline his wife, daughter of Ranulf de Broc, of the reasonable concession and confirmation which King Henry II made to the same Ranulf de Broc, his Usher and Marshall, of all the land and ministry of his father, &c. (reciting Henry II's charter above quoted). This fine of Stephen de Turnham secured King John's two charters dated at Dorchester, Dec. 18, 1205; the first of which confirms Ertendun to Stephen de Turnham, the King's Marshall, and his heirs, while the second recites Henry II's charter to Ranulf de Broc, and confirms it to Stephen de Turnham and Edeline his wife, daughter of said Ranulf, and their heirs. King John moreover takes into his hand, custody, and protection, both the grantees, their lands, tenures, and effects.30 It will be observed that the last charter does not call Edelina the heir of Ranulf de Broc, though it substantially ignores the claims of any coheirs. At this period then (Dec. 1205) Stephen de Turnham, of whom singly I must speak elsewhere, had engrossed in right of his wife, the whole inheritance both of her father and mother. This appropriation did not remain long unquestioned, for, within two years, Sibil de Broc was a siutor against Stephen de Turnham and Edeline his wife (Sibil's sister) for her share of the inheritances of Ranulf de Broc and of Dametta, father and mother of Sibil and Edeline. The parties came to a final concord in the King's Court at Winchester, in the ninth year of John (1207-8), and thereby Stephen aud Edeline conceded to Sibil the Manor of Chedinton, of the inheritance of Dametta.31 It must here he stated that no 29 Rot.

I may"], [228, "172 CHETTON. chirograph of this fine is preserved, and that Sibil de Broc after wards denied it. Such denial, however, I think, waa rather in the way of exception taken to its details than an absolute averment that no fine whatever had been levied. At all events Sibil de Broc became about this time seized of Chetton, unless indeed a circum stance which I have now to notice arose from some continued liti gation and uncertainty. The Testa de Nevill and the Red Book of the Exchequer supply us with several documents purporting to contain full particulars of every tenancy in capite in this County. These Rolls vary little from each other, are nearly cotemporary, and may collectively be dated of the year 1211. Not one of them contains any entry which I can associate with Chetton, except that Stephen de Turnham is said to hold lands of 100s. annual value by unknown service.32 This may or may not have included Chetton, but I incline to refer it to Berwick only, which he held at the time and transmitted to his posterity. Before March, 1214, Stephen de Turnham was dead,33 leaving his widow Edeline surviving, and five daughters and co-heirs. Edelina, after her husband's death, appears still in litigation with her sister Sibil, as also in the exercise of a power which she could only claim in virtue of some asserted interest at Chetton. The Advowson of Chetton she included in her grant 34 to Lille shull Abbey, and though the act was nugatory, it well illustrates the hints we have of protracted litigation between the sisters. In Michaelmas Term, 1219, Edelina de Broc (thus called by her maiden name in her widowhood) sued Sibil de Broc for not keeping the fine above alluded to as having been made in King John's reign. Sibil did not appear, and she, with her sureties (viz., Andrew de Mora and Wdliam de Criddon), were summoned for the quinzaine of St. Hilary, 1220.35 In that term, the hearing was adjourned to three weeks of Easter,36 of which term we have no record. In Trinity Term, however, the cause was still unheard, and owing to Sibil's non-appearance, she and her first sureties were declared in misericordia ; and she was attached hy better sureties, viz., Thomas de Chetinton and Hugh de Hollicot.37 32 Testa de Nevill, p. 55. 33 Claus, i, 141. 36 Placita apud Westm.

Of the five daughters and heirs of herself and Stephen de Turnham, the one most necessary to be mentioned here is Eleanor, who, having been wife of Roger de Leybourn, was also dead before November, 1221, leaving the said Roger generally interested in her share of her father and mother's inheritance, and specially in the Manor of Berwick. Now again we shall hear of continued litigation, and of other daughters and co-heirs of Ranulf de Broc, besides Sibil and Edeline. \u2014 At Salop Assizes, Nov. 122 1,37 William de Tatelinton and Clemence his wife, with Sibil (de Broc) Clemence's sister, sued Roger de Leyburn for the Manor of Bcrewic \" as their right and inheritance, whereof Damola their mother was seized, as of fee and right, in demesne, in time of King Richard\" (1189-1199). Roger de Leyburn appeared and pleaded that they (Clemence and Sibil) \" had another sister Lucy, of whom was no mention made in their writ, and therefore he was not willing to answer them unless the Court decided that he shovdd.\" The plaintiffs hereupon ac knowledged that they had a third sister Lucy, but pleaded that she had no concern in the present matter inasmuch as a final concord had been made in the King's Court between themselves and her. Upon this the defendant pleaded that they had yet another sister Felicia who was wife of Michael de Wancy/'J which Felicia had had two daughters, nieces of Clemence and Sibil, and that these two daughters had just as much right in the premises as their aunts, and that, they not being mentioned in the writ, he declines answering except under direction of the Court. Here again the plaintiffs acknowledged that they had had a sister Pelicia, and she had had daughters, but stated that she (Felicia) had received her share, and that her daughters considered them selves paid their portion of their mother's inheritance, to wit, of the land which was given in marriage with Felicia; and further they said that this Manor (Berwick) was assigned to themselves (Clemence and Sibil) towards their portion.

And William Maubanc and Lucy were to be summoned in the County of Surrey, the others in Sussex. The reason why Emma, Felicia's sister (the other niece) was not summoned appears in a notice stating that she was dead. The whole concludes with a nomination of their attorneys by the two plaintiffs. Sibil named Gervase de Wauton, Clemence named her husband, William de Tatlington. The records of Hilary Term 1222 are lost, but the cause was not then settled. In February 1223 it had another hearing, or rather was tried at Westminster with additional plaintiffs.40 In this case William de Themton (Tatlington) and Elena (Clemencia) his wife, Sibilla del Hoc (Broc) Peter de Hatot (Hotoft) and Felicia Harang (thus called by her maiden name) seek against Roger de Leburn the Manor of Berwic as the right of Elena (Clemencia) Sibil, Peter and Felicia, whereof Damietta, mother of Sibil and Felicia (Clemencia), and grandmother41 of Elena (Felicia) and Peter, was seized in demesne, &c. Roger de Leyburn now appeared and pleaded the fine of the 9th of John as a settlement of the question, so far as Sibil de Broc was concerned, she having hy that fine obtained the Manor of Chedinton as her share of Dametta's inheritance. Against the others he said that the heirs of Stephen de Turnham ought to he his warranty and to warranty he called them, viz. Thomas de Bavelingham and Matilda his wife, Adam de Bending and Alice his wife de Faye and Katherine (Beatrice) his wife, Ralph Fitz Bernard and Eleanor his wife. The trial was adjourned to the Quinzaine of Michaelmas and \" Sibil de Broc renounces (dedicit) theicyrograph \" (the fine of 9 John).

In Trinity Term, 1233, Roger de Leburn essoigns himself versus Hugh de Hovill, and Beatrice his wife (heretofore Beatrice de Faye) and versus John, son of Ralph Fitz Bernard, and others, in a plea of land. The adjournment is to the morrow of St. Martin (Nov. 12, 1233).** But previous to the latter day, viz., on the quinzaine of St. Michael (Oct. 13), 1233, a further day was given to Hugh de Neovill and Beatrice his wife, to William Branche and Johanna his wife, plain tiffs, and to Roger de Leburn in a plea of land.

On Nov. 3, 1224, a fine was levied at Westminster between Sibil de Broc, complainant (petentem), and Alan, Abbot of Lilies hull, deforciant, of the advowson of Chetton, whereof was assize of darrein presentment. The Abbot acknowledged the right of Sibil, and quit-claimed for ever to her and her heirs.47 The Abbot's claim of course arose from the grant of Edelina de Turnham, Sibil's sister, which has been mentioned above, and was apparently quite beyond the grantor's powers. About 1225, Si-bil de Broc granted Chetton Mill, worth two merks yearly, to the Nuns of Brewood.48 She must have lived to a great age, her father and mother having been married previous to 11 66,49 the former also dying about 1187, and yet Sibd surviving in 1253. She (Sibil), was some time married, viz., to William de Arundel ; but she left no issue, neither does her name occur during the period of her coverture. She seems to have died about Nov. 10, 1253, having in that year made certain grants to the Church of Chetton, which shall be noticed presently. On her death the same confusion arose as to her succession as had encumbered her heritage whilst living. On Jrdy 7, 1254, a Jury, empanelled to give account of her possessions and heirs, reported, that she had two sisters older than herself, Edelina the eldest and Clemence the youngest, \u2014 that Ede lina had three daughters, married in Sussex, \u2014 that John de Wauncye was kin to one of these daughters, John de Bending to another, and Peter de Hautot to the third (where the confusion between the issue of one of Edelina's sisters and her daughters is obvious). Of Clemence, they said, that \"she had four sons, viz. Auger, of whom she was pregnant when Wdliam de Maleseveres, formerly her husband, espoused her, and three others begotten in lawful wedlock, viz. Hamon the eldest, who, before his decease, begat William, Simon, and Alexander.\" 50 In 1255, the Stottesden Jurors said of Chetyton that it was in the King's hands, Stephen de Buterlcg holding it in the King's name till it be determined who was next heir ; and he (Stephen) answered at the Exchequer for the income, viz. \u00a312. 2s. 6c?. per 47 Pedes finium, 9 Hen.

The same Jurors reported the various elemosynary grants which Sibil de Broc had made out of this Manor, and the loss which resulted to the Crown in consequence.51 The report of this Jury is an appropriate comment on the inaccu racies of the post mortem inquisition above quoted. Another such Inquisition was ordered by the Crown, and made its report on 7 Feb. 1256. Calling the deceased \"Isabella\" de Broc, the Jurors said that \" the service due to the Crown from Chetton was that of one man in North Wales, \u2014 that Sibilla left no heir, hut three sisters. Of these the Jury knew not whether Odelina had any heir; Alicia had two daughters, Emma and Felicia; Emma had one son, Peter de Hamtoft ; Felicia had one son, Nicholas de Wancy. Clemence (the third sister of Sibil) had one son, viz. Auger de Tatlinton. These three (viz. Peter de Hamtoft, Nicholas de Wancy, and Auger de Tatlinton) were heirs of Sibil, and were of full age.\"52 Neither does this return seem to have been satisfactory, \u2014 for, on 16 June following, a third Jury made its report, viz., that Sibil's three sisters were EdeUna, formerly wife of Stephen de Turnham ; Alice, of William Harang; Clemence, of William Malesoveres. Alice had two daughters : Emma, the eldest, of whom was born Peter de Hotoft; Felicia, the youngest, who was mother of Nicholas de Wancy. Clemence's first-born son was Auger de Tatlinton. The said Peter, Nicholas, and Auger were of full age. Of the age of Edelina the Jurors knew nothing ; 53 nor indeed were they likely, seeing that she had been dead thirty years. Except that the name of Sibil's sister Felicia is written Alicia in these returns, I see no reason to question their correctness. Lucy, Sibil's fourth sister, once wife of William de Maubanc is not mentioned, probably as having deceased without issue.

Upon this the latter was sued by the Crown, in a \" plea that he should^ allow the King to present.\" The cause was heard at Westmin ster in Easter Term, 1260, and ended in Auger conceding, as far as he was concerned, the right to the King, bu tonly hac vice. The King had thereupon a writ of the Justices to the Bishop of Hereford.55 Following the history of the third of Chetton thus retained by the King, we find it six years afterwards granted to Robert Corbet, of Chaddesley, in fee, with a third only of the Advowson. The King's charter is dated at Kenilworth, on 25 August, 1266, and is expressed to be in reward of faithful sendees.56 The time and place make the nature of these services sufficiently obvious. Within four years of this time Robert Corbet was dead, having however obtained possession (according to one account) of the other two-thirds of Chetton, and certainly having disposed of all interest derived under the King's grant in manner following : \u2014 As Robert Corbet, Lord of Chetynton, he grants to Sir Robert Burnel 1 acre in his demesne in Chetynton, and the advowson of the Church, as far as it belonged to him, and the homage of Hugh de Holycote.

The escheator is to take security for the said service and for his relief if any he due, and then give him seizin of the said third.60 On the 12th of May and 28th of June following, the King inspected and confirmed by Royal Charter the two grants which Robert Corbet had made to William Corbet and to Robert Burnel respectively.61 60 Finis, 54 Heu.

John de Hull was to perform the service.64 In 1283, the King's escheator citra Trent is ordered to seize into the King's hand &c., the lands &c, of which William Corbet had died seized.65 Aug. 22, 1283, an inquest held at Chettington on the death of William Corbet, reported that \" he held in capite of the King a messuage, garden, &c. in Chetington ; and also two-thirds of two carrucates of land in demesne ; that Sir Roger Corbet was his next heir and of full age : also that the said tenure was by serjeantry of \" doing service of one footman in the King's army, when it shall have happened that there be war between the King and the Prince of Wales, at the cost of the said William, till the same footman shall have consumed half a swine (baconem) in the same expedition.\" \u00b06 In 1284, Roger Corbet holding the Manor in capite, the outfit of his deputy is more fully described.67 \u2014 The man was to take 1 bow, 3 arro^^ and a caltrop,68 and also a cured hog, and, when he reached the King's army, he was to deliver g to the King's Marshal half thereof and the Marshal was to give \" him daily of the said half bacon for his dinner, as long as he staid in the army, and he was to stay with the army as long as the hog pp lasted.

The Sheriff being ordered to summon the said Thomas and Nesta, the former appears and (apparently) states that the King at request of Robert de Val had allowed Nesta (her right of remarriage, I presume) .72 In March 1316, the said William Corbet appears as Lord of Chetton.73 HOLLICOTT.

If this he correct, Hugh de Holicote must have been husband of Sibil, daughter and sole heir of Geoffry de Criddon ; and further he will have been dead in 1274 when the said Sibil had remarried.80 June 23, 1297, William Hohald, of the Mill, grants to William his son and Mahil his (son's) wife, and heirs of their bodies, all the land of Alan at Holycote, with a messuage in the same, of which Sir Roger de Holycote had enfeoffed the grantor.

The existence of a Church here in 1086 and some early notices of the Advowson thereof, have already been set forth. About 1253, Sibil de Broc gave a virgate of land, worth 16s. per annum, to the Parson of the Church of Chetyton in pure and perpetual alms, to find a Chaplain to sing the mass of Saint Mary.84 She also gave about the same time to the same Church an acre of land and a fish pond (servarium), which were of 6 pence annual value. In 1291, the Church of Chetynton with the Chapel of Lustone (Loughton) is returned as annually worth \u00a316. Thc Rector of Conede (Cound) had a portion therein worth 4s. per annum. The Abbot of Wigmore is also said to have had a portion of 10s. therein.85 However, in 1341, the taxation of the Church is stated at \u00a316. 4s ., the Abbot of Wigmore's portion being excluded. At this time the Assessors rendered account of \u00a37. 4s. 4c?. as the value of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb in the parish. The difference between this sum and the Church taxation arose thus : \u2014 Three carrucates and three virgates of land lay unfilled from the poverty of the tenants : the estate (fundus) of the Church with its rents and lands annexed were worth 29s. ; the tithe of hay was 13s. 4c?. ; the small tithes, offerings, and other profits were worth 13s. 4c?., as by inquisition had been determined &c.86 In 1534, the Rectory of Chetton, then held by Humphrey Burnell, was worth, in glebe and great and small tithes, =\u00a313. in gross. The charges on this sum were Procurations 7s. 8c?. ; Bishop's triennial visitation 17s. 9c?.; the Abbot of Wigmore's pension 10s. ; and the Rector of Counde's pension (here stated at) 5s. So that the net value was \u00a310. 19s. 7c?.87 The Rector of Cound had also pensions in the Churches of Easthope and Acton-Round. I can only account for this iu one way, viz. that when the Church of Cound was founded, the founder (probably a Fitz Alan or some predecessor of that house) endowed it with tithes in several quarters, viz. in Easthope, Acton Round, Eudon (Burnell), and perhaps Criddon.

Similarly the Abbot of Wigmore's pension may have been a com position in lieu of tithes ; those of Eudon George perhaps. The early subjection of Loughton Chapelry to Chetton is a matter on which I will not attempt a conjecture. INCUMBENTS OF CHETTON. The first Rector of Chetton, of whom we have record, was that Richard Folyott, who, having been presented by Sibil de Broc before 1255, was dead in 1260, when the King, after a law-suit with Auger de Tatlinton, had the next presentation.88 A vacancy again occurred in the year 1278, previous to which, as we have already seen, Robert Burnell had become the Patron.89 His career is well known, and that he became Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1274. On occasion of the vacancy of this Church in 1278,90 Master Ralph de Witham, Archdeacon of Bath, writes to the Bishop of Hereford (Thomas de Cantilupe) in behalf of Philip Burnell. The Bishop suspends the matter, on account of the absence of the presentee, and grants that no time shall run against him, if only the Church be properly served. On July 22, 1278, the same Bishop commits custody of the Church to Sir Richard, Parish Priest of Chetton, till the feast of All Saints (Nov. 1), in the name of Philip Burnell, Clerk. On October 29, 1278, the same Bishop grants letters dimissory, pro hac vice oidy, to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, to take order about Philip Burnell' s admission to this Rectory. The Patron named is Sir Hugh Burnell. May 27, 1279, Sir Malcolm, Canon of Wells, is instituted, on presentation of Sir Hugh Burnell. Aug. 19, 1284, Sir Nicholas de Hereford, Canon of Hereford, is instituted, on the same presentation. Dec. 21, 1285, Roger de Lectone is instituted, on the same presentation. 30 Ed.

Looking consequently for a Saxon original of the first syllable we hesitate according to the different ways in which the word has been spelt. If the Domesday orthography (Eldone) were the most authentic, we should at once adopt the Saxon \u00c6lb or Ealb (old, ancient) as the said first syllable. But the Domesday form is a solecism, and uniform custom, as well as local pronunciation, point out Eudon as the truer name. If so its more probable component will have been the Saxon word Copu (genitive, Gope an ewe), or else Cop (the wild ash).

Accordingly in 1165, Ranulf de Broc appears as holding under Fitz Alan, by service of 1 muntator, of old feoffment, which shows that the grant to his wife's ancestors was previous to the death of Henry I.3 We have recounted the deaths of Ranulf de Broc about 1187, and of Damietta, his widow, about 1204. On August 8 of the latter year, we have seen King John ordering the Sheriff of Shropshire to give seizin of Euden to Edelina, wife of Stephen de Turnham, as if daughter and sole heir of the said Damietta.

How or when Clemence, one of the said coheirs, recovered Eudon as her share, and conveyed it to her husband William de Malesoures, we are not informed. At Salop Assizes, November, 1221, William Malesoures appears as a juror on a Great Assize? a circumstance which indicates such position in the County as can alone he ascribed to his previous seizin of his wife's inheritance. Also at the same Assizes,4 though under his other name (William de Tatelinton), he appears with Clemence his wife, and Sibil her sister, in a suit against their nephew, Roger de Leyburn, wherein Berwick was claimed by the plaintiffs. William de Tatlinton appears again in this suit in February, 1223, and perhaps in Michaelmas Term following.5 And further of him I can say nothing, except that he left by his wife Clemence four sons, viz. Auger, of whom Clemence was preg nant at her marriage ; Hamon ; and two others, unnamed. Hamon was again father, before 1254, of William, Simon, and Alexander.6 But following a more regular order of events, we find, from the collective evidence of three Rolls of Fitz- Alan's Barony, that about the year 1240 Simon de Frankleg was holding half a fee in Eudon Maleseverez.7 This I can reconcile with nothing but a conjecture that the said Simon was second husband of Clemence de Broc, and that he thus became possessed of Eudon for her or his life, as the case may have been, but probably for hers only. I find nothing of the issue of Clemence till the year 1250, when Auger de Tatlinton (her eldest son) had fined 5 merks with the Crown for some writ,8 the subject of which may have been con nected with the following suit. In Michaelmas Term, 1253, it appeared, before the Queen and Council at Westminster, that William de Tatlynton, who was essoigned in a plea of land against Auger de Tatlynton, had not yet been viewed. \" And Master Symon de Wanton (a Justiciar) comes on his behalf and says, that he is well of the infirmity for which he 3 Assize Roll, 6 Hen.

Afterwards he comes, and has a day given him. This suit con cerned land in Worcestershire. In 1255, a Stottesden Jury, of which Auger de Eudon was one, returned him as Lord of Eudon Maleseveres. It contained half a hide, and was held of John Fitz- Alan by service of one Montar, for half a knight's fee. He owed suit to the Sheriff's tourn twice a year, but not to County or lesser Hundred Courts, because his ancestors rendered no such suit, nor did he pay strehvard, nor motfee.10 In January, 1256, William, son of Thomas de Tatlinton, was suitor against Auger Fitz-Clemence, for two carrucates in Eudon, hy writ of entry. William appeared in due course, but Auger came not. The premises were seized into the King's hand, and the parties summoned for Saturday after the octaves of the Purification, i, e. Saturday, Feb. 12th.11 In September, 1257, William de Tatlinton had an assize of novel disseizin against Adam de Faintre and his wife.12 In 1259, William de Tatlinton accounts half a merk for having an assize13 (probably the same matter). At the same time Auger de Tatlinton accounts two merks for license to accord.1* In 1260, Auger de Tatlinton accounts half a merk for a writ of appone.15 This was perhaps in connexion with his suit against the Crown as to Chetton Advowson. On April 23, 1262, a fine was levied at Westminster between Aunger de Tallington, plaintiff, and Richard de Eslewode, deforciant, as to the customs and services which Auger required from the free tenement which Richard held of him (Auger) in Eudon, viz., one virgate of land, &c., whereof Auger required that Richard should pay 7s. annually, and do suit every three weeks at Auger's Court at Eudon ; and that Richard and his heirs should render homages and reliefs to Auger and his heirs.

For this acknowledgment Auger undertook to warrant the premises to Richard and his hens.16 But the litigations of Auger de Tatlinton were endless. \u2014 In Trinity Term, 1263, he appeared in a suit against John Fitz- Alan, his Suzerain.17 \" Whereas the King had caused it to be enacted, that no one, hy reason of his tenement, should be distrained to do suit to the Court of his Lord, except he was bound to do such suit hy the terms of his feoffment, or he and his ancestors had done such suit prior to the King's first transfretation (1230), Auger now sued John Fitz-Alan in a cause as to whv the said o *' John distrained him (Auger) to do suit to John's Court at Acton \" (Acton Round). John Fitz-Alan appeared not. The Sheriff had not summoned him, hut sends word into Court that the said John had the King's letters of protection as long as there was war in Wales. The Sheriff was declared in misericordia, and the cause adjourned to Michael mas Term. We, however, hear no more of this case, probably owing to the troubled state of the kingdom. On the Pipe Roll of 51 Hen. Ill (1267), Auger de Tatlingeton appears as having been amerced 40s. for non-prosecution of some suit ; but a note is added to the entry, to the effect that he had accounted for such fine in the Roll of last year, under Worcester shire.18 And further of him in connexion with Eudon I can say nothing. His interest here was very likely sold much about the time when he seems to have conveyed his share of Chetton to Robert Corbet, and the next whom I find possessed of Eudon was Hugh Burnell, who had a charter of free-warren here in 9 Edw. I (1281),19 and whose tenure hereof under Fitz-Alan remained to his descendants, and is still memorialized in the name of the place. In 1284, Hugh Burnell holds Eudon of Richard Fitz-Alan, of the honour of White Minster, by half a knight's fee.50 The account of him and his successors is postponed to a future occasion. We may quote, however, from the Pleas of the Crown of October, 1292, the record of an affray which happened here some years previously, 16 Pedes finium, 46 Hen. III.

William is a fugitive, and is suspected. He has been summoned (at five County Courts by the Sheriff \u2014 the usual process), and is outlawed. He had no chattels. The vills of Eudon Burnell and Chetynton did not make pursuit (of the fugi tive) so they are in misericordid. Afterwards it was proved that said William had chattels, viz.

The subjoined scheme of the descent of Ranulf de Broc, some time Lord of Chetton and Eudon, is intended to illustrate the otherwise complex narrative which is now concluded. Its accuracy in each particular is not maintained. It is only a selection of pro babilities from a mass of contradictory evidence. If compared with the foregoing narrative, it will, however, serve one purpose better than a more lengthened commentary, \u2014 the purpose, namely, of ex hibiting those inconsistencies which sometimes occur in the minutes of the Law Courts, as well as in the returns of local juries. \u2014 It will be seen how the want of previous acquaintance or fa miliarity with the places and persons concerned, affected the verbal accuracy of the Law Scribes, both of those who worked in the cen tral Courts of Westminster, and those who went with the Justices on their various circuits ; and yet how these functionaries seldom failed to catch the spirit of a plea or to record it intelligibly. \u2014 It will also be seen how Country Juries, with greater accuracy as to names, local and personal, were often mistaken as to the facts of a remote time or place, and were still more ignorant as to the legal bearings and importance of such facts. 21 Plac.

Crida (Cpi.a) was the founder of the Saxon Kingdom of Mercia, about a.d. 586. Though we need not presume him to have had to do with this humble locality, it is very possible that, after his era, his name became common in Mercia, and that one so called was some time possessor of the place. It is not mentioned in Domesday, but at all subsequent periods it appears as a sole Manor held under Fitz Alan. Like Eudon, it was and is in the parish of Chetton. The falling off from the Domesday Hidage, of Eudon and Glazeley (both Fitz Alan's Manors) is observable. It may be accounted for by some early dismemberment of each, and the same cause may have led to the establishment of a third and independent Manor, like Criddon; but, as I have said more than once, the general accuracy of the Domesday survey, as regards this quarter, is sus pected. An attempt, therefore, so to combine several consequents as to tally with a doubtful antecedent, need not be ventured. In 1165, Robert de Critendon is registered as holding, by service of 1 muntator, of Fitz Alan's Barony.1 Oct. 1219, William de Criddon was a surety for Sibil de Broc.2 Among pleas at Salop in August, 1226, was an assize of novel disseizin as to whether Adam de Dodinton, Alexander de Caus, Alan de Thedestiel and Alan his son, had disseized William de Crigdon and Richolda, his wife, of a free tenement in Thedistiel (Tedstill) . \u2014 Verdict for the defendants.3 In 1240, William de Cradelton, Gridelton or Cridelton, is variously entered as holding, by service of half a knight's fee, in the place from which he is named, and under John Fitz Alan.4 On November 12, 1240, we have a fine6 which shows clearly what 4 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 48, 49. s Pedes finium, apud Salop, 25 Hen.

The said fine was between Geoffry de Griddon, plaintiff, and Wdliam de Middelton, tenant, of half a knight's fee and 1 virgate of land in Griddon (Criddon) and Godestil (Tedstill), whereof was an assize of mort d'ancestre. The former tenant (William de Middleton) renounced his right on receipt of five merks. The Inquest of 1255 (as printed) again exhibits this place and its owner in a false orthography. \" Geoffrey de Breddon is Lord of Breddon, and holds in capite of John Fitz Alan. Therein is one fourth of a hide (the virgate of the fine). He does suit to the Hundred Courts ; pays stretward 1 penny, and motfee 2 pence.

In Feb. 1262, Geoffry de Cridon, as a Regarder of the Forests, was amerced.8 In March, 1262, and Sept. 1263, he appears on Juries ;9 again on Jan. 26, 1270, and with Hugh de Holicote ; and on two Juries in April, 1278, which are the latest notices I have seen of him. Sibil, his daughter and sole heir, succeeded him. This lady was, if I am not mistaken, the wife of four successive husbands ; the first of whom, Hugh de Crediton, was dead before January, 1256, when Sibil, his widow, sued Wdliam Okeman and Sibil, his wife, for a messuage in Crediton, as her dower, and recovered the same.10 At the same Assizes this Sibil (called daughter of Geoffrey de Criddon) was sued under writ of mort d'ancestre for a virgate in Deuxhill. The plaintiff in this case was non-suited, Sibil proving that she was not tenant of the premises.11 As her father was living it is probable that her interest in Deuxhill, whatever it was, accrued with her first husband, and that he adopted the name of Criddon from his residence here. Her second husband, Hugh de Holicote, has already been noticed in 1268, 1270, and 1272.13 Also the deed attested by Geoffrey 6 Rot. Hund. ii, 82. 7 Ibidem, p. 81; vide infra, p. 196. 8 Plac. Forest.

The right was the defendant's.18 This calls to mind Sibil's interest in Deuxhill in 1256. How Henry le Waleys, the next whom I find possessed of Criddon, succeeded thereto I cannot say. He, however, entailed the estate on Fitz Aer, by fine levied in 1306, and which purports to be between Hugh le Fitz Aer, plaintiff, and Henry le Waleys, defendant, of 1 messuage, 1 carrucate of land, and 100 shillings rent, in Criddon (Salop), and of \u00a310 rent, in Franbarew (Warwickshire). The right is acknowledged to be Henry's, who concedes all the premises to Hugh for life, with remainder to William, son of said Hugh Fitz Aer, and Christiana, daughter of John de Redmarleye (wife of William I suppose).17 In March, 1316, Alina Fitz Aer is returned as Lady of Criddon ;18 and, in 1397-8, Criddon was held by Margaret Criddon by half a knight's fee, under Fitz Alan.19 A few inferior tenancies must have notice : \u2014 In January, 1256, Agnes de TedstiH accused Thomas and Philip Horde and Ralph de Ruton, for breaking open her house at night.

NOW MIDDLETON SCRIVEN. This Saxon town (tun), like all other Middletons, will have originally been so called with reference to certain other localities between which it stood. But it is vain to conjecture such relations, seeing that 450 years may have elapsed between the time when a Mercian town received its Saxon name, and the time when such name first became matter of written record. In other words, we do not know, within 450 years, when any ordinary village of Mercia was established, and still less do we know what at the time of such establishment were the adjacent villages, or what two of them were of sufficient importance to suggest the denomination of a third.

But of Fitz Aer and Fitz-Albert we shall hear more elsewhere. Here we will only mention the undertenants of each at Middleton, distinguishing them or not as best we can. FITZ AER'S MANOR. Warin de Middelton, who, in November, 1194, was a recognizor in the assize mentioned under Hollicott, was, I suppose, Fitz Aer's tenant here. In the cause in question it is observable that his essoigner was Roger Fitz Edwin.* On Sept. 26, 1199, a fine was levied at Salop between Warin de Middelton, plaintiff, and Richard de Overton, tenant, of one virgate in Overton (an adjoining Manor) whereof had been a trial of mort d'ancestre. Warin made over his claim to Richard and his heirs, receiving 15s.5 At Salop Assizes (October 1203), the Stottesden Jurors reported 4 Supra, p. 181. 5 Pedesfi nium, 1 John, Salop. 1 Domesday, so. 255 a. 2. 5 Liber Niger, i, 143.

Be that as it may, in 1255, the same Geoffrey de Criddon (written \" Breddon\") was Lord of a part of Middelton, viz. 1 hide, which he held in capite of John Fitz Aeri (written \" Cleri \") . He did suit to County and Hundred Courts. The whole Manor paid stretward \u2014 8 pence, and motfe \u2014 16 pence7 (the sums proportionable to 2 hides). How or when Geoffrey de Criddon or his daughter alienated this tenancy I cannot say. She was still living in 1284, and at a subse quent period has been noticed in a transfer of rents at Deuxhill to Edmund de Mortimer. This may be taken in conjunction with the fact that, in 1284, Thomas de la Hide held half the vill of Middleton of Edmund de Mortimer, Edmund of John Fitz Aer, John of Richard Fitz Alan, by service of one-fourth part of a knight's fee, and of the honor of White-Minster.8 In March, 1316, Thomas de la Hyde was returned 9 as one of the Lords of Middleton in Stottesden Hundred. FITZ ALBERT'S OR ROSSALL MANOR. About 1170-80, Stephen de Midelton is a witness to a charter of Osbern Fitz Hugh, Lord of Richard's Castle which related to Badger.10 In Nov. 1194, Stephen de Middelton was a Recognizor in the assize mentioned under Hollicott. His essoigner was Adam de Middleton.11 At Salop Assizes, Oct. 1203, Stephen, nephew of one Robert, sued Vivian de Roshall, under writ of mort d'ancestre, for a bovate in Middleton, which he claimed as Robert's heir. Vivian appeared and said that he claimed nothing in the premises except as guardian of a certain infant whom he brought into Court.

Stephen rejoins without contradicting Robert's seizin, but believes him to be dead. However, as Stephen produces no witnesses (sectam) of such death he takes nothing, and the Assize remains sine die.12 In 1255, Hamo de Middelton was returned as joint Lord of Middelton, holding i hide there of Thomas de Rossale, and doing suit to the Hundred Courts.13 From 1259 to 1262, he was one of the Agistators of several Royal Forests, and rendered account of his receipts in 1267. u In Sept. 1263, Hamo de Middleton and Richard Clericus de Middleton sat as Jurors on an Inquest concerning the age of Robert de Beyssin (of Wrichton &c.) .15 In Sept. 1272, Hamo was one of the Jurors who sat for Stottes den Hundred at the Assizes.16 In 1284, the daughters and heirs of Richard de Middleton appa rently hold half the Manor of Thomas de Roshall, and Thomas of Richard Fitz-Alan &c.17 At the Assizes of Oct. 1292, Alan, son of Hamon de Middleton, and William Snell, of Middleton, are reported, as making default of attendance, by the Stottesden Jury.18 In March, 1316, John de Roshale is returned as one of the Lords of Middleton, the former sub-tenancy having apparently expired.19 At this period Thomas de Roshale was head of his house, and presumed to have been seigneur over John.

On March 21, 1340-1, John Martin was instituted on presenta tion of the Crown. The Bishop's precept thereon is addressed to the Dean of Stottesden.24 On May 16, 1354, Sir Nicholas de Brentemersch, Chaplain, is in stituted to this Church on presentation of Sir Roger de Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore. On June 15, 1363, William Squier, Priest, is instituted. this place, which the note explains as \" Cheillers.\" This is a double confusion, viz, with Chetton and Chelmarsh, both in the same Deanery of Stottesden, and valued distinctly en the same page of the record. Perhaps, however, the name of Middleton became Chidleton in this instance by confusiou with Criddon. We have before had the same confusion resulting in such compounds as Cradelton, Gridelton, and Cridelton. (Vide supra, p. 191.) 24 Mr. Blalteway seems to have con sidered that a precept to the Dean of Stottesden was conclusive evidence that this Middleton was the one intended. But there was a contemporary Chapel at Middleton Priors, also in Stottesden Deanery, and to which, at this period, the Crown will have had the right of pre sentation. However, the latter chapelry was usually associated with Deuxhill, and that distinction between the two Mid dletons may have guided Mr. Blateway. In 1340-1 the minority of Roger de Mor timer, of Wigmore, will have entitled the Crown to present to any vacant Church of his patronage. 21 Inquis.

Aston or Eston, wherever it occurs, implies a town situated to the East of something else. If this Aston and the hamlet of Weston, about four mdes distant, were each so called with reference to some common centre, we can fix such centre nowhere but at Monk Hopton. Howbeit no early mention of the latter will warrant a presumption of such by-gone importance as might have reflected a name on its neighbouring localities. We infer from Domesday how Aston acquired its distinctive addition of Eyre. Aer and Eyre are softened or corrupted forms of Alcher,1 whose name appears thus in that Survey \u2014 \" The same Rainald (Vicecomes) holds (under the Earl) Estone, and Alcher (holds it) of him.

In the first three he held, as at Aston, of the fief of the Sheriff; in Harcott his tenure was immediately of the Earl. Thus it was that his descendants became tenants in capite of the Crown, a circumstance which affords many helps in clearing up their succession and history. But the name of Fitz Aer is also associated with those records of faith and devotion, which, while they facilitate all genealogical inquiries, invest them with their chief interest and perhaps their only use: Before Domesday was written, and while Warin the first Sheriff of 1 Hist.

Shropshire was yet alive, it is probable 3 that Alcher had formed the design of conferring his lordship of Albrighton on the then founded Abbey of Shrewsbury. Certain it is that the grant was completed before the death of Earl Roger. His descendant, very possibly his son, was that Robert Fitz Aer, whom we have already mentioned and must presently recur to, as founder of the Church of Aston, about A.n. 1138. 4 In 1165, the whole tenure of Robert Fitz Aer under the Barony of Fitz Alan involves the full service of 1 knight and 1 muntator, and half the latter service in addition.5 The Knight's service was that which was due on Aston. Within ten years of this period, Robert Fitz Aer will have died, leaving a son and heir of the same name. The first notice of the latter is in a deed of the Salop Chartulary, which mentions him under the name of Robert Fitz Robert, as having been at issue with that Abbey about the burial of his men of Eston. This dispute took place whilst Adam was Abbot of Salop, that is, between the years of 1167 and 1175, and was settled by Roger, Bishop of Worcester. This Prelate probably officiated in consequence of a concurrent vacancy of the See of Hereford. He decided in favour of the Ab.ey, his assessors being apparently Ralph, Prior of Worcester, and Humbald, Prior of Wenlock.6 Between January and September, 1176, when the Justices ap pointed under the famous statutes of Northampton first visited Shropshire, they amerced this Robert Fitz Aer in a sum of 4 merks for some default.7 Half of this fine was then paid, and the re mainder subsequently. In the fiscal year ending Michaelmas 1180, Shropshire had been taken in the circuit of the great Justiciar, Ranulph de Glanvill. A still heavier fine had on this occasion been inflicted on Robert Fitz Aer. He had been convicted of & false presentment, had neglected to do homage (as a tenant in capite), and owed his relief for a certain Serjeantry (Harcott of course). His total liabilities amounted to \u00a35, of which he paid 50s. in 1180, 16*. in 1181, and the balance in 1182. 8 3 Domesday, 255 b.

Having come into possession of his estates about the same time as his Suzerain (the second William Fitz Alan), this Robert Fitz Aer appears as a prominent witness in certain charters of that Baron. He attests the two deeds which secured to the Canons of Haughmond the site of their house and the endowments of their founder.9 He also stands first witness to a charter whereby Wm. Fitz Alan recognizes the right of Shrewsbury Abbey to some land in Oswestry.10 The year 1190 may be assigned as the proximate date of all these deeds, and also of a further dispute which the same Robert Fitz Aer had with Shrewsbury Abbey as to the right of Advowson of the Chapel of Estun.11 We have now to speak of him in another relation. \u2014 About the year 1191, as far as we can judge from subsequent records,13 this Robert Fitz Aer, with several others, was challenged (appellatus) in the Courts at Westminster for the murder of Richard de Brigida, a dependant of Matthew de Gamages of Stottesden. The appellant was Adam de Brigida, brother of the murdered man. The challenge was ultimately withdrawn against all parties, but not till Robert Fitz Aer had suffered a voluntary imprisonment of some duration, and his whole estate been seized into the hands of the King. It was either just before or during this temporary forfeiture that John le Strange obtained possession of Withyford, by writ of the Chancellor (Longchamp, Bishop of Ely), directed to the Sheriff of Shropshire. As another locality was principally con cerned in this matter, we shall here give only such particulars as are necessary to a chronological account of the family under notice. Longchamp's writ to the Sheriff was an act of Sovereignty, and must have issued whde he was Viceroy of King Richard, that is, between June, 1190, and October, 1191 ; limits which must also be assigned to his judicial visit to Hereford, at which, as John le Strange afterwards alleged, the Chancellor and his fellow-Justices awarded Withyford to the said John as his right, and not merely for custody. After Longchamp's expulsion, the Viceregal Office was discharged by Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, and his assessors. To them, before Michaelmas 1193, Robert Fitz Aer offered a fine of ten two charters are contemporary aud attested by the same witnesses. 9 One of these deeds is printed (Mon. vi, 108, ii), where this witness's name is given as Robert Fitz Haber.

It remained an entry on the Rolls of four following years, and on being renewed in the seventh year (a. d. 1200), the Barons of the Exchequer cancelled it as having been comprehended in a more recent fine,11 presently to be mentioned. Meanwhile (that is, in the years 1194 and 1195), a suit had been progressing in the Law-Courts between Robert Fitz Aer and John le Strange, about Withyford. The latest mention of Fitz Aer the Plaintiff, is probably of date May 12, 1195, when John le Strange essoigned himself as being in the King's semee in Wales.15 A day of ad journment (probably July 1, 1195) was given, but the records of that and many subsequent terms are lost. However, we know that Robert Fitz Aer lived neither to conclude his suit nor liquidate his fine. During the fiscal year, which ended Michaelmas 1198, the widow of Robert Fitz Aer, viz. Emma de Say, accounted 20 merks into the Treasury, being her fine for having custody of the land and heir of said Robert, \"which land he (Robert) held in capite of the King, viz. nine librates of land, and for having marriage of the heir and of herself.\"16 The heir in question was another Robert ; but before we enter on his history, we should mention, that his father having an interest in Newton (near Ellesmere) , had granted the whole thereof to the Canons of Haughmond, and concurred with Emma, his wife, in bestowal of their bodies, when dead, to receive rites of sepulture in that Abbey. To this deed were witnesses : William Fitz Alan, Alan de Hadley, Reginald de Hesding, and Hem-y Mauveysin,17 \u2014 a com bination which suggests a date at least five years previous to the death of the Grantor. This is hardly the place to follow the suit about Withyford, which Emma de Say still prosecuted against John le Strange. Suffice it to mention its settlement by final concord at Salop, on Sept. 25, 1199, and that it was agreed that Robert, the infant son of Emma, 13 Mag. Rot. Pip., 5 R. I. Salop, Nova Oblata. 14 Rot.

The decision was \" Habeas etatem suam ;\" equivalent, I presume, to an adjournment. Soon after this Robert Fitz Aer in, will have been of full age, for his consent is certified to a grant which Lewellyn Prince of Wales, then Lord of Ellesmere, made to Haughmond Abbey.20 He further attests as Robert, son of Robert Fitz Aer, a deed of Ranulf de Rodinton, which must have passed before 1211 ;31 and in the latter year is similarly designated, as holding his serjeantry (of Harcott) in capite of the Crown.33 On July 3, 1221, King Henry III, being then at Bridgnorth, issued his precept23 to the chief Forester of Salop, commanding him \"to permit Robert Fitz Alier (Aher) to assart and cultivate his rifflet pertaining to his wood of Estun, where the road goes down towards Salop, between the brook and the boundary (horam) of the aforesaid wood of Estun.\" The object of this permission was, that \" the said road might be safe and secure for passengers in those parts, and that they should neither meet with harm to their goods nor persons, from the malefactors of that neighbourhood, by reason of the said rifflets.\" u At Salop Assizes (Nov. 1221), Robert Fitz Aer was of the Jury which had to try \" a great Assize.\" 25 The next who occurs in this succession was William Fitz Aer, who before Michaelmas, 1231, stood pledge for Walter de 23 Rot.

In 1256, John Fitz Aery was returned amongst those who hold ing fifteen librates of land were not yet knighted.33 In 1271, he was both a Knight and Sub-cscheator of the King in this County. His conduct in the latter office was variously re ported of three years afterwards. The Jurors of the Manor of Ford complained of some extortion of his, after the death of James de Audley,34 whde the Jurors of Wenlock said that \" after the death of Prior Aymo, he entered the Priory, and there discharged his duties well and faithfully,\"35 an almost singular exception to the statements which were given as to the conduct of the fiscal officers of the Crown at that period. At the Shrewsbury Assizes, of October, 1272, he appears both as a Knight and Juror of the \" King's Grand Assize.\" 36 He was also unsuccessful in a suit against a tenant who pleaded that his tenure was not under the said John, but under Margery, John's mother, and so evaded the main question.37 This Margery will therefore have been the widow of William Fitz Aer, above alluded to, and identical with that Margery de Harcott who, at these same Assizes, was returned as failing in due attendance.

Stephen's seizure of the Crown of England was so ably planned and so daringly executed, that nearly two years elapsed before men's minds were awakened to a sense of its iniquity. Shropshire, ever foremost in a cause of faith and legitimacy, was stirred in the spring of 1138, by two young Barons, who, owing their position to the favour of King Henry I, were bound to the cause of his daughter by gratitude no less than fealty. The greater of these was William Fitz Alan. He sacrificed everything in the ensuing struggle \u2014 his honours, his offices, his estates, fifteen of the best years of his life, all but a name for matchless truth and constancy. \u25a0 We may suppose his conduct to have been generally followed by his feudatory tenants ; and one of them was Fitz Aer.

So intense and so complicated became the great national struggle that we know little, save of its beginning and its end, and that not from any one contemporary chronicle. But a rudely sculptured stone and a scroll of parchment stdl exist, ample records of an act of private benevolence and devotion in that age of hatred and ungodliness. A Church was built, endowed and consecrated at Aston Aer, and we may learn both the time, the agents, and the objects of its foundation. \" Know all men,\" says the record, \" both now and hereafter, that on the day of the dedication of the cemetery 47 of Eston, I, Robert, son of Aher, gave to God and to the Chapel of the same vill of Eston one virgate of land containing sixty acres, and all tithe of my demesne of the same vill, and one mansion, for the health of my soul, and of all my predecessors, and successors.

In the Parish of the Church of Morville were several, and among them \"one at Eston, to which Robert Fitz Aher gave sixty acres, and all tithe of his demesne, and one mansion.\" This deed also mentions \"the defence of the poor\" as one of the objects which the Bishop had had in view. It also contains several regulations as to the subjection of these Chapels to their Mother Church, and so to Shrewsbury Abbey.49 4? The meaning of the word Cemetery must not be restricted by modern ideas, but will rather be obtained from the earliest ages of Christianity, when the members of a persecuted faith being driven to worship in vaults and burial- places, a Cemetery became only another name for a Church.

With that date for the foundation of the Church some archi tectural remains of the original structure are in exact accordance. The door-way and tympanum, of which a drawing is herewith given, I understand to be the chief features illustrative of the question of date. The dispute between Salop Abbey and Robert Fitz Aer, as to the burial of his tenants at Aston has been already noticed.00 Its settle ment by Roger, Bishop of Worcester, about a.d. 1170, seems to have been in accordance with the rules laid down by Robert, Bishop of Hereford, at the time of consecrating the Church. About 1190,51 William Chaplain, of Aston, having resigned his Chapel into the hands of William (de Vere), Bishop of Hereford, that Prelate committed cure and custody thereof to Peter Chaplain, of Hopton. At the same time he writes to the Abbot of Shrews bury, acknowledging the Advowson to belong to that house, and stating that he had granted such custody of his own authority, and not on presentation of Robert Fitz Aer, or any one else, but with full observance of the Abbot's right. His reason for writing, he says, is that no act of his may be construed by the said Robert into an acknowledgment of his- (Robert's) claims on the Advowson. He concludes with exhorting the Abbot to listen to his (the Bishop's) request in behalf of the fore-mentioned Peter, whom he entitles a \" discreet person.\" The nature of this request will appear forthwith. The same William \" by divine grace, the humble servant of the Church of Hereford,\" addresses \" all sons of Holy Mother Church to whom these present letters shall come.\" He signifies to them all, that \" Robert Fitz Aer in his presence, and when many both of the Clergy and Laity were present, orally and voluntarily confessed that he had no right of presenting any one to the Chapel of Estuin, but that the Advowson thereof did belong, and still belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Salop.\" And that no doubt should arise about this matter in future, the said Bishop put to the said letters the testimony of his seal.53 As a sequel to this very intelligible piece of diplomacy, the same s0 Vide supra, p. 37. 51 Salop Chartulary, No. 340. 42 The original deed in possession of Mr. George Morris. \u2014 A transcript con tributed by him to the Collectanea Topo graphica et Genealogica, vol. v, p. 177."], [267, "HEAD OF DOORWAY ASTON EYRE."], [268, ""], [269, "ASTON EYRE. 209 Bishop issued another letter 53 to the sons of Holy Mother Church, informing them, that, at the presentation of his most beloved brother H. by divine grace, Abbot of Salop, and of the Convent of the same, he has admitted Peter Chaplain of Hoptun, to the said Abbot and Convent's Chapel of Eston, and has canonically instituted him perpetual Vicar in the same Chapel \u2014 in such sort however, as that the same Peter shall hold the said Chapel with its appurtenances as his ancestors (predecessors) held it, to wit, with one virgate of land^jn the vill of Eston, and a third of the custom ary corn-tithe of the whole arable land.

Bishop consecrates it. It happens to be in a district where a great Abbey claims a prescriptive parochial jurisdiction, but by no means taxes itself with such a cure of souls as would necessitate the found ation of more Churches. In process of time, the said Abbey not only appropriates part of the endowment of the district Church, but claims a right of presentment to the residue. The founder's heir remonstrates or contests the matter. The Diocesan Bishop is the Judge. He awards the right of Advowson to the Abbey, his ex pectation being that he himself shall nominate to the existing vacancy. Wicked as was the fiscal element of Henry the Eighth's Reform ation, truly it was, in its very wickedness, but a measure of retri bution !

In 1341, the Parochial value of Aston Aer must be similarly gathered from the general statement as to Morville and its Chapels, which has already been given.58 In the valuation of 1535, the Chapelry is not mentioned ; but in 1545 we have seen that the Curate of Wheaton Aston had a salary of \u00a35. 16s. 0_d., chargeable on the Cell or Grange of Morville.59 Of the early incumbents of Aston Aer, I can say no more than has been implied above. The first Hereford Registers appear to take no notice of such a Chapelry. #Ia^Hep. Glas-lle in British, signifies \" green place,\" an etymology which we can hardly hesitate to accept for Glazeley. If this be right, it is further observable how Anglo-Saxon usage changed the British term lie (a place), into its own term leaj (a district); for after Domesday we generally find this vill written Glas-Zeg. or in some form associated with the Saxon rather than the British termination. Such change was natural between words so nearly allied in sound and sense, but we need not reject an obvious British etymology because it became adapted to a prevalent Saxon usage. 65 Salop Chartulary, No. 345. 56 Salop Chartulary, No. 344, vide supra, p. 204, note 30. 57 Pope Nich.

Of \u00c6lward the Saxon, we merely observe that his three Alno destreu Manors, Oldbury, Eudon, and Glazeley, all devolved to the fief of the Norman Sheriff. Of Glazeley, it further appears, that, like other Manors held by Azo under Rainald at Domesday, Azo's interest came to be repre sented by the elder house of Le Strange, under Fitz Alan. The Manors to which this remark applies are Glazeley, Abdon, Berring ton and Lega (now Longnor); but Streford is perhaps an exception. We know not when Azo's representatives became extinct, or gave way to Le Strange; but there is every probability that Azo's Domesday fief helped to constitute those 2 fees of new feoffment which in 1165 were held by John le Strange, of the Barony of Fitz Alan. Glazeley, undoubtedly, was thus circumstanced. I shall have that to offer under Abdon and Longnor, which will be much more pertinent to the question of Azo's succession than anything which I have found in connexion with Glazeley. Here we had better speak of those whom I take to have held Glazeley under John le Strange, from the first period of his own feoffment by Fitz Alan. These were a family of Norman extraction, whose original name was Pierre-point (de Petri-ponte);2 but whose mem bers, seated here, came to be called \" de Glazeley,\" at first, inci dentally, but afterwards uniformly.

A grant by Guy le Strange (brother of John), to Haughmond Abbey, and which probably passed in 11 79, and shortly before the grantor's death, is attested in the third and fourth places by Simon de Petri-ponte and William Clericus, whom I take to be the same two witnesses.4 In November, 1194, Simon de Perepont was one of the Visors in a law-suit already mentioned under Astley Abbots. His Essoigner was \" Alan de Gleseleia.\" 5 In Easter Term, 1200, he, Simon, was one of four knights who were to choose a jury to try an assize about land in Northleg (Norley Regis).6 At Salop Assizes, 1203, Simon de Pierrepoint appears in various relations: 1st, as a Knight and Juror of great Assize; 2dly, as amerced for some transgression ; and 3dly, as defendant in a suit, wherein Roger de Wadeleg accused him of disseizing him (Roger) of a tenement in Wadeleg.7 In this suit, Simon was successful, and retained the premises. At the same Assizes,8 the Stottesden Jurors presented that Matthew de Gamages (Lord of Stottesden) had challenged Richard le Veil, and Alan de Petraponte, and others, for the murder of his man. The County Court however testified that the said Matthew appeared some time in said Court, and complained of the murder of Richard, his man, and that some of Matthew's servants also appeared and challenged said Richard le Ved and Alan de Petra ponte, and others ; but that Matthew did not make the challenge, but attorned Philip his Seneschal to prosecute the matter with the other challengers (appellantibus) . The Jurors of Stottesden were here upon declared to be in misericordid for a false presentment (pro falso die to) . This murder had been committed ten years before, at least. It was the same, of which Robert Fitz Aer being suspected, had suffered imprisonment. He had been acquitted, and was now dead ; but at these Assizes, the charge was renewed against several persons, and failed in each case, on the ground of previous acquittal. Thus Geoffry Dilum challenged Alan de Petraponte for the aforesaid murder.

Although Alan was declared innocent, and had leave from the Court to return home, and although the chal lenge was declared null, and the appellant fined half a merk for its falsity, it appears that the reception of Alan, while under challenge, was a misdemeanour on the part of his Brother William. The latter had anticipated the consequences by fining half a merk with Geoffrey Fitz Piers (Chief Justice), in composition of his fault. John le Strange was his Surety for this fine, which however appears to have been increased to 10s. by the Justices in Eyre, for which also John le Strange was pledge. I cannot help thinking that Alan and Wdliam de Pierrepoint were sons of Simon, and that the former succeeded to Glazeley. In 1214, Alan de Petriponte had been amerced,9 apparently by Peter, Bishop of Winchester, for some disseizin. He had paid the fine in two instalments. The same Alan has already appeared under Quatford, in Novem ber, 1221.10 The next who occurs in this succession was Guy de Pierrepoint, otherwise called Guy de Glazeley.

But he did no suit, except twice a year at the Sheriff's town, nor did he pay stret ward nor motfee .- the Jury knew not the ground of either ex emption.16 At the Salop Assizes, of January, 1256, Ralph de Arraz and Alan Fitz Wydo, are each found offering a merk for license to accord their suit. They have such license and a cyrograph.17 Accordingly a fine remains on the Rolls to this effect.18 \u2014 \" This is the final concord between Ralph de Arraz and Jane his wife, Plaintiffs ; and John le Straunge, whom Alan Fitz Wydo calls to warranty, and who comes forward with such warranty, &c, con cerning 8 virgates in Wadeleg (except 6s. rent), whereof was suit at law. Ralph and Jane acknowledged the right of the others, quit as regarded themselves and their heirs. For this John le Strange gave the plaintiffs 40 merks.\" In Feb. 1262, Alan de Glasleye appears as one of the regarders of the Forests of Mors and Shirlet.19 Between the years 1266 and 1269, this Alan de Glaseleye attests both the charters which Robert Corbet of Chetton granted in re lation to that manor.20 At Salop Assizes, October 1272, John de Glaseleye and Alan de Glasleg were Jurors for Stottesden Hundred.21 Nov. 30, 1274, John de Gleseleg was one of the Jurors who re ported on the misconduct of public officers &c. in the Hundred of Stottesden.

I have before said that mention of a Priest in connexion with any Domesday Manor perhaps indicates the coexistence of a Church.40 We have, in case of Glazeley, a confirmation of that surmise, more apposite than could ordinarily have been expected. We learn in fact, that about thirty years after Domesday, the Church of Glazeley was of such standing, as that Ingelbert, the Priest thereof, claimed in an Archidiaconal Chapter, then held at Castle Holgate, a parochial jurisdiction over the neighbouring Manor of Deuxhill.41 The latter belonged to Wenlock Priory, and the dispute very probably arose in consequence of the Monks having founded a Chapel there. All that need be said of this matter here is, that Richard, Bishop of London, then Viceroy of Shropshire, and presiding judicially in the said Chapter, rejected the claim of the Rector of Glazeley, on the ground that all St. Milburg's lands constituted but one Parish. In 1291, the Church of Glasleye was valued at _\u00a34; but the Priory of Wenlock had a portion of 6s. 8d. therein, which belonged to the pittance of the Monks.43 In 1341, the Church of Glaseley, in Stottesden Deanery, is entered as valued at \u00a34. 6s. 8d. But the Assessors and Vendors of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb in the Parish, render account only of 19s. \u2014 The reasons of the difference were, a want of sheep and lambs, the non-cultivation of 1 virgate of land through poverty of its tenants, and because the glebe, hay-tithe, offerings, and other small tithes went to make up the greater sum (the taxation), and were not included in the ninth.43 In 1535, Deuxhill and Glazeley were united Parishes. Peter Griffith was Rector. Their collective value in glebe and great and small tithes was \u00a34. 13s. -Id. ; but a pension of 8*. payable to Wenlock Priory was chargeable on that value.44 The Prior of Wen lock's return gives this pension as receivable from the Rector of Deuxhill.45 an instance of endowment, specially de voted thereto, see Hist.

How or when the combination with Deuxhill, which existed in 1534, first commenced is a question, \u2014 possibly to be solved by some retrospective document of a later period than that of which we treat, perhaps by some yet undiscovered Chartulary of Wenlock Priory.

The Domesday ortho graphy (Dehocsele) would favour the former derivation, while thc situation of the place would correspond well with the latter. As regards the first syllable or syllables, involved in the letters Dehocs or Deuks, I can offer little even in the way of conjecture. Tlie word is perhaps the possessive case of some personal noun, disguised by change, or wholly obsolete. The nearest Saxon name which I have met with is Dudoc or Duduc. Domesday notices the Manor thus1 \u2014 The same Church (St. Milburg) held (in time of King Edward) and still holds Dehocsele. Here is half a hide geldable.

Wenlock, a Monastery which, of all in Shropshire, boasted the most exclusive privileges, both spiritual and temporal, retained this Manor from the Conquest to the Reformation. The Chartularies of Wenlock being either hidden, scattered, or destroyed, we can know but little of its dependencies. On the change of the Hundredal divisions of Shropshire, supposed to have taken place in the time of Henry I, Deuxhdl was probably attached to Stottesden Hundred. But when, in time of Richard I, a new Liberty or Hundred was assigned to Wenlock Priory, its distant and isolated Manor of Deuxhdl was undoubtedly included. Therefore, from the Inquisition as to the \" Liberty of Wanlok,\" made in 1255, we learn that the Prior of Wenlock is Lord of Dewkeshul, and that it contains half a hide.3 An extent of the possessions of Wenlock Priory, taken Sept. 1379, gives the rents of the free tenants in the hamlet of Deukeshull, as 20s. per annum, payable at Lady Day and Michaelmas.3 3 New Monasticon, vol.

Sibil's defence was, that William de Deukes hull and Margery his wife held the land, and so said the Jury. Therefore, Juliana was non-suited.6 But she renewed her suit against the real tenants, and at the same Assizes. The question now was, whether Robert Fitz Owen (Audoeny), her uncle, died seized of a messuage and virgate in Deukeshul, which Wdliam Fitz Pretre (le fiz le Prestre) and Margery his wife held. These tenants proved Juliana not to be heir of Robert, because she was born before her mother was married. So she was again non-suited.7 The fine of 1293 which entitled Edmund de Mortimer to a rent of 20 quarters of corn in Deuxhdl, has already been given under Criddon.8 THE CHURCH OF DEUXHILL. The foundation of a Church or Chapel here by Wenlock Priory, possibly as early as a.b. 1115, has been noticed under Glazeley. At the Assizes of October, 1203, Robert Chaplain of Deukeshull, occurs as surety for another Chaplain, Adam de Hereford, who had died.9 In 1291, the Church of Deukeshull with the Chapel of Mitletone (Miccletone or Suttlcton) is entered as not of \u00a34. annual value.10 The Inquisition of 1341, which enumerates the parishes of 4 Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 215. 5 Monasticon, vol. v, p. 81, No. xii. 6 Salop Assizes, 40 Hen.

The name Elric, otherwise Alric, -Elric, or Aluric, appears in nearly every Hundred of Shropshire in the time of the Confessor, and Edric, son of a Saxon Aluric, retained Burton (near Much Wenlock) after the Conquest. Though more than one person must be represented by the name, it seems likely that the Elric, who held Estone in King Edward's time and Aluric, who, at the same period, held Udecote (Woodcote) in Recordin Hundred, were iden tical. The successor to each Manor, in 1085, was one, whose name Tochi, or, as above, Tochil, was surely Saxon ; nor is there any ex travagance in the conjecture that this Tochd was one of a favoured few, and was permitted to hold, under Norman Lords, two distant Manors which were his by descent. This early association between Aston and Woodcote becomes still more striking when we find a record of law proceedings, wherein the Lord of Woodcote was, after lapse of more than a century, suing the Lord of Aston for the latter Manor. Of Tochil, the Domesday owner of Aston, we know nothing further than that early in the twelfth century he granted to Shrewsbury Abbey a hide of land in the vill which was called Cota ; and it is observable, how, in the two confirmations of Henry I and Stephen, which record this gift, the donor's name is spelt with exactly the same variety as in Domesday.* The next date at which we may expect to find a successor to any Domesday tenant of Rainald is the year 1165 and amongst the tenants of Fitz Alan. Of these there is one whose fief I cannot assign elsewhere, whose tenure was one Knight's fee, such as after wards was Aston Botterell, and whose origin was, if I rightly judge by his name, Saxon. This was Robert, son of Luun, to whose ancestry, whether he were Lord of Aston or not, we may now revert, for at least two generations. About the year 1115, there was a great Chapter held at Castle Holgate, by William, Archdeacon of Hereford. Richard, Bishop of London, then Viceroy of the County, and other great persons, both Clerks and Laymen, were in attendance. \u2014 Lunun is named amongst those who are most associated with this neighbourhood.5 To him succeeded Robert Fitz Luun, who being dead before be given at length hereafter.

In September, 1161, Robert Fitz Louun renders account of his fine of \u00a320. It had gone to pay for works at the Castle of Blanc muster (Oswestry, then in the King's hand as caput of Fitz Alan's Barony), and he was quit7 In 1165, Robert Fitz Luun is registered as holding i Knight's fee of Fitz Alan's Barony.8 When this family became extinct in the male line, or how the family of Botterell succeeded to Aston, I cannot say. An interval of forty-five years elapsed between the latest notice of Fitz Luun, and the earliest of Botterell. In Easter Term, 1200, William Boterell appears as the third of four Knights who were to choose a Jury of the King's Great Assize.9 The cause concerned lands in Norley Regis, and the other three Knights were of Stottesden Hundred. Hugh de Sidbury precedes William Boterell, otherwise we might have hesitated as to whether the latter was of Aston, or whether the contemporary coheir of Robert Corbet's Barony, whose position in Shropshire was very high, had officiated on this occasion. Whether, or how nearly, they were related is still a question. Among the fines which had been recently offered to the Crown at Michaelmas, 1202, was one by Robert de Wudecot of 10 merks, that he might have trial (pro habendo recto), concerning one Knight's fee in Eston, against Wdliam Botterell.10 A similar entry prior to Michaelinas, 1203, gives the same Robert, as fining and paying 20s., that the suit which was in the County Court between him and William Boterell, concerning one Knight's fee in Eston, be transferred to the Courts at Westminster.11 In Easter Term, 1203, at Westminster, a day was giv^n to Robert de Wodecot, plaintiff, and William Boterell, in a suit about one Knight's fee, viz. in 3 weeks of Easter,13 (i. e.

Matilda pleaded that she had only resisted the right during hay harvest (tempore fenacionis), and she had the same liberty at that season as the King had in his Forests, because that Forest (the Clee) was once Royal. Thomas rejoined that his ancestors had purchased from the ancestors of Matilda a right of pasturage throughout the year, for 2s. and 12 hens (rent, I presume). Presently Thomas declines to prosecute. His consequent amercement was excused at instance of Sir R. de Clifford.27 As a supplement to this concord with Maud de Longespee (the heiress of the Cliffords and Lady of Corsham), we may instance Thomas Boterel's attestation of her Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, which must have passed within a year or two of the last date.28 Also about this time Thomas Botterel, Knight, stands third witness of Robert Corbett's grant in Chetton.39 At the County Assizes, October, 1272, Thomas Botterel appears both as a Knight and Juror.30 It would appear that he was sometime Constable of his Suzerain's Castle of Clun, and that for some alleged excess in that ofiice, Geoffrey le Venour, Seneschall of Sir Roger de Mortimer, about October, 1273, maliciously caused the cattle of the said Thomas to be seized on his own land of Eston Boterel, and to be driven to Cleybury, and there detained tdl said Thomas had paid 18s.31 On Nov. 27, 1274, Sir Thomas Boterel sat as foreman of the Jury which then made report as to oppressions and excesses by the King's Officers and others in Stottesden Hundred.33 To their return we owe the above particulars as to Thomas' own withdrawal of the suit of his Manor of Aston; also as to his transaction with 24 Rot.

Necton (Norton), Forde, Heywode (Haywood), and Toteneye, by performing the service of 1 Knight's fee, and doing ward at White- Minster Castle in time of war.36 He will have survived this date but for a short time. He seems to have married Petronilla, widow of Wido de Hadnall, and after he became a Knight to have had, with her, a grant of lands in Hadnall, from Sir Thomas de le Lee,36 which grant was afterwards (1296-7) confirmed by John de le Lee, son of Sir Thomas, to Richard, son of Thomas Boterell. This Richard had succeeded his father at Aston Botterell before October, 1292, when he was summoned to answer at Salop as to his warrant for claiming a right of fair, market, and free-warren, and the privilege of assizing bread and beer in his Manor of Eston Boterel. In reply was produced the Charter of King Henry III, granting to Thomas Boterel, ancestor of said Richard, and whose heir Richard was, that said Thomas and his heirs should have for ever a weekly market on Tuesdays, in his Manor of Eston, and an annual fair of three days, viz. the vigil, the day, and the morrow of St. Michael. And Richard said that he claimed such market and fair by the aforesaid charter, and the privilege of assizing bread and beer, as appurtenant to the said fair and market.

The circumstance seems to have escaped Mr. Blakeway, whose remarks (p. 204 of the Sheriffs) seem to have been influenced by this charter.

So the pyrakantha is called by the Crimean Tartars Shaitandeken, words which have precisely the same meaning.1 The rhamnus catharticus, a plant similarly obstructive to agriculture is well known among ourselves as Buck-t/torn,2 a name which involves the same ideas ; for bug (Brit, bwg) is literally a fiend, and Puck, whom we pleasantly remember as the servant of King Oberon, was in his primitive capacity, nothing more or better. Another pro vincial name of a weed occurs which associates the same ideas still more emphatically, though less presentably.

The Continuator of William de Jumieges,4 enumerating the nieces of Gunnora, Countess of Richard I, of Normandy, mentions one who married Nicholas de Bascheritvilla (vulgo Bacqueville), and was mother of William Martel and Walter de St. Martin. The locality whence this Nicholas had name is situate in the Pays de Caux, and is often written Bascevilla and Basqueville, forms more nearly corresponding to the English surname. This place continued as the fief of Martel for at least two centuries. Also, south-west of Rouen, and in the Forest of Roumare, was a place variously written Balkierville or Boscherville, and which gave name to the great Abbey of St. George there founded. From one or each of these places there came to England a family whose branches were already in several Counties at the period when we first have authentic record of such matters. At the beginning of the thirteenth century there were Baskervilles in Herefordshire, Northamptonshire, and Shropshire, in Warwickshire, Norfolk, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, and possibly in other Counties. No reasonable ground has yet occurred to my notice for further asso ciating any two of these branches, except that the Shropshire and Northamptonshire branch was identical, and also had lands in Herefordshire. Yet these are not to be confounded with the Bas kervilles of Eardisley in Herefordshire, however difficult it may be always to preserve the distinction. I have indeed a printed pedigree before me which professes to derive these houses from a common origin; but the details on each side are so purely imaginative that I cannot regard the result as a truth, at least not on this evidence. Their respective tenures in Herefordshire were at Bradwardine and Eardisley, places not four miles asunder : not only was their surname identical, but the Christian names adopted by either house were generally similar : perhaps also each of them held, somewhere and at some time, under the same feudal superior, Lacy of Ewyas. Their consanguinity is therefore most probable, but any attempt to exhibit such genealogical relation circumstantially, as it must arise in fiction so must it end in incredulity. The two families were in fact distinct, from the earliest period at which we find records bearing on such matters. In 1165, when Robert de Baskevill (whom I take to have been of Erdisley), was holding 5 Knights' fees of Hugh de Lacy, in Herefordshire f Radulf de Baskerevill is entered as holding 1 fee Liber Niger, i, 153. 4 Norm.

Ralph was, I believe, progenitor of the Shropshire famdy, and to him and his succession I must here confine myself. His tenure under De Port in Herefordshire was probably at Bradwardine, and was represented by a tenure of his descendants under Braose (who subsequently enjoyed De Port's Barony). I will first notice Ralph's occurrence in Shropshire, without his Christian name. The Pipe Roll for the year ending Michaelmas, 1177, records that Roger Fitz Henry and Baschervill, had fined with the Crown for according a duel.7 Their fine was 40s. and a dapple horse. The money had been then paid, but the horse re mained a debt till the year 1182, when Ralph de Baskerville appears on the Pipe Roll for Herefordshire, as still owing the said horse, and a further and recent amercement for trespass in the King's Forests.8 The money was again paid, but the horse remained a charge against his name in 1183.9 In explanation of the quarrel between Ralph de Baskervfile and Roger Fitz Henry, I can only suggest that they were neighbours in so far as that the former had an interest at Pickthorn and Aldenham, and the latter at Cleobury North, though the greater possessions of each lay elsewhere. There is a deed in the Chartulary of Shrewsbury Abbey10 to the following effect : Ralph de Baskervill grants to the said Abbey the Church of Northburia (Norbury, Staffordshire), at request of his mother Juliana. \u2014 Witnesses : Roger de Ewias, Eitropius, Herbert and Robert de Hereford, Roger de Baskervdl and Ralph his brother, Robert Christian, Henry de Girois, Adam de Baskervill, Richard Sadoch, &c. \u2014 All I can venture to state about this deed is an opinion that it passed between the years 1165 and 1190, and that the grantor was Ralph Baskervill of Pickthorn. If so, the said Ralph wdl have been also a tenant of Lacy, in whose fief Norbury was contained. The point chiefly to be noticed in this deed is, however, that it combines places or names connected with the three Counties of Salop, Staf fordshire, and Herefordshire. We must now revert to thc year 1167, and state that about that * Ibidem, p. 151. 7 Mot. Pip. 23 Hen. II, Salop. 8 Rot. Pip. 28 Hen. II, Hereford. 9 Ibidem, 29 Hen.

The entry on the Pipe Roll of 1167 is as follows : \"The same Sheriff (Geoffrey de Vere) renders account of 16c.. of the land which Ralph de Bascervill held in the same vill (Stottesden) . It is paid.\" The next year 1168, under the title of Proprestures, the Sheriff accounts for 16 denariates of land which Ralph de Baschervill held (tenuit) in Stottesden, and he is quit?3 Simdarly under the title \" of Proprestures and Escheats,\" this rent of 16c.. (being obviously for a Propresture), is substantively entered on every Roll,13 till that of the year 1190 (2 Rich. I), when this and some similar rents being collected by an Escheator rather than the Sheriff, the former renders account of 16c.. of the land of Ralph de Baschervill, and is quit.1* In 1191, 1192, and 1193, and for half the year 1194, the Sheriff answers summarily for the \" Escheats of Shropshire \" in each year, but the total in each case must have involved the rent of Basker ville's purpresture.15 In this interval, viz. between September, 1 190, and March, 1194, Ralph Baskervill was murdered in Northampton shire, as will presently appear. For the half-year ending Michaelmas, 1194, an Escheator, and not the Sheriff, collected the rents of escheats and purprestures. Among his receipts was 8c.. for the firm of \" Piketorn Tom\u00e6,\"16 i. e. Thomas de Baskervill's land of Pickthorn ; and the name of Ralph's son and heir was, as we shall see, Thomas. 11 Rot.

And William de Braose says, that neither King, nor Justiciar, nor Sheriff ought to set to his hand in his (William's) liberty.\" \u2014 The imparlance remains sine die, till the King's pleasure thereon be ascertained.

But Roger's enjoyment of his estates continued not long.

Several notices of this Roger de Baskervill, we also find mention which shows the continued con nexion of his family with Northamp tonshire. A Roll preserved in the Testa de Nevill, aud of date c. 1242, gives Roger de Baskerevil as holding half a knight's fee in Helidon (Northants) , of the honour of Clare then in the King's hand.

The Jurors of Stottesden say nothing about the vill of Pickthorn, which was in fact not in their Hundred, but in the Liberty of Wenlock ; but under the heading \" De valettis et puellis \" (i.e. of male and female wards), they say34 that \"Walter de Baskerville is in custody of Sibil Giffard (widow of Hugh, before-named) by gift of the King, and that he holds 8 acres in Pykethorn of the King, rendering yearly 16 pence at the Exchequer, and that he holds no (nullam) land of the King in this Hundred.\" For the word \" nullam,\" it is obvious that \" aliam \" (other land) should be written in this passage, for this Walter held Aldenham, Northwood, and Newton, \u2014 all of the King, and all in Stottesden Hundred. The contemporary Jurors for Wenlock Liberty said of Pyke thorn,35 that \" Roger de Baskerville (formerly) held certain land therein of the Prior of Wenlock. He rendered to the Prior 2 merks yearly, and used to do suit to the Court of the Prior by afforciament.

As to the Hundred of Wybth't here mentioned, I can associate the name with nothing in Shropshire. I believe the original statement of the Jurors to have been erroneous, and I can only venture a guess at what theyr meant. They supposed that Pick thorn had some time been attached to the Hundred of Welbetre (now Webtree) in Herefordshire, in which Hundred was Bradwar dine, a fee in which these Baskervilles had an interest as tenants of de Braose, and afterwards of de Bohun. And soon after this date (1255), Walter will have attained his full age, for his son and heir, Roger, was born Aug. 1, 1261. Nov. 27, 1274.

The career of Robert de Belesme, third and last Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, was, in that capacity, most transient. His idea of Bridgnorth as a great mditary position, and his mode of working out that idea, are the chief and almost the sole features of his temporary ascendancy in Shropshire. This subject has been so ably and amply discussed by others,1 54 Rot. Sund. ii, 110. 53 Plac. apud Westm. Trim Term, 56 Hen. Ill, memb. 13 recto. 55 Assizes, 20 Edw.

On the death of Hugh de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, in July, 1098, his elder brother, Robert de Belesme, obtained that Earldom from William Rufus. This honour he retained till the summer of 1102, building in the interval the two Castles of Bridg north and Carrechova. Bridgnorth was in every respect a mere transfer of his father's foundations at Quatford. The Castle, the Borough, the Collegiate Church, even the Bridge, followed one another from Quatford to the site selected by the ambitious and restless Norman. The skill and rapidity of Robert de Belesme's proceedings have already been sketched in these pages, and probably rated below their just estimate. At his outlawry, in the summer of 1102, his Castle of Brug stood a royal siege of three weeks duration, and was at last surrendered, rather than taken by storm. Something however yet remains to be said as to the period of his power in Shropshire, and his exercise thereof, \u2014 something which has hitherto been misrepresented, or not represented at all. The expression of Ordericus is, that \" he held the Earldom for four years, and exercised the greatest cruelties upon the Welsh.\" of the History of Shrewsbury,,Mr.Blake way gives a passage of Ordericus relative to the confiscations which ensued on the banishment of Earl Robert. His theory, founded on this passage, was that great Shropshire Estates then changed hands, and this theory is more than once advanced in his writings. I never could understand what Mr. Blakeway thus alluded to. Of course Belesme's Earldom escheated to the Crown ; but there is no proof of any other forfeiture whatever, as taking place in Shropshire at the period (1102). We may suspect indeed from Ordericus' words, and we know from other evidence, that one, two, or perhaps three Shropshire fiefs changed hands at, or about, this time ; but they were Seigneuries only that were thus affected, and so, merely a correspondent number of greater tenants. As to the revolution extending to knightly classes, I never saw a word of evidence in favour of such a conclusion, nor do I adopt it. In fact all we know of the matter leads to an opposite conclusion, viz. that the main supporters of the Crown against the Earl were the Knights of the County. Again, permanent disinheritance at this period of history was most seldom re sorted to. It was most impolitic in all instances, except those where the antago nistic power was (as in the case of Earl Robert) almost on a par with Royalty. Ordericus indeed says, that \" the King took possession of the whole honour of Robert (de Belesme), and of his vassals (hominum ejus), who had persisted with him in rebellion ;\" but Ordericus does not say whether these vassals were those of Sussex, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, or Shropshire ; nay, the only two Shropshire Chiefs who are quoted as having adhered to the Earl to the last,were Roger Fitz Corbet and Ulger Venator, aud they happen to be two whom we shall see transmitting Shropshire Estates to their posterity."], [303, "243 BRIDGNORTH. One would imagine that he was resident in his Shropshire Earldom for the whole period, and that this period was employed in con tinuous warfare on his Cambrian neighbours. Indeed, the words of Ordericus have been thus interpreted; but with how little truth remains to be shown. In July, 1098, when Earl Hugh was slain in Anglesea, Robert de Belesme was besieged in the Castle of Balaon by Fulk, Earl of Anjou, and was relieved by King William Rufus in the third week of the same month.2 There is nothing to show the precise period when Belesme ob tained the said King's grant of the Earldom of Shrewsbury. Per haps it was immediately after Earl Hugh's death, but it does not follow that he came over immediately from Normandy to take possession. It is uncertain whether King William himself returned to Eng land in the autumn of 1098, or at Easter 1099. Whichever the date of his return, it is not probable that Belesme came with him, \u2014 or, coming, remained here : for in June, 1099, the messenger who reported to Rufus, when hunting in the New Forest, that an attack had been made upon Maine, was sent from over sea, by Robert de Belesme.3 The dashing energy which the King exhibited on that occasion was perhaps the greatest feature of his life and character, but it must not detain us now any further than to say, that his instant visit to Normandy kept him there till September. As yet, therefore, there is little evidence of Belesme's presence in England or Wales during the first year of his supposed Earldom. It is well known how, within another year, his friend and patron, the King, was again hunting in the New Forest, and there received that second and sudden message which summoned him to a journey more distant than the former and final. The succession of King Henry I, though it was displeasing to, was not, that we know of, openly opposed by Earl Robert. Consequently, we are ignorant how it affected the English tenure of the latter. However, about August 1, 1101, Robert Duke of Normandy landed at Portsmouth, reckoning on the support, amongst others, of Be lesme and his two brothers, Roger and Amulph.4 The agreement between the King and Duke which resulted is well known, and how the latter left England about September 29, 1201. 4 Ordericus, p. 785. Ordericus, p. 772. 3 Ibidem, p. 774."], [304, "244 BRIDGNORTH. But now for a circumstance which took place in the interval, and which has not hitherto been made matter of history. \u2014 On Sept. 3, 1101, King Henry I was holding his great Court at Windsor. The Duke, his brother, was there, and others professedly or suspectedly of the Duke's party. What diplomatic matters engaged the great assembly we are not likely to learn, but in the ordinary routine of Court business three notable Charters were expedited, one to the Bishop of Bath, the other two to the Bishop of Norwich.5 It is one of the latter which deserves the special attention of the Shropshire Antiquary. The witnesses attested, each of them making the sign of the cross with his own hand. Among them were Queen Matdda, Robert Duke of Normandy, Robert Bishop of Chester, Robert Earl of Ponthieu (Comes de Pontivio), Roger Earl of Poitou (Comes Pictavensis), Alan Fitz Harald (so written for Fitz Flaald), Everard the Chaplain, Herbert the King's Chamberlain, &c. Here then were two, if not three, of the sons of Earl Roger de Montgomery, \u2014 for Everard the -Chaplain was most probably his youngest son, before noticed, and who became Bishop of Norwich in 1121. The point, however, here to be observed, is the attestation of Robert de Belesme as Earl of Ponthieu, a foreign title, and which he acquired in right of his wife. His partizanship with Duke Robert, or his non-recognition by Henry I, must, I think, have had something to do with the suppression of his English titles of Arundel and Shrewsbury, on the above occasion. The Duke returned to Normandy at Michaelmas, taking his most strenuous supporter, the Earl Warren, with him. And here it becomes for the first time clear that Belesme remained in England, nay, further, that he remained for the express purpose of fostering the Duke's interests and opposing the King's. Indeed, also, the account of Florence of Worcester would induce a belief that it was now that Bridgnorth was first selected by Belesme as the site best suited for future operations.6 If so the labour of workmen by day and by night, which Florence speaks of, will actually have com pleted the work in less than a year. 5 _Ve\u0153_t_b_a..Jcon,vol.ii,p.267, No. xi, and vol. iv, pp. 15, 16, Nos. iii, and v. domina quondam construxerat, fratre suo Eadwardo Seniore regnante, Scrobbes byriensis Comes Eotbertus de Beleasmo, RogeriComitisfiliu3,contra Regem Heinri cum, ut exitus rei probavit, rnuro lato et alto, summoquc restaurare c\u0153pit.\" 6 Flor.

We have seen King Henry the centre of a divided Court at Windsor, on September 3, 1102. On September 29, 1102, he presided over an assemblage at Westminster,7 equal in point of numbers and undivided in allegiance. Robert de Belesme had fallen in the interval, and was now an exde. The Palatine Earldom of Shropshire thus became an Escheat of the Crown. It is well known that kingly power, as exercised over a Palatine Earl, was essentially different from kingly power in ordi nary. Henry I now combined in his own person both the Palatine and Royal dignities ; and Shropshire might, if he had so willed, have been annexed to the ordinary and general government of the kingdom. Such a fusion however was not effected in his reign, and his policy was clearly to keep the two distinct. He governed the Province by means of a Viceroy (called Dapifer, Seneschall, and sometimes Sheriff), an office which posterity has, not without some ground, assimilated to, or identified with, the Wardenry of the Western Marches. A dispute about names is superfluous where the nature of the office is well understood ; and there can be little mistake about the functions of Richard de Belmeis, first Viceroy of Shropshire under Henry I. When called Sheriff or Vicecomes, he is so called cor rectly, because he stood in loco Comitis ; but it must be remembered that the ordinary Sheriff or Sheriffs of his Province stdl remained. When called Viceroy, the expression is warranted, both by the nature of his power and by the fact that his representation of the Earl was incidentally a representation of the King. His jurisdiction was not confined to Shropshire, or even to the Marches of Wales. It extended at least into Staffordshire, and possibly into Herefordshire. He presided over all causes ecclesias tical and temporal, and his decisions were afterwards recognized by the Crown as quasi-royal and irreversible. He was, in short, to Shropshire what, in the absence of the Sovereign, the Justiciar or Chief Justice of a later period was to England. As to Bridgnorth during the reign of Henry I, little more is known of it than that it was occasionally visited by the King, that it was a seat of provincial government, and that Belesme's fortress was maintained as a Royal Castle. King Henry I visited Shropshire between March, 1121, and June, 1123, probably about the time of the Welsh expedition in the 7 Saxon Chronicle, sub anno, \u2014 Sim.

It is addressed to Robert, Bishop of Coventry, and Richard, Bishop of London. \u2014 The witnesses were : Bernard, Bishop of St. David's, Grimbald the Physician, and Hamo Peverel.8 Another Charter of Henry I, and which must have passed about the same time, is dated \" apud Brugias.\" It is a confirmation of a previous grant of lands in Huntingdonshire, by William Peverel of Dover, brother of Hamon above-mentioned, and who had a large interest in Shropshire.9 \u2014 The King's Charter is addressed to Robert, Bishop of Lincoln (who died Jan. 1123), Robert, Bishop of Coventry (consecrated 13 March, 1121), and Richard, Bishop of London. It is attested by William Fitz Odo, and Geoffry Fitz Pagan, witnesses whose names preclude all idea of an earlier date than that suggested above. The later years of Richard de Belmeis' life were troubled with a paralytic affection, which at times incapacitated him for public business. There is, however, evidence of his having been, by dis position, tenacious of office and power ;10 and we have independent hints that he retained his jurisdiction in Shropshire tdl nearly the last. He at length retired to the Priory of St. Osyth in Essex (a house of his own foundation), and died there on Jan. 16, 1127. On resigning his provincial power to Pagan Fitz John, he attended at Bridgnorth the first Court held by his Successor, and there gave evidence as to the liabdity of Shrewsbury Abbey to contribute to the military aids assessable on the County.11 Walter Constable of Gloucester, was also present, and appears to have been officially interested in the question. The Bishop reiterated his tes timony, and the particulars of what passed on this occasion, in a letter, written subsequently, and addressed to all the Barons of Shropshire. In September, 1126, Bridgnorth became the temporary prison of Walleran, Earl of Mellent, whom the King had brought over from Normandy.13 8 Salop .Chartulary, No. 42. 11 Salop Chartulary, No. 353. 9 Plac. apud Westm.

The County of Sussex became the dower or indeed the fief of Queen Adeliza, and she conveyed it to her second husband, William de Albini, and to her heirs by him. No such result followed her alleged interest in Shropshire. In 1128, Bridgnorth Castle being in keeping of the new Viceroy, Pain Fitz John, it became the prison of Meredyth ap Lhywarch, who had been given up by Lhewelyn ap Owen.14 In the Pipe Roll for the fiscal year ending Sept. 29, 1130, we have one notice of Bridgnorth. Milo de Gloucester (son of Walter, the Constable above mentioned) , being then Sheriff of that County, had sent a quantity of wine, by the King's order, to Worcester and to Brug,15 This sending of wine was a usual item of Sheriffs' accounts. The wine was for royal use, and anticipatory of a royal visit. In exact accordance with such hints of the King having been in Shropshire about this time are the facts of his having kept Christmas, 1129, at Worcester,16 and of his having issued a precept from Cundover, which must date within a few months of the same feast.17 The reign of Stephen, generally barren of provincial records, does not, I believe, supply a single fact in immediate relation to Bridgnorth. In remote connexion with the subject, we must mention the name of Hugh de Mortimer, of Wigmore, whose power in Herefordshire and the Marches seems to have been un- after much research, have seemed most consistent ; but tbis is not the place for any general argument ou the subject. 13 William of Malmsbury, p. 99. Mr. Blakeway, quoting this passage (Hist. Shrewsbury, i, 77), says further, that the Queen on receiving the County appointed William Fitz Alan as her Sheriff. Malms bury mentions no such appointment, nor can I find it in any other Chronicler. I question it on other grounds than can be stated here, but of course Mr. Blakeway had some authority for his opinion. What follows above will at least prove that if William Fitz Alan became Sheriff in January, 1127, he held that office in subjection to Pain Fitz John, rather than to the Queen. 14 Powell, 137. 15 Rot.

In Sept. 1130, the Fermor of Boseham (Sussex), had sent 476 siccas (a kind of small fish) for the King's use to Cundover and Woodstock. The King was at Wood stock in March, 1130, and at Worcester in Dec. 1129.

In one instance we find Stephen expressly stipulating for the independence of Mor timer's fief.18 He was in all probabdity of the Usurper's party, and the close of Stephen's reign found him not only undisturbed in his proper possessions, but seized of the Castle of Bridgnorth. The accession of Duke Henry further found him caballing against the new monarch, refusing to do him homage, and fortifying his Castles for resistance. His opposition might have been formidable had the Earl of Hereford, his confederate, remained so. The latter was detached from Mortimer by the persuasions of Gilbert Foliot, his relation, and then Bishop of Hereford. Mortimer's obstinacy resulted in a second siege of Bridgnorth Castle, con ducted, as before, by the King in person. King Henry II's campaign against Mortimer is not very fully detailed by the Chroniclers,19 but their accounts are amplified and illustrated bymuch that may be gathered from contemporary Charters and by something which remains of the lost Pipe Roll of 1155 (1 Hen. II). Of the Chroniclers, by far the most accurate as to date and circumstance is the Norman writer edited by Duchesne.20 He informs us that on Sunday after the Octaves of Easter (viz. Sunday, April 10th, 1155,) the King, at Wallingford, caused the English nobles to swear fealty to Wilham, his eldest son, and, in case of the early death of that Prince, to Henry, his second son, then two months old. He then amicably settled some differences with Roger, Earl of Hereford, who was in occupation of the \" Tower of Gloucester.\" Forthwith he laid siege to the three Castles of the arrogant and self-confident Hugh de Mortimer, who resisted his supremacy. These Castles were Brug (printed Burgam), Wigemore, and Cleobury (printed Deobens). The last, after some little time, the King took, and destroyed. On the nones of July (July 7), 1155, Hugh de Mortimer made peace with the King, surrendering the two Castles of Brug and Wigmore. 18 Viz. when he granted the Earldom of Hereford to the Earl of Leicester (Duneumb's Herefordshire, vol. i, p. 232). (Grose's Antiquities vol. v, p. 3). This story rests on insufficient authority, and, like many other legends, must be wrongly localized aud dated. If Hugh de St. Clan were the hero's name and he ever behaved in the way recounted, it must have been after the siege of Bridgnorth, which he survived at least a year. 19 The most interesting fact noticed in connexion with the siege of Bridgnorth is the devotion of Hugh (or Hubert) de St. Clair, Constable of Colchester, who, obsei -v ing an arrow directed against the King hy one of the garrison, saved the Monarch's life by the sacrifice of his own. -\u00b0 Normannorum Scriptores, p. 991."], [309, "BRIDGNORTH. 249 The account of Gervase of Dover21 differs somewhat from this. He describes the King as taking all the three Castles above named, and he dates the whole affair as preceding the \" Council of Walling ford\" (a manifest error) ; but he supplies us with the names of Cleoberi and Bruges, intelligibly spelt. Ralph de Diceto, a not to be despised authority, who became Dean of St. Paul's twenty-six years after the event he is describing, seems to intimate that Mortimer fortified Bridgnorth, Wigmore, and Gloucester against King Henry.23 This latter statement is, however, hardly worth reciting, except to show bow half a century is sufficient to establish a tradition and misrepresent a fact. Such altogether is the evidence of those Chroniclers, who are most to be relied upon with regard to this period of English History. \u2014 The Norman writer is in short the best authority of the three, and will so appear if we make reference to other documents. \u2014 There are no means of ascertaining the immediate movements of King Henry after the Councd of Wallingford (April 10, 1155). It was however, to all appearance, during his subsequent march against Mortimer that he halted at Aire was in Staffordshire, and there granted to the Shropshire Abbey of Lilleshall, two distinct Charters.23 Each of them is dated \" apud Alrewas in exercitu,\" and one of them is attested by persons of whom we shall hear presently during the siege of Bridgnorth, viz. by Thomas, the Chancellor (Thomas a Becket) ; Manasser Biset, Sewer (dapifero) ; Warin Fitz Gerold, Chamberlain ; Robert de Dunstanville ; and Joceline de Bahol. A grant to Stoneley Abbey (Warwickshire) by King Henry II, is dated more significantly \" apud Brugiam in obsidione.\" M It is attested by Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury; Roger, Arch bishop of York ; John, Bishop of Worcester ; Walter, Bishop of Burton and Lichfield. His expedition, earlier in the year 1155, which took him into Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, to deal with the Earl of Albemarle and William Peverel, may possibly have occasioned his presence at Alrewas ; but I find no account of military preparation for that journey, such as to tally with the ominous \"in exercitu\" of the Lilleshall Charters. 21 Chron.

This Charter was said by the Monks of Stoneley to have been granted by the King at solicitation of his mother, the Empress.25 If so she also wdl have been at the siege of Bridgnorth, The removal which the Charter enabled those Monks to make from Radmore to Stoneley was effected on June 19th, which furnishes us with a still more accurate estimate as to the date of the siege. Another Charter of Henry II, which passed at the same time is dated simply \" apud Brugiam.26 It was to Mereval Abbey (War wickshire) . It was tested by the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth witnesses of the last; also by Roger, Earl of Hereford (thus proving the accuracy of the Norman Chronicle, which dates his adhesion to the King before the siege of Bridgnorth) ; Josceline de Bailiol ; and Manasser Biset. On the same occasion, and with a simdar date, at Brug, the King expedited a great Charter of confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey.27 Its witnesses were the Archbishop of Canterbury ; Gilbert, Bishop of Hereford (who had effected the adhesion of Earl Roger) ; Walter, Bishop of Chester; John, Bishop of Worcester; Thomas, the Chancellor ; Reinald, Earl of Cornwall (the King's uncle) ; Wdliam, Earl of Bristol (.. e. Gloucester the King's cousin, son of Robert the Consul) ; Roger, Earl of Hereford; Hugh, Earl of Chester; William Fitz Alan ; Robert de DunstanviU ; Walcheline Maminoht (all three staunch supporters of the Empress against^Stephen) ; and Roger Corbet. Other and less important Charters to Shrewsbury Abbey passed contemporaneously. One, wherein William Fitz Alan is addressed, and Thomas the Chancellor, the witness, is so far worth mention.28 Still better worth notice is the King's Charter to Robert Pinzun, of 2S Ibidem. No. vi. The year given in this document is 1154 ; of course by mistake, \u2014as on June 19, 1154, Henry II had not succeeded.

In the same documents we often find a regnal, papal, and dominical year given, which are mutually inconsistent. In such cases the dominical year is, as far as I can learn the least to be trusted. 26 Monasticon, v, 483, ii. -' Salop Chartulary, No. 36. 23 Ibidem, No. 45."], [311, "251 BRIDGNORTH. land in Eston (Aston near Newport), which is dated at Brug, ad dressed to William Fitz Alan, and attested by the Earl of Cornwall, Richard de Humez, and the now subdued rebel, Hugh de Mortimer.39 And these addresses to William Fitz Alan, then restored to his lands and honours, will cause a further citation of Monastic Charters dlustrative of the era. His grant to his own foundation of Haghmon, on the very day of his restoration, is not only a chapter of history but a memorandum of loyal faith and pious gratitude.30 \" Know all men present and future, that I, William, son of Alan, on the day of St. James the Apostle, at Bruge, for the health of my soul and of (the souls of ) all my ancestors and heirs, have given and conceded, and by this, my present Charter, have confirmed to God and to the Church of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist of Haghmon, and to the Canons, who are there serving God, the right of patronage of the Church of Wroxcestre in Salopescire, with all its endowment and with all its appurtenances and liberties, in free, pure, and perpetual almoigne &c. \u2014 These being witnesses : Roger de Powys, John le Strange, Hugh de Lacy of Colemere.\" And this grant thus made at Bridgnorth, on July 25, 1155, was afterwards remembered and certified, with additional circumstances of interest, by the first twro witnesses. \u2014 Roger Powys, about twenty years later than the grant, and about fifteen years after the death of the grantor, certified \" all sons of the Church of that which he had seen and heard, viz. that William Fitz Alan, after he had received his lands from the King, and on the day on which he took the homage of his vassals (hominum) at Bilge, in presence of an assembled multitude of Barons and Knights, for the health of the Lord King and of his own soul,\" gave the said Church to Haghmon Abbey, &c.31 And John le Strange's contemporary certificate wras mainly to the same effect, except that he uses the important word \"restored\" (reddiderat) as describing the King's investiture of the exiled Sheriff of Shropshire.32 20 Salop Chartulary, No. 162. inadvertently stated this Certificate to be in possession of Mr. George Morris (supra, p. 73, note 218).

For the sake of a more general illustration of our subject, we will now recur to the beginning of this month of July, 1155, and to the case of another Monastic House, whose Abbot sought the King at Bridgnorth on the subject of a Charter. This was Walter de Lucy, Abbot of Battle, in Sussex. His attendance at Corn's was nearly coincident with a great Council, which, after Mortimer's sur render, was summoned to Bridgnorth. Thither on July 7, came Archbishops, Bishops, many Abbots, Earls, and Barons, to settle the terms of the King's peace with his rebellious vassal.83 The Abbot of Battle reached the Court on the 10th, and on the follow ing day had audience of the King on his own affairs. Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, Richard de Humez, and Richard de Lucy (the great Justiciar, and who was in fact the Abbot's brother), are men tioned as having been present. What transpired is foreign to our local subject, which may wed conclude with the fragments of the lost Roll of 1155, so far as they allude to Shropshire.34 \" William Fitz Alan, the Sheriff, renders account of the ferm of Salopesire for a fourth part of the year, .. e. from Midsummer to Michaelmas, 1155.

The King's Manors had been wasted, and a charge of \u00a33. 5s. 5d. had arisen on that account during the quarter.\" At the same fiscal period (Michaelmas, 1155), Robert de Stafford, Sheriff of Staffordshire, charges his account with one merk (13s. id.) which in obedience to a writ of the King had been spent on the \" works of the Castle of Bruges.\" From this year till the end of the period of which we profess to give account, the history of Bridgnorth involves such a variety of details that we can no longer deal with the subject as a whole, but must bestow a distinct notice on each of its parts. We must give 33 Palgrave's British Commonwealth, Appendix, p. xxxv. The document there printed is a muniment of Battle Abbey. Nothing, however, could be better selected for the guidance of those, who, seeking for hints of English History at a period when Chronicles were scanty, do not despise such hints though found amongst Monastic Charters. The reader may there learn how these Charters were sought and obtained from the Crown ; what were the conditions and forms of procedure ; what, in short, the Court of Chancery really was when Henry Fitz Empress first reigned and Becket first held the seals. Most of the information which I have endeavoured to supply in a previous note on the same subject (supra, p. 27, note 3), was derived from this admirable Appendix. 34 Red Book of the Exchequer, so. 185."], [313, "253 BRIDGNORTH. some account of the Castle ; the Borough and its Liberties, the Col legiate Church within the Castle ; the Church of St. Leonard's, and other religious or eleemosynary foundations. \u2014 Also of such tenures, within the Town or Liberties, as will not recur to our notice else where \u2014 and lastly of the principal men and families, whose names are associated with the early Borough. THE CASTLE\u2014 Served both as a fortress, a prison, and a royal residence. Of its extent at this early period we have no direct evidence or description. The remaining ruin, part of the older structure, is a fragment, mas sive indeed, and suggestive of a grand contemporary whole, but still a fragment only. Perhaps the constant outlay of the Crown in repairs and additions is the best illustration which can be offered as to the extent of the fortress in the time of Henry II and his three successors. If we take into consideration the different values of money at that time and the present, we may estimate wdiat Bridg north Castle was, by that which it cost. The outlay on repairs and additions during the reign of Henry II was as follows : \u2014 At Michaelmas, 1166, the Sheriff's annual account contains a charge of 6s. 8d. for repair of the \" well of Brug,\" and 11s. 7d. for one stack of timber (pro uno rogo) at Brug.35 At Michaelmas, 1167, the Sheriff had expended, in obedience to the King's writ, various sums, amounting in aU to \u00a330. 13s. id. on the works of this Castle. Of this sum he had received \u00a320. 1 3s. id. from amercements inflicted by Alan de Nevdl (Justice of the Forest), and ,\u00a310. from other amercements. In 1168, the Sheriff had expended \u00a3U. 5s. 6d. on the same works. The funds thus employed arose from amercements, from rents of purprestures payable to the Crown, and from that part of the aid for marriage of the King's daughter which had been assessed on the escheated fief of Gerard de Tornai. In 1169, the Sheriff, accounting for an arrear of \u00a326. 6s. id. due for the ferm of the previous year, alleges the whole to have been expended on the works of the tower of Brug, in obedience to writ of Richard de Luci (the Justiciar), and under view of Philip Fitz Stephen, Richard Ireis, and Hulger the Clerk. He had also spent items of expenditure, which follow in the text, except where reference is made to a different Record. 35 Rot. Pip. 12 Hen. II, Salop.

Out of the reve nues arising from the Honour of the Constable which had also been farmed by Geoffrey de Vere, 18s. had been similarly appropriated, and is charged in another account of the said William Clericus. At Michaelmas, 1171, William Clericus, rendering account of arrears from the former year, charges \u00a35. Is. 7d. as having been expended on the Tower of Brug, under the same view, and by royal warrant : and Guy le Strange, the Sheriff of the current year charges yet \u00a315. 14s. 9c.. more. In 1172, Guy le Strange charges \u00a325. 2s. 2c.. for the same pur pose, and \u00a325. in 1173, \u2014 Richard de Luci again authorizing the outlay, and the same Visors inspecting it.

At Michaelmas, 1182, Hugh Pantulf, then Sheriff, had spent \u00a33. 6s. 8c.. in repair of the Tower of Brug, by royal warrant, and under view of William Fitz Simeon, Walter Palmer, and Richard de Porta. He had further spent \u00a33. 12s. in repair of the King's House at Brug. In 1183, the same Sheriff had expended \u00a310. 7s. 3d. in repairs of the Castle, under view of Robert Bacun and William de Fabrica. In 1184, he had simdarly expended \u00a37.

In 1188, the repair of the King's houses at Salop and Brug had cost collectively 11s. id., and at Michaelmas, 1189, the Sheriff had spent 5s. 3d. on the House at Brug, under view of Nicholas the Irishman. The reign of Henry II was nearly thirty-five years in length, and"], [315, "BRIDGNORTH. 255 for thirty-four years thereof the King was in seizin of Bridgnorth Castle. The expenditure in repairs and additions, recorded for that period, and above detaded, will be found to amount to \u00a3213, a stun equal to about \u00a310,500. of modern currency. At Michaelmas, 1191, the Castles of Bruges and Salop had been repaired at a cost of \u00a312. 9s. lie.., by warrants of the King (now gone on the Crusade) and the ChanceUor (Longchamp). The Visors for Bruges had been Robert Bacon, and Andrew, son of the Priest. At Michaelmas, 1193, the Sheriff charges \u00a332. 8s. 5c.. in repairs of the Tower of Brug by writ of the King (now in captivity), and under view of Richard de Overton, Henry Dyer (Tinctoris), and Henry Fitz Turold. In 1195, \u00a35. is charged for repairs of the wed and the King's house, under warrant of the Archbishop (Hubert of Canterbury) . In 1196, \u00a38. 5s. is charged for repair of the basement (pedis) of the Castle, by royal warrant, and under view of Hugh de Norton and Walter Meverel. In 1197, 7s. are charged for repairs of the house and Castle. In 1198, a charge of 75s. includes some outlay at Salop. In 1199, 18s. Qd. had been spent on this Castle alone. On the whole, the average expenditure on this account during the ten years of Richard's reign was nearly in proportion to that which occurred in the time of his Father. Repairs or additions to the Castle, or the King's house therein, are charged, in the Sheriff's accounts, for the fodowing years, viz. 1200, 1201, 1202, 1203 (when Geoffry Fitz Piers ordered the outlay, he being both Chief Justice and Sheriff), 1204 (when the Castle well was repaired), 1205 (when Nicholas the Irishman and William Fitz William were Visors), 1206, 1207 (when the Tower of Brug, and four County gaols were repaired), 1209 (when four royal Castles were repaired), 1212 (when the work is specified to have been at \"the Barbican and drawbridge\"),36 and 4214 (when the charge is for the two preceding years) . Similar charges also occur on the Pipe Rolls of the. years 1218, 1219, 1220 (in each of which the outlay is stated at \u00a35. as if by special arrangement) , and 1221.

This expenditure wdl have been previous to Dec. 30, 1223, when the Earl's custody of the said Castles ceased. Another Record informs us that during his Shrievalty great waste was made in that part of Mors Forest called \" the wood of Worefield,\" one item whereof was the timber taken to Brug Castle.39 At Michaelmas, 1225, John Bonet (then Custos of the County) had paid \u00a314. 6s. 8c.. in the work of the Tower of Brug.

At Michaelmas, 1232, a simdar charge occurs; and in 1233, the Visors of some repairs at Brug had been Hamo le Palmer and Richard Fitz William. Michaelmas, 1240, the King's houses in Salop and Brug Castles had been repaired at a cost of 55s. In 1242, there is a charge for repairing the Castle walls ; another for the Castles of Brug and Salop in 1246; and in 1250 the Visors of repairs at the former were John de Castro and Nicholas Janitor. At Michaelmas, 1252, the large sum of \u00a3100. had been spent by the Sheriff, Robert de Grendon, in repairing the King's houses in the Castles of Salop and Brug, and in the erection of a new turret in the latter, under view and testimony of Nicholas Fitz Walter, Wdliam Bolding, and Richard Bocghan. At Michaelmas, 1254, Robert de Grendon's account states an outlay of \u00a322. 10s. as having been incurred since March, 1250, in repairs of the King's house in Brug Castle.

Further, that necessary repairs should be done to the windows of the Chapel in the Castle.

Its causes will better appear under another section of the History of Bridgnorth Castle. More than 250 years after the last- mentioned date, Bridgnorth was visited by John Leland, the Antiquary. Though not in chro nological sequence, his account49 of the Castle should be given here, as containing proximate hints as to the original site, dispo sition, and extent of this famous fortress. \" The Castle,\" he says, \" standeth on the south part of the towne, and is fortified by east with the profound Valley (of the Severn) instead of a ditch. The walles of it be of a great height. There were 2 or 3 stronge wardes in the Castle, that nowe goe totally to ruine. I count the Castle to be more in compasse then the third part of the towne \" (which he had before estimated as \" scant a mile in compasse\") . \"There is one mighty gate50 by north in it (the Castle), now stopped up, and a litle posteme made of force thereby through the wad to enter into the Castle. The Castle ground, and especiady the base court, hath now many dwellinge houses of tymbre in it newly erected.\" 48 Inquisitions, 9 Edw. I, No. 81. This Inquisition has been before alluded to (p. 205, note 39). It is described in the printed Calendar as \" concerning suits of Court to Brugg Castle ! \" In Mr. Dukes' Antiquities, 81 Commissioners are stated to have been employed on this occasion, by an error of punctuation, which con verts the office number of the Inquisition, into the number of Inquisitors. 50 The \" Mighty North Gate \" of Bridg north Castle, alluded to by Leland, was, I imagine, the same, which having been previously buried in other buildings was again exposed to view, during some street alterations in 1821. The fine Norman Arch and its unnecessary destruction are memorialized by the Historians of Shrews bury (vol. i, p. 54, note 3), in terms which both justify a reference to their note and plead against the future perpetration of such improvements, there or elsewhere. 49 Leland's Itinerary, vol. iv, part, ii, so. 182, a."], [320, "260 BRIDGNORTH. Having now given whatever evidence offered itself as to the fabric and extent of this Castle, during the early period of its ex istence, something remains to be said of its uses and occupancy as a Garrison, a Prison, and a Royal Residence. The Sheriff of the County was usuady an ex-officio keeper of the two Castles of Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury. The Constable, or chief resident officer in each, will ordinarily have been a deputy of the Sheriff. But we shall hear occasionally of the custody of the Castles and the County being intrusted to persons independent of each other; in which case the Constable of Bridgnorth was of course the immediate nominee of the Crown, The only other permanent officer who is mentioned was the Porter. The castellans, or regular garrison, in time of peace, were probably not more than five or six in number ; but in time of war, service of Castle-guard was due from some neighbouring tenants of the Crown. The earliest notice of the King's garrison here relates to the Porter. In and for the fiscal year ending Michaelmas, 1156,51 an annual charge arose upon the Crown revenue in Shropshire of 30s. 5c.. (or 1 penny per day) for Livery of the Porter of Brug. The Sheriff, William Fitz-Alan, charged it that year as a set-off to the ferm of the County, and the charge was continued by him and his successors in office, till the fourth year of King John (1202). In the sequel of John's reign this item of the Sheriff.:' expenditure is less regularly entered. The Porter and Warder (vigil) of Shrews bury Castle each received a simdar salary from the Crown, and through the Sheriff. In the fifth year of John (1203), only half of these appointed liveries seems to have been paid, and the pay ment to the Porter and Warder of Shrewsbury is apparently con fused with the payment to the Porter of Brug. From this period till Michaelmas, 1224 (8 Hen. Ill) inclusive, the latter salary (of 30s. 5<_.) whenever charged by the Sheriff, is entered as having been paid to the Porter and Warder of Brug ; but I attribute this to a perpetuation of the error observable in the account of 1203, and do not suppose that two officers were employed at Bridgnorth, but only at Salop. If, however, a Porter and Warder were employed at each Castle, the salary of the two at Bridgnorth was only half the salary of the two at Shrewsbury, which was uniformly \u00a33. 0s. lOrf. 51 Rot.

In the year ending Michaelmas, 1225, the Sheriff (John Bonet) again charged 30s. 5c.. for \" livery of the Porter and Warder of the Castle of Brug,\" but this item of charge was virtually canceded, because the then Constable of Bridgnorth was independent of the Sheriff and held his office at a fixed salary, out of which he was bound to pay his subalterns. The way in which this cancellation was effected is curious. The improper item is not underlined, as was usual in such cases, but the sum (30s. 5c..) is charged back upon the Sheriff in the sequel of the account, in these terms. \u2014 \" The same Sheriff owes 30s. 5 c.. for livery of the Porter and Warder of Bruges Castle, which he has taken credit for above, in the Corpus Comitatus?- which credit ought not to have been taken, because the Constable has a fixed stipend.\" In the following year the same Sheriff again charged 30s. 5c?. on this item, in that part of his account technically called the Corpus Comitatus ; but in this instance the entry is cancelled at once (i. e. underlined) and a note added to this effect : \u2014 \" It is cancelled before the Barons (of Ex chequer) because the Constables of the Castles have fixed stipends for custody of said Castles.\" This charge for the livery of the Porter was never again renewed on the annual Rolls, not even when custody of the Castle was held by the contemporary Sheriff. A matter of Exchequer routine has led us to digress from our proposed chronological account of Brug Castle. \u2014 We return to the year ending Michaelmas, 1163, when four hos tages had been maintained at Brug, and three at Salop. The Sheriff charges the Crown 61s. for the two items jointly. 62 That part of the Sheriff's annual account which went by this name may be described as follows. He first debits himself with the \" Firma Comitatus,\" or that revenue which he was presumed to receive as Fermor of the King's demesne, or other rights within the County. This revenue, in Shropshire, wets \u00a3265. 15.. per annum. at the foot of this section of account. H the Sheriff's receipts had been exceeded hy his authorized outlay, he credits him self with what he terms his \"surplus,\" and for which he is subsequently reim bursed. If, on the contrary, his receipts have exceeded his outlay and his payments into the Exchequer combined, he acknow ledges himself indebted pro tanto, and accounts for such debt, either in another section of the same year's Pipe Roll, or else at the head of the Roll of the year following, and under the title of \" the old ferm\" of the County for which he is Sheriff. The Sheriff then charges against this, his debt, whatever items of such ferm tho King had bestowed elsewhere, as well as all such occasional outlay as he himself had had warrant to make in the King's service. The balance, one way or other, is stated"], [322, "262 BRIDGNORTH. These hostages cannot but be associated with the events of the summer of 1163. In June, King Henry invaded South Wales, and having ravaged Caermarthenshire, Rees, Prince of South Wales, came to him at \" Pencadayr beside Brecknock, and did him homage and gave him pledges.\" Also on July 1, at Woodstock, the same Rees, with Owen Prince of North Wales, and Malcolm King of Scotland, did homage to the King and his son Henry.53 At Michaelmas, 1165, Guy le Strange, accounting, as Sheriff, for the quarter ending Christmas, 1164, charges \u00a34. Is. 3c?. for main tenance of twenty-five hostages at Brug : 54 and Geoffrey de Vere, his successor in office, charges \u00a34. 12s. for maintenance of the same number. These charges were clearly for one set of hostages, but at different periods. Taking the sums charged as our only means of calculation, it would appear that Geoffry de Vere's trust lasted rather more than a quarter of a year, i.e. till about Aprd, 1165. In 1164, the Princes of Wales had forsaken their fealty to King Henry, and in the summer of 1165, the King was again provoked to invade North Wales. A first expedition brought him to Ruth- Ian ; a second, in greater force, to the Berwyn. In both he seems to have been unsuccessful. The cruel and violent temper of Henry II, his various contempo rary mortifications, and certain historical parallels may lead us to attribute the disappearance of these hostages from the Sheriff's accounts to other causes than restoration to their country, a favour which indeed was at this very juncture most improbable. King John's cruelty to Welsh hostages is well and circumstantially established.55 No less established is my conviction that King John's cruelty and meanness were part of his paternal inheritance. The years 1173-4 are wed known as those of Prince Henry's rebellion against his Father. The Earls of Ferrers and Leicester taking an active part against the King, the Midland Counties may be presumed to have been much disturbed.

At Michaelmas, 1175, he charges \u00a313. 6s.

His account of Michaelmas, 1175, in the latter capacity left him still owing a sum of \u00a326. 13s. id. to the Crown. This also he had had the King's warrant for applying to the maintenance of the same 10 Knights, but his acquittance from the debt is not recorded till Michaelmas, 1176. In one of these years 1175-6, Bridgnorth will have been person ally visited by King Henry II. It was at the time when he made a progress throughout the kingdom, the ostensible object of which was the punishment of all those who, during the late troubles, had trespassed on the Royal Forests. Vast sums of money flowed into the Royal Treasury from the amercements which were thus imposed. Henry has been much blamed for this exercise of his restored power, but it should be remembered that in punishing trespassers of the Forest, he probably punished individuals whose general spirit of disloyalty had manifested itself in thus taking advantage of the disorganization of the period. His visit to Bridgnorth, at the time supposed, is proved by a Charter which was dated there, and by which the Priory of Wenlock came into possession of the Manor of Ditton. This Charter need Leicester.\" Leicester, the stronghold of its rebellious but then absent Earl, was invested by Reginald Earl of Cornwall and Richard de Luci, in the summer of 1173. It fell before the besiegers on July 22, and the Sheriff of Shropshire served in person on that occasion. He charges for liveries of serving-nien throughout the County of Salopser', while he himself \" was in the army of Leicester.\" 66 A charge of 4_. \" pro II manurnolis \" seemB also to belong to this list of stores. Manumola is interpreted by cirotheca (a glove) in the glossaries. A charge \"pro II mangonellis\" (catapults) would have been more intelligible. 57 Guy le Strange had in 1173 raised on behalf of the Crown a considerable contingent for what he describes, on his ac count of that year, as the \"army of 34"], [324, "264 BRIDGNORTH. not be here set forth, further than to say that it took effect from and after Christmas, 1175.58 It was attested by Richard de Luci, William Fitz Adeline (the Sewer), Reginald de Courtenay, William de Lanval, Robert Marmion, Saher de Quinci, Thomas Basset, Guy le Strange, William Fitz Ralph, and Randal Broc,59 who all may be presumed to have been of the Royal retinue \" at Bruges \" on this occasion. These witnesses' names afford ample corroboration of the date which the Exchequer accounts alone would fix for the grant, e.g. Richard de Luci (the great Justiciar) retired from court early in 1179. In 1176, Wdliam Fitz Adeline went as Viceroy to Ireland. William de Lanvall and Thomas Basset were associated Justiciars, who, in 1175, visited Worcestershire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. Further, on July 1, 1175, King Henry was at Woodstock; on August 1 at Nottingham. In the interval he had visited Lichfield, perhaps Bridgnorth also. In the months of December, 1197, and January, 1198, Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, Legate of the Apostolick See, and Chief Justice of the Realm, visited the Western Counties.60 His presence at Shrewsbury in January will be matter of future mention. It was on Christmas Day, 1197, that being at Hereford, he \" took in hand the Castle thereof, as wed as the Castles of Briges and Ludelaw, and expeding thence the Constables (Cus todes), who had long had custody of them, he delivered them to other Constables, to keep for the advantage of (or in behalf of) the King.\" 61 William Fitz Alan was at this time Sheriff of Shropshire. His account for the year ending Michaelmas, 1198, does not exhibit the slightest evidence of this interference of the Viceroy at Bridgnorth. He had obeyed writs of the Archbishop as well as of the King. He had repaired the Castle of Brug under the latter authority. He had paid the Porter of Brug his accustomed salary. Moreover he had paid \" 6s. 3d. in hire of the barge which carried the wife of Griffin, son of Rese (who was hostage for her husband), from Bruges to Gloucester.\"63 \u00bb Rot. Pip. 22 Hen.

He was at Feckenham (Worcestershire) on the 9th; at Brug on the 11th and 13th; and at Haywood (Staffordshire) on the 15th. With him were the Bishops of Coventry and Bangor, Geoffry Fitz Piers (Chief Justice of all England), and Simon Archdeacon of Wells (then one of the joint Keepers of the Great Seal).63 In March, 1204, King John was again at Bridgnorth. Having been at Lichfield on the 11th, he was here on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, and at Worcester on the 16th. With him was a noble retinue, such as none but a great fortress covdd have sufficed to accommo date. These were the Bishops of Lincoln and Hereford, the Earls of Essex (Geoffrey Fitz Piers, then Sheriff of the County), of Pem broke, Chester, Salisbury, Warren, Leicester, Warwick, and Here ford ; also William de Braose, the Provost of Beverley, Hugh de Nevill, and William Briwere.64 On this occasion Geoffrey Fitz Piers \" had paid \u00a340. to John de Torrue, the King's Clerk, who was to discharge therewith the King's expenses at Bruges.\" This item stands on Fitz Piers' Shropshire account, at the following Michaelmas, as a set-off against what was due from him on the ferm of the County.65 However the King's writ is extant, dated at Winchester, 7 May, 1204, whereby he orders his \"Treasurer and Chamberlains to dedver (liberate) to Geoffrey Fitz Piers \u00a340. which said Geoffrey had paid in the King's chamber, to discharge the King's expenses at Brug.\"66 We must presume that, instead of receiving the money ordered by the latter writ, Fitz Piers took a correspondent credit at the Exchequer, otherwise the Lord Chief Justice will have been repaid for his advance twice over. 22d March, 1205.

The latter had delivered Griffith to the English during a temporary pacification ; but when Gwenwynwyn again troubled the Border, theEnglish enlarged their prisoner and were aided by him as above stated.

The said livery is to be that which other two-horse Balisters have.67 On May 11, 1205, the Sheriff of Salop is ordered by the King to send without delay to Northampton ad the King's Balisters who are at Salop and Brug. They are to be at Northampton on Sunday before Pentecost, \" with their horses and accoutrements.\"68 This order was probably in anticipation of John's then contemplated expedition into Poitou, which, however, was afterwards (June 13) abandoned, though an embarkation at Portsmouth actuady took place. On Aug. 5, 1205, the King, being at Lambeth, sends to the Sheriff of Salop, Peter, a three-horse Balister, and nine two-horse Balisters, who are to receive 10s. id. per day (less than lid. each).

At the Forest Assizes, held at Salop, on Saturday after Mid-Lent, in the 10th year of King John (Sat. Mch. 14, 1209), the following curious case came before H. de Nevill and Peter de Leonibus, the presiding Justices.74 \"A certain stag entered into the bailey7i of the Castle of Bruges, through a postern, and the Castellans captured him and carried him to the Castle. And (the King's) Verderers, hearing thereof, came thither, and questioned Thomas de Erdinton, the then Sheriff, as to what he had done with the said stag : and he acknowledged that the matter was as alleged, and became bound that his men should appear before the Justices.\" He did not, however, keep his word, and some unexplained adjournment was the consequence. These Castellans are enumerated. They were \" Matthew the Constable, Roger de Fougeres, Richard de Bromwic, Robert the Porter, and Walleran, brother of Matthew.\" We thus learn the official connexion of the Sheriff with this Castle, his employment of a Deputy called Constable, and the insignificant force of the permanent garrison. We also may esti mate the stringency of those Forest Laws, whose inferior ministers could thus interrogate the Sheriff of two Counties, and a Royal favourite, about a stray stag.76 King John's third visit to Bridgnorth was in August, 1212. It was an eventful period of his reign, and one which has hitherto escaped any accurate historical notice. The rapidity of the King's movements would indeed be almost incredible were not the circum stances, which are now to be detailed, supported by the most unques tionable testimony.

The Spring saw Lewellyn associated with Gwenwynwyn Prince of Powis, Maelgon ap Rees of South Wales, and Meredith ap Robert of Cydewen.77 The Castles budt or garrisoned by the English fell one by one before their arms. The first notice which King John seems to have taken of this aidance, bears date, May 26th, at Wolmere (Hants), when he issued letters patent, confiscating all the lands of Mealgon ap Rese in the honor of Cardigan, and conferring them, with all services of the tenants, on Rese ap Griffin.75 Two months later, viz. on July 26th, the King was at Bristol. The only Castles of North Wales which now remained in his power were Ruthlan, Dyganwy, and Mathraval. The latter had been budt by Robert de Vipont, one of John's most active Lieutenants, on the banks of the Vyrnwy, about two miles above Meifod, and probably on the site of an older but long-forsaken Castle of the Princes of Powys. De Vipont was now besieged in this Castle by the Welsh confederates. Notwithstanding the digression, we will watch the dady move ments of King John at this crisis of his career. We shall observe him in his household, note him at the councd-board, trace him through the toilsome march of the summer day, admire his momentary energy though contrasted with irresolution and fear, wonder at the weak superstition which alternated with the most revolting crime. On Thursday, July 26th, the King passed from Bristol to Mel kesham (Wilts), and sent thence \u00a3300. to the Sheriff of Hereford shire, wherewith \" to succour Robert de Vipont who was besieged in Wales.\" 79 On Friday, July 27th, he was at Devizes and Lud garshall (both in Wdtshire), and on the 29th at Winchester. That day (it was Sunday) he passed back to Marlborough (Wdts); reached Tewkesbury on the 30th and was at Worcester on the 31st.

At Bridg north also remained certain coffers, which contained relics, and which seem to have travelled with the Court on all ordinary jour neys. Over these during the \" three nights which they remained at Brug\" were burnt wax candles at the King's expense.81 On the morning of Thursday, the 2d of August, the King ordered 60s. to be given to Buchard de Gratelou, a Knight, whose horse was in pawn at Brug and was thus redeemed. Urgent was the need of both horse and Knight, for on that same day King John raised the siege of Mathraval, in the heart of Powis land, and leveded its Castle with the ground. If we estimate this exploit according to the distance of the jour ney, the nature of the road, the season of the year, and the hazard of the work (for it is certain that the expedition was but slenderly attended),83 we shall recognise, even in King John, some of those capabilities which marked the Plantagenet, and which in him were kept in abeyance, probably by an almost unceasing consciousness of crime. The next day the King returned to Bridgnorth, transacting some matters of business as he passed through Shrewsbury, and, inter alia, writing to the Earl of Chester to support and protect Madoc ap Griffin and his men, to whom the King, now that Lewedyn had seceded from him, wished \" to recur as to his own son.\" 83 On reaching Bridgnorth the King ate twice, though it was Fri day, an offence which he atoned for the following day, by feeding a hundred paupers with bread, fish, and beer.84 He proceeded (on the 4th) to Russock (Worcestershire).

He also wrote to certain Lords and Knights of Flanders and Hainault, who had come to England at his mandate, beseeching them in the most affectionate terms to follow him, \" for that he could not come back to them, by reason of his army, which he had caused to be summoned.\" 87 This summons had been issued from Woodstock on the 20th and 21st of July. It was to various English Barons and Sheriffs, to meet him at Chester, coincidently with the time appointed to Lewellyn. At Salvata on the 12th, and Gunthorpe (Notts) on the 13th, the King reached Nottingham on the 14th, and remained there tdl the 22nd. Here a sudden change took place in his plans. On the 16th, he writes to ad Sheriffs who had obeyed his summons to Chester, commanding them to return to their provinces, and \" attend to their (provincial) business, for that at present he cannot come to Chester as he had proposed.\" \u2014 To his Earls and Barons there assembled he returns thanks for their attendance in such strength, and similarly dismisses them with their knights and retainers.

On the same 15th of May, the King writes to Henry de Erdinton, informing him that he has sent Philip de Albini, who will give his orders to Henry as details e.g., iie represents the King as going to Chester, dismissing his army in person, and then gohig to London, whereas, on leaving Nottingham, he went north wards to York and Durham. (p. 193) says that he hung Rees ap Maelgwn there. After the relief of Mathraval, De Vipont undertook custody of the four Castles of Oswestry, Chirk, Carrechova, and Eggelawe (Claus. 14 John, memb. 6 dorso), and we have already seen him employed at the first.

A similar letter from the King to the Constable of Bruges, enjoins his obedience to the orders of the same Philip.94 On the next day, the 16th, this plan was changed. The King addressing the Sheriff of Salop informs him that he sends into those quarters his faithful and beloved Robert de Courtenay and Walter de Verdun for the security and defence of those parts, and to take custody of Bruges Castle. The Sheriff (i. e. the deputy) is without delay to cause the said Castle with all its victuals and stores to be delivered to the same Robert and Walter, and he is to wait upon and aid their counsels, for the King's advantage and honour.95 A similar precept to the good men of Shrewsbury informs them of the new commission, and commands them so to join the Commis sioners in manful defence of their town and neighbourhood, as that the King may thank them. The same appointment isfarther certi fied to all Knights and free tenants in the Counties of Salop and Stafford.95 On the 23d of May, King John, addressing the Constable of Bruges, names Robert de Curtenay only, as his appointed Custos of the Castle, and orders dedvery thereof to the said Robert ; 96 but on July 5th fodowing, Robert de Curtenay and Walter de Verdun are enjoined to give up to the King's \" faithful and beloved \" Thomas de Erdinton the Castle of Bruges with its appurtenances and victuals, which they had received from the men of the said Thomas.97 On July 23, 1215, three hundred from Northampton to \" Bruges in \"V d pounds of wax were to be sent Wales,\" for the King's use.98 At the close of this month, King John made his fourth visit to w Rot.

Even had he discharged it, it was by no means equivalent to an appointment as Con stable. Eardinton's absence, and at a critical period. It was, in fact, in this very year, and while King John had his hands full elsewhere, that Lewellyn marched upon Shrewsbury and actually took the town. This circumstance, carefully concealed by the English Chroniclers, is given by Dr. Powell, and accepted by Mr. Blakeway (Sist. Shrewsbury, i, 92).

On the 2d he had passed to Worcester. With the King on this occasion were the Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishop of Coventry, the Earl Ferrars, Gilbert Fitz Reinfrid, William de Cantdupe, Brian de L'lsle, Hugh de Bernevall, and Richard de Mariscis, the Chancellor. An order about transfer of a Welsh hostage, and Charters to the Earl of Chester and the Borough of Droitwich, passed during the King's stay at Bridgnorth.99 On Nov. 21, 1215. The Sheriff (Thomas de Erdinton) is ordered to pay their liveries to the King's servants at Brug, and the King wid cause the Sheriff to be reimbursed according to view of the same servants.100 \u2014 King John was at this time besieging Rochester, which was held by Wddam D'Albini on the part of the Barons ; the whole king dom was in a ferment, and the business of the Exchequer totally suspended. \u2014 Hence this irregular order on the Sheriff of Shrop shire, and the absence of the usual form for entitling him to reim bursement.101 On the 2d of December, 1215, the King, still before Rochester, orders Thomas de Erdinton to give possession of certain lands (late held by Wrenie (Wrenoc) Wallensis, and seized into the King's hands), to \" Robert Teneray, our Constable of Bruges,\" to be held by him during pleasure.103 We have heard of Robert de Teneray before.103 We now see who he was, and that his office was distinct from that of the Sheriff, though perhaps subjective to it. Erdinton still had custody in chief, both of the Counties of Salop and Staf ford and of the Castle of Brug. On April 13, 1216, he is ordered to give up the two Counties and this Castle to the Earl of Chester, who is to be obeyed in the said Counties \" as an Earl, as a Sheriff, and as the King's Bailiff.\" 104 a cheque.

In August, 1216, King John made his fifth and final visit to Bridgnorth. Leaving Shrewsbury on the 14th, he occurs here the same day and the next. On the 16th he proceeded to Worcester, where he renewed his commission to the Earl of Chester, promising however to release the Earl, on the 8th of September following, from his shrievalty and its adjuncts.105 The writs, both Close and Patent, which issued during this visit to Bridgnorth, were numerous, but none of them were of immediate local interest, except his letters of protection to John, son of Peter Sarracen, whom we have men tioned before as then holding the Prebend of Walton, in the Collegiate Church of St. Mary Magdalene.106 John was at this moment hardly to be called King of England. London and the South-Eastern Counties had declared Prince Louis to be King. So had Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The King of Scots, John's vassal, had a week before marched through the kingdom of his Suzerain, done homage to Louis in London, and returned northwards without molestation.107 The Barons, includ ing the Earl of Salisbury, John's half-brother, were with the French Prince, who, in a contemporary document, sets forth his title to the Crown of England, which he claims to be his, both by inheritance and election.108 The sequel of John's career is wed known. \u2014 He survived his last visit to Shropshire little more than two months, when, exhausted by fatigue and anxiety, perhaps poisoned, he died at Newark. Those ties of loyalty which bound the Western Counties even to such a King as John Plantagenet were remembered by him to the last. By his own desire his remains were carried to Worcester, which he had quitted but two months before. There they still lie buried, and there the moralist may contrast the cold repose of a marble effigy with all other memories of him, whose life, whether from circumstance or disposition, was one continuous state of fever and unrest. In the fifth year of his reign, viz. in July, 1221, Bridgnorth was visited by young King Henry. On the 2d he passed hither from Shrewsbury, and on the 4th had proceeded to Kidderminster.109 Several writs of local interest issued during this visit, but which will be more properly cited elsewhere. 108 Rymer's F\u0153dera, i, 140. 109 Rot.

Dec. 30, 1223, the Earl of Chester is commanded to deliver the Castles of Salop and Bruges to Hugh Despencer,111 who apparently was appointed Sheriff of the Counties of Salop and Stafford at the same time.112 His tenure of either trust was very brief; for \u2014 On Feb. 2, 1224, he is ordered to deliver custody of the Castles to the Bishop of Worcester ; and the Earl of Salisbury accounted as Sheriff, for the nine months ending Michaelmas, 1224.113 When the Bishop of Worcester resigned the Castles to the Earl does not appear; but on Nov. 8, 1224, the King issues an order on the Treasury to pay the latter \u00a3106. 13s. id. in part of the annual salary of \u00a3200. which the King had assigned him for custody of the said Castles.114 The Earl, therefore, will have then held them at least half a year.

He held this office as nominee of the Crown, independently of the Sheriff, and at a fixed annual salary of 40 merks (\u00a326. 13s. id.), payable half-yearly, by Royal order on the Sheriff, or on the Exchequer.115 The usual allowance by the Crown of Id. per day to the Porter of Brug was now discontinued, as being part of the Constable's liabilities.

The Earl of Leicester had, on the other hand, quitted France and was again busy in reorganizing the Barons' party in England. On April 15, 1263, Prince Edward was at Shrewsbury for the purpose of repelling the aggressions of the Welsh and restoring order in the Marches. He writes thence to his Father. I cannot suppose that Shrewsbury Castle was at this time in the hands of any but a bond fide nominee of the Crown.169 On June 16, 1263, the King being then in London, undertakes to repay James d'Audley his outlay for victuading the Castles of Salop and Brug,170 from which it would appear that that Baron had sometime recovered the former from Ralph Basset. Immediately after this, the King was again obliged to submit to the Barons. A Patent dated at Westminster, 10 August, 1263, enjoins Roger de Somery to give up the custody of the Counties of Salop and Stafford to Hamo le Strange.171 It is probable that this appointment was in the nature of a compromise. De Somery was father-in-law of Ralph Basset, and though he and Hamo le Strange subsequently adhered to the Crown, they may both, at this period, be reckoned as favouring the Barons' party. A contemporary Chronicler dates Hamo le Strange's desertion of the Barons in 1263, and attributes it to corrupt motives.173 His adhesion to Prince Edward, in which he was joined by Ralph Basset and other Barons, was reduced to writing and confirmed by oath of the Declarants. The document bears date at Lambeth, August 18, 1263, and implies no corrupt sacrifice of principle whatever.173 On Oct. 8, 1263, the King, then at Dover, grants to Hamo le Strange and others pardon for all transgressions which they had committed in relation to the \"statutes of Oxford\"174 (the enact ments of 1258), and \u2014 On Nov. 22, 1263, the King, at Windsor, appoints the same Hamo to the custody of the Castles of Salop, Brug, and Mont gomery.176 In December, 1263, reference of the disputes which had so long 109 Rymer's F\u0153dera, i, 425. 172 Contin.

Among the friends of Henry, and who undertook that he should abide by Louis' decision, were John Fitz-Alan, Roger de Mortimer, James d'Audley, Alan la Zuche, Roger de Clifford, Hamo le Strange, Roger de Somery, and Roger de Leyburne. Peter de Montfort's name appears among those who simdarly obliged themselves on the part of the Barons. Louis' award, wholly in favour of King Henry, bears date January 23, 1264.170 On hearing this intelligence, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and his party, flew into open rebellion. Two of the Chroniclers give us a somewhat inconsistent account of their proceedings. \u2014 One of these (probably a Monk of Worcester) records, under the year 1263, that several Barons, among whom were Peter de Montfort (our former Sheriff) and Robert de Montfort, son of Earl Simon, attacked and stormed Worcester.177 The day given for this capture of the \" Loyal City \" is the 2nd of the kalends of March, which (after looking to the context of the passage quoted, and the writer's mode of dating) will be equivalent to Feb. 29, 1264. The Continuator of Matthew Paris states, under the year 1261, that Earl Simon himself and the army of the Barons, after taking Gloucester Castle, marched to Worcester, Brug (Burgiam), or else Salop (sive Salopiam), and, easily taking and occupying them all, went southwards and subdued the Isle of Ely.178 The result of the battle of Lewes (May 14, 1264) is well known, and how the King became Montfort's prisoner for more than a year, and yet the ostensible authority for all the Usurper's acts of govern ment.

First comes a Patent bearing date June 4, 1264, which appoints, in 29 Counties, certain officers entitled \" Keepers of the Peace.\" 179 The one appointed for Salop and Stafford was Ralph Basset of Drayton. In no case is the Sheriff of the County addressed as to any of these appointments, but the Nominee himself, who was probably expected to supply the place and usurp the functions of the lawful Sheriff. The Custos of each County was to return four Members (knights) to the Pardament which was to meet at London on June 22 following. These Knights were to be elected \"by assent of each County.\" Shropshire made known its sentiments on this occasion by returning four members, who were pronounced \" to be unfit, by Peter de Montfort.\" The Parliament, in fact, never met, probably because a majority of its members were simi larly disqualified. A Patent dated at Canterbury, 24 August, enjoins Hamo le Strange to give up the Castles of Salop and Bruges, and the town of Bruges, to whomsoever the King shall appoint by his Letters Patent. The same Hamo, with James de Audley, Roger de Mor timer, Roger de Clifford, and Roger de Leyburne, are also required to deliver up their prisoners, taken at Northampton (those rebels whom the King before his captivity had surprised in Northampton Castle).180 On Dec. 20, Hamo le Strange is again required to give custody of the Castles of Salop and Bruges to Ralph Basset of Drayton.181 On Jan. 2, 1265, Hamo le Strange and his fellow royalists are invited to retire to Ireland, and stay there for a season. Safe con duct for themselves and families is graciously vouchsafed, as also protection for their lands, men, and goods.182 \u2014 Whether any of them actually went, is a question. Roger de Mortimer's term for setting out was extended by Patents dated February 5, March 2, and April 8, following.183 Meanwhile, on February 3, custody of the Counties of Salop and Stafford had been committed to Robert de Grendon, who on 179 Rot.

They are to publish the accord which had been concluded between the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester ; \" and whereas Roger de Clifford, Roger de Leyburn, Hamo le Strange, and others, their fellow marchers, who ought, according to the Provisions of Worcester, to have left the kingdom, have delayed to do so, in con tempt of the King, it is ordered that the said Custos and Sheriffs do arrest them and their abettors, if they busy themselves in averting the minds of faithful subjects from the King, so as to disturb the peace.\" Letters on the same matters were directed to the Badiffs and to the \" good men \" of the King, and to the community, both of Shrewsbury and Brug.186 I have not the least doubt that Hamo le Strange had kept posses sion of Bridgnorth Castle through the whole period, \u2014 from his first appointment to that custody in November, 1263, until now; and this Patent is not the only evidence that the men of the Borough shared in the same sagacious loyalty. The Burgesses of Shrewsbury too were hearty Royalists, and early assumed the offensive against Montfort's nominee. A Patent dated at Monmouth, June 25, 1265, commands the Abbot of Shrewsbury to enjoin the Bailiffs of that town, on the King's behalf, that they give up to Ralph Basset, \" Keeper of the Peace,\" certain men of the said Ralph's, whom the said Bailiffs detain.187 184 Pat. ibidem.

Montfort's position was now getting critical. A further Patent, dated at Monmouth, three days later, distinguishing Prince Edward, the Earl of Gloucester, John de Warren, Wdliam de Valence, Roger de Mortimer, and James d'Audley, as rebels, says, that they are making hostile occupation of Castles and Towns throughout the kingdom, and desires Simon de Montfort, junior, and other Keepers of the Peace to oppose and injure them in every possible way.188 The prospects and position of these \" rebels \" continued never theless to improve during the whole succeeding month of July. On the 1st of August, young Simon de Montfort suffered a surprise and some loss at their hands, and remained shut up in his Father's Castle of Kenilworth. The sequel of the 4th is well known ; how the morning twilight greeted the waiting crest of Prince Edward on the upland field of Evesham, whilst the adjacent roads were occu pied by the contingents of Mortimer and De Clare; how the evening of that day saw the corpse of Montfort slain and dis honoured. \u2014 A life of consummate selfishness and hypocrisy was not to be atoned for, even by the noble heroism displayed at its close.189 On the restoration, and till Michaelmas, 1267, when the Pipe Rolls recommence, Hamo le Strange appears to have been the recog nized Sheriff of the Counties and Keeper of the Castles. He also received other and more substantial marks of Royal favour.190 In September, 1267, the County was favoured by a Royal visit. The preparations at Bridgnorth Castle for the reception of both King and Queen have already been noticed. About this time also Walter de Hopton succeeded to the shrievalty, and was allowed in tbe following year (53 Hen. Ill) a sum of \u00a330. 8*. 4s?., which he had paid for corn, oats, oxen, and sheep, supplied on the occasion of the King's late visit.191 His custody of the Castle of Brug at the same time has already been shown.

On the one hand, he appears as a traitor and insatiably greedy; on the other, as a saint and martyr.

On the death of Hugh de Mortimer, in January, 1273, his successor, Ralph de Mortimer, was appointed to his offices, both as Constable and Sheriff.193 We may conclude this account of Bridgnorth Castle with a few statements, which were made on Nov. 29, 1274, before the King's Commission of inquiry and by the Jurors of the Borough.193 In answer to a question, as to \" how many and what demesne Manors the King held in hand,\" they said that he so held, in hand, and in demesne, the Castle of Brug. \u2014 In reply to an inquiry as to the excesses of public Officers, they stated that \" Robert Trillec,194 Receiver (for the Sheriff) caused the Burgesses and Bailiffs of Brug to come before him in the Castle ; the Bailiffs he detained, and, without the King's mandate, imprisoned (against justice and the King's peace, and the liberties of Brug) , till a certain woman who was then confined in the gaol of the Borough Liberty was transferred to his custody in the gaol of the Castle, \u2014 and all this against the franchise granted to the said town by Kings of England.\" They also stated, that \" the same Robert had maintained and was still maintaining certain guards (Satellites), who wrongfully extorted money from messengers and other travellers on the King's highway : but the amount of their demands the Jurors knew not.\" \" The same Robert had caused these guards to seize Richard de Dode monston at midnight, and carry him about from one wood to another, threatening his life; which Richard offered a fine of 3 merks payable to Trillec, if he might be taken to the Castle- Prison of Brug with his head on his shoulders (sine decolacone,196 i. e. decollatione), which fine he also paid.\" 192 Blakeway MSS. in Bibl. Bodl., ap- parently quoting a Patent. The succes- sion of the Sheriffs themselves at this period is very uncertain. As the matter receives no light in connexion with Bridg- north Castle, I willingly postpone its con- sideration. I may, however, state that all existing lists of our Sheriffs in the thirteenth century are so inaccurate, that the subject must necessarily recur to our notice. 193 Rot. Hund. ii, 88. 194 There is complex confusion about this Robert Trillec and his Office. In this passage he is printed as \"Robertus Trillec, deceptor,\" instead of \" Receptor \" (Receiver of the County), and Mr. Blake way makes him Sheriff \" in the latter end of Henry III or beginning of Edward I\" (Sheriffs, p. 7). His office is, however, very ascertainable, and its period. He was Under-Sheriff to, Clerk or Attorney of, or Receiver for, Ralph de Mortimer, who entered upon office as Sheriff Jan. 23, 1273. In that capacity Trillee will have had authority over the Constables and Castles of Salop and Bridgnorth. 195 ii^g WOrd is read \" desolatione \" (Sheriffs, p. 8, note 1), and of course un translated. 37"], [348, "288 BRIDGNORTH. \" The same Robert Tridec, Under- Sheriff of Salop, concealed the felony of Robert Coly (or Soly), a felon, attached for theft, and imprisoned in the Castle gaol, and released him without the King's mandate and without trial, and has him yet with him.\" \" Also, when said Trillec caused Richard de Dodemonston and Philip his brother to be arrested and imprisoned in Brug Castle, their friends obtained a mandate of the King for delivery of the gaol of Brug,196 which mandate Trillec would not obey, tdl the prisoners made fine of 20 merks, receivable by him, for enlarging them under bail.\" Also the Jurors said that \" when Reginald de Cnolle had arrested a woman for theft, and taken her to be imprisoned in the Castle, and presented her to Hugh de Donvile, the Constable, for that purpose, the said Hugh would not receive her for imprisonment, till Reginald had fined 2 merks, receivable by Hugh, and which he paid him.\" The last extract gives us the name of a Constable of Brug, distinct from any Sheriff or Under- Sheriff of the County, though probably subject to both. A few other such Constables have occurred above, such as Matthew in 1209, and Robert de Teneray in 1215. Before we dismiss the subject we will refer back a dttle for the names of one or two more such Officers, mention of whom in chronological sequence would have interrupted the connexion of more important matters. In 1259 and 1262, Walter de Winterton was Constable of Brug. On Nov. 29, 1259, he joined with others in taking one of the King's deer. Not appearing to answer for this offence at the Forest Assizes of February, 1262, the Sheriff had orders accordingly.197 The next Constable who occurs was Wdliam de Wystaneston, who joined William le Enfant, then Badiff of Stottesden Hundred, in imprisoning and extorting money from Wdliam de Hempton.198 Widiam le Enfant himself, having been Badiff both of the Hun dreds of Munslow and Stottesden, was also sometime Constable of Brug. He held the latter office during the shrievalty of Walter de Hopton (1267-8). His injurious and extortionate conduct was reported, six years afterwards, both by the Jurors of Norley Regis and Stottesden.199 The latter also accused him of keeping a certain 196 Not for the \" release of the prison- ers \u00bb (as Sheriffs, p. 8). 197 Plac.

This was at instigation of John de Bersempton, then Badiff of Stottesden, who coveted some land of Roger's, which the latter was thus forced to sell. The succeeding Constable, Hugh de Donvile, was also Bailiff of Stottesden. He held one or both offices in 1272 and 1273, and the two in conjunction in 1274. The power which he thus obtained made him the subject of numerous complaints at the Inquests of November, 1274. His excesses were not only reported by the Jurors of Bridgnorth, as before particularized, but by those of Ludlow, Munslow, Nordley Regis, Overs, and Stottesden.201 His assistants or servants are also named, viz. Hugh Bron, Thos. de Midlehope, and Geoffrey his brother. Donvde also kept an Approver in the Castle Prison, \" who impeached many faithful subjects and harmless men for the sake of lucre.\" Nor did he only oppress the innocent ; for he allowed the gudcy to escape. By his connivance an outlaw named Henry le Pleidour, whom Donvile had arrested in Shropshire, got off by giving a false name when arraigned before the Justices for delivery of the gaol of Brug. Calling himself John de Womburne, the criminal appealed to a Staffordshire Jury, which, knowing nothing of him, acquitted him. The Stottesden Jurors, who reported this, could not say what money Donvde got for his connivance in the job. About the year 1280, Hugh de Dodemonston was Constable of Bridgnorth, Roger Sprenghose being also Sheriff of the County, Thomas de Marham, Badiff of Stottesden Hundred, and Nicholas le Porter, Gatekeeper of the Castle.202 \u2014 At the Assizes of 129.2, it appeared that the three subordinates, viz. the Constable, the Bailiff, and the Porter, had been suspected of letting a prisoner escape from the Castle. The first (Hugh de Dudmaston) was now tried and acquitted ; Thomas de Marham, of whom we have heard before,203 had died in prison; the Porter, Nicholas, had absconded (non est inventus) . seems to have been that the defendant had either to fight a duel with his accuser or else bribe the said accuser's employers. 200 The Approver (or Probator) was a most formidable instrument of feudal oppression.

The Borough of Bridgnorth is presumed to have been a founda tion immediately consequent on the transfer of the Castle from Quatford, in 1101. Ordericus indeed, describing Earl Robert's proceedings, says expressly that he transferred the Town.204 We shall presently see that King Henry I recognized the new Borough, and adowed it certain privileges ; but whether these were defined by Charter or left to be established by prescription, we have no means of judging.205 The confirmation of these privdeges by King Henry II is extant, and, as being the earliest written Charter implying Royal recognition of any Shropshire Borough, deserves special attention.206 Its pur port is as follows : \u2014 \" Henry, King of England, and Duke of Normandy and Aqui taine and Earl of Anjou, to his Justiciars and Sheriffs and Barons and Ministers and all his faithful of England, greeting.

The original is not known to exist, but its substance is embodied in an ample Inspeximus of Bridgnorth Charters by James I. A duly vouched copy of this Inspeximus is among the Muniments of the Corporation, and is my authority for all the Charters I shall quote, except that of King Johu. 206 Shrewsbury was a much older Borough than Bridgnorth, but it has"], [351, "BRIDGNORTH. 291 King Henry II did not date his Charters, but the period of his reign, if not the very year (1157) in which this one passed, can be ascertained by a redundancy of evidence. E. G. No deed of Henry II, passing in England, can have been attested by \" T. Cane.\" (Thomas the Chancellor) except in the year 1155, or else between Aprd, 1157, and August, 1158. \u2014 Precisely the same limits may be assigned to all English deeds attested for Henry II by the two other witnesses; for the King was absent from England during all other periods at which Henry de Essex was in favour or Wdliam Fitz Alan alive. The King, in fact, was in Normandy from Christmas, 1155, till April, 1157, and again from August, 1158, till December, 1162. At the latter period, and on Henry's return to England, Becket was no longer Chancedor, Fitz Alan was dead, and the disgrace of Henry de Essex imminent. \u2014 Of the three years (1155, 1157, and 1158) which remain at our choice, the second (1157) is the most probable for the date of this Charter. The unsettled state of Bridgnorth during, and consequent upon, Mortimer's rebellion, puts the early part of the year 1155 out of question, and renders the latter part improbable. \u2014 It was in autumn of 1157 that Henry de Essex is said to have disgraced his office of Constable at Counsylth. His actual forfeiture did not take place for several years, but his immediate loss of Court favour is evident from the Pipe Rolls. When we add to these con siderations the fact that the Sheriff of Staffordshire charges, in 1158, for fencing the King's house and garden at Radmore,308 and when we find another Charter of Henry II expedited there, and which, on independent grounds, we should date in 1 157-8,209 enough will have been said to warrant the conclusion that his Confirmation to the Borough of Brug passed about 1 157. When, in the fiscal year ending Michaelmas, 1159, the Barons, Knights, Abbots, and Burgesses of the kingdom had contributed a royal aid in form of a donum, the only Boroughs in Shropshire 299 Monasticon, iv, 111, in. -08 Rot.

They had respectively raised the sums of 50 and 10 merks, and paid the same, through the Sheriff, at the Exchequer.210 Again, at Michaelmas, 1160, the Boroughs of Shrewsbury, Brug, and Newport had been assessed to a donum, in sums of 40 12, and, I1, merks respectively. Each had then paid half its quota, and the balances were discharged by each in the year following.211 At this period, the ferm of the County, for which the Sheriff was annually responsible at the Exchequer, stood at \u00a3265. 15s. Of this sum, the said Sheriff was accounted to receive _\u00a320. from the Borough of Shrewsbury, and \u00a35. from the Borough of Bridgnorth. These amounts he paid over to the Crown, and whatever he could get more on each item was his own. \" The yearly Ferme of towns,\" says Madox,213 \" arose out of certain locata or demised things that yielded issues or profit. Insomuch that when a town was committed to a Sherif, Fermer, or Custos, such Fermer or Custos wed knew how to raise the ferme out of the ordinary issues of the town, with an overplus of profit to himself.\" (A source of yearly revenue which, in the year 1167, arose to the Crown out of the Borough of Brug, independently of the annual ferm, will be noticed hereafter. At present, we pursue the history of that revenue which is technically caded the \" firma Burgi.\") We have arrived nearly at the period when this town obtained the great end and aim of all municipal bodies, the privdege of paying its own ferm or chief-rent to the Crown, and so escaping the arbitrary extortions of any Sheriff or other intermediate officer. At Michaelmas, 1170, the Burgesses of Brug and of Salop had fined with the Crown in sums of 20 and 18 merks respectively, \" for having the ferms of their vills.

At Michaelmas, 1171, however, the Burgesses of Brug account themselves for \u00a31. 13s. id., the \"increment of their vill.\" They had paid it into the treasury, and were quit?15 At the same time it is quite clear that the Sheriff continued to receive the old /<?.\u00bb. of \u00a35. per annum, and perhaps no more. \u2014 At all events he accounted so much to the Exchequer in his general ferm of the County. This complex mode of accounting for the ferm of the Borough continued for four years longer, viz. 1172, 1173, 1174, and 1175; the Burgesses paying their annual increment, and that part of the Sheriff's account, which was termed the Corpus Comitatus, exhibiting no reference to the new arrangement.316 But during the last of these fiscal years, the Burgesses had again fined in a sum of 30 merks and two coursers \"to have their town at ferm.\" \u2014 And the full effect of this second fine becomes both apparent and intelligible on the Pipe Roll of the following year (ending Michael mas, 1176).317 Then, the Sheriff, being no longer in receipt of '\u00a35. per annum (the quota of this Borough towards the ferm of the County), discharges himself of the responsibility, taking credit for the said .\u20ac5.

The King also begins, at this juncture, to issue writs to the Burgesses, which are in the nature of drafts on their annual debt. In this very year he directed them to make a payment \" in corrody of his sister, the wife of David ap Owen.\"218 And this draft the Burgesses duly respected : they made the said payment, and took credit, to the value, in their own account with the Ex chequer. Another and permanent payment which the King ordered them to make was 10.. per annum, the tithe due from the Crown, to the Canons of St. Mary Magdalene. This, hitherto an item in the Sheriff's disbursements, was henceforth settled by the Burgesses. At Michaelmas, 1177, the Sheriff again acquits himself of ad concern in the \u00a35. above mentioned,219 and this exemption is either directly entered or substantively reckoned in every Sheriff's account for the next century.230 With regard to the \" fine of 30 merks and 2 coursers,\" by which the Burgesses obtained their full privilege, they discharged it as follows: \u2014 BeforeiMichaelmas, 1176, they had paid \u00a33. 18s. id. in further \"corrody of the King's sister:\" before Michaelmas, 1177, they had accounted \u00a316. 1*. 8d. into the Treasury; and within another year they had delivered two Coursers to the King himself, and were quit?n Their annual ferm of 10 merks (\u00a36. 13s. id.), less 10s. paid to the Canons, continues on the Pipe-Rolls of the next century, and with no variation, except when the King or Chief Justice gave a casual order or cheque on this revenue, \u2014 of which more in its proper place. 218 David ap Owen, Prince of North Wales, had married Emma, sister of King Henry II, in 1174.

TALLAGES. Besides this annual contribution to the royal revenue, the Borough of Bridgnorth, like ad other demesnes223 of the Crown, was assessed to occasional contributions of a different kind. We have already seen such impost levied under the name of a donum. At Michael mas, 1174, it is entered as an \" Assize made throughout the King's demesnes in Salopescire by the Sheriff, under writ of Richard de Luci.\" On this occasion Shrewsbury was assessed at \u00a340, Brug at \u00a310, and Newport, Worfield, Claverlcy, Ford &c. in less sums.333 At Michaelmas, 1177, the tax goes under the name of \"the aid (auxilium) of the Boroughs and Vdls of Salopescr' (assessed) by Ralph Fitz Stephen\" and other justiciars. To this Shrewsbury and Brug contributed 20 merks each.324 At Michaelmas, 1 1 87, the impost recurs under the title of \" A Tadage of the King's demesnes and of lands which were then in his hand;\" but each item is said to be \"de dono.\"225 Thus the Bur gesses of Salop render account of \u00a343. 13.. id. \"de dono\" on this occasion; those of Brug are assessed at 15 merks, the men of Ludlow at 20 merks. Half of their quota had been paid by the Burgesses of Brug; the other half, for some cause or other, remained a debt tid the year 1190-1, when it appears that the King (Richard I) had excused it. In 6 Rich. I (1194-5), the Tallage of Salop was \u00a326. 13s. id., of Brug \u00a35.226 In 1199, two Tallages are entered as due.

The word \" Tallage,\" is simply equivalent to \" Taxation,\" but it seems to have been set or assessed on Boroughs and Manors by Justiciars, who were to form their own estimate as to the capability of each con tributing body, whilst, in the case of Scutage, one rule obtained throughout the Kingdom. 226 Rot.

Ill (1223), when Shrewsbury had been assessed at 100 merks, Brug only at 10 merks.231 In 1227, the King's demesnes in Shropshire were again assessed to a Tallage, in what sums we know not ; but on April 5th, the King's writ issued to Henry de Audley and John Bonet, informing them that he had excused the assessment made on the town of Brug, except 50 merks.233 Accordingly a memorandum to that effect is entered on the Originalia Rolls of that year,233 and the She riff, John Bonet, accounting for Henry de Audley at Michaelmas following, enters 50 merks as the Tadage of Brug.234 Thirty merks of this debt was unpaid in 1229; and in 1230, the Town of Brug was again assessed, by Henry de Audley and William Basset, to a new Tallage of 25 merks, Shrewsbury being rated at 70 merks.235 The Tallage of 1235 exhibits Shrewsbury assessed at 100 merks, Brug at 25 : that of 1242 shows the same Boroughs paying 40 and 20 merks respectively. Again, in 1246, they pay 60 and 50 merks to a Tallage. In 1249, they were again talliated; and in 1252 Shrewsbury paid 120 merks to a Tallage assessed by William de Axmouth, while Brug was only rated at 50.

At Michaelmas, 1180, the great Justiciar, Ranulf de Glanvdl, having visited this County, left the Burgesses of Brug subject to the heavy amercement of 20 merks. Their offence was \" quia quandam loquelam dixerint concordatam qu\u00e6 non erat\" (because they had reported a suit as compounded which was not compounded) .237 Of this fine they had already paid half, and they discharged the balance in 1181 and 1182, when the debt is entered on the Pipe Rolls as being \" pro falso dicto\" (for a false averment) .337 These particulars, apparently insignificant in themselves, have yet their further meaning. \u2014 The Burgesses are amerced corporately ; their Town was therefore already corporate. \u2014 They were amerced for a dictum or return which could only have been made in their Borough Court : they therefore had such a Court. \u2014 And this Court took primary cognizance of certain legal matters which were above and beyond the usual routine of self-government : they therefore had special privileges. At Michaelmas, 1183, the Sheriff accounts 5 merks which the Burgesses had fined with the Justices recently in eyre, in exchange. or recompence, of certain assarts of the said Burgesses' making.338 They had, in fact, put into cultivation, or use, some waste land, which was so far deemed to be of the King's demesne as that it could not be occupied without license. At Michaelmas, 1190, the Borough account of its ferm is cre dited with 2 merks. They had paid so much \" under order of the Chancellor (Longchamp) to Osbert Luvell, the Huntsman, to buy him a horse.\"339 The earliest County Assizes of which we have detaded record were those of October, 1203. On these occasions every Hundred or Borough having an exclusive jurisdiction was summoned to send its Jury. In this instance the Borough of Brug was so represented. It is entered on the Assize Roll as the Hundred of Brug, which merely impdes that, at the time, it was independent of any other Hundred, 236 Ibidem. 237 Rot. Pip. 26 Hen.

The only matter of local concern, which the Jury of 1203 reported, was that the \"Assize of Cloth was not held in the Borough.\"240 The Assize of Cloth was an ancient statute regulating the measure and price of such manu factures. Its non-observance in any Borough subjected the com munity to a fine; and 4 merks were exacted in this instance. From the number of Towns both in Shropshire and Staffordshire which were fined for the same offence on this circuit, we may conclude that the matter was made one of general inquiry by the Justiciars, not that the Juries volunteered these statements to the discredit of their own communities. The Stottesden Jury at these same Assizes reported that John the Vintner of Brag had sold wine \" against the Assize.\" His offence and that of Roger Rotarius, another vintner of Brug, resulted in fines of 6s. 8d. charged on each individual, not on the community.241 15 June, 1212. The Provosts and men of Brug are ordered to' provide 10 of their fittest citizens with horses and arms, to be ready to accompany the King in his transfretation on receipt of further orders.342 These orders never came, for the King gave up his foreign expedition. In this reign a second Royal Charter was obtained for the Borough.243 It bears date at the New Temple, London, January 10, 1215, and is as follows: \"John by the Grace of God, &c. Know ye that we have conceded and by this our Charter confirmed to our Burgesses of Bruges, in Salopesire, that they may go and come through our whole land of England and transact all manner of merchandise ; buying and selling and negotiating ; freely, quietly, well, and in peace ; in fairs and markets, in Cities and Boroughs and all places ; and that they be free and quit of toll and passage, for all their merchandise, wherever they may pass throughout our land of England, saving to our City of London its franchises. Wherefore we will and strictly enjoin that the said Burgesses and their heirs may have and hold of us and our heirs all the said liberties and free customs, &c.

They were forthwith sued by the latter, and an order244 of King John dated 26 April, 1215, appoints the men of Salop \"to appear before the King in one month of the close of Easter to answer the Burgesses of Bruges \" as to the hindrances which had been offered to the latter in opposition of their chartered franchises. On the day appointed (May 24) King Joint was at Reading, but I can trace nothing of the issue of the suit on this occasion. About the same time the Burgesses of Brug began to fortify their town with a wooden rampart, a precaution doubtless suggested by the troubles of the period. A report on the state of the Royal Forests 'drawn up in the year 1235 records that whde Ranulf Earl of Chester was Sheriff (that is between the years 1216 and 1223), and before the town was encompassed with a wall, large allowances of timber were made out of Mors Forest towards its enclosure.245 Among some old debts due to the Crown, and entered on the Pipe-Roll of the second year of Henry III, one of 30 merks is charged on the men of Brug \" for having the King's Charter about their franchises.\"246 The Charter alluded to was clearly that of King John above recited, and the debt was now discharged by instal ments. At Michaelmas, 1220, one-half, viz. \u00a310, was still due.247 On May 10, 1220, King Henry III, being at Worcester, orders the Sheriff of Salop to aid the Burgesses of Bruges in the enclo sure of their town, allowing them out of the Royal Forest near Bruges as much of old stumps and dead timber as would suffice to make two stacks (rogos) . This was to be done with as little injury as possible to the Forest, and Hugh de Upton and Roger de Bechesor (Badger) were to be Visors on the occasion.248 The King at the same time granted a further license to enable the Burgesses to complete their defences.

Other tolls were also specified, on pack-horses, cattle, and barges ; and the whole license may be taken as an early instance of those Royal Grants to take \" customs\" or \" murage \" which we shall notice more summardy in the sequel.349 On June 26, 1220, the King made another grant of timber to the Borough. The quantity allowed was to be the same as before, but old oaks are substituted for dead wood. It was to be taken from Mors Forest and under view of the King's \" faithful\" Hugh de Beckbury and Richard de Ruton (Ry ton) whom he had commanded, by letters, to attend to the matter. They were to make tally of the number of oaks so taken.250 At the Shrewsbury Assizes, November, 1221, a Jury attended to represent \" the Vdlate of Bruges together with the Hundred,\" by which is simply meant the Borough and its Liberties. Among \" Pleas of the Crown \" with which they had concern, they reported one, wherein Andrew Fitz Wdliam, having challenged Wdliam de Ingwardine for robbery, was dead. The Jurors moreover said, that by judgment of the County Court, the parties had been bound over to fight a duel in the case. The Justices hereupon caused reference to be made to the County Court, which recorded that such a chal lenge had been made as the Jurors alleged, and that, whereas the challenge involved mention of the King's Peace, they (the County Court) had attached the parties to come before the Justices in eyre, but that they had bound them over to no wager of battle. On receiving this memorial the Justices found the Brug Jurors to be in misericordid?sl The above extract shows the inferiority of the Hundredal or Borough Jurisdictions to that of the Great Court of the County and the reference which each was obliged to make, in certain cases, to the King's Justices. At these same Assizes, the Jurors of Brug reported a murder in their district, and a case of accidental drowning ; also that Henry Bacun and John the Vintner had \" sold wine against the Assize.\"252 251 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

They further gave information of two cases of purpresture on the King's demense in Brug, for which fines were inflicted. One of these, by Henry Dod, was the erection of a lodge close to the Castle Gate. This, though punishable as a purpresture, the Jury did not consider injurious; nay, they recommended that the lodge be allowed to stand as a defence of the Castle Gate, \u2014 which the Court sanctioned. But a fence which Geoffrey Aunketill had made was both punishable by fine and, being injurious to the vill, was ordered to be taken down. The Sheriff had instructions accordingly. Both the fines were excused on account of the poverty of the parties. Under the head of \" New Customs\" the Jurors reported that the Sheriff's Bailiffs called upon the Burgesses to make trace (pursuit, hue and cry) through their town, and that this they could not do, and that Robert de Shineford had lately fined them 40 shillings for an omission of this kind. On this matter the Court reserved its judgment. The Jurors lastly made complaint, on behalf of their Burgesses, against those of Shrewsbury, who would not allow them to purchase raw hides or undressed cloth in the latter town, as they had been used to do.253 In November, 1222, the Borough of Brug was among those whose Bailiffs were addressed on the subject of the aid granted, by the King in Councd, for the King of Jerusalem.254 The clause of the enactment which affected Cities and Boroughs was that every person possessed of chattels to the value of half a merk should con tribute 1 penny. This is the first positive recognition which has occurred of the Bailiffs, or Provosts, of the Town ; and we learn hence that its or earlier. A year later (Feb. 1223) it was generally limited by the King in Council to sixpence the Sextary (or Quart), but this rule was relaxed for many towns, and a price of 8d. or 10_. allowed.

Mich. Tm. 7 and 8 Hen. Ill, memb. 24 recto). The local importance of this branch of trade is further shown by the Salopians having a few years later (March, 1227), procured a Royal Charter which empowered them to refuse traffic in these commodities, to any who were not in lott and acott at Shrewsbury (Sistory of Shrewsbury, vol. i, p. 102). 853 This matter ended in a law-suit be tween the Boroughs, if indeed such a suit had not been commenced already and in the previous reign. On the Quinzaine of St. Martin (Nov. 25), 1223, at Westmin ster, a Jury having been empanelled to try \" whether the Burgesses of Brug, from the 9th year of King John to the 5th of Henry, had enjoyed a liberty of purchasing 234 Claus, i, 568."], [364, "302 BRIDGNORTH. municipal constitution was fixed at an earlier period than that at which existent Charters would per se give us information as to the personnel of the governing body. On March 26, 1223, the King's writ to the Bailiffs of Bristol informs them, that he learns from his Father's Charter the immunity from ad toll and custom pertaining to the Crown, which the Bur gesses of Bruges ought to enjoy, throughout all the land and at the sea-ports. The Bailiffs of Bristol are accordingly to allow this immunity and not again offer the said Burgesses hindrance or annoy ance in the premises.3-55 Oct. 13, 1223, the King, being here, grants the Burgesses license to take \" customs\" for three years for the purpose of walling their town. This license will have commenced on the expiration of the former one, i. e. on June 24, 1224.256 On Sept. 1, 1226, the King having just left Bridgnorth, and being at Kidderminster, grants, that, tdl he come of age, the men of Bruges may have an annual fair, to last for three days, viz., the vigil, the day and the morrow of St. Luke the Evangelist, unless some neighbouring fair be thus interfered with.257 On the 5th of April, 1227, the King renewed to the Burgesses his Father's Charter, exempting them in precisely the same terms from all toll throughout the kingdom, and alluding to the document already in their possession.258 The following day he granted them power to take customs for two years more, in aid of walling their town.259 On June 20, 1227, another and totally new Charter passed the great seal, which, as recognizing or conferring many privileges, will require lengthened recital.200 It is as follows : \u2014 Heniy by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, 255 Claus, i, 538. which the Charters, called technically \" Inspeximus Charters,\" may be properly said to have originated.

In short Madox's observation on Danegeld and Geld involves the best comment on several other expressions similarly introduced in these documents. \" These words \" he suggests \" were inserted pro forma, amongst several other words referring to Anglo-Saxon Customs which were gone or going into disuse.\"361 On June 28, 1227, the King's Precept issued to the Sheriff of Salop, informing him of the liberties and quietancies which he had granted to the Burgesses of Brug, and commanding him to have the said Charter read in full County Court and to allow the Bur gesses to use then said liberties, and further to give them full seizin of the Mill of Pendestan.363 Our former account of the Constables of Bridgnorth Castle has shown how in the beginning of this very month of June, 1227, Pendestan Mill, having constituted part of the salary of Thomas Manduit, reverted to the Crown on the expiration of that Officer's trust.363 At Michaelmas, 12.27, the Borough begins to be chargeable with a fee-farm rent of \u00a310. per annum for this Mill, whilst, at the same time, the Sheriff, having no receipts from the said Mdl, continues, as when Thomas Manduit received the profits thereof, to take credit for 8 merks (its reputed fiscal value) in his annual accounts. At Michaelmas, 1229,theSheriffso acquits himself of 16merks, and the Burgesses, in addition to the ferm of their town (10 merks per annum), render account of \u00a320. or two years ferm of their Mill.204 261 Exchequer, p. 479. 262 Claus, ii, 190. 203 Supra, p. 277. 204 Rot.

A non-liability, to join in pursuit (of felons) through the town, has already been mentioned as claimed by the Borough. Perhaps the amercement now demurred to, was a similar encroachment on their liberties. At Michaelmas, 1228, the Borough account is charged with an accidental item, viz. \u00a33. Is. 8d. which the Burgesses had paid into the King's Wardrobe at Keri.267 In 1229 the Borough obtained a further grant of \"murage.\"368 At Michaelmas, 1231, the men of Brag, in rendering account of the ferm of their town and mill, charge for carriage of 40 casks of wine from hence to Castle Matilda and to Elvein, and for unloading the rest of the King's wine and storing it at Brug.369 June 15, 1233. \u2014 The Burgesses have license to take \"Customs\" (towards walling their town) for three years.270 At Michaelmas, 1240, the Bailiffs of Brug render account of the proceeds of certain wines of the King which the Sheriff had delivered to them for purpose of sale, under a Royal Order of the King's 19th year (1234-5) .271 Aug. 8, 1241. \u2014 The King, being at Salop, grants this Borough license to take \" Customs \" or murage for 2 years.272 In Jan. 1252. \u2014 A similar Patent occurs extending to 3 years.273 At Michaelmas, 1253, the Borough appears as owing 20 merks of the Auxilium which had been levied \" against the King's transfre tation into Gascony.\"374 This tax does not appear to have been in the nature of a Tadage.

William Bonamy, Phdip de Petra, Henry Coynterel, John de Castro, Henry Fitz Robert, Nicholas the Porter, Widiam le Palmer, Robert Dyer (Tinctor), Robert le Venour, Nicholas de Sallowe, Wdliam Bolding and Hamo le Palmer.275 Amongst their presentments were several which require mention here : \u2014 1 . \"The vills of Quat,Mose, andRomesley were within the Liberty, or did suit to the Hundred, of Brug. 2. The Mill of Pendestan once pertained to the Castle of Brug, but the Burgesses now held it at fee-farm of the King, by Charter, and at an annual rent of 15 merks (\u00a310). 3. The following Religious Houses had interests within the Borough : \u2014 The Abbeys of Buildwas, Lideshall, Haghmon, Wig more, and Crokesden, and the Priory of Wenlock, but the King suffered thereby no loss either in wardships, reliefs, or tallages. 4. The respective tenures of the Knights Hospitallars, Knights Templars and the Nuns of Brewood, within the Borough, were exempt from tallage to the King. 5. The Tenants of the Hospitallers and Templars (three in num ber) were tenants for life. They did not adow themselves to be tallaged, nor would they scott with the men of Brug for the trade which they exercised in the houses thus held. Their exemption was grounded on their vassalage to those privileged orders. 6. The Bailiffs of Brug having apparently distrained, for a debt due to the Crown, in Mose, Ralph de Mose and John his son had rescued the distress.\" At the same time the Jurors for Stottesden Hundred reported that there was no Royal Demesne in their district but Bruges, that that town did not \" answer with them \" nor was the Castle thereof reputed to be in their Hundred. 276 At the Assizes of January, 1256, the Borough of Bruges attended by its xii Jurors.

It is singular that four of these Jurors had been pledges for the appearance, before the Justices, of Alan Fitz William, a man who having been accused of robbery and murder had absconded and died in Ireland. They now however concurred in finding him to have been guilty of the murder, they themselves being declared in miseri cordid for his non-appearance. Further, two of the number actuady stood indicted for being accessory to the said robbery and for receiving the robbers. A Jury of the Country, however, pronounced them \" not guilty.\"378 At these same Assizes a cause was heard wherein the Plaintiff sued for a messuage in Bruges under a writ which was in substance, though not in form, a writ of \" mort d'ancestre.\" The Defendant, taking no notice of the non-identity of form, pleaded at once that the ivrit of \" mort de ancestre \" was not current in Bruges, and this plea was allowed, for the Plaintiff \" took nothing.\"279 In August, 1256, the Burgesses obtained a license to take \" Customs \" for 5 years towards walling their town ; and in September, 1257, this license was renewed for 3 years after expir ation of the five already granted. But on August 16, 1256, the Borough obtained its fourth and fifth Charters from the Crown, and their contents must be fully stated.380 The first281 grants to the Burgesses and their heirs this Franchise, viz. that neither they nor their goods, in any place of the King's dominion, shall be arrested for any debt, for which the parties (thus threatened with arrest) are not bondsmen or principal debtors. This, however, was not to operate in cases where, the actual debtors 278 Ibidem, memb. 10 recto (Placita addressed to the Bailiffs of the town en joining them to try any cause, according to simple right and their own customs.

Shrewsbury, i, 86) from pleading to a writ of \" mort d'ancestre \" concerning any tenement within their franchise. The Bridgnorth Charters, hitherto rehearsed, contain no such exemption for that Bo rough; but I believe it was a privilege which attached to all Manors or Boroughs of \"ancient demesne.\" The alternative seems to have been the \" breve clausum de recto,\" by which I understand a writ 290 Inspeximus of Charters by James I (ut supra). 281 For an explanation of this Charter reference is made to Lord Coke. 2d Inst. p. 204.

The Charter imposes a penalty of \u00a310. on all who should interfere with its provisions. It is dated at Woodstock and tested inter alios, by Thomas Corbet. The other Charter, simdarly dated and attested, provides that the Burgesses and their heirs for ever shad have return of all the King's writs touching the town of Bruges and the liberties thereof; that the Bailiffs of the said town may answer by their own hands at the Exchequer concerning all their debts and summonses of the said Exchequer, respecting the aforesaid town of Bruges; so that no Sheriff or other, the King's Badiff or officer, shad in future enter the said town, either to summon, or to distrain, or to do any other things, unless by default of the Burgesses themselves ; and that no Sheriff, Constable, Castellan, or other officer shall take any Prises within the Borough-Liberties, besides those due and hitherto accus tomed, unless by consent of the owners thereof. It further grants, that the Burgesses shall not be convicted by any strangers (forinse cos) concerning any rights, injuries, trespasses, crimes, claims or demands upon them imposed, but only by their fellow-Burgesses, unless in any matter affecting the (whole) community, and then in that case they were to be sued in conformity with their approved and accustomed liberties. It also allows that the Burgesses may profit themselves of the land and water within their liberties, without hindrance or claim of the Crown or its Badiffs, saving the purprestures, if any ought of right to belong to the Crown ; also that the Burgesses shad not be distrained to buy the King's wines unless by their own wid and con sent, provided however that whde the King's wines are selling there, all other sales of wine shall entirely cease within the Borough. Lastly, it provides, that throughout the King's dominions the Burgesses may hold ad their liberties and free customs hitherto used and approved, as they used them in the time of the King's predecessors and himself. A forfeiture of \u00a310. is imposed on any infraction of the above privileges.

The particular conduct of the Bur gesses is unrecorded, so too is the precise extent of their losses, but each received a genuine and comprehensive acknowledgment which implies the broad fact of loyal devotion as surely as the minutest details could do. In the close of the year 1265, their long expired license to take customs or murage was renewed.283 Now too the King excused them four years' ferm of their vill towards \" the repairs thereof, and in recompense of their losses.\"284 This acquit tance was further increased when, in September, 1267, the King was at Salop : but the extent of the royal gratitude will appear best from the Pipe Rods. I have already alluded to the fact, that after Michaelmas, 1261, the Sheriffs' accounts for Shropshire came to be suspended for five years. An account was made in 1267, but omitted again in 1268, and, as regards the Borough of Brug, no general balance was struck till Michaelmas, 1269. At that time the Burgesses accounted substantively for 80 merks, being eight years' arrears of the/e.... of their vill. Out of this sum (viz. \u00a353. 6s. 8d.) they had paid 80s., or 8 years' tithes, to the Canons of Bruges. Therefore \u00a349. 6s. 8d. remained to be accounted for. They alleged royal acquittances to a greater amount, viz. \u00a310. as excused by the King's writ, for the losses which they had sustained in the lime when the kingdom was disturbed, and because they faithfully adhered to the King, and to Edward his son, in the time aforesaid ; also \u00a364. of the annual ferm of their town and mdl, as excused by a simdar writ. Therefore, under this item of account, the King appeared indebted to the Borough in a sum of \u00a324. 13s. id.; but the debt was balanced in a subsequent section as to the eight years' ferm of Pen deston Mill, which had similarly accrued against the Borough.285 At the County Assizes of September, 1272, the town appeared by one of its Badiffs, William Bolding, and by xn Jurors.286 The names of the latter were, William Palmer, Roger de Mora, Hamo Palmer, Henry de Alley, William Lambert, Roger Dyer, Roger Chete, John Baker (Pystor), William Lantrey, William Bonamy, Richard de Petra, and Henry de Porta.

They had paid for a cask of wine for Hugh de Beaumes, valet of the late King, 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8d.) Also, they had paid to Nicholas de Denton, Hermit of Mount Gilbert (The Wrekin), 13s. id. for his support, by order of the late King.

So also \" Nicolas Rondulf (a Juror) had sold 2 casks and Andrew Bolding (a Bailiff) 6 casks of wine, contrary to the Assize.\" The Jurors also presented that Nicholas Brun, Goldsmith of Brug, \" bought old money for new,\" and likewise was a common entertainer of robbers, who broke open Churches and stole the vessels (calices). \"Nicholas had also stolen a sheep from Roger Chete.\" To all this Nicholas replied, that he was a Clerk ; and the Dean of Salop, as representing the Bishop, came into Court and demanded him as such. -Before he was surrendered to the spiritual power, the Court, as usual, directed that a jury should give verdict on the matters alleged against him. The jurors for Stottesden officiated, and found him \" not guilty\" on each charge. \" So he was given up to the Bishop \" as acquitted by the temporal Court.293 The Borough Jurors further presented that Nicholas Brun 294 and John de Cantreyn would not allow the King's Badiffs to make distraint for a debt of the King or of any one else. Nicholas was found guilty and ordered to prison, but afterwards compounded the offence by fine of half a merk, Fremund de Erdinton and Roger de la More (both Jurors) being his Sureties. A statement of their fee-farm tenure by Charters of Henry III, and a complaint as to Philip de Leinthale, Bailiff of Edmund dc Mortimer, having attached certain traders of their town, are the only further presentments of the Borough Jurors which need be here alluded to. 293 Though NicholasBrun would appear to have been innocent of the principal charges against him, his occupations seem to have been anything but clerical.

The early history of the Borough of Bridgnorth would be unne cessarily incomplete without some attempt to rescue the names of its chief Corporate Officers from those documents which, in the absence of all contemporary Municipal Records, alone remain for our guidance. In arranging the succession of these ephemeral Magistrates according to such documents (chiefly undated), we must variously depend upon proof, probability, and conjecture ; nor wid our limits allow us to particularize the reasons of those presumptive dates which in some cases we shall have to offer. The list thus proposed, whether complete or incomplete, must necessarily indicate the chief contemporary families of the Borough. Not having met with any Bridgnorth Charters of the twelfth Century, when, as at Shrewsbury, the principal Municipal Office is presumed to have been fided by an individual, nominated by the Crown, and called Provost (prepositus) or Reeve, we descend to the time (certainly not earlier than the reign of John 1199-1216) when the Borough elected its own Provosts or chief Magistrates. Their number at all such recorded periods seems to have been uniformly two. These Officers are in the first instance styled Pr\u00e6tors ; \u2014 then Pr\u00e6tors or Provosts, indifferently ;\u2014 thirdly, Provosts ; \u2014 fourthly, Provosts or Bailiffs, indifferently ; \u2014 and lastly, Bailiffs only.295 Richard Fitz Stephen and William Fitz Godewin, Pr\u00e6tors.

The second-named Pr\u00e6tor will presently occur under his professional name of Aurifaber (Goldsmith). Hamo le Palmer and Roger Fitz William, Pr\u00e6tors. The family of Palmer was at this period by far the wealthiest in the Borough. A further and fuller account of them must be given elsewhere. The first notice of Hamon le Palmer is his attestation of the early deed above men- tioned, in which he is described as Hamuud Fitz Walter. Hugo de Eudon and Simon de Abbatia,398 Pr\u00e6tors. Elyas Fitz William and William Aurifaber, Pr\u00e6tors. It is nearly certain that these were in office after Philip Fitz Robert and Terricus Fitz Reginald, mentioned below, but who are in one instance styled Provosts. Walter Aurifaber and Adam Logain, Pr\u00e6tors or Provosts. Philip Fitz Robert and Terricus Fitz Reginald, Pr\u00e6tors or Provosts. As these were probably in office before two who have been mentioned above, so they were certainly later than two who will occur below, viz. Walter le Palmer and Wm. le Berner, who, however, are only called Provosts. Hamo le Palmer and Reginald le Gaugy, Pr\u00e6tors or Provosts. The second was murdered in 1250 or 1251. His family and connexions, with the proceedings consequent on his death, will form the subject of a detailed statement hereafter. The dates obtained therewith are a most useful guide for distinguishing Borough Deeds of the first half of the century from those of the last. Henry Coynterel and Robert Tinctor, Pr\u00e6tors or Provosts. These were in office after 1251, and so, later than many who are only called Provosts. Walter le Palmer and William le Berner, Provosts. Walter le Palmer was Brother of Hamon, above mentioned, and founder of a distinct family. Henry Bacun and Roger Fitz William, Provosts. WilliamFitz Stephen Ordrich and Robert Tinctor, Provosts. The names of these two Magistrates occur as first witnesses of a deed (in Mr. Blakeway's MSS.) wherein the former sells for 12s., and the latter purchases from his Colleague, a rent of 12_. issuing out of a messuage in Hungary Street.

Hamo le Palmer was living at the time when the deed attested by these Provosts passed ; in fact he and his brother Walter are the third and fourth witnesses, and Reginald le Gaugy the fifth. Philip de Petra and John Fitz Robert, Provosts. The deed attested by these Officers is clearly of date 1250 or 1251. It grants, to Walter le Palmer, a 10 years' lease commencing Dec. 25, 1250, and confirms a 12 years' lease which had taken date from Michaelmas 1250, and one of the parties to which was dead. It also mentions lands of Alice de Gaugy ; and she was the widow of Reginald above mentioned. Hamo le Palmer and * * * Provosts. The presumption that Hamo le Palmer was again in office in 1251 or 1252 arises thus. \u2014 He accounts at Michaelmas of the latter year, at the head of the community, for the proceeds of the sale of the King's wines.299 The contemporary accountants for similar sales at Shrewsbury are known to have been Fellow-Provosts of that town. I have not, however, seen any deed, attested by Hamo le Palmer as Provost, which 1 can associate with this precise date. William Bonamy and John Tinctor, Provosts. These must have been in office between 1251 and 1256. At the Assizes of January 1256, John Tinctor was certified to be so infirm as not even to be carried. Philip de Petra and Almaric le Teynturer, Bailiffs. These are expressly mentioned as in office at the Assizes of January, 1256. I have not found them attesting any deed, but if they so occur it will pro- bably be under the designation of Provosts. Philip de Petra and William Bolding, Junior, Provosts. These occur in one deed as Philip super Petram and William Bolding. The latter will be another instance of a son's holding office in the lifetime of his father. Philip de Petra (so often Provost) occurs under various designations besides those just mentioned, viz. Philip Fitz Robert, Philip de la Pere (Pierre), and Philip de Stone.

Earl Robert's removal of the Borough and Castle of Quatford to Bridgnorth naturally led to the further transfer of the Collegiate Church, so richly endowed by his Father. The Parish Church of Quatford indeed remained ; nor does the new Collegiate establish ment appear to have originally combined any parochial cure : in fact it was built within the precincts of the Castle, a situation little consonant with any such responsibility.313 Not a vestige of the history of this Church, or Chapel, remains for the first half century after its removal from Quatford, nor can we expect any further discoveries as regards that period. We have already seen that Earl Roger, endowing his Church of Quatford, granted to it, inter alia, a third of the tithes of Morvdle. It is also clear that the site of Bridgnorth must have been in the Domesday Parish of Morville, and so possibly this, the Earl's original grant of tithes, may have been apportioned on the sub sequent Borough. Either in that way, or by some further grant of King Henry I, certain it is that, on the accession of Henry II, the Canons of Brug were entitled to a recognized composition or annual payment in lieu of the tithes of the King's demesne, which the Borough then was. This sum, 10*. per annum, was paid to the Canons by the Sheriff, and, in turn, charged by him on the Crown in his ac count for the year ending Michaelmas, 1156.314 It so continued to be paid and charged in each annual account of the Sheriff till the year 1176, when, in consequence of an arrangement before particularized,315 the Burgesses were authorized to pay it, and to 313 The Chapel of St. Michael, in Shrewsbury Castle, was in some respects a similar, though less richly endowed foundation than that of St. Mary Magda lene. The Historians of Shrewsbury (vol. ii, pp. 303, 417) seem to have held that a Parish was attached to the former from the earliest period. The evidence given hardly confirms such a view. I am however quite ignorant of the period when a district, with cure of souls, was first assigned to either Chapel. Certainly a petition of the Burgesses of Brug was pre sented to the Parliament of Winchester in 4 Ed. Ill (1330) praying that they might have the use of the King's Chapel as a Parish Church. This is a proof that no such use had been previously made of the Chapel, nor do I think that the petition had any effect even then. 314 Rot. Pip. 2 Hen. II, Salop. 315 Supra, p. 294. It should be observed that as long as the Sheriff paid this annuity he entered it under the title of \"appointed alms,\" not \"tithes.\" \u2014 \"Et in elemosynis constitutis \u2014 Canonieis de Brug, x.s.\" This was rather with a view to con-"], [384, "322 BRIDGNORTH. enter it as a set-off in their own current accounts with the Exchequer. No further change in this respect was made during the period of our present inquiry. The Church, thus recognised by Henry II, fifty years after its foundation, continued to enjoy all those privileges and immunities which attached to Royal Free Chapels. Some of these privileges have already been noticed under the respective lists of Prebendaries; others will now have to be detailed. The general constitution of the Church, with that one peculiarity which distinguished it from all other Royal Chapels, have been set forth in the words of John Bromton,316 whose account needs neither addition nor correction on this head. His statement as to the independent relations which existed between the Dean and Prebendaries is, however, confirmed by a verbal coincidence, too curious to be passed by ; viz. that the Col legiate body is frequently described as consisting of six Pre bendaries, i. e. The superiority of the Dean, a nominal one only, is as often forgotten as remembered. About the year 1196 this Church, or rather its Dean, Simon, was involved in a contest with Wenlock Priory, as to the Advowson of Dudinton (Priors Ditton). This Advowson was no part of Earl Roger's original endowment of St. Mary Magdalene, and the grounds of the Dean's claim, which seems to have been the weaker of the two, are not stated. The composition which ensued left Ditton Church with the Priory, but the Dean and his successors were to receive an annual acknowledgment of two pieces of gold, at Michaelmas, from the Priory.317 This indefinite sum does not enable us to conjecture the strength of the claim which it repre sented. At the Salop Assizes, Nov. 1221, the Jurors of the Borough and Hundred of Bruges returned the Church of Saint Mary of Brug venient classification (the Sheriff being charged with payment of other Royal Alms) than to correctness. When the Burgesses begun to pay the annuity, in 1176, they always entered it under the title of \" appointed tithes.\" \" In decimis constitutis.\" not accurately. The Pope who appointed the Arbitrators was Celestine III (elected March 29, 1191, died Jan. 8, 1198). This, with other limits, implied by the names of the Arbitrators and Witnesses, gives within a year the date laid down in the text. If the two pieces of gold were two mer_s of gold, then the composition for the Dean's claim was considerable, viz. \u00a313: 6_. 8d. 316 Supra, p. 107. 317 Monasticon, vol. v, p. 74. Note 7.

The King's precept issued to the Sheriff of Salop commanding him to allow to this Chapel all tithes of the King's demesnes of Brug, in Fairs and Mids.330 13 Nov. 1234. The King, by Charter dated at Westminster, grants to his Canons of Brug, that they and their successors and their men, holding under them in their Prebends, shall be quit of all suits to the Courts of either County or Hundred.321 The general non-residence of the Prebendaries of Brug has been already presumed. It has also been suggested that no parochial jurisdiction333 attached to the Collegiate Church.' It may even be doubted whether Divine Service was regularly performed in the Chapel of the Castle, either by the Principals in turn, or by their deputies. This will be inferred from the fact, that, in the fiscal year ending Michaelmas, 1239, King Henry III founded a New Chapel in his Castle of Bruges, appointing thereto a Chaplain who was to perform divine sendees and receive a salary of 50*. per annum for his main tenance.323 This salary was paid by the Sheriff for the year then ending, and, substantively, remained a charge on the annual accounts throughout the reign of Henry III. The immunities claimed by the Church of St. Mary Magdalene extended to all the Churches and Chapels which belonged to its Prebendaries. Nay, these Churches were themselves called Free endowment had of course spiritual cures in the Parishes of those Churches. 323 Rot. Pip. 23 Hen. Ill, Salop. This stipend though it appears as regu larly paid upon the Pipe Rolls does not seem to have been of that permanent character which we should term an endow ment, nor, as in the ease of \" constituted alms or tithes,\" was the Sheriff empowered to discharge it without special warrant, e.g. there is an order on the Liberate Roll of 55 Hen.

This observation is grounded on the following documents, which, though they relate specially to the Church of Claverley, which was part of the endowment of the Deanery of Brug, touched matters which concerned the whole Collegiate body. In Easter Term, 1211, in the Courts at Westminster,324 Master Peter de Radenor, Official of the Bishop of Coventry and Lich field and Robert Chaplain of Pattingham were under summons to appear (on April 28th) and show, \" wherefore, against prohibition of the Lord the King they had suspended the Church of Claverley, which is a Free Chapel of the Lord King, and had sequestrated the goods of the same Church, and had caused to be threshed the corn of Peter de Rivallis, Rector of the said Church (he was Dean ol St. Mary Magdalene) for the purpose of levying a contribution for the Lord the Pope, to the grave prejudice of the Crown and dignity of the Lord the King.\" The Defendants appeared not, and the Sheriff sent word that they had no lay fee by which they might be distrained to appear. So mandate issued to the Bishop, that he should have the parties at Westminster in one month of St. John Baptist &c. Accordingly, on the day appointed (July 22), and in continuance of this cause, William de Norbury, Official of the Archdeacon of Stafford, and Elyas Dean of Brug, are stated to have appeared in Court,325 to show wherefore they had suspended the Church of Claverley against the King's prohibition &c. William and Elyas made answer that they never had received the said prohibition. They were bound over to take their trial by Jury, Giles de Erdinton and William Wymer being their Sureties. I cannot learn the issue of this prosecution, but it is quite evident that the King was at length roused by this, and perhaps some similar interferences with the rights of his Free Chapels, and petitioned the Pope (Innocent IV) on the subject. The Pontiff was not inattentive to the remonstrances of \"his beloved and devout Son.\" A Bull exists, dated at Lyons on July 21, 1245, wherein any \" Ordinary, Delegate or Subdelegate is 3:4 Placita apud Westm.

The number of Prebends belonging thereto they said was five, but they went on to enumerate six, the first being \" the Prebend of Claverley,\" which was in fact the Dean's Prebend.331 In 1281, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (Roger de Molend) having apparently asserted a right of jurisdiction over the Collegiate Churches of Stafford, Wolverhampton, St. Mary's Salop, and Tetenhall, was obliged to relinquish such claim in the case of St. Mary's. The particulars of the treaty between the Bishop and that Col legiate Church may be seen elsewhere.333 The independence of the Church was fully recognized, but the Bishop was, if he pleased, to hold ordinations therein. A similar or even more independent position was doubtless secured to the Church of St. Mary Magda lene, for I do not find that the Bishops of Lichfield ever held ordinations there. The taxation of 1291 values the Spiritualities of the Church of Bruges, and its members, at \u00a354. 13s. id.

At the Assizes of 1292, the Prebends were duly returned, as six in number, that of the Dean being caded the Prebend of Lud deston.334 At the same Assizes the Dean and Chapter stood summoned, to show by what warrant they claimed a right of holding pleas of the Crown, and having ways in the Manor of Bruges. Not appearing, the Sheriff had orders to distrain them through all their lands &c, and to have their persons before the Justiciars who were to be in eyre at Lichfield in the Octaves of Hillary (Jan. 20, 1293).335 The Record preserves the results of many causes similarly adjourned to Lichfield, but the Crown prosecution of its own Free Chapel seems to have been abandoned.

The visit of Master Rigaud de Asserio to England, in 1317, affected the rights of several Royal Free Chapels, viz. St. Martin's le Grand (London), St. Peter's ( Wolverhampton) , and thc Chapels of Stafford, Bruges, and St. Mary's (Salop). Being Canon of Orleans, Auditor of the Palace, and Clerk of the Papal Chamber, he was deputed by Pope John XXII to enforce the neglected codection of the Peter Pence in England.336 ln so doing, he was to ignore all customs, privileges, and indulgencies whatever, the Pope decreeing the same to be of no avail. The King (Edward II) interfered in defence of his Free Chapels above mentioned, and by Writ Close addressed to the Nuncio him self, and dated at Shene, 17 Feb. 1318, forbade him to enforce his exactions against those establishments.337 The \" Inquisitions of the Ninthp,\" taken in 1341, and with which we will conclude this subject, give incidentally one or two hints as to the ecclesiastical divisions which then existed within tbe Peculiar of Bridgnorth. The Dean and Canons are specially stated to be exempt from the tax then assessed ; and this exemption so far diminished the rate able value of each Parish or District wherein the Chapter had lands. The effect of this immunity on the assessments of Morville, Quatford, and Eardington, has been already shown or presumed.338 Towns, instead of being rated to the value of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, were more appropriately taxed at the ninth of the goods of their Burgesses. Thus while Shrewsbury was assessed at \u00a356. 2*. 10d., the town of Brugge stood at \u00a316. 10s. Id., a special valuation pro re nata, and not based on the inapplicable taxation of Pope Nicholas. The reasons why it was not rated higher were,\u2014 \"because the townships of Romsley, Quat, Dudmaston, and Quat ford, stood taxed under other valuation \" (viz. that of the Parish Churches where they were),- \u2014 '\u25a0' and because the King had taken out in wool, both in England and abroad, the contributions of several Burgesses.\"339 The King's demesne Manor of Claverley was also taxed on this 336 He eventually came to be Bishop of Winchester (Consecrated 16 Nov. 1320.

They assessed it at \u00a312., and gave reasons why they had rated it so low. They said that \" a sixth part of the Borough of Bruggeuorth belonged by ancient extent to the Church of Claverley.\" (By this they must have meant some income which the Dean derived from Quatford, or other property within the Borough Liberties, and which, though it in creased the value of the said Dean's Church of Claverley, could not be taken to represent any means of the now taxed Parishioners.) They also said, that \"the greater\" (but unmentioned) \"Church Taxation included items which had nothing to do with the ninth now levied, viz. Jurisdiction\" (the Peculiar jurisdiction of the Dean I suppose), \"glebe-land, offerings, tithe of hay, and other small tithes.\" They also said, that \" a third of the present assessment, viz. 6 merks (_24.) lay on a part of the parish which was in the County of Stafford.\" This, if I understand the clause rightly, alluded partly to Bobbington, but surely included lands which must since have been annexed to Shropshire.341 The circumstance seems to have been of no import as regarded the tax, but the Commissioners, being appointed to the County of Salop only, probably thought it proper to particularize any deviation from the letter of their in structions. DEANS OF SAINT MARY MAGDALENE. A list of these Dignitaries will necessarily involve the succession of the Rectors of Claverley, which Church was a constant and pro minent feature among the various endowments of the Deanery of Bridgnorth.

The Deanery of Brug is to be part of the grant, and the balance is to be made up, out of rents heretofore enjoyed by the Dean of York and Archdeacon of Winchester. The King avows his object in this grant. It is that the friends of the Presentee, \"who are very necessary to the King in the parts of Poitou may be placed under obligation.\" A more formal presentation to the Deanery, dated at Partenay (in Poitou) on May 28 following, is addressed to the Viceroy, and calls the new Dean Hugh de Taunay.346 At the Salop Assizes, November, 1221, the Jurors of Claverley are represented by the minute-clerk as returning Hugh de \" Pettem\" for the Incumbent of Claverley Church. It was worth 30 merks per annum, and the said Hugh held it, they said, by gift of King John.347 The Incumbent in question was doubtless the Dean pre sented by that monarch as above stated, but the Jurors describing him by his country, either mutdated the proper words, or were mis understood by their Registrar. \" Hugh le Peitevin\" was the name they intended to return. Peter de Rivallis was appointed to the Deanery of the Chapel of Brug, by Letters Patent of Henry III, dated at Westminster, 8 May, 1223. The Chapter is addressed as to the presentation, and the Constable of Brug as to giving possession.348 On 18 August, 1223, the King's Letters Close direct Brian de Lisle to allow Peter de Rivadis 18 beams (fusta) out of Kinver Forest, which the King has given him to repair his house at Claverley.349 These two entries identify the Rectors of Claverley with the Deans of Brug most satisfactordy.

Somerset, Dorset, Devon, Lancaster, Northumb. Essex, Herts. Lincoln, Norf. Suff. and Kent.350 This extraordinary Patent did not operate for two years, even as regarded the two Counties granted for life, for on May 15, 1234, Robert de Haia, hitherto the Deputy of Peter de Rivallis, was appointed Sheriff absolute.351 This will be explained by what Matthew Paris tells us of this favourite of the Crown, and his fortunes.352 And here I must not hesitate to give some lengthy extracts from that Chronicler. The career of this Dean of St. Mary Magdalene, is connected with great events and interests. His name is the chief feature of our list, and, not having held any other distinguished Church Preferment, it is not probable that his biography has been attempted elsewhere. \u2014 Peter de Rivallis (or Orivallis) was a Poitevin by descent, osten sibly the Nephew, perhaps really the Son, of Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester, the all-powerful Minister, first of King John, and afterwards of Henry III. It was in 1232 that the Bishop's influence (growing greater by the fall of Hubert de Burgh) secured for his relative the appointment of \"Treasurer of the Chamber\" in the King's household. This office gave him the custody of all the Crown Escheats and Wardships,353 and his success in replenishing the Royal Coffers was most unequivocal. In the year 1233 Matthew Paris relates that the Bishop and Peter de Rivadis, with their Deputies (Stephen de Segrave and Robert Passelewe) possessed the sole confidence of the King, and whilst the Bishop disposed all the affairs of the kingdom to his own liking, the custody of the Royal Castles was bestowed on Peter de Rivallis. \u2014 This must be an allusion to the various Shrievalties which had been conferred on him in the previous year. It was probably the ascendancy of Peter de Rivallis in Shrop shire, which, in January, 1234, drew upon that County the animosity of Richard Marshall, Earl of Pembroke. That nobleman, disgusted with the favour shown by Henry to \"the Poitovins,\" as his Ministers were called, and by the treatment which he himself had experienced from the King, was then in open rebellion. Leaguing with Llcwelin he laid waste the County to the very gates of Shrews- 353 Vide Rot. Fin. passim, sub annis 1232, 1233. 350 Pat. 16 Hen. III. 351 Pat 18 Hen. III. 3:2 Matth.

This letter, addressed to the Magnates of Ireland, and purporting to be sanctioned by the King, announced the forfeiture and proscription of the Earl in England, ordered his instant arrest, if he appeared in Ireland, and promised partition of his estates there, to those who would assist in his capture. Eleven members of the Poitovin government constituted themselves sureties for the King's fulfilment of this promise. The Magnates of Ireland, not satisfied with the form of these instructions, sent messengers requiring the King's sealed-Charter on the subject. To meet their demands the Poitovins are actually said to have forged the required document, and to have affixed the the Great Seal without knowledge or consent of the King or his Chancellor, The plot succeeded. The Earl, hearing of the con sequent invasion of his Irish possessions, crossed the Channel in February, 1234. Entrapped into a skirmish on the 1 st of April, he maintained against fearful odds the dignity of his name and office, but fell, dangerously wounded, into the hands of his enemies. His captivity and sufferings, when at length his recovery seemed possible, were aggravated by every species of malice. \u2014 The forged Charter, ordering his seizure and forfeiture, was paraded before his eyes. \u2014 His lands and Castles were peremptorily required of him. \u2014 He was threatened with lawful execution as a rebel taken in battle. \u2014 A surgical operation, used indeed at the period, but barbarous beyond expression, was applied to his wound without ostensible necessity. The Chirurgeon employed, wantonly and wilfully, increased its severity. The Earl was attacked with .acute fever and died on the 16th day of his captivity (April 16, 1234). Thus, by the machination of the Poitovins, fell one who was reputed to be the \" Flower of Chivalry in his day.\"356 Meanwhile, that is on Feb. 2, King Henry, in a conference at Westminster, had heard the grave remonstrances of his Bishops. His animosity against the Earl Marshal, the favour shown to 354 Vide History of Shrewsbury, vol. i, p. Ill, where it is probably enough suggested that only part of the suburbs, viz.

A second conference, on April 9th, again confronted the King and his Prelates. The latter, now headed by Edmund, their recently consecrated Metropolitan, recapitulated the grievances which afflicted the whole kingdom : they even threatened the King with excommunication. In a few days the Bishop of Winchester had orders to quit the Court, and Peter de Rivallis to give up his Castles. The latter was also required to render account of all his treasury business, the King swearing (as the exulting Chronicler tells us), that, had it not been for his clerical office, he would have ordered his eyes to be put out.356 When Easter (April 23) was past, the King journeyed towards Gloucester. Resting a night at Woodstock,357 news reached him of the death of the Earl Marshal in Ireland. The King's grief, genuine or not, was unbounded in expression. At Gloucester he became reconciled with Hubert de Burgh and others, who had pre viously deserved or provoked the Royal displeasure. There, too, his anger against the Poitovins reached its height, on discovery of the forgery and fraud which had ended in the death of the Earl Marshal.358 The Poitovins and their accomplices were Murderers, and were immediately served with summonses to appear before the King on June 24 following, and then give account both of their management of the Royal Treasure and their misuse of the Royal Seal. The Bishop and Peter de Rivallis at once took asylum in Winchester Cathedral, Stephen de Seagrave and Robert Passelewe elsewhere. An adjourned day was appointed for their trial, viz. July 14, at Westminster. Then and there they appeared, their safe conduct 356 M. Paris, sub anno. It is evident that the political feeling of this Chronicler seriously compromises his accuracy. After this Council (of April 9th) he tells us that the King despatched the Archbishop and several Suffragans into Wales to treat with Lewellyn and the Earl Marshall ; while he elsewhere shows us that the Earl had left Wales two months earlier, and was now dying in Leland. The known date also (May 15) when Peter de Rivallis was deprived of the Shrievalty of Shrop shire hardly tallies with such an explosion of Royal anger so long before as April 9th. 357 The King was at Woodstock on May 9th (Rot. Pat.). 353 This appears to have been on May 29, when also, at Gloucester, the Patent appointing Robert de Haya, Sheriff of Shropshire, was repeated.

Peter de Rivallis was first put upon his defence. \" He appeared before the King in a Clerical garb with the tonsure and broad crown, but with an anelace 359 hanging from his belt. He reverently saluted the King, who was sitting on the Bench with his Justiciars. The King, regarding him with a fierce glance, exclaimed, ' O Traitor, by thy iniquitous device I unwittingly affixed my seal to letters which betrayed the Earl Marshal _ also by thy base counsel did I banish him and other born Englishmen (homines nalurales) from the kingdom, and alienated their hearts and affections from my person. It was the false prompting of thee and thy accomplices which induced me to levy war upon those men, to my own irre parable loss and the disgrace of the kingdom ; by which war I grievously threw away my own treasure and honour, and the lives of idustrious subjects.' The King, moreover, required from him account of his treasure and the custodies of noble wards and escheats, with many other sources of revenue which belonged to the Crown.\" \"The accused denied none of the charges which were made against him, but falling on the earth before the King implored mercy in these words : ' My Lord King,' said he, ' I have been nurtured by you and made rich in temporal goods : ruin not the man of thy own creating ; but at least grant me time to deliberate, so that I may render due account as to the things which you demand.' The King decided that the required deliberation should take place in the Tower. Peter remonstrated, saying that he was a Clerk and might not be imprisoned or given into custody of laymen. The King answered that the accused had ever demeaned himself as a layman, and as a layman he was now required to give account of his \" Stewardship \u25a0 \" he should, however, be given into custody of the Archbishop if the latter would be responsible foi the alleged exactions of the Minister. The Archbishop kept silence ; so Peter was committed to the Tower, the King confiscating all his lay possessions, ' because, under his clerical habit he wore a breast plate and carried an anelace at his girdle, as became not a Clerk.' \" Peter remained two days in the Tower, and was then restored by the Archbishop to his asylum in Winchester Cathedral. The trial of Stephen de Segrave resulted in his release, his main 359 A large knife used indifferently at table, or as a dagger."], [396, "334 BRIDGNORTH. defence being the inculpation of Peter de Rivallis, as his Principal. The disgrace of neither lasted for more than two years, and their full restoration to Royal favour in June, 1236, makes the insincerity of Henry's conduct, at the time of their trial, only too apparent. The King had most probably acted a concerted part to free himself from the stigma of the Earl Marshall's death. The descendant of him, who, having instigated the murder of Becket, affected to abhor the deed, but only for a time repudiated its perpetrators, \u2014 the Grandson of Henry II seems to have inherited both the malice and the craft of his ancestor. In 1249 Peter de Rivallis appears as joint Custos. of the Great Seal during the temporary absence of the Chancedor from Court.360 At the Inquisition of 1255, the Jurors for the Borough of Brug returned his Prebend as involving the Church of Claverley, with its members of Bobiton, Burchton, and Quatford, and being of the annual value of 40 merks.301 The more- detailed presentments of the Jurors of Claverley, on the same subject, shall be given when we come to that Manor. From November, 1256, to April, 1258, Peter de Rivallis appears in his old office of Treasurer of the King's Wardrobe ; and the last which I have to say of him is in a Charter dated May 20, 1258, whereby the King grants him a piece of land in Winchester at a fee-farm rent of 2d. per annum.363 The time of his death I cannot determine, but on 18 Feb. 1265, a Patent is on the Rolls, whereby \u2014 Stephen de London was presented to the Deanery of Brug. A second Patent, dated March 2, 1265, and addressed to the Constable, appoints \u2014 William de Montfort to the same preferment.363 The latter had already (by grant of Feb. 7) a Prebend in the Church. His name, and the period of these grants, sufficiently point out his connexion with Simon de Montfort, the then disposer of the Royal patronage and Keeper of the Royal person. The advantages which accrued to the relatives of that ardent patriot will not have been permanent. I cannot suppose that William de Montfort held the Deanery, thus conferred, after the event of August 4, 1256 ; but. I find not the appointment of his Successor, who was Dean in September, 1266.

The Defendants appeared not, and had made previous defaults. Walter being a Clerk, the Bishop of Chester was enjoined to cause his appearance on the quinzaine of Easter. The other Defendants had lands in Mutton and Lutley, whereby the Sheriff was to distrain them to appear at the same term.364 This cause was associated with another which was in progress at the time, some detads of which shall be given here, though they might more properly appear under Bobington. It would seem that Walter de Cokesaye, the above Defendant, having been presented to Bobington Church by John Fitz Phdip, was ejected by Michael de Fynes, who claimed the Advowson as a member of his Deanery. The com, said to have been carried off, was probably the property of the rightful Incumbent, whoever that might be. Thus, while the Dean prosecuted Walter for trespass, Walter sued the Dean for ejectment. The latter suit came before the King himself at Shrewsbury, in August or September, 1267, and was adjourned for further hearing to Saturday, September 10th.365 On that day Walter did not appear, and was pronounced to be in contempt?66 He was further summoned to appear before the King at Westminster on October 13th, to answer for the said contempt, and to hear sentence in the suit. Still he came not, so his manucaptors, Hugh de Bolinghale, Widiam le Eyr, Robert de Mere, Wdliam Provost of Bobington, and Henry de Prestwood, were declared to be in misericordid, and the Sheriff was ordered to have their bodies in Court on February 3, 1268.367 On the same 13th of October, William de Gundeville, as Attorney for the King, and Michael de Fines, by his Attorney, appeared against Philip de Mutton, Walter de Cokesaye &c., in the plea of 364 Placita coram Rege.

It would now seem that the non-appearance of Walter was attributable to the Bishop, whom thereupon the Sheriff was ordered to attach personally and have in Court on Feb: 3, 1268. On February 3, however, Walter himself appeared in Court. The trespass with which he was charged was stated to have been com mitted on Friday, Sept. 3, 1266. He now denies the violence and injury &c. (in the usual form), and appeals to a Jury of the Country. The Sheriff is accordingly instructed to summon such Jury to appear before the King, in. five weeks of Easter (circa May 13, 1268) ?w The same day was given to William de Gundeville (the King's Attorney) and John Fitz Philip, in their cross-suit.370 Ou that day (May 13) a further adjournment took place, viz. to the quinzaine of the Holy Trinity, i. e. June 17, 1268.371 I find no record of what took place then ; but a memorandum or Postscript added to the Roll of Michaelmas Term, 1 267 (above cited) states what I take to have been the ultimate result of both suits. On July 1, 1268, Michael de Fynes (as Prosecutor for the Crown) and John Fitz Philip came into Court, and John, by license of the said Court, rendered up seizin of the Advowson of Bobington, saving to himself his right, whenever he should again choose to stir in the cause. The Sheriff was hereupon ordered to give the King full seizin of the aforesaid Advowson. At the Salop Assizes, October 1272, a new Dean of Brug had been appointed and was then in possession. \u2014 : Master Bonetas de Saint Quintin was returned by the Jurors of the Borough as holding the Prebend of Claverley, which was of 60 merks annual value.372 Pope Nicholas Taxation (1291) does not give the name of the then Dean of Brug, nor does it mention specifically his Church of Claverley or its value, but, under the Deanery of Lapley and Tresel, it values the Spiritualities of the Church of Brug at \u00a354. 13*. 4c..373 This, as I have before said, probably referred to the endowment of the chief Prebend or 368 Ibidem, memb. 8 dorso.

These Jurors valued the Prebend at 100 merks (\u20ac66. 13s. id.) per annum.378 Walter de Langton being a Canon of Lichfield, was elected Bishop of that See 20 Feb. 1296, and consecrated 22 Dec. in the same year. He obtained a license to hold his Deanery in com mendam, provided he could get a five years' dispensation from the Pope.379 The latter seems to have been denied him, for on 8 April, 26 Edw.

They were, \u2014 \u2022 John Mansel, who, at his death in 1264, was seized of a Pre bend here (perhaps Morville and Underdon) . It is fitting to say who he was. Through a period of twenty-five years he was employed in various offices of honour and trust by King Henry III. He was his Envoy to the Emperor of Germany in 1238 : in 1242, he accompanied the King abroad, and was made prisoner by the French at the battle of Xantoigne : he was Chancellor of England from Nov. 1246 to Oct. 1249 : and Ambassador to the King of Castile in 1254. In July, 1262, he accompanied the King abroad, as Keeper of the Great Seal, and returned with him to England in December following. When, in 1263, the Queen left England, John Mansel, fearing the animosity and increasing power of the Barons' party, 333 Supra, p. 114.

He was reputed to be the \" richest Clerk in the world.\" He founded the two Priories of Bilsington and Rumney, in Kent. His death happening during the King's captivity, the Earl of Leicester presented Almaric de Montfort to the Treasurership of York.301 A similar use of the Great Seal on 7 Feb. 1265, appointed \u2014 William de Montfort to the Prebend which John Mansel had held in the Church of Brug.392 We have already shown the Deanery to have been conferred on this new Prebendary on the 2d of March following, and that his tenure of either will, under the circumstances of the appointments, have expired in a few months.303 In 1295, \u2014 William, son of William de Bruges, was presented to a Pre bend in this Church ; 394 and in 1334\u2014 Robert de Tanton had a similar appointment.395 CHANTRY OF ST.

Town.399 It is hardly supposable that the Borough, even in its infancy, was without such an establishment. Though the site of Brug was comprehended in the great Saxon Parish of Morville, and though the Mother Church of Morville was, in the days of King Henry I, no mean structure, its proximity can hardly have been sufficient for the spiritual wants of a rising Borough. It is, moreover, probable in one case, and certain in the other, that Tasley and Oldbury, subject Chapels of Morvdle, and nearer to Brug than the Mother Church, were yet unfounded in the begin ning of the reign of Henry I. To that early period, as coeval with the foundation of the Borough, we may therefore reasonably assign the foundation of St. Leonard's; but, as yet, no architectural or documentary evidence occurs to strengthen this assumption. The earliest written notice to which I can refer on this subject, is an undated deed, which, though it implies the pre-existence of the Church of St. Leonard's, cannot itself be positively ascribed to an older period than the middle of the thirteenth century.\u2014 \"Roger, Son of Richard Irish (Hybernensis) sells to Walter Palmer, for 6s., a rent of 6d., issuing from certain field-land without the Cemetery of St. Leonard, which land William Sholton held of the Vendor at said rent. \u2014 Witnesses : Elias Fitz William and William Aurifaber, Pr\u00e6tors of Brug, Hamo Palmer, Walter Aurifaber, John, Son of William de Cantreyn, Hugh de Eudon, John his Brother, and many others.\"400 At the Inquisitions of 1255, the Borough Jurors returned the Church of St. Leonard as being in the King's gift.401 The Taxation of 1291 does not mention this Church.

This House, dedicated also to the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist, is reputed, on good evidence, to have been founded by Ralph le Strange, Lord of Alveley, in the time of Richard I. Records, unconnected with this foundation, and which will be cited elsewhere, inform us of the dlness and early death of Ralph le Strange, in 1195, while actively engaged in the King's service in Wales. Such circumstances, and the period at which they occurred (soon after the Crusade of Richard I), fitly associate themselves with the origin of this establishment, as declared by tradition. Referring to other authorities for the constitution and objects of these houses in general,406 and for many particulars of this, I will merely state those circumstances which further dlustrate its history, and have not hitherto been brought together. The Hospital, usually called St. John's, stood in the Low Town of Bridgnorth, within the angle formed by Mill Street and St. John's Street, east of the former and north of the latter, to which it, of course, communicated its name. Thus placed, the house commanded every highway by which travellers could approach the Town from places lying Eastward of the Severn. In other words, the various roads, which, traversing or skirting the great Forest of Morf, from Pendleston Mill, from served the rule of St. Austin, and probably subjected the poor and impotent to some religious restraints, as well as to the local statutes. Hospitals were originally de signed for relief and entertainment of travellers upon the road and particularly of pilgrims, and therefore were generally built upon the road's side ; but of later years they have always been founded for fixed inhabitants.\" (Preface to Notit. Monastica, p. xviii, Nasmith's edition.) 404 Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 199. 405 Willis' Abbies, ii, 193. 406 Tanner describes these Hospitals as \"houses for the relief of poor and im potent people, incorporated by Royal Patents, and made capable of gifts and grants in succession.\" \" Besides the poor and impotent,\" says he, \" there generally were in these Hos pitals two or three Religious : one to be Master or Prior, and one or two to be Chaplains and Confessors ; and these ob- 11"], [406, "344 BRIDGNORTH. Worfield, from Claverley, or from Quatford, converged towards the Eastern end of the Bridge, will have first passed within sight of St. John's. This situation was doubtless relevant to the primary object of such a foundation, viz. the relief of travellers. The road by which St. John's was approached from Quatford, on the South, was further called Spital (.. e. Hospital) Street ; but it seems doubtful whether that name was derived from the Hospital under notice, or the Hospital of St. James, presently to be men tioned. The earliest Royal recognition of the former bears date at Salop, 9 March, 1223, \u2014 when Henry III grants to the Brethren of the Hospital of St. John, of Brug, twelve cart loads of dry wood in Mors Forest. This precept is addressed to Hugh Fitz Robert (Forester of Shropshire) and tested by Hubert de Burgh.407 On Aug. 30, 1226, King Henry III, then at Bruges, commands the same Hugh Fitz Robert to allow the Master and Brethren of the Hospital of the Holy Trinity^ of Bruges to have three oak trees in Mors Forest for their fire, of the King's gift.408 At the Inquisition of 1255, in answer to a question as to the alienation of Serjeantries, or of any part thereof, the Jurors of Bruges said, that the Prior of the Hospital of Brug held half a virgate of Ralph de Eudinas (Ewdness), whose tenure was by Ser jeantry.409 The Jurors of Nordley Regis and Alveley, on the same occasion, and in answer to an inquiry as to tenants of lands within those demesne Manors, said that the Hospital of the Holy Trinity of Brug held therein three and a half virgates of land, by Testament of Ralph le Strange. The Jurors knew not by what service the Hos pital held this land, but they stated that the Priors had withdrawn all suit, from the local Manor-Court, to Brug.410 In 1274, the Jurors of the same two Manors reported the ancient alienation of 3\\ virgates in Alveley, by \" Ralph, son of Guy le Strange, who granted the said land in free and perpetual almoigne to the Hospital of St. John, of Brug.\" 411 In Oct. 1292, the Master of the Hospital of St. John was sued under writ of right, by the Crown, for this land, described as 407 Claus. 7 Hen.

It is thus observable that, during the first century after its founda tion, this House was variously described as the Hospital of the Holy Trinity, or of St. John, and its chief officer indifferently called Master or Prior, facts which will correct several misstatements on the subject. I must refer to a note for further and fuller accounts of this establishment, or rather for such parts of other accounts as are free from error.413 412 Placita de Quo Warranto, p. 674. been lineal descendant and heir of Ralph le Strange, the Founder of this Hospital) however genuine itself, involves a gross error, and that the Pedigree by which those Jurors supported then- finding was a false one. 413 See Dukes' Antiquitiea of Shropshire, pp. 50, 51, where a Seal of one of the Masters of this Hospital is engraved, and some, not irrelevant, documents quoted; but a second Seal and two of the docu ments, there given, have nothing to do with this house, but relate to the Society of Friars Minors, presently to be noticed, and whose house stood West of the Severn.

The Great Valuation of 1535 mentions this House in no other connexion than as a dependency of the Abbey of Lylleshall, which had long before obtained custody hereof.414 That Abbey therefore enumerates amongst its temporal possessions an annual income of \u00a323. arising in Brigenorthe and Alveley. This large item probably included other revenue than that which had accrued with this Hospital,415 for the Abbey had a distinct property in Bridgnorth, hereafter to be noticed, and appears to have held several leases of lands at Bridgnorth and Alveley under the Monks of Shrewsbury, the Nuns of Brewood, the Chantry of St. Thomas (in St. Leonard's Church), the Lords of Oldbury and of Netherton (near Quatford), and under several Burgesses of Bridgnorth. Some of these leases held, or rather quit-rents payable, by the Abbey of Ldleshall, in 1535, may however have been originady concerns of the Hospital. It is impossible, in short, to distinguish in this Valuation what lands the Abbey held as its own, what it acquired with the Hospital, or what, after it obtained the Hospital, it may have purchased or leased, in addition. Besides these quit-rents, the property of Ldleshall Abbey in this quarter was chargeable in other ways. \u2014 , An annual fee of 8*. 8c?. was due for regard to the King's Forester of Morf : \u2014 Richard Horde, Seneschall of Bridgnorth and Alveley, had a salary of \u00a31. per annum. \u2014 The Chaplain of the Chantry of Jesus, in Lichfield Cathedral, was in receipt of an annual pension of \u00a36. 13s. 4d. which had originally been payable by the Hospital. \u2014 A similar pension the Abbey also paid to the Chaplain, who still performed divine service in the Hospital Church. \u2014 Inquis. ad quod Damnum, 19 Edw.

This Establishment belonged to a class essentially distinct from that of the Hospital of St. John above noticed, or of Hospitals in general. The word Hospital, in its commonest modern acceptation, and the Latin word Hospitium convey a contrast of idea very similar. \u2014 Sickness or disease are the prevailing notions involved in the former word, hospitality or shelter in the latter. So it was with these neighbouring and almost adjoining houses at Bridgnorth. While such societies as St. John's contemplated the relief of travellers, pilgrims, the poor, the aged, and the infirm in general, St. James's Leper House was intended only as a refuge for persons afflicted with formidable and perhaps contagious disease. In written documents, it is usually described as the Domus Leprosorum Sancti Jacobi, or as Maladria Sancti Jacobi, the latter term being the Latinized form for the French Maladrarie?16 It stood East of the road which led from St. John's Hospital towards Quatford, and on the outside of the Town, a situation corresponding aptly with its design. Its Founders were probably the Community of the Borough of Brug, and such an establishment may well have been a part of the internal economy of the Town. The origin or multiplication of these Lazarettos may perhaps be connected with a decree of the Eleventh General Councd, which assembled in the Church of St. John Lateran, in March, 1179, under the auspices of Pope Alexander III. The eleventh Canon, there promulgated, was entitled \" De Leprosis,\" and ran as fodows : 417- Aldebur\" (sichetum Reymundi et siche tum versus Aldebur). (Charier at Apley Park) 416 There seems to have been a Mala drerie near Bridgnorth of older date than that of St. James, being described in deeds as \" Yetus Maladria.\" It lay on the Old bury side of the Town, and abutted on two ditches or water-courses called \"Rey rnund's ditch,\" and thc \" ditch towards 417 Chron. Gervas. Inter Decem Scrip tores, p. 1450.

Which thing being evidently quite opposed to Christian piety, we, in Apostolick kindness, ordain that, wherever so many be congregated under a common mode of life as may suffice to budd themselves a Church or Cemetery, and enjoy the ministry of their own Priest, they shall be permitted to have such advantages without contradiction.

And we further ordain that they be not compelled to give tithes of their gardens, or of the forage of their live-stock.\" Many of the large Towns of England had establishments, thus indicated and encouraged, in the thirteenth century. The Leper House of St. James was certainly founded previously to 1224 ; for on 22 September, in that year, King Henry III, being then at Bruges, issued the fodowing Certificate to Hugh Fitz Robert, Forester of Shropshire: \u2014 \"Know, that for the reverence of God, and for the health of our soul, and the soul of the Lord King John, our Father, we have granted to the Leprous Brethren of the Hospital of St. James at Bruges, that they may have one horse, dady plying in our Forest of Mors, to collect dry stumps and dead wood for their fire, untd we come of age.\" A similar Certificate was addressed to Hugh de Nevill, Justice of the Forest.418 seem to indicate that the term \"Leprosy\" was applicable only to contagious disease or what was believed to be so. On the other hand it is well known that paralytic affections were classified under the same term \" Leprosy\" in the middle ages ; and (whereas Paralysis can scarcely have been accounted infectious even then) it would appear that the term was used to denote Bevere disease in a much more general sense than modern notions can at once apprehend. the necessity or propriety of the sufferer's abstinence from social intercourse ; that those who, under compulsion, or volun tarily, adopted this theory, formed societies of themselves, and that they came to be called Lepers, because their separate mode of life associated their condition with that of those, whom the well-known Scriptural plague of Leprosy banished from society and united to one another. 413 Claus. 8 Hen.

On Oct. 14, 1259, King Henry III granted letters patent of pro tection for the Lepers of St. James of Bruges, for five years.431 The endowment of a Chaplain in 26 Edw. Ill (1352-3), whose duties were partly connected with the Church of this Hospital, has been already noticed.433 In 1535, this Hospital is valued as annually in receipt of \u00a3i. net income. It was, however, then governed by a Superior, who is called Prior. His name was William Beyste.433 I refer elsewhere for further particulars.434 FRANCISCAN oe GREY FRIARS. This Order, caded also the Order of Friars Minors, was intro duced into England early in the thirteenth Centuiy. Its members established themselves in many of our principal towns during the reign of Henry III. The English Province of the Order came to be divided into seven districts, called \"Custodies,\" because a Custos or Keeper presided over all Convents within each such district. The House at Bridgnorth, founded in the time of Henry III, and dedicated to Saint Francis, was one of the nine Monasteries which were subject to the Custody or Wardenship of Worcester.425 It lay to the West of the Severn, under the Church of St. Leo nard's. Some adjoining vaults are still known as the \" Friars' 421 Pat. 43 Hen. III. I am favoured by Hubert Smith, Esq., with an extract of a deed whereby, in June, 16 Edw.

If we attempt to associate such establishments with the names of specific Founders, we shall usuady be in error. The sycophancy or ignorance of a later period has invented or believed the falsest tales about the origin of the various English Houses of Friars. The probability is, that the first members of these fraternities located themselves in our large Towns, under no specific or marked patronage, and worked their way onwards as best they could. In process of time, the name of some influential Founder, or Patron, was seen to be a kind of protection, and so adopted by each Society for itself. Not knowing their Founders, the Franciscans extemporized them ; and their new Patrons, the descendants of such alleged Founders, were perhaps not studious to expose the complimentary fraud. In the case of this House at Bridgnorth, which claimed John Earl of Shrewsbury for its Patron, as the descendant of Ralph de Strange, its alleged Founder, the idea was doubtless borrowed from a similar claim of the Brethren of St. John's Hospital, in the Low Town. Such pretence of the Franciscans, though it involved a double falsehood, conveyed also a double compliment to their adopted Patron; for not only did it flatter John Talbot with a fictitious ancestry, but gave to such untrue Ancestor the merit of a founda tion with which neither he nor his Descendants, real or imaginary, had anything to do. Passing a statement which I cannot substantiate,437 and which this House of Grey Friars to John Earl of Shrewsbury, in time of Henry VI. Ralph le Strange however was, as I have already said, no ancestor of John Earl of Shrewsbury. He, Ralph, died when St. Francis (the Founder of this Rule) was not yet fourteen years of age, also fourteen years before St. Francis originated the Order, and twenty-four years before it was introduced into England. Ralph le Strange, therefore, was not . the founder ; and neither was John Earl of Shrewsbury, who flourished in the reign of Henry VI, ora century and a half after the time when I shall show this House to have been in existence. Similarly false allegations as to their foundership by tho Dominican, Austin, and Franciscan Friars of Shrews bury, are alluded to or exposed by the Historians of that town.

The Seal of one of these is also engraved on page 50 of Mr. Dukes' book, whereby I perceive that these Franciscans called themselves occa sionally Preachers (Predicatores).

At the Assizes of October, 1272, the Jurors of the Borough made the following presentment as to a purpresture on the King's demesne,438 viz., that the Friars Minors (Fratres Minores) had, eight years back, enclosed the King's highway on the bank of the Severn ; whereby the King was damaged yearly to the extent of half a merk. \" They also take,\" said the Jurors, \" stones and rubbish from the bank of the Severn, and throw them into the River, whereby they have realized to themselves apiece of ground, 150 feet long and 50 feet wide, and this they have enclosed. By which process the (artificial) bank causes the water to pound upon (inundare) the King's mills, the damage whereunto is five merks per annum, and this was done 16 years back.\" At this time, too (1272), the Friars had built their Church, for the same Jurors reported that a Prisoner, who had been imprisoned by Hugh de Acovere, the Sheriff (1255-6), \"escaped to the Church of the Friars Minors, and abjured the realm.\" There is no account of the Revenues of this House in the Valor of 1535; but it came into lay hands at the dissolution.

In the reign of Edward III, several successive Hermits occur on the Rolls, for they were ushered to their Cell with the same forma lities, of Royal Seal and Patent, as introduced a Dean or Pre bendary of St. Mary Magdalene to the Constable of Bridgnorth or to the Sheriff of the County.

Edwin, the third, was banished the realm and drowned at sea under circumstances which affected the reputation of Athelstan, whose interest in getting rid of him was associated with a question as to his own legitimacy.

We may at least conclude that the Hermitage was of Saxon origin. We have now to speak of some of the principal early tenures which existed within the Borough. We will commence with that which is usually called \" the Fee of Little Brug,\" and was held of the Crown hy petit serjeantry. LITTLE BRUG. This suburb, sometimes also called Southbridge, consisted of two short streets, continuations of Hungary or St. 'Mary's Street, and of Whitburn or Raven Street. These small streets, which lay outside St. Mary's and Whitburn gates, unite in a road, which, passing first to the North-west after wards branches off towards Shrewsbury and Ludlow. Thus the angle formed by these streets (one of which is still called Little Bridge Street) and subtended by the town wall, will have been nearly identical with the \" fee of Little Brug.\" 436 In the early history of this suburb we have again to deal with a Legend, and one which at first seems beyond the reach of any secondary test or investigation. The story is, that during the siege of Brug (by Henry I, in 1102) \" Sir Ralph de Pitchford, one of the King's commanders, behaved himself so gallantly, that Henry granted him an estate in the neigh bourhood, called the Little Brugge, to hold by the service of finding dry wood for the King's great chamber in the Castle as often as he should come there.\" Of all the subjects with which an Antiquary can have to deal, that of ignoring a Legend is the most thankless and distasteful. At the same time we scarcely ever meet with one which can be accepted as true in all its particulars, and it is no unpleasant task, instead of rejecting the whole, to extract from these shadowy hints of the past that element of reality which must have been the foundation of 396*) . The points which require further corroboration are that the first Grantee was Ralph de Pichford, and that he ob tained it in the way stated. 436 I give the Legend in the words of Grose (Antiquities of England and Wales, vol. v, p. 3), which are nearly those of Camden (Gough's Edition, vol. ii, p."], [417, "355 BRIDGNORTH. every bona fide tradition. Equally gratifying is it to find some ex ternal illustration, which, however inadequate to prove the truth of a given Legend, may yet invest it with something of greater credibility than the unwritten memorial could independently command. Thus it is with the Legend before us. \u2014 Ordericus 437 has related, that the three persons entrusted by Earl Robert de Belesme with the defence of Brug Castle were Roger son of Corbet, Robert de Novavilla, and Ulger the Hunter; that Wdliam Pantulf, who negotiated with them as to the surrender of the fortress was their kinsman, and that he promised them 100 librates of land, on behalf of the King, as a reward for such surrender. Now, another, and totally distinct, transaction, of the next Cen tury, shows a probabdity that there was a relationship between the famdy of Pichford and the descendants of Ulger the Hunter.438 Is it not then possible that the service rendered by Ralph de Pichford at this siege may have been of the same kind as Pantulf s, the exertion of some influence, with his presumed kinsman within the Castle, to procure its surrender ? Reserving a detailed account of the famdy of Pichford to a future occasion, I will here offer such extracts only as relate to its tenure of Little Brug. A fragmentary Roll, in the Testa de Nevill, which appears to have been drawn up about 1212, and when Hugh de Pichford had lately been succeeded by a Son Ralph, tells us that the latter then held, in the Hundred of Brug, Little Brug with its appurtenances, by gift of King Henry, grandfather (avi) of King John, by ser vice of finding dry wood, for the Chamber in the Castle of Brug, at the King's coming there.439 The annual value of the tenure is stated at 39s. At the Inquest on the death of Ralph de Pichford, held April 20, 1253, his tenure in capite here, by service of finding fuel (carbones), is said to involve a receipt of 33s. 2d. rent.440 437 Liber, xi, p. 107. his name would suggest, his relationship to Pichford becomes still more probable. 438 The representatives of each contested certain property in Lee Brockhirst under writ of \" mort d' ancestre.\" Moreover it is nearly certain that this same family of Pichford was descended from a great Shropshire Feodary called in Domesday \" Norman Venator,\" who also had a Bro ther \" Roger Venator ;\" and if Ulger Venator were akin to these Brothers, as 439 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. It must be observed that this record does not rightly compute the relationship which King John bore to Henry I, who was his great-grand father (proavus). The statement as to ser vice is repeated in a contemporary Roll in the Red Book of the Exchequer (so. exxiii). 44\u00b0 Escheat, 37 Hen. Ill, No. 56."], [418, "356 BRIDGNORTH. At the Inquisition of 1255, the Jurors of the Borough, in answer to a question as to the various services due to the Castle, stated that \" the Lord of Albrighton had to find fuel for the Castle in respect of his fee of Little Brug.\"441 The then Lord of Albrighton was John de Pichford, Son of the last Ralph, and in minority. In November 1274, the Jurors of the Liberty reported John de Pichford as holding a certain fee in capite within the said Liberty of Brug, but they knew not in what way, or by what warrant, or from what time he so held it.443 In the Inquisitions on the death of John de Pychford, held at Pychford and Albrighton, on April 13, and May 6, 1285, his tenure in capite at Albrighton is mentioned,443 but that of Little Brug is either omitted, or another Inquisition, relating thereto, is lost. At the Salop Assizes, October 1292, the Jurors of Brug exposed themselves to a penalty for not making a due report as to this Serjeantry.444 It however appeared that \" Ralph de Pichford had certain tenants in the v ill of Bruges, of whom he received 30s. per annum, rendering one cart-load of fuel (carbonum) for the fire of the Castle, and one cart-load of hay for the wardrobe, as often as the King should happen to come to the Castle.\" The warranty of this tenure being non-apparent, the Sheriff was ordered to summon the Tenant: and \" Ralph de Pichford came, and well acknowledged the aforesaid service, but said that the King had never passed through the parts of Brugge since the said tenements came into his (Ralph's) hands.\" The Jurors confirmed the statement.445 A few Deeds and other Documents relating to some under tenan cies in this fee, should be quoted. By deed, sans date, but which passed before 1252 :\u2014 1. Henry, son of Adam Doresc, of Little Brug, grants to Agnes, Daughter of Walter le Palmer, 18 acres in Little Brug, in the fields of Brug, paying for him to Sir Ralph de Pichford a chief rent of Is. 6c.., and to him a pair of gloves of id. value, annually. \u2014 441 Rot.

I have already alluded to a source of annual revenue which, in the year 1167, arose to the Crown out of the Borough of Brug, and independently of the annual ferm?57 It was probably from some purpresture, or occupation of a part of the Royal demesne, which had not been taken into account when the ferm of the Borough, or rent payable by the Sheriff, was settled. At Michaelmas, 1167, the Sheriff accounted 23s. 6d. as \" the issues of the land of the Bur gage of Brug.\"458 In the next year the receipt is simdarly described, but it was 26s. 6c.., and is entered under the head of Purprestures?59 In 1169, 24s. 7d. was thus received, and 26s. 8c.. in 1170, and the same sum in every successive year till 1176 inclusive.460 At Michaelmas, 1177, the Sheriff accounted, under the head of purprestures and escheats, for \" 20s. issues of land of the Borough of Brug, before the King gave it to Walter de Linley.\"461 After 454 Haghmon Chartulary at Sundorn, so. 41, and Blakeway MSS. 457 Supra, p. 292. 458 Rot.

We infer that about July 1, 1177, King Henry II granted to Walter de Linley certain Crown-lands in the Borough of Brug which had previously yielded an annual revenue of 2 merks. Before the end of the century, the whole or a great part462 of this land had passed to a female, variously described as Sibil de Linley and Sibil de Brocton. What may have been her relationship to Walter de Linley I will not here conjecture, but her interest in Brocton arose under feoffment of Richard de Linley, who therefore may have succeeded Walter in this land at Brug, and transmitted the same to Sibd. She, in whatever way of succession, became doubly a tenant in capite of the Crown, and, as such, her marriage was in the King's gift. Before Michaelmas, 1190, she fined with the King in a sum of 3 merks, \"for license of marrying herself.463 This license of course involved the privilege of remaining single, and such I imagine to have been Sibil's application thereof, for within nine years fbdowing she granted the whole of her lands in Brocton and in Brug to Lideshall Abbey. She further bestowed her body for burial in that house. This grant was included in King John's general confirmation to Lilleshall, dated 31 Aug. 1199.464 It is also mentioned in the con firmation of Pope Honorius III (1216-1227), to that Abbey.466 Such were the circumstances under which the Canons of Lilies hall obtained their first interest within the Borough of Brug, an interest which in 1255 was represented by the receipt of 30 shillings annual rent.466 . - 1 Their possessions here were greatly increased by their acquisition of the Hospital of St. John in the reign of Edward IV;467 but the 462 I use this qualification with refer ence to a previous statement (p. 115, note 49), from which it would appear that the Linley interests in or near Bridg north did not all centre in Sibil or devolve to Lilleshall. inspeximus of Richard II (Rot.

TENURE OF THE WHITE NUNS OF BREWOOD. This House was favoured with the patronage, and perhaps occa sionally with the presence of King John.469 Among other things he granted to the Nuns a weir, called \" Withlakeswere,\" in the River Severn, near to Brug. About the year 1225, Alditha, Prioress of Brewode, and her Convent enfeoffed Henry Fitz Robert of Brug in one half of this weir, reserving an annual rent of 5s.470 Cecdia, another Prioress, granted the other moiety to the same Feoffee, and at a similar rent.470 That the grants were nearly contemporary appears from the same witnesses having attested each, viz. Sir Henry d'Aldithley, William Pantulf, and Walter de Hugford. It would appear that the Abbey of Shrewsbury later in the 13th century acquired some tenant right in this Weir, for two deeds remain on the Chartulary, by one of which Wdliam de Brug, son of Richard the Fisherman, quit-claims to the Abbey, all right in the fishery called Withlakeswere. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir Albinus de la Rode, Andrew de Northley, Symon de Sabrina.471 The other deed is a grant to the same Abbey of ad his right in the said Weir by John, Son of John Fisherman, of Brug. \u2014 Wit nesses: William de Cantrey, Henry de Arnleg, William Bolding.473 The Inquisition of 1255 registers the Nuns of Brewood as in receipt of 6s. 8d. rent within this Borough, and their income ap pears like that of the Knights Templars and Hospitallers to have been unassessable to the King's Tallages.473 Probably, also, it was 470 Salop Chartulary, No. 376. 471 Ibidem, No. 143.

Their Tenants were life-tenants, and would not scott with the Burgesses for the trade carried on in the said houses.480 This, and, it may be added, the former immunity arose from the chartered privileges of this once powerful Order.

In the first instance, he had put in bail for his appearance, Philip de Petra being his surety in the sum of 20_. When however he did not appear, Walter, his Son, compounded the matter, by fine of 15 merks, which covered the bail, and released Hamo from all obliga tion to appear. The Abbot of Buildwas was surety for the latter fine. It was at the same time stated, that Hamo, who must have now been an old man, had fallen from his horse, and that it was not possible to carry him to the Assizes.492 How long he survived these events is a question, but it seems to be he, rather than his son Hamo, who attests a deed already quoted, and which must have passed in or shortly before 1259. 493 He has already appeared as having served, at least thrice, as Pro vost of the Borough. His house, in the High Street, was separated from that of his brother Walter, by an intervening messuage, which was sold by Robert Fitz Walter Frut to Robert Tinctor for 14 merks, a good sum at the time of the transaction, which must have been between the years 1251 and 1256.

It was for trespass with his hounds, and his Nephew, Master Walter le Palmer, was amerced in double the sum for a like offence.496 At the County Assizes, January, 1256, he stands first of the Borough Jurors, and seems to have been unimplicated in the dis graceful affairs which affected so many chief persons of the Town, and, amongst others, his own relations.

His Son, simply called Roger Fitz Hamon, or Roger Hamund, occurs in several deeds later in the Century, and in one, dated Feb. 25, 1294. (1) Master Walter le Palmer, Clerk, was another son of Hamo le Palmer, Senior. He, too, appears in life, some time before his Father's decease. On April 30, 1250, a King's writ enjoins the Sheriff of Salop to recover and produce certain chattels of one Robert de Baudak, who had, \" for larceny, abjured the realm.\" A sdver drinking-cup, of 12 shillings value, is specified as in posses sion of Master Walter, Son of Hamo de Brug.516 In 1254 he had been amerced 40 merks by Justices of the Forest for trespass of his hounds.517 In January, 1256, he appears, as before related, guilty of murder.518 At the same time he was acquitted of disseizing Isabeda le Caugi (Gaugi), Jane, Julia, and Florence, her Sisters, of a tenement in Brug, and the latter pro nounced in misericordid ,- but they were pardoned any amercement as being under age.519 Under the Manor of Church Stretton, at the same Assizes, Master Walter de Bruges is returned as offering 100... fine, to be under plevin, his surety being the Abbot of Buddwas.620 This was probably in connexion with his first-named offence. Again, at these Assizes, Edith, widow of William Turner, impleaded Master Walter de Briges, for a third part, of 30 acres, in Diddlebury, as her dower. Walter called Hugh de Beckbury to warranty. The latter came forward with such warranty, and proved that the Plaintiff's husband had been hung for felony at Coventry. This was fatal to her claim.531 On the whole, at Michaelmas, 1256,522 Walter le Palmer is entered on the Pipe Rod as having owed \u00a35. for his fine for plevin, 30 merks (balance of his amercement for trespass with hounds), 15 merks \" for his fine for transgression \" (really for compounding as to the 516 Fines, vol. ii, p. 76. 517 Rot.

The whole of these debts were paid, before the Sheriff closed the year's account at the Exchequer, the Abbots of Buildwas and Shrewsbury having been the Debtor's Sureties. His occurrence in 1260 has been already noticed.523 In Easter Term, 1263, he acknowledges, in the law-courts at Westminster, a debt of 8 merks, as due from him to Jane, widow of Hugh de Beckbury.524 The fine, levied on the same day, between the parties shows the said debt to have been for some land in Old bury. It has already been set forth.525 Later in the century he occurs as purchasing various parcels of land in the Manor of Astley Abbots, from Adam, son of Matilda English (Anglic\u00e6). In the troubled times of which we are speaking (1264-5), Master Walter le Palmer's political sympathies were not those of his famdy or native town. His previous antagonism with the law was of a kind which is found not unfrequently to generate sentiments of disloyalty. \u2014 In the year 1266 or 1267, and before the famous \"dictum de Kenilworth\" was issued, Roger de Somery and Walter de St. Omer were commissioned, as Justiciars in the County of Salop, to settle amercements and fines on those whose lands had been granted away, or seized, by the Crown, because of the late disturbances. The business of these Justiciars in Shropshire was very trifling; indeed, the total disloyalty of the County may be \"measured by an arrear of amercements (viz. \u00a3 17. 3s. id.) which the Sheriff codected, and accounted for at the Exchequer, after the said Justiciars left the district. Master \" Walter le Paumer\" forestalled some prospective and undefined liabilities, in regard to his late conduct, by negotiating a composition with these Justiciars. He proffered a fine of 40s. \" to have the good-will of the King,\"528 and it was a prudent measure. \u2014 The \" dictum de Kenilworth,\" which proposed to classify and punish all the late treasonable practices, according to a fixed ratio, was meanwhile put into operation.

This amercement identifies Master Walter le Palmer as a rebel of the second class,627 that is, as one who had taken open part with the late Earl of Leicester, at some time or other, though he had not, like one or two greater men, persisted in insolent defiance of the King after the battle of Evesham. But the wily Clerk evaded the operation of the \" dictum de Kenil worth\" altogether. He pleaded his previous fine of 40s. as settling all his misdemeanours in question, and paid it. This plea was allowed too at the Exchequer, after reference to the \" Roll of Amercements before Wdliam de St. Omer.\"528 Among Pleas summoned before the King, at Salop, in August, 1267, it appeared that the Prioress of the White Nuns of Brewood did not prosecute a suit of novel disseizin, which she had instituted against Master Walter le Paumer, of Brug. The Defendant had acknowledged that 18 pence annual rent was due from him to the said Prioress, which, I presume, involved the question at issue.629 On June 3, 1272, a fine was levied at Warwick, \" between Master Walter de Brigge complainant (querentem), and Hugh de Eudon and Alice his wife, defendants (impedientes) , of 5 acres in Brigge, whereof was plea of warranty. The Defendants acknowledged the right of the Complainant as of their own gift. To hold &c. at a rent of 2c?. payable to themselves, and rendering services due to the Lord of the fee. For this Walter gave 8 merks.630 The lands of Master Walter le Palmer, in different localities in Brug, are mentioned in two deeds of the year 1277 ; and a third deed, which speaks of him as if deceased, will have passed within fifteen years of that date. His possessions are mentioned as lying in the fields of Brug generally, in the fields towards Taswood and towards the Hok, in Diddlebury, Oldbury, and Astley Abbots.

The second deed (of date about 1296) shows the Abbot of Buildwas, as Master Alan's Executor, selling the same messuage, as before stated.

His tenure in the Low Town, by transfer of the seigneury of which he became a tenant of Haughmond Abbey, has already been mentioned.636 On 6 March, 1258, Giles de Erdington is deputed to try a suit of novel disseizen, which Philip de Roulle and his wife had against John del Chastell, about a tenement in Bruges.637 This suit seems to have led to a final Concord, at Westminster, whereby, on July 8, 1259, \"Philip de Roweley and Isabella, his wife, conceded, as of their own gift, to John de Chastel de Brugg and Alice, his wife, 19 acres inNortleg (Nordley),Dunfowe, Brugg, and Aldebyre (Oldbury), whereof had been a plea of warranty. \u2014 To hold to John and Alice and their heirs, of Phibp and Isabella and the heirs of Isabella, at \\d. rent, and services due to the chief lords.

That which I have to say of a fourth Brother, Alan de Castello, and of their Sister Alice, first the wife, and then the widow, of Reginald le Gaugy, shall, as aflbrding the chief points of interest in the story of this famdy, be told under one head. Reginald le Gaugy, who had married Alice, sister of John de Castedo, was a person of some property in the Borough. He had a house in the High Street, lands in the fields towards Oldbury and Tasley, and in the fields of Brug generally. Having served the office of Provost with Hamo le Palmer, he was murdered at Worfield, in the year 1250 or 1251, leaving a widow, a son, apparently of full age, and four daughters under age. 541 Supra, p. 113, where the deed sup posed to be \"about 1221 \" should perhaps be put later.

A subsequent deed by Henry de Glazeley will have transferred his interests to Nicholas Palmer, for, by indenture \u2014 542 This deed is the first of three conse cutive charters which involve some points of interest connected with former subjects.

In the course of the year 1251, Robert, son of the deceased, challenged (appedavit) Giles de Norfolk, a Clerk, and others with this murder. A precept issued from the courts at Westminster, on Nov. 2, 1251, ordering the Sheriff of the County to send this appeal before the King's Council, for further hearing.64* It would appear that this removal was at the instance of Alice le Gaugy, widow of the deceased, whom his Son Robert had included in his challenge as an accessory. From statements made by Alice to the Council, the challenge was declared null, and Roberti pro nounced in misericordid?u His amercement (half a merk) for a \" false challenge\" appears charged against him on the Pipe Roll of 1254.646 But this apparent disposal of the whole question seems to have been by no means final. On November 2, 1252, \"Alice who was wife of Reginald de Gaugi gave the King 1 merk of gold (equal to \u00a36. 13s. id. of the then currency) for having pardon as to the death of her husband, of which she was appealed. \" She had paid the fine to Peter de Chaceporc and was quit.\"516 This fine edcited the following Royal Patent, dated at Sandeford, 7 November, 1252. \u2014 \" Henry d : g : &c.

At the same Assizes (1256) the vill of Worfield was amerced 1 1 shillings for \" not making pursuit,\" after the murder of Reginald le Gaugy. Also \u2014 543 Placita apud Westm., 36 Hen.

The two former, being Clerks, pleaded their privilege as such, and were delivered over to the Spiritual Power; the Jury having first pronounced them to have been Accessories (consenti entes morti) . John de Castello (Alice le Gaugy's Brother) came and took his trial, and was found \" not gudty.\" Furthermore, the Jurors of Brug recorded at these Assizes, that Alan Fitz Widiam (another of the Brothers of Alice le Gaugy), having for some second offence been arrested and imprisoned in the Castle of Brug, had obtained a King's writ, whereby he was given in charge to twelve Sureties, who were bound to produce him before the King's Justices, when in eyre. Now (January, 1256) they produced him not. And so those Sureties (viz. Walter Aurifaber, Widiam Bonami, Roger Lamberd, Robert Faber, Robert Tinctor, Nicholas le Porter, Nicholas le Sallowe, Almaric Tinctor, Stephen Knotte, Wdliam Fitz Richard le Pescur, Roger Feyrchild, and Richard Bacun) were pronounced in misericordid. Trial was, however, held on the absent Defendant. He (Alan Fitz William) was found to have been guilty of Reginald le Gaugy's murder, but it was also given in evidence that he had crossed the sea to Ireland, and was there dead, according to report. The second offence for which Alan Fitz Wddam should have taken his trial at these Assizes must now be detailed. His Sister Alice le Gaugy, being herein also accused as an accom plice, her trial will better give the facts than any statement as to her absent or deceased Brother. She was charged with having entertained (pro receptacione) Alan de Castedo, her Brother, who was a Robber. \" Alan,\" it was said, \" left her house with the intention of committing the robbery in question. He murdered the Lady of Shustock (Warwicksh.) and then returned to the house of his Sister ; so she was suspected of taking part.\"647 \" Alice being hereupon asked in what way she chose to acquit herself of this charge, said that she dared not, and would not, put herself upon any Inquisition or Jury.\" \u2014 So the Court ordered her back to prison. \u2014 547 Assizes at Salop, 40 Hen.

However, whde the Justices were apparently still at Shrewsbury, Alice came forward and offered a fine of 10 merks to have .' a good Inquisition whether she were guilty of the entertainment of Alan her Brother, who had been attached for robbery at Schuttestok.\"648 \"And 12 Jurors of the Hundred of Munslow with 12 of the Hundred of Overes, said that Alice was ' not guilty,' but that this charge was made against her by instigation (per abbettum) of Richard, Son of Hamo Palmer, of Bruges, and his friends, by reason of certain strifes which had been between said Richard and Wdliam the Brother of Alice.\" Further, at the same Assizes, \" P.oger Fitz Henry, of Brug, William de Gardino, Amaric Tinctor, and Henry Fitz Amice, accused of robbery and the entertainment of robbers, appeared to defend themselves and put themselves upon a Jury of the country, which pronounced them ' not guilty.' \" Also John le Teinturer fined 40. . \" to be under plevin, because he was infirm and might not be carried.\" These statements, together with those which have previously been made as to the famdy of Palmer, wdl show that at these Assizes (of January, 1 256) every principal name in the Borough of Brug, was implicated in, or suspected of, some enormous crime. It is singular that Almaric le Teynturer (as Badiff), William le Palmer, Henry Fitz Avice, and William Bonamy (as Jurors) served on the same occasion.649 The disorganization produced in a smad town by such a general complicity in real or suspected guilt, and by such adversity of interests and natural affinities, cannot well be over-imagined. But, to return to our immediate subject : \u2014 I suppose that at this period Robert, Son of Reginald le Gaugy, the accuser of his Mother (or Step Mother) Alice, was deceased, leaving Alice and her four daughters (now under age) the sole representatives of the family of Reginald. We have already seen the same four daughters vainly impleading Master Walter le Palmer for \" disseizing them of a tenement in Brug,\" and this at these very Assizes of January, 1256. 66\u00b0 54s This fine is entered on the Sheriffs' Roll for the two years ending Michaelmas, 1259, as one of 10 merks, due, from Alice widow of Reginald le Gaugy, for \" having an Inquisition under pledge of William Bonamy and John de Castro.\" (Rot.

All that I shall further say on the subject is, that 5 separate Charters still exist, whereby, at or about this period, Isabel, Jane, and Floria (Florence), three of the said daughters, sell several parcels of their lands to Walter Palmer, Burgess, of Brug; that Jane, in a sixth charter, sells a parcel of land to Roger Tinctor ; and that Alice, their Mother, in four other charters, releases her claim of dower in the premises conveyed by her daughters' deeds, or else sells independently and on her own account. In one of the latter cases, and in the event of her non-abdity to warrant a certain piece of land in the \" fields of Brug\" she vouches as a contingent security \" the house which she had in High Street between the house of Hamo Palmer and Richard Bacun.\" Her seal attached to one of these deeds proves her pedigree.

Pip. 40 Hen. Ill, Salop) ; but it does not appear on what specific account. One Alice de Gaugi, and Walter her Son, occur in Staffordshire, in April, 1269 (Fines, vol. ii, p. 486). If she be the"], [444, "382 BRIDGNORTH. The Barbican which in the close of King John's reign was added to Bridgnorth Castle, interfered with the private rights of Alan Fitz Robert. I have already quoted King Henry Ill's order for compensation of the said Alan, which issued, on July 4, 1221, to the Sheriff of the County.562 It would seem that the King's order was not at once attended to ; for when, in November of the same year, the Justices in eyre came to Shrewsbury, they issued a second precept, in simdar terms, to the same Sheriff (the Earl of Chester) .653 These same Assizes also interested Alan Fitz Robert in another way. Henry Harshonail sued him for a messuage in Brug. The Defendant requiring view threof, the cause was adjourned to the morrow of St. Hdary (Jan. 14, 1222), when the same Justices proposed to be at Warwick. On the said day, at Warwick, Alan Fitz Robert essoigned himself; and a further day was given ; viz. the quinzaine of Easter, to both parties.664 However, they seem to have settled the matter sooner ; for by fine, at Warwick, dated the same day (Jan. 14) Ralph Horsnad, Plaintiff, remits his claim on a messuage in Bruges whereof was suit-at-law, to Alan Fitz Robert, tenant thereof, the latter paying 2 merks.665 This will show Alan Fitz Robert to have been possessed of other property within the Borough, besides that for which he was entitled to compensation. He was, in fact, largely concerned in the affairs of the Town, often in attendance at the Borough Court, and once he occurs in the office of Pr\u00e6tor, as before stated.556 In 1231, Alan Fitz Avice de Brug appears as Surety for the fine of Widiam de Aldenham already noticed.657 He was the same person with Alan Fitz Robert. It does not appear when Alan obtained his promised compensation; but, at Michaelmas, 1232, the land which had been \"Alan Fitz Avice's,\" before the Castle Gate, had been leased by the Crown to another for three years past.658 Alan's equivalent was given him 652 Supra, p. 255. 653 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

Henry Ill's Charter is as follows : \u2014 \" Henry, d . g. &c.

On Nov. 12, 1240, a fine was levied at Salop562 between Robert, Clerk, Plaintiff, and Henry Fitz Robert, tenant, of 4 acres of land and 8 acres of wood in Bruges and Wurdefeud (Worfield) whereof was an assize of \" mort d'ancestre.\" Henry acknowledged the right of Robert, whereon Robert, at request of Henry, conceded the premises to Roger, Son of Henry, who was to pay an annuity of 1 merk to Robert for life, and then to hold the same, in fee and inheritance, \" of the chief Lords.\" In 1249, Henry Fitz Robert is entered on the Pipe Roll as having paid the annual/erw of 12c?. on 8 acres of land.663 Again, in 1251, he discharges the same for the preceding and the current year, and continues the payment annually till the year 1255 inclu sive, when the entry again ceases.564 As Henry Fitz Robert he appears fifth Juror on the Inquest of 1255,565 and as Henry Fitz Avice sat as seventh Juror of the Borough quer but the jurors knew not the time when the tenure originated. (Rot. Sund. vol. ii, p. 88.) The tenure was curious, the only one in the Borough whereupon a money-rent, payable by an individual, had been reserved by the Crown. This Robert, Clerk, may possibly be the same with Robert Fitz Aviee of the pedigree, and so Brother of Henry Fitz Robert. If so, he was dead in 1251, having been possessed of some ground in High Street, of which, in 1273, Henry Fitz Roger was the owner. 559 Carta Antiqu\u0153 apud Turrim Land. PP. 29, and Calend. Rot.

The succession of his Son (in the absence of any payment on account of this annual ferm) was not recognised on the Pipe- Rolls.670 The latter, Roger Fitz Henry, occurs as a witness of Borough deeds in 1265, 1273, and 1277, in which last year he was a holder of land near the Standelf, as appears by a deed already recited.571 With him we dismiss the subject. 666 Supra, p. 306. that the Clerk of the Pipe being mainly attentive to matters of revenue, and there fore looking chiefly to the due entry of each proper item, in some form or other, was contented to copy from former Rolls tlie names of several Accountants.

We now proceed with those Manors which, on the said dismem berment of Alnodestreu Hundred, went to constitute the newer Hundreds of Munslow and Brimstree. The Manors allotted to Munslow Hundred were but two, Broseley and Willey.1 Each of these, like Deuxhill already noticed, was, in the third place and in time of Richard I, transferred to the Liberty of Wenlock, then first created. In that Franchise they have ever since remained. And first of \u2014 Brnsdep* In determining the etymology of this name it is probable that neither the Domesday word (Bosle), nor the one now in use (Broseley) will afford so safe a guide as that current in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, viz. Burwardsley. This I take to be nearly the Saxon name, unmutilated by Norman scribes, and unabbreviated by that Anglo-Saxon genius of language which came to eschew a multiplicity of letters as much as a redundancy of words. The name Burhredsley (Sax. B_.pl_pe_j_ea3) would be perfectly intelligible as the lea}, or district, possessed by some Saxon Burhred, 1 I do not place Linley or Caughley in this category, because they were not Domesday Manors. 1"], [494, "2 BROSELEY. and with this attempt at an etymology, I leave the question. Domesday notices the place briefly and as follows : \u2014 \" The same Helgot holds Bosle. Gethne held it (in time of King Edward) and was a free man. Here is i hide geldable. There is arable land (sufficient) for n ox-teams. In demesne is one (such team), and (there are) un serfs, and mi boors and i radman with i team. In time of King Edward, the value (of the Manor) was 16*. Id., now it is 12s. He (Helgot) found it waste.\" l I cannot confirm my identification of Bosle with Broseley, by showing any interest as possessed in the latter by Helgot's suc cessors. I find no evidence of this kind; but the question of identity is not thus to be determined, for Broseley was not the only Domesday manor of Helgot which passed out of his ordinary succession : moreover it became absorbed in the Liberty of Wen lock, a circumstance which is known to have effaced all, or nearly all, posterior hints of the original tenure of other Manors. I shall presently show that Broseley was long afterwards rated as a Manor of i hide (the Domesday measurement).2 I can say nothing of the place during the half century following Domesday, but some circumstances, to which I shall allude more particularly in the sequel, have induced me to think that the Lords of Burwardsley in the next succeeding period, were descended from that Warin de Metz who appears to have acquired a considerable influence in Shropshire during the reign of Henry I. It is well known that whatever in the way of lands and honours that monarch had to bestow was usually given to men of little previous notoriety, and probably with less regard to any claims of descent than with a view to strengthen the influence of the crown. Henry's favourites were however persons of ability and conduct, and the allegiance which the King won by a free gene rosity in giving to new men, seems to have been of a truer stamp than that which resulted from his general character for impartiality and wisdom. Of the number thus advanced I take Warin de Metz of Lorrain to have been one. The mere error by which this Warin de Metz has been identified with Warin the Bald, the first Norman Sheriff Domesday, so. 258, b. 1. tempore Regis Johannis, No. 75, m. 12 recto.) This is nearly the Domesday or thography of Broseley, and serves to settle the question of identity. : An attorney of Petronilla, wife of Warner de Will-ley, in 1204, is written as \" Bernard de Bosleie.\" (Placita de Banco"], [495, "3 BROSELEY. of Shropshire, has long ago been pointed out, and needs no refu tation here.3 Most of what we know, or rather read, about Warin de Metz, originates with those curious Chronicles which compiled from the songs of Trouveres, profess to give account of him and his suc cessors, the Fitz Warins of Whittington and Alberbury. These Chronicles, besides that portion of them which common sense rejects at once as fabulous, are replete with anachronisms, contradictions, and improbabilities. Nevertheless, like all other legends, they have their value, and it is our business to extract whatever element of truth they may contain. We must accept all that is reasonable in itself and which we cannot disprove by better evidence. We must not only accept but greatly prize whatever is confirmed by independent testimony. Now the facts, which may be selected from these Fitz-Warin Chronicles for our present purpose are these, \u2014 that Warin de Metz lived in the time of Henry I,4 \u2014 that his marriage allied him with the family of Peverel, then very powerful in Shropshire and in the Marches, \u2014 that he was related to the Dukes (or Earls) of Little Brittany, consequently to the family of Le Strange, whose progenitor Guy is represented indeed as coming to. find ultimately settling in, England by suggestion of Warin. Accepting thus much as fact, I now hazard a conjecture, bolder than any which I have yet ventured upon in these pages and in justification of which I can refer to no previous Writer. My supposition, which must be tested by the sequel, is, that either Warin de Metz himself, or William his younger son, acquired this Lordship of Broseley in time of Henry I, \u2014 perhaps by exchange, 3 Dugdale himself is responsible for this error, which, in a general inquiry like his, was a most likely one to arise. (Tide Paronage, vol. i, p. 443.) Finding, from the Salop Chartulary, that Warin and Fulcoius were early Sheriffs of the County, and finding, from the Fitz-Warin Chro nicles, that Warin de Metz and Fulk his son, were men of great trust and repute, in an era nearly as early, Dugdale na turally identified one pair with the other. This identity is uniformly ignored by Mr. Blakeway, when noticing any of the indi viduals concerned, and in one instance (Sheriffs, p. 31) Dugdale's error is obvi- ously the one alluded to. Mr. Wright, in his Sistory of Ludlow (p. 83), has speci fied another of Dugdale's omissions, in his account of the Fitz- Warins ; but the whole question of their descent requires that re-examination which I hope to offer on the earliest occasion. 4 The Chronicle says that he came into notice before the death of William the Conqueror, and implies that he survived the accession of Stephen. These two data of course involve the third fact, of his living in the time of Henry I ; but I by no means advance them botli as fully correct in themselves."], [496, "4 BROSELEY. perhaps under a partial forfeiture of the previous Lord, perhaps by feoffment of the then Baron of Holgate, though the seigneural interest of the latter can be traced no further. The Archidiaconal Chapter which, about a.d. 1115, sat at Castle Holgate under presidency of Richard Bishop of London, has been already alluded to.5 Among the fourteen lay witnesses who attended, were two whom it is to our purpose to mention here, viz. Hamo Peverel and Warinus. The subject which engaged the Chapter's attention should also be remembered. \u2014 It was the Parochial jurisdiction of Wenlock Priory, and the frequent attestations of subsequent Lords of Burwardsley, which appear in deeds concerning that House, will render it possible that the Warin, who attested about a.d. 1115, so attested with reference to some similar connection. At the same time we must mark the concurrent appearance of this Warin with Hamo Peverel and with the Viceroy of Henry I. For the sake of showing my hypothesis to be free from chrono logical objections I mu3t now notice the first occurrence of the sons of Warin de Metz.6 Of these, Roger appears to have been the eldest, Fulk the second, and eventually chief of the family ; and William, if rightly assumed to have been son of Warin, will have been younger than either. The documents which suggest this view are as follows \u2014 A charter whereby Walcheline Maminoht (one of Hamo Peverel's coheirs) between the years 1136 and 1141 exchanged lands with ffie^Aiyjpt of Shrewsbury is attested by Roger Fitz Warin.7 \u2014 A charter by which the same Walcheline, about the year 1145 granted Bradford Mill to Haughmond Abbey is attested by Roger Fitz Warin and Fulk his Brother.8 Of the presumed third Brother, William, we do not hear so early, but when he at length occurs it is chiefly in connection with the coheirs of the Peverels. \u2014 An act of restitution to Salop Abbey by Hugh de Dover and 6 Vol. I, pp. 217, 223. his son, Fulk Fitz-Warin I, who mar ried Hawise de Dynan. It was Warm's grandson (Fulk II) who espoused that coheiress. 6 With the same view of preserving a clear chronology, I should also notice two mis-statements of the Fitz-Warin Chro nicles. The first is, that Warin de Metz married as late as the accession of Owen Gwyned to the sceptre of North Wales, i. e. after 1137 : the second is, that it was 7 Salop Chartulary, No. 28. 8 Haughmond Chartulai-y, so. 39 ; and Harl.

I concede that William Fitz Warin may hold and have his assarts in Salopesire and may turn them to his profit at his own pleasure. Witness \u2014 The Chancellor at Faleise.\" n It was about this time (but specifically in 1170 or 1171) that Fulk Fitz-Warin I, the presumed elder brother of William, died. We are also fortunate in having proof that William was ere long succeeded at Broseley by another Warin. We thus complete a parallel between the two presumed brothers. This Warin, the successor and almost surely the son of William, was a person of note in his day. The earliest mention I find of him is in a deed which passed while Peter was Prior of Wenlock, i.e. between the years 1169 and 1176. This deed is attested by Warin de Burwardesl' and Philip his brother.13 About September 1176, the three Justices appointed to that circuit under the Statutes of Northampton, visited Shropshire. Amongst others they inflicted a fine of two merks on \" Warin de Burwarley, because he was present when excuse was made about the death of John.\" 13 A murder, I suppose, had been hushed up by the laxity of some manorial or provincial court or jury which should have investigated the case more fully, and of which Warin was a member. At Michaelmas 1177, Warin de Burewardesley appears as one of those who had been amerced by the King himself for trespass on the Royal Forests. His fine of ten merks, when compared with his position and that of others more heavily punished, indi- 9 Salop Chartulary, No. 30. is doubtless Thomas k Becket, and so the 10 Ibidem, No. 31. date of the precept probably May 1162. 12 Wenlock Register at Willey, so. 7. 13 Rot.

He discharged half the debt in the current year and half in the year following.1* I now come to a most important entry relating to this Manor, the appearance of which on the Staffordshire and not the Shrop shire Pipe-Roll is remarkable ; but such transfers are by no means unprecedented. During a recent visit of the King's Justices a fine had been negotiated by Fulko son of Fulko Fitz Warin, which he had paid before Michaelmas 1183. He had proffered \"one merk that he might prosecute in the King's Court (instead of before the Justices) the suit which he had concerning one hide of land in Burewardes ley.\"15 We have here not only a satisfactory correspondence between the Domesday measurement of Bosle and the subsequent contents of Burwardsley ; but, according to my view, hitherto presumptive, we have the son and heir of the elder brother suing his first cousin, the son and heir of the younger brother, for his inheritance. We shall see presently that the probable ground of this suit was heirship, i. e. that the parties derived their claims from a common ancestor. I have no evidence of the result of this suit, but what may be gathered from subsequent events. About this time Warin de Burward' attests a charter which has been already cited as relating to Corve (near Monk Hopton).16 As Warin de Burwardesley or Burwardele he stands last witness of two charters which passed somewhat later in the century, and by which Isabel de Say, Lady of Clun, and her third husband William Botterell'ensured her extensive grants to Wenlock Priory.17 At, Michaelmas 1188, Warin de Burewardesley had been fined a merk by Justices of the forest, \" for building a mill without regard,\" i. e. without view and license of the proper authorities.18 14 Rot.

During the captivity of King Richard, Warin de Burwardsley was one of those who aided in the treasonable designs of John Earl of Moreton, nay, he was actually in the employment of that Prince at Nottingham. On the surrender of that Castle in March 1194, he would appear to have beeu of the garrison, and his manors and effects were seized into the King's hands in consequence. But the records (admirably consistent with and illustrative of the history of this eventful period) shall tell their own story. \u2014 At Michaelmas 1194, the Custos of the King's Escheats, under the head of \" Salopescire \" renders account of the following re ceipts, viz \u2014 of \u00a33. 8s. 6d., of the ferm of Warin's Burwardeley, for half a year ; \u2014 of .610. for the corn of the same vill which had been sold; \u2014 of 17s. of the ferm of the same Warin's Bradelea (Bradley near Broseley); \u2014 and of 6*. 8d. for hay of thesame vill which had been sold.19 At the same period (Michaelmas 1194) \"Adam de Beissin accounted five merks for pardon, whereas he had married Mabel le Strange of Burwardesley without the King's license and for having his lands in Shropshire in peace.\" He had paid the whole fine.20 This requires some explanation. Adam de Beysin of Billingsley, Wrickton, Walkerslow, and Ashfield, the last three of which he held in capite of the Crown, had married Mabel eldest daughter and eventually coheir of Warin de Burwardsley. This being without license he was liable to fine and forfeiture, not because he had married an heiress or ward of the Crown, which was not yet Mabel's condition, but because he himself was a tenant in capite. But a still more important hint is contained in this Exchequer entry, \u2014 Mabel daughter of Warin de Burwardsley is called \" Mabel le Strange.\" This, in conjunction with our previous assumptions, reminds us of the inferences drawn from the Fitz Warin Chronicle, viz. that Warin de Metz was not only akin to the family of Le Strange, but might himself be well described by a name, which, if I mistake not, was originally borne by or applied to more than one family. Very shortly after Michaelmas 1194, Warin de Burwardsley redeemed his forfeited lands, for the Escheator who accounted at 19 \" Escheat-Roll of Divers Counties,\" I inserted in Rot. Pip. 6 Ric.

Moreover among the fines which had been yffered and accepted by the King since \" his return from Almagne \" was one to the following effect \u2014 \" Warin de Burwordesle renders account of 20 merks for having the King's goodwill and his land, who was with Earl John in Nottingham Castle. He has paid it and is quit.\" At the same period (Michaelmas 1195), Warin de Burewordesle is entered as owing 2^ merks, a further fine which he had proffered \" for having trial about half a knight's fee in Rowlton and Ellar dine, against Griffin, son of Hereverth (so written for Gervase). Warin's pledge was John le Strange.21 The whole of this fine was not discharged till Michaelmas, 1201. Here again we are reminded of the connection between Warin and the family of Le Strange ; and once more, when, some years later, John le Strange made a grant, in Cheswardine, to Haugh mond Abbey, Warin de Burward' was a witness.22 This is not the place to hazard any surmise about the grounds of Warin de Burwardsley's claim on Rowton and Ellardine. Suffice it to say, that those two Manors, together with Sutton and Brock ton, constituted the Serjeantry of Griffin, son of Gervase Goch, who had in the previous year (1194) succeeded to his estates. Griffin's title was questioned in another instance than this, and in that other instance he is known to have compounded the adverse claim of Ralph de Sanford by a grant of land iu Brockton.

A Roll of Crown Tenures in the County of Stafford, which appears to have been taken in 1211, records that \" Warin de Burewardcsley holds the Manor of Esseleg by service of the fifth part of a knight's fee, for which he is liable to do ward 21 Rot.

The Castle, to which thc service specified was due, was that of Shrawardine, and at the period in question it was a Royal Castle. Within the three years ending Michaelmas 1212, Warin de Burewardesleg had fined with the King in a sum of 20 merks, but for what purpose we cannot say. \u2014 The fine had been paid. Within the same period, and probably towards its close, he had been amerced in a similar sum of 20 merks, for a breach of the forest laws. Of this heavy penalty he had paid three parts, and the King (John) had excused the rest.26 I can say little more of Warin de Burwardsley, except that about 1 196 he attested a composition about Priors Ditton Church already noticed; about 1200, a grant by William Mauveysin of Ridware (Staffordshire) ; about 1201, a grant by William Fitz Alan (n) to Richard de Leighton ; and between 1205 and 1211, a grant by Ralph de Sanford which concerned land at Brockton, near Sutton.27 A very usual witness with Warin de Burwardsley was his neighbour Warner de Wililey, and the appearances of both indicate a high position in the County Court, if not some more specific and official connexion. I find no later notice of Warin de Burwardsley than that above mentioned, in the year 1212. He had then been in possession of his estates nearly forty years, and he certainly did not survive many more. At his death (between 1212 and 1220), he left two sons, Philip and Roger, and three daughters, Mabel, Alice and Margery. Philip de Burwardsley, the heir of Warin, occurs first as having fined with King Henry III for a weekly Market at \"Eist\" (Ashley). The Record of the Fine does not seem to be preserved, but on May 20, 1220 (the King being at Shrewsbury), Philip paid by hand of Walter de Saint Owen, a palfrey for this privilege. Accordingly a writ close dated 2d Oct. 1220, orders the Barons of the Exchequer to discharge the debt from their accounts.38 At the County Assizes, Nov. 1221, William Fitz Richard and Testa de Nevill, so. 249. contain the entry we are in need of. 26 Rot.

Emma his wife, who had arraigned an assize of novel disseizin against Philip de Burwardesley and William le Bretun concerning a tenement in Wenlock and warranty of a Charter, withdrew their suit, receiving 20s. from the latter.29 In 1230, Philip de Burwardsley appears in the Courts at West minster as being sued by Fulk Fitz Warin (the third of that name, as I discover) for his inheritance, or so much thereof as had not been involved in the litigation of their respective Fathers nearly fifty years before. The steps which were taken in this new suit should be given as they occur on the Rolls. On the Quinzaine of St. Hilary (Feb. 17) 1230, Fulco Fitz Warin names Henry de Waneting as his Attorney against Philip de Burwardel.30 On June 23, 1230, the cause came ou. \u2014 \" Fulco Fitz Warin, by his Attorney sues Philip de Burwardel for 2 carrucates of land in Edulvescote (Arlscot), and 2 carrucates in Bradelegh (Bradley), both in Shropshire ; also for 2 carrucates iu Offelegh (so written for Ashley), Staffordshire. \u2014 Philip asks view of the whole. The cause is adjourned to the Octaves of St. Martin,\" (Nov. 18, 1230) .31 I can trace nothing of this suit for many succeeding Terms, but on July 8, 1233, I find that the cause was still standing for trial by Grand Assize, and that Philip's Attorney, Warner de Bradele, essoigned himself by Roger Brun. An adjournment to Nov. 12 was the result. That day was given to such Recognizors as were in attendance, viz. to Robert de Essington, Robert de Halgeton, Adam de Brimton, John de Aeton and William de Wilbricton of Staffordshire, and to Nicholas de Wylilegh and Robert de Sta pelton of Shropshire : and the Sheriff was to produce the others (non-attendants) bodily in Court.32 On the day named (Nov. 12,1233), the \"Great Assize between Fulco Fitz Warin, Plaintiff, and Philip de Bur ward esleg concerning land in Asselegh, was respited to one month of Easter (i.e. to May 21, 1234) by reason of the default (non-attendance) of the Re cognizors.\" 33 On that day Warner de Bradele, Philip's Attorney, had essoign _' Salop .4.ssizes, 6 Hen.

We are however most fortunate in having a hint as to its probable termination. In the year 1259, the then Fulk Fitz Warin of Whittington was in receipt of an annual quit-rent of 7s. chargeable on one third of the Manor of Ashley.35 He probably had a similar lien on the other shares of the Manor, and indeed evidence of that fact occurs.36 This brings round the more general and interesting question of descent with which we are concerned. \u2014 It matters not whether the Fulk Fitz Warin of 1259 held this rent-charge as an inheritance derived from a succession of an cestors, or whether after long disuse the hereditary due had been re-established by law. \u2014 It was clearly a seigneural right, and represented a bond fide claim. As such its existence is in perfect conformity with, nay a circumstantial proof of, the theory which has now, I think, been established, viz. that the family of De Burwardsley were Fitz Warins, they and the Fitz Warins of Whittington descended respectively from a younger and elder Son of Warin de Metz. That certain Armorial Bearings were at an early period common to both houses may perhaps be taken as a final and conclusive evidence on the question.37 34 _______ apud Westm. Easter Term 18 Hen.

This half-hide Philip appears to have granted to the Knights Templars of Lidley before the year 1240.\" About this time he seems to have died, leaving no issue. His Brother Roger was his heir. His wife Emma also survived him. The period of his tenure of Broseley and Ashley is well illustrated by a series of deeds, which must be briefly recited. \u2014 Philip de Burwardsley grants to the Abbot and Convent of Buildwas a right of quarry throughout his wood of Burwardsley towards the construction of their buildings. They may make a road from their quarries to the Severn and cut down trees for that purpose, but must leave the timber on the ground. \u2014 Witnesses : Fulco de Alberburi, William de Warren and Ranulf his Brother, Gerald Fitz Toret, Roger de Restune, Memun de Swiney, William de Aseley.42 Besides his attestation of two Brockton Deeds, the earliest of which passed between the years 1216 and 1224, Philip de Bur wardesley deals with part of his tenure in that manor as follows. \u2014 He grants to \" Ralph de Sonforde and his heirs a virgate in the *> Rot.

On 12 March 1227, he attests a Charter of Wenlock Priory.50 He appears as claiming some interest in Higley agaiust Ralph de Mortimer of Wigmore, in August 1228, and again in May 1229. 51 The result of his suits was a Fine dated Nov. 21, 1236, whereby Ralph de Mortimer granted feoffment of a carucate in Huggel' to Roger and his heirs.68 Roger's claim had in the second instance been prosecuted under writ of \" mort d'ancestre,\" whereby I presume that it arose through his mother, who must have been a second wife of Warin de Bur wardsley, otherwise Philip, elder brother of Roger and living in 1229 if not in 1236, could have been the only claimant under such a writ. Be that as it may, Roger de Burwardsley and another are entered on a Roll, of date about 1240, as holding one knight's fee in Hugeleg under Ralph de Mortimer.63 The next notice which I have of Roger de Burwardsley involves the fact of his decease previous to 12 Oct. 1243. On that day the King's Writ, directing the usual Inquisition on the death of a Tenant in capite, issued.64 The Return reports that the Deceased \" held two carucates in Demesne in Esseleg, and seven virgates in villanage by service of finding one horseman at Montgomery 65 for fifteen days : \u2014 that 52 Fines at Salop, 21 nen.

The Sheriff of Staffordshire was enjoined to take their security for payment of 100*. relief to the Crown, and to give them livery of the land in question, saving to Mabel, the eldest sister, her esnecy 66 of the aforesaid land.57 They had accounted for the said 100s. before Michaelmas 1245.58 We must now 'say something of each of these coheiresses. \u2014 Mabel de Burwardsley, the eldest, has already been mentioned under the name of Mabel le Strange, and as having, previously to Michaelmas 1194, been married to Adam de Beysin. Though she was now (1244) living, fifty years after her marriage, her husband had been some time dead. At his decease in 1238, he left by Mabel, Adam his son and heir, a second son Warin, of whom presently, and a daughter Margery, who about 1225 had married Thomas de Bagsore. Adam de Beysin, son and heir of Adam, did not live long to enjoy his paternal inheritance. He died Dec. 1.3, 1243, leaving an only son and heir, Robert, about sixteen months old at his father's death. During the first part of his very long minority Robert's grandmother, Mabel, was yet alive and so representing the interests of this branch of the family in one-third of Broseley. We will first say what remains to be said of her. \u2014 In the year 1244 or 1245, calling herself Mabel daughter of Warin de Burwardesleg, she grants in lawful widowhood to Warin her son all the land which by hereditary right had fallen or should fall to her in the vills of Edulvescote (Arlscott) and of West Bradeleye (Bradley near Broseley).

At Michaelmas 1247, Mabel de Burwardeleg appears as having accounted half a merk to the Sheriff for some default.60 An Inquisition, of September 1263, presently to be cited, speaks of Mabel de Beysin having held dower in her former husband's lands ; but the Record is so defaced that I can extract from it no inference as to the period of her death or whether, as was barely possible, she was living at the date of the Inquest.61 Of Warin her younger son, and Margery her daughter, I shall speak elsewhere ; but here of \u2014 Robert de Beysin, grandson and heir of Mabel, who had, as I have said, a very long minority and (his father having been a tenant in capite) was in the first instance a ward of the Crown. The King granted the said wardship to Sibil Giffard, who sold it to Sir Baldwin Freville. The latter again sold it, either altogether, or in so far as the marriage of the heir was concerned, to Sir Philip le Bret. Hence the following statement by the jurors of Wenlock Liberty in 1255. \u2014 \" Robert de Beyssin is Lord of Burewardesleg, and of Edullescot (Arlscot) and Bradeleg, and he holds of the Prior of Wenlock. He does suit to the Court of the Prior as, before Richard I's time, his ancestors did suit to Munselowe Hundred. Robert was in custody of the King. The King gave said custody to Dame Sibil Giffard, she to Sir Baldwin Frevill, who sold Robert's marriage to Sir Philip de Bret.\" 63 The contemporary Inquisitions as to Robert de Beysin's other Manors give additional information, e.g. under Wrickton we are told that he was already married (he was only thirteen years of age) to Philip le Bret's daughter, though Baldwin Freville is still called his guardian ; under Silvington Philip le Bret is called his guardian, and William de Freville under Billingsley.63 Another Inquest (taken Sept. 22, 1263) informs us that Sibil and the legend \u2014 S' Mabilie de Buee- WAEDESLEG-H. It is mentioned in several Inquisitions but with some variety; for instance, in time of Edward II, the day on which the ser vice was performed was Christmas Day, and the Beysin of that time was to pay a three days' visit to the Prior, and be en tertained, together with his suit, at the Prior's charge. The Lords of Broseley also owed suit to the Prior's Hundred- Court at Burton, every three weeks. 60 Rot. Pip. 31 Hen. Ill, Salop. 61 Inquisitions, 47 Hen. Ill, No. 26. 62 Rot. Hund. ii, 84, 86.

Giffard conveyed the wardship of Robert to Sir William Devereux.64 The latter certainly had it soon after 1255, but perhaps not im mediately from Sibil Giffard. The temporary interest thus acquired by Sir William d'Evereux in Broseley is involved in many matters which affected his ward equally with the other representatives of Roger de Burwardsley. We shall therefore give such details in another place. Here we will recount only those particulars which concern the guardian ship, and which are in themselves somewhat complicated. At Michaelmas 1260, Robert de Beysin had fined 1 merk \"to have an assize.\" 65 He was in fact suing William Devereux and Matilda his wife for the Manor of Billingsley, and, as I have before mentioned, a Patent had issued for trial of the cause on July 20 previous.66 Owing probably to this difference between the ward and his guardian, an Inquisition was ordered to ascertain the age of the former. Its report was to the effect that he would be 19 years of age on August 15, 1261 .67 A second Inquest on the same question sat Sept. 22, 1263, reported Robert as of full age on August 15 previous, and that he was in ward to Sir William Devereux.68 Sir William Devereux fell at the battle of Evesham (August 4, 1265), and though not on the Royalist side, a Patent dated Oct. 12 of the same year, grants his Manors of Hamme, Frome, and Wileby, to his widow Matilda for her life.69 Nor did Matilda's interest in Robert de Beysin's Manors of Broseley and Billingsley cease with his minority, or the death of her husband. \u2014 As Matilda de Ebroicis, she grants in her lawful widowhood to Geoffrey de Bosco of Burwardesleye and Margery his wife a mes suage and half-ferdendel of land in Burwardesleye, to have and to hold for her (Matilda's) life.\u2014 Rent to be 3*. 8d.

Robert de Beysin was certainly deceased before he had long completed his twenty-fifth year. On Sept. 19, 1267, the King granted marriage of his widow Isabella to Hugh de Beaumes (as I shall show more fully under Tong), and in September 1272, the said Isabella (daughter I presume of Philip le Bret) was reported by the Stottesden Jurors as having remarried Robert de Turberville without the King's assent. Their lands were ordered to be seized, and the Sheriff was to cause their appearance in Court.71 The same Jurors also reported a murder in Isabella's household. Richard, a boy in her service, had been killed by a man of Thomas Botterel.73 At this time Walter de Beysin, son and heir, I presume, of Robert, was, as might be expected from what has been related of his Father, in minority. On Nov. 27, 1274, the Stottesden Jurors reported Hugh de Beumeys as having custody of the Manors of Workiton and Walkeslowe by the King's gift.73 In 1284 however (as has already been shown under Billingsley) Walter de Beysin was of age and subject to a prosecution by Matilda Devereux.74 He was at the same time in full possession of his Manors of Wrickton and Walkerslowe.75 At this point we may leave the subject of his succession, and revert to the history of the other two coheiresses of Roger de Burwardsley. \u2014 Alice, the second of the three sisters, to whom livery of their inheritance had been given in February 1244, was, like her elder sister, a widow at the time.

Between the years 1244 and 1249, this Alice, calling herself daughter of Warin de Burwardsley and a widow, grants to Amicia her daughter all her land of inheritance in Adulvescote, with one third of the tenement which Dame Emma, formerly wife of her Brother Philip, still held in dower in Burwardsley.

The cause was adjourned to the morrow of Ascension Day.84 We shall presently see that in all this litigation each of the three Coparcners in Broseley were represented. At the Assizes of October 1272, the Jurors of Wenlock Liberty reported how Roger de Eyton and Petronilla his daughter had previously accused, in the County Court, Robert de Benethall, Hugh his brother, and John de Kantreyn, of rape and robbery, and 80 81 Placita apud Westm.

The case, it appears, had been carried from the County-Court to the hearing of the King, but had not yet been settled.85 In the mean time the parties had accorded among themselves. As however the King's peace was involved in the question, the Jurors were now obliged to prosecute it. They acquitted the defendants of robbery, but found them all guilty of a forcible attack on Roger de Eyton's house in Broseley and the abduction of his daughter. Hugh de Benthall, guilty of the further crime charged above, was ordered to be instantly arrested (or retained in custody).86 At the same Assizes, the Stottesden Jurors reported that Roger Fitz Denys of Burwardsle, having accused Philip le Mouner of Benthal of robbery, and being in pursuit of him, the latter turned to defend himself on the bridge of Brug and was killed in the con flict which ensued. Roger was arrested for murder, but by the King's precept had been given into custody of certain sureties, viz. Ralph de Caueleg (Caughley), Anian de Burwardel, John de Bur wardel, Nicholas de la Dene, Adam Fitz Denys, &c. Since then, Sibil, widow of Philip, had challenged Roger in the County-Court, so that he was yet in prison. The Jurors now found that he slew Philip le Mouner in self-defence.87 Before I quit the matter of Alice de Eyton's interest here, it may be proper to say that the head branch of her descendants (under whom it is probable that the above Roger de Eyton held) never resided at Broseley, but in Staffordshire. Some former mis-statements as to her succession should be briefly rectified. Alice was succeeded at Ashley in 1252 by her eldest son John de Eyton, and he by another John who died in 1290. Again a John de Eyton followed, who, having been born in 1266, died in 85 We have some record of what had taken place before the King in this prose cution. On June 9, 1269, Petronilla de Eyton appeared to prosecute the four de fendants for rape and breaking the King's peace. The Sheriff was ordered to arrest them and keep them in custody till Oct. 6, and then to have their bodies before the King (Plac. coram Rege, Trin. Term 53 Hen. Ill, memb. 14 dorso). ordered to require them to appear before himself and the Keepers of the Pleas of the Crown and proceed to outlaw them. He now reports that Robert de Benthall and John de Kantreyn were not found. So he was again ordered to outlaw them and have their bodies in court on Nov. 18. He was at the same time to produce Hugh de Benthall whom he had in custody (Plac. coram Rege, Mich. Term 53 and 54 Hen. Ill, memb. 2 recto). 86 Placita Coron\u0153, 56 Hen.

This Thomas is said to have sold his share of Ashley to Sir Thomas Beysin.88 Something of the same kind must have happened in regard to the Eytons' share of Broseley, but when the alienation took place or who was the Vendor, I cannot determine. It remains to speak of Margery, who in 1244 had livery of one third of Ashley as the youngest of the three Sisters and Coheirs of Roger de Burwardsley. She had been some time wife of John Bagot of Blymhill (Staffordshire), but had long been a Widow. As early as November 1229, I find her in litigation with Roger la Zuche of Tong, under the name of Margery Baggot.89 Their suit concerned Blymhill, where Margery will have been then seized of dower, if not more extensively interested on behalf of her children, and where I believe La Zuche had some claim of a seigneural kind hereafter to be noticed. In a Record which must be of date about 1240, the Heirs of John Bagot are said to hold two fees in Blimenhul and Brinton under the Barons Stafford.90 These heirs of John Bagot were, I think, four daughters, but I can give particulars of no more than three, viz. Philippa wife of Geoffrey de Bromley, * * * wife of William de Ipstones, and Margery wife first of Ralph de Covene, and secondly of William de Drayton. The fourth daughter, I imagine, married a Pichford, branches of which family came to be interested both in Blymhill and Broseley, and if in one instance by purchase, yet in the other, I think, by inheritance. But I must first speak of Margery de Burwardsley the Mother of these Coheiresses. She must be presumed to have succeeded to her share of Broseley coincidently with the period of her Brother's death, and her livery of one-third of Ashley ; i. e. in 1243 or 1244. Soon after this, and calling herself Margery Fitz Warin, she granted to Ralph de Covene, and Margery her daughter, and the heirs of their bodies, her interest, or most of it, in Broseley. To secure this grant a fine was levied at Salop on Nov. 8, 1248, in form following \u2014 my prolixity in verifying statements which constitute a general contradiction of all that he wrote on the subject. 89 Rot.

Margery de Blomenhull acknowledges the right of the Plaintiffs, as of the gift of herself ;\u2014 to have and to hold, to Ralph and Margery (his wife), and the heirs of the latter. For this the Plaintiffs gave one sore sparrow-hawk.\"91 Margery de Blymhill's abandonment of her interest here to her daughter, wife of Ralph de Covene, long before her own death will also appear in another way. About January 1250, Geoffrey de Langley and his Fellow Justices were commissioned to visit several Counties for the purpose of fixing an annual rent on all those portions of the King's Forests which had been reduced into culti vation by private individuals. Whatever the period of their visit to Shropshire, three years such rent had been paid before Michaelmas 1252, by sundry persons assessed in the Arrentation- Roll of these Justices. Thus Ralph de Cove and Robert Beysin are put in charge for 6c?. annually, in respect of half an acre in Borewardel, and had paid the said arrears.93 In 1255, William de Ypstans, Ralph de Covene, Geoffrey de Bromley, and Richard de Pychford appear as joint Lords of Blym hill,93 which gives an approximate idea as to the coheirship of John Bagot and of his wife Margery. The latter however was still living, and appears to have survived till 1259. The Inquisition on her death, as a tenant in capite bears date 10th May, 43 Hen. Ill (1259), and reports of her as follows \u2014 That \" Margeria de Blumenhull held one third of Ascheleye by payment to the king of half a merk whenever a Scutage was levied.

Were this point not particularized, the terms of the Inquisition and Precept just recited might lead to the erroneous inference that she had only been Mother of two daughters. We now return to Ralph de Covene and his wife Margery, one of the daughters and coheirs thus mentioned. Ralph had his name from Coven (near Shareshill, Staffordshire), a Manor which he held under the Barons Stafford. In the year following that in which he and his wife secured by fine their interest in Broseley, i. e. in the year 1249, he was appointed Justice for gaol- delivery at Brug.96 In the year 1255, he appears not only as Lord of Covene and a Coparcner in Blymhill, but as Seneschall of the King's Forests in Staffordshire.97 In August 1256, he occurs as holding the same office in the Royal Forest of Feckenham (Worcestershire) .98 His concern in Broseley, in 1259, has already been set forth, and this is the latest notice which I have of him, except that between that year and 1262 he concurred with his wife Margery in demising their joint interests in Broseley to Geoffrey de Picheford Sister's son was twenty-six, she herself cannot have been much less than fifty.

He left Margery his widow surviving, who soon after remarried to William de Drayton. He also left two or more daughters, of whom Alice the eldest was wife of Robert de Pende ford at the time of her Father's death. From this Robert and Alice, Geoffrey de Picheford obtained a grant in fee of the whole of what had been Ralph de Covene's interest in Broseley, but whereas Margery Ralph's widow was surviving, this feoffment and the 40*. annual rent which it reserved to the Feoffors were obviously more than they could grant or receive, with any show of justice.100 Shortly after this transaction Robert de Pendeford died, when his widow Alice renewed the bargain with Geoffrey de Picheford in form following, \u2014 \" Know all men that I, Alice eldest daughter of Sir Ralph de Covene, in my liege widowhood, of my certain knowledge, and by the advice of my friends, and not under constraint, have given, &c. to Geoffrey de Picheford and his heirs all my land of Borewardeslee which my Lord Robert de Pendeford and I formerly made over to him, with the third part of the Advowson of the Church, and the third of the Dower of the Lady (Emma widow of Philip de Burwardsley) when she shall chance to die. \u2014 Rendering to me and my heirs 40s. annually under the same distraint as is more fully contained in the Charter which passed between my Lord Robert de Pendeford and me and the same Geoffrey on the subject. \u2014 Witnesses: Hugh de Bolingale, William de Perton, Philip de Beckebur, John de Grenehul, William de Umfreston, Ralph de Kachylee, Philip de Swyneye, John de Bispeston Clerk, &c.\"101 The next event in this somewhat complex story was the re marriage of Alice, widow of Robert de Pendeford, to Thomas Sany: and now the question seems first to have arisen whether Alice 99 At the Forest Assizes of Feb. 1262, Ralph de Cove appears subject to an amercement of 12 merksfor having hounds within limits of the Forest without war rant (Forest Pleas, No. 4, memb. 5 recto) : and the debt was still unpaid at Michaelmas 1267 (Rot.

Accordingly William de Drayton and the said Margery sued Geoffrey de Pichford, the tenant, under a writ of dower in the County Court. Geoffrey called to warranty his Feoffor Alice and her then husband Thomas Sany.- \u2014 \u25a0 They, not venturing to vouch such warranty (timentes war rantiam), treated at once with William de Drayton and Margery, and came to an agreement whereby the latter were to withdraw their writ against Geoffrey de Pichford and receive 20*. out of the said 40*. rent during the life of Margery, Geoffrey de Pichford being authorized so to pay the same. \u2014 But this concord did not endure ; for in Hilary Term 1272, at Westminster, Thomas Sany (\"Sayne\") and Alice his wife are found suing Geoffrey de Pichford and Mary his wife for performance of customs, rents, and services due in Burwardele.103 The cause was adjourned to the morrow of Ascension, but did not come on for actual trial till the County Assizes in September, and then in a different form: for \"Thomas and Alice sued WiUiam de Drayton and Margery for 20*. rent in Burwardsle, which Alice used to receive from Geoffrey de Picheford, with other 20*., from one-third of a carrucate of land there.\" 103 William and Margery replied that \" they had the said 20*. as of the dower of Margery and by gift of Ralph de Covene her former husband, one of whose heirs Alice was.\" The Plaintiffs here availed themselves of this misapplication of the term dower, saying that \" Ralph de Covene never was tenant (sole), because the tenement was once Margery Fitz Warin's, who in her widowhood gave it to Ralph de Covene, his wife Margery (Margery Fitz Warin's daughter) and their heirs, of their bodies, by a Charter,\" which they (the Plaintiffs) now produced, \" whereby,\" said the Plaintiffs, \" Margery William's wife was joint tenant with her former husband Ralph (habuit quantum Radulphus), and Ralph could not give her dower of such tenement.\" \u2014 The Defendants acknowledged all this, and in reply recited the previous proceedings, viz. the term granted by Ralph de Covene and Margery his wife to Geoffrey de Pichford, the death of said Ralph, the feoffment granted by Robert de Pendeford and Alice, 102 Placita apud Westm.

Soon after this Geoffrey de Pichford compounded his obligation to pay 40*. rent to Thomas Sany and his wife Alice ; indeed we may say that he bought up their whole interest in the Manor of Broseley. A fine was levied at Westminster in Michaelmas Term 1274 between Geoffrey de Pychford Plaintiff (querentem), and Thomas Pani (so written) and Alice his wife, Impedients, of 40*. rent, one-third of a carrucate of land, and one-third the Advowson of the Church of Burwardesley, whereby Thomas and Alice surrendered the whole, as the right of Geoffrey, by their own gift : \u2014 to hold to Geoffrey and his heirs, of Thomas and Alice, and the heirs of Alice for ever : \u2014 rendering therefore to the Vendors one clovel0i yearly, and performing in their stead all services due to the Lords of the Fee. For this Geoffrey paid 30 merks.105 This fine was followed by another, levied at Westminster on July 1, 1275, whereby Henry de Parco and Margery his wife, Impedients, surrendered to Geoffrey de Pycheford and Mary his wife, Plaintiffs (querentes), a ninth share of the Manor and Advow son of Burwardesle, whereof was a plea of warranty : \u2014 to hold to Geoffrey and Mary, and the heirs of Geoffrey, of Henry and Margery, and the heirs of Margery, for ever : \u2014 rendering a rose yearly and performing all capital services.

But we should say something of Geoffrey, as of a much more im portant personage than his purchases in Broseley would indicate. \u2014 When in November 1271, the Justices of the King's Forests visited the County, he appears as \" Seneschal of all the Forests of Salop,\" an office superior to that of John Fitz Hugh of Bowlas, who follows him on the Record as Capital Forester. ,107 But he was more than this. In 1280, he is charged with the sale of all old oak-trees within and without the King's Park of Windsor. In 1281, he was appointed Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex ; in 1283, he appears as Constable of Windsor Castle ; and in 1299, being dead, the Executors of his will are ordered to give up to another the Castle and Forest of Windsor with all stores, &c. for the King's behoof.108 He was succeeded at Broseley by his son Richard, of whom all that I shall say is, that on Nov. 3, 1312, he conveyed to Richard de Ha'Iee and Burgia his wife all his land in Borewardeslee, with the capital messuage, Advowson of the Church, homages, services, suits of free men and natives, and two mills near the Dene, to hold to them and their heirs, rendering to the chief Lords all due services. \u2014 Witnesses : Walter de Huggeford, William le Forcer, Hugh le Fitz Ayer, Knights, Thomas de Beysin, Geoffrey de Kinsedeleye, John de Aldenham, Richard de Knyghteleye, and others.

The dates of all Shropshire deeds in which he is con cerned will probably be ascertained by stating his general and higher connections with the County. He was Deputy to Peter de Rivallis who entered upon office as Sheriff on July 11, 123.2. The latter being removed early in 1234, Robert de Haya was on March 25, appointed sole Custos or Sheriff, and so continued till Nov. 4, 1236.111 In Nov. 1240, he visited Shrewsbury as a Justice Itinerant, in company with Robert de Lexinton, Ralph de Sulleg (the first witness of the above deed), and others. Ten years afterwards he was Fermor under the Crown of Arley (on the borders of Shropshire) ; and nothing further can I say of him. The above deed I imagine to have passed in 1240, a date which becomes still more probable from the fact that Ralph Baron Sudley, of Gloucestershire, the first Witness, was lately deceased on March 19, 1242. I think it probable that Robert de Haya's interest in Broseley passed to William de Haya, who, being also Rector of the Church, enfeoffed a relation, John Fitz Silvester of Souldern (Oxon.), in his lay possessions here. This John Fitz Silvester of Sulthorn (Souldern) grants by deed to Thomas his Son all the said land, with reliefs escheats, &c. to hold of the Lords of the fee by usual services. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir Ranulf de Ardene Knight, Adam de Bray, William de Overthon- 110 Charter at Willey.

I have said something already of the vast parochial Jurisdiction which was in ancient times divided among the few Saxon Churches of this County. The Church of Saint Milburg at Wenlock claimed and exercised the spiritual cure of a district which was bounded along its whole Southern frontier by the almost equal parish of Saint Gregory of Morville. The Manor of Broseley stood within the bounds of Saint Mil burg's Parish ; and the Church or Chapel which was founded at Broseley in the twelfth or fourteenth century was so founded as subject to the Mother Church of Wenlock. Doubtless the work was that of a Layman, and probably of the contemporary Lord of the Fee. In token of its affiliation on the Church of Saint Milburg, and probably as a condition of its origin, the Incumbent of the Church or Chapel of Burwardsley was taxed with an annual pension of 2s., payable at the feast of St. Nicholas to the Mother Church. lw 112 Charter at Willey. This Deed cer tainly passed between the years 1243 and 1272. The first six witnesses all belong to Souldern (Oxon.), a Manor which Sir Ralph de Erderne (or Ardern) held in 1255 of the Barony of Richard's Castle. Fritwell is an adjoining Manor. (Rot.

This pension seems to have been allotted to the Sacristan of the Mother Church, which may account for its not appearing in more general Rolls of the receipts of the Priory.

In the absence of any Chartulary of Wenlock Priory we must infer the date of foundation from other evidence. In 1291, the Church or Chapel of Burewardsleye in the Deanery of Wenlock was valued at \u00a36. 13*. id. per annum, and the Rector was elsewhere beneficed.115 In 1341, this Taxation of 10 merks was made a basis of the current assessment of this Parish to the ninth; but the Assessors allowed a considerable abatement, and exacted only 42*. The reasons were because the growing corn had been destroyed by great tempests, because a large proportion of the Parish lay uncultivated, owing to the poverty of the Tenants, and because the glebe and small tithes of the Chapel contributed to swell the greater sum (10 merks) and were not rateable on the present occasion.110 In 1535, Edmund Michell was Rector of Broseley and Lynley ; the value of his preferment in glebe and tithes averaged \u00a38. 5s. 8d. per annum, and the only charges thereon were for Archdeacon's Synodals and Procurations, 7*. 2<_.117 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Another William is, I find, mentioned as having been Rector of Broseley in 1241. n8 If this be correct he will perhaps be the same with that William de Haya, Parson of Burwardsley, who granted lay possessions here, before 1272, to John Silvester of Souldern. us pupe Nich.

We have already seen this Church vacant in October 1258, and January 1259. Another vacancy in 1271 is probably indicated by the proceedings then instituted relative to the right of pre sentation. Oct. 29, 1279, the Bishop of Hereford collated John de Brug Subdeacon to this Church, exercising a right which had devolved to him under authority of a general Council, but declaring the right of patronage to be vested thereafter in Sir Geoffrey de Pychford.119 Robert Turbur ville was Rector of this Chapel from about 1290 to 1300. He held therewith the Parish Church of Whethulle (Wheat hill), which involved a cure of souls. This tenure in plurality would not have been legal without a Papal dispensation, had Broseley been a Cure also. As this Incumbent had no such dispensation, that fact was afterwards alleged in proof of Broseley being without Cure of Souls.120 Richard de Pycheford was the next Incumbent of Broseley. He held the Chapel \" a long time\" (apparently ten years), and with it the Curative Church of Covelham in Winchester Diocese. Aug 15, 1310, the Bishop instituted to this Chapel Geoffrey de Pychford on the presentation of Richard de Pychford. Geoffrey was Brother of the last Incumbent. In 1314 he had Episcopal license to study for three years. He held together with Broseley, a Curative Church \"in Salisbury Diocese, near to Windsor Forest, and the Town of Bray.\" At his death and previous to 1332, \u2014 Sir John Aaron had succeeded to the preferment. He then held together with this Chapel the Church of Madeley, which involved a cure of souls. Aaron was subjected to some proceedings by his Diocesan as a Pluralist.- \u2014 On Saturday, January 18, 1332, the Bishop's Commissary, Stephen de Salop, Rector of Oldbury, heard the case in the Parish Church of Wenlock. The first Witness \u2014 Walter de Caleweton, Literate, a man of more than sixty-eight years of age \u2014 proved from his own recollections for forty-two years the principal facts above recited.131 The issue of the suit does not directly appear, but as Aaron resigned the \" Free Chapel of Bourgwardesleye,\" not till 25 Sept. 1359, his tenure as a Pluralist would seem to have and 1292 (Supra, Vol. I, p. 75). 121 Evidence for Sir John Aaron, &e (MS. at Willey). 119 Ibidem, quoting Hereford Register. 120 Robert de Tui-burvilk- has already occurred as a Prebendary of Brug in 1291"], [530, "36 BROSELEY. been recognized, and the non-curative nature of this Chapelry may be inferred. On October 7, 1359, the admission of, \u2014 Roger de Knightleye to this Free Chapel bears date at Bishops Castle. The King was Patron by reason of the Priory of Wenlock being in his hands in consequence of the war with France. John de Burton, Custos of this Chapel, resigned it on June 6, 1381, for the Prebend of Taunton in the Cathedral of Wells, here tofore held by \u2014 James de Byllingford, who was instituted to Broseley April 23, 1383, on a presentation of the Crown similar to the last. Billyng ford, called \"Rector, Custos, or Master of this Free Chapel,\" resigned in 1385 ; and on May 11 \u2014 Robert Calle, Clerk, of the Diocese of York, was instituted on the King's nomination.123 \u2014 These successive presentations by the Crown do not, I think, indicate that the Advowson was at any time the sole right of Wenlock Priory. In two out of the three cases the King was per haps exercising a mediate right, like that which shall be noticed under Badger. ARLSCOT AND BRADLEY. A glance at the Map will show the situation of these vills, the latter of which was occasionally called West Bradley to distinguish it from another Bradley in the same Liberty of Wenlock. That either of these places was involved in the Domesday Manor of Bosle is more than I will undertake to say. Possibly they were Members of the greater Manor of Wenlock, but as then- subsequent tenure under the Priory, by the Lords of Broseley, associates them with the latter Manor, I will give some account of them here, though it may be inaccurate thus to class them under the Domesday Hundred of Alnodestreu. We have already seen Mabel de Burwardsley, about the year 1244, enfeoffing her younger son Warin de Beysin in all her interest in Edulvescote and West-Bradeleye at the nominal rent of a pound of pepper.123 \u2014 Warin, thus and otherwise advanced, would seem to have been founder of a second family of Bey sins.

The Hundred Roll of 1255, which describes the tenures of Manors in the Staffordshire Hundred of Cuddleston, writes him as holding \" 2 carrucates in Stuston of the Barony of Wenlock.\" 126 At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, I find Warin de Beyssin in company with Ralph de Caughley, Philip de SwTiney and William le Masun, as a Regarder of the Forests of Mors and Shirlet, and amerced for a careless return.127 And this is a suitable occasion to introduce a deed whereby he grants to Margaret his daughter for her homage, &c. half his land in Edulvescote, to hold of him and his heirs. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir Geoffrey de Uv.ton (Overton), Sir Ralph d' Arraz, Hugh de Lega, Ralph de Cakel' (Caughley), Philip de Swyney, William de Hemton, &c.128 I can say nothing more of Warin de Beysin ; but at the Assizes of October 1272, Robert de Edlescote had been entered as a Juror of Wenlock Liberty, and his name, for some cause, erased.129 At the Inquest of Nov. 27, 1274, he however was a member of a similar panel.130 I think it possible that this Robert de Arlscot was the same person who as Robert de Beysin, and somewhat later in the cen tury, granted to Sir Walter de Beysin and his heirs an annual rent of half a pound of pepper, receivable from certain tenements which Richard Miller and Roger Bobur used to hold of the Grantor in West Bradeleye. \u2014 Witnesses : William le Masoun of Moghale, Hugh dc Patinton, John de Brocton, John de Presthop, Roger de Weston, Roger de Corfhul, Henry le Hethene de Laverden (Larden), and others.131 124 Rot.

Another Philip succeeded, who at the last date was a Regarder of Mors and Shirlot Forests, and amerced for a faulty return. In Hilary Term 1267, this Philip, in company with Hugh de Bolinghale, Hamo le Botiller, and Roger de Eyton, was being sued at Westminster by Katherine de Lacy for a debt of 4 merks and also for 2 years arrears of an annual rent of 10 merks, alleged to be due from them to her.133 At the Assizes of September 1272, he was amerced with eleven other Jurors for some concealment, but with Warner de Swyneye attended on the Jury for Wenlock Liberty.

It may in 1086 have been an outlying member of Wenlock Manor, or it may have been a then unreclaimed portion of the Norman Earl's Demesne, which we know included Shirlot Forest and other places about which Domesday is equally silent. At all subsequent periods I can speak of Linley only as a Manor held in Socage1 under the Priory of Wenlock, but whether that seigneury existed at Domesday, or whether it was acquired early or late in the following Century, no Record is forthcoming to in form us. Richard de Linley, whoever held over him, was doubtless pos sessed of this Manor before the death of Henry I.

In 1177, we have a Walter de Linley doubtless related to this Richard, and who has been already noticed as a Grantee of Crown Lands in Brug, afterwards enjoyed by Sibil de Linley.5 At the Forest Assize of 1180, Richard de Linley stands next to his neighbour Warner de Wililey as assessed in the sum of 2*. by the Justices. About the same time and in company with the same Warner and Warin de Burwardsley, he attests that invaluable Charter of Corve which I am so often referring to. The close of the Century introduces another Lord of Linley, apparently the last in male succession. This was Philip de Linley, who besides attesting nearly contemporary charters of Isabel de Say to Wenlock and of Griffin de Sutton to Wombridge, appears in the oft-cited Composition of 1196 (concerning Priors Ditton Church), and in May 1200, was Recognizor in a law-suit which William Fitz Alan II had against Gilbert de Lacy about land at Harnage.6 The eventual Successors, perhaps the daughters, of this Philip were two Coheiresses, one of whom seems to have become the wife of William le Forcer, the other (Isolda) of Wido de Fernlawe (Fallow) . I shall have other opportunities of following the descent of these Coparcners in Linley. Here I will state only that which relates more immediately to the said Manor. In 1255, Henry le Forcer, son and heir of the above-named William, served on the Inquest as to Tenures in Wenlock Liberty. The Manor of Linley is thus noticed, and as if exclusively his. \u2014 \" Henry le Forcer is Lord of the vill and holds under the Prior of Wenloc and does due suit to the Prior's Court ; and his Ancestors 2 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 19, 24, 32. 3 Monasticon, iii, 519, No. 2.

The King's Writ ordering such Inquest bears date 25th Oct. 1272. As regards Linley, the Jurors returned little more than that the deceased held half the vill under the Prior.8 A second Inquest which sat at Newport on July 6th, 1273, in obedience to a writ of certiorari, is more explicit. It states that Henry le Forcer had held a messuage and carrucate of land at Linley under the Prior by Socage, doing homage to the Prior and owing suit of Court every three weeks : that the whole Manor was worth \u00a33. 13*. 6d. per annum, less a rent-charge of 9*. due annually to the heirs of Philip de Farlowe : and that the Liberty of St Milburg was such as that the Prior had no right of wardship or marriage over the heirs of those his men who held by homage.\"9 Henry le Forcer left a widow, Burga, and a son, William, who (having been born Sept. 29, 1256) was under age at his Father's death, and was claimed as a ward of the Crown. That claim how ever was unfounded, for a reason which will be given under Brockton. This William would seem to have been chiefly resident in Shropshire, though he inherited from his Father the Manor of Elstow (Leicestershire),10 \u2014 a more extensive property than Linley. Being also a Tenant of Salop Abbey (as I have shown under Nordley), William le Forcer attests two deeds of that House dated respectively May 25, 1298, and March 29, 1303.11 About 1310, and being then a Knight, he attests two deeds which will be given under Tong and Donington.

LINLEY CHAPEL. This foundation would appear to have belonged to a class not very numerous in early times. It was I suppose a private Chapel attached to the residence of the Lords of Linley. Situated within the Parish of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock, it was without parochial cure, nor can I find that it had any permanent endowment,16 or that its Incumbents were presented to the Bishops of Hereford for Institution. Neither does it appear to have been liable to any such charge or pension as was usually reserved by the Mother Church of any district, as a condition of these minor foundations. In the absence of all early notice of a Chapel existing here, we find some architectural remains which attest a high degree of antiquity. Its Founder was doubtless one of those Lords of Linley who have been already spoken of as holding the yet un severed Manor down to the close of the twelfth century. The Wenlock Jurors at the Assizes of October 1203, reported of a Robber who after commission of his crime took sanctuary in the Church of Linley.17 From that period till the year 1535, when the Chapel appears as united to Broseley,18 no mention of its exist- ence has occurred to my notice. 13 Parliamentary Writs, vol. iv, p. 397, where the printed copy gives, with its usual inaccuracy, William Luffbrd as Lord.

This place demands a separate notice on much the same grounds as Linley, viz. as a distinct Tenure under the Priory of Wenlock, yet without any Domesday type, and without any symptom of its having been involved in Wenlock or any other Domesday Manor. The somewhat disjointed notices which seem to relate to it are as follows. \u2014 At the Assizes of November 1221, it was found that Ralph de Sandford (who had lands in Brockton) had unjustly disseized Walter Faber and Agnes his wife of their free tenement in Cacheleg.1 On the death of Richard de Sanford (son of this Ralph) about 1249, it appeared that the deceased had been in receipt of a rent of 8*. payable by Ralph de Kacheleg on land in Kacheleg.2 At the Inquisition of 1255, Ralph de Kacheleg was on the Jury for Wenlock Liberty. He was returned as holding a carucate of land in the vill of Kakeleg for which he paid a rent of 40*. per annum to the Prior of Wenlock and did suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament; and his Ancestors had done suit to the Hundred of Munslow till the time of Richard I.3 On the 16th of September 1289, a writ of King Edward I enjoins the Sheriff of Salop to summon a Jury, which should ascertain the circumstances under which the Manor of Cackeleg was held, and whether it would be to the King's damage if he allowed Nicholas Brisebon of Montgomery to grant the said Manor to the Prior of Wenlock, to have and to hold for ever ? The Jury met at Wenlock on Oct. 23 following, and reported that the pro posed conveyance would not injure the Crown; \u2014 that the Manor was held of the Priory already, by service of 9*. per annum. That its full value (to the Tenant) was 13*. id. per annum, and its contents were a carucate of land.4 Royal Patent allowing the proposed sur render to Wenlock bears date June 20, 1290 (Pat. 18 Edw.

Without attempting to account for this apparent change of value since 1255, I will here only say that this Nicholas Brisebon had two sons, Roger and Hugh, each holding lauds in Brockton (near Sutton), and that Roger Brisebon both before and after the date of this Inquest (1289) was engaged in many transactions with Wombridge Priory, to which house he seems finally to have conveyed most of his said property in Brockton.5 In 1291, among the Temporalities of the Priory of Wenlock was a carucate of land at Caughley, apparently held in demesne, and the annual value of which is laid at 12*. This was doubtless the carucate recently redeemed from Nicholas Brisebon ; but besides this, the Prior was in receipt of 20*. rent in Caughley, evidently chargeable on other land.6 On the 12th of May 1296, another Inquest of the kind called \" ad quod damnum \" was ordered in relation to this Manor. The Jury in this case was to report as to a grant which Philip de Caughleye and Margery de Prestehope proposed to make to Wenlock Priory of a messuage, four virgates of land, and ten acres of wood in Caughleye. The Jurors again gave a verdict in favour of the grant ; and added that the land was afready in the Prior's Liberty and held of him by service of 40*. rent and two suits per annum at the Prior's Court at Burton, \u2014 that the annual value of the premises was 10*. more than the services, \u2014 that Philip had never been liable to serve on Juries in regard to his tenure at Caughleye, but that he held a messuage and half-virgate at Shineton which would oblige him so to serve.7 A valuation of the possessions of Wenlock Priory, taken Sept. 6, 1379, explains part of the apparent inconsistencies of the above extracts. The Monks had then two carrucates at Caugheleye, the result I presume of the two transactions of 1289 and 1296 but the whole was valued only at 6*. 8d. per annum* As regards the family which took its name from this place and of which the above-mentioned Philip was probably the last a few notices should be added.

Besides his occurrence in 1249 and 1255, this Ralph de Kauchelea appears, in September 1258, as negotiating a twelve years' lease of lands in Astley Abbots under Sibil daughter of Henry Fitz Tyrric.9 In February 1262, he appears as Ralph de Cauweleg and as a Regarder of the King's Forest. For some neglect in that office he was amerced.10 The last that I find of him is his complaint in Nov. 1274, against William de Caverswell, who while Sheriff (1268-9) had received a fine of 2*. 7d. from this Ralph, for not producing one for whom he was Surety. The said Sheriff had given the complainant no acquittance, so that he had been again charged with the debt.11 Philip de Caughley, apparently successor of Ralph, has already been spoken of. satiup.

Among them were Longford, Chetwynd, Draitune (Little-Drayton in Hales), Pichford, and Wigwig. He also held Etone (Little Eton, near Pichford, a vill now destroyed) of the Collegiate Church of St. Chad, Shrewsbury.2 This Turold has been represented as a Saxon, and I suppose on very insufficient grounds.3 The name does not belong to the Saxon language, and if not originally Norman or Angevin, it 2 Domesday, so. 253, a 1. 3 There is perhaps no subject on which then and afterwards, belonged as such not to Turold, but to Robert Fitz Tetbald. Mr. Blakeway, the greatest of Shropshire Antiquaries, has left less valuable com ments than this of Turold, his origin, his descent, and his connection with Toret. I cannot pretend to a single item of docu mentary information which did not reach Mr. Blakeway, and can only attribute our differences to his having lent only a cursory attention to the matter. Parts of the subject may more properly belong to a future section of this Work ; but it can hardly be divided, and the earliest is perhaps also the best opportunity to deal with a question which has been mis apprehended by any great authority. But even adopting for a moment Mr. Blakeway's ideas that the Draitune, which Turold granted to Salop Abbey in time of Henry I, was Drayton near Shiffnal, and that Robert Fitz Tetbald was identical with Robert Fitz Turold, we at once find ourselves beset with anomalies, viz. the Son possessed of the Capital Manor (Ites hale), while the Father had only the mem ber (Draitune) ; the Father granting in a generation after his son's advancement; to say nothing of the Abbey being supposed to receive lands in a quarter where they retained no such property, rather than in a quarter where they were afterwards largely interested. Mr. Blakeway tells us substantively (History of Shrewsbury, ii, p. 25) that Turold and Toret, who appear in the Shropshire Domesday, and Tetbald, whose Son Robert occurs as a Feoffee in that Record, were one person. Domesday gives no hint whatever of such identity, and writes the three names with every appa rent observance of their orthographical distinction. If Turold and Tetbald were identical, then we have a Father and Son contemporary and considerable Tenants of the Norman Earl, \u2014 a circumstance of great inherent improbability. Mr. Blakeway further says, that Turold was a Saxon, that he held tliirteen Manors in Domesday, \"in which he is sometimes called Turold, and at others Toret.\" However in the thirteen Manors alluded to, and even in a fourteenth, Turold is uniformly so written ; but if Toret were the same person, then there is mention of Toret in four other Domesday Manors, so that their aggregate tenure was eighteen rather than thirteen Manors. A note by the same Authority also says, that Toret \"though favoured by the Nor mans, was removed from all the estates which he held in time of the Confessor.\" This again is untrue as regards at least half of Toret' s Saxon Manors. Mr. Blakeway also says that the Drai tune held by Turold in Domesday was \"Little Drayton, now called Deckar-hill, in the Parish of Shifnal.\" The fact how ever is, that Turold's Manor of Drayton was in Odenet Hundred, which did not approach Iteshale (the Domesday Shiff nal) in any direction, whilst the Little Drayton, which was a member of Iteshale, It is a wonder that Toreth's attestation of Robert Fitz Turold's Charter to Salop Abbey, did not dissipate this mistake as to his identity with Turold ; but the error is substantively repeated in the \" Sheriffs"], [545, "47 WILLEY. occurs in Normandy before the Conquest, and was borne by several who profited by the Norman invasion of England. With regard to the thirteen Manors held by Turold of the Nor man Earl, an usual but not quite uniform rule of succession is observable. The general rule is that whatever Turold thus held in 1086, was afterwards held by Turold's heirs or successors, not immediately of the Crown, as might have been expected, but as an appendage of the Barony of Fitz Alan. The exceptions to this rule are Longford, Little Drayton, and Wigwig. The first of these (Longford) continued indeed a tenure ... capite, that is, was never subjected to the seigneury of Fitz Alan; but its Tenants were no longer Turold or his heirs, for Henry I bestowed it in another line of succession. This loss of his principal Manor, as well as the degradation of his Fief in the scale of feudal tenures, are circumstances, which I doubt not were associated with some sym pathy or partizanship exhibited by Turold in the cause of Earl Robert de Belesme. Turold evidently survived the fall of his Suzerain, and apparently escaped any more summary forfeiture than that already indicated. It was during the period when King Henry I was holding this County in demesne,4 that under the name of Torald de Verleio (another evidence of his Norman extraction)5 this. Turold granted to Shrewsbury Abbey a hide in Lesser Draiton, or in fact all that Domesday says he possessed there.6 The mode in which King Henry I confirmed this grant, in 1121, would make it probable that it passed during the Viceroyalty of Richard Bishop of London.\" The limits of date thus ascertained, viz. 1108-1121, apply apparently to the further event of Turold's death aud the succession of his son and heir Robert. Certainly before the latter year this Robert had followed his Father's example by granting to Shrews bury Abbey the vill of Wigwig (villam nomine Wichewicarn) . of Shropshire \" (p. 43), where again the mention of Toret's Saxon Manor of Rodington, which he retained in 1086, might have suggested a revision of the whole question. * 4 Monasticon, iii, p. 519, Num. 2, \" His toria Fundationis.\" writers, e.g. Ivry, Pacy, Cressy, &c, are usually written Ibreium, Paeeium, and Cresseium.

There were witnesses of this, besides the said Bishop, Hamo .Peverel, John son of Grip, and Toreth.8 Of Turold and his son Robert, I learn nothing further or with certainty.9\u2014 In eleven of the fourteen Manors which Turold held in 1086, I shall hereafter show that a family, which took name from Chetwynd the chief of those residuary Manors, inherited or obtained Turold's interest. This uniformity of succession in so many Manors indicates I doubt not an inheritance by blood ; but I can establish no particular of generic descent from Robert son of Turold de Verley, who lived in the beginning of the twelfth Century, to Adam de Chetwynd who occurs towards its close. The general rule of territorial succession, now alleged, remains however to be established by particulars. Of the eleven Manors in which we are to show De Chetwynd as the successor of Turold, there is no case in which all evidence on the point might more easily have been lost than that of Willey. It was one of the Manors which were absorbed into the Liberty of Wenlock in time of Richard I ; and thus all trace of its original Tenure might well have vanished ; in fact the usual statement about Willey and other Manors so transferred was that they were thenceforward held of the Prior of Wenlock. Nevertheless it can be shown by a single and fortuitous notice, presently to be cited, that Willey followed the ordinary descent of Turold's Manors, and that in the thirteenth Century it was, in some sort, held of the Fee of Chetwynd, and by Chetwynd under Fitz Alan. We must now speak of Hunnit who was a Saxon, and who having held Willey before the Conquest was permitted to retain it under a Norman Lord, and so had it in 1086. This continuous Saxon interest in the Manor was probably the cause of its n on -diminution of value since the time of Edward the Confessor, as well of its being cultivated to its full capability when the Domesday Commissioners took their account of it. Hunnit and his Brother Uluiet had in Saxon times held other 8 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. the Empress Maud, which will have followed in 1141. This \"History,\" speaking of Robert son of Turold adds, \" qui e. h\u00e6res ipsius est,\" as if he were then living. 9 That Charter of Shrewsbury Abbey which has just been quoted as the \" H is toria Fundationis,\" is a statement of the possessions of that house, drawn up apparently in the beginning of Stephen's reign ; for it recites that King's Con firmation, which must have passed about 1136, but does not notice the Charter of The Feodary of 1165 contains, under Fitz Alan's Barony, no name and tenure which I can suggest as likely to represent the \" Fee of Chetwynd.\""], [547, "49 WILLEY. Shropshire Manors besides Willey. In two of these, viz. Moreton and Preston, Hunnit was. still Turold's tenant in 1086. In a third, Lawley, he also held under Turold. but the Saxon owner of that Manor is not particularized in Domesday, though probably it was he. Tbe usual Norman policy, when a Saxon was allowed to retain any land at all, was to assign it elsewhere than in those localities where its possession wrould be accompanied by the influ ence of old associations.10 This policy had not as yet been adopted, in 1086, against Hunnit ; but there is strong presumption that eventually he was thus dealt with. Toret, another Saxon, and Hunnit's contemporary, had held six Shropshire Manors in the time of King Edward. Three of these he retained in 1086, and perhaps had some interest in a fourth. His total loss of other two seems to have been compensated by his feoffment in a seventh Manor, where he had held nothing previously. Toret was succeeded, by at least two generations in the male line. His estates then passed with a female to Corbet of Wattles boraugh; but the extraordinary feature of this succession is, that whatever can be traced to have so passed to Toret's heirs was not Toret's at Domesday, but rather Hunnit's and Uluiet's. Consistently with this fact we observe that Toret, having held nothing under Turold at Domesday , was yet a witness of Robert Fitz Turold's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey before 1121. We naturally infer that before the same period, Toret had succeeded Hunnit or Uluiet, or both, in certain tenures under Turold or his Son ; Willey however was not of the number, and that Manor is no further involved in this ques tion than that if, according to a recognized policy, Hunnit lost his interest in several of his Domesday Manors, he probably lost it in all. Willey then, not passing from Hunnit or his heirs to Toret or his heirs, nor yet remaining in any succession of Hunnit, would seem to have been transferred to a new Feoffee, the Ancestor of a family which took name from the place. And this same family inherited other estates, held of the \" Fee of Chetwynd,\" and with which neither Hunnit nor Toret had ever been concerned. Hence I conclude that the family of Wililey acquired its feoffments in the \" Fee of Chetwynd,\" not by any right of inheritance, but solely by favour of the Chief Lord. mis-stated.

That which I have further to say of Willey will best be intro duced by a Pedigree, and some account of the successive members of the family which took its name from this acquisition of the Manor. \u2014 Among the Laymen who were Assessors to the Viceroy of the County when, about a. d. 1115, he presided over the great Archi diaconal Chapter, already mentioned11 as having been held at Castle Holgate, was one, evidently of rank, but who, according to a common usage at the time, is described only by his Christian name, \u2014 Wabnerius. Him I am inclined to take for the Ancestor of the family of Wililey, though on the slight evidence of name and position. The name Warner was uncommon at the period and by no means identical with Warin. The distinction between the two, though afterwards forgotten, was in the twelfth century carefully observed ; indeed it is so observed in the very document which I am quoting. Neither name was Saxon, and I have found that of Warner used by no contemporary family of distinction, and likely to have been represented at Castle Holgate on this occasion, except that of De Wililey.12 If this Warner were indeed Lord of Willey, he will have survived the only occasion on which he occurs but for a short time. A very curious deed, dated aj>. 1120, by which Peter, Prior of Wenlock, grants certain rights in Beckbury to Walter Fitz Warin, is attested inter alios by Hugh de Welileia, Turold, and Warner de Becheberi.13 Besides this recurrent distinction between the names of Warner and Warin, it is singular that Hugh de Welileia, whom I take to have been surely Lord of Willey, and then Feoffee of Robert Fitz Turold, should be followed in his attestation by one named Turold.14 By no means identifying the latter with Turold de Verley,who, if living, would have preceded his Tenant in any testing- 11 Vol. I, pp. 217, 223. 14 A very ancient Charter of Buildwas Abbey (in possession of George Pritchard, Esq. of Broseley), which passed within twenty years of this period (1120), is tested, inter alios, by \" Thurold de Main nio.\" He may be the Turold who at tested in 1120, but I can say nothing more of the person indicated under either denomination. 12 There was indeed a contemporary Warner de Beckbury, as we shall presently see, but he was not Lord of Beckbury, nor does he appear under any such cir cumstance as would tally with the pre sumptively high position of an Assessor to the Viceroy. 13 Register of Wenlock Priory (at Wil- ey), so. 6."], [549, "51 WILLEY.

Passing over the next sixty years, no extraordinary hiatus in the manorial or genealogical details of the twelfth century, we arrive at the year 1180, when : \u2014 Warner de Williley, son perhaps or grandson of Hugh, was undoubtedly Lord of Willey. With him all obscurity of descent at once vanishes. In that year he was assessed by the Justices of the Forest, at 2 shillings, for some charge within their jurisdiction, and probably arising from the proximity of Willey to the Royal Haye of Shirlot.15 About the same time, for I cannot assign any more probable date to the transaction now to be mentioned, Warner de Wilile stands at the head of the nine witnesses who seem to have been present on behalf of Wenlock Priory when Gervase Paganel \" offered on the Altar of St. Mylburg,\" the Charter by which he endowed the subject Priory of Dudley and ratified its dependence on the Shrop shire House.16 Within nine years of his first appearance, i.e. before the year 1199, Warner de Wililey contracted a marriage which, realizing an immediate and considerable addition to his property, brought, in consequence of the eventual heirship of his wife, still greater benefits to his posterity. The period of his marriage and the family and fortune of his wife will best be indicated by the following Charter : \u2014 15 Forest Rolls at Westminster, No. 1, In thus confidently stating the date of Pope Lucius' Bull I should add that it is itself dated on the 16th of the Calends of July, in the year of the Incarnation 1190, the 15th year of the Indiction, and the first year of the Grantor's Pontificate.\" This clause, however inconsistent, esta blishes the date which I have given above, viz. June 16, 1182, though the Editors of the Monasticon have been satisfied with 1190, which was the eighth year of the Indiction and the fifth after the death of Pope Lucius. I have before remarked on the preference which in these dating clauses should be given to anything rather than the dominical year (Vol. I, p. 250). In the present instance the Indictional and Papal year being consistent, point conclusively to a. d. 1182. memb. 2. 16 Monasticon, v, 84, No. 2. This deed apparently contains a double testing clause. The first consists of the Baron of Dudley's Retainers, the last of persons appearing in other Charters in the Court of the Prior of Wenlock. The date which I assign to the Charter should be accounted for. Pope Lucius III confirmed Gervase Paganel's Foun dation in its chief particulars on June 16, 1182, as we learn from another Charter (Ibidem, p. 83, No. 1). Also out of the eight witnesses who, be sides Warner de Wilile, attest on the part of Wenlock Priory, six are sound to attest a feoffment by Prior Robert, who succeeded about 1176."], [551, "53 WILLEY. \"William, son of William Fitz-Alan, certifies that he has conceded to Warner de Wilileia, together with Petronilla daughter of Roger Fitz Odo,17 and to their heirs, the donation, which Thomas Fitz Odo made to them, of Keneleia (Keuley), and one hide in Gro tintun (Gretton) with the Mill, in frank marriage, as (the said donation) was made at Salop, in full County, and in his (Fitz Alan's) presence. \u2014 Witnesses : Hugh Pantulf, Sheriff, Robert Corbet, William de Wudeton, Robert de Giros, Richard de Costen tin, Adam Salvage, Peter Fitz Toret, Master Walter de Dunstanvill, Master Adam de Bromfeld, and many others, both Knights and Gentlemen (Liberis hominibus).\"18 The Shrievalty of Hugh Pantulf alone determines this deed to have passed in the County-Court between Michaelmas 1179 and Michaelmas 1189. The estate thus settled upon Warner de Wililey and Petronilla his wife was further assured to them by a fine levied at West minster in June 1194. The Record gives this very early fine as follows. \u2014 Thomas Fitz Odo and Roger his Brother, Tenants, and Warner de Wilileia and Petronilla his wife, were accorded concerning the land of Keinleia with its appurtenances and concerning 1 hide of land in Grotington and the Mill, so as that the whole land and Mill shall remain to Warner and Petronilla for ever; for 2 merks which the same Warner gave them.19 17 It is a most extraordinary circum stance that this Petronilla, wife of Warner de Wililey, is stated in an equally authentic document (a fine of 6 Hen. Ill) to have been daughter and heir of Her bert de Rushbury. The latter was doubt less of the family of Fitz Odo, but that does not clear the difficulty. I willingly postpone a solution of so perplexing a matter. but in whose custody the originals then were he does not say. Their presumed loss is all but compensated by the un rivalled excellence of Dugdale's tran scripts ; for the King of Heralds and Antiquaries condescended to write legibly and to copy fully and carefully. Such are the documents which I shall quote, after this explanation, simply as \" Lacon Evidences.\" 13 The original of this Charter is not known to be in existence. The copy from which I make extract is in Vol. xxxix of Dugdale's MSS. in the Ashmolean Li brary, Oxford. It is accompanied by transcripts of other Charters and Evi dences, described by Dugdale as having in 1583 been in possession of Rowland Lacon, Esq. of Willey. Of course Dug dale copied them in the following century, 19 Placita apud Westm., entitled as \" incerti temporis Regis Ricardi,\" memb. 2 dorso. Some extracts from this Roll are printed in the Abbreviatio Placitorum (pp. 96, 97) and ascribed to \" an un certain period of King John's reign.\" The internal and other evidence (part of which is implied above) proves the Roll to have been of Trinity Term, 5 Richard I (1194). It is one of those which owing"], [552, "54 WILLEY. The sum thus paid by Warner, as well as the fact that Thomas and Roger Fitz Odo are described as Tenants in the preamble of this fine, would induce a supposition that the grant implied by Fitz Alan's Charter had not been, in the first instance, fully conveyed, nor without some litigation. Notwithstanding this fine of June 1194, the supposed dispute was renewed in November of the same year and again settled by Warner's allegation of the previous concord. In subsequent years there were other law proceedings affecting the details rather than the principle of the original grant ; but these particulars belong rather to Kenley where I propose to give them. It is sufficient here to say that Warner de Wililey again in 1204, alleged the fine of Trinity Term 5 Rich. I, and again obtained judgment in a suit then pending. To return to the reign of Richard I. I have already alluded to a composition which about the year 1196 passed between the Dean of Brug and the Prior of Wenlock ; Warner de Wililey was a witness, and doubtless on the part of the Prior.20 His marriage, above mentioned, involved a considerable tenure under the house of Fitz Alan. William Fitz Alan II, was at this period Sheriff of Shropshire, and from Michaelmas 1198 to Michael mas 1200, Warner de Wililey acted as his Deputy. For the next ten years he appears variously interested in the concerns of that Baron, attesting his Charters or acting as his Attorney. In 1203, being a Knight, he sat as Juror on several causes of Grand Assize. In 1219, I find him appointed as a Justice to make inquiry con cerning assarts and purprestures in the Royal Forests of Shrop shire.21 Such being his station and trusts, he appears in 1221 as convicted of an act of oppression and treachery which even in that day was marked with some weight of legal animadversion. Coveting another man's land, and that man his own Vassal, whom he was bound to protect, he contrived that his Dependant should appear guilty of a fictitious but capital crime. By information of Petronilla, Warner's wife, the assumed Felon was arrested, and his chattels sold by a King's Bailiff.

However a fine of five merks released the greater culprit. \u2014 No crime at that day was without a fiscal equivalent. A criminal who could pay could not be punished.22 Thus ended a case, the motives and moral features of which had been typified in an older story,23 though here the successful crime and the monumental retribution are wanting to complete the parallel.

In the same year he was himself questioning the title by which Ralph, then Lord of Pichford, held that Manor.24 Warner de Wililey had now for forty-six years been a prominent person in the County. All that I need further to relate of him is implied in a deed whereby he and his wife Petronilla are said to have granted to William de Harley and Engelard a Chaplain (Feoffees in trust), their Manors of Gretton, Wilderhope, Walle under Heywode, Rushbury, Kenley and Williley, with the Ad vowsons of such Churches as were attached thereto.36 22 The circumstances of this cause shall be given more minutely under Kenley, where the coveted land lay. the second or sinister, viz. \u2014 Arms * * on a chief * two cinquefoils *.

The Feoffees, by another deed, regranted the premises (or most of them) to Warner and Petronilla in tail with remainder to the right heirs of Petronilla.26 All that I shall here say of this Heiress is that she survived her husband many years and was living at least as late as 1240. Nicholas, son and heir of Warner de Wililey, appears first in 1231, as having been amerced for inattention to his duties as a Regarder of the King's Forests. In 1233 and 1237, he is mentioned as a Juror of Grand Assize and a Knight. On the 10th of April 1241, he was serving the office of Under-Sheriff to John le Strange;37 and nothing further can I learn of him except that dying within the next fourteen years, he left a Widow Burga and a Son Andrew, then an Infant. Burga would appear to have obtained the wardship of her son from John de Chetwynd (obviously as seignoral Lord of Willey and other lands of Andrew's inheritance) . Five years before his Father's death, this young Heir had been married to a daughter of Walter de Hugford. In 1255, we have the following notice of the Manor of Willey as recorded by Jurors of the Liberty of Wenlock. \u2014 \" Andrew Fitz Nicholas is Lord of the vill of Wilileg, and holds it of the Prior of Wenlock and does due suit at the Court of the Prior, and his Ancestors used to do suit to the Hundred of Munslow till the time of King Richard.\" 28 This extract is noticeable on two grounds : first, that it makes no mention of Andrew de Wililey's still continued Minority; next, that it asserts the Prior's Seigneury over Willey as that of any ordinary feudal Lord. \u2014 The truth is, that the Jurisdictional or Hundredal Seigneury, originally an adjunct of the Palatine Earldom of Shropshire, had passed by grant of the Crown to Wenlock Priory, so that the Manor was in some sort held of the Prior ; but at the same time the ordinary feudal Seigncuiy, which involved the right of wardship, relief, and marriage, remained with Chetwynd as the representative not to be lightly questioned, neither can I think the deed which he saw to have been a forgery. names might prevent his detection of an inconsistency which would Strike a native Antiquary at once.

This will appear still clearer from the following. \u2014 At Salop Assizes, January 1256, Margery de Lacy sued Burga de Wililegh that she should surrender to said Margery, Andrew, son and heir of Nicholas de Wililegh, custody of whom Margery asserted to belong to herself, because Nicholas had held under her at Rushbury by half-a-Knight's-fee ; whereas Burga ever since Nicholas' death kept Andrew from thc Plaintiff, who was thereby damaged to the extent of .\u00a310. Burga appeared and called John de Chetewind to warranty, who also appeared, vouched the said ivarranty, and further called to warranty John Fitz Alan (his own Seigneur). Fitz Alan being present acknowledged the responsi bility, but said that, as regarded marriage of this heir, Margery could claim nothing, because the said heir had, five years before his father's death, been married by his said father to a daughter of Walter de Hugford, which Walter was present in Court and in seizin of the said heir. On this ground Fitz Alan asked the judgment of the Court in his favour, stating at the same time that he had other pleas to offer if this were not enough.30 Here the case was broken off, apparently for ulterior consideration ; but no result appears on the Rolls. Andrew de Wililey, when at length he came of age, associated himself with the malcontent party of that troubled period. His career was short and tragical. He fell on the field of Evesham on August 4, 1265, leaving an infant daughter, the inheritress of a forfeited estate. This estate, or rather the redemption money which under the Dictum de Kenilworth must be paid for the same before it could return to its lineal claimant, was granted by the Crown to Robert le Strange, a younger son of John third Baron Strange of Nesse and Cheswardine. Robert le Strange was one of those who in 1270 accompanied 29 In process of time the service ren dered by the Lord of Willey to the Prior of Wenlock became much extended. On June 26, 1338, \" Sir Robert de Harley came to Wenlock and before many wit nesses did his homage and fealty to Sir Guychard, Prior of Wenlock, and ac knowledged himself to hold the Manor of Williley of the said Lord Prior by service of carrying the frock of the same Prior to Parliament, and of doing suit every three weeks to the Hundred Court of Burton, and suit also to the two great Annual Hundred Courts of Burton.

He was dead Sept. 10, 1276,31 and being in debt to the Crown, Willey, with other estates of which he was something more than a Trustee, was again seized into the King's hands. Meanwhile Burga, the heiress of these unredeemed lands, had married Philip de Stapelton ; and in 1277, King Edward issued his precept to the Sheriff of Shropshire commanding him to take extent (valuation) of Willey, and when extended to deliver it to William de Stapleton, whose son Philip had married the said heiress; and William de Stapleton was to cultivate and sow it and render account to the King during the King's pleasure. A similar precept again issued in 1278, but in behalf of Philip de Stapleton himself.32 He however lived not long to discharge this trust. Before December 1283, Burga, sole daughter aud heir of Andrew de Williley, was wife of Richard de Harley, and to her posterity by him she transmitted the splendid and at length disencumbered inheritance. As this lady survived the date of her second marriage at least fifty-four years, a presumption arises that Philip de Stapleton had been only the husband of her infancy. As some later particulars which I have to give of Willey will be implied in my account of Harley and other Manors, I will here take leave of this part of the subject.33 The only under-tenancy which deserves notice in this Manor was that of Walter le Stalhere, who left two daughters and coheirs. On June 18, 1245, a fine wes levied at Westminster, whereby Alice, one of these coheirs, concurred with her husband William Marescall in conveying half a virgate in Wylleleg to Nicholas le Despenser and Christiana his wife, the other coheir. For this the Grantees paid five merks.34 This Nicholas le Despenser was suspected of unlawful interference with the King's venison. Specifically he was accused of having taken a stag in Shirlot Forest on Sunday July 6, 1253, but was not tried till the Forest Assizes of Feb. 1262, when he escaped the charge by a fine of 6s. 8d., for payment of which Richard le Yreis (Irish) of Davvley and Adam Traynel of Willey were his Sureties. 31 Claus 4, Edw.

The Advowson of this Church or Chapel was already a matter of litigation in the beginning of the 13th Century. In Hilary Term 1214, the Attorney of the Prior of Wenlock had essoign at Westminster, in a suit of dai~rein presentment which the Prior was prosecuting against Warner de Wilileg.36 Again in Michaelmas Term 1233, and probably on occasion of another vacancy here, there were several essoigns in a similar suit, which the same Prior had against Nicholas de Wilileg.30 The result of this litigation must be gathered from other documents than the Plea Rolls.\u2014 In 1291, the Church or Chapel of Wyleleye in the Deanery of Wenlock was valued at .\u20ac5. 6*. 8d. per annum. The Prior of Wenlock was not the Patron, nor was his receipt of any pension arising from this Church entered on the Record.37 The Church however is elsewhere stated to have been chargeable with a pension of 7*. payable annually on the day of the Transla tion of Saint Milburg (May 26) to the Priory Kitchen.38 An Inquisition of the year 1323-4 found this Church to be without cure, and that the person who should see to the performance of divine service here was the Vicar of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock.39 Flence the district which was taxed to the Ninth in 1341, under the title of \" The Chapel of Welyley,\" must not be understood as a distinct Parish, but as that territory (probably coextensive with the Manor) from which the Rector of Willey drew his endowment. On this occasion the said district was assessed at 40*. only, the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb therein being so much less than the endowment of the Church because of tempests and murrain, and because the glebe land, small-tithes and offerings, which went to swell the endowment, could not be taken into account in estimating the value of the ninth.40 37 Tax.

A valuation of 1379 puts the annual value of the Chapel of Wilileye at 10 merks (\u00a36. 13*. id.) and states it to belong to the Presentation of the Prior.41 In 1534, John Podmore being Rector of Wylley, his benefice was put at the old valuation of .\u20ac5. 6*. 8d. for glebe and tithes. The only charge specified thereon was 6d. per annum for Archdeacon's Synodals.42 Summarily then, the Church of Willey may be presumed to have been founded and endowed by the Lords of the Manor. It had no Parish, being within the Parish of Wenlock, but it was perhaps chargeable with a pension as an affiliation of Wenlock Church, and the Vicar of the latter was responsible for its service. The Rectors of Willey being without cure were probably non-resident. They were nominated by the Lords of Willey to the Prior of Wenlock and then presented by the latter to the Bishop of Hereford for institution. This mediate right of the Prior seems to have been in acknowledgment of the ancient ecclesiastical jurisdiction of St. Milburg, though the pension, which doubtless was an original part of the same reserved right, may have fallen into disuse.

He died in 1410. We now proceed to those constituents of the Domesday Hundred of Alnodestreu which went to form, probably in the time of Henry I, the newly created Hundred of Brimstree. One of these Manors was, within a century, again transferred to the Liberty of Wenlock ; and it will properly head this series, as thus following Broseley and Willey, which were similarly separated from their second Hundred of Munslow.

The word however, which enters into many names (and indeed the very name of which Dugdale was treating, viz. Browns-over), is more probably the Saxon noun-substantive Opep (a bank, brink, or shore), than the similarly written preposition, which is equivalent to the modern over. The variety of ways in which Badger was written in early times renders its further etymology a matter of some uncertainty. There are two Anglo-Saxon words which have, or may have had, an equal applicability to local circumstances. Beccer, the possessive case of Becc (a brook), would render the whole name intelligible as \"the bank of the brook,\" while Becer, the possessive case of Bece (a beech-tree) affords an equally apparent meaning and is perhaps the more genuine Anglo-Saxon word of the two. Osbern, who held the neighbouring Manors of Badger, Brockton, and Ryton, under Earl Roger, in 1085, was no other than Osbern Fitz Richard, Baron of Burford and Richard's Castle, whom we have already seen attesting the Earl's foundation of Quatford Church very shortly after Domesday.2 It will be better to speak of him and his house when we come to treat of his greater Domesday Fief, viz. that which he then held immediately of the Crown. His Manors in Alnodestreu Hundred will indeed have some time been annexed to his Tenure in capite ; but I find no hint of his successors retaining any such concern in Brockton or Ryton, as might be taken to represent his Domesday interests there. With Badger however it was otherwise, for the Inquisitions which, down to the time of Richard II, detail the possessions of the successive heirs of Osbern Fitz Richard's Barony, imply their continuous claim upon this Manor, though such claim probably amounted to nothing more than the payment of a small quit-rent. It is singular that except by these Inquisitions and the evidence of one or two private deeds, we should not have been able to identify Earl Roger's Tenant Osbern, with the powerful Baron whose name occupies other folios of the Domesday Record. Of Robert, Sub Tenant here, in 1085, I can say nothing further, nor whether he left descendants to inherit his interests. However, about the time of Henry II's accession, it would seem that one William de Begesour was tenant under Osbern Fitz Hugh, grand son of Osbern Fitz Richard above mentioned. The tenancy over > Supra, Vol. I, p. 111."], [561, "63 BADGER. this William, who very possibly may have been son or grandson of Robert, was granted by the said Osbern to Guy le Strange. Osbern Fitz Hugh made a return of his Barony in 1165, but it was sent back to him owing to some informality, and thus its contents are lost to posterity. Had this return been preserved, it would probably have contained a statement to the effect that Guy le Strange held something of new feoffment under the said Osbern. The loss of the document is in the present instance harmless, for that mixture of secondary evidence and analogy, which must often be our guide in these investigations, has enabled us to indicate the mode in which Guy le Strange and his heirs became Mesne-Lords of Badger. Hereby the history of another great family becomes associated with the place, but I postpone all detailed account of the descent of Guy le Strange to a future occasion. Some facts necessary to such fuller account will however be furnished by our present inquiry. The nature of the subinfeudation just alluded to is so well made out by contemporary documents as to merit particular attention. When Guy le Strange received feoffment here, the reserved rent payable by him to Osbern Fitz Hugh was probably 4*. Thenceforward whatever rent and service had been paid by William de Begesour to the same Osbern became due to Guy le Strange. Within a short period however this William sold his subtenancy to one Philip Fitz Stephen who thereupon became Le Strange's tenant. Of William de Begesour we shall hear again, inasmuch as he probably carried elsewhere and retained the name which he had derived from his original feoffment. Philip Fitz Stephen and his Successors, as the actual Tenants-in fee of Badger, will now constitute our proper subject, a subject rendered most clear by a very unusual concurrence of evidences. The Royal Forestership of Shirlot, a tenure in capite at Ackleton and Bardeley, Feoffments under the Priory of Wenlock, the Abbey of Shrewsbury, the families of Le Strange and De Haughton, an interest in the Borough of Bridgnorth, and (more than all) the careful preservation of a few early documents, \u2014 these are the circumstances which, while they supply facts and illustrations of John Talbot of Richards-Castle, (Calend.

The Grandfather of Philip Fitz Stephen, whose name however does not appear, held Ackleton, a member of the Royal Manor of Worfield in time of Henry I. The father of the said Philip, whose name was of course Stephen, succeeded to Ackleton in the same reign. Some dis turbance of this tenure very possibly took place in the time of the Usurpation. At all events the following document issued in the first ten years of the reign of Henry II, and was apparently elicited by some claim for restitution urged by, \u2014 Philip Fitz Stephen, the heir. The Royal Writ runs thus. \u2014 \" Henry King of England and Duke of Normandy and Aquitain and Earl of Anjou to his Sheriff and Ministers of Salopescire greeting. I enjoin you that ye cause recognition to be made by oath of lawful men of the vicinage, as to the kind of service by which Stephen father of my Forester Philip, and the grandfather (of the same Philip) held Acclinton, their land, in time of King Henry my grandfather : and that, when such recognition shall have been made, ye shall permit him so to hold it and with such comparative advantage and freedom, both in waters and meadows and pastures, and by the same service.

We have also seen him (each year, from 1169 till 1173 inclusive) discharging the trust of Visor, or Inspector, of the Sheriffs' expenditure on the works of Brug Castle. In the year 1174, Guy le Strange being Sheriff and still con tinuing an outlay on these works, Philip Fitz Stephen ceases to act 4 Charter in possession of R. H. Cheney, Esq. of Badger. The date as signed above to this early document is thus arrived at. William de Beauchamp was obviously the contemporary Sheriff of Worcestershire, a man much trusted by Henry II. The King can hardly have been at Worcester at any time of Beau champ's Shrievalty after 1164. Further, of the numerous attestations of Manasser Biset (he was Lord of Kidderminster) none appear later than 1165. Henry was at Worcester in 1157, and again at Easter 1158, when both Manasser Biset and William de Beauchamp were with him. A precept, of very similar character to this, issued from Rouen to Richard de Luci, and is tested singly by Manasser Biset (Bibl. Cott. Claud, b. vi, p. 174).

About 1196, this Philip, at length called Philip de Beggesour, attests in a prominent position the composition about Ditton Church which I have so often alluded to. The following Fine, illustrative of a very ancient mode of legal procedure, relates, I doubt not, to a title which this Philip de Bagesore had to land in an adjoining Manor. The document runs thus. \u2014 * \" This is the final concord made in the Court of the Lord King at Westminster on Thursday next after the Octaves of St. Hilary in the seventh year of the reign of King Richard (i.e. on Jan. 25, 1196) before H.

And Ralph hath quit-claimed to Philip the other moiety, to hold of the Capital Lord.\"8 This technical language requires some explanation. \u2014 Philip de Bechesore held a hide of land in Beckbury under the Lord of that Manor. His right to do so was challenged by Ralph de Herleton. The question was adjudged to be settled by duel. Philip (a very old man) acted in this phase of the litigation by his (younger) son Reginald. The duel was fought and probably without any such decided result as was believed to constitute the \"judgment of heaven \" in such matters. So after these solemn appeals to the law and to Eternal justice, the case was settled by the modern, and simple, though seldom honest mode*of \" splitting the difference.\" Philip Fitz Stephen of Badger was at this period, as I have intimated, a very old man, indeed there is evidence of Roger, his eldest son and heir, having sat in the County Court before the date of the final-concord just quoted.9 This Roger de Bechesore, whose succession to his Father Philip cannot be put much later than 1196, occurs in various relations. As a Tenant of Salop Abbey at Astley he appears twice in Charters of that House, which passed during the time of Abbot Hugh (1190-1218), and related to its affairs in the said Manor.10 He stands first witness to a grant which Haughmond Abbey had at Rudge.11 As a Knight and accompanied by his heirs he attests a Charter of Ralph de Sanford which concerned land at Brockton, and must have passed between 1205 and 1220.13 To the Abbey of Lilleshall and the Priory of Wenlock he was himself a Grantor.

His Charter to Wenlock Priory is still in existence. \u2014 Calling him self Roger son of Philip de Beggeshore, he grants to God and to St. Mylburg of Weciel and to the Monks there serving God, for the health of his soul and the souls of his Ancestors and Suc cessors, in pure and perpetual almoigne, 10*. of his Mill of Beggeshore, for the kitchen of the Brethren, to be paid annually at two terms, viz. 5*. at the Feast of St. Andrew and other 5*. at the Feast of St. John Baptist. The deed purports to be sealed with the grantor's seal and is attested singly by Warin de Burwardell.14 It is here proper to state that Wenlock Priory must have had manorial rights at Badger from time immemorial, and that the Wenlock fee of Badger was originally distinct from the Richards- Castle fee. Nevertheless, the latter only is mentioned in Domes day. The tenants of the two seem to have been identical at all recorded periods.15 The grant last quoted must have followed immediately on the period when the Prior of Wenlock was enabled much to strengthen his Seigneury at Badger j \u2014 a consequence of the Manor being transferred from the Hundred of Brimstree to the Prior's new Franchise of Wenlock. Thus the subsequent Lords of Badger are stated indifferently to hold the Manor of the heirs of Le Strange and of the Prior of Wenlock. And their service to the latter was much the most onerous of the two, being, I suppose, partly in com position of that attendance at the Prior's lesser Hundred Court of Burton which was exacted, every three weeks, from Manors less remote.

This will appear more evidently in regard to Badger, otherwise I should offer a fuller explanation when thus assuming any inaccuracy of Domes day. Much of St. MUburg's land was not assessable to Danegeld, and this immunity may have withheld some Manors, or parts of Manors, from recognition of the Com missioners. Neither the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1534, nor the Ministers' Accounts of 1541, mention this charge upon Badger-Mill among the receipts of Wenlock Priory. Lord Forester's Register has however (fos. 32, 33) a curious Rent Roll of the Priory-Kitchen, taken apparently in the years 1495-6.

He left two sons, Thomas and Philip. Thomas the eldest married (about 1225) Margery daughter of Adam de Beysin. Also, on succession, he obtained a Charter of Confirma tion from the Prior of Wenlock, which illustrates the nature of the seigneury exercised by the latter over Badger, and shows how in dependent it was of the seigneury of Le Strange's Heirs. By this deed, already printed,21 \"Brother Humbert Prior of Weneloch confirms to Thomas de Begelhovere and his heirs the vill of Begelhovere, of the Fee of Saint Milburg, with all its appur tenancies; to hold to him and his heirs, of the Prior and his Suc cessors, for his homage and for the'same service by which his Father Roger held it, viz. for 20*. payable annually at Michaelmas, and for suit to be done to the Court of St. Milburg by afforciament of Court.\" The witnesses were, Philip de Burwardel (uncle of the Grantee's wife), Robert de Wodetun, Hugh de Beckebur, Adam de Beising (the Grantee's Father-in-law), Hugh de Lega, &c. Philip, younger brother of this Thomas, seems to have held under him that land at Beckbury which has already been mentioned twice. Philip surrendered his tenancy under circumstances of some interest. \u2014 His deed of surrender runs thus : \u2014 \" Know all men that I Philip de Beggesoure have reudered and quit-claimed to Thomas de Beggesoure my brother, his heirs and assigns, all my land in Bechebiri which I held of him (that namely which Reginald and William le Sage held under me), \u2014 for five merks of silver which the said Thomas hath given me for my journey to Jerusalem. \u2014 Witnesses : Sir Walter de Huggeford, Walter de Bealmeis, Adam de Beysin, Roger de Subiri, John de Beckebiri, Walter de Eudinas (Ewdness), Eudo de Rugge (Rudge), Robert de Alditone, Thomas de Aclitone (Ackleton), &c.22 The witnesses' names alone would enable us to determine the period of this transaction within a few years, but we learn its exact date in another way. \u2014 Philip de Beggesoure was undoubtedly one 19 Rot.

Matthew Paris tells us that from England alone 60,000 fighting men set out on that Crusade and that most of them were poor. Their outset was accompanied by a celestial sign on the night of St. John the Baptist (June 24) .2S The expedition failed owing to the vacillation of the Emperor Frederick, who however after being excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX, landed at Acre in September 1228. Here he found an army of 90,000 men of all nations, and among them the English Bishops of Winchester and Exeter. Jerusalem surrendered to the Christian arms early in 1229. I can say little more of Thomas de Baggesore. In Michaelmas Term 1228, he was sued with many others who held messuages in the town of Newport (which was Royal Demesne) as to his title to the same ; but the result does not appear.24 He was also possessed of houses and land in the High Street and in the fields of Brug. The former he sold for the large sum of twenty-four merks to Robert son of Philip Fitz Thorold, reserving to himself a chief rent of white gloves payable at Brug at the fair of the vill, viz, at the feast of St. Mary Magdalene.26 The time of Thomas de Baggesour's death I cannot further determine than that it was before March 1246, when his son Philip will presently appear as Lord of Badger. Besides the said Philip, Thomas left other issue, and his wife Margery surviving. She having brought Ashfield in frank marriage to her husband, disposed of it some years after his death to her younger children. She was living in 1255. In 1246, Philip Lord of Beggesovere, who will have then lately attained his majority, was involved in a dispute with Alan, Rector of the Parish, who claimed the tithe of hay in all meadows within the same. The matter was settled on March 29, in the Church of Long Stanton before William de Ros, Clerk of the Bishop of Hereford, Roger, Dean of Sypton, and a full Chapter.

About this time Philip de Baggesour married, and without license of the Crown, a step which afterwards caused him some trouble. Matthew Paris speaks of the memorable Iter whereby Geoffrey de Langley and his Fellow Justices of the Forest enriched the King's Exchequer and impoverished his subjects.27 The Chronicler seems to place their visit to the Northern Counties in the Summer of 1250. They held pleas and made arrentations in Shropshire somewhat earlier. Among other sufferers Philip de Baggesore was deprived of his Forestership of Shirlot on account of his illegal marriage. He fined with the King in a sum of 20 merks \" for the same marriage and for having the Bailiwick of the Forest of Shirlot which his Father Thomas had had.\" A Royal Writ, dated Jan. 21, 1250, allows him to pay the said fine at the rate of 100*. per annum.-9. The Inquisitions of Hundreds in 1255 exhibit this Philip in various relations,29 viz. as holding half the Manor of Cleobury- North, under Robert de Haluchton, as holding four virgates in capite at Bardeley, and as Forester of the Fee in the King's free Haye of Schyrlet, where, says the Record, \" he has under him two Foresters, viz. William de Bottesfeld and John his Brother, who give said Philip 20s. per annum for holding their office ; and they make a levy on oats (fields sown with oats) in Lent, and on wheat in Autumn : and the aforesaid Philip hath in the said haye, of wind-falls as much as seven trees, and likewise the dead trees which are wind-fallen, the Jurors know not by what warrant except that of ancient tenure.\" The Wenlock Jurors, of whom Philip himself was one, returned him as Lord of the vill of Bagesover, and that he held it of the Prior of Wenlock and paid 30*. per annum to the Prior, and did suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament, and that his ancestors used to do suit to the Hundred of Brimestre till King Richard's time. These Jurors estimated at four hides the united Manors of Badger, Beckbury, and Madeley.30 The Domesday measure was however greater, viz. half a hide, one hide, and four hides respectively, or five-and-a-half hides collectively.

The Verdict of the Jurors sets forth most clearly that co-ordinate seigneury which existed over the Lords of Badger. The deceased, they said, had held the vill of the Prior of Wenlock at an annual rent of 20*., and land therein of Henry de Harecourt (a de scendant of Le Strange), at an annual rent of half a merk. The tenure under Harcourt is measured at two virgates of land and five acres of wood, probably the exact Domesday estimate. He also heldAclinton of Sir Henry de Hastings (then Lord of Worfield), by service of 60*. per annum. Badger was worth \u00a33. 5s. Q\\d. per annum. Ackleton was worth \u00a32. 10*. 6\\d. Philip's tenancies at Bardeley and Cleobury-North are further particularized. The Inquest concludes with finding that Pliilip was his son and next heir, and was eleven years of age, and that all his lands were in the King's hand.31 It does not appear that the Crown asserted any right of wardship over this heir, whose fealty for Bardeley was accepted shortly after as a tenure in socage. \u2014 The Escheator had the King's precept, dated 5th Feb. 1259, to give Philip, son of Philip de Bagesouere, livery thereof after taking security for his relief of 6*.33 Payment of that sum is acknowledged by the Sheriff in his account of Michaelmas 1260.33 This was that Philip Lord of Baggesovere who, about the year 1267-8, in other words as soon as he was of age, sold his tenure at Astley to Salop Abbey. The particulars have been already given except that at the time of the grant he appears to have been married.34 It will appear hereafter, under Alveley, how Ralph Noel, a descend ant of Guy le Strange, became entitled to half the chief- rent origin ally reserved by the same Guy when he enfeoffed Philip Fitz Stephen in Badger. It is also supposable that Ralph Noel, thus receiving 3*. id. per annum on Badger, paid half the capital chief-rent of 4*. reserved to the Lords of Richards-Castle. Ralph Noel sold his rent, with the liabilities attached thereto, to William de Hempton.

He doubtless bought up the other moiety also, as will appear by the Inquisition ou his death. Having, iu January 1291, presented Philip his younger Son (who could not have been more than twelve years old) to Badger Church, he died within a few months. On the 26th of October following King Edward's Writ of diem clausit extremum, issued from Aber gavenny to Malcolumb de Harley (then Escheator citra Trent) commanding him to hold Inquest on the death of Philip de Brachesovere. The Jurors met at Brug ou Nov. 19, 1291, and found as follows, viz. \u2014 That besides his Tenures at Bardeley, North Cleobury, and Cold- Weston, the Deceased had held a certain Baili wick of Shirlot Forest, not of the Crown (that is not of ancient demesne) but of the King's Escheat through (forfeiture of) Robert de Belesme ; \u2014 that the office was worth 13*. id. per annum, and that neither Philip nor his Ancestors had done other service for the same than fealty to the Chief Forester of Shropshire.36 \" He had also held of the Prior of Wenlock one messuage and four-and-a-half virgates of land in Baggesore, at a rent of 30*.37 aud the tenure was altogether worth 70*.\" \" He had also held of the heir of Robert de Mortimer of Richards- 35 Charter at Badger, \u2014 attested by Sir William de Huggeford, John le Poer, Alan de Glazeley, Richard de Bagesore (Uncle of the Grantor I think), William de Pilarditon, Robert de Dodinton, and others. The Poers were Lords of Roms ley, which they held by service of one Knight's Fee under the Barons of Richards-Castle. Badger is sometimes included in this Knight's Fee. If properly so, then Le Poer will have been mediate between the Baron of Richard's Castle and Le Strange's coheirs. But I never find Le Poer's interest operating at Badger, in fact it will have been at any time little more than nominal. bar any claim which the Crown might as sert to wardship of the heir. 37 The contemporary Taxation of Pope Nicholas (page 164) gives among the Temporalities of Wenlock a rent of only \u00a31. as receivable from Baggesoure, but. the above estimate includes 10.. rent charge on the Mill. Lord Forester's Re gister contains two memoranda of the fealty acknowledged, in 1502 and 1507, by Thomas and Henry Petyt, then re spectively succeeding to Badger.

A pension also (for thc due payment of which this mediate right of Presentation enabled the Prior to exact fealty and security from each nominee) was reserved to Wenlock. Such were in this instance the remains of the ancient spiritual jurisdiction of St. Milburg. The Formula by which a Prior of Wenlock presented any nominee of the \" Real Patron \" of this Church is preserved. It addresses the Bishop of Hereford, or his Vicar General, and recites that the Nomination to the Parochial Church or Curative Chapel of Badger belongs to A. B. (the Lord of Badger) by reason of a concession canonically made thereof by the Prior's predecessors. It further alleges an existent vacancy, and concludes by presenting C. B. (as nominated by A. B. to the Prior) to the Bishop, for admission ; \" saving to us a pension of 40c?. which in ancient times was wont to be paid to our house.\"42 This form seems to have been used in 1524 by Roland Prior of Wenlock when presenting a Clerk to Charles Booth, then Bishop of Hereford. \u2014 It explains not only what follows as regards Badger Church, but gives us the ratio of many similarly mediate rights of presen tation. In 1291, this Chapel is merely entered as being of less than _\u00a34. annual value. It was therefore not assessable ; nor is the Prior's pension mentioned.43 On May 23, 1331, Thomas (Charlton) Bishop of Hereford, in course of a Visitation, was at Wenlock. On this occasion the Prior exhibited his titles to a number of spiritual claims, which were duly examined, and pronounced to be satisfactory by a Charter of the same Bishop dated at Morville, on May 27 following. Among these recognized rights are, \" the Pensions which the Prior and Convent are receiving in the Churches or Chapels of Glazeleye, Maddeleye, Parva Wenlock, Bechebury, Bagesore, Wilileye, and Borewardesleye.\" In the Assessment of Parishes (a.d. 1341 **) neither Badger nor ',2 Register at Willey, so. 25, b. 43 Pope Nicholas' Taxation, p. 167. b. \" Ecclesia de Baddeshovere (in Decanatu de Wenlak) non valet \u00a34.\" 44 Rot.

Jan. 28, 1291, the Prior and Convent of Wenlock presented by their letter patent, Philip de Baggesore, Clerk, to the vacant Church ; which letter Philip, Father of the Presentee, exhibited to the Bishop, requesting him to show favour to his son iu the premises. To whom the Bishop replied, that he would commend the Church to some good Priest till he should see fit to order otherwise ; to which arrangement Philip (whose right it was to present a fit Parson to the Prior and Convent that they again should present the same to the Bishop, whenever the Church were vacant) fully acceded.47 June 19, 1308. Martin de Wistanestowe, Priest, was admitted on Presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock. Jan. 27, 1316.

June 22, 1344, and on July 28, 1344, it was found by Inquisition that Philip Lord of Bagsore, was the true Patron, exercising his right through the Prior of Wenlock ; that Anabella, Philip's Mother, last presented ; and that the \" Cure of souls at Badger remained with the Vicar of the Holy Trinity of Wenlock.\" \u2014 John, son of John Lord of Beckbury, aged twenty-five years and more, was accordingly presented by the said Philip, and admitted by the Bishop. \u2014 There was an informality in this. Wenlock Priory being at this time in the King's hands, in consequence of the war with France, its mediate right of Patronage should have been exercised by the Crown. The King however, being ignorant of any presentation having been made, and conceiving the right to belong ordinarily to Wenlock, presented John Wotenhull in the following year (1345).48 Wotenhull immediately attempted to oust Beckbury, and at this juncture Philip de Bagsore the Patron died. The matter con sequently remained in dispute two years, when \" William de Bagesore, Lord of the Manor of Bagesore, petitioned the King, showing that nomination to the Chapel belonged to the Lordship, and that all his Ancestors had immemorially presented a Clerk to the Prior and Convent of Wenlock, who had nominated the same Clerk to the Bishop, and that Philip, the Petitioner's father, not aware that the right of the Priory was in the Crown because of the war, had on a late vacancy presented John de Beckbury to the Prior, who presented to the Bishop, who instituted the said John.\" The King hereupon issued a Patent revoking his presentation of Wotenhull.49 After the death of John de Beckbury, and on \u2014 March 23, 1349, the King, addressing J. Bishop of Hereford, presents Hugh Carles, Clerk, to the \" Chapel of Baggesovere, as being nominated to us by William de Baggesore, to whom it appertains so to nominate to us, seeing that the Priory of Wenlock is in our hands by reason of the war.\" 50 The Bishop's Admission of Hugh Carles, date April 7, 1349, recites the above Patent.

Here is a mill rendering viii horse loads of fine wheat (siliginis). In time of King Edward (the Con fessor) the Manor was worth xxx shillings (per annum) . Now it is worth xx shillings. He (Osbern) found it waste.\" 3 I have already said that of the three Alnodestreu Manors held by Osbern Fitz Richard under Earl Roger in 1086, no interest in two seems to have passed to his descendants. We have scanty means of judging how this disseverance happened, and no hint as to any forfeiture, partial or general, having befallen the early Barons of Richards-Castle. True it is that Osbern Fitz Richard joined in the rebellion of 1188, when Wulstan Bishop of Worcester so ably maintained the cause of William Rufus in the West ; but then the chiefest 51 Hereford Registers (BlakewayMSS).

Hence the | restitution of all its rights of Patronage. 2 Domesday, so. 257, b. 2. 1 Dugdale's Warwickshire (Thomas's Edition, i, 46)."], [579, "81 RYTON if not the most open of the Revolutionists was the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury himself, and he was freely pardoned. His less politic Vassal may however have suffered a partial forfeiture even in a dis trict where his interests were associated with those of so influential a Suzerain. Another hypothesis, as to this and some similar and early dismemberments of great Fiefs, remains to be offered. There can be no question that the original Norman settlement of this County involved all the ordinary feudal tenures, as well those by Knight's service as by Castle-Guard and Petit Serjeantry of other kinds. The Shropshire Domesday however takes no notice of such lia bilities, as attaching to particular Manors ; and indeed these details hardly seem appropriate to a Census which had for its object the ascertainment of gross rather than net value and extent. The silence of Domesday as to conditions of tenure does not, in short, imply the non-existence of such conditions at the time when the Survey was taken. It is therefore very possible that to Osbern Fitz Richard's tenure of Ryton and Brockton services were attached, in 1086, identical or similar with those which were afterwards exacted from the Tenants of those Manors. It is further very possible that a Baron, the bulk of whose Fief lay in distant parts of this, or in other Counties, might find some outlying Manors a mere incum brance; in other words, that the services with which they happened to be charged were more than they were worth to him. In such cases a direct surrender or a neglect to comply with the terms of tenure would lead to the same result, viz. a reversion of the Manor or Manors in question to the Suzerain. Thus, as I appre hend, did Osbern Fitz Richard's tenure of Ryton and Brockton cease, and those Manors become subject to the re-disposal of the Norman Earl or of the Crown. That which I have next to offer about Ryton amounts to little more than a choice between two possible alternatives, one of which seems however to be recommended by some external evidence. Before the death of King Henry I, and probably by that Monarch, it was granted as the whole or part of a Knight's Fee either to one whom I shall presently notice as Engelard de Stretton, or else to some one from whom the said Engelard inherited. If the former, then Engelard must have survived his feoffment at least forty-three years (a thing not impossible in itself, but which implies either an unusually early advancement or an extraordinary longevity of the Feoffee) : if the latter, then the descent from the first Feoffee to 11 ,"], [580, "82 RYTON Engelard will have been through a female, for Engelard (being a younger son of his Father) can have inherited nothing except through his Mother, she not being the Mother of his elder Brother. And the latter theory will become more probable from a fact, which will presently appear, viz. that Engclard's successors at Ryton were the descendants of his Sister and not those of his elder Brother. It is obvious therefore, according to all ordinary rules of succession, that the said Sister was his uterine Sister, and that the fact which excluded their elder Brother from this inheritance must have been his non-participation in the whole blood of his Father's younger children. This Engelard de Stretton was a man of great importance in his day ; and as Ryton was his only, or principal, tenure in capite, it is fitting here to relate all that I can learn of him. Some scattered evidences, which when brought together will explain each other, should suffice also to show that what I have above advanced without references is not therefore mere theory. Engelard de Stretton was, as I suppose, younger Son of that Ralph de Pichford of whom we have already heard as a Tenant in capite, and as having distin guished himself by essential services to King Henry I during the siege of Brug Castle in 1102. His elder Brother, Richard de Pichford, succeeded their presumed Father, Ralph, not only in several Manors which had formed the Domesday Fief of Norman Venator, but also in that addition at Little Brug with which King Henry rewarded the zeal of his Follower. Before the year 1157, Richard de Pichford and Engelard his Brother are witnesses to a deed whereby William Fitz Alan (I) and certain of his Vassals concurred in granting Sundorn to Haghmon Abbey.3 Also before 1157, when Richard de Pichford gave to the same house a hide of land in Brome (near Ellesmere), Engelard his Brother was present and (being I suppose Tenant thereof) con sented. Again, after the said Richard's death, and before 1172, \" Engelard de Stretton\" makes an independent grant of this hide of land, adding thereto the site of a Mill.4 Richard de Pichford dying I suppose in 1157, and leaving his son, another Richard, under age, the latter, as a Tenant in capite, became a ward of the Crown. At Michaelmas 1157, the following 3 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 213. 4 Ib. so. 40, and Harl. MSS. 3868, so. 11."], [581, "83 RYTON entry occurs on the Shropshire Pipe Roll: \u2014 \"Engelard renders account of 20 merks for custody of the land of his Nephew.\" He had in fact bought the wardship from King Henry II ; and he paid the said fine in this and the following year.5 Thus much for the family and relations of Engelard ; and next for the reason of his being called \" de Stretton\" rather than \" dc Pichford.\" This will appear most satisfactorily. Within a few months of the accession of Henry II, he (Engelard) was made Castellan of Stretton, then a Royal Fortress and Manor. The Manor, fiscally reputed to be worth \u00a3i. per annum, furnished his Salary. Hence the following charge made by the Sheriff of Shropshire on the King's Revenue in 1156, viz. \"To Engelard, Custos of the Castle, \u00a3i. in Stratton.\" And each Sheriff till the year 1 1 77 repeats this annual charge as' of _\u00a34. bestowed \" in custody of Stratton Castle.\" In the Summer of the latter year, this Salary was augmented to one of _\u00a320. per annum chargeable on Wellington, Edgmoud, and Stretton, and at the same time another Castellan than Engelard is named. The probable reason of this will appear presently. To show Engelard de Stretton's connexion with Ryton, I must now refer back to the witnesses of that deed, whereby before 1172, Richard de Picheford granted Picheford Mill to Haghmon. Three of those witnesses are Nicholas, Brother of the Grantor, Engelard (whom I suppose to be Engelard de Stretton and Uncle of the Grantor), and Richard Fitz Odo de Ruttune (whom I take to be Engelard's Tenant at Ryton) . I will make these assumptions very plausible. In the year 1165-6, the return of the Tenants in capite of the Kingdom, known as the Liber Niger, was made.7 Engelard de Stratton was one of the King's Vassals of Salopescire, whose Carta or Return is preserved. He gives the King greeting, and his faithful service, recites the Royal Mandate, and in compliance therewith, informs the King that he (Engelard) \" has only one Knight, viz. Richard Fitz Odo, and that he has no Knight of the New Feoffment.\"8 The meaniug of this is that Engelard de Stretton only held one Knight's Fee in capite, that the Feoffment creating it was of date anterior to the death of Henry I (1135), and that the Knight then holding it under Engelard was Richard Fitz Odo. 7 Supra, Vol. I, p- 3. 3 Liber Niger, vol. i, pp- 147, 118. 5 Rot.

At Michaelmas 1173 and 1174, he appears as having acted as Visor over Guy le Strange's repairs of Shrewsbury Castle. At Michaelmas 1177, he had been amerced by the King himself for trespass on the Royal Forests, a circumstance which tallies so nearly with his ceasing to be Castellan of Stretton, that I cannot but associate the two events. His amercement was 10 merks and a Destrier. He paid 5 merks in 1177, and the balance before Michaelmas 1178.9 Presuming him not to have long survived the latter year, I will merely say of his succession that he had a daughter Felicia, but that his eventual heirship was in his Sister Alice and her issue by her husband Philip de Burgo ; that the son of the said Philip and Alice was Bertram de Burgo,10 and that Bertram as well as his Son and perhaps Grandson of the same name, successively in herited a kind of seigneury in Ryton. They had other interests also, both in Staffordshire and Shropshire, and, as regards the latter, these De Burghs usually appear to have been Tenants of the Pich fords, that is of the male descendants of that Ralph who was Father of their maternal Ancestress, Alice. But there was a long interval during which the seigneury of De Burgh at Ryton is unrecorded. The apparent reason of this is that the tenure from being simply by service of a Knight's-Fee came to be commuted for a tenure by service of doing ward at the King's Castle of Shrawardine, and that so, he who held Ryton under De Burgh and performed the latter service was reputed to be and often registered as the actual tenant ... Capite. Of him and his succession we will now speak : \u2014 We have already seen him as Richard Fitz Odo in 1165, and as Richard Fitz Odo of Ruttune before 1172. He or his Son called simply Richard de Ruiton, appears as a witness to various deeds 9 Rot. Pip. 23 and 24 Hen. II, Salop. Burgo.

In October 1203, Richard de Ruton occurs as a Juror in causes of Grand Assize tried at Salop ; he was himself amerced half a merk for some transgression, and was Surety for the fine of a neighbour ing landholder, Henry de Hugford.11 At Michaelmas 1204, when King John's fifth Scutage had been Assessed, as well as upon Tenants by Knight's service as Tenants by Serjeantry, Richard de Ruiton had been charged and had paid half a merk to the same, as if he were a tenant of one-fifth of a Knight's fee.12 In the year 1211, he is entered as one of the King's Tenants by Serjeantry in the County of Salop, his service being to find one serving foot-soldier with a lance, for the ward of the King's Castle of Shrawardine.13 His trust in 1220, has before been noticed.14 At the Assizes of November 1221, he appears both as a Knight and Juror of Grand Assize, but beyond his attestations of some later deeds I can say nothing further of him. His successor seems to have been John de Ruton, who in two lists of Fitz Alan's Shropshire Barony is said, about 1240, to hold half a Knight's fee in Ruton of John Fitz Alan.15 A third and nearly contemporary list omits this entry,10 and indeed Ryton could only be said to be held of Fitz Alan because it owed service to Shrawardine, a Castle of which John Fitz Alan was then seized. This John de Ruton appears on several Juries, and as witness of many local deeds. At the Assizes of January 1256, he was one of the two principal Jurors of Brimstree Hundred whose office was to choose their ten fellows. I do not find him attesting deeds to which I can assign a later date than 1263. His successor, William de Ruton, I find similarly engaged as a Juror and a Witness from about 1270 to 1303. Early in that period, he gave two acres to Wombridge Priory, \u2014 the said two acres lying intermixed with lands in Grindle which 16 Ibidem, p. 44. At the same time Ralph de Pichford is said to hold a Knight's Fee in Albrighton and Ruton in capite (Ibidem, p. 45). This again is-not absolutely correct.

Before the year 1316 his own interests at Ryton had passed, either by purchase or descent, to Roger Carles, who is then entered as Lord.22 This Roger Carles (whom I take to have been Son of Nicholas Carles of Albrighton) had been for some time a prominent person in this neighbourhood, and so continued for at least sixteen year longer. All that I shall further say of him here is, that on Jan. 11, 1318, he obtained the King's Charter of Free Warren in Ryton, Whiston, Bonigale,and Albrighton, in each of which localities he will therefore have had a considerable interest.23 RYTON CHURCH. The parochial district now attached to this Church would seem originally to have been within the Saxon Parish of Idshall.24 The separation probably took place in the twelfth century, and the Founder of the district Church was still more evidently the Lord of the Fee. About the year 1186, the Priests of Ryton, Albrighton, and we can gather from the Abstract is that it was an inquiry as to the tenure of William de Routon and in behalf of the Abbot of Bildwas ; and that it concerned or named the following places, viz. Cos pesford, Hatton, Routon, and Bikedon (Calendar, vol. i, p. 92). 22 Parliamentary Writs, vol. iv, p. 399. The place is printed in this very inaccu rate Record as Ruyx. 23 Charter, 11 Edw.

At the Assizes of September 1272, the Jurors of Brimstree Hundred reported that William de Cheney, whilst Constable of Brug, took away the key of the Rector of Ry ton's grange (.. e. barn), saying that he would have corn for the Castle of Brug, and that this was since the war (1265) and the proclamation of peace, and that said William took half-a-merk from the said Rector for re storation of the key.26 In 1291, the Church of Ryton, in the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, the Archdeaconry of Salop, and Deanery of Newport, was valued at .\u00a32. per annum?7 In 1341, the Assessors of the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, charged only 10*. on this Parish. The reasons for so small an assessment were because the small tithes, offerings, hay-tithe, and glebe, which went to make up the greater taxation (\u00a32.), were not to be reckoned in the ninth, and because the Rector had a carucate of land besides, and several Tenants, and because much land lay unfilled by reason of the poverty and quitting of the occupiers.33 In 1534, Richard Rowley being Rector here, the gross value of his Benefice was ascertained by the King's Commissioners to be \u00a36, on which there was an annual charge of 6*. 8d. for Procurations, and Is. 5d. for Synodals.29 The Advowson of Ryton seems to have been held by the elder branch of the Pichfords rather than by the De Burghs who were representatives of the younger branch. \u2014 There is a similar compli cation of these two interests in nearly every Manor where either was concerned. An Inquest which was held at Albrighton, May 6, 1285, on the death of John de Pichford, found him to have been seized of this Advowson.30 The Lords of Albrighton continued to present to the Church for forty years longer; then the Advowson and the Manor became united in the Carles family, and both descended to Corbett of Longnor.31 28 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 193. 29 Valor Ecclesiaslicus, iii, 187. 30 Inquisitions, 13 Edw.

The first of whom I find mention is Robert de Grenhul, who about the year 1190, attests Walter de Dunstanville's grant of Aynulfs-Lee to Wombridge Priory.36 At the Assizes of October 1203, this Robert de Grenhul sued Hugh de Beckbury for unduly raising a stank in Beckbury whereby \"Robert's freehold in Grenhull was injured, and his meadows inun dated. Damages of 8s. were given, and the stank ordered to be lowered to its previous state. At the same Assizes, Robert de Grenhul essoigned his own attendance at the \"common summons.\" He was succeeded by Richard de Grenhul, who in 1220, was a Recognizor in a great trial about the Advowson of Tong. From this time till about 1250, Richard de Grenhul appears a frequent witness to Charters of Wombridge and Buildwas. At the Assizes of November 1221, Richard de Grenehull was Defendant in a trial of Grand Assize, wherein William Coterel sued him for a half-a-virgate in Herthull.37 Richard gave half-a merk for license to accord, his Surety being Hugh de Beckbury. The fine which resulted is preserved. \u2014 Thereby Richard conceded the premises to William, \u2014 to have and to hold of Richard and his heirs at a rent of 12c.. For this William gave two merks.38 This Richard, calling himself Lord of Grenhull, and for the health of the souls of himself, his Ancestors, and Successors, made a considerable grant to Wombridge Priory. The gift comprises two half-virgates in the vill of Grenhulle with the meadow ap pertaining thereto, also a meadow called Alan's meadow, also a culture bounded \" by the green lane, which goes from Brocton to Ruton and by the rivulet which runs under Hadinton\" (Harrington) . He also allows that the Canons shall have pasturage for 200 sheep, and for the working Cattle of themselves, or their tenants, or assignees occupying said land ; the latter right to extend to the Grantor's meadows or cultures when not under crop. He also grants free transit through his land for their carts and other imple ments, and liberty to get stone in his quarries ; and lastly that the Canons shall be quit of all suit of his Court, and need not attend there unless it be for their own pleasure or profit.39 I cannot determine the situation of the premises in dispute. 3fi Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

At the Assizes of January 1256, this John officiated as a Juror for the Hundred of Brimstree, and he is found continuously as a Juror or Witness in records or deeds down to November 1277. There is a Quit-claim of his in the Wombridge Chartulary, which (being apparently of date October 21, 1270) releases to that house the rent of one halfpenny, due to him on Grindle Mill.43 This was clearly in consequence of a contemporary agreement whereby the Canons had given him a fee-farm grant of the same Mill at an annual rent of one merk, reserving to themselves the usual seignoral rights whenever any of John's heirs or suc cessors should happen to be in minority \u2014 reserving also a power of distress (in case of the said rent being unpaid) to be levied by the Bailiff of the Hundred on all the Tenant's goods.43 Between the years 1277 and 1285, John de Grenhull was succeeded by Ranulph de Grenhull.

A great proportion of the lands which are now associated with the village of Brockton were, in 1085, involved with Sutton, but there was also a small and separate Manor which we find thus noticed in Domesday. \u2014 \" The same Osbern (Eitz Richard) holds Broctone (of the Earl) Bruniht who occurs above (.. e. under Badger) held it (in time of King Edward) .

At all events that \"William de Begesour who, about 1174, sold his interest in Badger, appears to have retained and transmitted to his heirs a subtenancy in Brockton. The name will occur again in the latter relation. As to Osbern Fitz Richard's Seigneury here, that reverted to the Crown within fifty years after Domesday, and probably at the same time and for the same causes as have been suggested under Ryton. The neighbouring Manors of Stockton and Sutton were con temporaneously in the King's hands, whereby it came to pass that, on their redistribution in time of Henry II, the Domesday limits of each were not strictly observed. Hence I must speak with some uncertainty of the specific descent of that virgate and eight acres which are entered in Domesday as \" Broctone.\" This land was possibly represented by a tenement of two virgates, held subsequently under the Crown by petit serjeantry. The im mediate tenants bore the name of Russel, and their service was that of Castle-Guard at Shrawardine.

The next whom I find in the position of Robert Russell was Geoffrey Russell, who attests a deed of Griffin, son of Gervase Goch, in the year 1194. In the fiscal year, ending Michaelmas 1204, King John's fifth Scutage was levied. It was at the rate of two-and-a-half merks (\u00a31. 13s. id.) on each Knight's Fee; but the peculiarity of this Scutage was, that it was assessed, not only on Tenants in capite by Knight's service, but on Tenants by Serjeantry. Thus Geoffrey Russell appears upon the Roll as chargeable with half-a-merk.3 The same Geoffrey is found attesting certain Brockton Deeds in 1205, and between that year and 1211. In June 1211, this Geoffrey was deceased, and William Russell was the King's Tenant at Brockton. From two Rolls of that date his obligation is gathered to be \" the finding of one serving foot soldier with a bow, for ward of the King's Castle of Srawrthin.\"1 About 1225, this William Russell granted to Ralph de Sanford, for his homage and service, and for 20s. then paid, all the land which said William had in Wunedon ; \u2014 rendering therefore 2s. per annum? Some time afterwards Henry Ywein granted to Wombridge Priory an acre of land which he had in Bromcroft in the vill of Brocton.6 A contemporary Charter by William Russel shows that this acre was held under him by Henry Ywein who was in fact his relation.7 He confirmed the grant and added a further donation of his own, viz. three acres on the hill of Habenhull (now The Avenals), and another acre in Bromcroft.8 2 Testa de Nevill, so. 275. 3 Rot.

Thomas Russel underwent sentence of outlawry and forfeiture within twelve years of his succession. An Inquest of Tenures in Brimstree Hundred, which appears to have been taken about 1251, records as follows : \u2014 \"Thomas Russel, who held of the King in capite two virgates of land in Brocton, by service of being in garrison at Montgomery, with whatever arms he chose for self-defence, slew a man, and his land was seized into the King's hand.

It was apparently early in that year that the King ordered an Inquest to be taken by the Sheriff and Coroners as to the circumstance of this Tenure. Of the Jury which sat on this occasion were Ivo de Brocton, Roger Bagh (Baggesore), Thomas de Brocton, Richard le Oyselur, Hugh Pym, William Dunnynger, William Fitz Elyas, &c. They reported that Thomas Russel's land was an Escheat of the King, who could give it to whom he chose, but that Dionisia, Thomas's Mother, was still holding one-third thereof in dower.13 The King seems to have acted immediately on this information. His writ dated at St. Paul's, London, May 18, 1261, runs as follows. \u2014 \" The King having regard to the long services of Nicholas le Waleys his Messenger hath granted to said Nicholas for life that Messuage, &c. in Broghton which Thomas Russel once held in capite 9 Rot.

At his death the premises shall revert to the Crown. The Escheator citra Trent is to put the Grantee in possession without delay.13 At the Assizes of September 1272, the Brimstree Jurors reported the non-attendance of Nicholas le Messager, also that \" he had for ten years withdrawn from the Hundred-Court all suit for his tenure in Brocton, whereby the King was damaged 2s. yearly ; also that the said tenure was a virgate of land in Brockton, for which he was to find for the King one bow (archer) with a bolt (bosone) for fifteen days, at Mungomery, in time of war.\"14 The Feodary of 1284 exhibits the extent of this tenure, and also the service due thereon to the Crown, as again changed ; though I suppose that the Tenant mentioned held under Nicholas le Messager, and not, as stated, in capite. \u2014 Alexander le Cold is entered as holding half a virgate in the vill of Brocton in capite, by service of going with the King into Wales in time of war, with one lance, for a week.15 At the Assizes of October 1292, a thorough investigation of the various rights of the Crown in this County brought this Serjeantry again under notice.16 The King, by Hugh de Louther (his Attorney), prosecuted Nicholas le Messager for one virgate in Brocton, which he, the King, claimed as his right. The Defendant did not appear, and the Sheriff having been ordered to summon him had not done so, but certified that said Nicholas was dead. Hugh de Louther denied this, and affirmed Nicholas to be alive and well (in plena, vita), and was ready to prove this by Jury. The Sheriff made a similar appeal ; so an Inquest was ordered thereupon, and a formal precept issued to the Coroners.

I believe that it was afterwards held by the Burnels of Langley, in common with other acquisitions in the neighbourhood which had been secured by their relative, the princely Bishop of Bath and Wells, who died, holding the Great Seal of England, at the very time when these Prosecutions were on foot. We should say something of the descent of that Iweyn whom we have seen to become a Feoffee of Robert Russell in the twelfth cen tury, and whose heirs were consequently under-tenants of the successive occupants of this Serjeantry. Henry Fitz Ywein is found attesting local deeds early in the thirteenth century. As Henry Ywein he has already been mentioned at a somewrhat later date. Robert Ouewyn served on a Stockton Inquest in 1243. Richard Iwen, Iweyn, or Weyn, of Brockton, occurs as a witness before 1249, as a Juror in 1253, and was living in 1272. From the latter date till the beginning of the next century another Henry Iweyn seems to have represented the family ; and in 1316, 1318, and 1336 we have Richard Owyn, Heweyn, or Vweyn in a similar position. On May 1, 1341, Sibil, widow of Richard Owyn, occurs as holding dower in Brockton.17 LINLEY FEE IN BROCKTON. I have already hinted that of several tenures in Brockton it is difficult to distinguish the one which constituted the Domesday Manor from others which, having been involved at Domesday, in Sutton, were afterwards detached therefrom and became inde pendent. A second tenure (of two and a half virgates) shall have notice here, as possibly representing the Domesday Manor of Broctone. This, in time of King Henry II, was held in capite by Richard de Linley. Of him I have spoken under Linley, and shall here say no more of him than that he appears to have alienated one-and-a-half virgates of his Serjeantry in Brocton to Sibil de Linley,18 his rela- very studious of a consistent orthography ; but the spelling of Welsh proper names seems to have been a subject of more than usual caprice. 17 Wombridge Chartulary paa s im, and Charters at Haughton.

Sibil in turn bestowed her land in Brocton on Lilleshall Abbey, as has been before stated.19 We will presently return to the Lilleshall interest thus created here ; but now we will follow the descent of those two Coheiresses who eventually succeeded Philip de Linley in the residuary virgate at Brockton, as well as in the whole Manor of Linley. These were the wives, one of William le Forcer, the other (Isolda) of Wido de Farlow.30 An Inquest of Tenures in Brimstree Hundred taken in 1227. states that William (it should be Wido) de Fernlawe and William le Forcir hold a virgate in Brockton by service of finding one serving foot-soldier at Shewrthin (Shrawardine) for eight days if necessary; and that the annual value (of the said virgate) was 15_\\31 Guy de Fernlawe was Lord of Farlow, and has already occurred to our notice as attesting a Broseley deed about 1230, and a Pickthorn Deed about 1241-2. 33 And soon after that he died, leaving Philip his son and heir, who before the year 1251, calling himself Philip, son of Wido de Farnlowe, grants to Stephen, son of William Keede (elsewhere spelt Cude) of Brockton, for his homage and for 20s. entrance-fee, half a virgate in Brockton which came hereditarily to him (Philip) from Ysonda his mother : \u2014 to hold in fee at a rent of 7.9. 6c..23 is inaccurate and ungrammatical ; but its intended meaning is clearly that which I have assigned to it. in Brockton rather than Bramton or Drayton will be clear ; but who William Briwere the Tenant was I cannot sur mise. He may have been Guardian of the two Coheiresses, or he may have been the first husband of one of them, or again he may have been the heir of Philip de Linley and Father of them both. 19 Supra, Yol.

Judgment was given for the Defendant because the Plaintiff had never been in seizin of tbe premises (Abbrev. Placitorum, p. 103). A confusion of the names Drayton and Brockton is not a singular occurrence. 1. William Briware holds by serjeantry one virgate in Drayton, and he should find one serving foot-soldier for ward of the Castle of the Lord King of Srawthin (Testa de Nevill, p. 55). 2. William Bruere holds by serjeantry of one serving foot-soldier with a bow, for ward of Sraworthin (Liber Rub. Scacc. so. cxxxvii). 3.

This rent of 7s. 6d. and the Seigneural rights which it implied were afterwards bought up by Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was at the time a ready purchaser of any Shrop shire property. On May 5, 1280, the following Fine was levied at Westminster between said Robert, Complainant (querentem), and Matilda de Farlawe, Defendant (impedientem) , of 4s. rent in Brockton whereof was plea. \u2014 \" Matilda acknowledged the right of Robert thereto as of her own gift.

This William, who has occurred as witness of two Broseley deeds about 1230, was deceased before Dec. 6, 1242, when Henry his Son and Heir fined three merks with the King, to have seizin of his Father's lands, although he (Henry) was yet under age. The King accepted his fealty, and he was to do his homage on the King's return into England. The Sheriff of Salop was to take security for the said three merks, and give Henry full seizin.35 No. xv.

A fine of 20s., for which Andrew de Wileley and John Tece of Tasley were his Sureties, seems then to have procured his release. His attestation of two Charters as a Tenant of Shrewsbury Abbey at Astley must have passed between^ this period and his death (Oct. 6, 1272). 29 The first Inquest as to his estate reported him to \"have held half-a-virgate of the vill of Brocthon, which a certain free man (his Feoffee of 1248) then held, by doing service for him (Henry) at Suarthin, also that the said Henry had sold all his right therein to Robert Burnell.\" A second Inquest, which sat April 16, 1273, purports to be more correct.

Margery de Harcourt, daughter and (as she is on this occasion less accurately called) Coheir of William de Harcourt, claimed this wardship, and petitioned the Crown for the same in 1275. Her claim arose as having the Seigneury of Ayleston (co. Leicester) . She alleged that her ancestors always had custody and marriage of the Heirs of Le Forcer, who were Tenants of that Manor, notwith standing that Henry Le Forcer had held other lands of the Honour of Montgomery and the Priory of Wenlock (she alluded to Brockton and Linley). The King's writ, dated 18 July 1275, directed the Sheriff of Shropshire to inquire into this matter. A Jury met at Brockton on January 2, 1276, and reported that Richard de Harcourt, Margery's Grandfather, had had the marriage of Henry le Forcer, deceased, the latter having been a Minor at the death of his Father William ; that said Richard sold the said marriage to Nicholas le Forcer, Henry's Uncle; and that the King and his Ancestors, Lords of the Honour of Montgomery, had never had marriage or custody of the Forcers.31 Sir Robert Burnell, above mentioned as purchasing Henry le Forcer's interest at Brockton, was consecrated Bishop of Bath and Wells April 7, 1275. We have already seen how in 1280 he was buying the seigneury (or right to the chief-rent) of the other moiety of this Serjeantry. His object was a title to the whole rent of 15s. per annum (7s. 6d. being the reserved rent on each moiety) ; and it should be remembered that 15s. had been stated in 1227 to be the value of this virgate to its owners. The Bishop seems either to have changed the Under-Tenants here, or to have performed the services due on this Serjeantry by another deputy ; but his transactions at this period were so numerous and complicated that I cannot do more than set down what I suppose to relate to Brockton. The Bishop had a relation, a Nephew I believe, Richard Burnell, to whom he granted Langley, at first for life, and afterwards in fee.\u2014 In 1284, Richard Burnel is entered as holding one virgate in 31 Inquitiliont, 4 Edw.

The said exchange was attested by the Bishop himself,33 who seems, as regards this estate, to have anticipated the succession of his heir. Nevertheless, Richard Burnel continued to hold this land, and to be reputed the Tenant in capite, though the service due thereon appears again to have been changed. \u2014 In 1310, when the army of England was under summons to meet at Tweedmouth on Sept. 19th, Richard Burnel proffered service of a fourth part of a Knight's Fee to be performed by one serving man with a barded horse.34 Richard Burnel of Langley seems to have died in 1313,35 and to have been succeeded both at Langley and Brockton by William Burnel. In 1328, when marriage articles were agreed upon between Edward (son of this William) and Margaret Lee, William Burnel enfeoffed the said Edward, &c. \" in all his lands in Broc tone near Kembrygton, except the Tenement which he held of the King in capite, and which he might not alienate without license.\"36 The virgate-and-half which Richard de Linley had given to Sibil de Linley out of this Serjeantry was before 1199 granted by the latter to Lilleshall Abbey. It would seem that one Agnes de Brocton had some claim to a rent receivable from the Abbey on this or other land in Brockton. A deed wherein she calls herself daughter of William makes over her right, whatever it was, to Ralph de Sanford,37 who was at this period (1210-1224) purchasing largely in the neighbourhood. 32 Kirby's Quest.

Among the followers and countrymen of the Norman Lord one Gerard de Tornai received a share of the spoil. He held at Domesday, and for at least a season afterwards, eighteen Manors, of which Sutton was the largest and most valuable. I can say little more of Gerard de Tornai's career in Shropshire than that it ter minated in a total and absolute forfeiture, and, whereas such forfeiture must have been very nearly contemporary with the great western Rebellion of 1088, 1 do not see that we can help associating the two events.3 The disinherited Baron had one, or more than one daughter. She (if only one) was Sibil the wife of Hamo Peverel, whose influence in Shropshire, already great in time of Earl Hugh (1093-1098), will have originated in this marriage, and in the accompanying favour of that seigneural Lord, whether King or Earl, who dictated the re-disposal of Gerard's forfeited estates. The bare mention of this name of Peverel will suggest a throng of recollections to every one acquainted with the vicissitudes which befel this County during the first Century after the Norman Conquest. National Records, Monastic Chartularies, Chronicles and Legends, all speak of the Peverels ; but the pervading feature of every account or hint is, that something is kept back which either was not known or was not to be talked of. The only specific statement yet advancea, attributes the various branches of this house to a Saxon Ancestress, who, as we are told, was first the Concubine of Duke William of Normandy, and then the wife of Ranulph Peverel of Hatfield (Essex), and who, after being Mother (by the Duke) of William Peverel of Nottingham,' subsequently gave lawful birth to all the other Peverels who figured in the time of Henry I.3 This story, improbable in its simplest form,4 and with the fewest 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 296. ter of Duke William. Moreover, this alleged liaison with a Saxon Lady of rank can have originated in no earlier circum stance than the event of the Duke's visit to the Court of Edward the Confessor in 1051. However, William Peverel of Not tingham, whatever his parentage, must have been born before that period, for he was old enough in 1068 to be entrusted with one of the most responsible offices in the kingdom, the custody of the Castle and Province from which he took his name. 3 This account is adopted by Dugdale, and appears to have been originally vouched by Robert Glover, some-time Somerset Herald. Glover's reputation as a Herald is I believe still high, aud in dependently of that it may seem pre sumptuous to question an authority which Dugdale accepted. Nevertheless I cannot help doing so. 4 Its imj-robability arises in two ways.

Mystery there certainly is about the whole subject, and the truth may very possibly be buried with some tale of courtly scandal, though not of the precise character hitherto pointed out. Leaving a curious, but perhaps hopeless investigation, we should here say that Domesday appears to make mention of .only two Peverels, viz. William (of Nottingham) and Ranulph (of Essex), and that the latter had a small territory in Shropshire held under the Norman Earl. This accident is, I believe, the fact which has mainly induced some Genealogists to conclude that Ranulf was Father of those Shrop shire Peverels who attended the Court and enjoyed the favours of King Henry I. Such a conclusion wants all substantial foundation, and is directly subverted by one chief consideration, viz. that of the many Lordships enjoyed by Ranulf Peverel in four Domesday Counties (Shropshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex), not one can be proved to have descended to those other Peverels of whom I am now to speak.6 The latter family consisted of several brothers or half-brothers, whose parentage is unknown, and whose very number is uncertain. If they were four, their names were Hamo, William, Pagan, and Robert, if they were only three, then Pagan and Robert constitute a single person described in different documents by different names.6 ' 5 Their estates lay in Shropshire, Not tinghamshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Huntingdonshire, Cambridge shire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire, and they all came into court-favour before the death of Ranulph Peverel whose only son and suc cessor seems to have been that William Peverel who was afterwards called of Essex or of London, to distinguish him from his Contemporaries William of Nottingham and William of Brun, or of Dover. Founder of Barn well Priory, and the Chartulary of that House printed in the Monasticon (vol. vi, p. 86) contains a document of very general truthfulness and which professes to give account of his descendants. It makes him Father of that Wdliam Peverel who died in Pales tine, and of the four Coheiresses presently to be mentioned in the text. That he was succeeded in Cambridge shire by the said William Peverel and then by the said Sisters, there can be no question ; and the only doubt as to the Barnwell Chronicler's accuracy arises from his giving a date for Pagan Peverel's death at least ten years too early. So much for Pagan Peverel as Father of William. 6 I shall have hereafter to recur to this subject of the Peverels. I should perhaps however state here how this doubt about Pagan and Robert arises. \u2014 Pagan Peverel had a great Fief in Cam bridgeshire by grant of Henry I. He was In a charter of Thorney Abbey (priuted"], [606, "106 SUTTON MADDOCK. Hamo Peverel, as I have already said, acquired a great position in Shropshire before the death of Earl Hugh de Montgomery, and therefore during the reign of William Rufus. His two Bro thers, William aud Pagan, do not occur to our notice till after the accession of Henry I. Hamo Peverel, with whom alone we are now concerned, acquired his succession to Gerard de Tornai under a title obviously ambi guous from the very first. He married the heiress or co-heiress of an escheated Barony, but such a marriage could have brought nothing to Hamo Peverel except by special favour of the Suzerain or Suzerains under whom Gerard de Tornai had held. Hence arose, as I conceive, two distinct and afterwards conflicting principles as to this succession. Hamo Peverel, and his wife Sibil, spoke of and treated this Fief as their inheritance, but yet transmitted it in such a mode as is quite irreconcilable with any known principle of hereditary descent. With similar inconsistency Henry II once addressed the heirs of Hamo Peverel as if they were also heirs of Gerard de Tornai, and yet on all other occasions seems to have ignored and gradually to have abolished any such pretensions. He in short controlled the Fief of Gerard de Tornai as a simple escheat and as subject to every recurrent interference of himself as the immediate Seigneur. But to return to our proper subject, \u2014 Hamo Peverel, first con spicuous in the Palatine Court of Earl Hugh de Montgomery, and afterwards enjoying the favour of King Henry I, undoubtedly held Sutton during the whole of that Monarch's reign. After Henry I's death and during the short interval of his own survivorship Hamo Peverel made to Salop Abbey that grant of the \" fishery and passage of Sutton\" which has already been alluded to.7 In the year 1138, Hamo Peverel was dead, and two youths whom he had apparently destined as his heirs, while living, occur to our notice, partly as dealing jointly with his and Gerard de Tornai's estates, but more prominently as linked together in the cause of the daughter of Henry I.8 in the Monasticon vol. ii, 601, viii) this identical William Peverel (the Cru sader) mentions his Father's Christian name as having been Robert. 8 It is hardly possible to reconcile the anomalies which are again presented at this stage of the history of the Peverels. Though Hamo Peverel appointed William Peverel the younger and Walcheline Ma minoht his heirs, we have not a hint as to his relationship with tho latter. More over Hamo Peverel had a daughter, and Dugdale has adopted both statements in ditferent parts of his Baronage without adverting to their apparent inconsistency. 7 Supra, Vol. 1, p. 44."], [607, "107 SUTTON MADDOCK. The conduct of William Peverel of Dover and Walcheline Maminoht during the usurpation of Stephen associates their names with a great national struggle, rather than with their territorial interests in Shropshire. The former perished in the Crusade of 1147, leaving four sisters his Co-heirs. On the Accession of Henry II, Walcheline Maminoht was sur viving, but neither he nor the four Sisters of William Peverel succeeded in establishing any joint and general claim on the fief of Gerard de Tornai. With Sutton in particular they had no further concern, and we have henceforth to treat of this Manor in a new and changed relation. My supposition is, that during the reign of Henry I, and while the Peverels were actively serving that Monarch in Shropshire and the Marches, a policy was first adopted which had for its object the disintegration of the national unity of North Wales. English lands and English marriages were bestowed on any native Chief who might be open to such bribes and worth the bribing. Thus, I conceive, that is either by affinity or interest, was Jorwerth Goch (the \" Red Edward \" of Border traditions) first associated with the English cause and with the Peverels, for I can look upon his claims on the Fief of Gerard de Tornai only as having originated while Hamo Peverel was seized of that Honour. I understand him to have been a younger Son of Meredyth ap Blethyn ap Convyn, the last Prince who held the Kingdom of Old that daughter did not die issueless. So far from this daughter (Seburga) having been Hamo Peverel's heir, she and her descendants were only Tenants of his col lateral heir9, and so far from the same Seburga being heir of Sibil de Tornai, that which she and her descendants thus held was no part of Tornai's Fief. Seburga therefore was not Hamo Peverel's daugh ter by his wife Sibil nor by any other wife. She must in short have been ille gitimate. of Gerard de Tornai. Such a supposition appears at first to offer an elucidation, but still we find this William and Hamo dying without lawful issue themselves and trans mitting estates not to any alleged heirs of their respective wives but to their own collateral heirs. If such disposal were by permission or under direction of the Crown we may indeed thus account for the here ditary principle having been afterwards set aside by the same authority. Thus by a series of hypotheses we esta blish something of a consistent theory, but I have little faith in theories thus established. I have often found a single guess in similar subject-matter to prove erroneous. I have here hazarded two or three. My hope is that this statement of uncertainties may bring to light some document available for a future and neces sary recurrence of the question. As to Walcheline Maminoht he would appear to have been more nearly related to Wilham Peverel of Dover, the elder, than to Hamo, \u2014 a thing very possible if, as I believe, the two latter were not Brothers of the whole blood.

On Mercdyth's death, 1133, Madoc and Gruffyth, his two elder sons, became respectively Princes of Lower and Higher Powis. Jorwerth, his younger Son, had Mochnant is Rayader, but rather as a dependency of his Brother Madoc's Fief than as a distinct Principality. Madoc was a firm ally of King Henry II, who had not been three years on the throne when Gerverd Coch (as he is written on the Pipe-Roll) appears to have made aud sustained a legal claim to a great part of the escheated Honour of Gerard de Tornai. \u2014 William Fitz Alan, then Sheriff of Shropshire, rendered account at Michaelmas 1157, of a sum of \u00a37. 6s. id., being the current years ferm of the land of Gerard de Tornai. Of this sum he had paid .\u20ac3. 6s. into the King's Treasury ; the balance \u00a3i. Os. 3d. he had handed over to Gerverd Coch by (order or award of) the Chan cellor and the Earl of Leicester. At the same time he charges \u00a32. 7s. for livery of the King's Archers in the Army, and by order of the King had made presents of \u00a38. 10s. to Maddoch and _\u00a32. to Gervase (Gervetto) . These entries on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll will become very in telligible when collated with contemporary Chronicles. \u2014 I assume that the order by the Chancellor (Becket) and the Earl of Leicester (then Chief Justice of England) implies a previous judicial decision, for had the gift to Gervase Goch been merely one of Grace it would have been authorised by writ of the King him- self. However, it is probable that the claims of Gervase on Gerard de Tornai's Fief were acknowledged not simply on account of their justice but from ulterior political motives. It was in the summer of the year 1157, that Henry II undertook his first expedition against North Wales. Madoc, Priuce of Powis, commanded the fleet which was destined to co-operate with the King's Army along the Northern coast of the Country, and the Welsh Chronicler tells us incidentally that in this same year \" Jorwerth Goch ap Meredith jfcot _he Castle of Yale and burnt it.\" 9 We may hence infer the \u00abBauses which placed Madoc and Gervase (his Brother) on the Shrop 'shire Pipe Roll. 0 Powell, sub anno. Yale was part of the territory of Madoc, Henry's Ally; but the Castle here alluded to was, as we happen to know by accident, built by Owen Gwyn.th in 1149 ; and Owen Gwyneth, Prince of North Wales, being I suppose still in possession was, in 1157, the object of the King's hostility. This undesigned agreement of scattered facts does much to establish the veracity of the Welsh Chronicler from whom Dr. Powell took his statements."], [609, "109 __^ SUTTON MADDOCK. The lands which Gervase Goch acquired in Tornai's Fief seem to have been in Sutton, Brockton, and Ellardine. What he had in Sutton was however not quite identical with the Domesday Manor, a circumstance which has already been accounted for. He further received the Manor of Rowton (near High Ercall) from Henry II, which had not been Gerard de Tornai's at Domesday, though pos sibly Hamo Peverel had since held it. These lands became of course a Tenure in capite, and the service by which the Tenant was to hold them is not the least remarkable among the Scrjeantries of that period. \" The Lord of Sutton, &c. was to be the King's Interpreter (Latimarius) between England and Wales.\" 10 The further history of Gervase Goch and his suc cessors will afford some curious indications of their performing this and cognate services. In 1160, the Sheriff of Shropshire charges his account with several items of expense which he had incurred in the fortification of Border Castles and in subsidizing the native Chieftains of Wales. Amongst others he had paid to \" Gerverd Cok \" a sum of 10s. King Henry's Welsh campaign of 1165 was a failure, which the pressure of his affairs elsewhere allowed him no personal opportunity of retrieving. The conquest of Wales, though a favorite project, might, as he deemed, be accomplished by trusty agents and a specific policy. This policy, at times actively and openly aggressive, was much more uniformly characterized by its elements of watchful intrigue or lavish bribery. In the Autumn of 1166, the King being then in Normandy, two of his most able Lieutenants, Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, and Richard de Luci, were at Chester. Their object was hostile to Wales, but nothing more definite has transpired than that the Earl was seized with sudden sickness and died. In that same year two Welsh Princes had united in an attack on one who was their fellow-countryman and relation, but whose connection with the English King was the probable cause of their animosity. \"Jorwerth Goch,\" says the Chronicler, was \" spoiled of his lands in Powys, by Owen Cyvelioc, the son of Gruffyth ap Meredyth, Lord of Powys, and by Owen Vachan, second the word Romance to any imaginary tale, is a result of the poetical narratives or Minstrelsy of a former age having chanced to be embodied in a base Latin Dialect called the Lingua Romana.

Then it came to signify one who had acquired a knowledge of any other than his native language. So the modern application of 15 II."], [610, "110 SUTTON MADDOCK. sonne to Madoc ap Meredyth : which lands they divided betwixt them, so that Owen Cyvelioc had Mochnant above Rayader, and Owen Vachan Mochnant beneath Rayader.\"11 The accompanying genealogy will show the relationship of these parties. The two Princes were Gervase's Nephews, sons of his elder Brethren, the Coparcners of Powis-land. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of this year supplies a further item of the King's dealings with his Latimarius. Earl Geoffrey and Richard de Lucy had ordered the Sheriff to purchase for the King's use fifteen horses from the stud of Gerverd Chok. The cost (\u00a314. 16s. 8d.) had been paid to the said Gervase, and the horses had been sent, I suppose over sea, to the King ; for Roger Mussun (of whom we shall hear again) had received 20s. for taking them somewhither. At Michaelmas 1167, Gervase's Manor of Sutton (Sutton Ger verdi Cok) had been amerced one merk by the Justiciar of the Forest, but before the following Michaelmas the King, still beyond sea, had transmitted his Writ, ordering the debt to be cancelled in favour of Gervase himself. At the latter period (Michaelmas 1168), William de Beau champ, Sheriff of Worcestershire, obeying an order of Richard de Lucy, had delivered forty horse-loads of corn to \" Yerverd Coch,\" wherewith to victual the Castle of Chirk. At this precise period Gervase Goch was taken still more openly and completely into the King of England's service. In respect of his past sacrifices, or in prospect of his future usefulness, the enormous salary of \u00a391. per annum was appointed for his main tenance ; 13 and this he regularly received for the years ending Michaelmas 1169 and Michaelmas 1170, and for forty-seven weeks of the year ending Michaelmas 1171. The cause of his salary being discontinued does not appear, but at this period a pacification was effected between the King of England and Rese Prince of South Wales ; \u2014 and three years later 11 Powell, p. 163, sub anno 1166.

Possibly however, the death of Gervase Goch rather than the cessation of his diplomatic functions, was the cause of his disappear ance at this crisis. I hear nothing further of him, and find little more than the name of his eldest son and successor at Sutton. \u2014 About the year 1 186-7, this Madoc, calling himself son of Gervase Ghoc, granted to Wombridge Priory the Advowson of his Church of Sutton as far it belonged to him.13 He willed also that his body, wherever he might chance to die, might be buried at that Monastery ; and he promised an annual payment of 2s. during his life in main tenance of the Fraternity of Saint Leonard, his Patron.14 In 1187, this County was visited by the Justices of the Forest. Among amercements imposed by them, one of two merks for some default is entered against Madoch, son of Jetun de Sutton ; and this debt, though it remained on the Rolls of eight consecutive years, does not appear to have been ever liquidated.15 Before the year 1194, Madoc, son of Gervase Goch, will have deceased without issue, leaving his Brother Griffith his heir.

Soon after the return of King Richard from captivity (March 1194), Griffin, son of Jereverth, appears on the Pipe-Roll as fining for his lands, \u2014 in succession, as I presume, to his Brother. The sum of 40 merks was thus paid by him in 1195 and 1196. In the former year died Ralph le Strange, Baron of Knockyn, Alveley, and Weston, in the prime of his life, and leaving a fair inheritance to be divided amongst three Sisters, his Coheirs. One of these, Matilda, became before Michaelmas 1196, the wife of Griffin de Sutton, who then appears, with the husbands of the other Coheiresses, as fining 200 merks for seizin of the said lands.17 A fine of this amount indicates a succession to no mean estate, and Griffin de Sutton's influence in Shropshire was proportionably extended. Some litigation, in which the Coparcners of Ralph le Strange's Barony came to be involved, shall be reserved till we reach the localities concerned. Here we should briefly mention that the three Coheiresses concurred with their husbands in sur rendering Knockyn to their Cousin, John le Strange of Nesse and Cheswardine, who claimed it as his right.

The suit then pending had nothing to do with Sutton, but the reason of his non-appearance is curiously illus trative of the tenure by which he held that Manor.

Griffin de Sutton was rateable to Aids and Scut ages in respect of his wife's inheritance, his own tenure by Serjeantry not being ordinarily liable to those imposts. It may be doubted however whether, for some of the Scutages of King John, he was not assessed on both accounts. On the fourth Scutage, for instance, which was levied in the year 1203, at the rate of 2 merks on each Knight's-Fee, Griffin, son of Yerverd, is charged \u00a35. (7\u00a3 merks) on his Serjeantry. In the year 1204, King John's fifth Scutage was assessed at the rate of 2\\ merks. Here again Griffin de Sutton was chaged \u00a35. in respect of a Knight's Fee, whilst his share of Le Strange's inheritance can at no time have exceeded half-a-fee. In 1205, Griffin Goch fined, or made composition in respect of King John's sixth Scutage; and in 1206, when the seventh Scutage was levied at the rate of \u00a31. (1\\ merks) per Fee, Griffin Goch paid 4 merks thereon.20 I do not find him or his Son assessed to more than one subsequent Scutage, in respect of their tenure at Sutton. A return of the year 1211 gives the first formal statement as to Griffin de Sutton's Serjeantry. He holds, says the Record, Ruelton (Rowton), Ellewr'thin (Ellerdine), Sutton, and Brocton, of the gift of King Henry II, by Service of being Latimarius between England and Wales.21 On January 24, 1221, the King certifies the Sheriff of Salop that Mad doc, son and heir of Griffin de Suttun, deceased, has done homage and fealty. The Sheriff is to take security from said Maddoc for 100*., his relief for one Knight's Fee which he holds in capite in Suttun, and give him full and immediate seizin thereof.23 Griffin de Sutton, thus dying, left his widow Matilda surviving, and other issue besides Madoc. His sons Griffin and Hoel are however the only ones of his younger children whom we need mention here. Something should be said of the successive grants of Griffin de Sutton to Wombridge Priory. His confirmation of 1194 has already been cited. Within ten years of that time, calling himself Griffin, son of Jareford Goch, he grants to the same Canons, for the 30 Rot.

He also gives 12c.. rent (chargeable on the land of Robert Cocus in Brocton) in exchange for that assart on the hill of Severn which had been Thomas Pistor' s, and from which the Canons were already in receipt of a rent of twenty four cocks and hens.26 Another deed of this Griffin shall be cited when I come to speak of the many Feoffments or alienations which he made in his tenure. His Widow, Matilda le Strange, survived him twenty-two years. At the Assizes of November 1221, the Jurors of Brim stree Hundred reported her to be in the King's gift and not as yet bestowed in mar riage.

I do not find any account of her second marriage. She died shortly before May 4, 1242, when the King received the homage of Maddok de Sutton, son and heir of Matilda le Strange, for all lands which she had held in capite in Alvithele and Weston. The relief payable by Maddok was to be three merks.28 Some previous circumstances in the life of this Madoc require notice. It was from him I imagine, rather than his Uncle, that this Manor of Sutton acquired its distinctive name of Sutton Maddock. He was possessed of it more than forty years, and if his importance may be measured by the frequent mention of his name he was a chief among the Knightly personages who constituted the Court of the County. Soon after his succession, Madoc, son of Griffin, and Ducehis wife are found suing Imbert,Prior of Wenlock, for disseizing them of their free tenement in Dallyle (probably Dawley) . The case was heard by the King himself when, in August 1226, he visited Shrewsbury. The Prior was found to have disseized the Plaintiffs of a quarter-of an-acre of moor-land.29 \u2014 The litigation did not end here. In Michaelmas Term 1228, the Prior of Wenlock was prosecuting a suit at Westminster against Maddoch, son of Griffin, and Cecilia his wife, Tenants of 12 acres of wood in Sutton and 6 acres of land in Daghele. But the King had issued mandate to his Justices in banco, that the case should be postponed till Madoc should be released from prison, he having been arrested by Lewellyn, Prince of North Wales.30 This suit was still on foot in Easter Term 1229, when Cecilia names her husband (now I suppose at large) as her Attorney therein, re moving at the same time Wymanus de Karleton her former Attorney.31 I find not how it ended, but it has already supplied us 37 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

In Michaelmas Term 1242, Madoc de Sutton appears with twenty two others as impleaded in the Courts at Westminster by John de la Lawe for robbery and breach of the King's Peace. The Defendants had repeatedly failed to appear, so the Sheriff was ordered to have them bodily in Court on the Octaves of St. Martin.32 On that clay (Nov. 18), the Sheriff had done nothing. He was ordered to distrain them to appear in Hilary Term following.33 Ere that time the matter was compounded, and Madok de Sutton acknowledged, in Court, that he owed 10 merks to John de la Lawe \" for a fine in a certain appeal.\" 3~t At Michaelmas 1247, Madoc de Sutton had been amerced one merk for some default.35 This perhaps arose thus, \u2014 In 1248, certain persons, who had been assessable to the auxilium levied in 1235 and 1236 for the marriage of Isabella the King's Sister, and had escaped payment, appear to have been put in charge as Defaulters. Among them Madoc de Sutton pays 2 merks, the sum chargeable on a Knight's Fee.36 In 1250, when Geoffrey de Langley assessed various persons in this County for lands which they had assarted without license, Madoc de Sutton was put in charge for some land thus reclaimed in Sutton.37 Madoc de Sutton was returned in 1253-4, as one of eleven per sons in the Counties of Salop and Stafford, who being of less than Baronial degree were yet possessed of lands to the extent of \u00a320. annual value.38 In ] 256, Madoc de Sutton formed the design of alienating his interest at Sutton and Brockton to Wombridge Priory.

The Crown however interfered, threaten ing forfeiture of the whole if Madoc did more than grant a lease thereof to the Priory for a term of three years.39 This alternative seems to have been adopted, for on August 7, the King being at Worcester, ratifies by Letters Patent the Concession which Madoc had made of the Manor of Sutton with the rents and escheats of Brocton and Hedinton (Harrington), \u2014 to hold to the Prior and Convent of Wombrig for three years.40 I doubt not that at the expiration of this term,' Madoc was repossessed of the Manor, for I not only find Sir Madoc de Sutton standing as first witness to a charter of Wombridge which passed about Easter 1261,41 but in February 1262, he appears on a list of the Regarders of the Forests of Wombridge, Mount Gilbert, and Haughmond. Moreover he eventually succeeded in alienat ing this Manor as well as Rowton and Ellardine to John le Strange, third Baron of Nesse and Cheswardine, who died early in 1269. This sale, as I suppose it to have been, was clearly with sanc tion of the Crown, but the tenure by which Sutton was held was altered. The Lord thereof was no longer the King's Latimarius, though at first his office was of a cognate kind. Of this however presently, for we have not yet done with Sir Madoc de Sutton. He seems to have left nothing of his possessions in East Shrop shire to his heirs or to his issue, if we except his share of Alveley, which he gave in frank marriage to his daughter Isabel, wife of Henry de Mors. His end is a mystery. At the time when he sold Sutton he must have been an old man, and it was a period when the conflicts between the English and Welsh were incessant. \u2014 Something more definite may perhaps be found regarding him and his succession when we come to investigate the historv of the Border. I will enumerate here some charters which passed in his name whilst Lord of Sutton. \u2014 As Madoc son of Griffin de Sutton he enfeoffs Radulph de San ford in an acre of land in the fields of Brocton, viz. that which Henry le Strange held in the Hemme.

I find it positively stated with regard to Ellardine and Rowton, that John le Strange enfeoffed his eldest son and heir therein, and that the latter granted both to Robert his younger Brother.52 Something of the same kind evidently happened in regard to Sutton, for at the Assizes of September 1272, the Brimstree Jurors, reporting the Serjeantries in their Hundred, certify that \" Robert le Strange holds the Manor of Sutton by serjeantry of conducting the King in Wales in time of war.\"63 This Robert le Strange, as I have already said under Willey, was one of the Crusaders then absent from England. Though he lived to return, it would appear that before his departure he had taken the precaution of granting Sutton to Fulk the second of his then infant Sons. Upon Robert le Strange's death (about August 1276), Sir Bogo de Knovile, then Sheriff of Shropshire, seized Sutton into the King's hand. This step, the result of Fulk le Strange's minority, was called in question, and an Inquest was ordered to ascertain and report all particulars to the King. The Jurors, headed by the Sheriff and the King's Escheator, sat at Shrewsbury on September 25, 1276.

We know how this investigation resulted. \u2014 Fulk le Strange con tinued a ward of the Crown, and Sutton an Escheat till 1289, for at the Assizes of 1292, the Jurors of Brimstree Hundred reported as follows. \u2014 \" Fulco le Strange holds Sutton, which is worth \u00a310, by Serjeantry, viz. by finding four foot-soldiers to the ward of Montgomery for fifteen days at his own cost, and he owes suit to the Hundred every three weeks.\" And Fulk (being summoned into Court to give account of his due discharge of these services) came forward and said that the Manor had been in the King's cus tody till three years since, when the King restored it to him, and that he did the said suit (which the Sheriff certified), and acknow ledged the said (obligation to do) ward.55 About the time, when this Fulk le Strange obtained livery of Sutton by reason of his majority, he also became the heir of his elder Brother, John le Strange of Whitchurch, who, dying without issue at the early age of twenty-three, left a considerable inheritance to this his Successor. Thus, and by formal writ of Parliamentary Summons, did Fulk le Strange become first Baron of the House of Blackmere, the originator of that noble succession, which, after twice merging in lines greater than itself, is now no longer repre sented by a Talbot or a Howard, but is in abeyance between the heirs-general of those illustrious races.56 We have now only to notice the sequel of Fulk le Strange's con nexion with Sutton. About the year 1291, calling himself Lord of Sutton Madoc, he confirmed to Wombridge Priory all its acquisitions in that Manor, particularly some, which the Canons appear to have recently made under grants of John de Brocton, Clerk, and Roger, son of Nicholas 55 Placita Corona, 20 Edw.

He also grants them common- pasturage throughout the Manor, except for goats.57 About the same time Fulk le Strange came to an agreement with the Canons, whereby the latter surrendered Madoc de Sutton's grant of Hadinton (that is Sutton) Mill, in exchange for a messuage, garden, croft, half-a-virgate of land, and other small parcels within and without the vill of Brocton.57 About June 11, 1300, he further releases to the Canons all his right in land which they held in the Moor of Brocton, in the field of Habenhul, on the day mentioned.58 On March 11, 1308, styling himself Fulco le Strange, Lord of Sutton Madoks, he grants to Richard de Sanford a parcel of his waste land in Brocton, in his Manor of Sutton, lying between lands of said Richard and of the Prior of Wombridge.

The principal of these were granted by Griffin Goch while Lord of Sutton (1194-1221) ; but his Feoffment of Ralph de Sanford claims first attention, not only by reason of its extent and the importance of the Feoffee, but because it can be illustrated by an unusual and most interesting concurrence of evidences. SANFORD FEE IN SUTTON AND BROCKTON. At Salop Assizes, Oct. 6, 1203, a Fine seems to have been levied between Griffin son of Yor ward (Gervase) Plaintiff, and Ralph Wolaston, Tenant, of one hide of land in Brockton, whereof was suit at law.63 The particulars of the Fine, I cannot declare, but think from what will presently appear, that it must have involved a surrender of the Tenancy. At these same Assizes one Ralph Wallensis should be noticed as standing Surety for Ralph de Sanford in a suit which concerned possessions of the latter in Rothal (Ruthall near Ditton Priors) . Among some Pleas in Banco which appear to belong to Michael mas Term 1204, the following is entered : \u2014 \" Ralph de Samford offered himself against Griffin, son of Gervord, and Wilikin, his man, and Robert Cocus (and five others) in a plea of appeal. And they (the Defendants) are not forthcoming, neither have they essoigned themselves, and though they should be under pledges (to appear) the Sheriff has sent the names of none (such Sureties). Therefore the Court decided that they should give sufficient pledges for their appearance in Court, on the Octaves of St. Martin, to answer herein, and that the Sheriff do also attend to show why, &c.\" (he had neglected the former order of the Court).63 On the day named (Oct. 18) \" Ralph de Sanford appeared against William, the man of Griffin, and others, in a plea of land \" (as the Evidences, thus proving that the San fords were interested in its preservation and that it concerned the very hide of laud which they afterwards held. 61 Inquisitions, 17 Edw.

So a stringent order is made on all parties to be in Court on the Quinzaine of St. Hilary (Jan. 27, 1206) .6t The Rolls of that Term are lost, but we have Rolls of Easter Term 1206, which say nothing of the continuance of this Suit. We may, therefore, conclude that it had been settled in the interval ; and in extraordinary corroboration of such an idea a Charter happens to be found in a private collection, of which the substance is as follows : \u2014 Grifin, son of Gervase Goh, gives and concedes to Ralph de Sanford one hide of land in Brockton for his homage and service, viz. that hide which Ralph Walensis held ; \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs, rendering 2*. yearly. \u2014 For this, Sanford had given the Grantor twenty-six merks, and had acquieted him in that appeal in which he had drawn him into a Suit in the Court of the Lord the King. He also grants that the said Ralph shall have pannage in his wood oft Sutton for all the swine which shall be reared on said hide of land.65 Thus did Ralph de Sanford, Lord of Sanford and Ruthall, obtain footing in Sutton. The transaction is described with great accuracy in an Inquest nearly fifty years afterwards, which recounted the several alienations from the Serjeantry of Madoc de Sutton. \" Griffin, Madoc's Father,\" says the Record, \" alienated four virgates\" (equal to a hide) \" of land to Ralph de Saumford, out of the Manor of Sutton.\" The four virgates were at the time of this return worth 40s. per annum?6 The additions which Ralph de Sanford continued to make to this estate are the subject of an interesting series of documeuts, three of which have been already cited, one under Brockton, one under Sutton, and one under Broseley.

He, like his Father, was a Knight. A deed which must have passed between 1241 and 1249, shows Stephen Cude of Brocton, granting to \" Sir Richard, Lord of Sonford \" for the sum of 4s. 6c.. half-an-acre of land in Hemme.76 This Stephen Cude or Keede has already appeared as holding half-a-virgate under Philip de Farlow. He, or his Father William, had also, as we shall presently see, been enfeoffed by Ralph de Sanford in a virgate at Brockton. But to return to Richard de Sanford. \u2014 He appears to have died in 1249, and being a Tenant in capite at Sanford and Ruthall an Inquest was held shortly after, as to his estate.77 The Jurors, among whom were Roger de Bagsore and Ivo de Brocton, said that he had held in Brocton under Sir Madoc de Sutton by service of 2s. per annum -. that he had there half-a-carucate in demesne, which, with its meadows, was worth 20s. per annum ; that he had a Mill there worth 10s. per annum, and rents from Tenants amount ing to \u00a32. 6s. 8d. ; that Ralph de Sanford his son and next heir was 14 years of age. The deceased, as I find from another Record, left a Widow, Ali anora, whose lands were in 1255 estimated at 100s. annual value, and who was then remarried to Richard Burnel.78 The wardship of the heir, Ralph de Sanford, was granted by the King to Germanus Scissor, who selling the same to Odo de Hodnet, the latter obtained the King's Letters Patent dated Sept. 1, 1249, confirming such transfer.79 In Easter Term 1250, Felicia, widow of William Kede, is found suing Stephen Kede for dower in a virgate of land. Stephen called Ralph Sanford (the Minor) to warranty.60 A protracted litigation ensued, for in July 1251, I find Simon de Wanton and Robert de Grendon appointed to try the suit which \" Felicia, widow of William Code, had against Odo de Hodnet and Stephen Code as to a tene ment in Brocton.\"81 n Inquisitiones incerli temporis Hen rici III, No. 111.

At Salop Assizes, January 1256, \" Robert Prudhome challenged Richard Burnel, for that whilst he, Robert (being in the King's- Peace) was in a barn of Odo de Hodenet's at Brocton, on Wednes day, August 11 (1255) Richard came and took away twelve thraves of corn. He (Robert) also charged William Parvus, Stephen Kede, Yvo de Brocton, and Thomas de Wyke, that they were aiding and abetting said Richard. This challenge was declared to be null.82 At the same Assizes there was (in continuation of the former suit) a prosecution under writ of mort d'ancestre by Sibil and Mar gery, daughters of William Kede, against Stephen Kede, to ascer tain whether the said William died seized of half-a-virgate in Brocton, and whether the said Sibil and Margery were his next heirs. Stephen Kede, the Tenant, \" appeared and called to war ranty Ralph, son and heir of Richard de Saunford, who was under age and in custody of Odo de Odenet, by charter of Ralph de Saun ford, grandfather of the aforesaid Ralph, which charter of feoffment he (Stephen) produced.\" The cause was adjourned till Ralph de Saunford should attain his majority.83 This Ralph must have come of age shortly afterwards, but I post pone further mention of him to another occasion, inasmuch as I find little to connect him with Sutton and Brockton beyond his attestation of a few local deeds. He thus attests as a Knight, about 1290, and dying in 1307, left a son Richard, thirty years of age, who has already been mentioned as a Grantee of Fulk le Strange iu March 1308. BURWARDSLEY FEE IN SUTTON AND BROCKTON. I have already adverted to the fact of Griffin de Sutton having enfeoffed Warin de Burwardsley in two virgates here, and have suggested that the said feoffment was in composition of some claim which Warin had, in 1195, on Griffin's Manors of Rowton and Ellardine. Deeds have also been cited, showing that Warin de Burwardsley's estate in Brockton remained to Philip his son, and that the latter enfeoffed Ralph de Sanford in one-half of the pre- Patent of the same time shows Richard Burnell and Alianore his wife, in litiga tion with Odo de Hodnet about their respective rights at Sandford.

I neither find what became of the other virgate nor any subsequent notice of a mesne interest here continuing with the heirs of Burwardsley. Iu 1251, however, these two virgates are mentioned and recognized as a distinct tenement, of the annual value of two merks, but nothing whatever is said of their occupa tion at the time.84 COCUS FEE IN BROCKTON. The Record last quoted specifies another alienation made by Griffin de Sutton in this Manor. It was of one virgate to Elyas Cocus at a rent of 2s., and this land was in 1251 worth 15s. per annum. Accordingly we have Elias or Helias Cocus a witness in various deeds ranging in date from the year 1194 to 1231. \" H elyas Coquus granted to Wombridge Priory for the health of his soul an acre of land at Brocton in the field called Bedlesdun.\"85 He also granted to the same, in composition of a certain debt, three acres in the field of Brocton for a term of twenty years, com mencing Oct. 26, 1231. 86 Contemporary with Helias Cocus was Robert Cocus, whose rent of 12-?. payable to Griffin Goch we have already seen transferred by the latter to Wombridge Priory. The successor of Helias Cocus was William Cocus, whose grant of half his estate (half-a-virgate) to Ralph de Sanford, reserving 6d. rent, has been cited as having passed between 1231 and 1235. The sequel of this name and Tenure will be best shown by a few extracts from the Wombridge Chartulary. \u2014 John Ithell de Brocton grants to William Cocus an acre of three Matilda was fortified ; and Sir R. de Novavilla, the Chancellor, was elected Archbishop ; and E was the Sunday letter.\" The deed was also written \" on the 7th of the kalends of November in that year.\" It was about July 1231 that Henry III rebuilt Castle Matilda in El vein : soon after AugU3t 2, 1231, Ralph de Nevill, Bishop of Chichester and Chan cellor, was elected Archbishop of Canter bury ; and E was the Sunday letter of 1231.

TENURE OF BEGESOUR IN SUTTON AND BROCKTON. I have already said that William de Begesour, who, about 1174, sold his inheritance at Badger, appears to have left successors else where. That he should have an interest in Brockton becomes the more probable inasmuch as the Fief of his Suzerains, the Lords of Richard's Castle, at one time extended to that quarter. However 1 cannot determine the mode in which his presumed descendants, the Begesours of Brockton, held their lands. Their deeds are unattended by any confirmation or consent of a superior Lord, and yet it is certain that they were not Tenants in capite. Of this family William de Begesour occurs from 1194 to 1232; also Roger son and heir of William occurs during his Father's life time and subsequently till about 1263. Contemporary with both Father and Son was Richard de Begesour already mentioned. The son and heir of Roger was a second William, occurring from about 1268 to 1280. A Richard occurs about 1300, a third William in 1316, and Thomas in 1341, all being distinctly of Brockton and in no way confounded with the family of the same name which held a higher position at Badger. Of the persons thus named I find little more than their names. \u2014 William de Beggesoure approves and attests about 1230 a transfer 87 Ibidem, No. xxiv. \u2014 Tested by Ma doc de Sutton, Hugh de Hadinton, Rich ard de Grenhull. 83 Ibidem, No. xlij.\u2014 Tested by Sir Wal ter de Dunstanvill, Walter de Huggeford, Madoc de Sutton, Odo de'Hodenet, Wal ler de Kembriton, Herbert de Tdeshal.

Richard Fitz Edith and Thomas de Brocton.01 The second William de Begesour had three transactions with Wombridge Priory, the first a small grant, the other two ex changes.93 His amercement for some default at the Forest Assizes of Nov. 1.271, is all that I find further noticeable, either as regards him or the continuators of his name at Brockton.93 HARRINGTON formerly HADDINGTON. This was undoubtedly a member of the Domesday Manor of Sutton and so continued till the death of Hamo Peverel, about 1136. In 1157, part of Harrington (a virgate) went still with Sutton and the other Tornai lands, then obtained by Gervase Goch ; but the re mainder (more than 4 virgates) was not thus involved, probably as having been previously bestowed elsewhere. I will first speak of the virgate obtained by Gervase Goch. \u2014 A Record already quoted, informs us that Griffin (son of Gervase), enfeoffed Hugh de Beckbury therein, by service of 12c.. (rent), and that its full value was then (1251) 10s. per annum?4* This fact is sufficiently illustrated by a number of Sutton and Brockton Deeds which, passing in the first quarter of the 13th century, have the attes tation of this Hugh de Beckbury. His marriage, presently to be noticed, had given him a footing in Harrington before he obtained the feoffment of Griffin Goch, and at his death, which must have happened about Dec. 1226, he was possessed of other interests in this Manor or Township. He left two sons, necessary to be mentioned here, John and Hugh. Griffin de Sutton's Feoffment having probably been limited to Hugh and his heirs, the virgate under notice will have descended Sutton, John de Grenhull, Ivo de Broc ton, Richard Burnel, Adam Pollard of Lee, Oliver de Knolle. 90 Wombridge Chartulary.

Madoc de Sutton's seignoral interest in this parcel of land be comes again apparent in 1256, when his Concession of Sutton to Wombridge Priory includes \" rents and escheats of Hedinton.\" However a moiety of this virgate seems at some subsequent period to have reverted to the Lord of the Fee. Hence in 1284, it was found of a virgate here that Fulk le Strange held half thereof in capite of the King, whilst Philip de Bechebur held the other half under Fulk.95 I find no later notice of this virgate in Harrington, and conclude that it became again absorbed in the Parent Manor of Sutton. The other and greater part of Harrington followed a succession liable to be confused with, but essentially distinct from, the parcel thus far treated of. At the time of Gervase Goch's acquisition of Sutton (1157), this land had probably been bestowed elsewhere. However about March 1163, it fell into the King's hands, by death or forfeiture of the former Grantee ; consequently at Michaelmas 1163, the Sheriff renders account \"of the ferm of Hadinton, escheated land which was Gerard de Turnai's ; viz. for half a year 20s.\"96 About this time, the name of Roger Mussun occurs more than once on the Shropshire Pipe -Rolls among those who were in the service and favour of King Hemy II. That King also, when, about the year 1175, he visited Shrews bury, expedited a charter whereby he gave \"to Roger Mussun, his Servant, Uppington under Mount-Gilbert \" and, what is more to our present purpose, \" 50 solidates of land in Heddinton which had been Hamo Peverel-' s, and were near to Bruges\" (written Burgam). The service retained by the King on the whole grant, was the payment of one sore Sparrow-hawk yearly, by said Roger and his heirs.97 I shall here say briefly of Roger Mussun that he was a Benefactor to Wombridge Priory, and that dying about the year 1191, he left a Widow, Galiena, and at least nine daughters and Coheiresses to share his estates. Harrington, whose estimated extent seems to have been four-and-a-half virgates, was accordingly divided into several shares. Galiena, the Widow, had half-a-virgate, two of the 95 Kirby's Quest. The Record is not very clear on this matter, but I doubt not that such is its intended meaning. 96 Rot. Pip. 9 Hen. II, Salop. 97 Wombridge Chartulary. Tit.

Juliana, wife of * * * Corbrond, and Sibil, wife of Richard de Bruges, had half-a-virgate each, Alina, wife of Hugh de Beckbury, had a share which, with the other shares (however allotted in the first instance), amounted to three virgates, and eventually centred in Hugh the second son of the said Hugh and Alina, and in Muota, daughter of the same Hugh, junior. Galiena, Widow of Roger Mussun, gave her half-virgate in frank almoigne to Wombridge Priory, for the soul of her Husband and Parents.98 The Priory leased it to Philip the Chaplain, for a term of years, but afterwards (about 1220) granted it to Adam de Cherleton (husband of Alice, another of the aforesaid Coheiresses) in exchange for a parcel of land at Uppinton.99 All I shall further say of this half-virgate is, that Richard de la Buri, Great-grandson of Adam and Alice, occurs in 1284 as holding it in capite of the King,100 and that in 1292 he was still Tenant thereof, though the King had in the interim granted the seigneury of all that was implied by the payment of the aforesaid Sparrow-hawk to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells.101 So also the half-virgate in Harrington, which after her Father's death was allotted to Juliana Corbrond, is found in 1284 and 1292 to be similarly held by Richard Corebrond, her Great-grandson and representative. The half-virgate of Sibil de Bruges did not so long remain with her descendants, though it reached the hands of her Great-grandson also. He, viz. Richard, son of Richard de Bruges, sold it, with the messuage thereon, about 1264, for 40s. and a \\d. rent, to Jane, widow of Hugh de Beckbury.102 She in turn granted it to Wom bridge, on condition that at her death her body should be buried at the Priory, her name written in the \" Martyrology\" of the House, Mussun (Brother of Roger), Ralph de Perrin, Robert Angevin, Adam de Wroc worthin, &c. 93 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

The Prior's Tenure was, in fact, no longer in capite nor any concern of the Crown. I now come to the residue of this Tenure, viz. three virgates which went to Hugh de Beckbury and Alina his wife, daughter and coheir of Roger Mussun, or were acquired by their descendants from the other coheirs. This Hugh, who, be it remembered, had a distinct interest here as Feoffee of Griffin de Sutton, was also Lord of Beckbury, and an important personage in many other respects. Confining myself now to his Tenures in Harrington, I shall merely notice some quarrel which he had with a neighbour of equal consequence. Walter, Lord of Higford, claimed a right of common-pasture in Harrington, whereof this Hugh disseized him. Walter laid his complaint before King Henry III, when that Monarch, in Septem ber 1224, was at Shrewsbury with his Justiciars. Sentence was given in the Plaintiff's favour, and Hugh was moreover amerced two merks for the offence. The King, however, passing to Mont gomery, despatched a writ dated at that place on October 1 , whereby the Sheriff of Shropshire was ordered to discharge Hugh of half this fine, a favour probably shown to Hugh as a sometime Servant of the Crown, and at this very moment Chief Bailiff of the Kind's Hundred of Bradford. Hugh paid the balance of the fine, but instead of acquiescing in the judgment given against him, proceeded to plough and sow the common-land in dispute. In August 1226, the King was again at Shrewsbury, and Walter de Hugford made a second complaint. Hugh appeared, and at first denied the charge ; but presently admitting it, he was adjudged to pay 20s. damages, for which Walinger de Sydenhale and Walter de Harpcote stood his Sureties.101 This Hugh de Beckbury was living in October 1226, but deceased before March 1227. His Wife Alina survived him at least ten years, but both were eventually succeeded at Harrington by their 103 Ibidem, Nos. iij, iv. lu4 Placita coram Rege, 10 Henry III, 1 Salop. Rot. Claus. 8 Hen.

This Hugh became a much more important person than his elder Brother John. In 1229, he was already a Knight and stirring in the affairs of the County. He acquired property at Oldbury, Diddlebury, and Acton Burnell. About 1251, his interests in Harrington are thus described : \u2014 \" Hugh de Bekebur' is Tenant by gift of his Ancestors (who held part of Upton (Uppington) which is holden of the King in capite) of two virgates in Hadinton; by what service is unknown.

However the service i_ unknown.\"105 \u2014 The service due on Hugh's Tenure in Harrington was involved in the Sore Sparrow-hawk, paid by his Relations, the Coheirs of Uppington, by whom, or some of whom, he, his Father, or his daughter had been thus enfeoffed in Harrington. In 1255, Hugh de Beckbury was farming the Hundred of Bradford under the Sheriff at an annual rent of thirty-three merks.106 The extortions of some his Deputies in this, his office of Bailiff, were loudly complained of at the Inquest of 1255 by the Jurors of H ales- Owen. One Roger de Hales having, it appears, been amerced by Roger de Turkelby for some offence, Hugh de Beckbury's Beadles, or Sub-Bailiffs, made four successive seizures in satisfaction of the single debt thus incurred.107 At the Assizes of January 1256, Hugh de Beckbury had lost his Bailiwick, or Bailiwicks, for I think he had been Fermor of more than one Shropshire Hundred. He was, however, one of the two principal Jurors of Brimstree Hundred, whose office it was to choose their ten Colleagues. He is here called Hugh de Hadington.108 At these same Assizes, he was involved in a double law-suit with Madoc de Sutton. He was sued by the latter for having disseized him (Madoc) of a right of common in Hadinton, and was convicted. Neither was he successful in certain counter-charges which he endeavoured to establish against Madoc, viz. that he (Madoc) \" to 103 Testa de Nevill, so. 275. names alternately, so that a reader, not aware of the identity, must fail to under stand the story altogether. 105 Rot Hund. ii, 58. >\u00b07 Ibidem II, 68.

Of this how ever presently. \u2014 In April 1263, this Hugh was deceased, leaving a widow, Johanna, and a son and heir, Thomas. Of his daughter Muota, I learn nothing further than that her interest in Harrington seems to have reverted to her Brother or his Assignees. Johanna, or Jane, Widow of Hugh de Becl-bury, has already been mentioned more than once.110 I can say little more of her than that in 1267 she appears, as Ida, widow of Hugh de Beck bury, to have fined half-a-merk for license to accord some law-suit : and that again in April 1271, she had proffered a similar sum for some writ of thc King. In the last case she is called Johanna.111 Thomas de Beckbury, Son and Heir of Hugh, succeeded him at Harrington ; but about September 1270, sold all his interest there to Nicholas de Hugford, and, inter alia, his interest in that messuage and virgate which Thomas Corbet had now held for fourteen-and-a quarter years. Nicholas de Hugford forthwith ejected Thomas Corbet, whereupon the latter sued the said Nicholas, laying his damages at _\u00a3100. The cause was tried at Salop Assizes, October 1272, when the Parties pleaded the various circumstances already detailed, Nicholas de Hugford asserting however, that Hugh de Beckbury, Father of Thomas, had died seized of the virgate in question, so that it descended to Thomas his (Nicholas') Feoffor. In reply to this, Corbet offered to produce the deed of lease (dimissionis), adding that Hugh de Beckbury was at his death only so seized of the premises as having been appointed his (Corbet's) Bailiff. On this issue Corbet puts himself on the Country, and Nicholas likewise, appointing however his powerful neighbour (and probably relation) William de Hugford as his Attorney against so weighty an Antagonist as the Baron of Caus. The Jury found in due course that Hugh de Beckbury died seized of the premises, and that \" Corbet had nothing therein\" under his alleged deed. He was therefore in misericordid.113 109 Ibidem, memb. 14 and 13 dorso. 111 Rot. Pip. 51 Hen. Ill, Salop. Rot.

It contains nearly 500 Instruments referring to property which can hardly be estimated to have extended over twice as many acres. An Epitome of various grants to this house by Donniger, Brusebon, John the Clerk, and other Under-Tenants in Brockton, &c, has already been printed.

An independent and nearly contemporary grant thereof to the same Priory was made by Henry II, who treats the Advowson as the undivided right of the Crown. It appears however, from the King's Charter, that some negotiation on the subject had taken place previously, for he reserves the life-interest of Ralph the Clerk (the Rector I presume) \" in conformity with the convention already made between the said Ralph and the Canons.\"114 Hugford was summoned to give account of his Tenure on a future day. The Prior of Wombridge however appeared, as before stated, and his account of the Tenure will have apphed to Hugford's interest as well as his own.

Dec. 29, 1258, Ralph the Dean, and the Chapter of Lichfield inspected and, for their part, confirmed Bishop Roger's Charter.121 April 28, 1262, William the Prior and the Convent of Coventry did the same.133 In 1281, some question had arisen as to the Taxation or Or dination of this Church, i. e. the proportions of its income which should be allotted to the Vicar before the Impropriators received the residue. The Bishop's Official writes on March 5th to the Official of the Archdeacon of Salop, alluding to an inquiry, which the latter had been previously ordered to make on the subject, and acknowledging the receipt of his report resulting from such inquiry, but at the same time stating that he (the Bishop's Official) is not thereby fully informed. The Archdeacon's Official is therefore to cite the Prior and Canons of Wombridge to appear on a certain Saturday,133 at Stafford, before himself (the Bishop's Official), and there in the Church of the Canons (St. Thomas the Martyr's) exhibit an instrument, if they have one, as to the last Taxation of Sutton Vicarage. And, not to leave the matter liable to the contingency of the Canons producing such a document, \u2014 the Archdeacon's Official is to cite the Rectors, Vicars, and Chaplains, who live nearest to Sutton, and twelve honest Laymen who best know the true value of the said Church, to appear before the Bishop's Official or his Commissaries, on May 31, in the Parish Church of Wombridge, to give information on the point. The Archdeacon's Official is also to attend himself, and to inform the Prior and Canons that they may attend if they think better to do so.134 The truth is, I suppose, that the Priory had no such Instrument of Taxation, but in default of Episcopal interference had interpreted their right of Appropriation with a view to their own interests. The stringent course proposed by Bishop Roger de Meuland's Official does not seem to have led to any immediate result. However, on March 15, 1285, a Charter of that Prelate settles the matter and embodies the particulars of his \" Ordination of the Vicarage of Sutton juxta Bruges.\" \u2014 viz. \u2014 \" The Vicar for the time being shall have a sufficient House on the Glebe (in solo ecclesiastico) , and half-a-virgate of land: also all Mortuaries, the tithe of hay in Sutton and Hadyngton, the tithes 121 Ibidem, Tit.

The Bishop therefore dismisses them as the true and Canonical Rectors of this Church.127 In the year 1315, the Archdeacon of Salop visiting Sutton Church, heard that the Canons of Wombridge had withdrawn two processional candles which they were bound to maintain in the Chancel of the said Church. The Parishioners, represented by Roger Brusebon and two others, moved a suit in the Archidiaconal Court against the Canons. A sentence releasing them from the alleged obligation was given in full Chapter at Newport on Nov. 4, 1315, and certified by the Archdeacon's Official.138 In 1341, though the Taxation of Sutton Church stood at 7 merks (\u00a3i. 13s. id.), the Assessors of the ninth, only rated the Parish at \u00a33. because the small tithes, oblations, glebe, and other spiritualities of the Church went to make up the greater sum, and had nothing to do with the ninth ; and because the Vicar had half-a-virgate of land, and because four virgates of land lay unfilled.129 The Canons of Wombridge obtained other confirmations of their Chartered and Impropriate rights at Sutton, viz. from Bishop Robert (de Stretton), dated at Heywode, July 25, 1362, from Bishop Johu (Bourghill), dated at Eccleshall Castle, Sept. 21, 1400, and from Thomas (Fitz Alan), Archbishop of Canterbury, dated at Lambeth, Feb. 8, 1401. 1S0 125 Ibidem, No. xcix and c compared. 120 Taxatio Papa Nich. p. 248. \u2014 De- May 8, 1320. 128 Ibidem, No. ex. canatus Novi Burgi. 129 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 184. 130 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

Radulf the Clerk, the Incumbent of 1187, was probably the last resident Rector of Sutton. He seems to have been followed by the Deputies of Wombridge Priory, styled at first Chaplains or Priests, and afterwards Vicars. Thus we have between 1194 and 1219 mention of Hugh, Chaplain of Sutton or of Brockton, and also notices of one Richard, called indifferently Chaplain of Sutton or Priest of Brockton. In the next twelve years we hear of Philip the Chaplain as an occupier of land at Harrington, and find him attesting deeds as \" Sir Philip, Chaplain of Sutton.\" From 1231, for thirty years, we find repeated mention of Nicholas, at first called Priest (Sacerdos), then Chaplain of Sutton, and lastly Vicar of the same. Then, between 1265 and 1280, Henry de Ideshale, Chaplain, a benefactor to Wombridge Priory, seems to be identical with Henry, Vicar of Sutton, and with \" Sir Henry, Vicar of Brockton.\" In the last twenty years of the Century, Sir William, Chaplain of Sutton, occurs.133 On April 12, 1302, the Bishop sequestered the Vicarage of Sutton in the Archdeaconry of Salop, for some cause which does not appear. The Dean of Newport is ordered, out of the income of the Vicarage, to provide for due service of the Church. Thomas, Vicar of Sutton Madok, having died January 7, 1330, John dk Opynton, Chaplain, is admitted to the Vicarage on Feb. 18th following, at presentation of the Prior and Convent of 131 Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 194.

Scoc (a village, or place of habitation) and tun (a town or inclosure) are the two words hitherto supposed to enter into this compound.1 The redundancy of signification which thus arises suggests however another etymology, and that more consistent with pro nunciation. The Saxon word Stoc (with the unaccentuated or short o) means \" the stock \" or \" trunk of a tree \" and so \" wood \" or \"fuel\" generally. Stockton therefore signifies \"the town of thewood,\" and so involves precisely the same ideas as another and still more common Saxon name, now written Wootton or Wotton, but anciently Wudeton or Wodeton.

Escheats, the Manor next appears as held in capite of the Crown, and by Serjeantry of service at Shrawardine Castle. The earliest Crown-Tenants had name from the place, but the documents in which they occur are so little connected, that I attempt no fuller account of their succession than will be implied by citing those documents in chronological order. About 1196, Adam de Stocton, with Robert and Gilbert his Brothers, attests a Charter of the second William Fitz Alan to Reyner de Lee.3 At Michaelmas 1196, Adam de Stocton and Matilda his wife had fined two merks with the King, that they might have trial against Richard Pechie concerning half a Knight's- fee in Cupton in Warwickshire.4 At Michaelmas 1204, Herbert de Stocton had paid half a merk, the sum assessed on 1 hide of land for King John's fifth scutage, which (as I have said before) was levied on Tenants by Serjeantry as well as upon Tenants by Knights' service. At Michaelmas 1207, Herbert de Stocton had been amerced, apparently by Justices of the Forest. The same thing had recurred in 1209.5 Comparing two Rolls of Tenures by Serjeantry, of date about 1211, I find it stated that Matilda de Stocton held land by service of finding one serving foot-soldier with a bow, for ward of Shra wardine Castle.6 About this time Robert de Stocton occurs as second witness of a charter quoted under Badger, and the same Robert sat as a Juror on a Forest Inquisition, of date about June 1220. 7 On the 13th of July 1243, a King's Writ ordered an Inquest to be held as to the estate of Walter de Stocton, deceased. The Jury (among whom were Walter de Kenbricton, William de Sutton, and Philip de Stocton) found that Walter had held 4 virgates in the vill of Stocton, by service of one foot-soldier with a bow and arrows for 15 days at Montgomery; \u2014 that the tenure was worth 3 Harl.

A Commission accordingly issued in 1246 to Henry de Wingeham, who was at the same time appointed Escheator citra Trent, to make inquest into these alienations. He with an associate Knight in each County, and a Jury if he pleased, were to inquire into the state of all Ser jeantries. Subsequently, and probably on receipt of Wingeham's reports, a second Commission issued to Robert Passelewe, Archdeacon of Lewes and Treasurer to King Henry III, in virtue of which he visited very many Counties to \"take fines\" or \"make ar r dilations'\" of Serjeantries, that is to provide for the due fulfilment of the ser vices attached to every such tenure, and also to exact and fix an annual rent in money as a composition for every illegal alienation. Passelewe seems to have taken Shropshire early in his progress, at least the Arrentations which he fixed here accrued from March 1247, while he is found to be in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon shire in April 1250. The results of Passelewe's visit to Shropshire are preserved in duplicate. It was found that the \" Serjeantry of John le Bret (which was formerly Henry de Stockton's, in Stockton, for which he wras bound to provide for the Lord King one serving foot-soldier with bow and arrows, for fifteen days, at his own cost, in garrison of Shrawardine Castle in time of war, which, service was afterwards attorned to Montgomery Castle) was alienated altogether from the right heirs.\" It further appeared that Philip de Stocton held three-fourths of a virgate, worth 4s. per annum, of the said aliena tion and that John le Bret held the residue thereof, being of 10s. annual value. \u2014 John le Bret concluded the following Fine for himself and the other Tenant, with the consent of the latter, viz. that they would pay 4s. annually (to the Crown) and perform the prescribed service.10 8 Inquisitions, 28 Hen.

On the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of Michaelmas 1250, John le Bret's obligations as Tenant of Henry de Stocton's Serjeantry are re peated, and he is put in charge for three-and-a-half years' arrears of the 4s. rent agreed upon. About 1251, an Inquest of Tenures in Brimstree Hundred speaks of this Serjeantry as Richard de Stocton's, values it at 20s. per annum, and notes its total alienation to John le Bret.11 What became of the Alienator of this Serjeantry I do not find ; but as late as 1259 an entry on the Pipe Roll charges Richard Lord of Stockton with an amercement of 3s. id. for some non attendance. To return to John le Bret. \u2014 In 1250, Justices are appointed to try a suit of novel disseizen which he had against Oliver, Parson of Stocton Church, and others concerning a tenement in Stocton.12 At the Assizes of January 1256, the Brimstree Jurors reported John le Bret as failing in due attendance. A Seigneury over these Tenants by Serjeantry seems to have been granted to the Stranges about the time when the latter established their interest in Sutton and Brockton. At the same time John le Bret disappears as Tenant; for at the Assizes of October 1272, the Brimstree Jurors reported Philip de Say as holding Little Stocton of Robert le Strange (of Sutton), in Serjeantry, for which he paid the King 4s. per annum. And this Philip de Say (probably identical with Philip de Stocton above mentioned) was Foreman of the Jury which sat on Sept. 13, 1276, to inquire as to the estate of Robert le Strange who had previously deceased. Again within a few years the name of the Tenant of Stockton changes ; for in 12 Edw. I (1283-4), Robert Body had the King's grant of Free- Warren in Little Stocton, and in Herdwyke within the Hundred of Ellesmere.13 The Inquisition of 1284 gives a confused account of this Manor, the result probably of Fulk le Strange, then a Minor, holding it in capite together with Sutton and part of Brockton. The Record first says that \" Fulco Extraneus holds the Manor of Stocton cum Brocton of the King in capite, by service of one Knight for fifteen days, to go with the King into Wales at his own cost ;\" and that \" the same Fulco pay 4s. per annum for purpresture.\" It afterwards says that \"Robert Body holds Little Stocton (by serjeantry of finding one foot-soldier for forty days at his own cost with a bow and four arrows) of the King in capite.\"u 13 Rot.

About the same time Robert Bodi attests a Brockton Deed, whereby John, the Clerk surrenders his Tenancy to Wombridge Priory.15 The aggregate service and serjeantry reported by the Brimstree Jurors of 1292 as due on Sutton, evidently includes Fulk le Strange's particular liability in respect of Stockton. At these Assizes however Robert Body the Tenant was questioned as to his right of Free- Warren in his demesne lands at Stockton. Not at first appearing, his alleged right of Warren was ordered to be escheated, but he afterwards came forward and pleaded the King's Charter, and so was dismissed sine die}6 The Feodary of 1316, makes no distinct mention of Stockton, evidently because it was deemed to be involved in Fulk le Strange's Tenure of Sutton.

The Jurors of the Liberty of Brug reported this alienation in that year.19 13 Sept. 1276, Nicholas, Clerk of Eudinas, was a Juror on the Inquest concerning the estate of Robert le Strange of Sutton and Stockton. I find no further mention of this Serjeantry or any probable Tenants thereof. I conclude it to have been re-united to Le Strange's Tenure. STOCKTON CHURCH. I have no proof of a Church existing here before the thirteenth Century, but there is a strong probability that the Foundation was much earlier. In 1291, the Church of Stocton with its Chapel (or Chapels) was returned as annually worth =\u20ac4. 13s. id. besides a pension of 6s. 8d. which the Prior of St. Guthlac of Hereford received therefrom.20 The only Chapel which I can suggest to be here indicated is Boningale, -which remains to this day a member of the Church of Stockton. Now Boningale, at the time of Domesday and for nearly two centuries afterwards, was manorially a member of Higford, and the latter was in the Parish of Stockton. The Lacis who held Higford under the Norman Earl had, before Domesday, given that Manor to one of their principal Feoffees : but at the same period (1085-6), these Lacis were zealous in the endowment and re-establishment of Hereford Priory. That House, dedicated to St. Guthlac, held pensions afterwards in very many Churches of De Laci's Fief. I doubt not therefore that De Laci, Seigneural Lord of Higford, was Founder or Co-Founder of Stockton Church, at a period very shortly subsequent to Domesday, and that St. Guthlac's pension was 18 Testa de Nevill, folio 254. One whose name is written Walter de Deuines was a juror to try causes of O-rand Assize at Salop in 1221. I doubt not that he was the individual under no tice. 19 Rot. Hund. ii, 59. 20 Pope Nich.

In 1341, the Taxation of Stockton Church stood at seven-and-a half merks (=\u20ac5), a sum which included the aforesaid pension. The Parish was however assessed only at five merks to the ninth, the usual deductions in respect of small tithes, glebe, offerings, and other spiritualities having been allowed in reckoning the assess ment, as also a murrain which had recently destroyed the sheep of the district.21 In 1534, the Rectory of Stoketon with the Chapel of Bonynghal in the Deanery of Newport, was valued at \u00a314, which sum was chargeable with 6s. 8d. for Procurations and 2s. 3d. for Synodals, but with no pension of the kind before described.23 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Nicholas, Chaplain of Stocton, attests a deed already cited under Badger, and which passed early in the thirteenth Century. He will hardly have been more than a Deputy of the then Incumbent. Oliver, Parson of Stocton, has also been mentioned under date of 1250, and must be identical with that Oliver de Stocton who stands first witness to a nearly contemporarv deed of Madoc de Sutton.23 William de Hugford, Clerk, was instituted Rector of this Church by Commission, on May 31, 1321. On Oct. 30 following, he had license to study for a year, and on Nov. 5, had letters dimissory for Junior Orders and the Orders of Subdeacon and Deacon. On March 18, 1323, he had further license for a year's study and non-residence, and on Feb. 14, he had a still further dispensation for another year, to commence on March 18 foUow.no-.2* He occurs as Rector about 1343. Walter de Hugford, Rector of Stockton, died in 1369, and on November 12, in that year, Philip de Harley, Priest, late Rector of Stirchley, was presented by Walter de Hugford, Lord of Hugford. He died in 1379 on the 4th of July, in which year Master Thomas de Kyrkeby, Priest, was presented by William de Huo-ford.26 21 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 184. \" Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 187. 24 Lichfield Registers, sub annis. 2i Elakeway's MSS. 23 Supra, p. 120."], [651, "149 r ftHmtjijtmt. The etymology of this word is obvious. \u2014 At an unrecorded period, earlier than the days of King Edward the Confessor, the \" town\" was possessed or founded by some Saxon \" Alberic.\" The latter name, variously written and pronounced as Alberic, Albrecht, Albert, or Aubrey, is fundamentally the same, and has its exact equivalent in the Latin word Pr\u00e6clarus or in the Greek TIepipctvvic. The Manor is thus described in Domesday : \u2014 The same Normannus holds Albricstoue. Algar and Godhit held it (in time of King Edward) for two Manors. Here is one hide and-a-half geldable. The (arable) land is (sufficient) for mi ox teams. In demesne are in such teams; and (there are) xin serfs and in villains and in boors with i team. Here is a wood which will fatten 100 swine : but at present it is in the King's hand. In time of King Edward, the Manor was valued at xxi shillings (per annum) . Its present value is xvi shillings. He (Norman) found it waste.\" l I think that the first-named of the two Saxons, who had had an interest in Albrighton must have been Algar, Earl of Mercia. His possessions in the neighbouring County of Staffordshire were extensive, and included Pattingham, a Manor not far distant from Albrighton. Earl Algar's Staffordshire Fief was generally retained by King WUliam the Conqueror in demesne. Hence perhaps, the Domesday mention of a wood at Albrighton, so singularly excepted from the jurisdiction of the Palatine Earl of Shropshire.2 Norman Venator (for such was the designation of the Domesday Lord of Albrighton) held seven Manors under Earl Roger. His profession, perhaps also the service by which he held his lands, is implied by his name. With his Brother Roger, also called Venator, he has been mentioned as attending the Consecration of Quatford Church in 1086, and he further appears to have been living after the succession of Earl Hugh (1093), and to have been a Benefactor 1 Domesday, so. 259, a. 2. 2 This wood was, I doubt not, retained by the King with a view to the integrity or enlargement of the neighbouring Forest of Brewood ; of which, as a Royal Forest, I have yet to speak. 20 II."], [652, "150 ALBRIGHTON. to Shrewsbury Abbey. The locality of two of his Domesday Manors is somewhat uncertain, but in the five which can be better identified he seems to have been succeeded by the family of Pichford, whom I therefore conclude to have been his heirs. These Pichfords continued for two centuries to hold the Fief of Norman Venator, immediately of the Crown. Albrighton was its reputed Caput, and the whole constituted a tenure held by service of one Knight's-Fee, and was so assessed to the various Scutages and Aids which were levied during that period. Of Ralph de Pichford, who distinguished himself and added to his possessions by services rendered to King Henry I at the siege of Brug in 1102, I have already spoken. All that I can further say of him is, that he attests a very ancient deed, in the time of Henry I or Stephen, which concerns land in this neighbourhood. Mention has also been made, under Ryton, of Richard and Engelard, pre sumed to have been the two sons of Ralph de Pichford. Richard de Pichford seems to have died before 1157, leaving a son and heir, another Richard, whose wardship (he being a Minor and a Tenant in capite) was then purchased of the Crown by his Uncle Engelard. Though, as will presently appear, this minority must have been very brief, it left Engelard de Stretton possessed of a considerable interest in his Nephew's lands. I shall quote instances of this elsewhere, but here will mention only the following peculiar cir cumstance.\u2014In the year 1167 (when Richard de Pichford had long attained his majority), the town of Albrictone had been amerced in the sum of one merk for some breach of the Forest-Laws, which had been adjudicated upon in the recent Iter of Alan de Nevill. The fine is however described on the Pipe-Roll as being set upon the town of \" Albrictone Engerardi\" i. e. Engelard's Albrighton, as though Engelard was then its owner, while it is clear, from other evidence, that if stUl interested there, he could only have been so interested as a Tenant. This Richard de Pichford, of whom we are principally speaking, was he, who having acquired or inherited an interest in the neigh bouring Manor of Cospelford (Cosford), granted to the Abbey of BuUdwas the whole service of Richard Crasset therein.3 Richard de Pichford's grant to Haghmon Abbey is all that I can further say of him. It has been already set forth, and, at the time \u2022, Monasticon, v, 359 ; xvi."], [653, "151 ALBRIGHTON. of its passing (before 1172), Hugh, the son and heir of Richard, was old enough to be a consenting party.* On Richard's death, in or before 1176, this same Hugh succeeded him, and, whether a Minor or not, obtained his Livery by pay ment of 100 shillings relief to the Crown.6 In 1185, Hugh de Pikeford had been fined 40s. by Justices of the Forest, for not producing those for whom he was Surety. He had paid the fine, and was quit. At Michaelmas 1194 the Scutage for King Richard's redemp tion having been collected, Hugh de Pichford had paid 20s. on that account, the sum assessed on every Knight's-Fee held in capite. In 1195 he was assessed similarly for King Richard's second Scutage in support of the French wars. This Charge is entered on the Sheriff's Roll of 1 1 96, and had been paid before Michaelmas 1197. At the latter period King Richard's third Scutage had been put in charge. It was at the same rate for each Knight's Fee and was again for the Army of Normandy. It was assessed upon, and paid by, Hugh de Pichford. In the years 1199, 1201-2-3-4-5-6, he was successively charged with the seven first scutages of King John ; but some of these assessments imply a composition in lieu of personal service, and are in excess of the current assessment on a single Knight's-Fee, e. g. he was charged 40s. in 1199, though the current rate was \u00a31. 6s. 8d. per fee; he was charged five merks (.\u20ac3. 6s. 8d.) in 1203, the rate being again \u00a31. 6s. 8d. ; he was charged six merks in 1204, the rate being two-and-a-half merks; and he was charged three merks in 1206, the rate being one-and-a-half merks. Thus much as an instance of the heavy and constant exactions with which King John impoverished and disgusted the Feudatories of his Crown. \u2014 Amongst Fines made in the year 1199, with Hugh de Nevill, Justice of the Forest, I find one of twelve merks contracted by Hugh de Pichford. It was, that he might assart forty acres of his own land at Pichford and twenty acres in his wood of Bruwude (Brewood). In 121 1, he was returned as a Knight, holding one fee by military service, of the Crown, his lands being worth \u00a38. per annum? 4 Supra, Vol. I, p. 358.

And about this time he died, leaving by his wife Burga, daughter and sole heir of Ralph de Baskerville,7 a son Ralph, who succeeded him. I have already noticed this Ralph, as having succeeded about 1212, to his Tenure by Serjeantry at Little Brug. In 1214, when the Scutage of Poitou was put in charge, at the rate of three merks on each Knight's-Fee, this Ralph paid his due proportion of \u00a32. on the same.8 And thus he continued to be assessed to various Scutages and Aids in the time of Henry III, and in manner following. In 1218, he is charged two merks on the first Scutage of that King's reign; in 1221, 10s. on the Scutage of Biham. In 1224, he was acquitted of the Scutage of Montgomery, probably in respect of personal service, but assessed at the current rate (two merks), to that of Bedford. In 1229, he was similarly assessed to the Scutage of Keri, and in 1230, at the higher rate of three merks to that of Brittany; but Ralph Fitz Nicholas had obtained the King's acquittance of half this charge in his own favour. In 1231, Ralph de Pichford is assessed three merks to the Scutage of Poitou, and in 1232, \u00a31. to that of Elvein, each being at the current rate for a Knight's Fee. In 1235, he was charged two merks for the Aid levied on marriage of the King's Sister.9 Half of this he paid in September 1235, \" by hand of Geoffrey, Provost of Pichford,\" whUst the balance was discharged at Easter 1236, by Adam de Pichford.10 In 1245, he was duly assessed \u00a31. to the Aid, for marriage of the King's Daughter, and in 1246, paid three merks, the sum chargeable on each Knight' s-Fee for the Scutage of Gannok.11 Returning to an earlier period for other incidents in the life of Ralph de Pichford, I find him in November 1221, as a Juror of causes, tried at Shrewsbury by Grand Assize.

He gave the King three hundred merks to have marriage of the heirs, and custody of the lands, late John Fitz Deremot's, in Ireland, until the said heirs should be of age. The King, having taken security for payment of this fine in England, enjoined Maurice Fitz Gerold, Justice of Ireland, to^ give Ralph the necessary seizin. The King's writ bears date at Reading 22d August 1234; and on 16th Feb. following, another writ issued to the Barons of the Exchequer, allowing that payment of Ralph de Picheford's fine should be at the rate of twenty-five merks half yearly.13 Tenure-Rolls of the years 1240 and 1251, exhibit Ralph de Pichford's Tenancy in Albrighton as immediately under the Crown,1* but without further particulars, except that the former RoU in cludes Ryton with Albrighton, a circumstance already remarked upon. On Oct. 5, 1252, Ralph de Pichford was dead, for then did Ralph Fitz Nicholas fine 100 merks with the King for custody of his land and heir, as well as for marriage of the latter.15 The Inquest on his death does not seem to have been held tiU the following year, that is, in obedience to the King's writ of diem clausit extremum, dated 20th April, in the 37th year of his reign.

I shall show under other Shropshire localities the incompleteness of this Inquisition, and that Ralph de Pichford was possessed of interests not therein enumerated.16 In 1254, he, or rather his estate, was charged 40s. to the Aid for Knighting the King's eldest son ; and a similar sum in 1260 for the 12 Rot.

When the King's army stood summoned to meet at Worcester, on July 1, 1277, John de Pychford, Knight, acknowledged his service due on a Knight's Fee at Albricton, and was ready to discharge it in person.18 On March 27, 1278, he was among the principal Knights of the County, who made perambulation between the Bishop of Hereford's lands in Esthampton, and those of Peter Corbet in Wentnor.19 On January 28, 1281, he was one of the four Knights who made Inquest aud report as to the ruinous condition of Brug Castle. The King's Army being under summons to meet at Rhuddlan on Aug. 2, 1282, against the Welsh, John de Pichford attended in acknowledgment of his Tenure, but afterwards departed in conse quence of infirmity.20 In 1284, he is entered as holding the Manor of Albricton with Hunfreyston, Wystan (Whiston), and Bispeston (Bishton), by one Knight's Fee, and by accompanying the King into Wales in time of war, for forty days at his own charges.21 In 1285, the Escheator was ordered to seize into the King's hand, the estate of John de Pichford deceased.22 The King's writ of diem clausit extremum, dated April 13, 1285, and addressed to the same Officer, resulted in an Inquisition held at Pichford, on the 25th of the same month. The Jurors estimated the vill of Albryton, held in capite by one Knight's fee, as realizing \u00a35. Us. 8d. per annum. They also gave account of the tenure of the deceased at Pichford, and reported his son and heir Ralph to be of full age. This Inquisition proved to be unsatisfactory, as well it might. The King, in a writ, dated May 6 following, orders his Escheator to \"make more diligent enquiry,\" and a second Inquest sat at Albrighton on the 24th of the same month. The Manor of Albrighton, with the Advowsons of Albrighton and Ryton, were in this instance estimated at \u00a310. 8s. 6d. annual value, and the Jurors gave account also of Tenures at Lee Brockhurst and Cantlop, and 17 Rot.

In 1292, she was sued for estovers in Pichford Wood, by Richard de Eton,2* and at the same time, under designation of \" Margaret de Albrygton,\" was reported by the Brimstree Jurors to hold \u00a37. of lands in Albrygton of the King in capite, and to be, as to any second marriage, at the King's disposal.25 In 1304, Margaret de Picheford complained to the King of having suffered a redisseizin at the hands of Roger Carles and William the Beadle of Brimstree, from whom, in the King's Court at Bruges, she had recovered seizin of eleven merks annual rent in Albrighton. The usual writ to the Sheriff issued accordingly, viz. to examine into the truth of the complaint, and if it were well grounded, to arrest the Defendants.26 I must now speak of Ralph de Pichford, son and heir of John, as of the last of his line who had any interest in Albrighton. In 1292, he was reported by the Brimstree Jurors as holding a Knight's Fee, being of full age, and yet not a Knight, whereupon he was put down as in misericordid. He was also a Defaulter in due atten dance at the Assizes then held ; but his right of assizing bread and beer, and of holding a Market and Fair at Albrighton being called in question, he came forward and pleaded the Charter of King Henry III, which granted the said market and Fair to Ralph, his Ancestor. He also submitted that the other privileges in question were appurtenant to those thus granted. Both pleas seem to have been admitted by the Court.27 On May 31, 1295, styling himself Lord of Albrighton, this Ralph grants to WiUiam de Parco de Ettingestal, two Burgages in the town of Albrighton, which he (Ralph) had of the Escheat of Ysabel le Persone of Albrighton. \u2014 To hold with right of common pasture, at a rent of one rose, payable on the feast of St. John Baptist's Nativity.28 Pursuant to the King's Writ, dated at Portsmouth May 27, 1297, 23 Inquisitions, 13 Edw.

Within three years of this time he sold his Manor of Albrighton to John, Baron Tregoz of Ewyas Harold (Heref) ; and the latter dying on August 21, 1300, was found by Inquisition to have been fully seized thereof.30 John de Tregoz had had two daughters, Clarice and Sibil. Clarice the elder, having been wife of Roger de la Warre and Mother of John de la Warre, was at this time deceased : Sibil the younger was still living and the wife of Sir WiUiam Grandison. John de la Warre and the said Sibil were therefore found to be Coheirs of Sir John Tregoz. A suit arose between them as to partition of his Estates, which was finally settled in 1302, by award of Parliament.31 Thus did the Manor of Albrighton faU to the estate of John de la Warre. In the year 1303, John de la Warre memorialized King Edward I, as to certain privileges which he claimed by prescription in this Manor, viz. View of Frank-pledge, a market every Tuesday, and a Fair of four days' duration (the vigil, the day of, and the two days succeeding the Feast of the Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr, i. e. July 6, 7, 8, and 9, in each year) . The King issued a writ of Certiorari to the Sheriff, who, after assembling a Jury at Donington, on June 25, reported that Ralph de Pichford, who sold the Manor to Sir John Tregoz, had the said right of Market, and a right of Fair for three days, also View of Frank-pledge twice in the year over his own Burgesses, but not over the other Tenants of the Manor, \u2014 that the said Ralph exercised these privileges all the time while he was Lord, and that so his Ancestors had done from time whereof memory was not.32 In conformity with this report, the King's Charter issued in the same year, limiting the Fair to the 6th, 7th, and 8th days of Julv and fixing that two Courts for the View of Frank-pledge should be held in the Quinzaines of Easter and Michaelmas annually.33 The Feodary of 1316, duly returns Johu de la Ware as Lord of 29 Parliamentary Writs, i, 291. 30 Inquisitions, 28 Edward I, No. 43.

Jan. 1270, Nicholas Kareles and Burgia his wife and Ranulf de Albryton and AUce his wife sold land in Donington to Hugh de Beaumes. Sept. 1272, at Salop Assizes, Nicholas Careles was a Juror for Brimstree Hundred. He occurs also on Juries of April 16, 1273, and April 25, 1285, at Astley-Abbots and Pichford.

The latter sale had for some cause or other to be confirmed by Fine, and that Fine was levied by special order of the King.41 It bears date at York on the quinzaine of St. Hilary (Jan. 27) 1301, and purports to be between the Bishop as Plaintiff (querentem), and Ralph de Picheford, Defendant (impedientem), of two acres of land in Albrighton, and the Advowson of the Church, whereof was a plea of warranty of charter. Ralph acknowledged the Bishop's right as of his own (Ralph's) gift,- \u2014 to hold of the Chief Lords of the Fee. For this the Bishop gave one hundred merks ; but an Indorsement on the Fine states that William de Grandisone with Sibil his wife and John de la Ware put in their claim.42 Bishop Langton's object in this and other purchases in Shropshire shall be spoken of elsewhere. \u2014 The troubles which beset him about this time were probably 38 Originalia, i, 250. that they disputed the right of sale, as Joint Lords of the Fee, pending the par tition of Tregoz' lands, and that they had an interest in the matter.

This time was extended in certain cases ; but, in general, a Fine which had stood for five years without question barred all subsequent claim. 39 Supra, p. 112, note. 40 Pope Nich.

He retained the Advowson of Albrighton for a very short period, and Sir John de la Warre presented to thc Church in 1307. On Dec. 10th, 1326, an Inquest was ordered to ascertain if it would be to the loss of the Crown, should the King allow John de la Warre to grant an acre of land in Albriton and the Advowson of the Church to the Abbot and Convent of Dore, \u2014 the said Convent to provide three Monks as Chaplains to do daily service in the Church of Dore Abbey for the soul of said John and his Ancestors. A Jury which sat at Claverley on Jan. 3, 1327, reported that the proposed grant would not injure the Crown; that John de la Warre held the Manor of Albrighton in capite by one Knight's fee ; that the Church was worth .\u20ac20. per annum, that the said John had various other estates, such as the Castle of Ewias Harald, the Manor of Manchester worth \u00a3200. a year, &c. &c, in Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, and Northamptonshire.*3 On May 2, 1332, a King's Writ orders a Jury to inquire whether it would be to the King's injury if Roger Careles had license to grant a messuage, sixty acres of land, and 20s. annual rent in Albrighton to a Chaplain, who should perform daily service in honour of the Blessed Virgin, and for the souls of said Roger and all the faithful departed, at the Altar of the same Virgin in the Church of St. Mary at Albrighton. The Jury which sat at Shrewsbury on June 10 fbUowing, re ported favourably of the proposed grant ; that the land, &c, were held of John le Wares, Lord of Albrighton, by annual service of a rose; that the whole was worth 33s. id. per annum; that a messutige, two carucates of land and certain rents would remain to Roger in Albrighton and Ritton (Ryton) after the proposed Conveyance ; that these last premises were held of John de la Ware by service of 6s. annually, and that they were amply sufficient to discharge all customs and services due thereon.** In 1341, the Church of Albrighton stood at the old Taxation of eight merks (\u00a35. 6s. 8d.), but the Parish was assessed only at five merks, for the Ninth of its Corn, Wool, and Lamb. The reasons of the difference were, because the Abbot of Buildwas had three carucates of land in the Parish on which he did not pay corn-tithe, but 10s. in lieu thereof; also because the glebe, offerings, small 43 Inquisitions, 20 Edward II, No. I 42, | 44 Inquisitions, 6 Edw.

It does not appear at first why the Abbot's Modus in lieu of corn-tithe was an argu ment in diminution of the Ninth, which was a tax upon corn specifically, and which proposed to consider the tenth of corn usually paid by a Parish to the Church as an equivalent to the ninth of corn now to be paid to the Ring. Con sequently if the Abbot paid 10s. per annum to the Rectors of Albrighton he should now pay apparently 10s. or (if his modus were a beneficial one) even a greater sum to the ninth. Perhaps however the truth of the matter is that the Assessors of the ninth meant to except the Abbot's lands and modus altogether. He was not assessed to the Tax in some other instances. The Abbot of Buildwas' land in the Parish was Cosford Grange. 46 Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 186, 33. 47 Lichfield Register (Langton), folios 18, 27 b, 28 b, 29. 48 Patent, 12 Edw. II, p. 1, memb. 2.

This probably was the same with Robert de Arden, Priest, who, on July 12, 1323, exchanged this preferment for that of \u2014 Philip de Warle, Deacon, late Rector of Clopton (Lincoln Diocese) . The latter was instituted here on presentation of Sir John le Ware, Knight. On Aug. 17, 1323, he had license for a year's non-residence, and again on July 2, 1325; and for two years on Aug. 29, 1328, being in each instance styled Rector of the Church of Albrighton. John de Aston, Chaplain, was admitted to the Vicarage of the Church of Albrighton \" newly founded\" 49 on the 18th Dec. 1329, at presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Dore.

Reginald de Chetwynd seems to have been the next Vicar, for on January 27, in the 31st year of Bishop Roger de Northburg (i.e. 1353), that Prelate appoints William, Rector of Ryton, to be Coadjutor to the said Reginald who was \" worn out with old age and infirmity.\" Sir Reginald de Chetwynd having however spon taneously resigned in the same year : \u2014 Henry, son of William le Smyth of Albryton, Priest, was admitted on Oct. 17, at presentation of the Cistercian Abbey of St. Mary of Dore.50 ARCHITECTURAL AND MONUMENTAL REMAINS.

During some recent and very extensive alterations of this Church, it became necessary to reduce the floor of the South Aisle to what would appear to have been its original level. In removing the soil an Altar-Tomb was discovered, lying buried about eighteen inches below the surface. It has been carefully preserved, and placed outside the Church in a situation approximating to its former one. It is of Stone, and embellished with numerous Coats of Arms, the bearings on all of which can be satisfactorily made out. This Tomb will have been thus unceremoniously buried more than two Centuries since ; for neither Sandford, in his Church-Notes of 1660, nor Johnson, in 1699, make any mention of it, whereas the latter gives very full particulars of another and in may respects very simfiar Tomb at Albrighton. This last was of Marble and is nowhere to be found, whilst the dishonour shown to the buried Tomb has resulted in its preservation; for it is constructed of not very durable stone, and is at the same time very ancient. The Arcade running round its four sides proves its original position to have been isolated from any wall or Niche. The PUlars and Arches which form this Arcade belong to the \"Early- English \" period of Architecture and to the thirteenth Century. \u2014 Altar-Tombs of that date, in memory of private persons, are by no means common.

It was attached to some Episcopal See probably that of Lichfield, but at a period anterior to any existing Record. Domesday shows us that Bispetone was in lay hands in the time of the Confessor. Its separation from the Church was therefore no matter of Norman Sacrilege. In 1085, Normannus (Venator) held Bispetone (of Earl Roger), Turgod had held it and was a free man. Here was i hide geldable. There was (arable) land for vi ox-teams. Here two French men with mi villains and n Boors had m such teams. Here was a wood which would fatten x swine. In time of King Edward, the Manor had been worth 30s., at Domesday it was worth 10*. (per annum).1 Bishton followed the usual descent of Norman Venator's Manors, that is, it went to De Picheford ; but being so near their growing town of Albrighton it graduaUy lost the distinct status which it had at Domesday and became a mere member of the greater Manor. The Tenants who held Bishopston under the Lords of Albrighton took name from the place. The earliest of whom I find mention, was Henry de Bispeston who will be noticed under Donington, as Surety for Leticia de Humfreston in 1221. 84 This coat is ascribed to Cantdupe, as well as the same with the Leopards' heads inverted. 1 Domesday, so. 59, a. 2."], [671, "ETONE 167 Robert and Henry de Bispeston were Jurors, 20 April, 1253, on the Inquest as to the estate of Ralph de Pichford; and in January 1256, were Jurors for Brimstree Hundred at the County Assizes. In September 1272, John de Bisopeston acted in the same capacity. Soon afterwards, in a grant made to Lilleshall Abbey by Hugh de Bolingale, the homages and services of Robert de Bispeston and John his Brother were included.2 On May 9, 1283, a Fine was levied at Salop, between John, son of Henry de Bisshopeston, complainant, and Robert, son of Henry de Bisshopeston, defendant (impedientem), of two messuages and one virgate in Bisshopeston, whereof was Plea. Robert acknow ledged the right of John as of his (Robert's) gift \u2014 to hold of the Chief Lords by accustomed service. John gave for this Fine one sore sparrow-hawk.3 In October 1292, John Fitz Henry de Bispeston was on the Brimstree Jury at Salop Assizes. He occurs in May 1295, as a witness with John, Clerk of Bispeston, and in June 1300, as a Juror with John Fitz Robert of Bispeston. The latter is on a Jury of May 1304, and John Fitz Henry with Peter de Bispeston were fellow Jurors in June 1305, at the Inquest as to the estate of Hugh de Beaumes. Feb. 10, 1306, John de Aula de Bispeston and Peter de Bispeston were Jurors on an Inquest at Claverley; and in May following, John Robert (i.e. Fitz Robert) de Bispeston was on an Inquest at Brug. Somewhat later than this John de Aula attests a deed which wiU be quoted under Donington. \u20actont. There was either some uncertainty about the Tenure of this Manor, which led to its being mentioned twice over in Domesday, or else being then a Manor of one hide it was divided into two equal portions. The two entries which describe it are as follows. \u2014 \" The same Gerard (de Tornai) holds Etone and WiUiam (holds 3 Pe des Finium, 11 Edw. I, Salop. 2 Pat. 18 Ric. II, p. 1, memb. 7."], [672, "168 ETONE it) of him. Turgod held it (in time of King Edward) and was a free man. Here is half-a-hide, geldable. The (arable) land is sufficient for in ox-teams. In demesne, there is i (team) and i serf and mi boors; also, there is i Guest (hospes) paying arent of two shillings. In time of King Edward its value was xn shiUmgs : now it is xi shillings. He (Gerard) found it waste.\"1 \"The same Rainald (Vicecomes) holds in Etone half a hide. Turgot held it for a single Manor and paid geld.\"2 The latter entry is obviously incomplete, and if not erroneous, it exhibits Rainald's Tenure only as partial or involved. Wherever Rainald the Sheriff had a Domesday interest we usually find such interest subsequently represented by Fitz Alan. In the present instance I search for such a correspondence in vain. Nothing held by Fitz Alan in the later Hundreds of Stottesden, Munslow, or Brimstree is found to square with Rainald's interest in the Alnodestreu Manor of Etone. Leaving this difficulty, and looking solely at the mention of Etone as a member of Gerard de Tornai's Fief, its identity with the modern township of Hatton wiU be apparent after a very few remarks. First as to the name ; \u2014this Hatton as well as other places (so called now) are usually found to have been written Hettune or Hetune in older documents. The use or omission of the aspirate was also a matter of caprice. Its omission in Domesday is noticeable in the words now pronounced Hodnet, Hawkesley, and Hopton, which are represented in that record as Odenet, Avochelie, and Opetune. Again, Turgod, Saxon Lord of Etone, also held in time of King Edward, the Manors of Cosford and Bishton, one of which adjoins and the other is near to Hatton. Further, we observe that nearly all the escheated Manors of Gerard de Tornai became tenures in capite by Serjeantry, and some of them by Serjeantry of Castle-guard at Shrawardine. The latter was specifically the case with Hatton. Lastly, Hatton is subsequently found to be a Manor of i hide, a measurement which will combine the contents of the two Domesday Manors of Etone. I can therefore continue my account of the latter no otherwise than under the name of Hatton, \u2014 1 Domesday, so. 259, a. 1. 3 Domesday, so. 255, a. 2."], [673, "169 f^attam The first Document which I have to quote with reference to this Manor is a Deed which on the whole, and notwithstanding some appearances to the contrary, impresses me with an idea of very high antiquity, \u2014 as high as the reign of Henry I or Stephen, 1100-1154. Its substance is as follows : \u2014 Adam Traynel of Hetton grants to Ivo his Nephew (Nepoti) his Manor of Ivelith, as well in Ivelith as in Hynynton, in the County of Salopsire, also common-right of pasture in his (Adam's) land of Hetton; \u2014 to have and to hold, &c. in fee;\u2014 rendering a Red-Rose yearly at the Nativity of John the Baptist. \u2014 Witnesses: William de Beaumeis, Walter Fitz Warin, Robert de Cadeleg, Ralph de Pich ford, Richard Wudecote, John de Sahebury, Henry de Bolynghale, William de Creswell, and many others.1 This Adam Treynel was, I suppose, identical with Adam de Hetune, one of the earliest benefactors to Buildwas Abbey. Within fifty years of its foundation, he granted to that house with concur rence of Reginald his Son, a moiety of the vill of Hettune, which grant was afterwards confirmed by King Richard I in his general Charter to Buildwas, dated at Winchester, 22d October 1189.2 The original Manor of Hatton seems to have been divided into two equal portions by a small stream called Tuy-brook, the course of which may still be traced through a series of artificial pools. The moiety of Hatton which Adam Traynel granted to Buildwas lay to the East of this stream, and was therefore contiguous to those other early acquisitions which the Abbey made at Ruckley and Cosford. 1 This Charter is among the Rawhnson MSS. in the Bodleian Library. Having never seen more than three or four ma norial deeds of this early date, I have little wherewith to compare the one under notice. \u2014 It is on an unusually large scale, both as regards the parchment, the hand writing, and the seal. The latter is completely defaced. The objection to its extreme antiquity, as assigned in the text, is that it has the formulas \"Habendum et Tenendum,\" and \"HiisTestibus,\" usually taken to indicate a date no earlier than the reign of Richard I. There were a Wilham de Beaumeis, aWalterEitz Warin, and a Ralph de Pichford in Henry Ill's time, and each of them likely to attest a deed concerning lands in this quarter, though I should not expect their names to occur in the order indicated above. There were also persons bearing each of these three names in time of Henry I. They were all similarly likely to attest such a deed as this. As far as I can judge, the names of the other witnesses belong to a period anterior to the reign of Richard I. 2 Monasticon, v, 359, No. xvi."], [674, "170 HATTON. The Monks were ever most assiduous in extending their pos sessions here. During the reign of Richard I, as I conclude, they obtained a grant from John de Hemes of a virgate and twelve acres of his demesne in Hettun. This was clearly a part of that moiety which lay to the west of Tuy-brook, and which John de Hemes held under Traynel. This second acquisition was followed by a third not later than the year 1202, and of which we have full particulars \u2014 Walter, Son of John de Hemes, with assent of his Mother, his heir and his friends, grants and confirms to the Abbey of Buldewas in perpetual almoign all that land of Hettun, viz. a virgate and twelve acres, which his Father gave of his demesne. He adds to the gift \" all the land which is between the road of Hyvelith (Evelith) and Tuibroc, which was formerly heath, and four meadows which pertain thereto.\" This latter land the Monks were to hold of Walter by an annual rent of 12d. payable to him and his heirs, and by dis- charging a further annual rent of 5s. which was due to the Grantor's Chief Lord, \u2014 Robert Trainel. The Monks were also to satisfy all foreign service due on half-a-virgate of said land, but the rest was to continue free, as of demesne. For this grant the Monks received the Grantor, his Mother, and his Heirs into their fraternity. \u2014 Witnesses : John le Strange, Hugh de Pichford, Reginald de Tirne, Wido de Saweburi, Hamo Fitz Marscot, Richard de Ruiton, Nicholas de Bolinchale, WilUam Crasset, Baldwin de Hinetun, and John his Son, Peter de Hales, Hugh de Becchebur, Reginald le Budel of Ruiton.3 Robert Trainel mentioned in the above deed as Lord of Hatton, must be taken as a Successor of Adam Trainel and Reginald his Son, but by what relationship I cannot determine. At the Assizes of Oct. 1203, he appears as Essoigner of Adam de Hereford, a non-attendant at the Common Summons, and of whom we have heard before.4 The Tenure by which the Trainels held Hatton was Petit Ser jeantry, of which we now first begin to have some evidence.

And soon after this, Robert Trainel died, for I find that about March 1205, WUliam TramneU gave the King fifteen merks to have custody of the lands and heir of the said Robert till the said heir should be of age. Mandate accordingly issued to the Sheriff of Salop.6 WiUiam Trainel seems to have been a Lawyer. He had already appeared in 1199 and 1200 in the Courts of Westminster as Essoigner of several parties to Shropshire Law-suits. He paid his fine of fifteen merks by instalments in 1205, 1206, and 1207. Nevertheless, about March 1210, he seems to have lost this wardship, though the heir was still a Minor. The lists of Shropshire Serjeantries, about 121 1,7 teUs us that Robert de Tremeill (the said heir) was then in custody of the King; that his Tenure was Hatton, on which the Sheriff was accountable, at the Exchequer, for 40s. per annum. In perfect conformity with this return I find that at Michaelmas 1212, the Sheriff accounted 100s. at the Exchequer \"for two-and a-half years ferm of Robert Trainel' s Hatton,\" and that at Michaelmas 1214, he accounted _\u00a34. on the same, viz. the ferm of two years more.8 This ferm of 40s. per annum was the exact income of Robert Trainel's land, for, as will presently appear, he had previously to his death granted his interest in Hatton to Buildwas Abbey for a term of years, reserving only the said rent. On Jan. 12, 1215, Robert Trainel (the younger) was of age, and fined \" 50s. for his Relies, and to have receipt of 40s. rent, which the Monks of Buildwas were to pay the said Robert for the term during which R.

In 1219, they are paying the Lord of Ideshale a rent of 3s. per annum for common-pasture in Ideshale.11 In 1227, among Tenures in Brimstree Hundred we read that Robert Traynel holds half-a-hide in Henton (Hatton) by Serjeantry of finding one serving foot-soldier at Shrewrthin, at his own cost, for fifteen days, if need shall be, and that the Tenure is worth 40s. per annum.12 We now come to the transaction by which the Monks of Build was at length obtained full possession of that moiety of Hatton of which they had been previously Lessees, and so became Lords of the undivided Manor. \u2014 Robert, son of Robert Traynel of Hattone, for the health of his soul, granted to the Monks in frank ahnoigne, all the land, and wood, and heath, and moor, which he had, as well in demesne as in seigneury (in servicio) in a moiety of the vill of Hattone, viz. whatever lay \" between the rivulet of Tuybroc as it descends into the stream of Worth (Worf) on one side, and the boundary fences of Hynetone (Hinnington) and of Grenhull (Grindle) on the other side, down to the aforesaid stream of Worth.\" He also conceded to the same Monks the other moiety of the vill of Hattone which they already had, by gift of Adam Traynell of Hattone.13 This Deed probably passed about 1248, and about 1251 an Inquest of Tenures found the Abbot of Buldewas holding two carucates of land in Solde-hatton of the gift of Robert Traynel who used to hold that vill of the King in capite}4. In 1252, Nicholas, Abbot of Buildwas, withdrew1 the suit of Hatton from the Hundred of Brimstree, a further proof, not only of his seigneury there, but of the Manor being independent of any other.

Donington and Tong (also a demesne Manor) stood at the convergence of three Domesday Hundreds, viz, Alnodestreu (which contained Albrighton), Bascherch (which contained Cosford and Idshall), and Recordine (which came up to Lilleshall). The Hundred of Idshall and Cosford was however determined by a peculiarity of tenure which did not extend to Donington and Tong; and whereas no Recordine Manors are known to have become Brimstree Manors, it follows, I think, from this, and from their proximity to Albrighton, that Donington and Tong were both in Alnodestreu Hundred. Donington and long; and whereas no Recordine Manors are known to have become Brimstree Manors, it follows, I think, from this, and from their proximity to Albrighton, that Donington and Tong were both in Alnodestreu Hundred. After the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, the Seigneury of this Manor passed by grant of the Crown to Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, of whom and his Successors, Lords of Donington and Tong, I propose to give a fuller account under the latter Manor. 1 Domesday, so. 253, b. 2. There is one clause in this entry which requires special notice, viz. \"In Wich v salin\u00e6 reddnnt xx solidos.\" \u2014 The Domesday Annotators have left us to suppose that where Salin\u00e6 (salt-works or salt-pans) are mentioned in connexion with any Manor, some local advantage is indicated, e. g. that a salt-spring or the sea-coast was near at hand. It is further ascertained that Wich was a generic term applicable to any place where salt was produced. No etymological connexion has, I think, been established between the word Wich and salt; but I need only mention Droitwich in Worcestershire, and Nantwich, Nort.hwich, and Middlewieh in Cheshire, as a few instances of the rela- tionship. Are we then to conclude that in 1085 the Manor of Donington contained within its limits a district called Wich, wherein were five salt-works ? I suppose it just as probable that it contained five miles of sea-coast, where marine salt was manu faetured. The truth, I imagine, is that five Salina in Wich, that is in one of the large salt districts of Cheshire or Worcestershire, were adjuncts of this Manor, and had been so in Saxon times. Earl Edwin, the Saxon Lord of Do nington, was, next to King Edward the Confessor, the principal owner of the Wiches of Cheshire and Worcestershire. So much for the state of things at and before the time of Domesday.\u2014In the next century (the twelfth) we find Barons, Abbots, and Priors, whose territories lay mainly in Shropshire, holding or trans fering shares in the salt-works of both Cheshire and Worcestershire.

Here we will speak of that collateral race of De Belmeis, whose Ancestor having been enfeoffed in Donington held the same under the elder house and transmitted it, so held, to some generations of his heirs. Without attempting to decide who that William de Beaumeis was who stands first witness of the deed with which I have com menced my account of Hatton,2 I proceed to Richard de Beaumeis undoubtedly living in the time of Henry II, holding Donington under the Lords of Tong, and perhaps having an interest at Meadowley by a simUar title. Philip de Belmeis, Lord of Tong, and Cousin as I suppose of this Richard, made, about the year 1139, a grant to the then recently founded Abbey of Buildwas. This grant, besides other advantages, included Ruckley then a member of Tong. Philip's example was in due time foUowed by his relation and vassal Richard, who (as I understand his deed) granted to the same Monks now established in their Grange of Ruckley, a right of com mon-pasture throughout his land (of Donington), and three acres of land whereunto they might attach a bridge, which must needs be made across the stream which ran between Ruckley and Don ington before such common -right could be available.3 Between the years 1152 and 1159, Richard de Belmeys, as a 3 Supra, page 169.

In 1157, this Richard de Bealmes is mentioned as having fined ten merks with the King to have some trial (loquela) against Alan de Uppedun. This fine is entered as an arrear till 1160, when the King's writ had ordered it to be excused, calling it a fine for a plea of seizin? In 1167, Richard de Bealmes' (Manor of) Dunnincton is entered as having been amerced half-a-merk in a recent iter of the Justice of the Forest.6 At Michaelmas 1189, Aaron, a very wealthy Jew of Lincoln, having died, his chattels and securities escheated to the Crown. Richard de Beumes had owed him \u00a3i. 8s. 6d. which he pays through the Sheriff of Shropshire by successive instalments, the last of which is entered on the Pipe-Roll of 1200.6 All that I can further say of Richard de Belmeis is, that he appears to have granted a subinfeudation of Shakerley a member of Donington, to Robert, Uncle of Robert de Wodecote.7 It is more than probable that the several notices above given as attaching to the name of Richard de Belmeis indicate a succession of two persons of the same name, probably Father and Son. I doubt not however that, if this were so, both were Lords of Donington. From 1185 to 1203, we have occasional notices of one Robert de Belmeis who I believe to have been representative of another branch of the family, and to have had feoffment in Tong and elsewhere. Of him and his very uncertain succession, I wUl say more when I come to that Manor. The next Lord of Donington whom I can discover after Richard de Belmeis was Walter de Belmeis. He first appears in November 1221, as having been challenged by Geoffrey de Eswell for breach of the King's peace and for robbery. His accuser, though bound over to prosecute, did not appear before the Justices in Eyre, and so was to be arrested, the Jury meantime acquitting the accused.8 4 Rot Pip. 3, 4, 5 & 6 Hen. II, Salop. I doubt not that the suit referred to some disputed land at Meadowley, where Alan de Upton (mentioned Vol. I, page 140.) will have been the Defendant, and where I have shown Richard de Belmeis to have been probably interested in 1180 (Vol. I, 6 Rot.

About this time, and followed by Philip de Beaumes, he attests a Charter of Roger la Zouch, Lord of Tong, to Buildwas Abbey. He has already occurred as a prominent witness to a Badger Deed which passed about 1227. About 1240, he is entered, on a RoU of Tenures, as holding a knight's fee in Doninton of the Barony of Herbert Fitz Peter.9 Here, though the Tenant's name be stated correctly enough, it is probable that the Seigneury is altogether misrepresented. In 1255, Walter de Belmeis was deceased, and, as I have pointed out under Meadowley, Roger de Belmeis, who was his son, had succeeded him. At the Assizes of January 1256, I find Johanna, widow of Walter de Beaumeis, suing several under-tenants in Donington for her dower. \u2014 Her suit against Ranulph, son of Richard Russell, for thirds in four acres of land and two of meadow, was adjourned to one month of Easter, the Defendant calling Roger de Beaumes to warranty. \u2014 Her suit against the same for thirds in three acres of land and five of meadow, was adjourned till the Quinzaine of Easter ; and the land meanwhUe was seized by the Crown because the Defendant did not appear. \u2014 Her suit against the Prioress of Brewood for a third part of 100 acres, and that against Roger de Pyweledon for a third of five acres of meadow, were met by both Defendants calling Roger de Beaumes to warranty, Roger de Pyweledon only claiming a terminal interest under demise of Walter de Beaumes. 9 Testa de Nevill, p. 46. Donington was at this time held immediately of Alan la Zouche and of the Honour of Tong. So far, therefore, this entry is not strictly correct. Neither can I suppose it true that Alan la Zouche held Tong of the Barony of Herbert Fitz Peter. I can account for the mistake only in one way. The Fitz Herberts had profited largely by the forfeiture of WUliam de Braose in King John's reign, and were subsequently sharers in his inheritance. Moreover, William de Braose had had in 1204 some Seignoral Interest over Tong. During the temporary forfeiture of Roger la Zouch, this Seignoral Interest had further gained for Braose the actual possession of Tong as of an Escheat. His rights, therefore, may have inadvertently been taken to have descended to Herbert Fitz Peter, whereas the Tenant-right had been re stored to La Zouche, and the Seigneural right (whatever it was) seems to have gone with the bulk of the Honour of Brecknock to the Earls of Hereford. How Braose originally acquired a seig neury in the Honour of Tong I have not the remotest conception."], [682, "178 DONINGTON. Roger de Beaumes appeared in these cases and vouched each warranty, so that the Defendants were dismissed sine die, and Johanna adjudged to have equivalents out of other lands of Roger de Beaumes.10 At the same Assizes, Roger de Beaumes, being impleaded by the Prioress of the White Nuns of Brewood in regard to her right to have estovers in Doninton Wood, came to an agreement on the subject.11 In this year also, Roger de Beaumes was returned by the Sheriff as one of those who, holding i_15. of lands, was yet not a Knight.13 In 1258, he fined half-a-merk of gold (equal to five merks of silver) to have respite in this matter, and the said fine was still in arrear at Michaelmas 1259.13 All that I can further say of this Roger is contained in a deed whereby WUliam, sou of Walter Spink, of Culeshal (Kilsall) quits to Roger, son of Walter de Beaumes, aU his right in the land which said Walter Spink held under the Ancestors of said Roger, with a messuage, curtilage, and other appurtenances, within and without the vill of Doniton. \u2014 Witnesses : Peter Giffard, Hugh de Hadinton, Hugh de Bolinchal, John de Pres, Michael de Morton, Stephen Parker (Parcarius), Robert de Picstoc, John Fitz Pagan, Ranulph the Forester, and others.14 A period of at least ten years now elapses, during which I find neither deed nor Record to throw any light on this succession. In 1270, however, John de Belmeis was suing the Master of the Knights Templars under writ of Novel Disseizin for a Knight's Fee in Medweleye (Meadowley),15 and he must have been of the Donington branch. There was also one Alan de Beaumes whom the Brimstree Jurors presented, at the Assizes of 1272, as not guilty of Larceny. John de Beaumes again occurs in 1284 as holding the Manor of Doninton with Culeshall (Kilsall) and Shakerlawe (Shakerley) , under Roger la Zouch, by one Knight's Fee. This John de Beaumes bought the Manor of Stanwey from his contemporary Hugh de Beaumes, who also had an interest in Tong and Donington.16 At the Assizes of October 1292, both John and Hugh officiated 10 Salop Assizes, 40 Hen.

A writ of King Edward I, dated May 1, 1304, directs an Inquest to be held to ascertain whether it would injure the King if he allowed John de Beaumeys to grant ten acres of land and ten acres of wood in Donyton to the Prioress of the White Nuns of Brewode; The Inquest, which was taken at Salop on May 14 following, reported in favour of the grant, adding that the land in question was held of Alan la Zouche by military service, \" for that John held the Manor by half a Knight's Fee under said Alan, and therein were three carucates of land, 300 acres of wood, twenty acres of meadow, and five merks of annual rent over and above the twenty acres proposed to be alienated, which twenty acres were worth 3s. id. per annum.\" w June 12, 1305, John de Beaumes was still firing, for the Inquest then taken on the death of his contemporary, Hugh de Beaumes, shows the latter to have held a messuage, &c. in John's Lordship of Donington.19 And within ten years of the last date, John de Beaumes was deceased, leaving two sons Hugh and John, the latter of whom, being the younger, and having some interest in both Donington and Stanwey by disposition of his Father, resigned the same to his elder Brother.

The Jurors sat at Donynton on 28th July, and reported that the grant would be harmless ; that the wood was held of William de Mortimer Lord of Ashby la Zouche, with other lands in Donynton, by service of half a Knight's Fee ; that the thirty acres were worth 5s. per annum ; that the said WiUiam de Mortimer and the Earl of Hereford were mediate between Hugh de Beaumes and the King.22 In 1316, Hugh de Beaumeys was duly returned as Lord of the Manor of Donnington.23 On April 22, 1324, styling himself Lord of Donynton, he grants to John de Beames his Brother, a messuage in Shakerlew, which John atte Syche held, and two parcels of adjacent land in addition, with two pieces of waste in Donynton Wood, &c., to hold to John and his heirs lawfully begotten, at a rent of 8s. payable to the Grantor and Helena his wife and the Grantor's heirs, for all services except heriots and suit of the Grantor's Court of Donynton. He also grants wood for fire and fence, and the accustomed rights of common for all the Grantee's own stock and for 240 sheep of other persons.

We must therefore ascribe this Foundation to Earl Roger de Mont gomery whom we know to have bestowed the Advowson thereof on Shrewsbury Abbey.29 Donington Church wiU therefore have been built, endowed, and thus disposed of, within eight years of Domesday, for Earl Roger died in July 1094, if not a year earlier. 36 Salop Assizes, 5 John, m. 6 dorso. 27 Salop Assizea,GE.en.

This grant to Shrewsbury Abbey received specific confirmation from King William (probably Rufus), Henry I, Stephen, Henry II, and Henry III, in their various Charters to that House. The Monks of Shrewsbury were induced to consign this Advowson to Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, who, as Lord of the Manor, will have had special reasons for such an arrangement. The last moments of that great Statesman, when he lay dying at the Priory of St. Osyth, were devoted to certain formal acts of restitution, suggested either by some previous injustice of his own, or some doubt as to the honorable incUnations of his heir. His letter on the subject of his interest in Donington Church belongs undoubtedly to this period of his life, and was suggested by some such feeling. It is as follows, \u2014 \" Richard Bishop of London to aU the Barons of the County of Scropscire greeting. I wiU that ye tender testimony for the Monks of St. Peter, that Roger the Earl gave them the Church of Doninton before that I obtained the vill ; and I do have the same Church from them, not as a gift, but as a trust (non donatam sed pr\u00e6stitam) as long as they may will. Farewell.\"30 Thus in January 1127, will the Monks of Shrewsbury have obtained a second title-deed to the Advowson of Donington. I should have observed that Earl Roger's grant of Churches to Shrewsbury Abbey was accompanied by a right of appropriation, subject only to the lives of existing Incumbents. Such a right must have been from the first exercised under Episcopal sanction. In the case of Donington it was commuted at a very early period for an annual pension of half-a-merk (6s. 8d.), payable by the Incumbent to the Abbey. These rights of Advowson and Pension generally were confirmed to the Abbey by Charters of Roger de Clinton,31 Walter Durdent,33 and other succeeding Bishops of Chester, Coventry, or Lichfield ; the specific pension of half-a-merk, I also find authorized in a Charter of Richard Peche,33 Bishop of Lichfield from 1 161 to 1182.

The reasons why it was assessed so low, were because a thirtieth of wheat was payable as tithe of one carucate held by the Abbot of Buildwas, and because another carucate held by the same Abbot lay unfilled ; also because the Prioress of the Nuns of Brewod had three caru cates of land in the Parish and paid tenths thereon to the Pope, and because the glebe, small tithes, the mill, and other spiritualities went to swell the greater sum (the Taxation) and did not affect the ninth conceded to the King.35 In 1534, the Rectory of Donyngton (of which Richard Hill was Incumbent) was of \u00a314. gross annual value, which was chargeable with 13s. id. for Synodals and Procurations. \u2014 The Abbot of Shrewsbury still continued to receive a pension of 6s. 8d. therefrom.36 EARLY INCUMBENTS. The earliest of these, of whom I have any notice, was a victim of the times in which he lived. \u2014 At the Assizes of January 1256,. the Jurors of Brimstree Hundred reported how Simon, Parson of Dunyton, had been slain by unknown Malefactors, who had also burnt his house, and how the vills of Dunyton, Tonge &c. had made no pursuit after the assassins.37 At this period the murdered man had been succeeded by one named James, for at the same Assizes an issue was tried as to whether \u2014 Ranulph le Forester had unjustly erected a fence in Duniton to the injury of the free tenement of Hugh de Schenton in the same vill.

It contained a spacious wood stiU known as the Bishop's Wood, and which is noticed in Domesday as an adjunct of the Manor.1 But there was a large tract of land hereabouts of which neither the Shropshire nor Staffordshire Domesday takes any notice, but which doubtless formed an exclusive district at the time of the Survey, and was known for more than a Century afterwards as the Royal Forest of Brewood. Its extent may be clearly ascertained. \u2014 Weston and Bishop's Wood mark its Northern boundary ; Brewood and ChUlington its Eastern; Albrighton, Donington, and Tong complete the circle to the South and West. I have before intimated that land exclusively of the Forest does not necessarily claim any notice in Domesday. Here then is an instance of the fact. This district occupied hundreds of acres both in Shropshire and Staffordshire, and the only hint which we have of its existence, or the King's appropriation thereof, is where he is said to have retained in his own hands some, probably adjoining, forest ground in Albrighton.2 No notice has occurred to me of any Royal visit to Brewood or its Forest before the time of King John. That Monarch, whose daily movements for the greater part of his reign are well ascer tained, is found to have been thrice at Brewood, viz. April 4, 1200, January 27-29, 1206, and August 18, 1207.3 Each of these visits 42 Dugdale's Visitation of Shropshire, so. 42. 2 Supra, p. 149. 3 See the \" Itinerary of King John,\" by 1 Domesday, so. 247 a. 1.

Never theless it was King John himself who, by one grant after another, surrendered the more imperative rights of the Crown in regard to this district, so that after his reign we find no mention of Brewood as of a Royal Forest. I wiU quote one or two documents which indicate the progress of this suppression \u2014 On April 10, 1200, King John, after a visit to Brewood, having reached Worcester, addresses a precept to Geoffrey Fitz Piers and Hugh de NeviU (then Chief Justice of England and the Justice of the Forest) prohibiting them from hindering the Bishop of Coventry in inclosing a Park in his wood of Brewude ; for which Park, to be two leagues in circumference, as weU as for fortifying EccleshaU Castle, the said Bishop had the King's License.4 On March 13, 1204, the King being at Bruges issued his Charter to certify that he \" had altogether disforested his Forest of Browud, in aU respects pertaining to a Forest or Foresters. Wherefore the said Forest, and the men who dwelt therein, and their hens, were to be disforested for ever, and quit of the King and his hens, in all those same respects.\" 5 On Feb. 4, 1206, the King informs Hugh de NeviU that he has given the Bishop of Chester \" license to make a decoy (saltorium) in his Park of Briwud towards the Forest ; and Hugh de NevUl is to allow it.\"6 From this it would appear that the former Charter was not yet in full operation ; but the King's retention of his Forest-rights appears more clearly and at a stiU later period. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, the following proceeding was duly registered : \u2014 \" The Knights and men who live in Brewode in Salopesire give the King 100 merks that they and their heirs may be for ever dis forested, according to that which is contained in the King's Charter which they, and the men of Staffordshire, have : \u2014 So that all they of the County of Salopesire who have hunted or taken beasts in Brewode within the County of Salopesir may bear their share of the aforesaid fine, rateably with the said Knights and men, according to their respective interests therein.\"7 At these same Assizes, John Bagot and Hamo de Weston were indicted for receiving Marksmen (Bersatores) and Hounds at 4 Rot.

Blymhill and Weston, but the result of this indictment does not appear.8 I find no later notice of Brewood as a Royal Forest nor of the Crown being seized of any lands in the district. A precept of King John, dated 26th July 1213, allows the Archbishop of Dublin to take thirty stags in Brewud Park ; but this precept is addressed to the Custodes of the (then vacant) See of Coventry, from which I infer that the Bishop's Park was to supply the order.9 CISTERCIAN NUNNERY OF BREWOOD, NOW WHITE-LADIES. The Forest, whose boundaries and history I have been sketching, inclosed at the beginning of the 13th if not at the end of the 12th Century two principal objects of interest, viz. a Convent of Cistercian Nuns, whose house, dedicated to St. Leonard, and still known as White-Ladies, was in Shropshire, and a Convent of Black or Benedictine Nuns, whose house, dedicated to St. Mary, was in Staffordshire.10 So far from constituting one foundation, as these establishments are sometimes taken to have done, they had nothing to connect them but their propinquity, and nothing in common but a spirit of mutual rivalry. It is with the Cistercian and Shropshire House alone that we are concerned, and this is the fittest time to speak of it. \u2014 Though associated with Donington more than any other place,11 the spot still retains some vestiges of its antient status. It is parochiaUy aud manorially independent. Its ruined wall and con secrated precinct are stiU protected and venerated by members of the Faith under which it was founded. Its History, like itself, consists but of fragments, for, however 8 Some words which seem to have stated the illicit objects of the accused are unintelligible. which we treat, the King's Eorest was already nourishing that sapling oak which was destined in its maturity to shelter a King's person. 9 Claus. 15 John, memb. 3. 11 Tanner makes this house to be in Brewood Parish, and so a part of Brewood Parish to be in Shropshire. Neither as sumption is correct. The Nuns were called \" of Brewood,\" not because their house was in Brewood Parish but in Brewood Forest. 10 I may, in a note, anticipate that third and more romantic interest which now attaches to this district. The Royal Eorest of Brewood gave place in course of time to farms and homesteads, one of which, as yet uncleared and unnamed, was afterwards to be known as Boscobel. Perhaps indeed, and at the very time of"], [692, "188 BREWOOD FOREST. interesting to the Antiquary, no Chartulary of this House is known to exist ; we have not even a definite Legend as to its origin.12 We are told, and I believe truly, that it was founded in the time of Richard I, or of John. It certainly was in full existence during the latter reign, for besides the grant in Bridgnorth which King John made to this Sisterhood, and which has been already spoken of,13 his Charter dated September 1, 1212, gives them some immu nities in regard to land at Calvreton (Co. Notts) of which they were previously possessed.14 Their further endowments, as far as Shropshire contributed, will be or have been detailed in different sections of this book, and where other Counties were concerned, must be epitomized in a note.15 I may however here say that all details collectively warrant an idea that the property of this Sisterhood was acquired by gradual and smaU instalments, and that each item represents the consign ment of some female member of a wealthy or powerful family to the service of Religion. No more direct and apparent Patronage of this House can be traced in its scattered history than that of the Diocesan Bishops. No consent of the Crown seems to have been necessary on the election of its successive Prioresses. \u2014 The Sisterhood elected their own Superior and the Bishop con firmed or cancelled their choice. No Seal of the house is known to exist;16 no earlier Charter, 13 Mr. Dukes (Antiquities, p. 201) says indistinctively of these Black and White Nunneries, that \" it is supposed that they were founded by Isabel Launder and Hubert Walter about the year 1195.\" Part of this supposition may rest upon a Legend, and seems to require a passing note. If Hubert Walter ever founded a Nunnery, we know enough of him to declare that it was the Cistercian rather than the Benedictine Order which would have had his patronage. If again he ever founded a Shropshire Nunnery, it will have been at about the time indicated (1195-6) when he was Archbishop of Canterbury, Legate of the See of Rome, Viceroy of King Richard, and somewhat occupied in this County. His authority in Brewood Forest must, however, have existed solely under permission or direction of the King.\u2014 is associated with the Black Nunnery of Brewood, but in a way singularly incon gruous with any concern in its foundation. \u2014 She was its last Prioress, and as such surrendered it to the Commissioners of Henry VIII. 13 Supra, Vol. I, p. 361. 14 Rot.

They are when fouud to be admonished to return within ten days under pain of the Greater Excommunication. All who aid or abet their concealment are threatened with the like penalty.18 A letter, by the same Bishop, as to a recent election of a Prioress of this House, will show the names and rank of some of the Sister hood.19 It bears date at Heywood, May 29, 1332, and recites as follows : \u2014 \" that the Priory of White Nuns of Brewod had recently been vacant by resignation of Dame Joan de Huggeford, the last Prioress; that on the third day of the vacancy the Sub-prioress and Convent met in the Chapter House and agreed to elect a Prioress by method of Scrutiny; whereupon Agnes de Weston (Sub-prioress), Beatrice de Bures, and Joan Giffard were appointed Scrutineers to collect and announce the votes of the Convent ; that they did so ; and that the result was the election of Dame Alice de Harlegh, a Nun of the House.\" The Prioress-elect had apparently offered the usual opposition to her own promotion, and at last given the not less usual consent. The premises had been reported to the Bishop whose ratification was necessary. \u2014 He had ordered due inquiry to be made as to all particulars, and finding the process of election to have been informal, cancels it altogether, deprives the electing body of the power to elect on this occasion, and appropriates the same power to himself. The Bishop then (\" in his own Pontifical Authority\") appoints the same Dame Alice de Harlegh to be Prioress, lest the Convent should suffer harm by a protracted vacancy, and because he has heard of the many virtues by which the said Alice is recommended to the office. \u2014 Sir Richard Morys, Chaplain, has the Bishop's mandate to induct and instal the new Prioress. 19 Ibidem Register, ii, so. 210. 17 Supra, Vol. I, p. 361. 13 Lichfield Register, iii, so. 19. 25 II."], [694, "190 BREWOOD FOREST. Dame Alice de Harley died in 1349, when Beatrice de Dene, Prioress-elect, and her Convent, agreed to submit such election to the order of the same Bishop. The Bishop in a letter dated at Heywod, July 29, 1349, appoints the said Beatrice to be Prioress, and orders the Archdeacon of Stafford to instal her.20 At this period the site and local possessions of the Priory extended to three carucates of land, which, as we have seen under Dcnington, were estimated to be in that Parish. In 27 Henry VIII (1535-6), Dame Margaret, Prioress of this House, returned its gross annual income at \u00a331. Is. id., its out goings at \u00a313. 10s. 8c.., and its net income at \u00a317. 10s. 8d. \u2014 The demesne lands at White Ladies contributed .\u00a36. 13s. id. of the gross income. The balance was made up by rents in Notting hamshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. The latter arose from smaU parcels of land at Higley, Chatwall, Rudge, Bold, Sutton (Maddock), Rowton, High-Ercall, Berrington, Shrewsbury, Bridg north, Ingardine, TedstiU, Beckbury, and Humfreston. The Advowsons of Muntford (Salop) and Tydshull (Derbyshire) also were appropriate to White-Ladies, and a pension from Bold Chapel, already alluded to. \u2014 Among the outgoings of the House was a chief rent of 10s. to the Lord of Donyngton; an annual fee of 16s. 8d. to Thomas Gifforde, Esq. their Seneschal; and a Salary of \u00a35. for the Chaplain, who by appointment of the Nuns performed services within their Monastery for the souls of their Founders.21 The Ministers' Accounts of 28 Henry VIII (1536-7) exhibit the gross income of this House as \u00a335. 3s. 3d. \u2014 a difference arising from the addition of a few items of revenue, the alteration of others, and the valuation of the Demesne-lands and Manor being raised to \u00a310. 9s. 6d?> The Architectural Remains at White-Ladies consist of a Chapel in the Norman style with round Arches.

It was for centuries the abode or heritage of men, great either for their wisdom or their virtues, eminent either from their station or their misfortunes. The retrospect of their annals alternates between the Palace and the Feudal Castle, between the Halls of Westminster and the Council- Chamber of Princes, between the battle-field, the dungeon, and the grave. The History of the Lords of this Manor is in fact the biography of Princes and Prelates, Earls and Barons, Statesmen, Generals, and Jurists. These are the great names and reminiscences with which the place is associated ! \u2014 the Saxon Earls of Mercia, brave, patient, and most unfortunate; \u2014 victims of inexorable progress: then their three Norman successors, one wise and politic, another chivalrous and benevolent, the last madly ambitious and monstrously cruel ; \u2014 then the Majesty of England represented by Henry I, a Prince who, in ability for ruUng, almost equalled his Father, and has been surpas sed by none of his Successors ; \u2014 then the sumptuous and viceregal pride of De Belmeis, Bishop, General, Statesman, and withal very Priest;\u2014 his collateral heirs with their various and wide-spread interests, dim in the distance of time, but traceable to a common origin ; \u2014 the adventurous genius and loyal faith of Brittany represented in La Zouche; tales of the oscillating favouritism 1 Domesday, so. 253, b. 2. n. >. 25 \u00a7"], [700, "192 TONG and murderous treachery of King John; \u2014 overweening ambition and saddest misfortune chronicled in the name of De Braose. \u2014 a Harcourt miscalculating the signs of his time and ruined by the error ; \u2014 a race of Pembruges whose rapid succession tells of youth and hope and the early grave ; \u2014 then the open-handed and magnificent Vernons ; lastly, Stanley, a name truly English, and ever honourable in English ears, yet for one2 of whom it was fated to add a last flower to this ehaplet of ancestral memories, to cut short the associations which five centuries had grouped around this fair inheritance. Such summarily is the history of which I am now to give a few of the earlier details. \u2014 That the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury should retain in demesne the richest Manors of his Saxon Predecessors was an act of compara tive moderation. Tong and Donington were of this class at a period when a fertile, level, and well-watered soil can alone have constituted Manorial value. That the two Manors thus combined were objects of the Earl's special regard we may learn from the only fact which remains to us of his dealings therewith. \u2014 Within ten years after Domesday , he founded a Church in each of them. Churches were at that period so thinly scattered that the necessity of two so near together can have suggested itself only to a mind intent upon the welfare of a certain locality, and the district, thus cared for by the Earl, was doubtless honoured by his frequent presence. \u2014 There were woods wherein he might exercise his favorite diver sion, waters which could supply so devout a Catholic with the proper means of abstinence, to say nothing of the salt-works attached to Donington, \u2014 those essential adjuncts of a great feudal establishment. On the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Belesme, Tong and Donington will have been of the Demesne of King Henry I. How long they continued so, we know not ; we only know the fact, but not the time or particulars, of a grant which that Monarch must have made of both to his Viceroy, Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London. Here then is a fitting opportunity to introduce a notice of this remarkable man whose public career for forty years was more or less associated with Shropshire. 2 Sir Edward Stanley, K.B., Father of tho beautiful, but too famous, Venetia, Lady Digby. She was her Father's Co- heb-, and, had Sir Edward not sold the estate, Tong might have further been asso ciated with the name of Sir Kenelm Digby."], [701, "193 TONG It is intimated, by a respectable authority,3 that Richard de Belmeis was, in the first instance, largely and confidentially employed by Earl Roger de Montgomery. If so, he was doubtless largely rewarded ; but being a Clerk, and his preferment probably Ecclesiastical, we cannot appeal to Domesday for any verification of this statement.4 Nevertheless we find Richard de Belmeis prominent among the great men who attested the Charters of Earl Roger, and a witness also of all the Charters, genuine and doubtful, which are assigned to Earl Hugh, in the Register of Shrewsbury Abbey. His non-participation in the treason of Robert de Belesme is apparent and most probably recommended him to the notice and patronage of Henry I. Here I must again quote the Welsh Chronicle for specific details which can be supplied from no other source, but whose veracity is warranted by a most extraordinary coherence with less relevant documents. \u2014 Three Sons of Blethyn ap Convyn, Prince of Powis, had, in the first instance, allied themselves to Belesme, but the promises of King Henry had subsequently detached Jorwerth, the most influential though not the eldest of the three, from the confederacy. On the fall of Belesme, about August 1102, Jorwerth went to the King's Court to claim his reward, but without success. The King afterwards, probably mistrusting his intentions, invited Jorwerth to a conference at Shrewsbury. Jorwerth came, was accused of treason by the King's Commissioners and thrown into prison. This was at the close of the year 1102. The King's Commissioners who were sent to Shrewsbury on the occasion were \" Richard de Belmersh or Beleasmo, afterwards appointed by King Henry to be Warden of the Marches and governour of the Countie of Salop : Walter Constable, the father of Milo Earle of Hereford, and Rayner the King's lieutenant in the County of Salop.\"\u2014 If this be correct it shows us that Rainald, the Domesday Sheriff of Shropshire, had not joined Belesme's rebellion, but was in office at a subsequent period. It also shows that Richard de that he specially affected the society of wise Clerks. Richard de Belmeis' pro bable tenure of a lay fee at Meadowley has been already pointed out (Vol. I, p. 149) , and I am by no means sure that he does not occur elsewhere in Domesday, and in a simUar relation. 3 Poivel's Chronicle,?. 120 (Edit.1584). \" Cheese dooer about Roger Mountgomery, Earl of Salop.\" 4 Domesday does not record the names of Church.

It shows Richard de Belmeis in the King's employ indeed, and as concerned with the escheated honours of Robert de Belesme, but not yet holding office in Shropshire. And this precept passed \" in Council at Westminster ; \" \u2014 assuredly that very Council which the King is said to have held there at Michaelmas 1102.5 Within the next two months Belmeis will have been sent to Shrewsbury on the commission already described, and, as I believe, for more permanent objects. In fact, there is every reason to think that this Commission closed the Shrievalty of Rainald, and that Belmeis succeeded him, \u2014 but with fuller powers than an ordinary Sheriff, and having a deputy (Fulcoius) to discharge the routine duties of the office. This will appear from another precept of King Henry, the object of which was to support the title of the Monks of St. Remigius-at-Rheims to certain lands in Shropshire. This precept is addressed to \" Richard de Belmeis, and Fulqueius the Sheriff and all the Barons of Salopesire.\" It is dated \"at Westminster, in Council,\" and issued certainly at Christmas 1102.6 The Chartulary of St. Remigius-at-Rheims supplies us with another, and perhaps later precept of King Henry, which I quote here merely to show that Belmeis was on that occasion addressed simply as Sheriff of Salop ; 7 but I have before alluded to the 5 Monasticon, viii, 1168, No. xxviii. Wdliam de Werelwast, sole witness of this deed, attests many of the King's Charters at this period. He was sent as Ambassador to the Pope in 1103, and was consecrated Bishop of Exeter in 1107. the earliest of which bears date Jan. 13, 1103. Thus we obtain the limits within which this precept issued, viz. between Michaelmas 1102 (when Belmeis was not yet Viceroy) and Jan. 1103 (when Wal dric was Chancellor). The Court which King Henry held at Westminster (Christ mas 1102) is noticed by the Chroniclers and supplies the exact date. 6 We have two copies of this Deed (Monasticon, vii, p. 1043 ; v ; and p. 1099), one of which serves to correct the other. The sole witness, Walter or Waldric, Chaplain, attests other deeds of the period ; but immediately afterwards he became Chancellor, and as Waldric or Walter, Chancellor, attests various deeds, 7 Monasticon, vii, p. 1043 ; vii ; and p. 1099.

We now pass to his ecclesiastical career. \u2014 On Whitsunday (May 24), 1108, he was elected to the vacant See of London, and, not being in full Orders, was ordained Priest on one of the following Ember days (May 27, 29, or 30), by Archbishop Anselm at Mortlake.10 In July of this year the King was waiting on the coast of Sussex to embark for Normandy. Anselm came, at the King's request, to the sea-port that he might give the King his blessing, ere he sailed. On the night of his arrival Anselm was seized with sudden illness, and when morning came was so weak as to be unable to cross an arm of the sea which separated his hospice from that of the King. The Monarch, hearing thereof, sent the Bishops of Exeter and Winchester to excuse Anselm's attendance, and to recommend perfect rest. He however commended himself in his journey to the Archbishop's regard, his Son, whom he left behind, and his whole Kingdom, to the Archbishop's care. He besought him moreover, by the love he bore him, that he would consecrate Richard, Bishop-Elect of London, at Chichester, since that City was near, and there were Bishops at hand who could assist in the ceremony. The reason, says Eadmer, why the King was so urgent about this matter was alleged to be as follows : \u2014 \"because the said Richard was a most able man in secular affairs and the King was arranging to send him, on the instant, far off to the Western Marches of England, there to manage the King's concerns. Anselm had special reasons for not consecrating Belmeis at Chichester, but to oblige the King he performed the ceremony in his own Chapel at Pageham, on Sunday, July 26, the Bishops of Winchester, Salisbury, Chichester, and Exeter assisting.\"11 8 Supra, Vol. I, p. 245. his provincial office on his Consecration. The probability is that he returned to Shropshire with larger powers than ever. \u2014 I by no means adopt the reflection which in the same page is cast upon Powel's Chronicle. Its coincidences with ascertained truth are wonderful. 9 Salop Chartulary, No. 1. 10 Eadmer, p. 96. 11 Eadmer, pp. 96, 97. I have been particular in giving these details, because in the Sheriffs of Shropshire (p. 31) Belmeis is assumed to have relinquished"], [704, "196 TONG. Thus much from the Diary of Eadmer, the friend and companion of Anselm himself, and by far the most accurate of the Chro niclers of that age. On August 9, 1 108, \" Bishop Belmeis assisted at the consecration of Radulph Bishop of Rochester, and made a handsome offering to his Mother-Church of Canterbury, as indeed the King had desired him to do.\" Now, probably, Belmeis returned to Shropshire, for the Welsh Chronicler describing him as \" Richard, Bishop of London, whom the King had appointed Warden of the Marches,\" says he was at Shrewsbury in this year. There was a disturbance in Wales, for Owen ap Cadogan ap Blethyn7a Prince of the house of Powis, had forcibly carried off the wife and children of an Englishman, \u2014 Gerald Steward of Pembroke. The Bishop is represented as forthwith treating with Ithell and Madoc, sons of Riryd ap Blethyn (and so cousins of Owen) whom with other Welsh Chieftains he bribed to take or kill the offender, and revenge the insult offered to the King of England. Owen escaped to Ireland, but returning within the year was fortunate in finding his enemy Madoc ap Riryd at variance with the Bishop. The latter had, it seems, required Madoc to deliver up certain English Felons whom he was harbouring. Madoc refused, and his quarrel with the Viceroy led to his reconciliation with Owen, and their joint attack, in the following year, on the lands of all Norman or English settlers in Wales. Towards the end of May 1109, King Henry returned from Nor mandy, and the Viceroy of Shropshire was forthwith in attendance at Court. Archbishop Anselm being dead, it fell to this aspiring Prelate's lot to consecrate Thomas, Archbishop of York. This cere mony took place on June 27, 1109, in the Church of St. Paul's, London. In the Autumn of this year the King visited Shropshire and Nottinghamshire. It was at Castle-Holgate that he issued his writ, appointing Hervey, Bishop of Bangor, to the newly created See of Ely. It was also, as I suppose, during this Royal visit that the Bishop of London adjudicated, in the King's presence, that suit about a Prebend of Morville which has been already described..12 The Bishop of London passed on with the King to Nottingham, and 12 Supra, Vol. I, p. 32. The Assessors I in this trial were Alan Fitz Flaald, Hamo I Peverel, Roger and Robert Corbet, and Herbert son of Helgot."], [705, "197 TONG on Oct. 17, attended the General Council, at which was finally settled the constitution of thc See of Ely. At Christmas 1109, the King held another great Court at London, and with more than usual pomp. Thomas, Archbishop of York, was in attendance, expecting that, the See of Canterbury being vacant, he would have to celebrate mass before the King and place the Crown on the King's head. The Bishop of London however led the King by the hand into Church and perforrped the said ceremonies. Afterwards, meeting at the King's table, the two Pre lates again disputed about their precedence, whereupon the King dismissed them both to dine at home, not wishing to hear their quarrel. The Bishop of London's conduct on this occasion was justified by him on two grounds, viz. that being Dean of Canterbury he was the proper representative of the Primacy ; and that his Con secration having preceded the Archbishop's he was, according to St. Gregory's Institutes, the superior. Eadmer, who relates aU this, knew in fact that it was for the sake of attaining this precedence that Belmeis had hurried forward his own consecration, though other grounds (as above related) had been given out to the public. Eadmer had the truth not only from private friends of the Bishop, but from the Bishop's own acknowledgment in familiar conversation with Eadmer himself.13 Belmeis now probably returned to Shropshire, where the unsettled state of the Border must have required his constant presence. Owen and Madoc, before mentioned, had wound up their enormities by the murder of a Bishop, WUliam de Brabant, which so enraged the King that they thought it prudent to retire for a time to Ireland. The year 1110 however found Madoc again in the Principality and ready to purchase the favour of Belmeis. This he effected by murdering Cadogan ap Blethyn, Owen's Father, whom, with his said son Owen, the Bishop most speciaUy detested. Madoc was rewarded by Belmeis with a grant of lands, but Owen, returning at the same time from Ireland, effected a separate reconciliation with the King, in person. This is the last direct notice which we have of the interference of Richard de Belmeis in Welsh affairs. The grossest treachery seems to have pervaded this part of his policy, but it was perhaps balanced by specific circumstances with which, of course, the Welsh Chro niclers do not acquaint as. They draw, however, a general picture of Wales and its Rulers, faithful enough, and which warrants a 13 Eadmer, p. 105. ii. 26"], [706, "198 TONG suspicion of the very worst particulars. The King invaded the Country in 1114, but his success, whether in arms or negotiation, had no permanent results. Utter subjugation came in the course of ages to cure those inherent evils, which Wales self-governed must have fostered and suffered from, tUl the end of time. Of the duration of Belmeis' power in Shropshire we have no direct information. The apparent dates of the various precepts which the King addressed to him in that capacity, must suffice for our information on this head. The latest of these I have already quoted, as having passed between 1121 and 1123.14 His resignation at a somewhat later date will appear probable from circumstances presently to be mentioned. Of Belmeis as a Jurist, we know little more than the great authority with which he was invested, and which, within his Pro vince, was equal to that of Royalty, itself. What appears more extraordinary still is, that he should be found presiding at a purely Ecclesiastical Synod of the district. His judgments, the few which remain, belong properly to the localities which they affected. Two of them are preserved to us in his own words as he recorded them in the royal form and style of Letters Patent. The first was given apparently about a. d. 1110, in a Court composed of Church Digni taries and Laymen which sat at Wistanstow. The second was his decision given in an Archidiaconal Synod at Castle Holgate, about 1115.15 The extraordinary prescriptive rights of Wenlock Priory were on both occasions in question, and Belmeis supported them with most determined and transparent zeal. Something more should be said of his, not very frequent, appearance in the King's Court or in company with his fellow Suffragans, something too of his connection with his own See and Diocese. On August 1111, he was with the King at Waltham (Hants), where the latter was waiting to embark for Normandy. In Sep tember 1114, he attended the King when similarly delayed at Burnham (Essex). On June 27, 1115, he was present at the En thronement of Archbishop Ralph at Canterbury; and, on Dec. 28 14 Supra, Vol. I, p. 246. He is both addressed in, and stands first witness to, a Charter of Henry I, which passed at Shrewsbury in the same interval. (Salop Chartulary, 46, c.) King Edward treats the Bishop's acts with the same respect as those of any King his predecessor ; \u2014 e.g. \"Inspeximus litteras patentes quas Celebris memori\u00e6 Ricardus Londinensis Episcopus fecit Wenlocensi Ecclesi\u00e6 in h\u00e6c verba.\" 16 Pat. 22 Edw.

On April 4, 1120, he assisted at the Consecration of David, Bishop of Bangor; on January 16, 1121, at that of Richard, Bishop of Hereford ; and on October 2, 1 121, at that of Gregory, Bishop of Dublin ; which last two took place at Lambeth . In this same year he attests Royal Charters at Windsor and West minster. On February 16, 1123, WiUiam Curboil, Prior of St. Osyth's (a house of Belmeis' foundation), was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury. William Gifford, Bishop of Winchester, performed the ceremony, apparently because the Bishop of London was at the time suffering from paralysis.16 He will, however, have affixed his own signature to a great Charter which Henry I expedited, later in the same year, to the Church of Exeter.17 WUliam of Malmsbury, speaking of Maurice, Belmeis' prede cessor in the See of London, commends him for his magnificent improvements in St. Paul's Cathedral. \" But such,\" he adds, \" was the extravagance of his design that he left his successors to pay the cost of his vast undertakings. And at length, when Richard his Successor had assigned all the Episcopal Revenue to the building, supporting himself and his kindred from other sources, he seemed as though he accomplished nothing in proportion to such a prodigal outlay. Wherefore as years passed by he grew weary and despairing of the good intent which he entertained in his early Episcopacy, and by degrees fainted therein.\" \" There is a place,\" continues Malmsbury, \"in London Diocese, commonly called Cic (Chich) by the East-Saxons, where rests Saint Osyth, that Virgin famous for miracles. This house had Richard amplified with certain grants of land and the introduction of Regular Canons. There were here, and still are, Clerks of noted learning; and a joyful harvest, so to speak, clothed the whole country under the example of men thus trained. And the Bishop himself was at one time minded to retire hither and cast off the ensnarements of the world, especially as he had experienced some warning from a chronic paralytic disorder ; but the habit of power restrained his mind, diseased as it was with such allurements. WiUiam, who succeeded Ralph in the Archiepiscopacy, was the first Prior of this House, who, though a Clerk, and at first | ,1 Monasticon, ii, 539, 20. 16 Diceto, p. 504."], [708, "200 TONG dreaded by the Monks (of Canterbury), yet did nothing to cause them regret, being a man of sound religion, great affabUity, and neither slothful nor hasty.\"18 Richard de Belmeis, besides his greater donations to St. Paul's Cathedral and the Priory of St. Osyth, was also a Benefactor to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell. There is much probability that at the last, he retired to St. Osyth's and died there. The latter event took place on January 16, 1127. When he felt his end approaching, he was careful to make formal record of a certain act of restitution which he owed to the Abbey of Shrewsbury. His Confessors were his own Nephew William, Dean of St. Paul's, aud Fulk, a Prebendary of the same Church, who had succeeded William Corboil in the Priory of St. Osyth. The said Prior certified this act of restitu tion in a series of letters addressed to the King, to WiUiam, Archbishop of Canterbury, to Bernard, Bishop of St. David's, and to G (Geoffrey), Abbot of Salop.\u2014 The Archbishop transmitted his intelligence to Pagan Fitz John (then Sheriff) and all the Barons of Shropshire.19 This restitution related to the Manor of Betton. Another, not so circumstantially recorded, was of the Church of Donington. It has been already noticed. A third was of the Church of Tong, and perhaps took place before the Bishop was in extremis. It was tested by Roger, Archdeacon of Salop, Clarembald the Clerk, and John, Clerk of the Queen.20 The Canons of St. Osyth procured the interment of their dis tinguished Benefactor, within their Priory Church, where a marble tomb long bore the following inscription : \u2014 Hie jacet Richardus Beauveis, cognomine Rufus, London : Epis copus, vir probus et grand\u00e6vus, per totam vitam laboriosus, fundator noster religiosus, et qui multa bona nobis et ministris ecclesi\u00e6 su\u00e6 Sancti Pauli cOntulit.

We have nothing however here to do with the Prebendaries of St. Paul's. Belmeis' successor iu all those Churches and lands in Shropshire, which having first belonged to Godebald (the Priest) and Robert son of Godebald, had been conferred by Henry I on the deceased Prelate, was Richard de Belmeis his Nephew. The latter had a special grant of the same from the King, which is preserved, and must have passed about August 1127. 22 This second Richard de Belmeis was son of Walter de Belmeis, brother of Richard de Belmeis I. I shall have to notice him again as Founder or Co founder of LilleshaU Abbey, and also as eventually occupying the See of London. The temporal heir of Richard de Belmeis (I), was another son of his Brother Walter, viz. PhUip de Belmeis, of whom as succeeding to the Lordships of Tong and Donington I am now to speak. When Richard de Belmeis on his deathbed directed the restora tion of Betton to Salop Abbey, he intimated the possible alternative that his Nephew Philip might be able to re-obtain it by the good will and free concession of the Monks. Fulk, Prior of St. Osyth, before the Bishop had expired, informed Philip de Belmeis, his Knights and serving-men, of the expressions of his Uncle and the state of the case. It appears however that Philip did not acquiesce in the proposed restitution. A suit in the King's Court ensued, and a trial was to have been held before the King and the Archbishop of Canterbury at Woodstock, probably about Easter 1127. \u2014 Then however Philip de Belmeis made default (defecit a jus titia) and Betton was restored to the Abbey, Archbishop William, Legate of the Apostolick See, certifying the same to all the faithful.23 Philip de Belmeis next appears in litigation with Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Lichfield. PhUip had seized upon some land (probably lying between Tong and Brewood) to which the Bishop had a claim. The latter was consequently, in 1130, indebted two merks to the King, his fine \" that Philip de Belmeis might try legal issue with him (placitet versus eum)\" as to the land so seized.24 Between this time and the year 1135, we find Philip de Belmeis holding three Knights' Fees in the Honour of Arundel.25 We have 25 Liber Niger, i. 65. \u2014 The Liber Niger is mainly a return of the years 1165-6, and the much earlier date which I thus confidently assign to a particular section 22 Monasticon, vi, p. 262, No. ii. 23 Salop Chartulary, No. 56. 24 Rot.

It was probably this Sussex Tenure which, in the year 1138, separated Philip de Belmeis from the cause for which the greater Feodaries of Shropshire were contending, and associated his inter ests with those of an Usurper. When Stephen, in August of that year, was besieging Shrewsbury, Philip de Belmeis was with him, and attested the Charter whereby the King confirmed the then recent foundation of Buildwas Abbey.26 thereof needs explanation. I enter into the question more fully as I shall again have to quote this document with refer ence to Shropshire names. \u2014 The Earl of Arundel making a return in 1165-6 of the Knights'-Fees in the Honour of that the return made by the four Knights was referable to an earlier period than 1165. He identified the \"army of Wales\" spoken of with that of 1159 (meaning, I suppose, 1157). Vide Rot. Norman, ii, xxxiij. Arundel, prefaces his statement thus : \u2014 \" Our Lord Kiug Henry, on occasion The same internal evidence which led Mr. Stapleton to that discovery leads me still further. Savaric, one of the Tenants of the Honour, was dead in Stephen's reign, and his Son and Successor, Ralph, dead before 1157. Alan de Dunstanvill also was dead before 1156, and Hugh de Faleise, a third Tenant, has occurred to us as a man of great trust in Sussex fifty years before Mr. Stapleton's date of 1159. Less proof than this would suffice; for, having once established the date of the four Knights' assessment to be earlier than 1156, we must go back at least to 1135. There was no intermediate \"army of Wales\" levied by any King Henry. Now Henry I meditated an invasion of Wales in 1135. We do not indeed hear of the levy of an English army on that occasion, and the King's immediate death (Dec. 1135) is hardly consistent with his alleged unwillingness to disturb the as sessment, if of the current year. Yet I cannot help referring the whole matter to that year. At all events the assessment appears to be later than 1130. of a certain dispute which arose among the Knights of the Honour of Arundel about a certain Army of Wales, chose four of the better, more legal, and more ancient Knights, and caused them to make recognition of the Knight's service of the Honour ; and he was unwilling thereafter to listen to any one touching the legality of those -four Knights' decision and their sworn return. And this was their re- cognition,\" &c. This preface (which I translate from the original and not from Hearne's inaccurate transcript) is followed by a list of the lands and persons on which and on whom the said four Knights assessed the relative proportions of service. Among them is the name of Philip de Belmeis, assessed at three fees ; of Alan de Dunstanvill, assessed at eight fees ; of Hugo de Faleise, assessed at five fees ; and of Savaric, as sessed at three fees. Then follows a further statement made by the Earl himself of such Feoffments as he had since granted in the Honour. 26 Monasticon, v, 356, No. i.

Its further significances I must at present postpone. \u2014 Philip de Belmeis' patronage of the Order of Savigny was for some reason or other soon withdrawn. Not ten years after his grant to Buildwas, he is seen to be promoting, if not himself founding an Abbey in the immediate neighbourhood of Tong, and of a totally different class. Nay further, his mode of establishing this second House must have materially diminished the value of his former benefits to Buildwas.

They found soon afterwards a more permanent resting place at Lilleshall, and when settled there, continued to enjoy all the benefits conferred on their fraternity by Philip de Belmeis. The Lizard however instead, of being the Site of their house, became as we shaU see, only a Grange thereof. There are other points in PhUip de Belmeis' Charter which require notice. Two boundaries of the land granted for the foundation of a Church are named. These are Watling Street, the Northern boundary, and Meredich, which I conclude to have been the Eastern, and identical with the rivulet which flowing from North to South, now supplies a spacious artificial lake known as Tong-Mere. The Western limit of Belmeis' grant wiU consequently have been the Manor of Idsall, its Southern his own domain of Tong. The Lizard Grange, thus bounded, is stiU in name a Grange, and though the locality be otherwise unremarkable, it has its interest to the Antiquary, as having been the germ and once proposed site of an establishment, which grew elsewhere to great magnificence. 28 It does not appear who William Meschin, Father of Matdda de Belmeis, was. Dugdale's account (Baronage, i, 89) of WiUiam de Meschines, Lord of Coup land, and Brother of Ranulph Earl of Chester, would not, as far as date is con cerned, except him from being the person named. But this Wdliam de Meschines appears eventually to have been repre sented by a daughter and sole heir, Cecdy wife of Robert de Romely. However, Dugdale's, and indeed all other accounts of the Barony of De Meschines, are either confused or inconclusive, and I think it possible that further evidence may connect Matilda with that house. The second William D'Albini of Bel voir is also said to have been surnamed Mcschines. A probability that his family might intermarry with that of Belmeis, arises from their relative positions in the same County (Leicestershire) ; but the era of the Albini specified is too late to allow of his having been Father of Matilda de Belmeis. 29 Monasticon, vi, 262 ; iii ; \u2014 where the document is accurately printed in the original Latin. 27 11."], [714, "206 TONG It is probable that Philip de Belmeis' possession of Ashby (now Ashby de la Zouch) and Blackfordby in Leicestershire arose under a grant thereof by Henry I, to his Uncle the Bishop.

It is almost certain that he had Manors also in Staffordshire, and probable that some estates in Cheshire and other Counties which were held by his heirs were derived from him. The last feature which I shall here notice in his Charters is that attestation by Tenants of the Honour of De Lacy which may serve to throw some light on a great and as yet unexamined genealogical problem. I cannot suppose that PhUip de Belmeis long survived his grant to the Arroasian Canons of Dorchester. Of Philip de Belmeis the younger I have only one notice as his Father's Successor. Calling himself PhiUp, Son of PhUip de Beumes, and addressing Walter, Bishop of Coventry (who sat from Oct. 1149 to Dec. 1159), he confirms to \"the Canons Regular of St. Mary of Lilleshill, of the Order of Arroasia, aU the land which lies between Watlingestret and Merdische, and also the Church of Aessibi with that of Blackfordbye.\"30 Philip de Belmeis junior, who was Bring at the time of Henry II's 30 Dodsworth, vol. ex, so. 43, b.

The scheme is however inconsistent with the very evidence on which Dodsworth founds it. A Trial about the Manor of Betton, which is recorded on the Rolls of Hilary Term, 1226, gives WiUiam de Belmeis as the Brother and next heir of Phdip Junior, and omits all mention of Ranulph. This is a mere mistake of the Law-Clerk. At a previous stage of tho same suit, during the County Assizes of 1221, the descent was declared to have been as stated in the text ; and much secondary evidence confirms the better authority of the Provincial Record. The annexed Pedigree of Belmeis and La Zouche is, I believe, accurate in all points which it distinctly asserts. The doubts which are inseparable from such an investigation I have indicated by waved lines, or such other marks as seemed suitable for the purpose. The deed therefore passed between 1152 and 1159.

In a donum of the Knights of Nottinghamshire, recorded Michaelmas 1159, Radulf de Bealmes' proportion (two merks) is pardoned by writ of the King.31 A Certificate remains on the Salop Chartulary, whereby Ranulph de Belmeis, addressing all his heirs, kindred, friends, and vassals, tells them that he came before the full County of Salop aud there acknowledged that he wrongfully held Betton, which belonged to the Monks of Shrewsbury, and which his Ancestors had unjustly held. He restored it, and was thereupon received into the Society of the said Monks. Of this were witnesses the Barons and Knights of the whole County.32 In the Liber Niger (1165-6), his return as a Tenant in capite is not preserved. His Tenure at Meadowley, indicated in that Record, has been already noticed. But a Tenure of three Knights' Fees held by him under the Baron Stafford at that period, is fully stated and requires particular notice. These fees were apparently of old feoffment, that is, had been bestowed on Ranulf 's ancestors before the death of Henry I. His Under-Tenant in two thereof was John Bigod (Bagod) and in the third, Hervey de WUbrichtone.33 Ranulph de Belmeis therefore may be taken to have been Mesne- Lord of BlymhiU, Brinton, and WUbrighton, all in the County of Stafford. His Tenure in Sussex at the same period has before been noticed, viz. as standing in the Record under the name of his Father. At this period Ranulph de Belmeis seems to have been employed by Henry II in Wales. The Castles of Rhuddlan and Basingwerk had remained in the King's hands since 1157, when they were garrisoned by him as a result of his first Welsh campaign. At Michaelmas 1166 the Sheriffs of Warwickshire and Leicestershire had paid \u00a310. by the King's order to Randulph de Belmes for garrison (municionem) of the Castles of Basingwer, Roelend and Prestinton (Prestatton) .

She, whether single at the time or a Widow, is recorded under the name as Alice de Beaumeys as having granted the Mill of Tong to Lilleshall Abbey.35 I do not find this gift to have had any sub sequent confirmation, nor can I think that it was operative. I proceed now to speak of the Husband and the descendants of this Heiress. \u2014 Alan la Zouche, son of Geoffrey Vicomte of Rohan in Brittany, was doubtless descended from the reigning Earls or Dukes of that province.36 The particular line of such descent I will not here attempt to determine. Its general probability arises from three considerations, viz. that those Earls had had various interests in England ever since the Conquest, that others of their descendants were surnamed La Zouche, and that Swavesey (Cambridgeshire), which had originally been given to one of these Earls, subsequently belonged to Zouche of Ashby. It was in the Spring of 1166 that Henry II, by an able negotia- 34 Rot. Pip. 12 & 13 Hen. II. fusion. \u2014 The only Earl Alan of Bretagne whose Father's name was Geoffrey was Guardian of William I, when Duke of Normandy, and died by poison in 1040 ; whereas Alan, first Lord Zouche of Ashby, was living in 1186, and is not said on good authority to have been son of any Earl Geoffrey, but of Geoffrey Vicomte of Rohan. Moreover this Alan la Zouche of Ashby was succeeded by his son Wil liam, WiUiam by his Brother Roger, and Boger by his son Alan, \u2014 a descent not strictly identical with anything implied by the Swavesey Charter. 35 Patent, 18 Eic. II, p. 1, memb. 7. 36 Dugdale (Baronage, i, p. 688), pre facing his account of Zouche of A_hby, Bays as follows : \u2014 \" That this Ancient and Noble Family is branched from the Earls of Britanny, all our Genealogists do agree; though they do not deduce the Line of that Descent in each Point alike. To the intent therefore that it may the more clearly appear how it is, I have thought fit to take notice, That Widiam la Zusche in that confirmation to the Monks of Swavesey in Cambridgeshire, of the grants made by his Ancestors unto the Abbey of S. Segius and Bacus in Anjow (whereunto this Priory of Swavesey was a Cell) calleth Roger la Zusche his Father, and Alan la Zusche Earl of Britanny (Son of Geffrey) his Grandfather. \u2014 That document, if it proves anything (and is accurate as well as genuine), proves that other descendants of the Earls of Britanny, besides Zouche of Ashby, were called La Zouche and had a claim upon Swavesey. Further to explain the Swavesey Char ters (Monasticon, vii, 1001) I am unqua lified. The attempt would involve a dis sertation on the descent of the Earls of Bretagne, a problem of sufficient interest and difficulty to fill a volume.

Conan Le Petit, the reigning Earl, gave his daughter Constance to Geoffrey, third son of the English King, a boy then in his eighth year, and ceded his power to Henry, as Guardian of the infant couple. Henry, after receiving the homage of the Bretons at Thouars (in Poitou), passed on to Rhedon and Dol, principal Cities of the newly acquired Province, to settle the details of his future government. As a natural sequence of these transactions I reckon the promo tion of Alan la Zouche in England. \u2014 It was clearly the policy of our early Kings to contrive that thc most influential of their foreign Vassals should have possessions on this side the Channel. The allegiance thus secured was based on the most available though not the noblest of human motives, \u2014 self-interest. Thus, I conceive, did Henry II deal with Alan, Son of Geoffrey Vicomte of Rohan. In 1172, I find Alan La Zuche assessed at and paying 20s. for the Scutage of Ireland, in respect of one Knight's Fee which he held in capite in Northamptonshire.37 Two law-suits which concerned lands in that County, and in which he was Defendant, are mentioned on the latter Pipe-Rolls of Henry II. One of these seems to have involved a great interest, and to have originated about 1177 ; the other which concerned land of \u00a35. annual value commenced about 1186. This Alan la Zouche describing himself as Son of Geoffrey the Vicomte, and for the health of himself, his wife Alice, and their children (puerorum) , and for the souls of Philip de Beumeis senior, Philip junior, and his (Philip senior's) other Sons, confirmed and increased the grants above cited to Lilleshall Abbey. His Charter specifies the Church of Essebi ; the Chapel of Blackfordeby with sixty acres in the latter and three virgates in the former v ill ; a fourth virgate outside the vill (of Ashby) which was William Forester's ; the land of Haco Sutor ; all the land of Suarteclyve between the road from Pakynton to Brcdon and the boundaries through the wood ; the land of Overton ; tithe of his mills ; the land of Lusard ; and accommodation in his wood of Tong Castle.38 37 Liber Ruber, so. xlix; Madox Exche quer, page 403, p. a transcript of this deed, which gives the witnesses.

Another notice which I have of this William is in connexion with Tong ; viz. how, conceiving the Advowson of the Church to belong to him, he forcibly ejected a Clerk who had been admitted thereto by Hugh Bishop of Coventry (and therefore between 1188 and 1194), on presentation of Salop Abbey. William la Zouche was deceased before June 1199, and without issue ; for then did Roger his Brother fine \u00a3100. for his lands. The Sheriffs of Devonshire, Sussex and Shropshire were ordered each to take security for a third of this debt.40 But, at Michaelmas 1201, the Sheriff of Devon had received the final instalment of \u00a340. At the Salop Assizes of 1203, Roger la Zuche essoigned his attendance, his excuse being that he had gone beyond sea before the general summons had issued. \u2014 Herewith are connected some matters of contemporary History. \u2014 King John is said to have assassinated Arthur Earl of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey and Constance before mentioned, on Thursday de Mortimer, Alcher, Richard de London, WiUiam Cardiffe, Roger Clerk, EUas CodreU, Robert de SudenhaU (SydnaU), Dame Adheliza de Belmes, William de Belmes her Son, Philip de Belmes his Brother, and Robert de Horseley.

The King was certainly at Rouen on that and three following days (Good Friday and Easter Sunday were two of them), and Arthur was never seen afterwards. When this crime was rumoured in Brittany, the Bretons determined to avenge it. They joined with Philip Augustus in that united attack on John's territory which ended in the loss of Normandy. Roger la Zouche was a Breton by descent, as we have seen already. We now see why the Lord of Tong was not in attendance on the King's Justices when summoned to Salop in October 1203. Roger la Zouche's foreign sympathies involved the forfeiture of all his English possessions ; \u2014 On June 14, 1204, King John's precept issued to the Sheriff of Shropshire, commanding him to give William de Braose full seizin of such lands in his Bailiwick as had been Roger La Zouche's and which were of the Fee of said William.41 It is quite clear that under this writ William de Braose, then a great favourite of King John, became seized of Tong, but how Zouche had held it under him or how he (Braose) had any previous interest there I have never seen the slightest evidence. \u2014 Later hints however are not wanting to show that Tong was reputed to be held of the Honour of Brecknock and of the Barony of Braose. But to continue \u2014 on August 15, 1204, the King's Bailiff in Sussex had orders to give up to William Briwere all Roger la Zouche's lands in that quarter, which lands were of the Honour of Petworth.43 In the 6th of John (1204), a valuation was taken of the \" Lands of the Normans,\" that is, of the English possessions of such Vassals of the King as had adhered to Philip Augustus. Roger la Zouche's lands appear more than once on this Record. His Manor of North molton in Devonshire was worth \u00a312. per annum, without the stock thereon , Brictelegh a member of Northmolton was worth 40s. It belonged to William Fitz Warin, a Feoffee and Partizan of Roger la Zouche. \u2014 Esseby La Zuche in Leicestershire, the land of Roger la Zuche was estimated, if stocked, to yield \u00a310. per annum.

He died an Exile and, if we may believe the Chroniclers, his Wife and Son were starved to death in the Dungeons of Windsor Castle. Roger la Zouche on the other hand continued to advance in the favour of John.

On the 15 th March 1217, still retaining the Lordships of Mapledurham and Peterfield, he is ordered to allow her dower in the same to Milisent, widow of the Earl of Evreux and then wife of William de Cantilupe junior.55 On the 4th of April and 10th and 11th of May 1217, various Precepts issued to the Earl of Salisbury, to Hugh de Vivon, to the Sheriffs of Leicestershire and Lincolnshire, and to Peter de Maulay, to give Roger la Zouche seizin of all such lands in his Fee as were tenanted by the King's enemies.56 I should here take notice that the Vicomtes of Rohan, who seem to have constituted an elder branch of the house, from which Roger la Zouche sprung, were at one time seized of con siderable estates in England. Alan, who appears to have been the last Vicomte thus seized, occurs in 1201, as Grantee of King John in the Manor of Costesei.57 The fact of this Alan's forfeiture of all his English estates is certain, though I am unable to ascer tain its exact time and cause. \u2014 Probably it resulted in the usual way, viz. that, during the reign of John, every man possessed of lands on both sides of the Channel was constrained to elect between two allegiances. His decision once made, all that he held under the Suzerain of his choice was confirmed and perhaps augmented, whilst he suffered a correspondent forfeiture in the other quarter.

This grant is expressed to be in recompense of lands which Roger \"had lost in Brittany, in the King's service.\" 59 On May 1, 1219, he has a grant of Fair and Market at Blactorinton ; and on July 9, the Sheriff of Norfolk is to give him certain lands in Bamburc, to hold during the King's pleasure, which lands had once belonged to the Vicomte of Roain, but had since been held of the \" King's Bailiwick,\" by William de Man deville, Earl of Essex.60 In July 1220, he appears in account with the Crown as one of the Executors of Enjuger de Bohun ; 61 and on August 6 of that year, has Royal License to go on a Pilgrimage to St. James' (of Compostella).62 At the Salop Assizes of November 1221, Roger la Zouche appears in various relations. His suit with the Abbey of Shrews bury for the Manor of Betton came on for hearing. The details of this cause belong to another portion of our History, but it happened that Roger la Zouche offered a statement of his descent, which is much to our present purpose as proving a great deal of what has been asserted above, merely on the evidence of Charters. \u2014 On this occasion Roger la Zouche claimed to be heir of Philip 68 Claua. i, pp. 366, 385. 59 Ibidem, pp. 366, 386. 60 Ibidem, pp. 391, 423. 61 Ibidem, p. 424. 62 Rot.

At the same Assizes, Roger la Zouche sued the Abbot of Shrewsbury for the Advowson of Tong, and without success. The particulars shall be given, when we come to speak of the Church. His resistance of Thomas de Chabbenore's claim on his estate shall also be noticed among the various contingents of his Shrop shire Fief, which we shall hereafter have to give account of. His quarrels with Buildwas Abbey should however be here particu larized, inasmuch as they probably resulted in a composition, and in a Charter of Roger la Zouche to Buildwas, whose date it is much to our purpose to establish. At these Assizes then, the Abbot of Buildwas was found to have \" erected a fence to the injury of Roger la Shuch's tenement in Tong.\" The fence was to be taken down, but the Abbot was excused any amercement by writ of the King.64 \u2014 The Abbot of Buildwas further appoints Brother Walter de Bolingehal, a Monk, his Attorney in several suits, one of which was a suit of novel disseizin between the said Abbot on the one hand, and Roger la Shuche and William de Vigeford (Hugeford) on the other. I cannot determine whether this was the same suit of novel disseizin which William de Hugeford had against the Abbot about a right of common pasture in Ideshal and which he with- drew.65 Soon after these transactions, as I imagine, \" Roger, son of Alan la Szouche,\" granted a full Charter of confirmation to Buildwas. Upton was then held by the Lords of Tong, perhaps under the Lords of IdsaU. It adjoined lands of BuUdwas Abbey, both at Ruckley and Hatton.

Roger la Zouche therefore was confirming not only his Ancestor's grant, but the grant of his Ancestor's Feoffee. Consequently this Deed implies his continued Seigneury over Donington, whose Lord is in fact the fifth witness. I should here notice that in May 1224, William de Serland and Nicholas de Molis were intrusted respectively with the Cambridge shire Manors of Fulburn and Suavesey, which, \\\\ix\\ _ng once belonged to the Vicomte of Rohan, had since been committed to William de Breant during the King's pleasure. In October following, the privileges which had been enjoyed by \" Allan de Roien,\" what time he was Lord of Fulburn, were ordered to be renewed to William de Serland.67 \u2014 We shall presently recur to this subject. In November 1229, Margery Bagot was suing Roger la Zouche under writ of novel disseizin for her free tenement in Blymhill.68 La Zouche doubtless retained at this period the same mesne interest in Blymhill which we have already ascertained to have belonged to his predecessor, Ranulph de Belmeis. 66 This Charter is in possession of George Pritchard, Esq., of Broseley. \u2014 The witnesses' names arc Walter de Hugeford, Henry de Hugeford, Gerard Fitz Toret, Engeram Chavel, Walter de Beaumeis, PhUip de Beaumeis, Thomas son of Reiner de Le, Thomas Clerk of Maurnes bury, Master Richard of Ideshale, Nicholas his Son, and many others. \u2014 armorial bearings proper to La Zouche, as distinct from those which the family afterwards adopted as inheriting from the Houses of De Quinci or De Belmeis.

Cantabr. which he possessed by the gift of Alan Vicomte of Roan, in exchange for all those lands which he, the said Roger, then possessed in Brittany.\" 70 This requires further illustration. \u2014 Roger la Zouche was at this time Sheriff of Devonshire, and high in the King's confidence. Henry himself was warring in France, if his first puny effort to recover his continental dominions can so be described. \u2014 The contest was one of diplomacy rather than strategy, and Henry's success seems mainly to have consisted in receiving the homage and allegiance of the Earl of Bretagne and of Alan Vicomte of Rohan. His concessions to both were enormous. Those to the Earl or Duke are not to our purpose ; but on the 12th of October, being then at St. Pabus, the King granted his Letters-Patent to Alan Vicomte of Rohan, promising that, if ever there should be variance between him (the King) and the Earl of Bretagne, the said Alan should not thereby lose his lands in England as long as he and his heirs discharged their services due thereon. Moreover the King granted to the said Alan an annuity of 200 merks, \u2014 to date from Michaelmas 1230, and to be paid to him and his heirs, till the King should assign them lands in England of equal value.71 It does not appear that any of the old possessions of the Vicomtes of Rohan were restored under this contract. Certainly Roger la Zouche transmitted Swavesey to his own descendants. I have thus far traced the evidences of this family of La Zouche in parts of the Kingdom distant from the County with which I am immediately concerned. \u2014 In so doing I have at least been able to correct some previous error as to the origin and relations of a great Baronial House. I doubt not that a still wider search among foreign documents might ascertain the precise affinity which existed between these English Zouches, the Earls of Brittany, and the Vicomtes of Rohan.

This Roger la Zouche must have lived to a great age, but I find no better evidence of the exact period of his death than is supplied by a license bearing date November 3, 1238, whereby the King allows Alan la Zouche, his Son and Heir, to pay his Father's debts to the Crown as he (Roger) had done, viz. by instalments of forty five merks yearly.74 The public career of Alan la Zouche was distinguished by steady loyalty, much capacity, and a proportionate advancement of his house in riches and honour. This great Jurist married Helen or Ela, daughter and co-heir of Roger de Quinci Earl of Winchester, in whose estates, involving a share of the older Earldom of Leicester, Zouche of Ashby was thenceforth a Co-parcner.

For this the Abbot received Alan and his heirs to all benefits and prayers which should thereafter be made in his Church of Buildwas for ever.75 On July 1, 1 247, another fine was levied at Westminster between the same plaintiff and Alan la Zuche, deforciant (by his Attorney Walter Fitz Warin) , of two carucates in Rochley, whereof was plea of fine-levied. Alan acknowledged the Abbot's right to said land, with the site and approach of Rochley Grange and whatever was con tained between said land and the water of Wrgh (Worf) down to Rochley wood, without any right of common therein belonging to Alan or his heirs, \u2014 all of the gift of Philip de Belmeis (as before) . And besides this, Alan conceded that the Abbot might take old stumps (sucum boscum for zucum boscum) in Rochley wood. Also he gave to the Abbot all the Tenement which he had in Upton on the day of this fine, in pure almoigne, but reserving foreign services due thereon. And Alan would warrant and defend the same against the Chief Lords from all services, suits of Court at Ideshall, &c. for ever. A provision follows in case of the Abbot's animals straying into Tonge Manor ; and the Abbot's free right of road between Rochley and the bridge towards Doneton is assured. \u2014 For all this the Abbot renounced his right of common-pasture in Thonge Manor and Brewude Wood, also his swine-stall in the latter ; also his right in a virgate of land which he and his Convent had by grant of the Black Nuns of Brewude.

Lastly, he renounced all his right to common pasture of Lusyard, towards the Grange of the Abbot of Lilleshull there, for ever.76 About the year 1250, as I suppose, Alan la Zouche seems to have the road which connect the North Western boundary of Tong-Manor with Shiffnal are stUl known as Timlet-Bridge and Timlet-Holloway.

William de Harcourt, thus seized of Tong, appears in January 1256, as subject to a very extraordinary prosecution by the Abbot of Lilleshall.77 He was summoned to give account as to \"where fore he had made such sales and wastes in the wood of Tong as that the Abbot could not get therein reasonable Estovers for his Grange of Lesyard.\" The Abbot complained that whereas he and his Pre decessors from the first foundation of Lilleshall Abbey had been in continual seizin of such right of Estovers, now the said William had wasted the wood, for he had given away 3000 oak-trees, had sold 3000 more, and had assarted 300 acres of the wood-land. The Abbot laid his damages thereby at forty merks. \u2014 William de Harcourt replied, denying all violence and injury, and asserting that the writ under which the Abbot sued him was of a novel and unheard-of nature, and that the Abbot could not be deprived of estovers, for that the wood in question extended to five leagues, and that the Abbot's Grange aforesaid did not contain more than one or two hearths (astra). \u2014 The Abbot rejoined, that though Harcourt did not deprive him of Estovers, he had already destroyed that part of the wood which was nearest to Lizard Grange, and was about to destroy it all. \u2014 The parties were ordered to attend at Westminster and hear sentence in the suit, on the Quinzaine of Easter. The loss of many Plea- Rolls prevents my tracing the successive adjournments of this suit, but in Easter Term 1260, it was still unsettled, and the Sheriff had been ordered to distrain William de Harcourt to appear at Westminster and hear judgment. He appears accordingly and requests that the Record of what had passed at Salop be read over in Court. This being done, William expresses his willingness to let the Abbot have what is sufficient, and avers that enough of wood remains for that purpose. The Abbot replies, that he cannot have estovers so conveniently as he claims, and appeals to a Jury of the district. The Sheriff is ordered to summon such a Jury to Westminster for the Quinzaine of St. John the Baptist ; but afterwards, it is added, the Parties agreed.78 \"8 Placita, Easter Term, 44 Hen.

He (Alan) grants and confirms to John de Pres and his heirs all lands, tenements, and liberties contained in the Charter of Sir William de Beumys, of the feoffment of Roger le Verner, and of Sir Roger his (Alan's) Father, and of Robert Collet, which Charter said John has in his keeping.

Harcourt had chosen the losing side and had forfeited all his estates in 1265 ; but his infant daughters were no sharers in his loss. The better-chosen and more successful policy of their maternal Uncle, Alan la Zouche, secured them a powerful intercession. On the 22d of October 1267, the King's Letters-Patent certi fied that at the instance of Alan la Zuche and in aid of the mar riages of Orabell and Margery, daughters of William de Harecourt and Nieces of the said Alan, the King conceded the redemption of Tonge and Ayliston and the Soke of Stratton, lands of William de Harcourt, according to the Dictum de Kenilworth?1 As regards Tong this transaction only entailed upon these Sisters that which was reasonably theirs as the only issue of their Mother. In July 1270, Sir William de Harcourt was dead, leaving his second wife Hillaria surviving. Later in the same year died Alan la Zouche, and apparently without having apportioned between his Nieces the lands which he had redeemed for them conjointly. About this time Orabell the elder of these Ladies married Henry son of Henry de Pembruge, whose family, if not himself, had been distinguished among the Anti-Royalists of the preceding period.

Henry and Orabil acknowledged the premises to be the right of Margery, to hold of the Chief Lords of the Fee by accustomed services ; and Margery conceded to Henry and Orabil the Manor of Tonge (Co. Salop) to hold to Henry and Orabil and the Heirs of Orabil, of the Chief Lords of the Fee, for ever.84 The Suit and Fine therefore constituted nothing more than a legal and perhaps amicable partition of the estate of two Co parcners.

Moreover within the same period died Orabil, wife of Henry de Pembruge, leaving an only son Fulk.

The Defendant not appearing, the Manor was ordered to be seized into the King's hand, and the cause was adjourned.89 Of Godfrey de Gamages and his sometime interest in Stottesden it will be better to speak when we reach that Manor. Here I would observe that Henry de Pembruge's wife Elizabeth, though a daughter and Coheir of Godfrey de Gamages, was either a different daughter to Lucia for whose marriage Henry de Pembruge senior had fined in 1254, or else was described at different periods by two distinct names. Henry de Pembruge does not appear to have ever recovered any interest in Stottesden, and for this or some other cause of discontent, he became a strenuous supporter of Montfort's treason in 1265 : \u2014 nay it was alleged that after the Battle of Evesham (August 4), and after the Council of Winchester (in September following), he insulted Prince Edmund at Warwick, committed depredations, set fire to that Town, and was there taken prisoner. He seems to have been given in charge to Roger de Mortimer, under whom he held his Manor of Pembruge. Mortimer bestowed his captive in the dungeons of Wigmore, with what object or result we shall presently learn. the Manor as \"Eston\" in Herefordshire. 88 Rot. Fin. ii, 186. \"7 Rot. Chart. 32 Hen.

Weston (Gloucestershire) was given to Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York, Leye (Worcestershire) to Matthew de Gamages, and Gyllock (Herefordshire) to Hugh de Mortimer. Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, in virtue probably of a general licence which he had to confiscate all such lands of the King's enemies as were of his Fee, entered upon his Prisoner's Manor of Pembridge. Foreseeing however that such occupation would eventually be null and void, and that Henry de Pembridge, by the King's clemency, would ultimately have that power of redemption which was accorded to Rebels in general, by the Dictum de Kenilworth, Mortimer strove rather to realize the escheated Manor than to reclaim the unsteady faith of his Vassal. The Prisoner made a formal conveyance to Mortimer of the Manor and Advow son of Pembridge ; and not only that, but he wrote to his Tenants informing them of the transfer and their consequent change of fealty. He was further taken, or, as Mortimer afterwards asserted, went willingly, before the full Court of the County of Hereford and ratified the transaction. Mortimer seems however to have felt that all these concessions, extorted from a Prisoner, could not amount to a legal conveyance. A further security was desirable. He therefore got to his Castle of Wigmore the two sons of his Prisoner, Henry and Godefrid, and leaving them there as hostages to secure his own ascendancy over the Father, journeyed with the latter to the King's Court, then sitting at Clarendon. There on the Quinzaine of St. Martin in the 52d year of King Henry (Nov. 25, 1267) appeared Henry de Pembruge senior (so called with reference to his eldest son and because his own Father was now deceased), and acknowledged that he remitted and quitted to Roger de Mortimer all his right and claim in the Manor and Advowson of Pembruge for ever. He also undertook to give any such other security as Mortimer should devise in the matter, whether by Fine, to be levied in the King's Court, or otherwise.90 From Clarendon Mortimer seems to have conducted his Prisoner 1,0 Placita coram Rege, Michaelmas Term, 51 & 52 Hen.

Mortimer's object was gained, and Pembruge lost for ever the estate which gave name to his House. It is probable therefore that he was soon released, and indeed thus much is implied by a statement which says that he took measures in accordance with the Dictum de Kenilworth to redeem his other estates. Three years, or four at most, remained to him for such a purpose ; for in 1270, or 1271, he died, leaving his wife Elizabeth a widow, and that son Henry his heir, whom we have already noticed as a Hostage at Wigmore and as Lord of Tong in right of his wife Orabell, niece of Alan la Zouche. This youth, the third Henry de Pembruge of whom we give account, set himself strenuously to redeem the fallen fortunes of his house. In December 1271, his peace with the King is obviously implied by the terms \" faithful and beloved \" already quoted in connection with his name. On January 20, 1272, \" Henry, son of Henry de Pembrigg lately deceased,\" bad been suing the Archbishop of York, Matthew de Gamages, and Hugh de Mortimer, that they should allow him to redeem those, his lands, of which they were seized. On their refusal so to do, the King had issued a mandate to Nicholas Fitz Martin and his companions, Justices appointed to hear and determine all such suits in Herefordshire, Glouces tershire, and Worcestershire, apprising the said Justices of the Claimant's readiness to abide by the Dictum de Kenilworth, and ordering them, if he was entitled to the benefits of that edict, to summon the parties before them and do their duty, according to the form of the said edict, touching Henry de Pembruge's right to recover seizin of his estates. It would appear that the Justices thus instructed found the case to be beyond their jurisdiction. \u2014 Pembruge's claim to the benefits of the Dictum were denied by the Archbishop and others. So on the day last mentioned (Jan. 20, 1272) the parties appeared before the King himself. The Archbishop pleaded for all. He denied young Henry's right to the benefit of redemption, inasmuch as the Dictum de Kenil worth excluded, inter alios, those who had persisted in rebellion and rapine after the Council of Winchester (the \" peace proclaimed at Winchester \" he calls it) . He then instanced the elder Pembruge's conduct before recited. Young Pembruge, on the other hand, urged that the Dictum de u. 30"], [738, "230 TONG Kenihvorth applied to all transgressions up to the time of its pro mulgation, except those of the Citizens of London ; that his Father and, after his Father's death, he himself sued for redemption of their lands in conformity with the Dictum, which Dictum, he added, contained a special concession of the King's, viz. that no Rebel should suffer disinheritance. The suit or suits did not end on this occasion, but a postscript on the Roll states that soon after the King's death, in the octaves of Hilary (Jan. 20) the parties accorded by License, and it gives reference to a Roll of the said term in the first year of Edward I (1273) for particulars.91 \u2014 I find the Concord thus indicated. Thereby Henry de Pembruge relinquished to the Archbishop all his right to the Manor of Weston super Egge (Weston sub Edge) receiving in exchange 1000 merks and the Manor of Ullingwyke (Herefordshire) which he is to hold under the Archbishop at a penny rent, for all services. He also remits to the Archbishop all his right in the Manor of Norton (Gloucestershire), for a sum paid down and an annuity of \u00a310. chargeable on the Archbishop's Manor of Brockwode during the life of Elizabeth, Henry's Mother.93 How Henry de Pembruge recovered his other Manors of Gilloek (Herefordshire) and Leye (Worcestershire) from Mathew de Gam ages and Hugh de Mortimer I have not thought it worth while to inquire. Suffice it to say that he did regain them. Thus far successful, he opposed himself to the gigantic influence of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, suing him before the Justices Itinerant at Hereford for the lost Manor of Pembruge. The cause was adjourned to Westminster, where it came on for hearing before the King's Council in the octaves of Hilary (Jan. 20) 1274. The pleadings are given at an unusual length but are well worth epitomizing. \u2014 \" Henry son of Henry de Penebrigg sued Roger de Mortimer, Matilda his wife, and Ralph his Son for the Manor, &c. (except ten Librates of Land) of which Manor, &c. Roger and Ralph had unjustly disseized the Plaintiff's Father, whose heir the Plain tiff is.\"\u2014 The Record is ambiguous as to the appearance of the Defendants whether all or only Matilda pleaded by Attorney. Her plea was that she claimed to hold nothing in demesne ; Ralph's was that he 91 Placita coram Rege, Hilary Term, 56 Hen. Ill, memb. 11 dorso. \u00bb Abbrev. Placitorum, p. 185, b."], [739, "231 TONG held nothing except at will of his Father. So Roger was virtually the sole Defendant. He took exception to the word \" disseized\" used in the Plaintiff's writ, and alleged the Charter of Henry de Pembruge Senior, his letter to his Tenants, and his voluntary quit-claim in the County- Court as inconsistent with \" disseizin.\" \u2014 He produced also the documentary proofs of each transaction. The Plaintiff replied that Mortimer had ingress in the Manor by disseizin, not by the documents produced ; for he entered on the Manor while liis (the Plaintiff's) Father was a prisoner and before the documents were executed. Mortimer took exception to the form of the Plaintiff's proceed ings and asked judgment of the Court as to whether the Plaintiff was competent to sue under a writ \" de ingressu \" which involved mention of the term \" disseizin.\"93 The Plaintiff answered, that if his Father had demised the pre mises while in prison, a writ \" de ingressu,\" making mention of such imprisonment, was a form in which he was competent to sue ; he was however prepared to show that neither in nor out of prison had his Father ever demised the premises. \u2014 He repeated that Mortimer had ingress by disseizin, notwith standing that his Father had given him (Mortimer) a seizin by feoffment. He appealed to the Court to say whether he was com petent to sue under any other form of writ than that which he had employed. The Court's assent to this proposition may be inferred from the continuance of the pleadings. \u2014 Mortimer now again alleged the quit-claim in the County Court, his own seizin of the Manor for a long period, and finally Pem bruge's acknowledgment in the Curia Regis. To the Rolls of Pleas in that Court he now appealed. Henry acknowledged that such recognition had been made by his Father at the time and place stated; but he also showed how himself and his Brother being in Prison at Wigmore, his Father had acted under fear on their account and lest evil should befal them (we de eis pejus eveniret). He asks the Court's Judgment 93 There was a technical distinction between the writ \" de ingressu \" and the writ \" de nova disseizina.\" The former applied to cases of disputed property or right, the latter to cases of disputed pos- session. If a party had brought his action under the superior form, \" de ingressu,\" he could not, whUe that action was pend ing, sue under the inferior form."], [740, "232 TONG whether a recognition thus obtained should have force ; and that it was thus obtained he was prepared to prove before a Jury (per patriam). Mortimer hereupon expatiated on the freedom and impartiality of the Curia Regis, adding that if things had been as the Plaintiff stated, Pembruge Senior might have proclaimed the oppression in open Court at Clarendon, and, refusing the Recognition required of him, might have procured the enlargement of himself and his Sons. Thus far the pleadings on this occasion. \u2014 A Postscript on the same Roll intimates that another hearing took place at Westminster on Feb. 3 (1274), before Martin de Littlebury and other Justices appointed to terminate pleas ; that again, after death of said Martin, the cause came before Ralph de Hengham and his Fellows, and that then Mortimer appeared in Court and asserted that judgment had been given in his favour at the previous hearing before Martin de Littlebury, Nicholas de Stapleton and Master Richard de Stanes. The two latter, being survivors of the three, he called to bear record of the fact. Their record was that judgment was given to this effect, viz. that \" Mor timer and the other Defendants were dismissed sine die, and that Henry de Pembruge was adjudged to be in misericordid for a false claim.\"91\u2014 Such was the redress which misfortune obtained when it wrestled against power in the early years of King Edward, \u2014 the \" English Justinian.\" I now proceed to give the substance of the Inquisitions which were taken after the death of this Henry de Pembruge. The King's writs of di em clausit extremum bear date 18 February and 3 March 1279. A Worcestershire Inquest, which sat in con sequence, reported that the deceased held Leye (Legam) of the Abbot of Pershore and that Fulk his son and next heir was eight years of age. A second Inquest, which sat at Salisbury Castle on May 5, said that the deceased was Tenant of Lora de Saunford at North- Tudeworth (Wilts), but that of the age of Fulk his next heir, the Jurors knew nothing as he was not living in Wiltshire. The same Jurors found that Henry de Pembruge once held Weston sub Egge (Glouc.) of Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York, by 91 Placita apud Westm. coram Consilio Regis, Hilary Term, 2 Edw. I memb. 17 recto ct dorso."], [741, "233 TONG service of one Knight's-fee, but that the deceased, son of the said Henry, had quitted all his right in Weston to the Archbishop, for the Manor of Ullyngwyke (Heref.) and 1000 merks. A third Inquest was taken at Salisbury Castle on December 28, 1279. The Jury found that the deceased had not held Tudworth in capite, but that Roger la Zouche, who formerly held it under John Biset, gave the Manor to Gilbert de Stanford (Sanford) with his daughter Lora in frank -marriage, and that, after Gilbert's death,95 Lora gave it to Orabell, formerly wife of Henry de Pembruge, and to Fulk the son of said Henry and Lora (read Orabell). A fourth Inquest which sat in Herefordshire on Jan. 8, 1280, found that the deceased had held Gillock in capite by service of finding one man for fifteen days in time of war, &c ; \u2014 also that he had held a third part of the Manor of Ullingewyk of the Bishop of Hereford (read Worcester) by one-third of a Knight's-Fee ; \u2014 also that he held \u00a34. 17s. 8d. annual rent in Catteley of the gift of William Devereux by service of Id. per annum. A fifth Inquisition sat Jan. 26, 1280, in Leicestershire, and gave the following almost accurate account ; viz. that William de Harcourt, formerly Lord of Ayliston (Elstow), had two daughters, Orabell and Margery, to whom conjointly he gave the Manors of Ayliston and Tonge ; \u2014 that afterwards Henry de Pembruge married Orabell, and John de Cantilupe Margery; \u2014 that by consent, Tong remained to Henry and Orabell, and Ayliston to John ; \u2014 that John and Margery died seized of Ayliston, but without issue, so that thereby Ayliston reverted to Fulk the son and heir of Henry de Pembruge, which Fulk was now under age; \u2014 that Henry, Fulk's Father had therefore not died seized of Ayliston ; \u2014 that the Manor was held of Richard de Harcourt by one Knight's fee, and by Richard of the Earl of Winchester.96 These details, though slightly inaccurate, supply a general and quite intelligible truth. In this respect they differ widely from some Records of Law proceedings which took place during Fulk de Pembruge's minority. These latter, taken as they stand, present us with inconsistent and impossible results ; in fact, it is evident that the Law-Clerk who recorded these pleas did not 95 Gilbert de Saunford died in 1249, leaving a son and heir under age. Either that heir never attained his majority, or else was GUbert's son by another wife than Laura la Zouche. 36 Inquisitions, 7 Edw. I, No. 12."], [742, "234 TONG understand their drift. I have therefore thought it better, while giving the substance of the original minutes, to insert in brackets whatever I conceive to be necessary for their correction or ex planation. I should premise that Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York, seems to have conveyed, between 1272 and 1279, the Seigneury of Ullingwike to Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester. In October 1282, the following is given as the result of a plea heard before the King or his Deputies. \" The Bishop of Hereford (read Worcester) recovers his seizin of two parts of the Manor of Ollingwyk alias Ullingwyk by reason of the Minority of Henry de Penebrigg. Fulco, brother of the same Henry,97 who had custody of the said Henry by gift of the Queen, concedes that all tenements>which he holds of his brother's inheritance together with the dower of Alice his wife (read Mother, i. e. Mother of Henry, step-mother of Fulk, and widow of Henry Fulk's father) shall be put in hochepot ; \u2014 and that Fulk shall have two parts and Alice the third part, but not of the Manor of Todeworth in Co. Wilts.\" 98 Another Record of this same plea intimates that it was heard at Salop, in three weeks of Michaelmas 1282, before the King or his Deputies. Its substance is as follows ; \u2014 , \" The Sheriff had mandate to bring into Court Alice, widow of Henry de Pembruge, that she might respond to Godfrey, Bishop of Worcester, in the following suit,\" \u2014 viz. \" Whereas custody of two parts of Ollingewyk, which belonged to Henry de Pembruge de ceased, except 17*. rent, pertained to the Bishop until the age of the heir \" (read devisee), \" in that it was held by Knight's-service, \u2014 and whereas Alice now held those parts in dower, \u2014 whether she, Alice, had ought to allege why the said Bishop should not have those two parts in custody.\" The Sheriff had also mandate to bring into Court \"Fulk de Pem bruge, who was to have with him the heir (read younger son) of Henry de Pembruge, in order that he Fulk, might do and receive as regarded the tenements which Fulk holds of the inheritance of the aforesaid heir (read younger son), and which had belonged to Henry his (Henry's) Father, and brother (read Father) of the said Fulk, whatever might appear just.\" \u2014 97 Fulk Pembruge himself was not yet twelve years of age. 98 Abbrev. Placit, 274. I am unable to discover the original or duplicate of the original Record which the Abbreviator of thePlacita must have used in compiling this abstract."], [743, "235 TONG, Now Fulk appears ; and Alice appears, and concedes that the Bishop may have custody of the said two parts of Ullingwyk saving to Alice her goods lying in that Manor. So the Bishop recovers the same. Fulk, on the other hand, pleads that he cannot bring the heir (devisee) into Court, because he is in the Queen's custody : and as to the dower of Alice, Fulk concedes that all the tenements which he, Fulk, holds of the inheritance of Henry his Brother, together with the dower of Alice, be put in hochepot, and that Fulk should have back two parts thereof and Alice have her dower. And Alice agrees to this, if so be that she shall have such dower in the Manor of Toddeworthe, Wiltshire. \u2014 Fulk replies that Toddeworthe was not of the inheritance of Henry (his Father), nor had he anything there except in the name of Orabell his first wife, because he, Fulk, says that Lora de San ford gave the Manor to Orabell and to Fulk, Orabell's son, by a charter which he produces. Whereupon Fulk asks judgment of the Court if Alice ought to have dower therein. Alice replies that Henry (her husband) held the same by inheritance, and asks that inquiry be made if it were not so. And Fulk agrees. Afterwards at Bristol in the Quinzaine of Hilary, 13 Edw. I, (Jan 27, 1285), a Jury found that Lora gave Tud worth to Orabell and her heirs, so that Henry de Pembruge had held nothing there except in name of Orabell, once his wife. A day to hear sentence was given to the parties in the Quinzaine of Easter following. \" The whole of this last enrolment,\" adds the Record, \" is to be found in the Rolls of Hilary Term in the 13th year.\"99 Of Alice widow of Henry de Pembruge and her son Henry, I will attempt no further account, except to notice that she was living in 1300 and unsuccessful in a suit about lands in \" Brenchesle and Pepingbury (Co.

The whole Manor and income they estimated as worth \u00a320. 19s. 8|t.. yearly. They found Fulk, the son and heir, to have been four years old on Saturday August 27 previous.105 I presume that Isabel, widow of the deceased, had Tong in dower, for pursuant to the King's Writ dated at Portsmouth, May 24, 1297, the Sheriff of Shropshire returned Isabel Lady of Tong, among those who, holding lands or rents to the yearly value of \u00a320. or upwards, were (generally) liable to be summoned to perform military service in person, with horse and arms, in parts beyond the seas, and were to muster at London on July 7 following.106 In 4 Edw. II (1310-11), consistent mention is made of Fulk de Pembruge's heir as still under age. The King then intrusted his land to Oliver de Bordeaux till he should attain his majority.107 This last event will have been on August 27, 1312, and we have several notices of him during the fourteen years of his remaining life. On the 1st of April 1314, being at Stanton Harecourt (Oxford shire) , he acknowledges to have received from his Cousin, Monsieur de Harecourt, Lord of Bosworth, a Charter of the Manor of Tong, whereby Alan la Zouche gave and granted the same Manor to Sir William de Harecourt and Alice his wife in frank -marriage.108 On June 15, 1314, Fulk, son of Fulk Penebrugge, was a Knight.

It specifies free road for the Monks' sheep and animals, to be driven to and from their Grange of Rochlegh, to their pasture of Donyn tone, beyond the rivulet under Chelfesford, through Fulk's wood of Rochlegh ; also that the Monks may make a fence from the corner of their field of Rochlegh to the rivulet aforesaid ; also that they may make and maintain a bridge upon Fulk's land beyond the said rivulet and have easements of the bank of the said rivulet to repair said bridge when needful, as by the Charters of Roger, son of Alan la Zouche, and of Richard de Bealmeys is testified respecting the said bridge : also that, if at any time, from scarcity of their live stock, the Monks should neglect to use these liberties of road and bridge, it should not be to their prejudice or prevent them from reviving the dormant right when they chose; he also grants them a site for making a Mill at Tylesmendeslode-stank, with water-course and right of road through his land to the said mill, and earth to repair the stank when needful, \" as was contained in a fine levied in the Curia Regis about making the said Mill, between the Abbot of Buildwas and Alan de la Zouche formerly Lord of the Manor of Tonge.\"111 On 16 Oct. 1313, Fulk de Pembruge was included among those adherents of Thomas Earl of Lancaster who having participated in the death of Piers Gaveston had the King's pardon.

In 1333, Robert Corbet of Hadley and Matilda his wife had reco vered against Fulk son of Fulk de Pembruge, the Manor of Ayleston (Leicestershire) ,117 I presume Matilda, thus named, to have been Fulk's Mother, who, 112 Parliamentary Writs, iv, 1271. \"\u2022 Originalia, ii, 82.

I have seen no original documentary evidence which will enable me to state the descent from Fulk Pembruge III (living 1333) to Fulk IV who died in 1408-9. Shaw informs us of a Robert de Pembruge living in 20 Edw. Ill (1346-7), and whom Shaw takes to have been Brother and Heir of Fulk III, and Father of Fulk IV.118 The latter occurs in 1371, with Margaret his wife, daughter and eventual sole heir of William Trussel of Cublesdon, by his wife Ida (or Idonea) le Botyler.119 Margaret, first wife of Fulk de Pembruge IV, died without issue June 11, 1402. Fulk took a second wife, Isabel or Elizabeth Lingen, but dying without issue, in 10 Henry IV (1308-9), closed the male line of his succession at Tong. In 12 Hen. IV (1410-1) Isabel, relict of Fulk Pembruge, was busy in the Religious Foundation, since known as Tong College, the particulars of which are amply detailed elsewhere.120 Isabel long survived her first husband, long enough (as Shaw has it) to remarry twice, viz. to Sir Thomas Peytevine and Sir John Ludlow.131 She died in 25 Hen. VI (1446-7). The heir of the last Sir Fulk Pembruge of Tong was Richard de Vernon (sometimes called Richard de Pembruge). He was, if former accounts be correct, son and heir of Richard de Vernon, son and heir of another Richard de Vernon, by Juliana, sister of the said Fulk de Pembruge.133 All that I shall here add of this Richard de Vernon, thus succeeding to his supposed Great Uncle's estates after the death of Isabel, the said Great Uncle's surviving wife, is, that he was a Minor in 1402, a Knight in 1418, and that he died in 1451, seized of various Vernon and Pembruge estates, viz. Pyche cote (Bucks.), Harlaston (Staffordshire), Haddon (Derbyshire), Tong, Ayleston and Ullingwyke. 118 History of Staffordshire,!, Additions, seems to have arisen from the circum stance that Henry IV's charter of Nov. 1410, directed that the future Canons of Tong should pray for the souls (inter alios) of these two Knights. So the Dame Isabel would, at that rate, have got rid of three husbands in less than the same number of years. p. 38. 119 Dugdale (Baronage, p. 595) makes Ida le Botyler to be wife, not wife's Mother, of Fulk de Pembruge.

Distinct notice should however be taken of a younger branch of the family of De Belmeis, which had early feoffment in Tong and elsewhere, and is on the whole easily distinguishable from those other Cadets of the same house of whom we have given account under Donington. Whether William de Beaumeis who stands first witness of the very ancient deed quoted under Hatton were progenitor of the Tong or Donington branch, of both or of neither, I will not under take to say. \u2014 I only guess him to have been of Donington. I should be similarly doubtful as to that Robert de Belmeis, who about 1139 was first witness of Philip de Belmeis' grant to Buildwas: but the nearly contemporary deed of Richard de Belmeis (of Donington) seems to exclude Robert from that branch of the family. Therefore very possibly the said Robert was of Tong. Again I notice suggestively how the Deed of Philip de Belmeis Junior to Lilleshall, which passed between 1152 and 1159, is attested not only by Sir Richard de Belmeys (undoubtedly of Don ington) but by Robert de Belmeys and William his Brother. On the Staffordshire Pipe Roll of 1185, among some payments arising from a recent visit of the Justices of the Forest, it is entered that Robert de Belmes owes one merk, apparently for something sold out of the King's Forest.123 The same Justices holding pleas in Shropshire in the same year had further amerced Robert de Beaumes 20s-. for some default. \u2014 The latter fine he paid and was quit, but the former is renewed as an unsatisfied debt on the Staffordshire Pipe-Roll of 1186, with a note to the effect that payment should be required in Shropshire. However in 1187, he pays half-a-merk to the Sheriff of Stafford shire, the other half remaining a debt on the Staffordshire Rolls of 1188, 1189, 1190, 1191 ; but transferred to the Shropshire Roll of 1192, and liquidated in Shropshire in 1193.

In succession as I imagine to this Robert, was that Sir William de Beumys who has already been mentioned as having- given to John de Pres some feoffment in Tong Manor ;137 which feoffment, apparently granted in the first half of the thirteenth Century, was confirmed by Alan la Zouche between 1255 and 1263. In 1255, another Robert de Beaumes occurs under circumstances which leave no doubt of his being a vassal of the Lords of Tong. Such a person had obtained from Alan la Zouche the wardship of Ralph, son of Nicholas de Wililey, so far as related to a hide of land at Gretton (Munslow Hundred) ; which hide of land, as I shall elsewhere show, was held by De Wililey under La Zouche, and by La Zouche in capite of the King.138 Though I shall be somewhat interfering with the history of another locality, I should here state briefly that on Aug. 17, 1260, Giles de Erdinton was appointed specially to try a suit of novel desseizin which William, son of William le Fraunceys and Agnes his wife, had brought against Robert Beumys concerning a tene ment in Stanwey.129 On December 28, 1260, King Henry III granted his Letters- Patent of Protection in favour of Robert de Beumes, so long as the said Robert should be in the service of Prince Edward in parts beyond sea.130 On June 3, 1261, a Fine was levied at Westminster which indicates the purchase by Robert de Belmeis of half-a-virgate and one acre of land in Nether Stanwey, for which he paid ten merks to the Vendors.131 In 46 Hen. 3 (1261-2), the King granted to Robert de Belmeis 125 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

His heir, and, as I imagine, his Son, was Hugh de Belmeis, a youth whose loyal services to King Henry III are matters of frequent and honourable mention in the annals of the period. On Sept. 30, 1265, that is in the month following the great victory of Evesham, the King grants his Letters of Protection in behalf of Hugh de Beumes.133 In 1266, being one of that Monarch's Valets, he attended him at the siege of Kenilworth Castle, and, losing his two horses in that service, was recompensed for the same. The Sheriff of Shropshire, in 1268, charges ten merks which he had paid on this account to Hugh de Beaumes by Royal Warrant.134, On March 15, 1267, being at Cambridge with the King, Hughde Beaumes obtained the Royal License to hunt the fox, the badger, and the wild cat anywhere in the King's Forests of Shropshire or Staffordshire.135 In August 1267, the King being at Shrewsbury and various Pleas coming before him, Hugh de Beaumes was, with others, pro secuted about some right of common-pasture in Over and Nether Stanwey. Hugh amicably compounded his concern in the suit.136 On Sept. 19, the King, still at Salop, in recompense of the long and laudable service which his beloved Valet, Hugh de Beaumeys had rendered him, granted to said Hugh the marriage of Isabella widow of Robert de Beysyn, lately deceased, or at least the fine which belonged to the King for the said marriage.137 On January 20, 1270, two Fines were levied at Westminster which show Hugh de Beaumes intent upon increasing his property in the neighbourhood of Tong. The first, levied between the said Hugh as Plaintiff (by Stephen Fitz Henry Tateshale his Attorney) and Ranulf de Albrython and Alice his wife, Defendants, was of six acres in Donyngton, whereof was Plea of Warrantry.

On May 18, 1271, Hugh de Beaumes had the King's Charter, to him and his heirs, of the privilege of holding a Fair and Market in his Manor of Nether Stanwey.141 This Manor, with all his rights therein, he sold, within the next twenty years, to his con temporary and perhaps distant kinsman, John de Beaumeis Lord of Donington. On June 24, 1272, a Fine was levied at Lichfield between Hugh de Beaumes and Isolda his wife on the one hand, and William de Mer on the other. Hugh, for an annual rent of 40s., released, for the life of Isolda, to said William, all her demesne in Norton and Mer (Staffordshire) being her dower, also a third part of half-a-virgate of land and a meadow, held by John de Mer in Norton.

His liability arose doubtless in circumstances already alluded to, viz. in Stottesden Hundred, as Custos of certain lands of Robert de Beysin deceased, in Brim stree Hundred, as a Tenant at Donington and perhaps Albrighton. Between this period and the close of the Century, the name of Sir Hugh de Beaumes appears in connection with various Inquisi tions and Charters affecting lands in Brimstree Hundred. In October 1292, as a Knight and Juror, he tried several of those suits de quo waranto which were then pressed by the Crown against every class of Freeholders in Shropshire.143 Something I should also say about the larger interests of this Hugh de Beaumeis in Lincolnshire. In 1277, and preparatory to a Muster at Worcester against Llewellyn, which was fixed for July 1, he was returned as holding the township of Limberge (Lincolnshire) of the honour of Chester (then in the Crown) but by unknown services.144 For a similar Muster at Rhuddlan, fixed to take place on Aug. 5, 1282, he is returned under the same County, as ignorant of what service was due from him, but prepared, on being informed, to do it.145 For the Muster against the Scots, to take place at Carlisle on June 24, 1300, he was summoned in Lincolnshire, viz. as holding lands, whether in capite or otherwise, to the annual value of \u00a340. or upwards.146 This Tenure in capite, for such it really was, caused the usual Inquisitions to be holden as to his estate after his death. This event took place in 1305, when, on May 20, the King's writ of Diem clausit extremum issued to the Escheator. An Inquest held at Limbergh found that he held that vill in capite by service of half-a- Knight's-Fee, that the whole proceeds of the same were \u00a35. 7s., and that his son and next heir, Henry, was twenty-eight years of age and more. A second Inquest held at Lude Muchegros (Herefordshire) found that he had been Tenant for life of half that vill, holding it under the Western Border of Staffordshire, near Market Drayton.

A third Inquest taken at Albrighton on June 12, 1305, said that the deceased held in Donynton under John de Beumys by services of 18... and a pound of cumin; that he thus held a Capital messuage, a dove-cot, thirty acres of land, and one acre of Meadow : that he further held under John la Warre, Lord of Albrighton, forty acres of land by service of 8d. The age and name of his heir were returned as in the last Inquest.147 Henry de Beaumes, thus succeeding, seems by various lists of Jurors and Witnesses to have resided in this neighbourhood.148 I have already mentioned his name in such relation and shall content myself with one more notice of him and his succession. In Trinity Term 1329, a fine was levied at Westminster between John, son of Henry de Beaumes of Magna Lymbergh, and Tecia, daughter of Robert Fitz Peter of Magna Lymbergh, Complainants (querentes), through Hugh de Kilby her (Tecia's) Guardian, on the one part, and Henry de Beaumes of Magna Lymbergh, Deforciant, \u2014 of the Manor of Donynton whereof was plea of con vention. Henry conceded the same to John and Tecia, to hold to them and the heirs of their bodies under Henry and his heirs; rendering to them a Rose yearly at the feast of John Baptist's Nativity, and accustomed services to the Chief Lords of the Fee. Remainder was contingently reserved to Henry and his heirs.149 This Fine was in short a settlement and entail on the marriage of John de Beaumeis, son, and probably expectant heir, of Henry ; but how their interest in Donington came to be described as the Manor I cannot determine.

The matter stood thus in 1291 ; \u2014 The whole Temporalities of Buildwas, in the Archdeaconry of Salop and Diocese of Coventry, were returned as annually realizing an income of \u00a376. 12s. 3d.

The early history of Tong Church is as that of Donington. It was founded, endowed, and bestowed on Shrewsbury Abbey within eight years after Domesday , by Earl Roger de Montgomery. The transfer was sanctioned by the same succession of Royal Charters as have been mentioned under Donington. Also, as in the case of Donington, Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, held Tong Church under the Abbey for his life, and took care to restore it before his death.152 Furthermore the pension to which Shrewsbury Abbey was entitled from Tong Church was half-a-merk, and this pension was confirmed, first by the Charter of Bishop Roger dc Clinton, and afterwards, by Charters of his Diocesan Successors, and of more than one Archbishop of Canterbury.153 151 p0pe Nicholas1 Taxation, p. 260. 152 Supra, page 200. 153 See the authorities specified under Donington (supra, p. 166).

The Abbot might present one Clerk to the Incumbency or Parsonage, and another to the Pension, or he might present the same Clerk to both, or he might reserve the Pension to his House. These points as well as the Abbot's title to Tong Church are well illustrated by some legal proceedings between Roger la Zouche and Salop Abbey, in the course of which the following facts transpired. Between the years 1 188 and 1194, H (that is Hugh de Novant), Bishop of Coventry conceded and gave by Charter, to Ernulf, a Chaplain, the Church of Tong, \u2014 in pure almoigne, \u2014 to possess in perpetuity, \u2014 saving to the Bishop all rights Episcopal and Paro chial. This institution, as it afterwards appeared, was to the Parsonage as distinct from the Pension, and was on the presentation of Salop Abbey. William la Zouche, Lord of Tong, was not well-pleased with this proceeding. He expelled Ernulf from Tong and would not allow him to live there. Ernulf's expulsion lasted some time. Ernulf at length returned and continued to hold the Church all his life (.. e. till 1220, when he died), as Presentee of the Abbey, not as Roger, brother and heir of William la Zouche, afterwards affirmed, by gift of the said William. Meanwhile, that is between 1215 and 1220, William de CornhuU, Bishop of Coventry, at presentation of H (Hugh), Abbot of Salop, gave and conceded by Charter to Robert de Shireford, Clerk, the Church of Tong, saving the Vicarage therein of Ernulf, Canon of Lichfield, who was to pay a yearly pension of half-a-merk to the said Robert. \u2014 This was in fact an immediate institution only to the pension, a circumstance rendered still more clear by the words of Abbot Hugh's presentation, on receipt of which the Bishop instituted. Therein the Abbot conceded to Robert de Shireford half-a-merk out of the Church of Tong, viz. that half-merk which Ernulf, Clerk, Canon of Lichfield, had used to pay to the Abbey, and which puts the pension at 3s. 4a!., like that of Donington. This Charter contains so many points of identity with Bishop Roger de Clinton's Charter (Harl. MS3. 3868, so. 7 b), that I cannot doubt them to have been copied from the same original. If so, their few discrepancies are mere scribal errors. The Harleian Transcript is undoubtedly the more correct, and gives the pensions in ques tion as 6.. 8d. each."], [757, "249 TONG for remainder of Ernulf's life was to be paid to Shireford ; but after Ernulf's death, Shireford was to have the Church wholly (i.e. the Parsonage), and pay the pension, previously received by himself, to the Abbey. Therefore, on the whole, Robert de Shireford had been presented to the pension and to the reversion of the Incumbency, and Bishop Cornhull's institution must be taken to have sanctioned such a mode of presentation. On November 3, 1220, Ernulf, the Vicar and Parson, being lately dead, Roger la Zouche sued the Abbot of Shrewsbury, at Westminster, under writ of darrein presentment for the Advowson of Tong. The question in such trials was always \u2014 \" who presented the last Parson, then dead, to the vacant Church under litigation?\" In the present instance, the Abbot pleaded at once that the Church was not vacant, for Robert de Shireford was Parson. In proof of this, he produced Robert de Shireford in Court. Also Bishop Cornhull's Charter of Institution was exhibited, also Earl Roger's grant of the Advowson, and Henry II's Confirmation, and a Papal Bull, and Abbot Hugh's presentation. Roger la Zouche persisted that Ernulf, lately deceased, had been presented by William la Zouche, saving to the Abbot an annual pension, in name of benefice (nomine beneficii), and that the right of presentation to all else remained to him. \u2014 As Roger la Zouche asserted that Ernulf, now deceased, was the last Parson, the Court decided on an adjournment, and that that point should be referred to a Jury of Knights and other Freemen, who were summoned to attend at Westminster on Feb 3, 1221.154 The cause however was not finally decided till the County Assizes of November 1221. \u2014 The Abbot again produced the Charters of Earl Roger, King Henry II, and Bishop Cornhull. Roger la Zouche said that the two former Charters ought not to injure him, for that, since they passed, his Brother William had presented to the Church. He admitted that his Ancestors had charged Tong Church with half-a merk pension payable to Salop Abbey, and allowed that to such pension the Abbot might present any Clerk he pleased. He asserted again that Ernulf had been Parson, and had been admitted on presentation of his (Roger's) Brother. \u2014 The Abbot now produced the Charter of Bishop Hugh de Novant, 154 Placita apud Westm.

The latter decided that Ernulf, late Parson, had been pre sented by the Abbot and admitted on such presentation : they also found how Ernulf had been expelled for a time by William la Zouche and then suffered to return.155 In fact, I suppose that this return by permission of William la Zouche had caused Roger la Zouche's error, he identifying it with a presentation by William la Zouche. Be that as it may, the Court gave sentence that \" The Abbot do recover his Seizin and that Roger be in misericordid.\" In 1291, the Church of Tonge in the Deanery of Newport (Novi Burgi), the Archdeaconry of Salop, and Diocese of Coventry, was valued at \u00a3i., besides the Abbot of Shrewsbury Pension therein, which was put, as before, at 6s-. 8_..l5S In 1341, the Assessors and Vendors of the Ninth of wheat, wool/and lamb in Tong Parish, returned the proceeds at \u00a33. 6s. 8d. i. e. \u00a31. less than Pope Nicholas' Taxation of the Church. This low return, if I understand their statement, arose thus. \u2014 The Abbot of Buildwas held a carucate of land in the Parish (at Ruckley, I presume) which did not pay tithe, but, in lieu of tithe, three quarters of fine wheat (which I infer was all he could be charged to the Ninth) :157 \u2014 also the Abbot of Lilleshull had a carucate of land here (Lizard Grange), and paid 3s. id. only thereon, in lieu of tithe; also the small-tithes, glebe-land, oblations, tithes of Mills, and other profits went to make up the greater sum (the taxation), and did not pertain to the Ninth now granted to the King.158 When Isabel, Widow of Sir Fulke de Pembruge, proposed to found the Collegiate Church of Tong she procured in the first instance the Royal License to purchase the Advowson from Salop Abbey. \u2014 King Henry IV's Patent, dated Nov. 25, 1410, enabled her so to do, calling the Church that of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and 155 Salop Assizes, 6 Hen.

He deducted only 4s. per annum, payable out of the Church to the Diocesan Bishop, 2s. Senage payable to the same, and 8s. Procurations payable to the Archdeacon of Salop.100 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Ernulf, Chaplain, and afterwards a Canon of Lichfield, has already been mentioned as instituted to this Church between 1188 and 1194. On his death in 1220, Robert de Shireford, Clerk, entitled by a previous grant to the reversion of the Parsonage, succeeded, not however without question, till November 1221, when his title to do so was established in the Secular Courts. William, Parson of Tong, was in 1255 reported by the Jurors of Brug as having impleaded Walter de Ingworthin, a Layman, before a spiritual Court, and having got from him 10s. because said Walter would not sell him boots to his wish.161 The first Incumbent on the Diocesan Register is : \u2014 Robert de Atterley, Rector of Tonge, who has a two years license to study on May 9, 1308. He has occurred to us under Donington in 1324. On May 30, 1334, he has leave of five months non- residence on the score of ill health (causa, medicin\u00e6) ; and on Jan. 29, 1335 he proposes to exchange benefices with \u2014 Master William de Kynardeseye, Acolyte, late Rector of St. Mary's, Bristol, who is admitted to Tong by the Bishop of Worcester on Feb. 4 following. On April 13, 1351, this Rector has a year's leave of non-residence ; and again on July 15, 1354, at instance of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. On Jan. 9, 1355, he is negotiating an exchange of benefices with \u2014 Sir Robert Alewy, late Rector of Farnebergh (Dioc. Bath and Wells), who is admitted here on Jan. 19 by the Bishop of Bath and 159 Monasticon, viii, p. 1402. 160 Valor Ecclesiasticus, iii, 189, 196. 161 Rot. Hund. ii, 59.

Tong Church, which consists of a nave with aisles, a Chancel, and a central octagonal tower with a low spire, was principally built during the reign of Henry IV, and is a pure and beautiful example of the Early Perpendicular. To this date also belongs the south porch, and the vestry attached to the north side of the Chancel. But a Chapel on the south side, forming a sort of tran sept, was added during the latest period of Gothic, and has a rich fan vaulting, all the other roofs of the Church being timber. I gave a notice of this Church in the second volume of the ' Arch\u00e6olo gical Journal,' but at the time I wrote it, I had not remarked some earlier features which appear in the south aisle, in the shape of labels of arches, with their corbels or brackets, and the capitals of the piers. These lead me to suspect that the face of the arcade now looking to the south aisle, originally faced the nave of an older building, the north aisle of which would fall into the area of the present nave; \u2014 for a greater amount of ornament would naturally be introduced in the side facing the central passage, than in that towards the aisle ; that is, if any difference between the two was made. At any rate, a part of the present structure, however small, may be referred to the thirteenth century. J. L. Petit. OLD MONUMENT. I have already descended far later than my usual limits in order that I might trace the History of Tong down to the extinction of the male line of Pembruge and the foundation of the Collegiate Church by the Widow of the last of that House. Many temptations there are to descend yet later, \u2014 a brilliant succession of Knights and Nobles who continued to inherit or 162 Lichfield Registers."], [761, "TONG CHURCH"], [762, ""], [763, "SOUTH AISLE OF TONG CHURCH."], [764, ""], [765, "CORBEL, SOUTH AISLE, TONG."], [766, ""], [767, "MONUMENT OF SIR RICHARD VERNON AND WIFE (at supposed), TONG CHURCH"], [768, ""], [769, "TONG 253 possess the Lordship, a Church well known in the present day as a model of its class, also a series of Monuments such as can be found in few edifices of equal scale and pretension.163 To one of these Monuments, the oldest and perhaps the fairest of the series, I will at least extend my remarks, associated as it is with the era to which I have already descended, and because some curiosity exists as to the persons whom it was intended to com memorate. Sir William Dugdale, visiting Tong Church in September 1663, notices this Monument as follows ; \u2014 \" Towards the North side of the Church stands a faire Tombe of Alabaster whereon do lye the figures of a man in armour (partly male and partly plate armour) and of his wife on his right hand, and on her chin a Wimpler. Upon the Helm whereon the man resteth his head is this Crest (upon a Wreath) viz. a Turkish woman's head with a wreath about her temples ; her haire platted and hanging below her shoulders, with a tassel at the end of the platting. \u2014 \" This iss ayde to be the monument of Sir Fowke Pembrugge Knight, sometime Lord of Tonge Castle.\"164 This Tradition still exists, and, if it be true, the Monument comes fairly within our scope as the tomb of Sir Fulk Pembruge, the last of his line, who died in 1408-9, and of one of his wives. His Widow was within the next three years active in founding the Collegiate Structure which we now know as Tong Church. 163 One of these Monuments is embel lished by an ornament higher than archi tecture or heraldry could supply \u2014 a verse (its epitaph) written by Shakespeare. I may hardly thus aUude to it without giving it. It is as foUows : \u2014 - of the Poet's genius; for Sir Thomas Stanley, to whose memory it was written, died in December 1576, when Shakespeare was not yet thirteen years of age. The opposite, or eastern, end of this tomb exhibits six verses which I cannot help thinking to have been in imitation of the former and by an inferior Poet. Possibly also they are in praise of Sir Edward Stanley (son of Sir Thomas), to whose memory the Monument is in part devoted, for they speak of one who \" lyes here,\" that is, was buried beneath. Now Sir Thomas Stanley is said to have been buried, not at Tong, but at Walthamstow (Essex).\u2014 \"Not Monumental Stone preserves our fame, Nor sky-aspiring Pyramids our name ; The Memory of him for whom this stands Shall outlive marble andDefacers' hands ; When all to Time's consumption shall be given, Stanley, for whom this stands, shall stand in Heaven.\" These verses are not worth transcribing. Sir WiUiam Dugdale, in his Visitation of Shropshire, says positively that this epitaph was written by Shakespeare. Probably however it was an early effort 164 Dugdale's Visitation of Shropshire at the Heralds' College; Church Notes, p. 18. 33 II."], [770, "254 TONG A strong probability therefore arises that the earliest Monument in a Church of this Lady's building should be to the memory of herself and her deceased husband. Some opinions which I have taken as to the date of this Monu ment, and which were grounded on its details of architecture and costume, are not very positive, but not inconsistent with the idea that it was Sir Fulk Pembruge's.165 Thus much for one view of the matter, and now for another. \u2014 Fulk Eytone, Armiger, a member of the family of Eyton on the Wildmoors, having apparently been serving in the French wars of Henry VI's time, directs by his Will that he shall \" be intombed by his Godfather Sir Fouk de Pembrudge in our Lady Chappell of Tonge.\"166 Now the person whose burial-place is thus indicated must neces sarily be that Sir Fulk Pembruge who died in 1408-9 ; and as it is not very probable that the Lady-Chapel of Tong was in the North Transept of the Church ; 167 so it is unlikely that Sir Fulk Pem bruge was buried in that Transept. But as the relative position of \" The Lady-Chapel\" was not invariable, we will strengthen this doubt still further. \u2014 I again quote Dugdale who continues his notice of this Monu ment as follows ; \u2014 \" On the sides of this Tombe are divers Escocheons whereon Armes have been antiently depicted : but I suppose it was since the Vernons became Lords of Tonge Castle by marriage with the heire female of Pembrugge, for the painting is as followeth.\" Dugdale then gives, as beneath, the bearings of twelve shields, to 165 There is always some uncertainty in judging from these indicia, e.g. aU Coun ties cannot be supposed to have advanced in parallels of Architectural fancy : some tombs were constructed during the lives of the persons whom they were intended eventuaUy to commemorate, others again were buUt long after their decease. So too as to the Armour and Dress of monu mental Effigies; \u2014 an older fashion than the one in vogue might very possibly be adopted in some cases, for aged people cling to the customs of their earlier life, and would naturaUy, if directing the order of their future burial, give instruc tions in accordance with such feelings. And in ease of a monument erected to the memory of one long deceased, it is impos sible to say what anachronisms of costume might not have been adopted. For these or some similar reasons, I suppose it comes to pass that those who should be most adequate to form an opi nion as to the date of a given biulding or monument will seldom express a very definite one. 166 Lansdowne MS. 860 A, so. 370 b. 167 The Lady Chapel in large Churches was usually at the East, behind the High Altar.

These coats are not all which the tomb has or once had ; but some others, still to be recognized, are repetitions of Nos. vi and xi; others again are wholly defaced and were apparently so in Dugdale's time. Now, notwithstanding one or two difficulties in accounting for each of these insignia, it is clear on the whole that the tomb is that of a Vernon. If compared also with the annexed Pedigree it will further appear I think, that it is the tomb of Sir Richard Vernon, Treasurer of Calais, who died in 1451, and of his wife Benedicta de Ludlow.169 This Sir Richard Vernon was the first of his line who inherited the estates and arms of Pembruge, and who, on one occasion at least, bore the name of Pembruge also. If he were commonly called Sir Richard Pembruge (and we do not know to the contrary) then the Tradition about the Tomb instead of being disproved has only been explained and corrected. Arms were either not known or else were omitted. 168 This I take to be the significant coat of the series. It must be that of Sir Richard Vernon, who died in 1451. The Pembruge Arms are assigned to him as Heir of Pembruge. Empaled therewith are the Arms of his first, but perhaps not only, wife, Benedicta de Ludlow. He married, I presume, a second wife, whose 169 No one, I presume, will undertake to say that Sir Fulk Pembruge's Widow emblazoning his tomb after his decease would add thereto the insignia of his ap parent heirs, omitting her own arms (Lin gen) and those of his first wife (Trussel)."], [772, "256 TONG Before I leave this Tomb another curious circumstance, in probable connection therewith, should be told. \u2014 A Tourist visiting Tong Church towards the close of the eighteenth Century, after mentioning the Monuments, says that he \"noticed one of Alabaster to the memory of a Vernon. The effigies,\" he continues, \"lie on an altar-tomb and had the remains of a garland of flowers (then nearly reduced to dust) round the neck and breast. The Sexton told me that on every Midsummer day (June 24), a new garland was put on and remained so until the following, when it was annually renewed. As this is a singular custom, I could not forbear noticing it, and wish to be informed what was the origin of it.\" l;o My Brother Antiquary's inquiring spirit is ere this at rest, and, though the custom which he describes is now disused, others may care to hear a suggestion as to its origin. \u2014 When Roger la Zouche, between the years 1227 and 1237, enfeoffed Henry de Hugford in lands at Tong (as before recited) the only acknowledgment reserved was \" a Chaplet of Roses payable to the Grantor and his Heirs upon the Feast day of the Nativity of St. John Baptist (June 24), in case he or they should be at Tong; if not, then to be put upon the Image of the Blessed Virgin in the Church of Tonge.\" We have seen this quit-rent to have been payable to Fulk de Pembruge (who died in 1296) among his other receipts in Tong Manor ; we now, as I think, see it either paid, or commemorated, six centuries later ; no longer indeed appended to the Image of the Virgin, which was of course removed in the sixteenth Century, but placed instead on the earliest Monument of the Manorial Lords which the Church happened to contain. The Windows of the Collegiate Church of Tong were formerly embellished with armorial insignia. These deserve notice, some of them as illustrating the ascertained history and alliances of the houses of Pembruge and Vernon, others as suggesting further genealogical truths. Dugdale, in 1663, observed the following shields in the South Windows of the Chancel. \u2014 i.

Having now completed our Survey of the ancient Hundred of Alnodestreu, we proceed to classify those various detachments of other Counties and Hundreds which, at the time of Domesday, lay intermixed with, or adjacent to, the Manors of Alnodestreu, or else have been since annexed to those Hundreds (Brimstree and Stottesden) which mainly represent Alnodestreu. The foregoing Table presents this series in a succinct form, and, when compared with the Map already given, will indicate the pro posed plan of our further investigations. It is not however my intention to give any detailed account of Hales Owen. That Manor is no longer a part of Shropshire, and its anomalous position has already procured for it the notice of the Historian of its proper County, Worcestershire.1 Its former connection with Shropshire demands however this passing mention, and I insert its name in the annexed Table not merely for the sake of completeness, but because it will serve to illustrate some remarks which I have to offer with respect to these eccentric divisions of territory, 2 \u2014 their causes, meaning, and objects. Dugdale, speaking of a part of Worcestershire, which in his time was isolated in Warwickshire, says as follows ; 3 \u2014 \" Before I go farther, it will not be amisse to give some probable reason (for apparent proof I have none) why this, and such parcells so encompassed (as is frequently seen) became thus severed from the Counties wherein they lye ; which, in short, I conceive to be no more than this ; viz. that they being originally (I mean before the division of Counties was absolutely made and settled) belonging to some great person, whose residence was far distant ; and in the old assessments rated there, continued afterwards so taxt ; and for that respect have been, and are still reputed part of those Shires. And that this was the first ground thereof, will be evident enough from the instances that might be given therein, through sundry parts of this Realm, as in this particular here before us ; \" Dugdale then proceeds to show how certain Worcestershire Manors, surrounded in his time by Warwickshire, had anciently belonged to the Church of Worcester, or to the Monastery of Pershore, and 1 Nash, vol. i, pp. 508, 535. 2 Supra, Vol. I, p. 17. 3 History of Warwickshire (Thomas's Edition), vol. i, p. 628."], [777, "261 MANORS AND DISTRICTS. how they had continued to be parts of Worcestershire, notwith standing all subsequent territorial arrangements. Mr. Blakeway, commenting upon and assenting to this doctrine of Dugdale's, quotes a passage of Ordericus to show how it was \" in the power of any great man to throw his estates into whatever district he pleased.\"4 \u2014 The transfer, thus alluded to by Mr. Blakeway, belongs to the provincial history of Normandy, early in the eleventh century, and only exhibits instances where certain Nobles submitted their terri tories to a specific and comparatively distant Episcopal supervision, not to any secular jurisdiction.6 Their object was clearly to escape all imperative control whatever. Nevertheless the case is well cited by Mr. Blakeway ; for an analogy of motives is observable in all such transfers whether ecclesiastical or temporal. We may now consult the annexed Table to see how far these observations of Dugdale and Blakeway bear upon our own immediate subject. \u2014 It will be observed that four names are prominently connected with the Domesday Manors therein enumerated. They are Earl Roger, Ralph de Mortimer, Roger de Lacy, and Robert Fitz Tetbald. Now each of these was \" a great man,\" and doubtless the peculiar status which then or afterwards was obtained for their respective Manors had its object. They either had in view the concentration of their own jurisdictions, or else an escape from all superior or coordinate interference. Thus I presume that Mortimer, Lacy, and Fitz Tetbald procured their Manors to be registered in the Domesday Hundred of Baschurch ; not because they themselves had any other and para mount interest in that Hundred, but to escape being classified with those ordinaiy Tenants of Earl Roger, who owed suit and service to Alnodestreu. Thus too Roger de Lacy, being Tenant in capite, and not Earl Roger's Tenant at Cleobury-North, will have had a still stronger motive for keeping that Manor in an isolated condition. These, however, are instances where boundaries of Hundreds only were affected. As regards the limits of Counties the cases under notice present a totally distinct feature. Four Manors in Staffordshire and one in Worcestershire, which had been originally in those Counties, and which Earl Roger and Hugh his Son held almost wholly in demesne, retained at Domesday their ancient status. 4 Stottesdon Parochial History, Tit. j 5 Liber, iii, p. 464, A, B. Farlow. I n. 34"], [778, "262 COSFORD. The obvious convenience of attaching them to Shropshire was not yet recognized. It came however to be seen, and probably soon after Domesday. The change then, in this instance, was not based upon prescription or the authority of Domesday, but was brought about afterwards ; its object being evidently to give integrity to the Palatine Earldom of Shropshire. The last and most curious case is that of the four Domesday Manors which, being locally in Staffordshire at that period, are yet exhibited in Warwickshire. These were not held by Earl Roger in demesne, but by his Tenants, one of whom I identify with Ralph de Mortimer. It is again clear that the said Tenants were interested in dis uniting these Manors, not only from the Manors of Earl Roger's demesne, wherewith they were intermixed, but also from the yet more alien Staffordshire Hundred of Saisdone : they therefore procured them to be recognized as in Warwickshire. A combina tion with any nearer jurisdiction or district would have been to the disadvantage of these Manors. They would in fact have constituted an hundredal minority. Summarily then there were cases where the isolation of a Manor added to its importance ; there were also cases, where a Manor, already isolated, might profit by being annexed to some distant jurisdiction where its Lord was already paramount. Cosforti* The etymology of this name is more traceable in the older ways of spelling it than in that which is now current. \u2014 Gopj-tej- Fopb (Gorstes-ford) or \" The ford of gorse \" is a term relevant both to the shallow stream, which flows hereby, and to the nature of the soil, which in this quarter is favourable to the shrub thus indicated. Domesday says that \" Radulfus (de Mortemer) holds Costeford (of Earl Roger) . Turgot held it (in time of King Edward) and was a free man. Here is one hide geldable. There is (arable) land suf ficient for in ox-teams. In demesne there is one (such team). In time of King Edward it was worth xls. (per annum) ; afterwards it was waste ; now it is worth \\s.\" (per annum) } This small Manor introduces to our notice one of the greatest names which occur in the Shropshire Domesday. The connection of Mortimer with Cosford was however very transient, and we must 1 Domesday, so. 257 a, 1."], [779, "263 COSFORD. postpone our account of that extraordinary race till we reach some locality more associated with its fortunes.fr A probable reason should meanwhile be given why this and some other Manors, held by Mortimer at Domesday, appear at no subsequent period in the hands of his Successors. \u2014 I have already suggested (under Ryton) how an outlying Manor might be a mere incumbrance to a great Fief, and so be surrendered by its Tenant as a matter of policy. I have further imagined that some involuntary loss may have befallen those who shared in the rebellion of 1088. Either consideration will apply to Ralph de Mor timer's tenure of Cosford ; for it was isolated from all his other possessions, and he shared prominently in that rebellion. In short, the very name of Mortimer implies turbulent restlessness and never sated ambition, alternate honour and disgrace, the greatest ascend ancy succeeded by the most utter ruin. Besides this case of Cosford, I shall hereafter notice other early dismemberments of Mortimer's Fief, and one which must have happened within thirteen years of Domesday, \u2014 that is before the death of Earl Hugh de Montgomery in 1098. Cosford, after its separation from the Fief of Mortimer, seems to have been annexed to that Tenure in capite which the Pichfords enjoyed in the neighbouring Manor of Albrighton. Richard de Pichford, before the year 1176 (when he was de ceased), granted to Buildwas Abbey \"all the service of Richard Crasset, of the land of Cospelford.\" Such is the Record of a Charter of King Richard I, dated at Winchester, October 22, 1189.3 But another Charter of the same King, dated in the first instance on October 20, 1189, and after wards renewed at Roche- Andely on October 24, 1198, speaks of the same or other land acquired by the Monks at Cosford in a different way.

Again, we have seen Henry Crasset standing last witness, about 1248, to Robert Traynel's grant of Hatton to Buildwas, and finally we have William Crasset in 1272, suing the Abbot of Buildwas for his Manor of Hatton, which appears at that time to have comprehended two Townships, one called Hatton Traynel, the other Hatton Crasset.5 Thus from the time of Turgod the Saxon, who held, as I have already concluded, both Cosford and Hatton before the Conquest, two Centuries had elapsed; \u2014 two centuries during which nearly every notice of one Manor is either directly or indirectly associated with the other. Now at length both belonged to Buildwas Abbey, whose specific interests in Cospeforde were thus estimated in 1291, viz. two carucates of land worth annually (at 10s. each carucate) \u00a31. Os. Od. \u2014 Annual profits of Stock \u00a36. is. 6d. \u2014 Two Mills annually worth \u00a31. Os. Od? In 1341, as we have seen under Albrighton, the Abbot of Buildwas is said to hold three carucates in Albrighton Parish. I know however of nothing which he had therein except Cosford ; but these estimates are very often thus irreconcilable, and can be taken to prove little more than that the returns and assessments of that period were either made very carelessly or very dishonestly. In 1535-6, Stephen, last Abbot of Buildwas declared his Rents derived from \" Gofford \" to be \u00a33. per annum, from Abrighton 2s. 4?d., whilst he paid the Prior of Wenlock 12s. per annum for Common near Gofforde, and 10s. to the Vicar of Albrighton for ad ministering the Sacraments in Gofforde.7 The Ministers' -Accounts, a year later, give \u00a33. as the ferm of Gosforde Grange, and 4d. as the ground-rent of a Mill there.8 quoted by me, is as follows : \u2014 \" I, William, son of John Bagoth, have conceded to the Abbot and Convent of Buldewas the whole Convention which was made between them and my Father about the land which is beyond the Rivulet, from the boundaries of Westune to the boundaries of Broctune.

In the case before us we have however a statement on the point ; and? most significant that statement is. \u2014 Iteshale, once an estate of Morcar Earl of Mercia, and ordinarily a Manor of \u00a315. annual value, was worth no more than 6s. per annum, at the said period of transfer. The rebellion and fate of Earl Morcar in 1071, have already been alluded to. We have here another feature of the same tragedy, viz. the almost utter desolation which visited his lands and dependants. To this, then recent, state of disorganization, I must attribute the silence of Domesday as to a Collegiate Church which doubtless had existed here in Saxon times,3 and which will have been re-established by the Norman Lord very soon after the period of that Survey. 1 It is probable that the names Idsall and Shiffnal originally represented two districts lying respectively West and East of the small stream which divides the Town. Each however has, in its turn, served to describe the whole place. The name Schuffenhale, as that of the vill, first occurs to me in a deed of 1320 ;.but deeds of that and four following centiries speak of the \" Lordship, Manor, Fee; and Church of Idsall,\" sometimes adding \"alias Shiffnall,\" sometimes not.

We must now speak of Robert Fitz Tetbald, who receiving this dilapidated Manor and Church from Earl Roger, seems to have restored both. He had in 1085 three other Shropshire Manors, viz. Kemberton, Woodcote, and one whose extent was very small, and whose name is unrecorded. He is mentioned in authentic documents not only as a witness to part of Earl Roger's endowment of Shrewsbury Abbey, but the Earl himself names him as one of his Coadjutors in that pious work. \"Robert son of Theobald,\" says the Earl, \"gave them (the Monks) the Church of Iteshale with the tithes of the same vill.\" * This grant seems to have been increased, or more fully specified, during the time of Earl Hugh or Earl Robert, who are said to have confirmed the grant which \" Robert Fitz Thetbalt, Vicecomes, made of the tithe of Cambriston (Kemberton), and the Church of Ithessal with all things pertaining thereto, and with the tithe of the same Manor, viz. in monies, and in animals, and in crops.\" 6 Rothbert Vicecomes, or Robert Fitz Theobald next appears, both as a witness of the genuine, and an alleged witness of the more suspected Charters of Earl Hugh to Shrewsbury Abbey. There is, I think, no probability that his jurisdiction as Vicecomes was in Shropshire. \u2014 Of that however presently. He does not appear to have been involved in the fall of Earl Robert de Belesme, for Richard Bishop of London (consecrated July 1108) is said to have attested a grant, whereby Robert Vicecomes, son of Tedbald, not only repeated his donations to Shrewsbury, but directed that, as fast as the Clerks (that is Canons) who were then in possession of the Church of Ithesal should die off, the Church should come into the demesne of St. Peter.6 Thus far of Robert Fitz Tetbald, as connected with Shropshire. I must now speak of him in a much more important relation, hitherto unnoticed by local Historians. The Domesday Survey of Sussex presents Robert Fitz Tetbald 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 2. 5 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. 6 Monasticon, iii, 518. \" Et quia eandem ecelesiam tune clerici habebant, precepit isdem Robertus, ut cum illi morerentur, ecclesia in dominio Saneti Petri venirct.\" This was an exact imi- tation of Earl Roger's dealing with regard to Morville.

The same Robert Fitz Tetbald is described as holding the large Sussex Manor of Treverde (Trayford) under the Earl.7 The same person, easily recognized under his Christian name Robertus, further appears as Tenant of more than thirty Manors in the Honour of Arundel. Being thus by far the greatest Feoffee in Roger de Montgomery's Earldom of Arundel and Chichester, it was doubtless in this relation, that Robert Fitz Tetbald acquired his title of Vicecomes, though his Shrievalty is nowhere noticed in Domesday, and perhaps had not then commenced. It will answer a present as well as a future purpose, if I give a summary of Robert Fitz Tetbald's Sussex Fief. \u2014 It included Peteorde (Petworth), Cochinges (Cocking), Heriedeham (Hardham), and a number of Manors which constituted that integral portion of the Earldom of Arundel known afterwards as the Honour of Petworth. It also included Poleberge (Pulborough) and Garinges (Goring).8 I have already cited evidence to show that Robert Fitz Tetbald did not share the fall of Earl Robert de Belesme in 1102. His Fief both in Sussex and Shropshire will accordingly have been held after that event under King Henry I. It is however clear that during that Monarch's life the whole lapsed to the Crown, but whether by surrender, forfeiture, or failure of heirs, I cannot determine. The Honours of both Earl and Vicomte were thus at the redisposal of King Henry. The estates of Robert Fitz Tetbald do not however appear to have been granted to any Subject during that Monarch's reign ; for the Feodary of the Honour of Arundel (which I have already determined to belong to the period between 1130 and 1135) enumerates the following Tenures and Fees without naming any Tenant. \" Pettewrtha \u2014 22\u00a3 fees, Garinges \u2014 11 fees, Poleberga \u2014 3 fees, and Trieferda \u2014 1 fee.\"9 Thus at the close of Henry I's reign, was the Fief of Robert Fitz Tetbald in the King's hand. I shall hereafter have to trace its subsequent history in connection with Shropshire names and estates.

Earldom of Arundel, estimated at eight Knights'-Fees, had been placed at the disposal of the King. This he had granted to Alan de Dunstanvill, who was then holding the same. He had also, if I mistake not, granted to the same Alan the Shropshire Manor of Idsall. And here, in attempting to declare who this Alan de Dunstan vill was, I must undertake the history of a great Feudal Barony, the early par-t of which was left unexplored by Dugdale, and has only been misrepresented by others. BARONY OF DUNSTANVILL. In the Wiltshire Domesday, one Humphrey de Lisle (Humfridus de Insula) is recorded as holding of the King a Fief of not less than twenty-seven Manors. Of these it will suffice for our present purpose to name the following, viz. Broctone, Contone, Sterte, Cumbrewelle, WTili, Colerne, Poltone, Bedestone, Come, and Wintreburne.10 Of this Humphrey de Lisle, I can say no more than that in January 1091, he was in attendance at Hastings on King William II, then about to embark for Normandy.11 He appears to have left a daughter and sole heiress, variously called Adelina de Insula, and Adeliza de Dunstanville, for it was the custom of great heiresses to retain their paternal names after marriage. The husband of Adelina de Insula was Reginald de Dunstanville, whose marriage of so wealthy an heiress bespeaks some Court influence, but of whose origin I can form no conjecture. The name is associated with the liaisons of Royalty, but certain it is that this Reginald was deceased before his great namesake the illegitimate son of Henry I, and afterwards Earl of Cornwall, had passed the age of boyhood. This Reginald, under the name of Rainald de Dunestanesvill, gave to the Priory of Lewes the Church of Winterburne in Wiltshire with all that appertained thereto.1- Now as Winterburne was among the Domesday possessions of Humphrey de Lisle, so will the various confirmations which Lewes Priory had of this Church enable us to judge of his succession. 111 Domesday, fos. 70, b 2, and 71, a 1. 11 Monasticon, viii, 1294; ii.

Adelina de Insula, wife of Reginald de Dunstanvill survived him. In her widowhood and yet previous to the year 1 1 24, she granted to Tewkesbury Abbey the land of Poltone for the soul of the said Reginald her husband.13 She appears also on the Wilt shire Pipe-Roll of 1130, under the name of Adeliza de Dunestanvill as Surety for one who owed ten merks to the Crown.14, She further seems, by a document which I shall quote presently, to have made some grant or confirmation of Winterbourae Church to Lewes Priory. In 1130, there was one Reginald de Dunstanvill who had a very large property in Wiltshire, whose Sister Gundred had also lands there, and who both seem to have been high in Royal favour.15 If this Reginald was in the succession of Humphrey de Lisle, I can say nothing further of him. If, as, notwithstanding some evidence to the contrary, I must believe, he was identical with Reginald Fitz Roy, then I have no present concern with him. In the succession of Adeliza de Dunstanvill came one Walter de Pinkney. Whether he were her heir (the son of a former husband), or whether his claims superseded those of others in consequence of his siding with the dominant political party of his day, I can hardly determine. The following evidences are all I have to offer on the point.- \u2014 \u25a0 In or about the year 1145, this Walter, having been left by Stephen as Governor of the garrison of Malmesbury, was dis tinguished for his fidelity to the Usurper, and his readiness in 13 Monatticon, ii, pp. 66, 86. Polton, near Marlborough (Wilts), continued to belong to Tewkesbury till the Dissolution. It was a Domesday Manor of Humphrey de Insula. Adelina's grant thereof was confirmed by Henry I, apparently when at East-Bourne (Sussex), and certainly before 1124. 14 Rot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, p. 21. 15 He is excused \u00a37.1*. of the Danegeld assessed on Wiltshire. His liability to such a sum indicates a large property. Several Hundreds in the same County were also under amercement, for murders committed within their limits ; \u2014 but a sum of 40*. chargeable on Reginald, and one of 24s. chargeable on his Sister Grun dred, in that respect, had been excused by Royal favour. Similarly 24s. of the Danegeld assessed on the County of Surrey had been excused to Reginald de Dunestanvill (Rot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, pp. 22, 51). The doubt about this Regi nald being Reginald Fitz Roy arises thus : \u2014 William of Jumieges, writing apparently between the years 1135 and 1140, speaks of Reginald Fitz Roy as \" adhuc juvenis et sine casamento\" (still a youth and without territorial provision). Never theless Reginald Fitz Roy was fighting for the cause of the Empress, in Coutanee, in 1138 ; and there are other reasons for thinking that Henry I's illegitimate chil dren were all born at an earlier period than the Monk of Jumieges' account would imply ( Vide,\u2014 JFi. lelmus Gemmeticensis, p. 306; and Ordericus, p. 915 ;\u2014 inter Normannorum Scriptores). 35 it."], [788, "270 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. the field. Falling however into the hands of William Peverel de Dover, an equally zealous supporter of Matilda, he was given up to the latter. Neither persuasions nor threats would induce the captive to cooperate in a scheme which the Empress entertained of obtaining possession of Malmesbury-Castle through his agency. He would not and could not further her design, for Stephen, hearing of his captivity, came to Malmesbury himself and took measures for its future defence. The Empress, cruel in her dis appointment, consigned Walter de Pinkney to chains and a dungeon.16 It must have been two years afterwards, that Walter de Pinkney (Pinchenei) escaping from prison flew again to arms. Backed by the assistance of Boger Earl of Hereford and an efficient band of soldiers, he got possession of Christ-Church (Hants), a Castle then garrisoned for the Empress. His conduct was now marked by violent extortion, sacrilege, and the most wanton cruelties. A combination of the Citizens of Christ-Church and the neighbouring tenantry resolved to put an end to his barbarities. Passing, as it seems, from the Castle to the Church, he and his suit were waylaid by the conspirators, who in the first instance addressed him as suppliants deprecating his extortionate conduct. The answer they received was a defiant look, and a threat of yet harsher treatment. The look and the threat were the last; \u2014 in another moment Walter de Pinkney fell lifeless under the stroke of a battle-axe, his followers were put to the sword, and the Castle of Christ-Church surrendered to the Conspirators.17 This Walter had in his life-time, and probably before his imprisonment, expedited a Charter to Lewes Priory of which the following is a translation. To the Venerable Lord Prior of Lewes, &c., Walter de Pencheni, greeting. Know ye that I give ye, the Church of Wintreburne, which _ny Mother 18 (materna mea) Adeliza gave ye ; I give it after the decease of the Clerk my kinsman (clerici, parentis mei) to whom I granted it, and as long as that Clerk shall live, he shall hold it of ye, and he shall pay ye every year, whilst the War shall last, 10s., and when God shall have given peace, he shall pay one merk of silver.

These were the two Brothers Robert and Alan de Dunstanvill, the former of whom, dying in course of time without issue, left his estates to the children of his younger Brother. The latter, Alan, having in the first instance no paternal inheritance, seems to have obtained certain grants in Sussex and Shropshire, which I have already ascribed to the favour of Henry I. I will first speak of Robert de Dunstanvill, and endeavour to show by his attestation of various Charters how true he was to the cause of the Empress and her Son Henry. On July 25, 1141, it must be he, who as Robert Fitz Reginald witnessed that famous Charter whereby the Empress, grateful for a temporary success, created Milo de Gloucester Earl of Hereford.20 This Charter passed at Oxford, as did two others nearly contemporary, one to Geoffrey Earl of Essex, and one to St. Benet's of Hulm (Norfolk) . The first of these is attested by Robert Fitz Reginald, the other by Robert Fitz Reg : probably the same person.31 About the same time, but at Devizes (Wiltshire), and as Robert de Dunstanvill, he attests two Charters which the Empress ex pedited in favour of Shrewsbury Abbey.22 Another Charter of the Empress dated at Devizes, and granting to the Monks of Radmore (Staffordshire) has the same attestation.33 In 1153, he attests a Charter which Henry, as yet only Duke of Normandy and Earl of Anjou, granted to Bristol Abbey : 3* but on that Prince's accession to the throne, he appears constantly at Court both in England and Normandy, at the siege of Brug also in 1155, and attesting charters which passed then and after wards to the Shropshire Houses of Shrewsbury and Haughmond, and to the Flintshire Abbey of Basingwerc.

In this same fiscal year, he had had a grant from the King of the Royal Manor and Hundred of Heytesbury (Wiltshire), reputed to pay a blanch ferm of _\u00a340. per annum to the Exchequer.25 The Sheriff of Wiltshire, till September 1167, annually deducted that sum from his own debts to the Crown, alleging Robert de Dunstanvill as the recipient thereof, in the usual form. But in September 1168, Robert de Dunstanvill being dead, his heir Walter de Dunstanvill is similarly entered as entitled to the Manor.26 Of him however presently. \u2014 It should here be noted that Robert de Dunstanvill's interest in Surrey arose by purchase. He gave for Shalefeld (Shalford) and Aldeford 100 merks and n greyhounds to Robert de Watevill, a great Feoffee in the Honour of Clare. Hence, in 1165, Robert de Dunstanvill is returned as holding i Knight's-Fee in Surrey, of that Honour.27 I must now speak of his works of piety. Being Guardian I suppose of his Nephew Alan, he gave to Lewes Priory the Church of Bercham (Sussex), of the Fee of said Alan, a grant which the latter afterwards increased by giving an annual rent of 20s. He (Robert) also gave to the same Cluniac House the Chapel of Gretham.28 Lastly, he gave to the Priory of Farleigh (Wilts), a Cell of Lewes, the land of Cutiford, a grant which, after his death, was confirmed by his Nephews. He died, as I have said, about 1168, without issue; but before we proceed to his Successors, we should speak of Alan de Dun stanvill his younger Brother, who died long before him. This 55 Rot.

Alan seems to have held 8 Knights'-Fees in the Honour of Arundel, by favour of King Henry I, and before 1135. Though thereby questioning a high authority, I hesitate not to say that he was also Lord of Idsall, which he probably acquired by a similar patronage. In July 1141, he attests at Oxford a Charter which the Empress granted to Haughmond Abbey, his fellow-witnesses being several of them connected with Shropshire.29 He granted to Wombridge Priory half a ferdendel (or virgate) of land, which Eilric held in Leies (afterwards Prior's Lee), with all the children of the said Eilric.80 Lee was then a member of Idsall, of which Manor Alan de Dunstanvill is thus proved to have been Lord. This grant, as well as a further one of nine acres in Leia, passed before 1156, and both were confirmed by a Bull of Pope Urban in 1187, as the grants of Alan de Donstanvill.31 Either in conjunction with his wife, or for the weal of her soul, this Alan granted to Lewes Priory the land of Netimbre (Newtimber, Co. Sussex), and this Charter was confirmed, during the reign of Stephen, by William de Albini Earl of Arundel, of whose Honour the said land was held.32 I can say nothing more of this Alan de Dunstanvill than that in 1156 he was deceased. He left two Sons at least, \u2014 Walter and Alan, the latter probably under age. He had also a daughter Alice, who married Thomas Basset. Of Walter de Dunstanvill, eldest son and heir of Alan, we have innumerable notices. He first occurs at Michaelmas 1156, as having been excused, by writ of Henry II, his quota of the Dane- m Harl.

Again, in 1158, he is excused 14s. 6c/., his share of the donum of the same County. In 1156, he had also been assessed \u00a31. 6s. 3d. for the Danegeld of Shropshire, which debt, being left in arrear, was excused by the King in 1157. In 1158, the King further excused him a sum of 16s., his proportion of the donum of Shropshire.34 In 1162, when the Danegeld was again levied, Walter de Dun stanvill was assessed at and excused 27s. 6d. in Shropshire, and 58s. in Sussex.35 In 1165, he is returned as holding one fee of old feoffment under Adam de Port, of Herefordshire.36 I cannot identify this Fee. His Sussex Tenure of eight Fees in the Honour of Arundel was returned by the Earl under name of Alan de Dunstanvill (Walter's Father), \u2014 the Earl, as I have before explained, quoting a Feodary taken thirty years previously. Walter himself makes no return of his Shropshire Tenure in capite. In 1167, the Demesne of W'alter Dunstanvill paid a fine of one merk, inflicted by Alan de Nevill, who had been holding Pleas of the Forest in Shropshire.37 In 1168, it appears that having been assessed eight merks (on eight Knights'-Fees held of the Honour of Arundel) to the Aid for marriage of the King's daughter, he had refused to pay more than five merks, alleging that the other three merks were in excess of the just demand.38 In other words he asserted his tenure under the Earl of Arundel, to be by service of five, not eight Knights'-Fees. At or about this time, he became the heir of his Uncle Robert, succeeding thereby to Heytesbury, and other estates in Wiltshire, Surrey, and elsewhere. He is accordingly entered among the Wiltshire Grantees of the Crown as having the Manor and Hundred of Heytesbury, of _640. annual value.

This break in an otherwise uniform account, indicates I doubt not a contemporary forfeiture of Walter de Dunstanvill, but it begun rather earlier, and ended rather sooner than would tally with any supposition that the disgraced Baron was associated with the Treason of Prince Henry or the Norman rebellion of a somewhat later date. At Michaelmas 1173, the Sheriff of Wilt shire recognized his tenure of Heytesbury during the preceding half-year, and accordingly deducts \u00a320. blanch from his own liabi lities at the Exchequer. In following years the usual entry allow ing Walter de Dunstanvill's full tenure of Heytesbury, is continued. At Michaelmas 1177, the King having himself sat in judgment on those who were accused of trespassing on the Royal Forests, had amerced Walter de Dunstanvill in \u00a3100, \u2014 an enormous sum, and greatly in excess of other amercements inflicted on some principal persons in Shropshire. Walter had already paid \u00a350 of this fine, and before Michaelmas 1178, he discharged the balance in two sums of \u00a320. and \u00a330, paid to the Sheriffs of Shropshire and Wiltshire respectively.39 Besides his possessions in England, Walter de Dunstanvill had large estates in Normandy, situated apparently in the Bailiwick of Dieppe and Arques. He seems to have mortgaged his land of Roumaisnil in that quarter, to one Peter de Bures, who, having been Vicomte of Dieppe and Arques during the war (1173-4), was himself indebted to the Crown in vast sums of money. In part payment of such debts, Peter de Bures transferred Walter de Dun stanvill's mortgage to the King. Hence, on the Norman Exchequer- Roll of 1180, the said Walter appears as owing the King \u00a370. for Peter de Bures, which sum he formerly owed to said Peter, on his (Walter's) land of Roumaisnil.40 I should here notice that the Wiltshire Manors of Come, Colerne, and Wili, which had been of the Domesday Fief of Humphrey de Insula do not appear to have continued in his ordinary suc cession. They had been in possession of Reginald Fitz Roy, better known as Reginald de Dunstanvill Earl of Cornwall, and on his death (a.d. 1175), had escheated to the Crown. \u2014 The Sheriff of Wiltshire continued to account for tallages, scutages and ferms assessable on these Manors in 1189; but at Michaelmas 1190, Walter de Dunstanvill rendered account through the Sheriff \"of one hundred merks for his fine of the land of 39 Rot. Pip. 14 to 24 Hen. II. 40 Rot. Normannia (Stapleton) i, 67."], [794, "276 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. Cumbe, and Colerne, and of Wili.\" 41 He had in fact recovered part of his inheritance, and these Manors went to his Successors. In 1192, Walter de Dunstanvill appears to have been of the Retinue of John Earl of Moreton.42 Whether he was also im plicated in the subsequent treason of that Prince I cannot deter mine. That he was no favourite of King Richard is certain, but there is some obscurity, and something too of contradiction in the documents which bear upon this question. Those documents shall presently speak for themselves. Another matter of uncertainty is the precise period of his death ; and this I propose to investigate at length. Though the case is one in which a definite conclusion can hardly be established, it involves some points of collateral interest. \u2014 To men in those days, and in the position of Walter de Dun stanvill, there were other deaths than that of physical dissolution. There was what may be termed a civil death, the consequence of forfeiture or political disqualification; and there was the death quantum ad s\u00e6culum, as it was termed, when a man, as men often did, retired from the world to a Monastery. By one of these deaths, died Walter de Dunstanvill in 1194, but by which, let a comparison of documents decide if adequate so to do. The County of Wilts appears to have been visited by Justices Itinerant in October 1194, i.e. about six months after the King's return from captivity. \u2014 A Record of this Iter is preserved. It contains an Inquisition as to several matters in the Hundred of Heytesbury. From this mutilated document I think that I gather the following facts ; viz. that Walter de Dunstanvill's Manor of Hectredesburi, worth \u00a340. per annum, was in the King's hands ; \u2014 that Wido de Diva had so seized it for the King during some part of Easter Term preceding; \u2014 that the stock thereon had been escheated; that the Manor without such stock was worth \u00a323. per annum, \u2014 and that William de St. Mary-Church (then the King's Escheator) had made a more recent seizure thereof. It would also appear from another entry 41 Rot. Pip. 2 Ric. I, Wilts. Prince to the City of Dublin (F\u0153dera, i, 55.) About the same time a Charter of the Earl in favour of the Metropolitan Church of Rouen is tested by Walter de Dunestanville, Gilbert Basset, and many others, \u2014 Abbots, Earls, and Barons (Rot. Normannia, II, clix). 42 On May 13, 1192, he attests with Ingeram de Pratellis a Charter of John, Lord of L-eland and Earl of Moreton, dated at Reading (Monasticon, vii, 1143; ii). On the following day, at London, tlie same two persons attest a Charter of that"], [795, "IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. 277 that Walter de Dunstanvill was not deceased ; for he seems to have appeared in Court, and to have deposed that a former companion or follower of his, then a fugitive and accused of murder, had left his company before the said crime was perpetrated.43 That Walter de Dunstanvill suffered forfeiture before his death will also appear in another way. More than thirty-five years after this Wiltshire Iter, his Widow, claiming her dower in Shalefeld (Shalford, Surrey) , asserted that he (Walter) had held that Manor \" all his life, nearly to the last of his days, until King Richard, in the ninth year of his reign, of his own will and without judicial sentence, disseized him of that Manor and of all his lands.\"44 This Plea involved a false computation as to the regnal year of King Richard in which the alleged disseizin took place. Substituting the fifth for the ninth year of the King as the date of the disseizin, I have no doubt that the further fact (viz. that Walter de Dun stanvill survived his disgrace a very short time) is correct. At Michaelmas 1194, the Sheriff of Shropshire accounted 20s. for the Scutage of Walter de Dunstanvill in that County; and William de St. -Mary-Church, as the King's Escheator, accounted \u00a321. 4s. for his Scutage in Wiltshire.45 This was the Scutage for the King's Redemption, which was assessed at 20s. on each Knight's Fee. Walter de Dunstanvill had therefore been a Tenant in capite of 221 Knights'-Fees, thus charged. At Michaelmas 1195, William de St.-Mary-Church, as Escheator, accounts for a full year's ferm of certain Manors which were Walter de Dunstanvill's. Hectrediber, Brocton and Cumb, all in Wilt shire, and Bercham in Sussex, are thus enumerated ; and in one instance (that of Cumb) it is expressly said, that \" the King has the Manor in his hand, together with the Heir.\"46 Here then we have evidence, not only of the summary forfeiture, but also of the death of Walter de Dunstanvill. Before I proceed to speak of the succession of Walter de Dun stan-._11, I should say something of a number of Charters wherein his name occurs, and which further inform us of his connexions, possessions, and character. About the year 1167-8, Henry II, being then at Le Mans (in Maine), concedes and confirms to the Church of Ferlea (Farleigh, Wilts.), and the Monks there serving God, the land of Cutiford, 45 Rot.

Wherefore the said Monks were to enjoy the said land as Walter de Dunstanvill, and his Brother Alan, and the same Robert, their Uncle, had given and by their Charters confirmed it.47 A Charter by Walter de \" Donstanvill\" himself gives to Lewes Priory the land of Niewetimbre, for the health of his soul and the souls of his Father and Mother, who had before given the same. He also gives the Church of Winterburn, the tithe of his demesne of Scaldeford (Shalford, Surrey), the Church of Bernham, with the tithes of Hammes and the Chapel of Gretham (all in Sussex) ,48 Another Charter names the land of Niewtembre only, but has the same witnesses and is confirmed by \" William, Earl of Arundell, the third,\" in a separate deed.49 The Charters of Walter de Dunstanvill to the Priory of Wom bridge, in Shropshire, were numerous. I hardly can pretend to notice them in the order of their dates. In perhaps the earliest of the series, \u2014 \" Valter de Dunstanvill,\" addressing all the faithful of Holy Church and all his men, English and Norman, informs them that he has given to the Priory the land which his Father had given, viz. that which Eilric de Leis held ; \u2014 with all the children of the said Eilric, for the health of the souls of his Father and himself.50 47 Hart.

In another Charter \" Valter de Dunstanvill\" confirms his Father Alan's grant of half-a-Ferendel which Eilric held in Leies ; and he adds, for the health of the souls of himself, his wife, and parents, fourteen acres, to be held by the Canons together with the said land.51 The next grant of Walter de Dunstanvill to Wombridge, seems to be that of Aynulf's Lee ; but the two deeds which he executed in this matter, have been so inaccurately transcribed in the Wom bridge Chartulary, that I will venture to say nothing more of the premises conveyed, than that they seem to have been within the Lordship of Idsall, and to have constituted a part of that estate which the Canons of Wombridge afterwards enjoyed under the comprehensive name of Prior's Lee. By the first of these transcripts he is represented, as Walter de Dunstanvill, to give for the souls' health of himself and Predeces sors \" Leias Amulsi \" to the Priory ; he wills also that his body shall be buried in the aforesaid place of St. Leonard (that is in the Priory Church of Wombridge, dedicated to St. Leonard) if it should befall him to die in England.63 The second Transcript shows him as granting \"Amusne's Legam \" in the same way, but with a different set of witnesses to the Deed.53 His other gift to Wombridge Priory is the Main subject of three separate deeds, transcribed in the Chartulary. \u2014 Each deed has its peculiar significance.\u2014 By one, he gives for the soul's health of himself, his Wife, Hawiz de Praheus, and of his Predecessors and Successors, his 61 Ibidem, No. xiv.

He also gives twenty acres of his wood of Lehes near the land of Thomas de Lehes, as he and his free men shall provide.54 Another deed, with a similar movent-clause, gives the two Mills which he had in his Manor of Ydeshal, with all the suit of his men in the said Manor, and with free water-course from every and all sources, and means of repairing the mill-stanks whenever necessary, saving the multure of his own house. And for this the Canons were to find a Chaplain who should celebrate daily service in their Church of Wombrugg, for the souls' -health of himself, his wife, his Ancestors and Successors, for ever.55 In the third phase of this grant, Walter de Dunstanvill, Lord of Idshall, with the same movent clause, grants to the Priory two Mills which he had in his Manor of Ideshall, viz. the Mill of Idesh^ll and the Mill of Patesford, with sites of both, and suit of his free tenants, &c. with the same condition as to a Chaplain officiating daily for the souls of himself, his wife Hawise, &c. for ever.56 I close these extracts from the Wombridge Chartulary with refer ence to a deed, before set forth ; \u2014 wherein Walter de Dunstanvill, with his Knights, attests the Charter of Griffin de Sutton to that House.57 And he seems to have been interested in the concerns of other Religious Houses in Shropshire. \u2014 He attested the Certificates of Roger de Powis and John le Strange (I), wherein those great men recorded their remembrance of the first William Fitz Alan having granted Wroxeter Church to Haghmon Abbey.

This Walter de Dunstanville is said to have \" married Ursula a daughter and Coheir of Reginald de Dunstanvill Earl of Cornwall, and to have obtained in her right the Lordship of Ideshale.\"73 We have already seen that he acquired Idsall hereditarily from his Father, nor is it probable that the Earl of Cornwall ever had any interest there. And though the Manors of Cumbe (Castle-Cumb), Colerne, and Wili, in Wiltshire, having at one time been the Earl's, were afterwards given to Walter de Dunstanvill, yet I cannot account that circumstance to be evidence in proof of the alleged match. Those Manors seem to me to have been restored by the Crown to Walter de Dunstam -ill, as his own hereditary right rather than in the right of any wife. Be this as it may, and supposing that Walter de Dunstanvill had another wife or wives previous to his marriage with Hawise de Preaux, it is certain that by any such wife or wives he had no issue surviving him, and that his only Son, another Walter, was the Son of Hawise, and a mere infant at his Father's death. Without attempting to ascertain who was that wife of Walter de Dunstanvill to whom he alludes in his second Charter to Wom bridge, we have it on Hawise des Preaux own testimony that she became his wife after the accession of King Richard I (Sept. 1189), and we have also seen that within the next five years Walter de Dunstanvill had suffered forfeiture, under which he shortly died. \u2014 I have hinted a possibility that during such short interval he became a Member of some Religious Community. If so it was unquestionably the House of Augustine Canons at Wombridge 68 Lintot was a vill in the Bailiwick of Arques, where also lay Dunstanvill's Norman Fief. 73 Dugdale (Baronage, p. 591) quotes Vincent, Corr.p. 130, andi_...P\u00ab>.8Ric.

The following notice of his presumed Monument expresses the opinion of one who is well entitled to be heard on this or any other subject connected with Shropshire Antiquities :74 \u2014 \" In 1825,\" says my authority, \" the upper part of a very ancient monument, consisting of the cumbent effigy of a cross-legged knight in mail armour, with surcoat, sword in scabbard by his side, gauntlets on hands (the left holding the seahbard of, and the right on the hilt of, as if about to draw, the sword), spurs on heels, head resting on a cushion and thc feet on a Hon, was removed from Wombridge, where it had lain in the church-yard ever since the demolition of the old church, and where it went formerly by the appellation of ' old Dansyfylde,' but previous to its removal by that of ' old Dangerville,' to the south aisle of the Abbey Church, Shrewsbury. On its removal it was thought to represent the Walter de Dunstanville who died 25 Hen. III.\"75 My authority then refers to the Charter of the first Walter de Dunstanville, which expresses the Grantor's wish to be buried at Wombridge, and concludes the Effigy to be his. \u2014 In that view I most entirely concur. Having undertaken to give an account of this Barony and Family of Dunstanvill, I should before I pass to the immediate succession of Walter (I) , say something of his Brother Alan and his Sister Alice. Alan de Dunstanvill follows Walter in attesting several deeds of their Brother-in-Law, Thomas Basset, and his Son Gilbert, which deeds passed before the year 1181. In 1185-6, Alan de Dunstanvill appears as having to wife the Coheiress of Emma de Langetot, which Emma, then sixty years of age, was of the race of \" Chedney and Joceline Crispin.\" Her lands were in Buckinghamshire. The wife of Alan was then aged thirty.76 This Alan seems to have been largely enfeoffed in Cornwall ; probably during the time when the Earldom was held by Reginald de Dunstanvill. In 1187 he, Alan, was returned as holding twelve Fees in capite in that County.77 Passing some minor notices of his name it would appear that he long survived his elder Brother, for, on 5 Sept. 1216, King John empowers his beloved and faithful Alan de Dunstanvill to seize the lands of William Basset which are of his Fee, the said William being with the King's enemies.78 \u2014 74 Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury, \u2014 who contributed this notice to the Col lectanea Topographica et Genealogica (vol. v, p. 176), and by whose permission I transcribe it. this mistake by ascribing the grant of Aynulf's Lee to the second Walter de Dunstanville (Baronage, p. 591). 76 De Puellis et Dominabus, p. 21. 77 Liber Ruber Scaccarii, so. xlix. 78 Claus, i, 286.

These lands appear to have been in Cornwall. \u2014 It is, I presume, from this Alan de Dunstanvill that the present Barons De Dunstanvill and Basset allege a lineal descent, but Tehidy (Co. Cornwall), from which they take their title, remained with the elder branch of the family long after the era of Alan de Dunstanvill. Alice de Dunstanvill, sister of Walter and Alan, was married, before the year 1160, to Thomas Basset, usually styled of Heden don. He died about February 1181, but she was surviving in 1186.\u2014 Their issue was three sons, and a daughter, wife first of Albert de Gresley, who died about 1179, and secondly, of Wido de Creoun. \u2014 The Sons of Thomas and Alice Basset were Gilbert, Thomas, and Alan. Each of them attained a great position and has been reputed of Baronial Rank. Gilbert, the founder of Burchester Priory, has usually been styled of Hedendon. He died in 1205 leaving a sole daughter and heir, Eustachia, then the wife of Richard de Camvill. Thomas Basset, usually styled of Colinton, died in 1220, leaving three daughters his coheirs. Alan Basset, usually styled of Wycombe, seems to have lived till 1232, and left three sons, who, each in turn, enjoyed his honours, but had no male issue to continue their line. It was necessary to state thus much in order to explain various matters which came to be litigated during the life of Walter de Dunstanvill (II). His Father Walter (I), is said to have disposed of several Manors to his relations, e. g. to have given to his Sister Alice in frank-mar riage the Manor of Shalford (Surrey), to have petitioned King Richard to grant to Thomas Basset his Nephew, the Manors of Culinton and Witeford (Devonshire),79 and to have himself granted to Alan Basset, another Nephew, that Manor of Winterburn which we have so often mentioned. daughter of Alan de Dunstanvill, and had with her lands in Cornwall. These were given in frank-marriage by Alan. The Lady deceased before February 1208, when her Father was living. She is therefore improperly said by Writers on the Peerage to have been \" sole heir\" of Alan. She can only have been so in her soul of his said Uncle, gave to Wombridge Priory some land at Wich-Malbank (Cheshire). His deed is attested by Gil bert Basset and Brice Pantulf, &e.

King Richard's Charter on the subject was fully confirmed by King John on 20 March, 1200,81 Gilbert Basset fining twenty merks for such confirmation.83 Nevertheless the Widow of Walter de Dunstanvill (I), afterwards claimed dower in that Manor, and the right of Gilbert Basset's heirs thereto was otherwise disputed. At Michaelmas 1196, William de St. -Mary-Church, accounted \u00a321. 4s. for the Scutage of Normandy, being the sum chargeable on twenty-one and one-fifth Knights'-Fees of Walter de Dunstan vill, in Wiltshire. \u2014 The Sheriff of Shropshire, similarly accounted 20s. for Scutage of one Fee of the same Walter in that County. \u2014 Further, the wife of the said Walter had been deprived of Ydeshale about half a year, and William de St. -Mary-Church paid to the Crown, a sum of \u00a35. 6s. for rents received by him, in the interval, out of that Manor ; and 13s. id. for other perquisites thereof.83 At Michaelmas 1197, the Sheriff of Shropshire, on similar accounts, paid 20s. for the third Scutage of King Richard, \u2014 \u00a36. 3s. for one half year's issues of Ydeshal, and \u00a38. 5s. 2d.

His debt of \u00a316. 10s. id. for each year remained in arrear till April 8, 1204, when it was discharged from the Rolls, in consequence of a fine of 1000 merks which he offered the King to be quit of all accompts and arrears, in respect of escheats and wardships held by him up to that time.87 These arrears included a debt of \u00a330. due from the said Stephen, as Fermor of Heytesbury up to Midsummer 1200.88 From the latter period till March 1201, Robert de Berneres seems to have fermed Dunstanvill's Wiltshire and Sussex Manors. He subsequently accounted for various sums, which had thus become due on Heytesbury, Brocton, Cumb and Bercham.89 About April 1201, William Briwerr proffered to the King a fine of 300 merks to have custody, and marriage of the heir of Walter de Dunstanvill, saving the dower of said Walter's Widow.90 This Fine seems in the first instance to have been accepted; for on the Levy of a Scutage in 1201, William Briwerr had received \u00a312. 6s. 8d. from the Knights of Dunstanvill's Wiltshire Fief.91 However Briwerr's fine was eventually cancelled ; for about June 1201, Gilbert Basset proffered the double sum of 600 merks for the same Wardship. This Fine was received ; \u2014 and at Michaelmas 1201, Gilbert Basset's name appears as accredited, in the usual way, with the current half-year's ferm of Heytesbury.93 In April 1205, Gilbert Basset has respite for a portion of his Fine then due ; 93 but on Dec. 24, in the same year he was dead ; for then the Tenants, both of his own lands, and of the land which he had in custody with Dunstanvill's Heir, are enjoined to answer to John Fitz Hugh, and Bartholomew a Clerk, whom the King had appa rently appointed his Receivers in this matter.24 About February 1206, Thomas Basset proffered 200 merks, and all arrears of his Brother Gilbert's Fine, for this wardship.95 And it is clear that he had it ; \u2014 forpn March 3 following, the King orders John Fitz Hugh to ascertain whether Scaldeford (Shalford) had belonged to Walter de Dunstanvill (I), and, if it had, to give it up to Thomas Basset, as Custos of the heir.96 w ss 89 Sot. pip, 2 to 6 John. 91 Rot.

On March 15 following, King John restores to Gerard de Cam ville the Manors of Scaldeford and Anfald, which Gilbert Basset had held after his fine for custody of Walter de Dunstanvill's land. Gerard is to hold those Manors till it be cleared up in the King's Court (coram Rege), whether said Manors ought to remain to the heir of Gilbert Basset or to the heir of Walter de Dunstanvill.97 In Easter Term, 1206, it was settled in the King's Court that Scandeford should remain to Richard de Camvill and Eustachia, his wife, by concession and will of the King, till the son of Walter de Dunstanvill (apparently represented on this occasion by his guardian, Thomas Basset) should be of age.98 Meanwhile, aud, as I think, before the death of King Richard, Ingelram de Pratellis (or des Preaux) had married Hawise, Relict of the first Walter de Dunstanvill. This Ingelram was a younger son of a powerful Norman family. He had been in the Retinue of Dunstanvill and was probably related to Hawise. He after wards appears in the suit of King Richard, and among the special Favourites of King John. On her marriage with him, Hawise de Dunstanvill appears to have changed her Christian name. She is on all later occasions called Sibil.99 Her dower became matter of much litigation, but as early as Michaelmas 1199, I find Ingelram de Pratellis acquitted of his Scutage in Salop (assessed on the Fee of Walter de Dunstanvill), by writ of the King's Justiciar.100 Under similar writs, of the King, he was exempted by the Sheriff of Shropshire from the second, third, fourth, and fifth Scutages of John, as assessed in the years 1201, 1202, 1203, and 1204. To the sixth Scutage, that of 1205, he was assessed two merks for one Knight's-Fee. In 1206 he was exempted from the seveuth Scutage of the same reign.101 In June 1211, Ingeram de Pratellis was returned by the Sheriff as a Knight of Shropshire, holding the dower of his wife of the King in capite, by the service of one Knight's-Fee.

The money was paid to Roger, a Knight and Companion of said Walter.105 About Dec. 1213, he occurs as a Surety in a sum of twenty merks, for a Fine proffered by Isolda Biset in Wiltshire.106 In February 1214, he went with King John to Poitou,107 and the same year is Surety for a Fine proffered in Sussex by Robert le Sauvage. On Feb. 7, 121 5, being styled the King's \" faithful and beloved,\" he has a grant of Market and Fair, to be held in his Wiltshire Manor of Heytesbury.108 On Oct. 9, 1215, having been apparently under some suspicion of disloyalty, the King commands his Constables of Bristol, Marl borough, and Devizes, not to injure him or his lands, and to restore aught which they might have taken therefrom.109 On Dec. 10 following, Henry Fitz Count (Son of Earl Reginald) and the Sheriff of Cornwall are ordered to give him reseizin of Tiggedun, of which said Henry had disseized him.110 On July 23, 1216, his final secession from King John's allegiance is apparent. Thomas de Sams or d is then ordered to give his lands of Cumb, Brocton, and Heytesbury to Geoffrey and Oliver de Butevill for their support in the King's service.111 103 Liber Ruber, so. cxxxvij.

He paid the same in the year following.114 On Feb. 19, 1221, he had the usual Letters of Scutage in respect of his personal service in the Army of Biham, but at Michaelmas following, the Sheriff of Shropshire entered the Royal exemption of the Idsall Fee as in favour of Ingelram de Pratellis.115 At the Shrewsbury Assizes of November 1221, the cause between Engeram de Pratellis and Sibil his wife complainants (querentes) and Walter de Dunstanvill, concerning Sibil's Dower in Ideshall was compounded. The lands which Engeram and Sibil held in dower on the day of concord were to remain to them. And Walter would give to them, in augmentation, six librates of land in Hammes (Sussex) and in Berkshire. And they would remit to Walter all their right in his remaining lands. And if the lands in Hammes (Sussex) and in Berkshire were not sufficient to realize an annual income of \u00a36. then the deficiency should be made up out of lands in Wiltshire. This was the foundation of their agreement, and the parties were appointed to meet at Westminster on the octaves of Hilary (Jan. 20, 1222) to receive their respective Chirographs (formal Fines) ; and in the mean time, extent (valua tion) of the lands concerned was to be made.116 The final Concord thus contemplated was levied at Westminster 112 Ibidem, p. 341.

Another appointment of Attorneys in November 1226, calls the Defendant, \" William son of William Longespe,\" and states the claimed to be a third part of three carucates.120 At Michaelmas 1229, Ingelram de Preaux was deceased; and his heir was inadvertently entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll as owing two merks on one Knight's-Fee for the Scutage of Keri. But this entry has a mark of cancellation affixed, and the reason thereof given thus, \u2014 \" because Walter de Dunstanvill son and heir of Ingelram's wife, answers below.\" Accordingly an entry lower down on the Roll charges the said Walter with these two merks, but he had subsequent exemption by writ of the King.121 Sibil de Preaux, now a second time a Widow, continued her suit against William and Idonea Longespee. \u2014 \u25a0 On May 16, 1230, the cause came to trial at Westminster. \u2014 \" Sibil de Ferrers\" (so written for Praers)133 \" sued William de Longspee and Idonea his wife, for a third part of a Knight's-Fee in Shalefeld and Aldeford as her dower, whereof Walter de Dunstanvill, formerly her husband,\" (had been seized on the day when he had espoused her) .

On May 14, 1225, he is appointed a Commissioner to convey to Gloucester the tax of the Fifteenth then levied in the Counties of Salop and Stafford.124 On March 27, 1227, he has a grant of Market and Fair at Heytesbury, identical as to days and duration with the previous Charter of King John.125 His acquittance of the Scutage of Keri in 1229 has already been noticed. In Easter Term 1230, he had a suit against Reginald deAralletort and Johanna his wife and her coparcners, concerning land unspeci fied : \u2014 but it should be noted that this Joan was one of the daughters and coheirs of Thomas Basset, Walter's Cousin ; which Thomas had, as was said, the Manors of Collinton and Witeford by gift of Walter's Father.126 In 1230, 1231, and 1232, Walter de Dunstanvill was acquitted, 123 Dodsworth, vol. 42, so. 149, quoting Placit ad __9____,EasterTer_Q,14Hen.III, Surrey. \u2014 The original Roll is lost. 124 Claus, ii, 74. 125 Ibidem, 179. 126 Dodsworth, vol. 42. so. 150."], [813, "293 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. in respect of one Fee in Ideshale, of the Scutages of Bretagne.

The Chartulary of Wombridge does not, that I can find, mention his name. A grant which he made to Shrewsbury Abbey was only his part of a bargain, whereby he recovered the Advowson of Idsall, as will appear when I come to speak of the Church. He so far benefited the Abbey of Haghmon as to allow the Canons a right of road through his land of Adderley when they were going to, or returning from, Wiche in Cheshire, where they had some salt-pits. This grant, in which he is styled Gaiter de Dunstanvill, probably passed soon after, his marriage to Petro nilla Fitz Alan, for it purports to be for the health of himself, his greater (quorum tria faciunt duo) ; but when Scutage was levied at the rate of 2 merks (26... 8d.) on the greater fees, I find the lesser usually assessed (as in the text) at 16s. 8_., which is below the exact proportion. 127 Rot.

Thereby the Abbot, &c. conceded to Walter and his heirs the vill of Upton which they (the Monks) had from Alan de la Zuche. Walter and his heirs were in turn to pay the Abbot and his Successors a-half-yearly rent of 20s. at the Church of Ideshale, and he charges the said rent on the following of his free-tenants, viz.\" on Herbert de Wyke 17s. per annum, for a virgate which he held in Wyke ; on Richard de Castello 8s. for a virgate which he held at the Castle; on Thomas Golding 5s. for half a-virgate in Wyke ; on the Prior of Wombridge 2s. for an assart in Lega ; on Robert the Provost 4s. for half-a-virgate in Wyke ; on John Mugleston 3s. for ten acres at Woodhouse ; and on Oliver de Knolle Is. for a virgate in Knolle.

Some Manorial Deeds of this Walter de Dunstanvill shall be given under Upton, to which Township they probably refer. I should here state, that, as by the last recited Charter, the name of one of his wives was Dionisia, so must he have been married more than once; for the name of his widow and last wife was Rohese. The latter appears to have had her dower in Great Iselham (Cambridgeshire). She was living in 1279, when Master Giles de Bridport, her Tenant at Iselham, is returned as holding the Manor under her, whilst she had held it of the heirs of Walter de Dun stanvill, and they of the heirs of Fitzalan.155 Petronilla, daughter and sole heir of the last Dunstanvill, was, at her Father's death, wife of Robert de Montfort, who thus in her right became Lord of Idsall and other great estates. These he enjoyed not long for he was deceased in the year 1274. In the interval, that is at the County Assizes of September 1272, Robert de Montfort was returned by the Brimstree Jurors, as a defaulter in due attendance.156 As Robert Monteforde Lord of Ideshale, and for the souls' health of himself, his wife Petronilla, and all his children and Ancestors, he granted to Wombridge some small additions to Walter de Dun stanvill's grants, in the wood of Wyke, and in the direction of Stirchley-wood.157 Robert de Montfort dying, as I have said, in or before 1274, his wife Petronilla had sole Livery of her estates.168 It was probably during her widowhood, that Petronilla de Mont ford inspected and confirmed her Father's agreement with Buildwas Abbey, as before recited.159 Her eldest son William de Montfort was, at the time of his Father's death, and for long after, a Minor.

In 1284, under the name of Petronilla de la Mare, her liberties in regard to the Forests of this district seem to have been matter of inquiry.160 At the time of the County Assizes, October 1292, Petronilla being dead, John de la Mare was questioned as to his right of having Assize of bread and beer, Stocks, infangthef, a fair, a market, and free-warren in the Manor of Ideshale. His Attorney pleaded that John de la Mare was Tenant of the Manor by the Law of England ; that it was of the inheritance of William de Montfort, without whom, as being under age, he would not answer. The Crown prosecution was therefore ordered to remain till William de Montfort should come of age. At the same Assizes \" Petronilla de Montfort's \" former Tenure in Ideshall was returned as worth \u00a380 annum}61 In 3 Edw. II (1309-10), John de la Mare, of Bradwell (as he was called from his own estate in Essex), was still holding Idsall, by courtesy of England, when William de Montfort sold the Manor to Bartholomew de Badlesmere,163 who indeed purchased from him Adderley, and all, or almost all, his other estates. About four years later, viz. in 7 Edw. II (1313-14), died John de la Mare ; \u2014 and thus ends a history of nearly two centuries, which con nected the Manor of Idsall with the name and race of Dunstanvill. I wrill follow the subject no later, except to remark that, coin cidently with its change of Lords, the Manor appears to have been first described by its other name of Shiffnal. Thus Bartholomew de Badlesmere, in 9 Edward II, obtained a Charter to hold two Fairs in his Manor of. \" Suffenhale,\" and a contemporary grant of free-warren in his Manor of \"Ideshale.\" 103 The Genealogy which I have given for Dunstanvill is so different from one which rests on other authority that I cannot quit the subject without stating some points at least in what I wUl for the present assume to be an authentic account, 160 Calendar of Inquisitions, vol. i, Herdecote (Wilts), Iselham (Cambr.), and Bergham (Sussex), aU his wife's Manors; also in Michain (Surrey), Brad weU (Essex), and Bergholt (Suffolk), which were his own (Rot.

Pedigree of Dunstanvill, at the British Museum, marked \u2014 \" P. 4.\" It is apparently the work of a Herald, and belonged to, or was written by, one of the Wriothesleys, three of whom bore office in the College of Arms in the reigns of Edward IV, Richard III, and Henry VII. The principal points in which this Heraldic Pedigree differs from or agrees with the one I offer are these, viz. that Rainold (Reginald) de Dunstanvill married Atheliza daughter of Reginald de Warren, Brother of William 2d Earl Warren ;\u2014 that said Rainold was Baron of Castelcomb, that he granted in Waston to Tewkesbury, and that he died 3 April, 2 Hen. II (1156) ; \u2014 that Atheliza his wife died 1 May, 4 Hen. II (1158); that she was buried at Tewkesbury, and that her heart was buried at Castel-Acre (a Cell of Lewes, in Norfolk) ; \u2014 that the son and heir of Rainold and Atheliza was a second Rainold de Dunstanvill who died at Wilton in 30 Hen. II (1184), and who by his wife Isabella daughter of R * * * of Tholouse had a son Walter de Dunstanvill, Baron of Castel- Combe, whose wife was Ursula daughter of Reginald Earl of Cornwall; that the second Walter de Dunstanvill, son of Walter (I) and Ursula, married Matilda daughter of William Earl Mareseall, and had by her a son and heir, the third Walter; \u2014 that Walter de Dunstanvill (III) married Isabella daughter of Thomas de Clare Earl of Gloucester (a person whose existence is not elsewhere recorded), and that their only child Petronilla, married to Robert Montfort, had by him a Son and Heir, Wilham, who \"sold by fine his lands and possessions to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 3 Edw. II.\" Now there is something in this account which indicates that the Compiler had, to a certain extent, consulted the same authentic documents as those which I have quoted in my own narrative. There is something also which implies a reference to other authentic documents, not indeed specified by the Compder, nor ever seen by me, but which for the present we will presume him to have used honestly. But this Pedigree involves a third class of assertions, directly contradictory of facts which I have advanced on what appeared to me sound authority ; and these assertions are supported by written documents, \u2014 by professed copies of original Deeds. A better primd facie guarantee of honesty could not be offered. Here, then, are Wriothesley's Vouchers \u2014 The first is a Mandate of King John \u2014 \"John, D. G. &c, to the Sheriff of Wiltshire, greeting. Whereas Reginald late Earl of Cornwall, by fine levied in our Court at Westminster, in the 8th year of the Lord Richard late King of England, acknowledged that a moiety of the Manor of Colern and a third part of the Manor of Addersley in your County, were tlie right of Walter de DunstanviUe and of Ursula his wife, daughter of the said Earl, Father and Mother of Walter de Dunstanville now living, aud whose heir he (Walter II) is, as a gift in frank marriage, the which moiety Sir Richard MarischaU now holds, and the which third part aforesaid WUliam Beauchamp occupieth, \u2014 We command you, &c, that you make known to the said Richard and William that they are to appear before our Justices on the Morrow of All Souls (Nov. 3) if they have aught to say on their parts why execution of the aforesaid moiety and third part should not be made accordinn- to the aforesaid Concord. And you are to have there the names of those summoned &c.\" To say that this document does not remain on any existing RoU of John's reign to raise a question whether it may not have formed a part of one of the lost RoUs, to criticize its want of date and other technical informalities, is but to trifle with the truth. It is a detestable forgery, for Reginald Earl of Cornwall, whom it aUeges to have been Recognizor in a Fine levied in 8 Ric. I (1196-7), died in 1175.164 Whether Wriothesley himself adopted or concocted this document is a matter of smaU importance to us now, \u2014 a question only as to the credulity or dishonesty of a 164 Almost certainly, too, Walter de Dunstanvill (I) was dead before 8 Ric. I (1196-7)."], [823, "303 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. very ancient Herald. It suggests however the idea that Vincent and Dugdale may have derived their information, about the marriage of Walter de DunstanviU (I) and Ursula, from this, or some other equally spurious and too hastily adopted, authority. The mention of Addersley in the forged Charter is also curious. The Forger seems to have had some indistinct knowledge of a place so named having belonged to Walter de Dunstanvill, though he did not know that it was in Shropshire, and that Walter was Lord thereof before 1190; Another Wriothesley Voucher exhibits \" Reginald Earl of Cornwall as releasing an annual rent of \u00a310, which he had out of the Manor of Combe, to Walter de Dun stanville his son-in-law in frank marriage.\" Nothing is given whereby we may test the genuineness of this document. It is rather plausible than otherwise, for Reginald Earl of CornwaU was sometime Lord oi' Castle-Combe, and Walter de DunstanviU, after the Earl's death, obtained the whole Manor. The third Voucher runs thus : \u2014 \" The Market of Combe was conceded to the first Walter de DunstanvUl by King Henry II, as is plain by Letters Patent having a cord of red silk (ut patet per litteras patentes habentes rubeam sericam).\" A grant of Market under Letters Patent of Henry II would, I believe, be a solecism ; but, passing that question, I find that Cumbe did not belong to Walter de Dunstan viU (I) tiU after the death of Henry II. The fourth document says, that \" the Market of Colern on Fridays was granted to Walter son of the aforesaid Walter, by King Henry III.\" The Charter Rolls of that King do not, I think, corroborate this statement. However, it may be true. The fifth Voucher is a deed \u2014 \" Know all men, &c, that I, Walter Secundus de DunstanviUe, for a marriage to be had between Robert de DunstanviU my Nephew, son of John my Brother, and Gracia de Bohun, sister of the venerable Lord, Earl of Hereford, have given, &c., to the said Gracia \u00a350. of rents issuing out of the Manors of Colerne and Heytesberye in Com. WUtes, to hold all her life in name of dower. The witnesses are Robert de Dunstan ville my younger Brother, Roger de Budeston, Reginald de Fyloppe.\" This Charter is in itself suspicious, and more so from its appearance in bad company. The testing clause is introduced in a manner not in use in the thirteenth Century. It was very unusual for a Grantor to be so minute in describing relation ships, however such a practice might suit the convenience of later Genealogists. \u2014 I doubt much whether the second Walter de Dunstanvill had two, or even one Brother. The sixth and last document informs us that \u2014 \"The Market of Heytesbery was conceded to Walter de Dunstanvill and Dame Matilda his wife, daughter of William Marescall Earl of Pembroke, by King John in his 16th year, as appears by Letters Patent and Charter marked thus \"\u2014(a mark is here added indicating the original documents implied). Here again we have a genealogical statement quite unusual to a grant of Market. Moreover, it is almost certain that the Earl of Pembroke of this period had no such daughter as Matilda, thus announced. However, in this case, as a consequence of a date being given, we are enabled to refer to the enrolment of King John's Charter. \u2014 It is found to have passed at Marlborough on Feb. 7, in his sixteenth year (1215). It is enrolled both on the Close and Charter Rolls.165\u2014 Not a word does either Copy of the Grant say about Matdda or any other wife of the Grantee ! lc Claus, i, 186; Rot. Chart, p. 205 (Hardy)."], [824, "304 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. We may here dismiss this tissue of falsification and forgery. That very ancient School of Heraldry which originated such documents is perhaps extinct. Genealogy and Heraldry, apart from their moral and historical uses, are degraded studies.166 How can that be of moral use which perverts truth, and ministers to the worst form of famdy pride ? How can that be an avaUable element of History which poisons the very fountains of History itself ? The Manor of Idsall involved many Townships or Members, held by Tenants of various rank and importance. Before I speak of any of these I will give account of \u2014 EVELITH which, though locally situated within Idsall Manor, is not known ever to have been a member thereof. Its Domesday status is very uncertain. Our next subsequent notice of it would make it a separate Manor, or associate it with Hatton rather than Idsall. We have still later and stronger indications that it was an out lying Member of Moreton (now Moreton Corbet). If this were the case at Domesday, Turold will have been its 'first Norman Lord and Hunnit and Uluiet his Tenants ; but that Record makes no mention of any outlying member of Moreton. Such an omission is however by no means negative of the connexion.167 The Tenure was perhaps at Domesday a complex or a disputed one. In a case of such uncertainty it is better to follow the rule suggested by situation. I therefore treat of Evelith under Idsall. I have set forth under Hatton the Deed whereby Adam Traynel of Hatton granted to his Nephew Ivo, \"his Manor of Ivelith as well in Ivelith as in Hynynton, at an anuual rent of a red rose.\" \u2014 I have treated this Deed as one of debatable antiquity, but to which I was myself inclined to assign a very ancient date, viz. the earlier half of the twelfth Century. In the end of that Century, we have several notices of Evelith 166 For some remarks on the falsification of written documents I refer to Mr. Blake way's Preface to the Sheriffs of Shropshire (page vi) ; also to the same Author (His tory of Shrewsbury, vol. i, p. 309, note) for a statement of the moral uses of Genealogical research. to mention by name any such outlying members of a Manor as may have lain in another Hundred. As regards More ton and Evelith this ride would not apply ; for, whether we consider Evelith a member of Moreton or of Idsall, it was equally within the district described in Domesday as Bascherch Hundred. 167 It is the general rule of Domesday"], [825, "305 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. or its owners ; but none of them connected in any manner with \" the said Deed. \u2014 This, by the way, is a further reason for attributing to that Deed a greater antiquity. I will now notice indifferently, except as regards chronology, the circumstances which exhibit Evelith as a member of Moreton rather than of Idsall. Hunnit with his Brother (Uluiet) held Mortone in Saxon times. At Domesday they still continued to hold it, but under Turold its Norman Lord. I have mentioned, under Willey, that several Manors which were thus held by Hunnit and Uluiet at Domesday were after wards held by Toret (another Saxon) and by Toret's descendants.168 Thus it was with Moreton and with Evelith, for Toret and his representatives will appear to have held Moreton under Turold or his representatives ; and Evelith was eventually, if not primarily, held in the same feudal ratio. Toret the Saxon, living in the time of Edward the Confessor, noticed in Domesday , and surviving in the early part of the 12th Century, was undoubtedly the progenitor of a family which took its name of Toret or Fitz Toret from him. Whether Peter Fitz Toret who lived in the last half of that Century was the grandson or great grandson of Toret, I will not attempt to decide. His son he can hardly have been.169 From the year 1160 to the year 1194, the name of Peter Fitz Toret is constantly occurring in connexion with Shropshire places or Shropshire men ; but in far the greater number of instances this Peter appears as a follower, a witness to the deeds of, or as a Knight of Walter de Dunstanvill (I) Lord of Idsall. But it is more than probable that he was Dunstanvill's Tenant, not indeed at Evelith, 168 Supra, page 49. Robert Fitz Aer (Alcher), or Roger Fitz Odo in 1165, \u2014 and if we forthwith con clude that the last three were sons of the first three, we shall probably be only in degree less mistaken than those who might conclude that Peter Corbet, or Hugh Fitz Aer, or WUUam Fitz Odo, of the fourteenth century, were also Sons of the same ori ginal founders of a race. \u2014 169 Nothing has been a more fruitful source of genealogical paradox than the mistaken idea which some Writers seem to have entertained with regard to the personal nomenclature of the twelfth Cen tury. The Norman Aristocracy of that period adopted a system which, though in idea patronymic, was in practice anything else. In short, if I may coin the words, it was equally avonymic or proavony-mic, The term \" filius\" or \" Fitz,\" as gene rally used in the twelfth Century, means \"descendant of,\" not \"son of;\" \u2014 but in some exceptional cases a strictly patrony mic nomenclature, Uke that of the Welsh, seems to have obtained among the Normans. or something higher still.

Of that we shall have to speak hereafter. Here it should be noticed how that in some late appearances of Peter Fitz Toret he is accompanied by Philip and Bartholomew his sons, how also, in the latest of all, Bartholomew alone is his Father's attendant. The inference is that Philip died in his Father's lifetime and without issue, for Bartholomew certainly succeeded to Peter. As I have thus far been able to connect Peter Fitz Toret with Dunstanvill, Lord of Idshall, rather than with Evelith, so now shall I show Bartholomew Fitz Toret rather in association with Evelith than with Dunstanvill or Idsall. On April 23, 1200, Emma Fitz Roger is suing, at Westminster, Bartholomew Fitz Peter, the Tenant, for one carucate of land in Ivelithe, under writ of mort d'ancestre. The Recognizors making default, the cause was adjourned till the King's Justices should be in those parts.170 I find no conclusion of this suit, but during the next thirty-five years one Gerard Fitz Toret is frequently occurring in this neigh bourhood either under that name or as Gerard de Ivelith. He, I doubt not, was a younger Brother of Bartholomew, and also his Under-Tenant at Evelith. He has already been mentioned as attesting grants of Roger la Zouche and Philip de Burwardsley to Buildwas, and also a Brockton deed of William Cocus. Furthermore, Bartholomew de Moreton (that is Bartholomew Fitz Toret or Fitz Peter) and Gerard de Yvelith attest a grant which Richard, son of Richard Corbet (Bartholomew's Son-in-law), made to Buildwas Abbey before 1225 ;171 and in 1229 both witnesses again appear in company, and, as Knights, superintending a Convention to which Madoc de Sutton was a party.1'3 Bartholomew Fitz Toret appears to have deceased before 1235. 170 Rot.

I omit to say here much that still remains to be said of his Ancestry and Succession both in this and other Counties. His Shropshire estates passed with his daughter to Richard Corbet of Wattles borough, her husband, and in course of time to Robert Corbet their Son. Robert Corbet, Lord of Wattlesborough, &c. in right of his Father and of Moreton Toret (afterwards Moreton Corbet) and Evelith, in right of his Mother, had succeeded before 1255. His connection with Evelith made him frequently a visitant here and probably an occasional resident, for he certainly held the estate partly in demesne. We have seen him attesting the Charters of Walter de Dunstanvill (III) Lord of Idsall, and his name appears in other Deeds concerning this neighbourhood. At the County Assizes (September 1272), the Brimstree Jurors reported that John Ivelithe had broken open the Grange of Robert Corbet. The accused was outlawed.173 The Tenure-Roll of 1284, commonly known as \" Kirby's Quest,\" says under Brimstree Hundred that \" Robert Corbet holds one virgate in Yevelye of the Lord of Moreton ' Tubaud,' but that the Inquisition (from which the Roll was framed) did not mention whom the said Lord (of Moreton) held under.\" \u2014 That the Scribe who wrote this entry meant to present by \" Moreton Tubaud,\" the place at first called Moreton Toret and afterwards Moreton Corbet, is evident, and his ignorance of the seigneural Lord is compensated by the entry under Moreton itself, where it is said that, \u2014 \" Robert Corbet holds the vill of Moreton with its members, viz. Preston in Pymhill Hundred (i. e. Preston Brockhirst), and Ivelithe in Brimstree Hundred, under Reginald de Chetewinde, and he (Reginald) holds under Richard Fitz Alan.\"174 A Tenure-Roll of Bradford Hundred, made not three years later than the last, repeats the same statement, substituting \" Ivelynton\" for \" Ivelithe,\" \" Roger de Chetwene \" for \" Reginald,\" and adding that \" Richard Fitz Alan holds (over Chetwind) of the King in capite by half a Knight's Fee, and that the Manor is geidable.\"175 I have said, under Willey, that the usual representative of Turold's Domesday Interest is found to be De Chetwynd in the next succeed ing period. Here is an instance of that fact, as well as of the 173 Placita Corona, 56 Hen.

At the Assizes of October 1292, Robert Corbet was questioned as to the right of Free-Warren exercised by him at Ivelyth. He adduced a Royal Charter of Free-Warren in Morton Corbet and Wattlesburgh, and averred that Ivelith was an appurtenance of Moreton. But Hugh de Louther (the Crown Prosecutor), asked that Judgment should be given for the King, because that Ivelyth was not named (in the said Charter), and was distant from Moreton as much as ten leagues. The Court decided that the aforesaid land of Ivelyth should be deprived of Warren (dewarrenetur), and found Corbet to be in misericordid.116 An Inquisition on the death of Robert Corbet of Moreton, was ordered by writ of Nov. 14, 1300. The return is sadly defaced, but is sufficiently legible to show him as having held \" Ivelith under John de Chetwynd.\"177 A Chapel existed some time at Evelith. Its site was pointed out at the close of the last Century.178 \u2014 A field adjoining the spot where the Manor House formerly stood is still known as the \" Chapel Yard.\" HINNINGTON. This was undoubtedly a member of the Domesday Manor of \"Iteshale.\" It was subsequently held under the Lords of Idsall, by the same men who held Evelith under the Chetwynds. Perhaps Hunnit or Hunninc, the usual predecessor of Toret and Corbet, was also their predecessor at Hinnington. The latter name, anciently written Hunnington, indicates almost as much. If so, this is one of a very few instances where a Saxon of so late an era as the reign of the Confessor, can be supposed to have given its name to any Shropshire locality. Adam Traynel's very early grant to his Nephew Ivo, conveys the Manor of Evelith, as if Hinnington were part and parcel thereof. That Deed however, probably in consequence of its great antiquity, can be coupled with no other known fact, either as regards the succession of Traynel or of Hunnit. 176 Placita Corona, 20 Edw.

I have alluded to the very frequent attestations of Fitz Toret and his descendants, which are found in Dunstanvill Deeds. These may chiefly be attributed to Peter Fitz Toret's tenure of Hinnington and Hem, under the Lords of Idsall. That Baldwin de Hinetun, who, with John his Son, attests the Charter of Walter, Son of John de Hemes, to Buildwas, was probably Fitz Toret's Under-Tenant at Hinnington.179 \u2014 The said Charter passed before 1202, and in the succeeding period I find John de Hinitun attesting a deed which will be given under Upton. I find no other mention of Under-Tenants here, but the Inquisition taken on the death of Robert Corbet of Moreton, in 1300, says expressly that he held Hemme and Hynyton under John de la Mare.180 And a later Inquisition, taken May 7, 1310, on the death of Thomas Corbet of Moreton, is still more explicit. He died seized of the \" Hamlets of Hemme and Hynyton, within the Manor of Ideshale, which were held of Sir John de la Mare, Lord of Ideshale, by half a Knight's-fee.\" 181 THE HEM Nearly aR that can be said of the Tenure of this Hamlet has been implied under Hinnington. Like Hinnington, it was held under the Lords of Idsall, perhaps by Hunnit in the first and Toret in the second instance, but more certainly by Fitz-Toret and Corbet in the third and fourth. Johnde Hemes, and Walter his Son, who granted to Buildwas in the 12th Century, were probably Peter Fitz-Toret's Under-Tenants here. Their being also Under-Tenants of Traynel at Hatton, is only another phase of that inexplicable connection which associates and at the same time confuses the relative histories of Hatton, Hem, Hinnington, and Evelith. We have further seen John de Hemmes attesting between 1192 and 1194 (with Peter Fitz Thoret and his Sons) a Grant of the first Walter de Dunstanvill, that is, as I take it, the Under Tenant attesting with the Mesne Lord a grant of the Seigneural Lord of Hem. I have little to say more of the family of these Under-Tenants, which seems to have decreased in importance. At the Assizes of isi Inquisitions, 3 Edw.

WYKE. This was a member of Idsall. About the year 1219, Walter de Dunstanvill (II) conveys to Shrewsbury Abbey, among other rents, one of 12d. payable by Alan the Chaplain, his Tenant in Wyches.18- Walter Mareschall and Robert de Wikes were perhaps Tenants here between 1220 and 1230. The next Tenant who occurs is Herbert de Wyke a person of some importance and apparently Bailiff to the Lords of Idsall ; for I take him to be identical with \" Herbert, formerly Bailiff of Ydeshall\" who attests a Wombridge Charter between 1227 and 1240 ;183 and Herbert Seneschal of Ideshall is found attesting a deed of very little earlier date. In 1248, Walter de Dunstanvill (III) had three Tenants in Wyke whose Quit-Rents he assigned to Buildwas Abbey in part exchange for Upton. These were Herbert de Wyke who paid 17s. annual rent on a virgate, Thomas Golding who paid 5s. on half-a-virgate and Robert the Provost, who paid 4s. on half-a-virgate.184. For the five years ending October 1254, Herbert de Wyke was Agistator of the Royal Forest of Morse and the Haye of Wellington. He attests deeds of this period as Herbert de Ideshal, and, under that name, sat as third Juror of Brimstree Hundred at the Assizes of 1256. Soon after this he died ; for when, in February 1262, the Justices of the Forest visited Shropshire they summoned Herbert son and heir of Herbert de Wyk (or de Ydeshal) to answer for the five years in which his Father had been Agistator.18* From this period for the next twenty years, I find Herbert de Wyke and Walter Marshall of Wyke frequent witnesses of local deeds. Two of these bear date Oct. 21, 1270, and Aug. 9, 1279. In 54 Hen.

This Jury reported, inter alia, that Alice, wife of Walter Carter of Routhton, had challenged, in the County Court, Thomas, son of Herbert de Wyke (probably the Juror's Brother) and Robert de Duddelegh, for murder of said Walter her husband. She had also accused the Abbot of Buildwas of har bouring the murderers. Alice not appearing at the Assizes the Abbot and Duddelegh were acquitted, but it was shown that Thomas Fitz Herbert was dead.187 Between 1280 and 1292, Herbert de Wyke was succeeded by his Son John, who sat as 12th Juror of the Hundred at the October Assizes of the latter year, and occurs as a witness of various local deeds, and as a Juror on several Inquests of the next twenty-four years; after which Elyas de Wyke, a Clerk, seems to occupy his position. Meanwhile, that is on Feb. 23, 1293, a Fine was levied at Stafford between Master John de Kenleye, Clerk, complainant (querentem), and Robert de Clone, and Mabel his wife, deforciants, of a messuage and twenty acres in Wyk, whereof was pJea of convention. The Deforciants, relinquished the same,\u2014 to be held by the Complainant, of the Lords of the Fee. For this he gave _\u00a35.188 On Jan. 27, 1297, this same Master John de Kenleye was Complainant in a fine levied at Westminster, whereby Roger de Orleton, and Rohese his wife, surrendered to him a messuage and twelve acres in Ideshale, whereof was plea of warranty ; \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee.

Between the years 1220 and 1250, Robert de Trilwardyne, with his name spelt in various ways, is a witness of local Charters, more particularly of those which relate to Brockton.

Petronilla renounced her claim, and Robert conceded to her nine acres in the same vill (viz. three acres in Rudingfeld, three acres in Winterfeld, and three acres in the field towards Wyk), to hold to Petronilla for her life, at a rent of one penny.190 This second Robert de Trillewardyn occurs occasionally^ as a witness during the next sixteen years ; but on Sept. 29, 1269, he would appear to be deceased, for then did Edith, daughter of Robert de Trillewardine, lease to Wombridge Priory all her land within and without the vill of Brocton, for twelve years, reserving to her self a house and orchard and certain stipulated shares of the produce of the said land.191 A great part of the district of which we are speaking had, in ancient times, been within the jurisdiction of the Royal Forest. \u2014 The Perambulation of 1300 recognizes the following vills and hamlets as disforested, viz. the vills of Prioreslegh and Wodehous (Woodhouse), a moiety of Drey ton (near Shiffnal), Haghton (Haugh ton), La Cnolle (still traceable in Knowle-Wood) , Trillewardyn, Wyk a moiety of Hem, the wood of Kembrithton (Kemberton), a third part of Sutton (Maddock), a moiety of Brockton, &c. \u2014 Hence we approximate to the locality of Trilwardyne.

PRIORS LEE. The House of Augustine Canons, founded at Wombridge as early as the reign of Stephen, acquired its first interest in the Lordship of Idsall under grant of Alan de Dunstanvill. His gift, described as the land of Eilric de Leis,was subsequently increased. His Son Walter gave Aynulf's Lee (less intelligibly written as \" Leias Amulsi\") to the Canons. These two grants, with some later additions, constituted, I sup pose, the estate afterwards known as Priors Lee. The Canons once established in such a position, were not slow to improve it. They acquired various parcels of land and other rights in adjoining Townships. Some of these have been already instanced in our account of the succession of Dunstanvill. Others again will have to be noticed under their proper localities. One or two shall be mentioned here. \u2014 About 1260, Thomas, Son of Roger Guest, of Lega, gave the Priory a noke of land, in the vill of Lega, which John de Mocleston once held of him.194 About ten years later, and apparently in completion of a previous grant of Walter de Dunstanvill (III), Alice, widow of Gilbert Bluet, quits all right which she had for life in an assart in the Manor of Ydeshall. For this the Priory paid her 20s. in hand, and allowed her an annuity of 2s. for her life.195 Again, about ten years later, Thomas de Brocton (of Brockton juxta Sutton Madok), gave the Priory an annual rent of 5s. 6d., which Robert, called Pollard, of Priors Lee and his heirs were bound to pay on half-a-virgate in the said vill of Priors Lee.

Thomas de Lee seems to have been eventually succeeded by his second son Leonard, from whom this vill derived its distinctive name. About the year 1219, Walter de Dunstanvill (II) in composition of the claim which Shrewsbury Abbey had to the Advowson of Idsall, assigned to the monks 27s. annual rent, chargeable on several of his Tenants. \u2014 A sum of 2s. receivable from Leonard de Leges in respect of his fee of Leges was thus assigned.200 In November 1220, Leonard de Lega was a Juror in the great suit then pending about the Advowson of Tong. Soon after this, Osbert Lord of Stirchley, granting a parcel of land to Wombridge, within the Fee of Stirchley, mentions among the boundaries of the said parcel a meadow which belonged to Richard Fitz Ralph of Parva Legh, and a fence which ran between Leonard's Ley and Stirchley Wood. Sir Leonard de Ley himself stands first witness to this grant.201 Another Wombridge Charter which passed in or after the year 1231, is attested by men of knightly degree, and last of all by Leonard de Lega and Walter his Son.203 At the same time a deed which will be quoted under Upton, and which certainly passed in or before 1232, is attested by Walter de Lega, whom I therefore take to have succeeded his Father about this time. Ten years later, and we have Henry son of Leonard de Lega as his Father's, or rather Brother's, Successor ; \u2014 for on November 18, 1240, a Fine was levied at Salop between William de Eyton and Matilda his wife, Plaintiffs, and Henry Fitz Leonard, Tenant, \u2014 of a third part of six acres of lands and two messuages in Parva Legh, whereof was suit of mort d'ancestre. \u2014 William and Matilda relinquished, for themselves and for the heirs of Matilda, all right in the premises and in all lands of Henry ; for which the latter paid them four merks.203 I should imagine from what follows, that this Matilda was a Sister or Half Sister of Henry de Legh ; for on January 27, 1249, Johanna and Nicholaha de Legh, who certainly stood in one of 202 Ibidem, No. ix. 203 Pedes Finium, 25 Hen.

Henry surrendered the premises, to hold to Nichola and her heirs, of the Lords of the Fee. In return Nichola conceded half the land which she had hitherto held in the same vill, viz. half-a-virgate which Richard Fitz Ralph (whom we have heard of before) sometime held, and the messuage which Roger, Parson of Styrchley, sometime held, and the messuages, &c. formerly held by Adam Hubert, Alan Hubert, and Richard Stok ; to hold to Henry and his heirs, of Nichola and her heirs, at a penny rent.205 At the same Assizes at which this Fine was levied, other suits which concerned the same family were in progress; and though they did not relate to the locality now under notice it will be better to introduce them here. \u2014 Joanna de Leye and Nichola her Sister sued under writ of Mort d'ancestre for two merks annual rent in Weston, which they alleged Leonard their Father to have died seized of, and which William de Forde withheld from them. The latter offered a fine of half-a-merk to the Crown that he might have a \"good Assize,\" Thomas Boterel and * * * de Overton being his Sureties. It was found that Leonard had not died thus seized, for that the rent was the marriage portion of Joanna, Mother of William de Forde, who after holding it for many years surrendered it to her said Son for ten merks. The Defendant was dismissed sine die?06 In another suit, Sibil wife of Henry de Lega appoints the said Henry her Attorney against Robert de la Forde. This seems to have been a cause wherein the latter sued the former for a virgate of land in Preston (on the Wild-moors), and which Sibil and Henry had by grant of Thomas Rabaz.207 In Easter Term 1258, a fine was levied at Westminster between Robert de la Forde, Plaintiff, and Thomas Rabaz, whom Henry and Sibil had called to warranty, \u2014 of a virgate in Preston, and who vouched such warranty. \u2014 Thomas now acknowledged the right of Robert, who allowed Thomas to hold the land for life, at a penny 204 \u2022 2n6 Ibidem. 33, 40 Hen.

Under his, as yet unlocalized, name of Oliver, he has been seen to attest the Deed, whereby his Lord bestowed his body in burial at Wombridge. I think too that it must have been his wife or widow who, under the name of Sibil de Halcton, occurs as holding lands within Regard of the Forest of Mount Gilbert, in 1209. Be that as it may, he or his Son or Grandson, under the one name of Oliver de Knolle, continue to occur for about 90 years in this neighbourhood, dating from the time of the above Deed. Besides their attestations of various Charters, one of these suc cessive Olivers appears in 1248, as holding a virgate of land' in Knolle, under the third Walter de Dunstanvill, at a shilling rent, which rent was then transferred to Buildwas Abbey.212 At the Assizes of 1256, an Oliver de la Knoll officiated as a Juror for Brimstree Hundred ; and the same or another Oliver de Knoll attests a Charter of his Lord, Robert de Montfort, between 1270 and 1274. We have then a Richard de la Knoll attesting a few local Deeds, and sitting as a Juror (Sept. 25, 1276) on the Inquest which reported about Robert le Strange's disposal of Sutton Maddock. From August 9, 1279, to November 12, 1335, I find Thomas atte Knolles, or Thomas de la Knolle, a constant witness of local Deeds, and on November 1 7, 1336, this uniformity is interrupted by the occurrence of Pagan de la Knolle in a similar position. THE CASTLE. A Tenement, thus entitled, was by no means the residence of the Lords of Idsall ; but one of the smallest members of the Manor, still to be traced, as regards name and situation, in the \"Castle Farm.\" In 1248, an annual rent of 8s., due from Richard de Castello, on a virgate of land, to Walter de Dunstanvill (III), was transferred by the latter to Buildwas Abbey.213 About the year 1270 Emma, widow of Richard de Castre, and apparently daughter of Roger de Halaton (Haughton), quits to Hugh de Halaton (Son of said Roger) the house which her late Husband bought from said Roger, in the vill of Cnolle, with a garden and croft adjacent, and two acres of land, one in the field H2._i3 Cart 20 Edw.

She also sur renders to the same Hugh three acres of land, which said Roger had given her in frank marriage?1* At the Assizes of September 1272, the name of Richard de Castro was called in question in a matter which concerned several others in the neighbourhood, but which may be mentioned here as well as elsewhere, though I am not sure whether Richard himself was living at the time or whether he had left a successor of both his names. William, son of Robert de Divises, had been apprehended and im prisoned on some charge, but, by precept of the King, had been given into custody of the following persons (bail for his appearance), viz. Richard de Castro in Ideshale, Richard Holegode of Chaffenhale (Shiffnal), Robert de Lotwych in the same, Robert Bernehoud in Upton, Roger de Howele in Upton, Henry Bluet in Ideshale, Adam le Lymer of the same, Adam de Dreyton, Thomas de Brerlakton of Staunton, Simon de Ideshall, and Richard de Stapenhull in Wode hous. Now (1272) these Sureties were reported by the Brimstree Jurors as not duly producing the accused, so they were found to be in misericordid, but at the same time the accused was acquitted of any crime.215 WOODHOUSE. A rent of 3s. per annum, payable by John Mugleston for twelve acres in Wodehous, was in 1248 assigned by Walter de Dunstanvill (III) to Buildwas Abbey.216 This John de Mocleston has already occurred, about 1260, as a Tenant in Priors-Lee. The principal Tenants at Wodehous seem, however, to have had name from the place. Sometime in the thirteenth century, Henry de Wodehous appears to have given towards the lights of the Church of St. Maiy and St. Leonard of Wombridge some land and 6d. rent, which he had purchased from Richard de Stapenhull217 (just mentioned under The Castle). This Henry was, if I mistake not, the same person who, under the name of Henry son of Hamund de Wodehus, was Grantee of Robert le Strange (of Sutton and Wrockwardine) in the latter Manor. 215 Placita Corona, 56 Hen.

In 1180, the Township (villata) of Haleton was fined half-a-merk by Justices of the Forest for purpresture. About 1185, Roger de Halechtune, Dunstanvill's Vassal here, being dead, the said Baron granted to \" Oliver, his Harper, custody of the land of the deceased, for his life, together with the Widow of the said Roger, whom Oliver had already espoused, with Dunstanvill's consent. Also Oliver was to have custody of the heir of Roger, and was to take order concerning the said heir according to his own will. And this wardship was to be free of tac and tol to Oliver and his men, and free of all services except that Oliver was to mew one sparrow-hawk annually at his own cost, or to mew a goshawk (ostorium) at the cost of his Lord, in which case the Lord's men were to provide a cage wherein the bird should be placed.\" 219 The remainder of this Charter, so illustrative of feudal tenures and customs, has been recited under Knowle. The Heir, thus dis posed of, seems to have been that Hugh de Haltun whom we shall see attesting an Upton Deed, before 1232. Between 1242 and 1248, Roger de Halghton, doubtless of this place, was on a Jury which settled certain forest-rights of the Abbot of Lilleshall.220 Between 1248 and 1256, a second Hugh deAlcton or Halighton occurs, first as attesting an Upton Deed of Walter de Dunstanvill (III), and next as being assessed, about March 1250, for certain small parcels of assarted land within the jurisdiction of the Forest. In this case, he is described as Hugh de Halighton apud Ideshal, 218 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Lopin ton, Nos. x, xi, viij.

He is moreover a witness of several local deeds at this period. This Roger was succeeded by his son, a third Hugh, before 1274; for between 1270 and 1274, \u2014 \" Robert de Montford, Lord of Idesale, grants to Hugh de Haltone and his heirs, thirteen acres of land in the Manor of Idesale, lying between Richard le Hope's assart and Hotunalle, near the assart of Roger Hod (of Drayton), in a place called Ulet-hay. \u2014 For this Hugh paid two merks down, and was to pay an annual rent of 6s. in lieu of all services except suit of the Lord's Court.\"223 This same \"Hugh de Halaton\" has been already noticed as having purchased about this period certain premises from Emma, Widow of Richard de Castro, perhaps his (Hugh's) Sister.223 In September 1276, Hugh de Halenton sat as second Juror on the Inquest as to Robert le Strange's disposal of Sutton. On August 9, 1279, an agreement was come to between John de Stiventon and Hugh son of Roger de Halhton. John undertook that Hugh and his heirs should peaceably hold all assarts within the Manor of Hydeshale, which they held at the time of agreement. It was also settled in regard to certain woods, plains, roads, paths, water-mills, and other liberties (in which the parties seem to have had some common interest), that either party should, with consent of the other, make improvements. Hugh also gives a similar undertaking, as regarded John's assarts, to that which John had given. Further, John quitted to Hugh one part of the wood and waste which he had in the wood of Wyke from John de Grenhull, as the parts were fenced adjacently to Trillewardin. Hugh is to pay for this donation an annual rent of 2d. to John and his heirs, 221 Rot. Pip. 38 Hen. Ill, Salop. 223 Contemporary with this Hugh was also an Alan de Haughton, perhaps also a relation.

Two deeds alternately sealed with the seals of each party were written and exchanged.224 On September 2, 1281, King Edward I, wishing to do the Prior of Wombridge a favour, and to relax in his case the stringency of the recent Statute of Mortmain, gives him license \" to take in fee farm the mill of Hugh de Halghton in Halghton, at such terms as Hugh and the Prior may agree upon between themselves. And Hugh may demise the same, saving the rights of any other party.\"225 This permission was not immediately acted upon, perhaps in consequence of a dispute which arose between the parties in reference to another matter. \u2014 In Trinity Term 1282, the Prior of Wombridge recovered a right of common-pasture in twenty-one acres of Waste, in Halghton and Knole, which right was appurtenant to the Prior's tenement in Prior's Leigh. And Hugh and his son were in misericordid.\u20146 \u2014 This decision seems to have been inconclusive ; for, on October 20th, 1282, a cause was heard before Ralph de Hengham and his Fellow-Justices at Shrewsbury, in which the Prior of Wombridge sued Hugh de Halgton and Roger and Henry his Sons, under writ of novel disseizin, viz. that they had disseized the said Prior of common pasture in Halghton and Knole. Hugh pleaded that Robert de Montfort had enfeoffed him and his Sons therein ; but nevertheless judgment was given for the Prior.227 On March 18, 1284, a Convention between Philip, Prior of Wombridge, and Hugh de Haleston, about Haleston Mill, was at length concluded. Hugh gives the same to the Priory, together with a water-course which he had recovered under writ of novel disseizin against the Lords of Ydeshale, saving to Hugh the fishery of said watercourse. The whole to be held in frank and perpetual almoign, together with the right of road which Hugh had obtained by gift and charter of John de la Mare, Lord of Ydeshale. Hugh is to make no other mill within the Manor of Ydeshale, nor to grind elsewhere ; he is to allow earth for repair of the watercourse and other easements.

Also the Prior and his Successors shall, on presentation of Hugh or his heirs, always receive a fit person as a Canon of their House, and on the death of one such Nominee shall receive another, so that for ever they should have one in their house, doing services for the souls of said Hugh and his wife Alice, of his Ancestors and Successors, of Sir Robert Burnel, of Master John de Kenley, of Ralph de Hengham, and of the Chief Lords of Ydeshale, and all the faithful. And the said Canon was to take his weekly turn of Monastic duties (sit eb domadarius), and be obedient in all things, as other professed Canons of the House. To faithfully keep this peaceful adjustment (pacis reformacionem) the Prior and Hugh took personal oath, and each bound himself in case of non-observance to pay 100s. for relief of the Holy-Land, and 40s. to the Aurum Regin\u00e6, for each offence. And if it should happen that the said Mill should fall down or be destroyed, then the Prior was to be free from all his obligations. Chirographs sealed with the seals of either party were ex changed.228 The peace thus established was very transient. In 1286, a King's Writ issues to the Sheriff of Shropshire, reciting how the Prior had formerly recovered seizin of common pasture in Halegh ton and Knoll against Hugh and his Sons, and how the Prior had now petitioned the King, asserting that Hugh had redisseized him. The Sheriff is therefore to take the usual course against Hugh under the statute of Re-disseizin.\u2122 The modes in which the interests of this family of Haughton vanished from the Fee of Idsall is matter of much conjecture and only partial evidence. \u2014 We have seen that in the Convention of 1284, Alice, wife of Hugh de Haughton, and Master John de Kenley are mentioned. My idea is that Alice was Sister and eventual heir of the latter, whom we have 229 Originalia, i, 52. The penalties for Redisseizin were heavy, because it was a contempt of the King's Court. The Sta tute of Merton (20 Hen. Ill) inflicted imprisonment on the Redisseizor ; the Statute of Marlborough (52 Hen. Ill) added a fine to the Crown ; and the Statute of Westminster, which had only passed a year before the above (viz. 13 Edw.

I also imagine that Alice, after Hugh de Haughton's death, re-married to Peter de Carmarthen, and in a second widowhood granted all she had at Haughton to Sir John de Cherleton. Cer tainly the eldest son of Hugh de Haughton, whose name we have already seen was Roger, was afterwards called Roger de Kenley, and made at least one concession of property in Idesall Manor to the same Sir John de Cherleton. These ideas are borrowed from the following Deeds : \u2014 On Feb. 16 (2 Edw. II) 1309, John de Cherleton, Knight, appoints John de Cherleton Rector of Wrocwardin, William de Morton Rector of Holm, and Reginald Charles, his Attorneys to receive seizin of all lands and tenements which had belonged to Alice de Kenley, formerly wife of Peter de Kermerdin, in the vill of Halghton juxt a Ideshale, whereof the aforesaid Alice, in liege and pure widowhood, had expedited her Charter to said Sir John Cherleton.230 Again on August 4, 1309, Roger de Kenleye son of Hugh de Halghton quits to Sir John de Cherleton Knight, and his heirs, all his claims, &c. in two assarts in the Manor of Ideshale, which are called Flethay aud the Barnd.231 That Sir John de Cherleton made other and fuller purchases at Haughton and in Idsall than are implied by these Deeds, .is evident from later Documents. By a Charter of September 15, 1309, he (Sir John) grants to Alan de Cherleton his Brother, his Messuage in the vill of Halctun prop e Ydeshale and all the land which he bought from Alice de Keirmerdin.\u2014 To hold to said Alan and the heirs of his body under the Chief Lords of the Fee, rendering therefore to the said Chief Lords accustomed sendees 230 Charter at Haughton.

But if Alan should die without Heirs of his body remainder is reserved to the Grantor and his Heirs.232 About 1305, Hugh, son (and as I suppose younger son) of the last Hugh de Haughton, gave a piece of land in \" Knolle\" to Idsall Church in exchange for another piece in \" Halhton.\" I must close the present account with merely stating that after the feoffment of Alan de Cherleton (who was of Apley), by his Brother Sir John de Cherleton (of Powis), Haughton and its adjuncts continued in the line of Cherleton of Apley for several generations. A Chapel formerly belonged to the vill of Haughton. Some remains, apparently existing in the last Century, have now totally disappeared.233 DRAYTON. The principal Tenants here were of the family of Pater-Noster. The first whom I find named is William Pater-Noster, who before 1194, attests two Deeds of Walter de Dunstanvill, and who probably was identical with William de Drayton, assessed in 1209 as one living within jurisdiction of the Forest of Mount-Gilbert.234 At the Assizes of 1272, Alice de Drayton was found not to be prosecuting her suit of novel disseizin in Suffenhale (Shiffnal) against Robert de Montfort and John D'Evereus. Between 1270 and 1280, Richard Pater-Noster occurs more than once, as a witness of Deeds or as a Juror. From 1292 to 1316, William Pater-Noster occurs in similar positions, being accompanied by Thomas de Drayton in 1304, and by Richard Pater-Noster in 1316. The last occurs repeatedly from 1320 to 1348 ; and John, son of Richard Pater-Noster and Nephew of William de Steventon, occurs in 1335. Roger Hod of Drayton represented another family which held here under the Lords of Idsall. He (Roger) occurs in 1261, and from thence till 1279.

About 1219, Walter de Dunstanvill (II) assigned to Shrewsbury Abbey rents of 4s. and 2s. payable by Robert Fitz Adam and Thomas le Hog on land in Stanton.238 From about 1235 to 1265, I find a Ralph de Stanton occurring under circumstances which induce me to consider him as Tenant here. About 1269, Robert de Staunton appears in a similar position, and in 1279, Walter de Staunton seems to have had a chief interest in the vill. UPTON. There may be some doubt whether Upton were originally a member of Tong or of Idsall. Though the Lords of Idsall seem to have claimed some manorial authority here, they ultimately established an unquestioned seigneury, by composition, and not as a matter of right. The first Under-Tenants whom I can find holding Upton seem to have been Cadets of the family of Hugford. Walter, Lord of Hugford, in 1096, had a Brother Henry, who has already occurred under date of 1203,239 and who very possibly was of Upton. Again William de Hugford, whom we have men tioned as at issue with the Abbot of Buildwas in 1221,240 was, I think undoubtedly, La Zouche's Tenant here. We have also seen how Henry de Hugford became about 1228-38, a Feoffee of Roger la Zouche in Tong-Norton and Shaw.

In virtue of the latter tenure, and before the year 1231, Henry de Hugford granted the following subinfeudation here, viz. He gave, &c. to Peter, Clerk, son of Master Richard of Hydeshall, for his homage and service, and for 15s. paid down, half-a-virgate of land in Upton, viz. that which Alfwin held, with all appurtenances except the orchard and curtilage, in lieu whereof he, Henry, gave two acres elsewhere. He also gave seventeen acres of his demesne, viz. six acres in the field towards Stanton, seven acres in the field towards Hettun, on this side Blakenhul, and five acres in Binstun in the field of Brunestree : \u2014 to hold to the grantee and his heredi tary assignee, so that he commit not the premises to any House of Religion,241 rendering a rent of 3s. annually in lieu of all other services, except foreign service.242 This deed implies Henry de Hugford to have been Mesne-Lord of other parts of Upton besides the premises conveyed. Probably indeed he held the whole Township under La Zouche. I find no mention of Henry de Hugford later than 1247 ; 243 nor can I suppose that his heirs continued to possess any mesne tenure in Upton. I believe their interest here to have been purchased by the seigneural Lords of Tong or of Idsall. Certainly the 3s. rent, reserved in the above Deed, was afterwards paid by the heirs of the Feoffee to Walter de Dunstanvill (III). Following events however in chronological order, we pass to July 1, 1247, for the next notice of Upton, after Hugford's Deed. On that day, as has appeared by a Fine already cited, Alan la Zouche conveyed to Buildwas Abbey \" the whole tenement which he had in Upton, with special warranty against the capital Lords, as regarded all services, suits of the Manor-Court of Ideshale, &c. for ever.\" 244 I have already quoted the Convention, whereby the Abbot of Buildwas conceded the vi.. of Upton to Walter de Dunstanvill (III), in 1248, for an annual rent of 40s. and other considerations.245 Very soon, as I think, after he had acquired Upton, \" Sir Walter 241 An unusual caution in deeds of so early a date, \u2014 but suggested in this in stance, I imagine, by the coterminous acquisitions of Buildwas Abbey. bert de TriUeworthin, Alan de Laueleg (Lawley), John de Hinitun, Robert de Wikes, &c. 243 His attestation of a Broseley Deed between 1244 and 1249 is the latest notice of him which I can mention.

The Deed provides against any transfer of the Premises to a Religious House, and reserves \" a rent of 3s. to Sir Walter de Dunstanvill, according to that which is contained in the Charter of Sir Henry de Hugford, which Charter the Grantor (John) had given to Petronilla, when he put her in seizin of the said land.\" 248 Walter de Dunstanvill Tercius inspects, recites, and confirms this last Deed as Seigneural Lord, reserving the rent of 3s. to himself.249 The confirmation seems to have immediately followed the Charter, and to have been necessary, inasmuch as the former implied an absolute change of Tenants, not a mere subinfeudation, which last would have left John Fitz Richard Irish a mesne Tenant. Perhaps the Grantee in the last Deed is the same person who more than forty years afterwards, under the name of \" Petronilla 240 Idsall Park seems to have lain to the South of the Town, and so to have abutted on Upton to its East.

Some of these families shall be briefly noticed, e. g. \u2014 Stevinton. \u2014 John de Stevinton occurs from 1260 to 1304, as a Juror, on no less than eight occasions, and a witness of numberless deeds. He was in fact Bailiff of Idsall, and attests under that title, at least on one occasion. \u2014 About 1280, being apparently resident at Wyke, he quits to Wombridge Priory all his claim in the wood of Leftwich (or Lestwyk) .251 And John de Steventon his son and heir granted to the Priory, on April 13, 1309, a fuller acquittance of the said claim. His Charter recites previous grants in connection with the said wood of Lestwyke juxta Wombridge, viz. how in the first instance Sir Walter de Dunstanvill (III) had given his (John's) Father estovers there, and how he had afterwards concurred with Thomas Tuschet (Lord of Leegomery) in granting the wood to the Priory, how also his (John's) Father had quitted all his right therein, in favour of the Canons.252 On the same day (April 13, 1309), Philip Prior of Wombridge quitted to John de Stevinton all right of his House in the assarts, wastes, and improved lands of John de Stevinton in Ideshale Manor.253 John de Bekeburi, &c. \u2014 The Charter is dated 2 Edw.

As William de Divises, he is constantly occurring in local concerns till 1316. In 1322 and 1334, we have mention of Walter de Divises, called, in one instance, son of William senior, and appearing to be interested in Upton. Pollard. \u2014 There was an Adam Pollard, Juror, in the matter of Tong Advowson in 1220. The same name occurs repeatedly for the next fifty years. In some cases the bearer is described \" of Legh.\" About 1269, Adam Pollard appears attesting deeds with Robert his Son. Then we have Robert singly till 1316. Between 1270 and 1274, this Robert had a grant of assart-land from Sir Robert de Montfort, which he afterwards surrendered to Dame Petronilla, Sir Robert's Widow.254 IDSALL CHURCH. I have already stated how the Saxon and Collegiate Church of Iteshale was granted by the first Norman Lord of the Manor to Shrewsbury Abbey; how also the same Norman (Robert Fitz Tetbald) did, during the reign of Henry I, make such further assignation of this Advowson to the same Abbey, as that the Collegiate character of the Church came to be extinct, and its temporary Deeds is curious. The former dates itself on \" Sunday after the feast of St. Leo the Pope \" (meaning Leo the Great) ; the latter is dated on \" Sunday, before the feast of Tiburtius and Valerian.\" Each date in 2 Edward II (1309) will be found to be reducible to Sunday April 13th. 254 Blakeway MSS.

The Saxon Parish of Iteshale was, like other Saxon Parishes, extensive. It included Kemberton, Ryton, Sheriff-Hales, and Dawley, as we may gather from indications or evidences still exist ing. It was probably far more comprehensive. I have shown how the assignation of these great Saxon Churches to Monasteries of Norman foundation or patronage, resulted in an utter neglect of all spiritual cure as regarded rural districts. The Churches or Chapels which were built to remedy this state of desti tution were usually the work of Laymen. Some such were founded in the Parish of Idsall, and probably in the early half of the twelfth Century. Our present concern is however with the Parent Church. \u2014 Robert Fitz Tetbald's gift thereof to Shrewsbury Abbey was confirmed by Charters of Henry I, Stephen, Henry II, and Henry III, though at the date of the last-named confirmation the Advowson no longer appertained to the Monks. The earliest confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey by any Bishop of Chester Diocese is that of Bishop Roger de Clinton (1129-1148). It is very similar in expression to those contemporary Charters of Robert de Betun Bishop of Hereford (1131-1148) which have been quoted under Morville. The two Bishops seem to have adopted the same principles as regards the subject condition of recent Churches, and the pensions and other rights of the older establishments.255 Bishop Roger of Chester, addressing his Archdeacons and Deans (Rural Deans) and all the faithful who shall see his letter, informs them that he \" confirms the Churches or Tithes which have been given to the Brethren of St. Peter's Monastery by the faithful. The Clerks however who, by appointment of the said Brethren, preside over their Churches, are to pay the annual pensions due to the said Brethren out of such Churches, according to the mode allowed by the Bishop to the Monks. The Monks are to continue to have all tithes, as well in their own demesnes as in the demesnes the Index to \" St. Thomas the Martyr,\" meaning Becket. The latter however was not contemporary with the Prelates whom he is supposed to address. The original Charter of Confirmation begun T. d. g. Cant. Archiepiscopus, as we may learn from Harl. MS. 3868, so. 7,b. 255 There is another reason for flunking that these two Prelates acted in concert. Archbishop Theobald, confirming to Shrewsbury Abbey, addresses them toge ther (Chartulary, No. 55) ;-where however the Transcriber has attributed the Charter to Archbishop Thomas, and the Writer of"], [852, "332 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. of others, which they, previously and without dispute, enjoyed.\" \"And because,\" adds the Bishop, \" necessity compelling,256 we have consecrated Cemeteries and dedicated Chapels in certain Parishes of theirs, we enjoin that said Chapels be subject to the Mother Churches, as daughters ; and that on solemn days the people assemble not at the Chapels but at the Church ; and that the Priest of the Mother Church, if he wishes, may cause the bodies of the dead to be carried to the Cemetery thereof.\" \" We have thought proper,\" continues the Bishop, \" to confirm with the seal of our authority, all Churches, and all Tithes, and the Pensions of the underwritten Churches.\" \u2014 The list which follows, includes the \" Church of Ideshale, with its Chapels, and a pension of 30s.\" The Bishop enjoins in con clusion that the aforesaid Brethren hold these Churches, Tithes, and Pensions in peace. He threatens with anathema any one who shall in future trouble them in the matter.257 The confirmation of Bishop Walter Durdent (1149-1159), to Shrewsbury Abbey, is prefaced nearly word for word as that of his Predecessor. It would imply that he too had consecrated several Chapels and Cemeteries as a matter of necessity. As regards the rights of the Abbey under Robert Fitz Tetbald's grant, he is more specific than Bishop Roger. He confirms the \" Church of Itesall with the tithe of the Manor, and the tithe of Cambrestone, and with the Chapels pertaining to the aforesaid Church.\" His Charter makes no enumeration of Pensions.258 The confirmation of Bishop Richard Peche (1161-1182), to Shrewsbury Abbey, includes the Pension of 30s., but makes no mention of Tithes or Chapels attaching to \" Idesale Church.\"259 Between the years 1184 and 1190, Archbishop Baldwin seems to have confirmed the Charter of Walter Durdent ; and- Archbishop John Peckham visiting the Diocese of Lichfield in 1280, confirmed the Pension of 30s. as due to Salop Abbey from the \" Church of Ideshale.\"260 Long previous to this last date, the Advowson of Idsall, had returned to the Lords of the Manor.

Early in 1219, thc Abbot of Shrewsbury and Walter de Dun stanvill (II) were at issue on the subject, but seem to have arrived at some basis of agreement before the date of the following. \u2014 On October 6, 1219, the Justices at Westminster appointed thc Morrow of St. Martin (Nov. 12) for the parties to receive their Chirograph (formal fine). It was enjoined to the Abbot's Attorney that he should on that day bring with him the Charter of the Abbot and Convent concerning their Quitclaim to the Advowson of a Church, whereof there had been agreement, and Walter was ordered meanwhile to assign to the said Abbot and Convent land and rent which he had given for the said Quitclaim, viz. 30s. Walter appointed Henry de Waltham his Attorney. On the day named (says a postscript), the Abbot's Attorney pro duced the Charters and rendered them up ; so the Parties were ordered to have their Chirograph?61 This Chirograph or Final Concord is preserved. \u2014 It purports to be levied at Westminster on the Morrow of St. Martin in the 4th year of King Henry son of John (Nov. 12, 1219), between Walter de Dunstanvill, Plaintiff, by Henry de Wautham his Attorney, and Hugh, Abbot of Salopesbir, Deforciant, byThomas, a Monk, his Attorney, \u2014 concerning the Advowson of the Church of Ydesdal, whereof was suit of darrein presentment, &c. The Abbot renounced all right therein to Walter and his Heirs, saving to the Abbot the due and ancient Pension which the same Abbot was wont to receive from the said Church.262 The Salop Chartulary supplies its contingent to all but a com plete understanding of this transaction. \u2014 By a Charter therein, Walter de Dunstanvill grants to the Abbey 27s. (not 30s.) annually, viz. 10s. to be received of William Fitz Ralph of Blancmunster (Whitchurch) for the Fee which he held under the said Walter in Chalvrehalle (Calverhall), 3s. receivable from Henry de Savinton (Shavington), 2s. from Leonard de Leges, Is. from Alan the Chaplain, 4s. and 2s. from Robert Fitz Adam and Thomas le Hog for their respective Fees in Shavinton, Leges, Wyches, 261 Placita apud Westm.

I believe that none of the objections to Earl Roger's Charter are much better founded. 262 Pedes Finium, 4 Hen. Ill, Salop. Mr. Blakeway, weighing apparently the genuineness of Earl Roger's Foundation- Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, says ad versely, that \"there are no traces that either the Churches of Kemberton or 43 11."], [854, "334 IDSALL, OR SHIFFNAL. and Stanton ; also 3s. per annum from the Abbot of Buildwas for common-pasture which he enjoyed in the Manor of Hydeshale.263 In 1291, the Church of Ydesale was valued at .620. per annum over and above the Pension of 30s. which the Abbot of Salop received therefrom.264 In 1341, the Assessors of the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, in the Parish of Idsall, recited the Taxation at which the Church stood as one of 20 merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8s..), but reduced their assessment to .612. 9s. The reasons which they gave for the difference were, because the Abbot of Ruldewas had in the Parish a certain Grange, called Hatton, in which were three carucates of land and many sheep; and this tenure, though included in the Taxation, was not rateable to the Ninth ; because also the glebe lands, rents and services of Tenants, tithes of hay and pasture, oblations, and other small tithes of the Church, went to constitute the greater sum (the Taxation), and did not belong to the Ninth now granted to the King; lastly, because the corn had been destroyed by sundry storms.265 In 1534, the Abbot's pension of 30s., issuing out of Idsall Church, is duly returned among his current receipts. The Church itself, then a Vicarage, of which W'illiam Moreton was Incumbent, was valued at ,\u00a316. 5s. 10d., out of which sum 16s. 8d. was pay able for Procurations, and 2s. 6d. for Synodals. The Rectory, fermed at \u00a310. per annum, belonged to Battlefield College, as did also the Tithes of Dawley (originally a Chapelry of Idsall), which were fermed at \u00a33. 6s. 8d. 266 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

He occurs as Rector of St. Michael's before thc death of Henry II (1189), who will therefore have been his Patron. He was Cousin (cognatus) of Walter de Dunstanvill (I) of Idsall, and as such attests one of his Charters. Others he attests, simply styling himself \" Clerk\" or \" Parson of Idsall.\" \" As Master Walter de Dunstanvill\" and \"Master Walter\" he appears to have attested Charters of Hugh de Novant Bishop of Coventry, one of which will have passed about 1188, the others on Nov. 24, 1190.269\u2014 He was living in 1206, and, as Master Walter de Dunstanvill, then stanas first witness of a matter referred to high ecclesiastical arbitration by Pope Innocent III.209 \u2014 His successor 27\u00b0 (immediate or otherwise) at St. Michael's, was appointed by King John, on January 18, 1215 ; and the vacancy which four years afterwards we know to have existed at Idsall, may have originated at the same period, for during the interval no Law- Courts had been sitting, such as might have decided any pending cause of darrein presentment. On gaining the right of Advowson in 1219, Walter Lord of Idsall seems to have presented one Philip, for Philip Parson of Ideshal had, on 29 July 1221, Letters Patent of Protection till the King should be of age.271 In the middle of the thirteenth Century \u2014 Walter de Kemberton is a frequent witness of local Deeds. In one of these he is expressly styled Rector of the Church of Ideshall. Master John Joye was Rector here in 1269 ; on August 29th of which year he came to an agreement with the Pri6r of Wom bridge, abandoning a claim which he had been urging on the Prior for Tithes of certain live-stock which had apparently been only to Walter Baron of Idsall. He would have been his Brother-in-Law, i.e. Brother of the apocryphal, if not fabulous, Ursula, of whom we have already spoken.

In Trinity Term 1305, \"Adam Gest, Parson of Ideshale,\" would seem to be under prosecution of John de la Mare, Lord of Ideshale, on two matters, one for cutting down trees of the said John, the other for some trespass in regard to Deer. To the first charge Adam replied that he was only taking house-bote, to the other that at the time of the alleged offence he was Seneschal of the said Lord of Idsall.27* Master Adam Gest died Sept. 11, 1328, and on Sept. 16 follow ing, Master Thomas de Clopton was admitted to the Rectory on presentation of Dame Margaret D'Oumframvill, Lady of Badlesmere.275 In 1329, and, as I suppose, ignoring the last presentation, the King presented \u2014 Robert Swynnerton to this Living, the Patronage whereof belonged to the Crown by reason of the Barony of Bartholomew de Badlesmere being in manu Regis?'6 \u2014 This however seems to have been revoked, for on December 17, 1330, I find the Bishop readmitting Sir Thomas de Clopton, Priest, but on the presentation of King Edward III.

Shiffnal Church is a large building of several dates. It has a nave with aisles and a south porch, north and south transept, and central tower, and a chancel with a south aisle or chapel, called the Moreton Chancel. Part of the south transept, part of the north wall of the chancel, and the chancel arch, which is eastward of that under the east wall of the tower, are of a transitional style between the Norman and Early-English, and probably belong to the end of the twelfth century. The chancel arch is round, and the mouldings are some what remarkable ; in one of them, the Early-English dog-tooth ornament appears. The south porch, which has a Parvise or upper story, is of Early-English character ; perhaps with a slight tendency to theDeco rated, but I doubt not, belonging to the thirteenth century, though probably to the latter half of it. The outer door has a trefoiled arch. The bay of the aisle corresponding with the porch has a stone-ribbed vault, and is lower than the rest of the aisle, its pier arch too is not so high as the others. The nave, chancel (with the exception already noticed), and central tower are of the Decorated style ; I should say somewhat early in the fourteenth century. The north aisle has had some very late windows inserted. The central tower is very plain, and has a large stair-turret at the north-west angle. The tower stands on four piers of which the two eastern ones do not range with the eastern wall of the transepts, so that it is not so large as a tower fitted to the actual intersection : notwithstanding this, it is still massive rather than the contrary. The east window of the chancel, and those on the north and south, near the east end, have a peculiar character, and seem Early in the style. The west window I think must have been modernized. The chancel has some good Sedilia. 273 Register, B, 224 a & b.

The Moreton chancel, now screened off as a vestry, is of a later Decorated, and exhibits flowing tracery in its windows. The north transept is entirely of Perpendicular work, of the fifteenth century; and the south transept has windows and parapet of the same style. The portion of the south aisle between the porch and the transept is of very late work ; I should say of the sixteenth cen tury ; it is much wider than the western part of the aisle, or than the north aisle. The Church is on the whole in good preservation, and both the Transitional, the Early-English, and the older Decorated portions may be studied with confidence, as retaining their principal features unaltered.
