Ancient Inhabitants and Government. nPHIS county formed part of the territory of the Brigantes ; and it is \u25a0*- probable that its inhabitants were from a very early period called Cumbri, and the district Cumberland. Some of the old historians call it Caer ley Isc hire or Caerliellesfiire, from its chief town, Caerleyl or Carlisle. During the Roman government this county was part of Britannia Inferior, and was afterwards comprised within the Northern district, to which they gave the name of Valentia. Cumberland, during the Saxon Heptarchy, formed part of the Kingdom of Northumberland. About the middle of the tenth century, it was given to the King of Scots, and was sometimes under the dominion of the Kings of Scotland, and sometimes under that of the Kings of England, (as will be more particularly shewn hereafter,) till the year 1237, when it was by King Henry III. finally annexed to the crown of England. Historical Events. We have but few particulars of the military transactions of Cumberland at a very early period, although there is no doubt that it was conquered by the Romans, and that during their possession of it this county was fre* queritly the scene of active warfare between their legions and the invading armies of the Picts and Scots, against whose inroads the celebrated wall which crosses the northern part of the county was constructed. We are a 2 told"], [24, "CUMBERLAND. IV told by two of the Scottish historians'\", that Carlisle was burnt by the Scots during the absence of the Romans, in the reign of the Emperor Nero. It was probably after this event, and most likely by Agricola, that Carlisle was rebuilt as a strong frontier town, and surrounded with a wall c. The Scottish historians mention an invasion of Cumberland, by Mogal, King of the Scots, and Uniparus, King of the Picts, in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, in the early part of the second century1. One of these writers carries the claims of his nation to this county up to the time of Carausius, by whom Cumberland and Westmorland, he says, were given to King Crathlynt for his seasonable aid, and confirmed to his successor Fincormak, by Octavius, King of the Britons. It is not, however, pretended that the Scots continued in possession under this grant. We are told, that after the death of the Emperor Honorius, King Fergus asserted his claim, and in vaded these counties ; but that the Scots were defeated by Maximian, Valentinian's general, and driven beyond Antonine's waU.e It is certain, that during the Saxon Heptarchy, Cumberland formed part of the kingdom of Northumberland. The Scottish historians men tion an invasion of Cumberland in the reign of King Ethelred, in the latter part of the eighth century. In the year 875, the whole of the kingdom of Northumberland was conquered by Halfden, the Dane, who the next year divided it amongst his followers'. It is most probable that the destruction of Carlisle happened during this invasion : the exact time we do not find mentioned by any of our historians, although they all speak of it as having happened about two hundred years before, when they mention its restoration by William Rufus. We are told by the Scottish writers, that Gregory, who succeeded to the crown of that kingdom in 876, assisted the Britons in expelling the Danes from Northumberland and the adjacent counties ; that the Britons having afterwards quarrelled with their allies, invaded Scotland, but were defeated by Gregory ; that a peace ensued, by which the Britons ceded Cumberland and Westmorland to the Scots, and retired to Wales ; and that Gregory held an assembly of his nobles at Carlisle about the year 880. The Scottish and English historians are somewhat at variance as to the history of this county in the tenth century. The English historians5 tell us that Cumberland was among the provinces which submitted to Edward the b I. Fordun and H. Boethius. * See Holinshed. c See the account of Carlisle. e Holinshed's History of Scotland. P Hoveden, Higden, Wallingford, &c. f Sax. Chron. the"], [25, "CUMBERLAND. V Elder, and continued under the dominion of his son Athelstan. Fordun, on the contrary, and other Scottish writers, inform us, that Constantine King of the Scots possessed the sovereignty of Cumberland, and that in the sixteenth year of his reign (919) he gave it to Eugenius, his presumptive heir, and decreed, that thenceforward Cumberland should be held by the heir apparent to the crown of Scotland. William of Malmesbury mentions a meeting of Con stantine and Eugenius with King Athelstan at Dacre, when they did homage for their kingdoms to that monarch. Fordun relates, that in 937, after the battle of Bruningfield or Brunford, in which Constantine and Malcolm (then his heir apparent and Prince of Cumberland), with their ally Analaphus, son of Sitric, King of Northumberland, were defeated by King Athelstan, that monarch possessed himself of Cumberland and Westmorland. By a subsequent treaty, in the reign of his successor Edmund, they were ceded to the Scottish King, and it was settled that the heir apparent of Scotland should possess Cumberland as before, doing homage for it to the King of England ; Indulph, son of Malcolm, then King, was proclaimed Prince of Cumberland and heir to the crown of Scotland. Not long after this, Cumberland being in a state of rebellion, and having set up a King of the name of Dunmaile, Edmund marched with an army against him, in the year 945, laid waste and conquered the country, put out the eyes of Dunmaile's two sons, and restored Cumberland to King Malcolm, on his promise of being a faithful ally by sea and land, and Indulph was reinstated in the principality. h In the year 1000, or, as some writers say, 1001, King1 Ethelred in vaded and laid waste the county of Cumberland, because Malcolm its Prince (son of King Kenneth) had refused to pay his quota of a tribute for the wars against the Danes'. Henry of Huntingdon how ever tells us, that the Danes themselves, whose principal abode was then in Cumberland, were the objects of this expedition, and that they were defeated by Ethelred with great slaughter. Not long before the assumption of the crown of England by Canute the Dane, Othred or Uchtred, Earl of Northumberland, in alliance with the Danes, began to commit depredations in Cumberland, but was defeated, after a sharp combat, near Burgh upon the sands, by Malcolm above mentioned, then King of Scotland k. After this, the Danes and Northumbrians, being in alliance, invaded Cumberland, where they were defeated by Duncan, grandson of King Malcolm, who h Sax. Chron.; Sim. Dunelm. ; J. Bromton; Hen. Huntingdon ; R. Higden. ' See Sax. Chron.; Sim. Dunelm.; Chron. de Mailros; Higden; and Fordun. * Fordun. had"], [26, "CUMBERLAND. VI had been before invested with that principality1. After Canute had mounted the English throne, he repeatedly summoned Duncan to do his homage, but he refused, not acknowledging him as the lawful sovereign of England. Canute, in consequence, marched with his army towards Scotland, in the year 1033. Fordun relates, that as the hostile armies were on the point of engaging, an accommodation was brought about by the mediation of the prelates and other great persons, and that Cumberland was confirmed to Duncan and his successors, as heirs apparent to the crown of Scotland, they doing homage as before. The author of the Saxon Chronicle says, that an engagement took place, and that Malcolm and two Kings, his allies, were defeated. Duncan succeeded to the throne of Scotland in 1034: After his murder, and the unsuccessful attempt of his heir, Malcolm, to resist the usurper Macbeth, that Prince, with his brother Donald Bain, retired for a while to his principality of Cumberland : the latter went thence to Ireland; Malcolm remained till Edward had recovered England from the power of the Danes, and then repaired to the English court m. In the year 1053, King Edward (the Confessor) granted Cumberland and the other northern counties to Siward, Earl of Northumberland\". Not long after, Siward invaded Scotland, defeated Macbeth, and placed Duncan's heir, Malcolm Prince of Cumberland, on the throne \u00b0. Soon after the conquest a war ensued between King William and Mal colm of Scotland, who had granted an asylum to the English refugees. In the year 1069, or as some say, 1070, Malcolm passed through Cumberland, then under his dominion, and ravaged Teasdale ; meanwhile Gospatric, Earl of Northumberland, severely retaliated in Cumberland, and his sol diers by his encouragement, are said to have committed the most wanton cruelties p. About this time the conqueror gave the county of Cumberland to Ranulph de Meschines, ancestor of the Earls of Chester, who parcelled the lands out amongst his followers, and is said by Matthew of Westminster, to have begun to rebuild Carlisle. That author relates that William return ing from Scotland, by way of Carlisle, in 1072, repented of his gift, and resuming it, granted Ranulph the Earldom of Chester in its stead, and gave orders for fortifying the town. A peace had just then been con cluded between William and the Scottish King, to whom a certain tract of land, between Cumberland, Stanmore, and the Tweed, is said to have 1 Fordun. m Holinshed. n I.

Whilst William Rufus was at Car lisle, on his return from Scotland in 1092, he gave orders for rebuilding the city, which had lain in ruins from the time of its destruction by the Danes % and erecting a castle '. The King turned out Dolphin, who was sheriff of the county, and left a strong garrison at Carlisle. It seems that the buildings were not completed for several years, for we are told by some of our historians \", that King Henry I. being at Carlisle in 1 122, disbursed money for the building of the castle and the walls. The Scottish writers say, that Stephen on his assumption of the throne, summoned David, King of Scotland, to do homage for Cumberland, North umberland, and Huntingdon w. This does not seem very probable, as we have heard nothing of the Scottish claim to the northern counties since the peace with William the Conqueror. Most of our writers relate, that David, passing through Cumberland, under pretence of a peaceable visit, in the year 1135, took possession of Carlisle. This was reported to Ste phen, then at Oxford, who is said to have made answer, \" what he has taken treacherously I will by the grace of God recover victoriously*.\" John, Prior of Hexham, who probably had the best means of being informed of the transactions of that period and country, says, that David mindful of his oath to King Henry I. openly invaded England, and took possession of all the fortresses in Cumberland and Northumberland, except Bamborough 1 ; and received fealty of the nobles. Stephen, upon this intelligence, marched with his army towards the north. At the commencement of a treaty, which shortly afterwards took place, Carlisle was ceded to David1, and in the event the county of Cumberland \\ It is said that David went afterwards to Carlisle and repaired the walls and ditches. This probably was in the year 1138, at which time David occupied Carlisle with a strong garrison b. It was in this year that Alberic, the Pope's legate, arrived at Carlisle on the 25th of September, and found David attended by the bishops, priors, and barons of Scotland. The legate, who remained there three days, obtained from the Scots a promise, that all their female captives should be brought to ' Holinshed's History of Scotland. Florence of Worcester says, twelve towns and twelve marks of gold, which were confirmed in 1091 or 1092 by William Rufus. 1 Sax. Chron. Walter Hemingford ; M. Paris ; Sim. Dunelm. J.

Adulf, the bishop, was by the legate's mediation, reconciled to the King, and reinstated in his see. These circumstances are related by John, and Richard, successively priors of Hexham ; the latter mentions his having been present at the conferences. The following year happened the battle of the Standard, in which David was defeated near York. After the battle he fled to Carlisle, where he remained two days in the utmost anxiety for his son, whom he had left making an ineffectual stand against a victorious enemy. The Prince joined him in safety on the third day. In 1 1 42 we read of a quarrel between Prince Henry of Scotland, who had been invested with the principality of Cumberland, and Ralph, Earl of Chester, who claimed that county as his inheritance under King William's grant to Ralph de Meschines. This matter is said to have been compromised by an agreement, that the Earl of Chester should have the honor of Lancaster in lieu, and marry one of Prince Henry's daughters'. In 1149 we find the English and Scottish monarchs again in hostile array against each other, David being at Carlisle and Stephen at York ; but we are told that each party being afraid of the other, they both retired homewards f. The following year David, Prince Henry, (afterwards Henry II. of England,) and Ralph, Earl of Chester, entered into a league against Stephen, at Car lisle ; Prince Henry was then knighted by David, and swore that when he came to the throne he would confirm to David and his heirs his English territories. In 1152 David and his son Prince Henry, (who died that year,) met John, the pope's legate, at Carlisle E. David died at that city in 1 153 h or 115I; and was succeeded by his grandson, Malcolm IV. After Henry II. had ascended the English throne, he disregarded the oath which he had made to David, and demanded the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland of his successor K Malcolm feeling that he was unequal to cope with Henry in arms, ceded them in the year 1157, and received a confirmation of the county of Huntingdon k. The two monarchs met s The cruelties of the Scots, during David's invasion, are spoken of by Henry of Huntingdon in the following expressive language \u2014 \" Qu\u00e6cunque Scotti attingebant, omnia erant plena horroris, plena immanitatis.

IX at Carlisle the next year, as some historians relate, but parted without being able to adjust their differences, in consequence of which Malcolm was not made a knight1. Others say that the meeting was at a place near Carlisle, and that it was agreed that Malcolm should possess Cumberland and Huntingdon, and make a final release of Northumberland to King Henry. m During the civil war between Henry II. and his son, William (surnamed the Lion,) then King of Scotland, did not neglect so good an opportunity of attempting to recover the possession of Cumberland ; he invaded that county, in the year 1173, (Henry being then in France,) and besieged Carlisle, but on hearing that Richard de Lucy, the justiciary and regent during the King's absence, was advancing with a great army, he raised the siege\". The next year William again invaded Cumberland, in the month of April, and regularly invested the city of Carlisle, of which Robert de Vaux was then governor. During the siege, which lasted some months, William, with part of his army, took Liddell castle and other fortresses \u00b0. The garrison of Carlisle reduced to great straights, agreed to surrender the castle at Michaelmas, if not previously relieved p. Before the time sti pulated William was taken prisoner at Alnwick. The Scottish historians say, that at the peace which some time after ensued, Cumberland was ceded to the Scots * ; if so they certainly were not put in possession. In the year 1 1 86, King Henry appears to have been with a great army at Carlisle, for the purpose of assisting the King of Scots in subduing Roland, a rebellious subject in Galloway, who was afterwards brought by the King of Scots and his brother David, to Henry at Carlisle. r In the year 1194, the Scottish King (William) demanded of Richard I. Cumberland and the other English possessions which had been held by his ancestors5. Holinshed, in his History of Scotland, says that Richard ceded the county, on condition that the fortresses should continue in the hands of English governors. Hoveden tells us, that the demand was refused on the accession of King John, who delayed giving an answer, and meanwhile gave the government of Carlisle, which had been in the hands of Hugh Bardolf, to Wilham D'Estoteville'. The Scottish historians say that William 1 R. de Hoveden and Chron. Mailros. m See Holinshed's Chronicle of Scotland. \u2022 William Neubrig. Chron. Mailros. Holinshed. 0 Roger de Hoveden ; J.

X King of Scots did homage for Cumberland ; and that being at York on the occasion of a peace being concluded between the two nations, he surren dered it to King John, to the intent that it should be assigned to his son Alexander\". This prince succeeded to the throne of Scotland in 12 14, at the age of fifteen ; the young monarch, during John's war with the Barons, in the year 12 16, invaded Cumberland, pillaged the abbey of Holme Cul tram, and besieged Carlisle. The city was surrendered to him on the 8th of August, by order of the barons w ; but the Melrose Chronicler observes, that he did not tJieti take the castle \\ That writer, after describing the sacrilegious conduct of the Scots at Holme Cultram, adds, that more than 1,900 of them were, by the judgment of heaven, drowned in the Eden, as they were return ing with their booty. Alexander after this repaired to Louis the Dauphin, then in possession of the greater part of the kingdom, and doing homage to him, received from him and the barons of his party, a recognition of his claims to the counties of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland. y A general pacification took place soon after the accession of Henry III., in consequence of which Carlisle was surrendered to the English, and Walter de Gray, archbishop of York, was sent to take possession of the castle in 1217*. The dominion of Cumberland was to remain with Alexander3. It does not appear, however, that he was put in posses sion, for in 1235, and again in 1237, we find him making a peremptory demand of the counties of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland, as his inheritance b. The Scottish King was at length induced, at the con ference holden at York in the last-mentioned year, to give up his claim, accepting in lieu lands of the yearly value of 200// to be holden of the King of England by the annual render of a falcon to the constable of the castle of Carlisle on the festival of the Assumption. The formidable power of the Pope, whose legate was present at the conference, is supposed to have had considerable weight on Alexander's mind in deciding him to accept of so small a compensation. This agreement finally terminated the Scottish dominion in the northern counties of England -y but the feuds between the two kingdoms continued u See Holinshed's History of Scotland. w See Ridpath's Border History, p. 124. x Fordun says, that it was at length taken, after a long siege, and that Alexander afterwards repaired and strengthened the fortifications. * Ridpath. z Chron.

XI with unabated violence for more than three centuries : the resumption of the manors which had been granted to Alexander, at no very distant period, added fresh fuel to the flame. This county was seldom long exempt from the horrors of invasion, or the cruelties and depredations of raids and forays. The only means by which any thing like security for life or property could be obtained, were a most vigilant system of watching and the construction of numerous fortresses. Almost every gentleman's house, particularly on the sea-side or near the borders, had its fortified tower, sufficiently capacious to afford refuge to its inhabitants. In some parishes the church-towers were so constructed as to answer this purpose J. It was not till the happy union of the kingdoms by the accession of James I. to the English throne, that the inhabitants of both borders (for the Cumbrians were not remiss in retaliating upon their Scottish neighbours) were relieved from the miseries of hostile inroads c. The regular border-service and the border-laws were instituted in the reign of Edward I. : the former for the purpose of keeping a strict watch f, appointing beacons5, regulating the musters, i d See the account of ancient church architecture. e We find the inhabitants praying aid of parliament on account of their towns and villages, the clergy on account of their churches being burned. In 142 1 they represent all the country within twenty miles of the borders to have been so depopulated by war, pestilence, and emi gration, that where formerly there had been 100 able men, there were then scarcely 10, and those who remained much impoverished by imprisonment and the exactions of the Scots.

In the month of October this year, AVallace with his victorious army entered Cumberland and summoned Carlisle, but finding that the garrison were determined to defend it to the last extremity, they marched forwards and laid waste the forest of Inglewood, and the whole of Allerdale, as far as Cockermouth. \u25a0 Not long after the battle of Falkirk, in which the Scots under Wallace were defeated in 1298, King Edward came with his army to Carlisle\", where he is said to have held a parliament on the 1 5th of September * : in the year 1300 he set forward on a new expedition against Scotland about mid summer p, and marched with his army to the western borders, by way of Carlisle. In the year 1 306, Robert Brus, Earl of Carrick q, having started up as a new asserter of the independence of his country, and having been crowned King of Scotland, King Edward appointed a general rendezvous of his army at Carlisle' on Midsummer day, to accompany his son Prince Edward to Scotland. The king with his queen, having been some time in Northumberland, arrived at Carlisle about the 28th of August, and staid there till the 10th of September. The remainder of that month they spent in Northumberland, and about the 1st of October arrived at Lanercost, where, after another short visit to Carlisle, they continued, on account of the infirm s state of the king's health, till the 28th of February following. On the 1st of March the king and queen removed to Kirk Cambock, and thence on the 4th to Linstock Castle, where they were entertained with their whole court for six days, by John Halton, then Bishop of Carlisle '.

The King, though daily declining in health, resolved to prosecute his expedition against Scotland, and summoned all who owed fealty or service, to a general rendezvous at Carlisle on the 8th of July. On the 28th of June the king left Carlisle, and being then in so weak a state that he was unable to travel more than two miles a day, halted that night at Caldecote, a hamlet in the parish of St. Mary u. He reached Burgh on the Sands on the 5th of July, and there closed his life and glorious reign on the 7th x. At this place is a pillar commemorative of the event. y An express having been sent to Prince Edward, he reached Carlisle on the nth, and the next day went, accompanied by a great number of the nobles and prelates, then assembled at Carlisle, to Burgh, to mourn over his father's remains. On the 13th he received the homage and fealty of almost all the great men of the kingdom, in the castle at Carlisle z. The weak and dissolute young monarch then returned into Scotland, but soon abandoned his father's favourite measure of vigorously prosecuting the war with that nation. He came to Carlisle on his return from Scotland in the month of September, and then restored Anthony Bee, who had been under his father's displeasure, to the Bishoprick of Durham. * In the year 1 3 1 1 , Robert Brus twice made an inroad into Cumberland, and ravaged Gilsland ; during the second inroad the Scottish king stayed three days at Lanercost with his army, and imprisoned several of the monks, but set them at liberty before his departure. b In 13 14, after the disastrous battle of Bannockburn, Edward Brus, brother of the Scottish King, and Sir James Douglas, advanced into England as far as Richmond in Yorkshire, and on their return burnt Kirkoswald, and passed by Lanercost into Scotland0: this was in the autumn. About the Christmas following the Scots made another inroad into Gilsland, in all their expedi tions exacting large tributes from the inhabitants\".

Walsingham says that the whole country was at this time ravaged from Carlisle to York, and that there was no safety for the English, except in the principal garrison towns. The western part of Cumberland also was ravaged during this invasion, the monastery of St. Bees spoiled, and their manor places of Cleator and Stainborn destroyed f. In 1 3 19, the Scots under James Douglas and Thomas Randolf, laid waste Gilsland and other parts of Cumberland5. In 1322 Robert Brus again invaded England, burnt Rose Castle, spoiled the abbey of Holme-Cultram, where his father lay buried, wasted all the western side of Cumberland to Duddon Sands, and entered Lancashire ; on his return he encamped with his army for five days near Carlisle \\ King Edward II. in return invaded Scotland, but was forced to abandon his expedition in consequence of the want of provisions, and the dysentery raging in his army. After his return to England, Robert Brus again entered Cumberland, and lay with his army for five days at Beaumont, about three miles from Carlisle, sending detachments to lay waste the country on every side'. This year Sir Andrew de Hercla, in recompence of his meritorious services, was created Earl of Carlisle, and Lord Warden of the Marches, but being accused the next year of a treason able correspondence with the Scots, he was degraded from all his honours, and executed at Carlisle. Soon after the accession of Edward III. Lord Ufford and Lord Moubray were sent with a reinforcement to Anthony Lord Lucy, then governor of Carlisle : in the month of July following (1327) the Earl of Murray and Lord Douglas, with a large army, entered England near Carlisle, and marched through Cumberland, laying waste the country as they went, towards the Bishopric of Durham\". Edward Baliol, who in 1332, made an attempt, which at first promised success, to recover his father's crown, after narrowly escaping assassination at Annan, fled to Carlisle, where he was hospitably received by Lord Dacre, then its governor '. The following year Lord Dacre's demesnes in Gilsland were ravaged by Lord Archibald Douglas, who staid four days with his army in Cumberland m.

Thence, large reinforcements having joined them from the northern counties, they made a successful incursion into Scotland, under the com mand of Baliol, and returned to Carlisle0. In 1335, King Edward III. having determined on an expedition against Scotland, marched with his army from Carlisle on the nth day of Julyp. In the year 1337 the Scots entered England at Arthuret, and marching eastward, destroyed about 20 villages, and carried off a great booty q. Dur ing a subsequent invasion the same year, they surrounded Carlisle, and burnt the suburbs, with the hospital of St. Nicholas. They burnt Rose Castle also a second time, and wasted the surrounding country'. This was most pro bably in the absence of the Bishop, John Kirby, who was much distinguished for his military prowess, and had twice invaded Scotland that year, with several English nobles in the interest of Edward Baliol. In the year 1342, a large army of Scots invaded Gilsland, and having penetrated as far as Penrith, burnt that town, with several neighbouring villages. In the autumn of 1 345, the Scots, under the command of Sir William Douglas, burnt Carlisle and Penrith, and returned through Gilsland, with a great booty. They were much annoyed during their incursion by a small force collected by Bishop Kirby and Sir Thomas Lucy. The Bishop and Sir Robert Ogle had a sharp skirmish with the enemy : the prelate was un horsed during the encounter, but having recovered his saddle, continued to fight valiantly, and contributed greatly to the victory5. The next year David Brus in person invaded Cumberland, and besieged Liddell Castle, which was taken by assault : Sir Walter Selby, the governor, was beheaded. It is said that he begged for time to make his confession, but that it was refused ' . The Scots then plundered the monks of Lanercost of their treasure and jewels, and after committing great destruction, marched by way of Naworth Castle to Ridpath u. In the year 1380, although there was at that time a truce subsisting be tween the two nations, the borderers continued to make mutual inroads upon each other. In the summer of that year the Scots laid waste the forest of Inglewood, and having surprised the town of Penrith, which was very full, it being the time of the fair, they put numbers of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried off many prisoners and a great booty x, but paid dearly for it, taking home with them the infection of a pestilence then raging, 0 Chron.

They were deterred from continuing the siege by a report that a numerous army was coming to its relief*. In or about the year 1383, we find the abbot of Holme-Cultram paying a large sum of money to the Earl of Douglas to save that monastery from being burned by his army. b In 1385 the Scots, assisted by the French, invaded Cumberland, ravaged the estates of the Baron of Greystock and the Musgraves, and made an ineffectual attack upon Carlisle c. In the year 1387, the Earl of Douglas, the Earl of Fife, and other Scottish nobles, invaded Cumberland, wasted the country with sue and sword, surprised Cockermouth, where they remained three days, and carried off Peter Tilliol, the sheriff of the county11. During this inroad another attack was made on Carlisle, and the suburbs burnt. Sir William Douglas (a natural son of Archibald Lord Douglas) is said to have performed prodigies of valour on this occasion ; particularly in an encounter on a drawbridge in the outworks, two feet wide, with three armed citizens, one of whom he killed and overcame the others'. It seems to have been the same year that a battle is said to have happened near Carlisle, in which the Scots lost 1,100 men; and their whole army, consisting of 30,000, were driven across the river, a few days before the festival of St. Lawrence '. In 1388, the Scots, making an inroad into Gilsland, are said to have conducted themselves with the greatest bar barity on Lord Dacre's demesne, having set fire to some houses in which they had shut up more than 200 decrepid persons, women, and children. g Except that Cockermouth Castle is said by John Hardyng to have been yielded to King Henry IV., we find no further mention of the city of Car lisle or this county till the year 1461, when an army of Scots, in the interest of Henry VI. besieged Carlisle and burnt tlie suburbs \\ This is the only circumstance concerning the wars between the houses of York and Lancaster (connected with Cumberland) spoken of by any of our historians.

In a letter to Cardinal Wolsey, without date\", Lord Dacre gives an account of an inroad of the Elwards, Nixons, Armstrongs, and Crosers, inhabiting the debatable ground, to the number of 300, who slew eleven of his servants, and took others prisoners ; and complains, that neither the garrison at Bewcastle nor that at Carlisle, although warned, contributed any aid. In the year 1537, Nicholas Musgrave and others being in rebellion against King Henry VIII. besieged Carlisle, but were repulsed by the citizens.

The rebel Lords advanced from Northumberland as far as Na worth ; but finding, on a conference with Leonard Dacre, that their cause was hopeless, they dispersed their army\". This was in December; in the early part of the following year, Leonard Dacre, claimant of the baronies of Gilsland and Greystock, having appeared in arms, with a force of 2,000 foot and 600 horse, raised from among the tenants of those baronies, garrisoned Naworth and Rockliffe Castles. Lord Hunsdon, who was sent against him, approached Naworth, then possessed by Dacre, on the 20th of February; but instead of attacking that castle, as was expected, passed on towards Carlisle; which Dacre observing, sallied out of the castle with 1,500 foot and 600 horse, and having drawn up his force on a high moor near the Gelt, attempted to stop Lord Hunsdon's progress to Carlisle. Dacre was defeated, and fled with his horsemen to Scotland. Lord Hunsdon marched on to Carlisle, and the next morning sent to take possession of Naworth, Rock cliffe, and Greystock Castles, which were put in safe custody for the Queen.0 The last hostile inroad before the union of the Kingdoms, happened im mediately after the accession of James I. when a party of Scots, between two and three hundred, entered Cumberland, and committed various depredations as far as Penrith. James, who was then at Berwick on his way to London, sent Sir William Selby, governor of that place, 'with a detachment of the garrison, who soon dispersed the invaders, and sent those who fell into his hands to the castle at Carlisle p. The two countries being now united under the government of one monarch, and frontier towns no longer necessary, King James reduced the garrisons at Carlisle and Berwick.\"1 Soon after his accession, King James took active measures for settling the peace of the borders, and appointed George Clifford Earl of Cumberland Lord Warden of the Marches.

One of his first measures was to banish the Grames or Grahams, a numerous clan, occupying what was called the debatable ground' near the river Eske. This clan had long been an annoy ance to his own subjects, and not less so, as it appears, to their Cumberland neighbours5, who made bitter complaints against tnem, in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, at which time Walter Grame of Netherby, the head of the clan, (being the same person whom Camden speaks of as distinguished for his valour among the borderers,) with about 400 of his friends and their dependents, most of them of the name of Grame, bound themselves to Lord Scrope, then Lord Warden, to be answerable for their good conduct \\ The King, in his proclamation, states it to have been the Grames* own desire that they should be removed. In 1606 there was an assessment on the county of Cumberland, to defray the expences of \" the transplantation of the Grames.\" They embarked at Workington : most of them were sent to Ireland ; others to the Netherlands. We do not find any mention, during the whole of these proceedings, of \" Old Mr. Fergus Grame of Plumpe,\" the father of Sir Richard, the first baronet, and ancestor of the present Netherby family, who, as appears by the parish register, was buried at Arthuret, in 1625. We may conclude, therefore, that he was a more peaceably disposed person than others of his family, and was suffered to remain quietly at home. It is a pleasing reflec tion to contrast the prosperity of this district under its late and present owner, (in whom has centered the whole of the property which belonged to the once numerous clan of the Grahams) with the scenes of rapine and bloodshed that prevailed hi it during the times of their remote ancestors. Some of the banished Grames having returned to England, King James issued a proclamation for apprehending them in 1614. ' This debatable ground in the Western Marches comprised a considerable district of land on each side of the borders, to which both nations laid claim ; in this district were numerous villages, the inhabitants of which were engaged in perpetual warfare. Lord Dacre, then Lord Warden of the Marches, in a letter to Cardinal Wolsey, dated March 5, . . . . , strongly recom mends, that Canonby having been claimed by Scotland should be wasted and destroyed. \" As for the rest of the debatable ground,\" says he, \" that was unbrynte and destroyed when I was there, I have caused miche of it to be brynte and destroyed ; and shall not faill, God willing, soo too procede from tyme to tyme, until it be clerly waiste, without one house or holde standing within it.\" Cotton.

Fuller says, that \" when at their greatest height, the moss-troopers had two enemies, the laws of the land and Lord William Howard of Naworth. He sent many of them to Carlisle, to that place where the officer always does his work by day-light.\" Fuller, however, attributes their decay and ruin to the wisdom, valour, and dili gence of his great grandson Charles, the first Earl of Carlisle, \" who routed these English tories with his regiment. His severity to them,\" saith he, \" will not only be excused but commended by the judicious. Such was the success of this noble Lord's severity, that he made a thorough reformation among them, and the ring leaders being destroyed, the rest were reduced to legal obedience, and so, I trust, will continue.\" It was not, however, till some time after the union in Queen Anne's reign that the inhabitants of the borders had attained to a state of perfect security. x u One singular species of plunder or exaction ( which had existed before the accession of King James) was a contribution called black mail, paid in cattle, frequently demanded by the borderers of their own neighbours as well as of the Scots, for the protection of the rest of their property. An act of parliament was passed 43 Eliz. which made the exacting of this contribution, felony without benefit of clergy. w Nine of these dogs were ordered to be kept. In the introduction to Nicolson and Burn's History of Westmorland and Cumberland, is a note of what parishes were severally found to provide and maintain them. x Nicolson and Burn observe, that the only species of theft peculiar to the borders, now remaining, is where a man and woman steal each other. \" They hasten to the borders. The kindred of one side or the other, sometimes rise and follow the fray. But the parties fugitive commonly outstrip them, pass over into the opposite march, without any hostile attempt, get lovingly married together, and return home in peace.\" 1 2 Carlisle"], [44, "XXIV CUMBERLAND. Carlisle and Bewcastle were garrisoned in the year 1639, on account of the commotions in Scotland ; in the month of June 1640, there being an immediate expectation of the Scottish army entering Cumberland, orders were given for a strict watch, for preparing the beacons, and all other pre cautions against an invasion. The garrison at Carlisle was kept up till the month of October 1641, when pursuant to a treaty with the Scots, it was disbanded. Y Not long after the commencement of the civil war between King Charles and his parliament, (in the latter end of 1642) the northern counties asso ciated and raised forces for the King. This county does not appear to have been much the scene of hostilities during the contest. The Cumber land forces distinguished themselves in Lancashire, under the command of Colonel Hudleston in 1643. It appears that the King had an army in Cumberland and Westmorland in 1644, which was joined by Prince Rupert after the battle at Marston-moor z. During that year ' a force was first raised in Cumberland for the parliament, which approached Carlisle ; but being pursued by the posse comitatus, toward Abbey Holme, fled and dis persed in all directions D. We are told that the Marquis of Montrose having been pursued by the Earl of Calendar out of Scotland retreated to Carlisle ; that they had a skirmish in the town on the 1 7th of May 1644, and that Montrose was obliged to seek shelter in the castle, where he was straightly besieged c. It is probable the Earl soon abandoned the siege, as we find nothing of the capture of the castle, and on the 22d, Lord Calendar was employed in the siege of Morpeth. d After the taking of York in July, Sir Thomas Glenham with the garrison from that place retired to Carlisle, where he took the command. About the latter end of September, Sir Philip Musgrave and Sir Henry Fletcher were defeated near Great-Salkeld e, by the Scottish army under General Lesley, and with difficulty escaped to Carlisle f. Lesley did not then stay to besiege Carlisle, which gave the townsmen an opportunity to lay in a stock of provisions, and fill their granaries with the produce of the harvest then getting in.

XXV Lesley returned with part of the Scottish army into Cumberland and be sieged Carlisle. The garrison and the townsmen were put on short allow ance about the end of February, but although they suffered almost unex ampled distresses, they held out till all hopes of relief had vanished by the fatal issue of the battle of Naseby, and did not surrender till the 25th of June 1645, when they obtained the most honourable terms. Scaleby castle had been surrendered in the month of February. In the month of October the same year, Lord Digby and Sir Marmaduke Langdale were defeated Jby Sir John Brown, then Governor of Carlisle, at Carlisle sands : their small army was dispersed and themselves obliged to fly to the Isle of Man. f From the time of the capture of Carlisle by General Lesley's army, it had been garrisoned by the Scots, of whom the parliament, ere long, grew jealous. In May 1646, it was resolved that they had no further occasion for their services. A sum of money was voted them, one half to be paid when they had evacuated all the English garrisons, the other half when the whole of their army had returned to Scotland. Carlisle was not evacuated till tlie month of December ; Whitelock speaks of the castle as being \" upon slighting,\" in the month of February following. About the time that an army was raised in Scotland, under the Duke of Hamilton, for the purpose of restoring the power of the fallen Monarch, in 1648, Sir Thomas Glenham and Sir Philip Musgrave took possession of Carlisle by surprise, on or about the 28th of April. Soon after this, about 3000 foot and 700 horse raised in Cumberland and Westmorland, under the command of Sir Marmaduke Langdale, held a rendezvous upon a heath five miles from Carlisle ; where two days afterwards, they were joined by 500 horse from the bishopric of Durham. General Lambert having the com mand of the parliamentary army in the North, took Penrith on the 1 5th of June, and made that place his head-quarters for a month. Sir Mar maduke Langdale retired upon Carlisle. The citizens are said to have petitioned Sir Philip Musgrave, that his army might not be received within the walls, dreading the recurrence of another famine. E De tachments of Lambert's army took Greystock, Rose, and Scaleby castles. h f Whitelock and Rushworth. \u00ab Rushworth. 11 Mr. T. Denton in his MS. History of Cumberland, says, that Greystock and Rose Castlci were burnt by Major Cholmley in 1648. The Major, it is probable, commanded the detachment of Lambert's army which took those castles. Vol. IV. d The"], [46, "CUMBERLAND. XXVI The beginning of July, the Duke of Hamilton arrived at Carlisle, super seded Sir Philip Musgrave, and gave the command of that garrison to Sir William Levingston. The Duke's forces, which were quartered about Wig ton and Carlisle, formed a junction with Sir Marmaduke Langdale at Rose Castle, making altogether about 12,000, and marching southward, General Lambert quitted Penrith at their approach on the 15th of July, and retreated to Westmorland. Cumberland is said to have been much harrassed and plundered by Major General Munroe, who followed the Duke of Hamilton out of Scotland with 6000 men, both in his march southward, and on his retreat after the unfor tunate battle of Preston. Sir Philip Musgrave, about this time, returned with his forces to Carlisle ; but the governor was unwilling to admit him. Cockermouth Castle being held for the Parliament by Lieutenant Bird, was besieged by a body of 500 Cumberland royalists in the month of August 1648; the siege continued till the 29th of September', when it was re lieved by Lieutenant Colonel Ashton, sent out of Lancashire by Cromwell for that purpose. On the first of October, Carlisle was surrendered to Cromwell, pursuant to a treaty made some time before, between the Marquis of Argyle and General Munroe. A garrison of 800 foot and a regiment of horse were left there ; the garrison was afterwards made to consist of 600 foot and two regiments of horse of 600 each, for the purpose of suppressing the insurrec tions of the Moss-troopers. The county, in consequence petitioned parlia ment, that this garrison might be maintained by the kingdom at large, and that they might only contribute their quota. In this and subsequent peti tions, the state of the county is described as most lamentable : it is said that families of the first quality had scarcely bread sufficient for their con sumption, and no beverage but water ; that many died in highways for want of sustenance ; and that there were 30,000 families, who had neither seed nor bread corn, nor money to buy any. A collection was ordered for their relief by parliament, but it proved very inefficient k. It appears that a large garrison was kept up at Carlisle for a considerable time. The governor sent a detachment of 1000 men into Scotland, who took some small forts there in December 1650: in June 1651, upon a party of Scots approaching Carlisle, Major General Harrison sent 2000 men in pursuit of them.

XXVII In the month of November 171 5, a body of the rebels under the command of Mr. Forster, who had a general's commission from the Pretender, entered England from the Scottish borders, and marched to Brampton, where they proclaimed the Pretender ; thence they continued their inarch to Penrith, and took possession of that town, the Posse Comitatus, amounting to 1 2,000 men, flying at their approach. m The last time that this county was the scene of military operations, was during the rebellion in 1745, when Charles Stuart put in execution his rash project of invading England. The advanced post of his army entered Cumberland on the 8th of November, near Longtown, and encamped the next day on a moor within four miles of Carlisle, where the militia of Cum berland and Westmorland were in garrison. The main army having joined them on the 1 oth, they approached Carlisle, and summoned the town. Before they commenced any serious attack, the army removed to Brampton on the nth, and staid there till the 13th. Charles Stuart himself slept on the 9th at Mr. Murray's, in a village three miles south of Carlisle ; on the 1 oth at Black-hall, in St. Mary's parish, and on the nth went to Warwick HalL On the 1 3th his army commenced the siege of Carlisle, which, being weakly garrisoned, surrendered on the 15th. On the 21st the van of the rebel army having left a garrison in Carlisle, marched to Penrith, on their route south ward ; Charles himself arrived at Penrith with the remainder of his army on the 22d. It is well known that they advanced as far as Derby, from which place, after holding a council of war, they made a hasty retreat towards Scotland, followed by the Duke of Cumberland. The main body of their army reached Penrith on their return the 17th of December, and a skirmish happened on the 1 8th, between their rear and a part of the Duke of Cumberland's forces, at Clifton. On the 20th the rebels quitted Carlisle, having left a garrison in the castle, and made a hasty retreat into Scotland. The Duke of Cumberland arrived at Carlisle on the 21st, but having been obliged to wait for some cannon which was to come from White haven, did not erect his batteries till the 28th, and on the 30th the city was surrendered to him at discretion. \" During the American war, in the year 1778, a daring attempt was made on the port of Whitehaven, by the noted pirate, Paul Jones. It was rendered harmless in consequence of one of his men having deserted and given the alarm to the inhabitants. \u00bb Smollet.

The county of Cumberland has from an early period been divided into five districts, called Wards, a term pecidiar to the border counties. These wards have always been distinguished by their present names, the Wards of Allerdale above Derwent ; Allerdale below Derwent ; Cumberland- Ward, Leath-Ward, and Eskdale- Ward. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Carlisle, and a circuit of 1 5 miles round, was given to St. Cuthbert, Bishop of Durham, and his successors, by King Egfrid, in 685. In the year 1133, King Henry I. erected Carlisle into a see ; giving its bishops the jurisdiction of the greater part of Cumberland and Westmorland. The ward of Allerdale above Derwent, is in the diocese of Chester, which see was erected by King Henry VIII. in 1541. The parish of Alston-moor is in the diocese of Durham, and that of Over- Denton, is said to have been formerly in the same diocese. There is only one archdeacon under the see of Carlisle, who is styled archdeacon of Carlisle. In the Liber Regis, that part of Cumberland which is within the see of Carlisle, is divided into only two deaneries, Allerby, Alnedale or Allerdale, and Carlisle ; there are now three deaneries, Carlisle, Penrith, and Wigton, and it appears by Mr. T. Denton's MS. that this division had taken place before 1686. The deanery of Carlisle includes the whole of Cumberland and Eskdale wards, except Wigton and Kirkbride ; the deanery of Wigton comprises those parishes and the whole ward of Allerdale below Derwent. The deanery of Penrith includes the whole of Leath-Ward except Alston moor, which is in the diocese of Durham and deanery of Corbrigg. Camden, on the authority of Wolsey's list, gives the number of parishes in this county as 58. Many chapelries have since that time been deemed parishes. Mr. T. Denton makes the number of parishes 1 08, including Ennerdale, Esk dale, and Loweswater, which are still deemed chapelries of St. Bees ; Cocker mouth, Embleton, and Lorton, which are esteemed chapelries to Brigham ; and Flimby, but omitting the depopulated parishes of Carlatton and Kirk- Cambock. The following table, which makes the number of parishes 1 04, corresponds with Nicolson and Burn, except that they treat of Over and Nether-Denton as one parish. Flimby has been by some esteemed extra-parochial, by others a member of Holme-Cultram. Nicolson and Burn esteem it as a chapel of Camerton, and it is so called in the Liber Regis.

The same order had a nunnery at Armathwaite, in the Parish of Croglin, the site of which is now called Nun nery, and another at Seaton alias Lekelay, in the parish of Bootle. The Cistertians had an abbey at Calder, and another at Holme-Cultram. The Black friers and Grey friers had each a convent in Carlisle, and the Grey friers another at Penrith. There is said to have been a religious house of ancient foundation at Carlisle, another at St. Bees, and a third at Dacre, destroyed by the Danes : David, King of Scotland, is said to have founded a nunnery at Carlisle : of these monasteries we have no further par ticulars. The churches of Greystock and Kirk-Oswald were collegiate. At Carlisle was an Hospital for 1 3 lepers, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and at Wigton an hospital and free chapel dedicated to St. Leonard. Boroughs and Market-Towns. This county returns only six members to parliament ; two knights of the shire : two burgesses for Carlisle, and two for Cockermouth. Both Cocker mouth and Egremont sent burgesses to the parliament at Westminster, in the 23d year of Edward I. It does not appear that Egremont ever received another summons. Cockermouth was restored in the year 1640, and has ever since returned two members. Mr. T. Denton enumerates 15 market-towns in this county in 1688. He has omitted Hesket : probably the market was established, and the place acquired its present name of Hesket-Newmarket, since that time. The market is now very inconsiderable. Maryport market is of course of later date, the town having been long since built. The markets at Workington also have been established within the last century.

The population of this county at an early period varied greatly, it being at times almost depopulated by the ravages of war and pestilence. In 1421 we find the men of Cumberland representing to parliament that all the country within twenty miles of the borders had been so depopulated by war, pestilence, and emigration, that where formerly there were 100 able men, there were then scarcely tenf. Carlisle appears to have been uncommonly populous in the fourteenth century, if we were to regard the number of houses burnt down in 1390, (1,500 in the three principal streets) ; yet we find that the number of lay persons upwards of fourteen years of age, (ex clusive of paupers), in 1377, was only 678. The total number of persons then in the county of that description, was 10,841 ?. Mr. T.Denton estimates the total number of inhabitants in 1688, at 66,375. Many thousands have been added to the population of the county since that time by the growth of the now flourishing towns of Whitehaven, Maryport, and Workington, and the great increase of inhabitants caused by the flourishing state of the manufactories at Carlisle. The total number of inhabitants in the county in 1801 was 117,230; in 1811, 133,744, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods, making an increase during the space of ten years, supposing the enumeration to have been made at both periods with f Rot.

It is certain that in a state of peace the healthiness of the climate, and its consequence, the great longevity of the inhabitants, must, whilst the county is free from pestilential infec tion, especially since the discovery and use of vaccine inoculation, occasion a rapid and great increase of population.

XLV Longevity. Having observed during our visit to Cumberland, in the early part of our progress, numerous instances of longevity recorded on the gravestones, and understanding that it was the generally received opinion, that the inhabit ants of this county were remarkably long-lived, during the remainder of our journey we resolved to make more particular inquiries on the subject. On examining some of the parish registers, we found that in consequence of an official recommendation from the arc!. deacon about the year 1771, the ages of all persons buried within the diocese of Carlisle had from that time been specified. This circumstance was peculiarly favourable to the inquiry, and wherever we had an opportunity, particularly in the towns, we made notes of the total number of burials, and the number of persons buried who had attained the age of fourscore, and those who had attained the more advanced age of 90, and upwards. Since our return we have been favoured with similar notes from other parishes in that diocese. We had quitted that part of the county which is in the diocese of Chester before we com menced these enquiries, but have since learnt, that the ages had been specified in many of the registers of that part of the county several years before they were entered in those of the diocese of Carlisle. The clergy of Whitehaven, Workington, Egremont, and some of the smaller parishes in the diocese of Chester, have favoured us with notes from their registers. The result of our enquiries on this subject, contained in the following tables, will be found to justify most fully, the prevailing opinion of the longevity of the inhabitants of Cumberland. In the parish of Egremont, in which the population appears to have been nearly stationary for the last ten years (consisting of about 1550 persons) we can ascertain with certainty, that about one in 42 have died annually. It is not easy to make calculations of this kind with any degree of accuracy, both on account of the fluctuation of population, and the difficulty of pro curing the number of deaths among the dissenters, where they have ceme teries. The favourable circumstance of the ages having been specified in the parish-registers, affords a facility of ascertaining most satisfactorily, in a very large given number of deaths, the proportion of those persons who have attained to the age of 80, 90, &c. ; and the result is very curious and remark able *. The present population of each parish in which the calculation has been made, is annexed in the ensuing table. * The general average proportion of those who attain the age of eighty, is said to be one in thirty-two ; and in London, one in forty.

LI The most extraordinary instance of longevity in a native of Cumberland is that of John Taylor, born at Garragill, in the parish of Aldston-moor, a parish by no means remarkable for the long lives of its inhabitants, the greater part of whom are labourers in the lead-mines. Taylor had been em ployed in these mines from his childhood ; he went below ground at eleven years of age, and was fourteen or fifteen at the time of the great solar eclipse, called in the North Mirk Monday, which happened March 29th, 1652. From that time till 1752, except for two years, during which he was em ployed in the mint at Edinburgh, he wrought in the mines at Aldston, at Blackhall in the bishopric of Durham, and in various parts of Scotland. In the year 1767, an account of him was sent to Dr. Lyttelton, Bishop of Car lisle, by Mr. J. Walker of Moffat, and communicated to the Society of An tiquaries ; he was then living in the neighbourhood of Moffat, near the Lead hills mines, in which he had been employed several years. Upon applying to the Rev, Alexander Johnson, minister of Moffat, he informed us, that John Taylor's residence was in the parish of Crawford ; that as no regular register of burials was kept in that parish, the exact date of his death could not be ascertained, but that according to the best information that he could procure, it happened some time in the year 1772. John Taylor married when he was between sixty and seventy, and had nine children by his wife, who died in 1758 : two of his sons were living at Lead-hills in 1767 a : at the time of his decease he must have been 135 years of age. The number of persons in Cumberland\", whose ages have been from 90 to 99 inclusive, since the ages have been noted in the parish registers, is above 1,120; of these about one-fourth have attained or exceeded the age of 95. In the parish of Bewcastle, where the average number of burials is about sixteen, and the population about 1,070, there occurred, within the space of forty years, three persons of 95 years of age, five of 97, one of 98, and one of 99, besides those of 100 years of age or upwards, noticed in the table. Generally speaking, the inhabitants of Cumberland, who live to this protracted age, are healthy and strong, capable of performing the functions of their several stations, and even of partaking of the amusements of life, almost to its close. Elston Cowman, a farmer of Distington, who died in 18 14, at the age of 98, was appointed collector of the property-tax at 90, and executed the office ably and faithfully for some a Arch\u00e6alogia, vol.1, p. 231 \u2014 233. b The number of which our notes express the exact age is 753 ; of these, 191 were 95 years of age or upwards ; of the remainder, we only know that their ages were from 90 to 99 inclusive ; but dividing the number in the same proportion, those who have attained the age of 95 will be about one-fourth. g 2 years."], [72, "CUMBERLAND. LII years. Thomas Elliot, a poor man, who died at Arlochden, in 1785, at the age of 104, was seen by our conespondent, at Arlochden fair, whither he had walked some miles, stripped of his coat, hat, &c. dancing and singing with great glee. John Taylor, before spoken of, worked in the mines till he was about 115. Some instances of remarkable contemporary longevity, may be here noticed : William Bowman, of Dearham, who died in 1800, at the age of 87, and his wife, who survived him, and died at the ao-e of 91, lived together 64 years. Anthony and Isabella Walker, who died at the ages of 82 and 84, lived together as man and wife in the same house 61 years : Elizabeth the daughter of Anthony Walker married Henry Bacon, and she and her husband lived 62 years in the same house as man and wife, dying at the ages of 96 and 82. Mr. John Mirehouse of Miresyke, in Loweswater, who died in 1771, at the age of 92, and his wife, who died in 1776, at the age of 97, lived more than 68 years together. Mr. Wright, the late curate of Matterdale, died at the age of 85 ; his wife, who survived him, at 92. In Moresby church-yard is a memorial for Robert Steele, aged 90, and Jane his wife, aged 95. John Robinson, of Little-Bampton, died in 1789, aged 100 ; his wife in 1791, aged 91. The Rev. Thomas Jefferson, who died in 1768, at the age of 95, was minister of Cockermouth 68 years. The Rev. George Braithwaite, who died curate of St. Mary's, Carlisle, in 1753, at the age of 1 10, is said to have been a member of the cathedral for upwards of 100 years, having first become a member of the establishment as a chorister. It is natural to inquire into the causes which have occasioned the pre valence of longevity in some counties and districts more than in others ; but such inquiries do not appear to produce any satisfactory result. It is generally supposed that the climate of the northern counties is favourable to longevity, but, as we have already observed, the district most remarkable for longevity in Cornwall is the southern coast. In Cumberland it seems to be confined to no particular district : the parishes which border on the Fells on the east side of the county, are rather more remarkable for longevity than those on the western coast ; but there is little difference except in the large towns. We could obtain no conclusion with respect to the diet and habits of the long-lived inhabitants of this county ; as far as we had an op portunity of making the inquiry, some were abstemious, some intemperate. John Taylor, whose employment was frequently by night in the mines, ate heartily at any hour of the day or night, and drank freely : the most re markable circumstance of his habits was the little sleep he took, which was so little, that his life was half as long again as that of any other person of the same age. 6 Division"], [73, "CUMBERLAND. LIII Division of the County into Baronies. After William the Conqueror had given the county of Cumberland to Ranulph de Meschines, who had married his niece, and whom he made Earl of Carlisle, or, as some say, of Cumberland, this Earl divided the county into eleven baronies \u2022, Copeland, Allerdale below Derwent, Wigton, Burgh, Dalston, Greystock, Gilsland, Crosby, Liddell, and a nameless barony in the south-east part of the county, under the fells, given to Adam Fitz- Swein. He reserved in his own hands the forest of Inglewood, which afterwards became part of the Crown demesne. A part of this was some time, by royal grant, vested in the Kings of Scotland, afterwards resumed by the Crown, and granted to the Nevils. The whole was granted by King William III. to the Portland family, and is now vested in the Duke of Devonshire. The barony of Copeland was given by Ranulph to William de Meschines, some say his brother, others a younger son, who built the castle of Egre mont, and gave that name to the barony, which comprised the whole ward of Allerdale above Derwent except the honour of Cockermouth. William de Meschines left an only daughter ; and this barony passed by successive female heirs to Fitz-Duncan, Lucy, and Multon, who took the name of Lucy. The division between coheiresses in this family will be more particularly spoken of hereafter. The whole became eventually vested, by gift and purchase, in the Percy family, whose ancestor married Maud\", heiress of Anthony Lord Lucy, in the fourteenth century, and is now vested in the Earl of Egremont, by descent from Charles Duke of Somerset, who married the heiress of the noble family of Percy. The honour of Cockermouth, with the lordship of the five towns, Brigham, Dean, Eaglesfield, Braithwaite, and Greysouthern, was given by William de Meschines to Waldeof or Waldieve, son of Gospatric Earl of Dunbar ; and except a temporary possession by the Whartons b, has passed in the same manner as the barony of Egremont, and is now the property of the Earl of Egremont. The great barony of Allerdale, given also by William de Meschines to Waldieve, has passed in the manner already described under the barony of Egremont, and is now the property of the Earl of Egremont. a This Maud gave the whole of her inheritance to her second husband, the Earl of Northumber land, and his heirs. b See the account of Cockermouth and the other townships. The"], [74, "CUMBERLAND. LIV The barony of Wigton0 was given by William de Meschines to Waldeof, and by the latter to Odard de Logis, whose posterity took the name of Wiaton, and became extinct in the male line about the middle of the four teenth century, after which the barony of Wigton passed to the family of Lucy, and has descended with Allerdale to the Earl of Egremont. The barony of Burgh d was given by Earl Ranulph to Robert D'Estrivers, from whose family it passed by successive heirs female to the families of Morvill, Multon, Dacre, and Howard. In 1684 it was purchased of Henry Duke of Norfolk by the ancestor of the Earl of Lonsdale, who is the present proprietor. The barony of Gilsland5 was given by Earl Ranulph to his relation Hubert de Vallibus or Vaux. From his family it passed, by successive heirs female to the Multons, Dacres, and Howards, and is now the property of Charles Earl of Carlisle. Naworth Castle has long been the chief seat of this barony; it is supposed to have been at an eariier period at Irthington. The barony of Dalston was given by Earl Ranulph to a younger brother of the Vaux family ; but having escheated to the Crown, it was granted by King Henry III. to the Bishops of Carlisle. It comprises only the parish of Dalston : the north part of the barony, which is in the parish of St. Mary Carlisle, was assigned to the Prior, and now forms the manor of John de Capella, belonging to the Dean and Chapter. The barony of Crosby, given by Earl Ranulph to Waldeof, was by the latter conveyed to the second Bishop of Carlisle and his successors, and is still annexed to the see. It comprises the parish of Crosby, and part of Stanwix. The barony of Liddell, comprising the parishes of Arthuret and Kirk- Andrews, was given by Earl Ranulph to Turgis de Brundas or Brundey : it was afterwards in the Estotevilles, and passed by marriage to the Wakes. The heiress of Lord Wake having married Plantagenet Earl of Kent, it came eventually to the Crown. Having been granted to George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, it was purchased of him in the reign of James I. by the ancestor of Sir James Graham, Bart, the present proprietor. c It comprised the manors of Wigton, Waverton, Blencogo, Dundraw, Oulton, Kirkbride, and their dependencies. d This barony comprises the parishes of Burgh, Bowness, Aikton, Thursby, Orton, Kirk- Bampton, Beaumont, Kirk- Andrews on Eden, and Grinsdale. c This barony extends over the greater part of Eskdale ward, and the parish of Ainstable in Leath ward. The"], [75, "CUMBERLAND. LV The barony of Kirklevington, or Kirklinton, which comprised the parishes of Kirklinton and Scalesby, was given by Earl Ranulph to the Boyvills, amongst whose coheirs it was divided at an early period. The barony of Greystock, comprising the parishes of Greystock and Dacre, was given by Earl Ranulph to Lyolf, whose descendants took the name of Greystock ; from them it passed by female descent to the Dacres and How ards, and is now the property of his Grace the Duke of Norfolk. The barony given by Earl Ranulph to Adam Fitz-Swein, and called after his name, comprised the parishes of Kirkland, Melmerby, &c. This barony was at an early period divided into severalties. Kirk-Oswald was also formerly a barony, though not enumerated among those distributed by Earl Ranulph. It comprised the parishes of Kirk- Oswald and Croglin. This barony belonged to the Engaynes, and passed by female descent to the Morvilles and Dacres. The proprietors of the several baronies, particularly those of the larger ones, granted numerous manors to their dependents, most of which having passed through various hands, continue to be held under such of the baronies as still exist.

On a partition of the property the Earl of Arundel became possessed of Greystock, which barony f has ever since been one of the titles of his noble descendants. Henry Frederic, Earl of Arundel, who died in 1652, father of Thomas, Earl of Arundel, who was restored to the title of Duke of Norfolk, settled the Greystock estate on his fourth son, the Honourable Charles Howard. Upon the death of Edward, Duke of Norfolk, without issue, in 1777, Charles Howard, Esq. of Greystock, grandson of the above-mentioned Charles, succeeded to the dukedom, and was father of Charles, the present duke, who occasionally resides at the ancient castellated mansion of Greystock.

There were mansions on both these estates; Wythorp-hall was certainly for a considerable time one of the seats of the Lowther family. From the time above-mentioned the Lowthers frequently appear in the lists of sheriffs and knights of the shire. In the list of gentiy of the county returned by the commissioners in the 1 2th year of Henry VI. we find four branches of this ancient family described as resident in Cum berland ; Sir Hugh Lowther, who was at the field of Agincourt with King Henry V. ; William Lowther h, of Crookdake ; John Lowther, of Allerby (in Aspatria) ; and William Lowther, of Rose. These probably are all long ago extinct, except that of Sir Hugh, who was then the head of the family. Sir Christopher, the second son of his immediate descendant Sir John Lowther, of Lowther, who died in 1637, settled at Whitehaven, and was created a baronet in 1641.

Graham of Esk and Netherby, 1628 and 1782. \u2014 The Grahams of the borders are supposed to have been descended from John, second son of the first Earl of Monteith. Richard second son of Fergus Graham of Plump, in the parish of Kirk- Andrews on Esk, was created a baronet in 1628, being de scribed as Graham of Eske. The second son of Sir Richard Graham having settled at Norton-Conyers, in Yorkshire, was created a baronet in 1662, and was ancestor of Sir Bellingham Graham, Bart. Sir George, the second baronet of Esk, resided at Netherby, the present family seat : his son, Sir Richard, was in 1680, created Viscount Preston of the kingdom of Scotland ; after the revolution, being apprehended in a boat on the river Thames, as he was about to leave the kingdom for the purpose of joining the abdicated monarch, he was tried and found guilty of high treason, but after a time received a pardon. Upon the death of Charles, the third viscount without issue in 1739, the title of baronet devolved to Charles, elder son of Dr. William Graham, some time Dean of Carlisle, fourth son of Sir George, the second baronet ; but it was not, we believe, for some years claimed, nor is any account of this family inserted in the baronetages of 1741 or 1773. The title has been claimed, and is now enjoyed by Sir Robert Graham, the immediate descendant of the above-mentioned Charles, who is engaged in a mercantile concern, and resides in London. In the year 1782 James Graham, Esq. whose father, Dr. Robert Graham, second son of the Dean of Carlisle, had inherited the Netherby estate under the will of Lady Widdrington, surviving sister and sole heiress of the last Lord Preston, was created a baronet, and is the present possessor of Netherby.

Sir Henry Fletcher, who was created a baronet in 1782, was descended from Philip, third son of Thomas Fletcher of Cockermouth, (grandfather of the first baronet,) who married the heiress of Musgrave of Clea-Hall, about the beginning of the seventeenth century.

The title became extinct in 1765, by the death of Sir George Dalston, the fourth baronet, who resided in Yorkshire ; Sir George left an only daughter, married to a French gentleman of the name of Dillon. The title was assumed some time after Sir George's death by Captain John Dalston, who probably was led to believe that he had a claim to it as heir male of the Acorn-bank branch of the family, which became extinct by the death of Sir Wilham Dalston, Knight, about the year 1770, but it could not be well founded, because the Acorn-bank family branched offlong before the Dalstons became baronets, being descended from a younger son of Thomas Dalston, Esq. who lived in the reign of Henry VIII. by a second marriage with a coheiress of Carlisle. Captain Dalston left no male issue, and the family is supposed to be now entirely extinct. The coheiresses of Kirkbride, Warcop, and Thomworth, married into the family of Dalston, of Dalston.

There were formerly deer-parks at Cockermouth, Naworth, Brampton, Isel, Brayton, Castlerigg, Ulpha % Millom, &c. and a paddock at Crookdake. The Duke of Norfolk has extensive deer parks at Greystock and Gow barrow*. There are deer parks also at Muncaster and Crofton, and a paddock at Nether-hall. Geographical and Geological Description of the County. Boundaries, Extent, <\u00a7r. \u2014 The county of Cumberland is situated on the western coast and on the borders of Scotland ; being bounded on the west by the Irish sea, on the north by Scotland, on the east by Northumberland and Durham, and on the south by Westmorland and Lancashire. Its extreme length from north-east to south-west, is about 72 miles, its extreme bres-Ith (from the junction of Crook- Burn with the Tees to the borders of Scotland, at the end of the Scots- Dyke, in the parish of Kirk- Andrews) about 38 miles. The circumference is calculated at 224 miles, containing 1516 square miles, or 970,240 acres. Reckoning the total quantity of acres at 970,000, the editors of the Agri cultural Survey, written in 1793, calculate that there were 470,000 acres of old inclosures, 150,000 of improvable common, that 8000 were occupied by lakes and waters, and that the remainder, 342,000 acres, were unim provable wastes in the mountainous districts. Since this period nearly 200,000 acres, comprising a much greater quantity than had been reckoned of improvable common, have been inclosed under several acts of parliament, and more than half that quantity within the last ten years. Soils and Strata. \u2014 The principal soils of this county are a rich strong loam, extending over a small portion of it ; dry loams, including the various degrees from the rich light brown loam to the light sandy soils, which occupies a larger portion of the county than any other, not only the lower districts but the sides of some of the mountains ; and wet loams and black * Chron.

The first of these consists of alternate beds of lime-stone, sand-stone, slate, clay, and coal, dipping gently towards the east, in which direction the mountains also decline, being very precipitous towards the west. They abound in veins of lead, &c. The junction of these strata with the red sand-stone beneath, may be traced from near Kirkland, in a line nearly parallel to the river Eden, a little to the east of Brampton, by Stapleton to Kirkshope, on the borders of Scotland. The coal, which occurs in considerable quantity on the high ground just described, is in general of inferior quality ; but some beds at Talkin-Fell, Tindal-Fell, and Cold, or more properly Coal-Fell, are tolerably good. The city of Carlisle, and indeed all the places on the eastern side of the county, derive their supply of fuel from these pits. The second division, including the south-west part of the county, is bounded by a curve line beginning at the foot of Ulswater, and continued to Penruddock, Hesket-Newmarket, Uldale, Cockermouth, Ennerdale, Wastdale, Eskdale, and Black-Comb. It consists of rocks belonging to the primitive and transition classes ; granite, syenite, green-stone, green stone-slate, clay-slate, compact feld-spar, and porphyry, are abundant. On the north of Saddleback is a small quantity of gneiss and mica-slate. Primitive limestone has not been discovered. Hornblend-rock is of rare occurrence, and it is doubtful whether the rock, which, constitutes the summit of Skiddaw and Saddleback, can maintain the denomination which has sometimes been given to it of hornblend-slate. A thin bed of transition lime-stone occurs at the south-west extremity of the county, and is covered by slate. Some lead and copper mines are wrought in this division, but not to any great extent. The graphite or plumbago of Borrowdale, is well known all over Europe. b Agricultural Survey of Cumberland, 1805. c For the greater part of our information respecting the strata and mineralogy of Cumberland, we are indebted to E.L. Irton, Esq., and \u2014 \u2014 Fryer, Esq. The"], [122, "CUMBERLAND. 102 The remaining division is occupied partly by red sand-stone, partly by a series of beds of lime-stone, sand-stone, coal, &c. analogous to those on the Cross-Fell range. The red sand-stone occupies a considerable extent of country, appearing along the foot of the range just mentioned, and extending to about a mile west of Penrith, from whence its western boundary may be traced near the following places, Blencowe, Skelton, across the Caldew river, a little below Sebergham, to Westward, Allhallows, Aspatria, and to the sea near Allonby. In the marl associated with this sand-stone, gypsum is worked at Newbiggin, Coat-Hill, and St. Bees-Head, near Whitehaven. The red sand-stone is known in some places to exceed sixty fathoms in thickness. No coal has been discovered in it, nor any metallic veins. It is extremely probable that the tract of red sand-stone in this valley, comprehends two distinct series of beds, bearing a close resemblance to each other in mineralogical character, but deposited at very different periods, the one lying beneath the rocks which form the escarpment on the east of the county, the other lying upon the coal measures at Whitehaven. c Between the mountainous district of the lakes and the valley of Carlisle, occurs a belt of compact lime-stone, slate-clay, sand-stone, and coal, which rise on every side towards the primitive country. Magnesian lime-stone intervenes between the coal and red sand-stone at Whitehaven and the lime-stone on Broadfield, belongs in all probability to the same formation. The .mountain called Great-Barrock has a cap of basalt, and there is a hummock called Caer-mote near Bothel, composed of amygdaloid and clay porphyry, resting upon coal measures. Surface and Scenery. \u2014 The surface of Cumberland is much diversified ; the northern and north-western parts, bordering on the Irish sea, the Sol way-Frith, and Scotland, are generally level, and do not afford any interest ing scenery, except in the course of the several rivers ; of the Caldew, near Sebergham, Dalston, and Rose Castle\", and of the Eden, the banks of which are in several places well wooded and very beautiful, especially about Corby Castle. The walks at Nunnery, upon the banks of the little river Croglin, which falls into the Eden, exhibit much romantic and beautiful scenery, c A particular account of the disposition and thickness of the several strata in some of the coal pits near Whitehaven ; the distance of the beds from each other ; and their depth below the surface ; is given in the form of tables by- Dr. Dixon, in his account of these coal mines, added to his literary life of Dr. Brownrigg, 1801, octavo, p. 113 124. d The Irthing, in the neighbourhood of Lanercost, the Eske, on the borders of Scotland. produced."], [123, "CUMBERLAND. 103 produced by a mountain stream, broken by frequent cascades, and accom panied with a great variety of rock and wood. The eastern and south-western parts of the county are chiefly occupied by mountains, many of which are of considerable height ; between these and the level part above noticed, are lower ranges of smooth hills, most of which are distinguished by the appellation of fells. The mountainous dis trict which forms the eastern boundary, is a long continued range of moun tains and high ground, called by the names of Cross-fell, Hartside-fell, Geltsdale forest, and Spadeadam waste ; none of these present by any means a picturesque appearance, their summits being for the most part very little broken. The numerous mountains in the south-west part of the county, present a great variety of grand and picturesque forms; and are accompanied by lakes of considerable extent, and higlily cultivated vallies, in many parts well wooded ; forming altogether some of the most remarkable and beautiful scenery in the kingdom. The principal mountains are known by the names of Black-Comb, Skiddaw, Saddleback, Bow-fell, Grasmere-fell, Helvellyn, Hardknott, Wry-nose, High- Pike, Pillar, Sea-fell, and the Screes d : several of these are very precipitous and rugged. The largest of the lakes is Ulswater, which for the space of about six miles forms the boundary between the counties of Cumberland and West morland : the whole lake is somewhat more than eight miles in length, and being in no part quite a mile wide, has much the appearance of a river. The scenery of this lake is remarkably beautiful and picturesque ; its most prominent feature is the mountain Helvellyn, which with some other subor dinate ones, seen over Patterdale with summits sharp and pointed, have d The following are the heights of the principal mountains and hills of Cumberland, taken from \" The altitudes of the stations and other hills, computed from the observations made in the course of the trigonometrical survey,\" 1811, quarto.

CIV been said to resemble the Alpine forms more than any others in this country: the beauty of this scene is considerably encreased by an adequate portion of oak wood in Gobarrow park, and other parts bordering on the lake. The mountain Helvellyn is also the most conspicuous among those rugged and barren objects which are seen from the lake of Thirlemeer or Leathes water, which is long and narrow like Ulswater, but of smaller dimensions, situated at the entrance into the small but beautiful vale of St. John's. One of the finest scenes in Cumberland is that of the vale of Keswick, containing the lakes of Derwentwater, and Bassenthwaite or Broad-water, communicating with each other by a small stream. The boundaries of Derwentwater, consisting of fine woods of oak and rich inclosures, over which are seen the mountain of Skiddaw at the northern extremity, and Borrowdale at the southern, with what Gray has termed \" its turbulent chaos of mountain behind mountain,\" present a great variety of magnificent and beautiful scenes ; a considerable addition to these, in rainy seasons, is Lowdore waterfall, the height of which is said to be not less than 200 feet. Borrowdale, a narrow valley, bounded on either side by steep rocky mountains, affords a variety of picturesque scenes. The objects which have attracted most notice, are, the village of Grange, situated on rising ground near the entrance of the valley ; the hill called Castle-Cragg, of a conical form, covered with wood, and having on its summit traces of a military work ; and the Bowder-stone, thirty-one yards in length and eight in height*. lying detached upon a rock. The lake of Buttermere lies to the north-west, at no great distance from Borrowdale, surrounded by rugged mountains, the most remarkable of which are, Honister-Cragg, High-Style, and Red-Pike : and a little further northward lie Crummock-water and Lows-water, connected with each other and with Buttermere by a small stream. At the western extremity of this group of mountains are those distin guished by the names of Hardknot, Wry-nose, Sea-fell, and the Screes ; the three first form the eastern boundary of Eskdale, which, viewed from the richly wooded hills about Muncaster Castle, at the opposite extremity, exhibits one of the finest views in Cumberland, The precipitous side of the Screes forms the southern boundary of Wastwater, and by descending quite into the lake, gives it a different character from any of the others ; jthe scenery in the neighbourhood of Wastdale is extremely picturesque.

CV Rivers. \u2014 The two principal rivers of this county are the Eden and the Derwent. The Eden, which rises in Westmorland, after having been a boundary between the two counties for about two miles, skirting the parish of Kirkland, enters Cumberland about a mile south of Edenhall, passes by Edenhall, Langwathby, and Great-Salkeld, to Kirk-Oswald ; thence near Nunnery and Armathwaite Castle, between Corby Castle and Wetherall to Warwick-bridge ; thence near Crosby and Stanwix to Carlisle ; and from thence near Grinsdale, Kirk-Andrews, Beaumont, and Rowcliffe. Not far from the latter place it falls into the sea ; its course in Cumberland being about 35 miles. The Derwent rises in Borrowdale, about five miles south-west of Derwentwater, which it feeds; after merging from the lake, it passes between Crosthwaite and Portingscales to Bassenthwaite-water, of which also it is the feeder ; issuing thence it passes by Armathwaite-hall, under Euse-bridge, by Isel to Cockermouth, where it is joined by the Cocker ; thence passing near Papcastle, Brigham, Ribton-hall, Camerton, and Work ington, it falls into the sea near the last-mentioned place ; its course from Derwentwater being about 20 miles. The other principal rivers are here arranged in alphabetical order. The Bleng rises near Ponsonby fell, passes near Gosfbrth, and falls into the lit between Nether- Wasdale and Santon, about six miles from its rise. The Colder rises not far from Ennerdale water, passes by Calder Abbey between Ponsonby and Sella-park, and falls into the sea at Calder-foot, its course being about eight miles. The Caldew, called near its source Cald-beck and Caldew-beck, rises on Caldbeck fell, passes near Sebergham and Rose Castle to Dalston, and falls into the Eden at Carlisle ; its course from Caldbeck to Carlisle being about thirteen miles. The Cocker rises out of Buttermere water (which is fed by some small streams rising among the hills to the south ;) it passes through Crumock water, to the north of which a pretty large stream connects with Loweswater. The Cocker passes northward, a little more to the east, and leaving Lorton on the right, passes to Cockermouth, where it joins the Derwent ; its course from Crumockwater to Cockermouth being about six miles. The Croglin rises on Thackthorn fell, passes Croglin, contributes to the beautiful scenery at Nunnery, where it forms several small cascades, and falls ifito the Eden near that place.

The Eamont, issuing out of Ulsewater, runs to the south of Penrith, and joins the Lowther about a mile to the west, after a course of about five miles, during which it divides the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland. The Ellen or Elne rises upon Caldfell, and passing by Uldale, Ireby, Bolton, Torpenhow, Whitehall, Harby-brow, Blennerhasset, Aspatria, Hayton Castle, Outerby, Allerby, Dearham, Ellenborough, and Netherhall, falls into the sea at Maryport. The Enn issues out of Ennerdale-water, which is fed by a small stream, called in the maps Liza, rising about four miles to the south. From Ennerdale-water it passes by Ennerdale chapel, Cleator, Egremont, and St. Bride, and falls into the sea at Enn-foot, after a course of about eleven miles from the lake. The Esk which gives name to Eskdale ward, rises in the Cheviot-hills. At Canonby it becomes for a short distance the boundary between England and Scotland ; entering Cumberland it passes by Kirk- Andrews, Netherby, by the edge of Solway moss, and after being joined by the Leven, falls into the sea near Rockliffe marsh ; its course through Cumberland being about six miles. The Esk in the ward of .Allerdale above Derwent, is fonned by some small streams which rise near Bow-fell ; it runs through a valley which takes the name of Eskdale, and passing by Muncaster and Waberthwaite, falls into the sea at Ravenglas ; its course being about thirteen miles. The Gelt rises in Croglin fell, and passing near Castle-Carrock, falls into the Irthing near Bridgwood foot ; its course being about ten miles. The Greeta issues out of Thirlmeer, near Threlkeld, and passing near Keswick, joins the Derwent soon after it emerges from the lake, about seven miles from Thirlmeer. The Irt, issuing from Wast-water (which is supplied by several small streams from above Wastdale-head) passes by Nether- Wasdale, Santon, Irton, between Drigg and Carlton, and falls into the sea near Ravenglas, its course being about eight miles. The Irthing rises on the borders of Northumberland, and for about sixteen miles forms the boundary of the counties ; about a mile after passing Gilsland Spa, it enters Cumberland, and running by the two Dentons, Naworth Castle, Lanercost, Brampton Old Church, Irthington, and Newby, falls into the Eden ; its course after it enters Cumberland being about thirteen miles. The"], [131, "CUMBERLAND. CVII The Kershope, a small river, is for a course of about six miles from Dove Craggs to its junction with the Liddell, the boundary between Cumberland and Scotland. The Kingwater, rising near Side Common, falls into the Irthing at Kell woodf; its course being about ten miles. The Leven or Line is formed of the junction of two rivers, called the Black Line and the White Line. The Black Line, which rises near Dove Craggs, runs by Trough ; the White Line, rising near Christenbury Craggs, runs by Nixon and Line-holme ; after the junction the Line passes near Shank-Castle, Brackenhill, Kirk-linton, and West-linton, and falls into the Esk, not far from its embouchure. The two streams join at about ten miles distance from their respective rise : the course of the Line after the junction is about twelve miles. The Liddell is for about eight miles the boundary between Cumberland and Scotland, from its junction with the Kershope to its junction with the Esk. The Lowther divides Cumberland and Westmorland from near Brougham Castle till it falls into the Eden, about a mile south of Edenhall.

The Nent rises in the south-east extremity of the parish of Alston, and falls into the town near the town of Alston ; its course being about six miles. The Petterell, which rises in the parish of Greystock, not far from Plump ton, runs by Ellerton, Petterell Crooks, Wreay, Newbiggin, and Upperby, and falls into the Eden near Rickerby ; its course being about twenty miles. The Sark is the boundary between Cumberland and Scotland for about five miles, near Solway moss.

Lakes and Tarns. \u2014 The principal lakes of Cumberland are DerweiU water, Bassenthwaite, Buttermere, Crumock, LoMreswater, Ennerdale, Wast-water, Thirlmeer, and Devock-lake : Ulswater is partly in Cumber land and partly in Westmorland. The beautiful scenery of some of these lakes is elsewhere briefly spoken of. The chief of the smaller lakes or tarns as they are called, are Burn moor tarn at the head of the Mite, two name less tarns near Sella-field and Bray (in St. Bride's and St. John's parishes) ; the Stank near Abbey-Holme ; Martin tarn in Aikton ; Over-water not far from Uldale ; the lough near Anthorn, in Bowness ; a small lough near Rowcliffe ; Tarn-Wadling in Hesket ; Talkin tarn, in the parish of Hayton ; and Tindale tarn, near the borders of Northumberland. Besides the more common river fish, such as pike, trout, eels, &c. salmon are abundant in the Eden, Esk, and Derwent ; sea-trout, branlin, or samlet, &c. There are lampreys and graylings, shad, and occasionally sturgeon in the Eden and Esk. The lakes abound in trout, and the gwiniad or schelly ; pike and other common river fish ; there are charr in Ulswater, Crummock water, Buttermere, and Ennerdale water : Tarn-Wadlin abounds with carp.

CXI Calcareous spar, brown spar, pearl spar, satin spar \", fluor spar, carbonate of barytes, and sulphate of barytes, accompany the lead ore in most of the mines in Alston moor. Selenite, in long transparent crystals, is found in the Alston moor mines, and in the gypsum at St. Bees-Head. Of Metallic Fossils the following occur \u2014 native copper, copper pyrites, grey copper ore, green ore, blue ore, and malachite, from the Newlands and Caldbeck mines. Galena, carbonate of lead, phosphate of lead and antimonial lead ore ; the two first are common in all the mines, the others at Caldbeck. A mine of antimony was formerly worked at Bassenthwaite ; the ore is the sulphuret of antimony. Blende generally accompanies the lead ores, and calamine is found in some of the veins in Alston-moor. H\u00e6matite iron ore occurs in great quantity near Whitehaven ; iron mines in Eskdale ; and iron pyrites are very common in the coal in veins, and imbedded in the slates. Arsenic pyrites are found in Newlands mines, and native arsenic occurs in small quantity in the refuse workings of an old lead mine on Saddleback. The oxides of titanium and iron (the titan eisan of the Germans) is found in some of the syenite of Caldbeck fells, and Wolfram in the same place. Grey cobalt has lately been met with, but in very small quantity, on the north side of Saddleback. Several hollow tubes, of a vitreous substance, have been lately found in the hillocks of drifted sand, between the mouth of the river Irt and the sea ; near to Drigg, rising above the surface perpendicularly through the sand, and tapering downwards from about an inch and a half to half an inch in diameter. One of them was found to descend about 30 feet. These are supposed to have been produced by means of lightning. p Extraneous fossils are found imbedded in the limestone strata in several parts of Cumberland. Woodward mentions coralines of various kinds found near Lanercost priory and Torpenhow ; anomi\u00e6; entrochi ; asteri\u0153, the bone of some animal of a bright green colour, found in a copper mine ; parts of the striated stem of a plant in pit-stone near Whitehaven, and vertebrae of fish found on the shore near Muncaster. q Indigenous Plants. \u2014 The county of Cumberland, particularly the moun tainous part of it, produces a great variety of plants, which are of rare occurrence in other parts of the kingdom ; a list of them is given in the following table.

Mineral Waters. \u2014 There is no mineral water in this county of any note except the sulphureted spring at Gilsland, which has been long cele brated, chiefly for the cure of cutaneous disorders. This spring, which is situated in a picturesque valley on the western bank of the Irthing, has been resorted to on account of its medical qualities upwards of seventy years. There are three boarding houses for the accommodation of the com pany ; one of which is at a place called Wardrew on the opposite side of the Irthing, and in the county of Noe'thumberland.

There is a pretty strong sulphur spring in the township of Biglands, in the parish of Aikton, (discovered about the year 1775,) which is frequented by a few of the neighbouring country people ; in the winter it is much weakened by inundation of fresh water. p At Stanger, two miles north of Lorton, is a saline spring nearly resem bling the Cheltenham water. It turns white with the spirit of hartshorn, and lets fall a great sediment, with oil of tartar : a gallon of it will yield 1 170 grains of sediment, whereof 1080 are sea-salt. q In the parish of Melmerby is a sulphureous spring, occasionally resorted to by the country people, and in the same parish a chalybeate spring on the fells. In Hutchinson's History, chiefly among Housman's notes, there is mention of chalybeate springs at Bewcastle, Great-Salkeld, (on the com mon) ; Iron-gill, in the parish of Sebergham ; and three at Brampton : saline springs also at Gilcrux and Drig, and two in the parish of Crosthwaite, near the head of the Derwent, much resorted to by the country people ; a sulphur spring at Bewcastle, and a medicinal spring, of which the nature is not described, near Kirkland, in the parish of Wigton.

This county, till of late years, did not produce much more corn than was sufficient for the consumption of its inhabitants p. Since the inclosures, which have taken place to a great extent within the last twenty years q, considerable quantities of flour and oatmeal have been exported coast ways to Liverpool and other parts of Lancashire, and the Bristol Channel. The chief exports are from Whitehaven, the computed annual quantity now sent from that port being between 2000 and 2500 tons. Both flour and oatmeal are exported also in smaller quantities from Maryport and Raven glass. The north-west part of the county is the principal corn district, and where wheat is chiefly grown ; Gilsland also, in the north-east, is a corn dis trict, where the turnip and barley system is very prevalent. Potatoes are cultivated in considerable abundance for the Cumberland markets. The north-east, south-east, and southern parts of the county are chiefly appro priated to grazing ; and a considerable quantity of butter is sent in firkins to distant markets. Among the productions of this county for the use of the table may be mentioned cranberries, which grow in great profusion on the moors, and are sold in the season at Longtown and other markets, and sent in barrels to London and elsewhere. The sale at Longtown is so extensive that they may be deemed an important article of commerce. Near Tarn-Wad ling are some cranberry bogs which have been fenced in by the inclosure of Inglewood forest, containing about ten acres in the whole. The fruit from these inclosures being suffered to attain a degree of ripeness which the cran berries on the common moors, from the eagerness of the gatherers to bring them to market, seldom arrive at, is much esteemed, and the farmers who occupy them, consider them as of more value per acre than any other part of their estates. The cranberries are sold at es. 6d. per quart. The fisheries of this county are of some importance. There are herring fisheries at Allonby, Maryport, and Whitehaven. The fishing season at the two former begins in September; the seasons of 18 13 and 1814, were very p An exportation of oats and big had just commenced in 1688, (T. Denton's MS.) probably iu no great quantity. 1 See p. c. productive."], [142, "CUMBERLAND. CXVIII productive. The Whitehaven fishery is on an extensive scale, the season at this place begins in May. The fish market at Whitehaven is abundantly supplied, and with great variety. Great quantities of cod fish are taken on the coast of Cumberland, principally used for home consumption. In the parish of Bootle they cure cod for the Liverpool market. There are valuable salmon fisheries in the Eske, Eden, and Derwent. Salmon is sent from Carlisle and Bowness to London ; the fishing season at Carlisle begins in November ; at Bowness in the spring. The Workington fishing is also in the spring ; the salmon from this fishery is consumed in the neigh bourhood. Mr. T. Denton describes the Workington fishery as worth 300I. per annum in 1688. Char from the lakes is potted at Keswick and sent to London. The pearls still occasionally found in the muscles of the Irt, were formerly thought to be of some importance as an article of commerce, and a patent is said to have been obtained for the fishery in the reign of George I. but it proved one of the bubbles of that period. The most valuable subterranean productions of this county, indeed almost the only commodities which are considered as of much importance in a commercial view, are lead and coals ; although in former times copper was dug and exported in great quantities, and the silver mines were esteemed of considerable value. The latter appear to have been worked only at the expence of the crown, when there was a mint at Carlisle in the reign of Henry III. and probably would never have yielded any profit to a private adventurer. Fuller speaking of the copper mines at Newlands, says, \" they lay long neglected (choaked in their own rubbish), till renewed about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth, when plenty of copper was here afforded, both for home use and foreign transportation. But copper itself was too soft for several military services, and could not alone (no single person can prove a parent), produce brass most useful for that purpose. Here taste and see, divine providence, which never doth its work by halves, and generally doubleth gifts by seasonably sending them ; lapis calaminaris was then first found in England, the mother of brass as copper the father thereof. Hence came it to pass, that Queen Elizabeth left more brass than she found iron ord nance in the kingdom. And our wooden walls, (so our ships are com monly called), were roughcasted over with a coat of firmer constitution. We must not forget the names of the two Dutchmen, good frogs by sea but better moles by land, who resound out these copper mines, wherein also some silver (no new milk without some cream therein), viz. Thomas Shur- 10 land"], [143, "CUMBERLAND CXIX land and Daniel Hotchstabter s of Auspurge, in Germany, whose nephews turning purchasers of lands hereabouts, prefer easily to take what the earth tenders in her hands above ground, than painfully to pierce into her heart for greater treasure.\" \" I am sorry to hear and lothe to believe, what some credible persons have told me, that within this twenty years the copper in this county hath been wholly discontinued, and that not for want of metal but mining for it. Sad, that the industry of our age could not keep what the ingenuity of the former found out. And I would willingly put it on another account, that the burying of so much steel in the bowels of men during our civil wars, hath hindered their digging of copper out of the entrails of the earth, hoping that these peaceable times will encourage to the resuming thereof.\" The apology which Fuller wished for, it appears, did in fact exist, for Mr. T. Denton, in his MS. History of Cumberland (1688), observes, that the smelting houses were all destroyed, and the miners most of them slain in the civil wars. \" The works,\" says he, \" have never since been set on foot, albeit there be still great store of copper and lead in these mines. The charge of footing those works and forges again would be 4000I.\" The smelting houses for the copper were at Bure-side, on the east of Keswick. Mr. Robinson, in his Natural History of Cumberland, printed in 1709, says, that on his survey of the mountains of Newlands, he found eleven veins, which had been opened and wrought by the Germans ; the richest of which was called Gowd-scalp or Gold-scalp : the ore of this mine (being the same probably from which silver was obtained in the reign of Henry III.), was found so rich in silver that it was claimed for the Queen (Elizabeth), and recovered by a trial at law from the Earl of Northumber land, and the Queen's agent took possession of 100 tons of ore which had been dug ', but we have no account of it being then worked as a silver mine ; it is probable that a composition was made with the crown, by the earl and the adventurers. \" This rich vein,\" says Mr. Robinson, \" and several more in the mountains of Newlands, are now laid open and re covered by his Grace the Duke of Somerset ; and likewise smelting houses, furnaces, and all other conveniences are made ready by his grace for setting forward a great work. It may be presumed, that the discouragement his grace met with, which at present hath put a stop to so noble a project, s Hechstetter. ' An act of parliament has since been passed (in the reign of William and Mary), by which it is determined, that copper mines shall not be claimable by the crown, notwithstanding the ore may be impregnated with silver. was"], [144, "CUMBERLAND. CXX was his meeting wTith an ignorant operator, who, understanding not the nature of the ore, burnt and destroyed fifty tons of the best gold-scalp ore, without the production of one pound of fine copper.\" About the year 1756, the old works at Gold-scalp were opened\" at a great expence by Mr. Gilpin, but the undertaking proved unsuccessful ; about the year 1806 a copper mine was opened about half a mile from Gold scalp, by Mr. Sheffield, who holds a lease under the Earl of Egremont. For about three years this mine produced about 150 tons of good ore an. nually, but the quantity has since very much diminished, and there is at present no prospect of better success. Copper mines have been worked at Borrowdale, near Ulpha, on Cald beck-fell, and at Buttermere. Camden speaks of Alston-moor as having been formerly famous for copper mines. Lapis calaminaris is found in some parts of the county, and mines were worked for it about a century ago. The principal lead-mines in Cumberland are those at Alston-moor, said to have been discovered and first worked x by Sir Francis Radcliffe, after wards Earl of Derwentwater : they had become of much importance at the time of his being advanced to that title in 1 688.7 Upon the attainder of the third Earl of Derwentwater, these mines, with the manor and the other Derwentwater estates, became vested in Greenwich Hospital, under an act of parliament. In 1768 there were 119 lead-mines in the parish of Alston, 1 1 5 of which were then held on lease under the Hospital. The average annual produce of that and the two preceding years is stated at 20,943 bings1, the value being about 70,000 1. Housmana states the clear yearly produce to the owners at i6,oool., and the number of persons employed in the mines at e,eoo. They are not worked at present quite to the same extent, or with equal success; the number of mines held under the Hos pital in 1814, was 102; the number of bings produced was 11,496; the price of the lead in 1813, was 4I. 5s. for bowse ore, and 3I. 5s. for the culling or inferior ore. b \u25a0 The oaken beams, mentioned by Mr. Robinson, as having been used in supporting the works, were then found in perfect preservation, with the bark upon them.

CXXI A lead mine had been worked at Ousby with some success in 1709\u00b0. This, or another mine in the same parish, at Bulmanhill, was worked in 1793, but has been discontinued for several years. It appears that a lead mine had been opened at Melmerby in 1709 d, but with no great success. Some lead mines have been working with pretty good success for a few years past, on Crossfell, in the parish of Kirkland. A publication of Mr. Westgarth Forster's, bearing date 1809, speaks of these mines, which had then been discovered only a few years, as having produced in some years nearly 5000 bings of lead, the average price being then 5I. 1 os. per bing. Though spoken of by this writer as one concern, there are two mines on Crossfell, one belonging to the Fleming family, the other to the heirs of Lough Carle ton, Esq., which have employed above 100 workmen in each ; but the latter is supposed to be worked out, unless some new vein should be discovered within its boundaries. A lead-mine has been worked for three or four years past on Caldbeck fell, as it is said, with considerable success ; but we have not been able to ascertain to what extent. There are three lead-mines working at Newlands, but with very little success. The principal collieries on the coast of Cumberland are those at White haven and Workington. It has been supposed that the Whitehaven collieries were first worked for foreign consumption by Sir John Lowther in 1660; but although it is certain that the great improvements in the harbour, and the extension of the coal trade, were caused by the spirited exertions of that baronet, yet it appears by an engraved view of Whitehaven in 1642, which represents a small harbour with vessels, towards which horses are carrying packs from Whingill colliery, that coals were exported in the time of his father Sir Christopher. The Whitehaven collieries, now the property of the Earl of Lonsdale, have been worked ever since with increased spirit and activity, and are at this time by far the most extensive concern of this nature in the kingdom. The principal collieries at Whitehaven are Howgill on the west, and Whingill * on the east side of the town. There is a third at Scalegill, between Whitehaven and St. Bees, first worked in the early part of the last century, when the coals were carried by waggons to the water side ; c Robinson. d Ibid. e These collieries are unconnected, except by a stone drift 400 yards in length, made in 1796, for the purpose of conveying the water from Whingill colliery to Saltom engine in Howgill. \u00ab V/OL. IV. q it"], [146, "CUMBERLAND. CXXII it was afterwards worked only for inland sale. This work broke in ift 1792, but a new pit was sunk about the year 1807, and it is still worked for inland sale. There are three entrances to the Howgill and four to the Whingill colliery, called Bear-mouths, or Day-holes, by which both men and horses descend to the bottom of the pits. The deepest pits are King pit, 120 fathoms, and Thwaite-pit, 150 fathoms, both in the Howgill col liery ; the latter is 112 fathoms below the sea, being the greatest depth which has yet been sunk. The greatest distance to which workings have been as yet made in a direct line from the shore is a thousand yards. The first steam-engine in use at Whitehaven was erected by Sir James Lowther early in the last century at the Ginns, for raising water. The first steam-engine used for raising coals was in 1787 at George-pit, in Whingill colliery; others were erected for the same purpose in 1793, 1794* and 1795. There are now two steam-engines for pumping water, and three for raising coals at each of the principal collieries of Howgill and Whingill ; and there is a steam-engine for raising coals at the Scalegill colliery. The larger pumping engine at the William pit, on the Whingill colliery, is of about eeo horses power; that at Saltom pit, on the Howgill colliery, is of about 80 horses power. The produce of the two great collieries is above 50,000 waggon-loads f ; i.e. above 112,500 tons from each. The coals were formerly carried from the works to the sea side in packs on horseback. Small waggons were first introduced about or soon after the year 1720, by Mr. Carlisle Spedding, Sir James Lowther's agent, who had seen them at the Newcastle works. In 1813, the waggon-ways, which were before of wood, were laid with cast iron, and on the Howgill side a self-acting inclined plane constructed, 290 yards long, with a perpendicular altitude of 1 1 5 feet. Since this alteration, three waggons, coupled together, are conducted by one man and horse, whereas, formerly it was necessary to have a man and horse to each waggon. When brought to the water side, the coals are conveyed to the wooden galleries erected for that pur pose, on a level with the railways, at the end of which galleries the coals are shot from the waggons down large wooden trunks, about 60 feet in length, usually called by the appropriate name of hurries, into the vessels. When no vessels are ready for lading, the coals are deposited in a place called the Staith, from whence, when wanted, they are again loaded on waggons, and shot down the hurries. There have been some rare instances of The waggons carry about two tons and a quarter each. from"], [147, "CUMBERLAND. cxxen from 800 to 900 waggon-loads having been shipped in one day, forming the lading of 13 vessels. When the weather is fine and there are nu merous vessels in the harbour, eight or nine vessels, containing from 500 to 600 waggon-loads are frequently laded ; but the latter is much beyond the usual average. The average amount of annual exports for five years, ending in December 18 14, was about 100,000 waggon-loads, besides a very considerable inland consumption ; very considerable, indeed, for the town of Whitehaven alone. The greatest exportation is in the summer months. The average amount of the annual exports, taken for 20 years preceding 1793, was about 75,000 waggon-loads, the average of 12 years ending with 18 14, about 87,500. About 900 persons are employed in the Whitehaven collieries. At New-town is a cast-iron manufactory for the use of the collieries, with a steam-engine. The next colliery in point of extent on the coast, is that of Workington, belonging to Jo. Christian Curwen, Esq. which exported for the five years ending with 1813, about 28,000 waggon-loads annually; Mr. Curwen's collieries at Harrington exported during the same period about 19,000 waggon-loads annually ; and those of Broughton-moor, from Maryport, about 8000 waggon-loads. At Maryport about 4000 waggon-loads, during the same period, were annually exported from Mr. Senhouse's colliery, and about the same quantity from that of Mr. Walker's colliery at Flimby wood, held under the Earl of Lonsdale. Mr. Curwen has four pits in working at Workington, from 60 to 90 fathoms deep. There are about 400 persons employed in the colliery at Workington. In this colliery there are six steam-engines ; three at Har rington, and two at Broughton-moor. The engine at Isabella pit, at Workington, is of 160 horses power, having a cylinder of 66 inches dia meter ; this is a double powered engine, the steam pressing on the piston both at the top and bottom, which makes it of equal power with a single engine, whose cylinder is 93 f inches diameter. The collieries at Deerham and Arlochden are worked but to a small extent; the Cammerton colliery is worked solely for the Seaton iron-foundery. The Distington collieries are worked only for the lime-works, and for inland sale. The collieries on Lord Lonsdale's estate near Workington have not been worked for about thirty years. The colliery at Moresby, from which coals were formerly exported at Parton, has been disused since the year 1770. The principal inland collieries are those at Bolton pasture, held under the Earl of Egremont by Fawcet, Crosthwaite and Co., supposed to have a q 2 sale"], [148, "CUMBERLAND. CXXIV sale of about 15,000 waggon-loads yearly; Greysouthern, belonging to Messrs. Walker, Harris, and Co., supposed to have a sale of about 10,000 waggon-loads annually ; and Tindall-fell, belonging to Lord Carlisle, which produces the chief supply for Carlisle, Brampton, Penrith, &c. There are collieries also at Little-Broughton, Outerside, Gilcrux, All-hallows, and Huer-hill. The Warnell-fell colliery has been worked out. There are some coal-pits at Croglin, and other places on the side of the Fells, worked chiefly for the purpose of burning lime. At Crowgarth, in the parish of Cleator, is an iron mine of a very superior kidney ore. It was not much worked till the year 1784. About the year 1790, and a few years afterwards, 20,000 tons of ore were annually exported from Whitehaven to Hull, and to the Carron-works. This mine has not been worked for several years, except for a few tons used in the colour manufactory at the Ginns. There is an iron-mine also at Bigrigg, in the parish of Egremont, not worked for many years, from which considerable quantities were exported to Hull, &c. The iron-works at Seaton, and else where in Cumberland, are supplied with pig-iron from Wales. Some years ago considerable quantities of a ferruginous sort of limestone were exported from the parish of Arlochden to the iron-works at Carron ; but this concern has been discontinued. A black stone called Catscalp, raised at Brathwaite, in the parish of Dean, was used in considerable quantities in the iron-works at Seaton, but since the company of that place have discon tinued making pig-iron, (which was about the year 1813), the demand for it has ceased. At Harrington they collect ironstone upon the sea-shore, and export a few hundred tons annually to Ulverston ; about three hundred tons were exported in 18 14. At the head of Borrowdale, on the side of a very steep mountain, is the celebrated mine of wadd, or black lead. The demand for this article being limited, the mine is only opened occasionally, so as to answer that demand. As this is a substance which does not require any mechanical process to prepare it for use, great care is taken to secure it from plunder. The mine is only accessible through the agent's house, which is built over it. In consequence of the ease with which depredations on this property might be committed, an act of parliament was passed in the year 1752 to secure the property, by subjecting the stealer and the receiver to the same punishment as for felony. In the preamble to this act the black lead is described as necessary to the casting of bomb-shells, round shot, and cannon-balls ; its chief use is now for making pencils : the coarser sort is employed in the composition of crucibles, and for giving a black polish to"], [149, "CUMBERLAND. CXXV to iron, &c.s The wadd or black lead is not found in regular veins, but lying in lumps or nodules in the fissures of the slate-rock, the lumps varying in weight from an ounce or less to upwards of 5olbs. When the mine is opened, a sufficient quantity is procured to answer the demand for several years ; the black lead of the best quality is packed in barrels and sent to London by the waggon, the proprietor of which is bound in a considerable sum for its safe delivery. It is then deposited in the cellars under the Unitarian Chapel in Essex Street ; and on the first Monday in every month there is a sale of it in an upper room of a public-house in the neighbourhood. The pencil-makers attend, and selecting pieces of the best quality, purchase according to their respective wants. The coarser sort is afterwards sold for other purposes. About three thousand pounds worth of the black lead is sold in a year ; the price of that of the finest quality is 35s. per lb. ; of the coarser, 120I. per ton. Of late there has been some alarm as to the failure of this useful article. It is nearly four years since any quantity has been procured ; only three or four barrels were procured in 18 14, but we are informed that they have now better prospects. One half of the mine is the property of Henry Bankes, Esq. M. P. ; the other moiety is held by several proprietors under a lease for a long term of years, originally made by the person who, in conjunction with Mr. Bankes's ancestor, had a grant from the Crown. Limestone is very abundant in various parts of the county ; in the neigh bourhood of the sea-coast it is burnt in great quantities for exportation, particularly at Overend near Hensingham, and at Distington. From Overend about 340,000 Winchester bushels, and from Distington about 350,000 bushels are annually exported to Scotland, being carried in carts from Overend h to Whitehaven, and from Distington to Harrington to be shipped. The limestone quarries at Overend belong to the Earl of Lons dale ; those at Distington to the Earl of Lonsdale and William Walker, Esq. There are many lime works for inland consumption, as at All-hallows, Brigham, Cleator ', Hodbarrow in Millom, Ireby, Uldale, Sebergham, &c. Great quantities of lime are burnt in the parishes of Castle-Carrock, Den ton, and Farlam, for the supply of the whole barony of Gilsland. 8 Fuller says used by the felt-makers for colouring hats. Twelve hundred Cumberland bushels, equal to 3600 of Winchester measure, are sometimes shipped in a day from Overend. 1 The lime from Cleator was exported some years ago, to the quantity of about 400 bushels in a day. (Hutchinson.) Gypsum,"], [150, "CUMBERLAND. CXXVI Gypsum, or alabaster, is found in considerable quantities in the parishes of Wetherall, St. Cuthbert, and in St. Bees, on the sea-coast, about a mile from Whitehaven, whence five or six hundred tons are annually exported to Dublin, Liverpool, and Glasgow, where it is principally used in the composition of stucco. There are many quarries of excellent freestone in various parts of the county, and for grindstones at Ivegill, Barngill near Whitehaven, &c. Considerable quantities, both of red and white freestone, from the quarries in the neighbourhood of Whitehaven, are shipped from that port for Dublin, Scotland, and the Isle of Man ; grindstones, both from the red and white freestone quarries, are also exported in considerable quantities. Mr. Senhouse has a quarry of excellent freestone at Maryport, from which a considerable quantity has been exported. The fine pier at Douglas, in the Isle of Man, was built of this freestone. There are quarries of excellent blue slate in the townships of Ulpha, Cockermouth, Buttermere, Borrowdale, Bassenthwaite, and elsewhere. Mr. T. Denton speaks of the latter as esteemed (1688) the best blue slate quarries in England, thin, light, and as smooth as glass, and says, that all people covet to have them who live within any convenient distance. The Buttermere slates are now held in most esteem. We cannot learn that any of the Cumberland slate is exported. Pencils of the Black-Comb slate are manufactured in the parish of Whicham and sent to London. Manufactures. Fuller speaks of Cumberland as a county wholly destitute of manu factures in 1662, except one of coarse broad cloth at Cockermouth (then lately set up and vended at home,) and one of fustian, set up at Carlisle in 1660; he adds, I wish the undertakers may not be disheartened with t,heir small encouragement. It is certain, nevertheless, that there had been manufactures in Cumberland at a very early period. A charter of William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle, mentions fulling mills at Cockermouth and Deerham m the reign of Henry III. Mr. T. Denton, writing in 1688, mentions iron forges at Millom, and says, that there were several very good fulling mills in Bassenthwaite, where they dressed woollen cloths, called Skiddaw greys, a good wearing cloth, of which there was a great manufacture. There is still a manufactory at Keswick of coarse woollen cloths, blankets, &c. The principal scene of manufactures 1 1 is"], [151, "CUMBERLAND. CXXVII is at Carlisle, where the cotton manufactory is carried on to a great extent, the spinning, the making of ginghams, and other articles, and cotton printing. The manufactures at Carlisle employ a great number of looms in the neighbouring towns and villages. Mention will be found of the rise and increase of this manufacture, and of other disused manufactures in the account of Carlisle. There are considerable cotton works also at Dalston, Corby, Warwick-bridge, Penrith, &c. At Whitehaven, Cleator, and Egremont, are large manufactories of sail-cloth. There are iron founderies at Seaton near Workington, at Dalston, and at Carlisle ; paper mills at Cockermouth, Egremont, and Kirk- Oswald; a carpet manufactory at Carlisle, a pottery of coarse earthen-ware long established at Deerham ; earthen-ware is also made at Whitehaven, and a new manufactory is erect ing at the Ginns for fine ware, similar to that of Staffordshire : there is an extensive manufactory of glass bottles also at the Ginns. At White haven, Maryport, and Workington, are several ship-building yards, and every kind of manufactory connected with the shipping. There were formerly some considerable salt-works at Bransted (near Whitehaven,) Nether-hall, and Workington\". The process of making salt in pans by evaporation, has been wholly discontinued in Cumberland. Ports and Havens. Skinburness was formerly a haven of some importance, and was in the reign of Edward III. the rendezvous of the English fleet employed against Scotland. The chief ports of Cumberland at present are Whitehaven, Workington, Maryport, and Harrington. About the year 1688, the chief exports from Whitehaven1 were coals; salt from the pans at Bransted and Workington ; grindstones from St. Bees Cliff; a corn exportation trade had then just commenced, chiefly for oats and big : the imports were French wines and brandy from Bourdeaux andNantz; fir, deals, pitch, tar, and cordage, from Denmark and Norway; and tobacco and sugar canes from the West-Indies. Besides the staple article of coals, the chief exports from Whitehaven at present are lime, freestone, and alabaster, to Scotland and Ireland ; great quantities of k T. Denton's MS. 1688.

There is a considerable exportation of flour, oatmeal, and bacon, coastways. The chief imports are West-Indian, American, and Baltic produce ; flax and linen, horses, oxen, and pigs from Ireland, and pig-iron from Wales, all to a very considerable extent. The chief exports at Workington, Maryport, and Harrington, are coals, and at the latter lime and some copperas to Liverpool ; the imports are chiefly timber, hemp, and other commodities from North America and the Baltic ; linen cloth, flax, and oxen from Ireland ; and at Workington pig iron for the Seaton works. Corn, flour, oatmeal, and bacon, are exported in considerable quantities coastways from Ravenglas ; timber is imported at Bowness from America. Coals were exported from the harbour of Parton till the year 1795, when the pier was washed away by a high tide. Antiquities. British Antiquities. \u2014 Of the rude memorials of the early inhabitants of this island, a considerable number occur in the county of Cumberland, the largest and most complete of these is the circle of stoeies called Long Meg and her daughters, in the parish of Addingham, on the road from that place to Little-Salkeld ; this circle is 350 feet in diameter, and consists of stones of various kinds, and of unequal height ; some above nine feet high, and others hardly appearing above the surface of the earth ; on the south side, at the distance of about seventeen paces from the circle, stands a single upright stone, eighteen feet high, from which this monument derives its name, and between this and the circle are two others of smaller size, forming a sort of square projection from the south side of the circle. Another circle of stones, on a much smaller scale, but more entire than the one just described, is situated on the summit of a smooth hill, sur rounded with very grand mountain scenery, about a mile and a half south- east"], [153, "CUMBERLAND. CXXIX east of the town of Keswick, on the south side of the road to Penrith. It is not quite circular, the diameter being about 34 yards from north to south, and nearly 30 from east to west0. The largest of the stones does not exceed eight feet in height. On the eastern side is an oblong inclosure, about 10 feet 'by 20, formed by ten stones, and connected with the circle. A third circle of stones, of the same kind, called the Grey Yawd, is described by Nicolson and Burn, as being on the summit of the fell called King Harry, in the parish of Cumwhitton, consisting of about 88 stones, set in an exact circle of about 52 yards in diameter ; one single stone, larger than the rest, standing out of the circle, about five yards to the north west p. At a place called Swinside, near Millum, is a circle of stones, called Sunken-Kirk q, and part of another near it r. In the year 1790 Hayman Rooke, Esq. communicated to the Society of Antiquaries an account of three stone chests, formed of dressed stones, fitted close at the sides without cement, which he had discovered within a circular earth-work, 63 feet in diameter at the top, which was level : within this area six large stones were remaining near the centre, which Mr. Rooke supposed to have been part of a circle of stones s. Many of the rude weapons and tools of the early inhabitants of Britain, formed of hard stone or flint, and resembling those of the South Sea Islands, have been discovered in Cumberland ', particularly in the south-west part, near the sea-coast u.

It is therefore reasonable to expect, that the roads and towns of the first inhabitants should have been discovered in equal numbers ; but as it was a frontier province during much of the time the Romans maintained themselves in the island, and fortified by that people in every part with particular attention, the civil works of the Britons seem to have been very generally defaced, or altered by the conquerors for their own use, while the religious ones were reserved because they were neglected. \" We have, however, every reason to presume that the British towns were connected in this county, as in every other, by British roads, and that one great trackway in particular ran from the banks of the Eamont to Carlisle, nearly in the line of the present turnpike road ; especially as this road, after passing Carlisle, proceeds evidently towards Birrenswork, and Woodcastle, in Annandale, throwing off a branch north-east to Castleover, all which, as may be seen by the plans of them in General Roy's worky, were British fortresses of considerable importance ; and this idea receives great confirmation from its being allowed that one division of the Roman army under Agricola advanced into Scotland by this very road, which he certainly had no leisure to make, and which was therefore probably before his time, as it remains at this day, the great communication between the western and northern part of the island. The Maiden way from Kirby-Thore to Bewcastle seems also to have been another of these British trackways. The British towns, as well as their roads, have been mostly defaced by the residence of their conquerors, whose neglect or occupation of them, during so long a period, were equally fatal. The name of Old-Carlisle would lead us to include it in the number, as was the case with Old-Sarum, Old-Winchester, Old- Oswestry, and perhaps Old-Durham ; but it has only its name to plead, the situation and remains are clearly Roman. Mr. Whitaker contends that Volantium and Axelodunum were both originally British fortresses, raised by the Volantii against their neighbours the Selgov\u00e6 ; but he rests on little authority except etymology, the weakest ground on which a theorist ean stand. z Castle-Carrock, besides its name, \" the castle on the rock,\" has \u00bb See Plates VIII.

Walls- Castle, on the coast near Ravenglas, produces also strong pretensions to the same origin, for though supposed to be only the first residence of the Pen nington family, it bears marks of having been occupied by far earlier inhabit ants, as not only coins, both Saxon and Roman, but stone axes, and arrow heads of flint, the undoubted arms of our Celtic ancestors, have been frequently dug up round it. \" But the town which appears to have the fairest claim to be considered British, is Carlisle itself. It is situated on the British trackway, the prin cipal communication between the western and northern parts of the island, on which several cities of the first natives appear, as I before observed, to have been built at proper distances ; and was inhabited by the Romans, as is proved by their coins and altars, though a Roman station lies in its immediate neighbourhood. Our antiquaries too seem to have been more fortunate than usual in tracing its Celtic name through its Latin one of Lugoballium. Lug is a tower or fortress ; Lugo Augmti is Turris Augusti, in Mela. Lugdunum is the fortress on the hill ; Lugoballium may be the fortress near the Vallum. The circumstance of its not being garrisoned at the time of the Notitia, which seems to have puzzled Horsley, is in favour of its British origin ; for though the Romans inhabited the town, as they did other towns of the natives, using it as a vicus to their neighbouring station, they naturally preferred a fortress constructed according to their own rules ; and the garrison of Congavala, which was only four hundred yards from it, was to all military purposes the garrison of Carlisle also. Richard of Cireeicester too expressly mentions Luguballiian among the British cities. \" Though there is little reason to doubt of this being the fact, it is only on Roman ground that we can tread with certainty. In tracing the Roman wall, we meet, at unequal distances, but in the most advantageous military positions, several large fortresses surrounded by deep ditches, defended by high walls of earth or stone, and containing within their area, altars, in scriptions, coins, and other marks of that enterprizing and intelligent people. These fortresses, Avhich are invariably of a square or oblong form, are each of them capable of containing a garrison of a Roman cohort (about 600 men), and each of them has on the side sloping to a river, or to the southern sun, a vicus, or small village, for the families and followers of the troops.

D. 21 o, Severus constructed a wall of hewn stone to the north of Hadrian's line, protected by 300 small turrets within call of each other ; by 8 1 large towers, at intervals of a mile each, and by 1 8 large stations, at the average distance of four miles : the whole forming a regular and compact defence from the east to the west sea : and that finally, about the year 448, when the Romans were on the point of leaving the island, their general, Gallio of Ravenna, assisted the British inhabitants in giving the wall of Severus a complete repair. This extraordinary work, after having endured the frosts and tempests of above 1600 winters; the violence of the Barbarians, who forced their way through it in many parts ; the plunder of the neighbouring in- habitants, whose fences, houses, and churches, have been all raised from its materials, and the still more destructive ruin of those enemies to an tiquity, our modern turnpike roads, is yet seen in many parts, running proudly over the mountains and wastes of the north, at an elevation even 1 A comparison of the several passages respecting the walls of Hadrian and Severus in the works of Spartian, Eutropius, Aurelius Victor, and Orosius, will clearly shew that the agger of earth with its ditches, &c. was the work of Hadrian, and that the stone-wall was erected by Severus, though the terms murus and vallum are indifferently applied to both. It is perfectly clear that two lines of fortification were formed by the two emperors from sea to sea, and it would be absurd to suppose that the bank of earth should have been formed forty years after she wall of stone.

Its length from Cosins house, three miles east of Newcastle, where the depth of the river Tyne formed a sufficient defence against the enemies' incursions, to the station at Bowness, beyond which the breadth of the Solway Frith answered the same purpose, is about seventy-four miles. It was constructed according to the common mode used in Roman build ings, with a facing of free stone on both sides, having the internal part b Very little at present remains of that part of the wall of which was within the county of Cumberland, where it commences on the west side of a small stream, called Poltross- Burn, at the distance of about two miles from the station of Carvorran, in Northumberland. The wall is only seen occasionally as a green bank till it reaches the station of Burdoswald, a mile and a quarter further westward, at a small distance from the west side of which, the face of the wall appears in some places to the height of above three feet six inches, consisting of five courses of hewn stone, one of which is nine inches thick, and the others eight. The stone in this part of the wall appears to have been brought from the rocks on the river Gelt, where the Roman inscription still remains, and those on the river Irthing above Naworth castle, where the name of Severus remains inscribed. Much of the wall, which had been covered with earth and overgrown with hedges, was laid open in the years 1807 and 1808, in consequence of the inclosure of Banks-Fell, and the lower parts of several of the watch towers were discovered at Banks-Head, but the whole was destroyed for the materials, except in a few places, where some of the lower courses of stone, serving as the foundation of the modern fences, have been preserved, and are likely to remain. In this neighbourhood the course of the wall may be distinguished at a distance by the line of cottages and other buildings, which have been erected from its remains. At Harehill, about half a mile north of Lanercost priory, a piece of the wall remains, ten feet high and fifteen feet long; Mr. Hutton, who walked along the wall in the year 1801, and noted every fragment of it that then remained, says, that he saw no part higher than this, which was within two feet of the battlements, but all the facing stones had been taken away. Except near this place, no further traces of the wall are to be seen above ground, till within about a mile of its termination, on the Solway Frith, where at a place called Kirkland, a piece several hundred yards in length, is to be seen about three feet high, with a hedge growing on it; the facing stones have been taken away; the progress of cultivation having in most parts entirely obliterated all traces of this great work. In the year 1791, the remains of the wall were dug up for nearly half a mile, near Castle steeds, which gave Mr. Johnson, the proprietor of that station, an opportunity of examining its construction, who found that the breadth of the foundation was eight feet ; the wall where entire, being faced on both sides with hewn stone, \" and the space between filled with rubbish stones to the depth of a foot ; then a strong cement of lime and sand, about four inches thick ; over that a foot of rubbish, and then a cover of cement as before ; these layers were succeeded by others, of rubbish and cement alternately, till the interstice between the facing stones was filled up to the top, and thus the whole became one solid connected mass.\" ( Arch\u00e6ol. Vol. xi. p. 63.) In some other parts of the wall, where the facing stones have been taken away, the whole of the internal part seems to have been formed like the thick walls in our ancient castles, with stones of all sizes grouted with liquid mortar. L. 4- filled"], [158, "CUMBERLAND. CXXXIV filled with loose rubble stones, with hot mortar poured plentifully over them, which forms a mass not to be separated even at present without much difficulty. Indeed this firmness of construction furnishes a strong argument against the idea, that so magnificent a work, the principal materials of which must often have been brought from a distance, with its turrets small and large, its military roads, its ditches and its stations, was hastily raised by a single legion under Gallio, in the moment of terror and despair at aban doning the island ; or of the British provincials, harrassed as they had been for centuries by the inroads of the Barbarians, divided by the quarrels and wars of their chiefs, and uninterested as the greatest part of them were, in a work which could only protect this northern district. \" The wall itself was attended,\" as Horsley observes, \" by a small military way, which went directly from turret to turret close by its side, and by a larger paved road attending the Castella, often falling in with Hadrian's north Agger, which it uses as a road whenever it is convenient for the purpose. This Agger, which some suppose to have been itself an old military road, has been the best passage between the stations ; and when the line of the stations fetched a compass, another distinct military way was laid, joining two of the stations that were more remote, as in Northumberland, from Walwick to Carvorran : and I have reason to apprehend the like was done in Cumberland from Carvorran, or at least from Cambeck fort to Stanwix.\" The principal military road, which goes by the name of the larger road of Severus, and is very plain in the neighbouring county of Northumberland, disappears at Foultown, just before it reaches the borders ; Severus perhaps using the north Agger of Hadrian, which is tolerably distinct in this part of its course. But soon after entering Cumberland, the military way is seen at Willowford, to the south of both Severus and Hadrian's works. It appears also on crossing the Irthing, where the bank being steep it slopes down on one side to the river and up on the other. And probably passed a little to the south of Burdoswald, which lies on the wall itself. \" The road is very conspicuous between High-House and Walbours, and there is a visible castellum here, to which it ascends. Soon after this, the ground being ploughed, the walls themselves become obscure, and the road -is completely lost for some miles, not being at all found near Cambeck fort, which is the next station, but on approaching Watchcross, between that fort and the wall, it is quite plain in a direction from Cambeck fort towards High-Crosby, as if bearing for Stanwix, from hence to the west nothing more has been discovered of it, though Horsley thinks that at Warmanby iz he"], [159, "CUMBERLAND. CXXXV he saw something like it, and that near Burgh the peasants strike the plough on a pavement, which he supposes must be in its line. \" A second Roman road, and one of the most considerable in the north, traverses the whole county from Westmorland to the wall, in the line as I observed of a great British track-way. It is mentioned in the second and fifth of Antonine's iters, and the eighth and tenth of Richard's, and seems to have crossed the Eamont, where the present turnpike road does, and proceeded with it directly north, to the stations at Plumpton-wall and Carlisle. Near the former, which it approaches within 200 yards, it was at least 2 1 feet broad ; it passed the wall at Stanwix, and ran by the village of Blackford to Longtown, on the Eske, here it throws off another large road to the north-east, which goes evidently to the station at Netherby, and from thence to a Roman post at the junction of the Eske and Liddel, (afterwards a border fort of considerable note under the name of Liddel's- Strength,) and aster passing these rivers is traced to Castle-over, evidently a British, and afterwards a Roman city. The principal road, however, after sending off this branch, crosses the Eske at Longtown, and as some writers contend, leaves Solway Moss on its left, and goes directly through Gretna Green, and so into Annandale, but Horsley supposes with more appearance of reason, that it runs through the centre of the Moss, passes the Sark at Barrowslacks, and through the Procestrium of the Roman camp at Burrens, in its way to the northern Vallum ; and this opinion is confirmed by a modern writer, who seems to have examined the traces of the ancient ways in Scotland with much sagacity and success. c \" Among the moors on the east borders of the county, a third road is evidently to be traced under the name of the Maiden Way, a term familiar to all persons conversant in these matters of antiquity, and supposed by Warton to be corrupted from the British word, Madan, \" Fair.\" It leaves the Roman road at Kirby-Thore, goes between Cross-Fell on its right, and Kirkland on its left, and is seen in the east parts of Ousby, Melmerby, and Addingham parishes, but leaving the villages themselves far to the west, it is still in some places above 18 feet broad, but almost impassable from large stones, the fragments perhaps of its original pavement, crosses Black Burn, and running within two miles west of Aldstone, enters Northumber land, bearing plainly for Whitley-Castle, a well known station in that county, and from thence to Carvorran ; it passes the wall at Dead Water, and re-entering Cumberland, proceeds to the station at Bewcastle, which it leaves a little to the left, then under the name of the Wheel-Causeway, passes the Kirksop into Scotland, at Lamyford, crosses the Catrail, and is 1 See Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. i. book i. c. iv. supposed"], [160, "CUMBERLAND. CXXXVI supposed to fall into the eastern Watling-Street, perhaps near the station of Ad Fines. \" From the celebrated station above Maryport, no less than three Roman Roads have been discovered in different directions. One of these seems to have proceeded along the sea coast to the west end of the wall at Bowness, it is perfectly plain two or three miles beyond Allonby, and again near Old-Mawburgh, (which was certainly a small station on it,) and where last seen it evidently points for Bowness, going probably along the low grounds, where all remains of it would soon be lost ; nor is it at all visible between Allonby and Maryport, but the necessity of such a road to enable the garrisons on the west coast to march to the assistance of those on the wall, makes it probable that its line was extended in a south west direction to Moresby, and all the stations in that part of the county. A second military way from the same station has been more successfully examined. It leaves the village of Ellenborough on its right, and Dovenby on its left, and has been traced very plainly for six miles in that direction, to the Roman town at Papcastle, near Cockermouth, from whence there is reason to conclude it must have communicated with the station at Ambleside, The third of these roads passes through Mr. Senhouse's estate, crosses the road from Crosby to Cross-Canonby, goes through Allerby, over Outer side Common, through Baggerhay, over Boston pasture and Shaking-bridge, and by Red Deal, to the station at Old-Carlisle, which it leaves close on its left, coincides with the present turnpike-road over the Common, till it approaches near to the bridge over Wimpool, and joins it again at the village beyond Thursby, from which it proceeds in a straight line pointing to the cathedral at Carlisle. \" A Roman road which must have connected the stations of Ambleside aud Plumpton-Wall, and which is visible in its way at Kirkstone Hill, is seen again at Gowbarrow Park Head, near Ulswater, runs thence between two hills called Mill- Fells, to a camp of the name of Whitbarrow, near the eight mile stone on the turnpike-road from Keswick to Penrith, which was an intermediate station between the two Roman towns. It crosses this road in a direction from south-west to north-east, was entire a few years ago upon Greystock low Moor, till it was made a modern road leading to Grey stock ; then inclines to the left, and continues in a straight line towards Blencow, is still visible in a ploughed field 200 yards north of Little- Blencow, pointing at Couch-Gate, passes on the north side of Kulbarrow, runs through Cow-Close, where it was discovered in making the new road from Penrith to Cockermouth, which it crosses near the present toll-gate ; frorn"], [161, "CUMBERLAND. CXXXVII from hence it proceeds over Whitrigg, is visible again at the edge of the road on Fair-bank, and in Low-Street, so through the inclosures to the south gate of the station at Plumpton Wall. Another road, which is certainly Roman, came from the station at Brougham, through Stainton to Whit barrow, which was therefore a post of some consequence. \" Mr. Horsley (Brit. Rom. p. 482.) mentions his having had certain inform ation of a Roman road going from Ambleside towards Ellenborough ; and Stukeley asserts, that he saw one bearing from Moresby towards Papcastle. Both are probable ; as it is also that some communication must have existed between the inland stations and the coast to the west of Moresby ; as also between Moresby and Ambleside, and between Plumpton Wall and Whitley Castle : but the Roman wall, and such roads as are immediately connected with it, seem to have attracted the exclusive attention of the Cumberland antiquaries, and it is only from intelligent gentlemen resident in the county that authentic information on these subjects can be given to the public. c \" I shall proceed to follow the Roman stations in Cumberland in the same manner as I have done their roads, first examining such as are on the wall itselfj then such as are connected with it, and finally such as may be in other parts of the county. In following the course of the wall from North umberland, about two miles from the eastern limits of the county, we meet the station of Burdoswald, one of the most decided on the whole line. It touches the wall, which here forms its northern rampart, so that the garrison could command the country beyond, by marching out at its northern gate. And as this is also the case with several other stations, it will account both for the very few other passages or gates in the wall, and for this position of the fortresses so close to the wall i,self. The ditch, gates, and rampart, e We have been favoured, by the Rev. Jos. Fullerton, with the following particulars of a Roman road leading from Egremont Castle to Cockermouth: \u2014 \" This road passed in a direct line through the Town-head and the Wood-end estates, in the parish of Egremont ; through the Cleator-hall estate, and close by the village of Cleator ; through the estate of Todholes, in which it is now (1815) digging up, and part of the Warth estate, in the parish of Cleator; through the parish of Arlochden and township of Frisington ; through the parish of Lamplugh, and close by Lamplugh Cross and Street-gate, and approaches Cockermouth in a straight line. The road is eighteen feet wide, and formed of cobbles and freestone, all seemingly gathered from the adjacent grounds.\" This appears to be the same road of which the following mention is made in Hutchinson's History of Cumberland: \" Near Eaglesfield (in the parish of Brigham) was lately discovered in various places, a little below the surface, an old paved way, seven yards in width, bearing north and south, formed of large flat stones, chiefly of freestone.\" Vol. ii. p. 106. note.

The turrets on each side the south gate are still visible, and nearly opposite that entrance, the remains of what seems to have been the praetorium : the ruins of a temple have also been discovered in another part of the area. In Horsley's time, the foundations of the houses were so plain, that the breadth of the streets could be measured, which, according to the Roman fashion, were extremely narrow. The situation is well chosen, a rising ground with a descent to the river Irthing, and just between the two walls, that of Hadrian seeming to have fallen in with its southern rampart, as the larger work of Severus did with its northern one. Altars and inscriptions abound, from whence the name of the place is known ; for no less than fifteen inscriptions, found at Burdoswald, men tion the Cohors Prima \u00c6lia Dacorum, and the Notitia expressly mentions this cohort as having composed the garrison of Amboglanna, one of the fortresses on the wall. \" At the distance of about six miles and a quarter further is Castlesteads-, or Cambeck fort, so called from its situation on the Cambeck. e It is about 400 yards south of the wall ; and this, with the smallness of its size, has led some antiquaries to conjecture that it was originally one of Hadrian's or perhaps of Agricola's line of forts, and applied by Severus to his own pur poses. The situation, however, is convenient from its nearness to the river, a point to which the Romans were always attentive. An inscription mentioning the sixth legion has been found here. The estate upon which the station stood * Gordon, speaking of Burdoswald, says, \" this whole castellum has been surrounded with a stately wall of freestone, about five feet thick, as may be fairly measured at this day.\" Itin. Septentrionale, p. 80. L. \" Castlesteads (or steeds) is a name given to several of the castella on the Roman walls, the latter part of the name (from the Saxon steel) serving to express the foundations or traces of buildings, as House-steads, Kirksteads, &c. Many discoveries of Roman antiquities within the site of this station have been recorded, besides the numerous inscribed stones noticed by Gordon and Horsley. About the year 1740, ahypocaust was discovered here, 15 feet by 27, the floor of which was supported by stone pillars, about two feet six inches high, fixed in a bed of clay ; and funnels of burnt clay, placed in the quincunx form between every other row of the pedestals ; there were above 100 of the stone pedestals, on which were laid stones an inch thick. Two other rooms were found adjoining this hypocaust, with floors of terras supported in the same manner ; and a cold bath, with a sort of cistern, fifteen feet by four feet six inches, composed of large thick slates set edgeways and cemented together. A particular account of this discovery is given in the Gen tleman's Magazine for 1742, p. 76. In 1791, the remains of this station were dug up, and a particular account of the Roman antiquities then discovered was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by the late Professor Carlisle, which is printed in the eleventh volume of the Archaeologia.

It is supposed to be the ancient Petriana, which is mentioned in the Notitia, as the next fort to Amboglanna, and the garrison having been a body of cavalry, was well suited to its greater distance from the wall. \" About three miles west of this station, and nearly one from the wall, is Watchcross, conjectured to be the Roman Aballaba ; and here too a body of Moors (probably cavalry, as their country was famous for it,) composed a garrison proper for the distance. It is remarkable that there are two sta tions, somewhat detached, or to the south of the wall, in Northumberland ; viz. Little Chesters, and Carvorran; and two under the same circumstances in Cumberland; viz. Castlesteads, and Watchcross ; and traces of a military road are yet to be seen, which connected these independent stations, as we may term them, with eacli other : this certainly lends some countenance to the idea I have just mentioned, that these four fortresses formed part of Hadrian's or Agricola's Pr\u0153tentur\u0153. The station, if it be one, is cer tainly the smallest on the line, nor have any antiquities been found in it ; the form, however, is certainly Roman. '\u00ab Of the next station no doubt has ever been entertained. It is at Stanwix, just opposite Carlisle, the name supposed to have been Congavata. Its northern rampart, as at Amboglanna, is formed by the wall itself, and from its north gate the great military way proceeded to the west part of the vallum of Antonine. The site is a good one, on a south bank sloping to the Eden. The church stands within the area of the station, and the descent to the river is covered with ancient ruins of houses that extend into the streets of Carlisle itselfi which I have before contended was a British town occupied by the Romans, and used as a vicus or suburb for the garrison. The body of troops stationed here, as we know from the Notitia, was the second cohort of the Sergians. \" Burgh on the Sands, about four miles and a half from Stanwix, was Axelodunum. Whitaker supposes it British also, and derives the name from Axel o dun, \" the dry town,\" which well enough expresses its situation.

CXL in a low meadow about 200 yards east of the present church. Hadrian's rampart seems to have ended here. g Many stones of the wall of Severus have been dug up at Easton near this place. \" Somewhat more than four miles farther west, at Drumburgh, on a hill above the marsh, are the evident remains of another station, probably Ga brocentum; the site is now a garden or orchard, the ramparts perfectly plain, and the fosse still deep. The castle formerly belonging to the Dacre family, and now to the Earl of Lonsdale, a large farm-house, was raised from its ruins. \" At the end of the lane, one mile from Boldness, the wall of Severus is visible for the last time, in a close on the left of the road, six feet high and three thick, pointing to a spot supposed to be the site of the only remaining station, Tunnocelum. It is on a rock hanging over the Frith of Solway, which then from its depth became a sufficient defence to the Roman province. Even after the lapse of so many centuries, the passage over the water is sometimes dangerous \\ and the slightest inspection of it will con vince a spectator how much the sea must have lost since the year 210, in both depth and width. The bearing of the Roman road from Maryport to the spot points out this rock as the Roman station. Coins too, and other remains, (particularly an altar dug up 1783,) have been found in a field a little to the south of it : and the Notitia, placing a marine cohort at Tun nocelum, suits the situation of Boulness so well as to put the matter out of all reasonable doubt. \" In examining these stations on the wall, which we have now finished, every traveller has remarked how much closer together the Roman garrisons were placed on the west than on the east side of it ; for which, the circum stance of the great communication between the north and east parts of the island being by this western road, and the neighbourhood of Ireland, filled at that time by tribes of free and gallant barbarians, afford a very sufficient reason. possession of the Earl of Lonsdale at Lowther Castle.

CXLI '* But besides the fortresses on the wall itself) there appear to have been several others, constructed with much military judgment at different points to the south of it, for the purpose of bringing forwards additional troops to the support of any part which might be attacked ; and we learn from the Notitia, that the garrisons of these latter stations consisted in most instances of cavalry, which were best suited to such a purpose. As all these posts were maintained by the Romans to the last moment of their keeping any force in the island, they are very decidedly marked by altars, coins, and other traces of this nation, and in general by the more perfect state of their ramparts. We know indeed from the Notitia, that they were actually held by them so late as the beginning of the fifth century, being garrisoned nearly to that period by auxiliaries of the sixth legion ; and from Claudian, that the sixth legion continued in Britain till it was recalled by Stiticho in his last struggles to defend Italy against the barbarians, \" Venit et extremis Legio Pr\u0153tenta Britannis.\" Among these supporting stations we may reckon, i. Ellenborough ; 2. Pap castle ; 3. Old Carlisle ; 4. Old Penrith ; 5. Moresby ; and another, (Bre metenracuni) whose exact site is not known. They are classed under a general but not very intelligible name in that curious record the Notitia, being called \" Stationes per lineam valle.\" \" The station at Ellenborough is on the north side of the mouth of the little river Ellen, on a hill above Maryport. It is a square of 400 feet, surrounded by a fosse and double rampart, commanding a view of the coast on each side the Solway Frith, and of the sea to a considerable extent, for which purpose this site seems to have been chosen : the prospect is assisted by a large exploratory mount, or rather barrow, though when opened nothing was discovered in it but the bones of an ox ; the workmen most probably, from their ignorance, having missed the real spot of inter ment, as has sometimes happened even to the more experienced labourers of Sir Richard C. Hoare, in his accurate researches on the Wiltshire downs. Few places have furnished more antiquities than this station, from which it appears that the garrison was composed, at different times, of the first cohort of the Spaniards, the first of the Dalmatians, of the Mauritanians, and of the Batavians. \" The Senhouse family, to whom the estate belongs, laid open the whole area in 1 766, with the laudable spirit of antiquarian curiosity so long in- herent"], [166, "CXLII CUMBERLAND. herent in their name. They found the arch of the gate beat violently down and broken ; and on entering the great street, discovered evident marks of the houses having been more than once burned to the ground and rebuilt, an event not unlikely to have happened on so exposed a frontier. The streets had been paved with broad flag-stones, much worn by use, particu larly the steps into a vaulted room, supposed to have been a temple. The houses had been roofed by Scotch slates, which, with the pegs that fastened them, lay confusedly in the streets. Glass vessels, and even mirrors, were found ; and coals had evidently been used in the fire-places. Foundations of buildings were round the fort on all sides, and coins and urns in great numbers. These, with the three roads known to have pointed towards the station, prove it to have been a large and populous town. Of its precise name there has been much doubt. It has been conjectured to be Olenacum, from the resemblance to the modern one ; Glannavanta, for the same reason, and as not unsuitable to the position of that town in the tenth iter of Anto nine ; Virosidum, because that is the most western station mentioned in the Notitia ; and Volantium, from the well-known altar found here, with the inscription \" Volanti vivas ;\" but on this it has been truly observed by Mr. Gough, that wishes of this sort for the health of an individual are not uncommon, and that Cureta vivas, and Fausta vivas, and Petrei bibas (for vivas), are found in Roman inscriptions. The real name, therefore, must remain still in uncertainty. \" The next station deserving our notice is Papcastle, on the Derwent, six miles south-east of the last, and connected with it by an evident Roman road. It lies in two closes called Boroughs, on a hill above the present village, and part of the ancient wall is still visible in the lane on the river side going towards Wigton. Coins and other antiquities have been fre quently discovered on the bank sloping from the fort to the south-west, the usual situation of the vicus. There is great reason to think its Roman name was Derventio, where the Notitia tells us a body of troops called the Numerus Derventionensis was quartered, and that it took its present name of Pap castle from Pipard, its Saxon owner. The town of Cockermouth, which is only one mile south of it, is supposed to have risen from the ruins of the ancient station. \" Another of these supporting stations, more considerable and better pre served, is at Old Carlisle, one mile south of Wigton. The Roman road leading from this station to Ellenborough one way, and to the wall the other, is very broad and visible. The fort was of an oblong figure, 500 feet by 400 ; and"], [167, "CUMBERLAND. CXLIII and buildings of a large vicus are round it, especially on each side of the road : the foundations were so plain in the time of Stukeley, that a plan might have been formed of all the streets. ' It appears, by inscriptions, that the Ala Augusta, a body of cavalry, were in garrison here for more than sixty years ; the Romans, as we well know, never changed the quarters of their troops without the most urgent necessity, and thus, by long residence, giving these Dalmatians, and Moors, and other strangers, a new city of their own, in the defence of which, their affection for their families, and the preservation of their acquired property, would give additional incitement to the spirit of military honour. Not only the Ala Augusta, but the Ala Gordiana, and the Ala Hercuka, are mentioned in other inscriptions found here ; from whence it has been conjectured, that this body of troops might have changed its name more than once, out of compliment to the reigning emperor. According to the Notitia, indeed, the Ala Herculea was stationed at Olenacum, which has led Horsley to suppose, in some parts of his work, that Olenacum was the name of this station, though in others, from the river Wiza, which runs near it, and the modern name of Wigton, only a mile from it, he feels inclined to call it Virosidum. \" The name of our next station, at Old Penrith, or, as it is oftener called, Plumpton- Wall, is much more decided, for here the itineraries come to our assistance, and the slightest inspection shews it to be the Voreda of An tonine and Richard, the distance from the neighbouring towns on both sides perfectly corresponding. The fort, containing an area of about three acres, lies on the Peterel, about 200 yards to the west of the present turn pike road, which we know to be the ancient Roman one : the ramparts are still high, and the fosse visible, as also the site of the Pr\u00e6toriumk. The foundations of the houses which formed the vicus, are discovered in abundance on the south-west descent to the river, and altars and coins as \u2022 The site of this station was purchased a few years since by the Rev. Richard Mathews, of Wigton, who has discovered there several inscriptions and other Roman antiquities. L. k In the year 181 1 a considerable portion of the wall on the east side of this station, was laid open for the purpose of obtaining ready hewn stone for some buildings on the adjoining farm. The remains of the gateway on this side were considerable, it was twenty-six feet six inches in width ; that on the south side was twelve feet three inches in width, and near it the walls remained to the height of four feet eight inches ; at two feet from the ground there was a set-off of nine inches. In consequence of these, and subsequent excavations, many Roman altars, coins, and other antiquities were dicovered, which will be noticed under the head of Miscellaneous Roman Antiquities. L. usual."], [168, "CUMBERLAND. cxliv usual. The Roman road from Ambleside falls into the great northern one at this station ; it was garrisoned also, like most of these supporting stations, by cavalry, the second cohort of Gallic horse ; Camden conjectured its name to be Petriana, misled by an inscription found here to the memory of Ulpius Trajanus, an Emeritus Al\u0153 Petrian\u0153, but we know from other au thority that Petriana was upon the wall, and the Emeritus may have died during an accidental residence at the station of Voreda, as the Decurio of the colony of Glevum, who is mentioned in an inscription found at Bath, probably died in the station of Aqu\u00e6 Solis, or Sulis. \" There is great reason to think Arbeia, another of these stations, men tioned in the Notitia, was at Moresby, two miles north-east of Whitehaven, though Camden was inclined to fix it at Irby. That there was a station at Moresby is evident by its remains, and it is one of the few instances in which the accuracy of Horsley has failed him ; for though lee allowed the inscriptions found here to be Roman, he has too hastily observed that there are hardly any marks of the station itself ; other antiquaries have been more fortunate in discovering it ; the site is in a field, on the side of the village, towards Barton, called the Crofts, and the church stands (as is often the case,) within its area. ' It is a square of 400 feet, on an eleva tion, overlooking several creeks still frequented by small craft, and shews that one reason of its being placed here was to protect the coast against the invasions of the northern and western pirates. The west Agger is perfectly plain, and the stones of the south wall still appear through the turf that covers them. A body of Africans formed its garrison ; Stukeley saw a Roman road pointing over the moors towards Pap castle ; but as if the spot was to be fatal to the characters of all our antiquaries, he has read Horsley 's 75th Cumberland inscription, which was found here, in a manner almost as erroneous, as his very ludicrous interpretation of the Greek line on the altar at Corbridge. m \" There was yet another of the supporting stations in Cumberland, though there is no certainty in what part of the county it lies, for among the sta tions per litieam valli, (whatever may be the meaning of that obscure and disputed phrase,) the Notitia reckons Bremetenracum, between Alione, which is supposed to be Whitley castle, and Olenacum, which is either 1 See the view of it in the annexed plate. m He mistakes \" Miles Cohortis Prim\u00e6 Thracum,\" which is very plain on the stone, (See Horsley, page 192.) for \" Militum Phractariorum Equestori.\" 9 Ellenborough,"], [169, ""], [170, "\u2022S.tyjoiu dthn"], [171, "lldilishsJ i tLn.Xlw.in Tiadeff * W Davits, .iir.in.t"], [172, ""], [173, "CUMBERLAND.

Camden, led by that fallacious guide to which he too often trusted, the resemblance of names, supposes it to be at Brampton, on the Irthing, nor is this situation in any respect ill suited to it. But few marks of Roman occupancy appear at Brampton, and the mount is certainly the work of a very different people. We are not even certain of a single Roman road bearing to or from it, which is not the case with any other of these stations\"1. On the whole, therefore, though there is a possibility of Brampton being the site of this Roman station, it cannot be produced as such with any degree of confidence. Castlesteads, in Stocklegarth parish, and Whitbarrow, between Plumpton-wall and Amble side, have equal if not better pretensions to it. \" Besides the five stations we have thus examined, which appear to have been placed some miles to the south of the wall, with a view of supporting any part that might be attacked, there are at least two others, supposed to have been connected with the wall on the north side, and to have been left as advanced posts in the enemies country, when the rest of the province was given up to the natives. Whether this was the case, or whether they were merely fortresses, built in the usual progress of Roman civilization, in that part of Britain, which by the useful labours of Roy and Chalmers, we now know to have abounded in flourishing cities and military roads, as much as any other district in the island, it is no part of our plan to ex amine ; it is sufficient for us to discover plain marks that they have been fortified and inhabited by the Romans. \" The first of these stations, and one the most likely to have been connected with the wall, from which a Roman road (as has before been observed,) passes near its gates, is Bewcastle. It is about eight miles from the Vallum, its ramparts distinct, and the ditch still deep. The site too is marked by coins, pavements, and inscriptions, by one of which we learn that it had been a Roman garrison so early as 121, the altar being de dicated to the Emperor Hadrian by two of his legions, (the second and twentieth,) which were employed at that time in building his Pr\u0153tentura, and whose head-quarters might be fixed here in advance, for the purpose of protecting the workmen. There is reason to think its Roman name was Apiatorium ; its modern one is derived from Bueth, one of its Saxon masters, whose castle, built as usual from the ruins of the station, still exists in the north-west corner of its area. \u00bb Major Rooke, speaks of Roman antiquities as being frequently found there, but those of an inferior sort, the furniture it may be of a villa, or the plunder of a camp. See Ar ch\u00e6ologia, ix. Plate 17. Vol. IV. t \" Another"], [174, "CUMBERLAND. cxlvi \" Another station of this kind, advanced several miles north of the wall, but communicating with it like the last, by a plain Roman road, is at Netherby on the Esk : here too coins, altars, baths, and the foundations of streets running down to the river, point out a considerable town. Horsley was much inclined to place here the Castra Exploratorum of the itinerary, an idea which may receive some countenance from a discovery made since his time, of a riding school for the Roman cavalry, \" Basilica Equestris Exercitatoria ;\" and from the circumstance of Riechester, in Northumberland, which is advanced several miles from the east side of the wall, as this is on the west, being garrisoned by the same species of troops, Exploratores, as if for the same purpose. The site too on elevated ground, especially as connected with the very commanding Roman post on the Liddel, about two miles off, would be well suited for a body of scouts, and the itinerary distance from Luguballium suits well, as Roy has observed, to Netherby. Be the name, however, what it may, there is no doubt that Netherby was a Roman station of consequence, advanced north of the wall, but within the limits of the county. \" Among the Roman towns in Cumberland, and in some degree connected with the wall, which it in a manner touches, it is impossible to omst Car lisle itself, though originally, as I have before observed, it may have been a city of the Britons. That it was inhabited, however, by the Romans, and known to them under the name of Luguballium, there is no difficulty to prove. The Itineraries, our surest guides, represent Luguballium, as thirteen miles north of Voreda ; we know Voreda to be Plumpton-wall, and as Carlisle is at the same distance, in the same direction from that station, it answers directly to Luguballium. In the same Itineraries the distances from Brocavum (Brougham,) to Luguballium, and from Bro covonac\u0153 (Kirby-Thore,) to the same place, answer also to Carlisle, and to Carlisle only ; and to make the point clearer if possible, the town is called in Antonines fifth iter Luguballium ad Vallum, or \" upon the wall,\" a description which is peculiarly that of Carlisle. That Carlisle was occupied by the Romans the altars, coins, and other remains of that people, which are found in abundance even at this day, most fully demonstrate ; and among others we have the authority of William of Malmsbury for asserting, that in the time of William the Second, a Roman building, which the his- torian calls a Triclinium still existed in this city n, with an inscription Venerable Bede too in his life of St. Cuthbert mentions another Roman work as existing at Carlisle in the year 685. \" Postera autem die deducentibus cum civibus ut videret m\u0153nia civitatis, fontemque in ea miro quondam Romanorum opere extructum.\" Cap. xxvii. 11 supposed"], [175, "CUMBERLAND cxlvii supposed by our early antiquaries to be \" Marii Victori\u0153,\" but which it has been since ingeniously conjectured, ought to have been read, Marti Victori, and that it was in reality a Roman temple. It may be worth while also, to mention that a late traveller, Mr. Hutton, (who, though not much conversant in antiquity, is a faithful and honest narrator of every thing he saw, and who at the age of 78 walked carefully along the whole course of the Roman wall, writing down his observations on the spot,) expressly tells us \u00b0, that the Vallum, after crossing the Eden opposite Carlisle, makes an evident bend to the north, as if to enclose the city within its line, a circumstance which must lead us to think it was a place of im portance at the time this Pr\u0153tentura was formed. On the whole, therefore, we may conclude, that Carlisle was probably a British town, connected with the wall by its accidental neighbourhood, and in consequence of that neighbourhood occupied by the Romans under the name of Luguballium. \" Besides the stations and towns already mentioned, the following places seem to bear marks of having been at some period fortified or possessed by the same people. \" Such is the camp near Mawburgh or Malbray, on the north-west coast, which I mentioned as being probably a small military station on the road from Ellenborough to Bowness. It is now a ploughed field, but old men still speak of its having been walled round, and a stone has been dug up within the area, with an inscription making mention of the second cohort of the Pannonians ; this puts the circumstance of its being a Roman post out of all reasonable doubt. \" Upon Ponsonby-Fell, on the Calder, four miles south of Egremont, is a camp, believed to be Roman, but the ground not having been opened, nothing has been found to prove it. \" Egremont castle itself, from the herring-bone masonry in it, has an appearance of much antiquity, but its claim to be a Roman work, is equally uncertain with the last. p \" The two camps on Broadfield common, called Castlesteads and White stones, which are mentioned by Major Rooke in Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. ix. seem to be Roman by their shape, but the first has never been examined, and no antiquities were discovered when the latter was ploughed ; the situation, however, is well adapted for a station between Old- Penrith and Old-Carlisle, and the inhabitants contend there was a high raised way in that direction. It would suit too the position assigned to Bremetenrucum remarkably well. \u2022 Page 291. ' See the account of a Roman road leading to it, lately discovered in p. cxxxvii. note. L t 2 Irby,"], [176, "cxlviii CUMBERLAND* \" Irby, which Camden supposed from the likeness of name only, to be Arbeia, has a square camp, but no antiquities have been found near it. \" On a common called Eskmeals, in the parish of Bootle, in the south-west corner of the county, is an entrenchment certainly Roman, as coins and broken altars have been found in it, and it was doubtless one of the smaller stations constructed for the defence of the coast in that remote corner. \" On Cunningarth, near the Shawkbeck quarries, not far from Rose castle, is a small camp, only forty yards square, which seems to have been made to protect a working party of the second legion, who we know were em ployed here in digging stones for the wall. The quarries are still worked, and reckoned among the best in the county. \" In the parish of Kirkland is a camp of the same kind, for the protection of the soldiers of the twentieth legion, who were employed in the same work in that part of the country. \" There is a fort at Hardknot hill, in the parish of Muncaster, about 200 yards on the left of the present road from Whitehaven to Kendal. It is as nearly square as the ground will permit\"1, and from its situation and form appears evidently to have been made with a view of guarding one of the principal passes from the west coast into the inland country. The walls are of the stone of the neighbourhood, with four gates, which appear to have been arched with freestone brought from a distance, and beyond the east gate an esplanade, at the distance of 1 50 yards, has been formed with much trouble for the exercise or review of troops r.

The gates appear to have been flanked with turrets 1 3 feet square * ; and there were also turrets of the same dimensions at the four corners : within the area were the remains of buildings in which several rooms could be distinctly traced : the length of the different sides of the fort were, 362, 348, 347, and 323 feet. When we visited this work in the year 18 13, we observed, that no part of the walls was to be seen standing, the stones having been thrown down on both sides formed a high ridge, which in a spot more favourable to vegetation, would have long since been covered with turf; there did not appear to have been any mortar used in the walls.

The first notice taken of them was by Camden, who published five of the inscriptions in 1586, in the first edition of his Britannia : having visited Cumberland in the year 1599, with his friend Sir Robert Cotton, he increased the collection to the number of twenty-nine, in the enlarged edition of his work, published in 1600. In the edition of 1607, the last which was published by the author himself, they are increased to forty : a few more were added in Bishop Gibson's edition of the Britannia, in 1720. A good many of the Cumberland inscriptions are engraved in Gordon's ltinerarium Septentrionale, published in 1726, but though those engravings appear to have been intended for sac-similes, they do not express with any degree of accuracy, the exact form of the letters; as far as we have had an opportunity of comparing those figures with such of the originals as are at present preserved : nor are the inscriptions themselves by any means accurately copied. The same may be said of the Cumberland inscriptions, published in the second volume of Dr. Stukeley's Itinerary. In the year 1732 Mr. Horsley, in his exec11 nt work on the Roman an tiquities of Britain, published engravings of all the Roman altars, and inscribed and sculptured stones, which had been discovered at that time in Cumberland; the number of which then amounted to seventy-five: and illustrated them with explanations. As far as we have been able to compare the figures in Horsley 's work with the originals now existing, he appears to have copied the substance of the inscriptions with great accuracy, though the exact form of the letters is seldom preserved in his copies, and the figures of bas-reliefs are mere scrawls. Since Horsley's time many Roman altars and inscribed stones have been discovered in this county, and communicated to the public in several volumes of the Arch\u00e6ologia, and of the Gentleman's Magazine ; and several have been found of late years, which hitherto remain unpublished. The whole of the collection now amounting to 141, without including several of the sculptures in Horsley's work, will be found in the following Tables, in which sac-similes will be given of\" some of the most remarkable of those at present existing.

The second cohort of the Tungri is not mentioned in the Notitia, or in any other inscription found in Britain ; but it appears from a passage in Tacitus, that two cohorts of that people were in this island in the time of Agricola. In the last line but one there is a mistake of III. for II. as the Emperor Gordian was not three times consul : he was the colleague of Pompeianus, in his second consulate, A.D. 241. The inscription No. 24, was published by Camden, in 1607, in the en- larged edition of his Britannia. From the figure of it there given, it appears to have resembled the one last mentioned ; on one side was the thunderbolt, the other side was mutilated. The material parts of the inscription are sufficiently intelligible, though some words are obscure, probably from having been inaccurately copied.

Formerly, when only \u25a0Qiie or two altars had been found with the name of Belatucader, some doubt was entertained as to the deity it was intended to designate, but this has of late years been satisfactorily ascertained, since several have occurred, two of them in this county, (No. 37 and 41.

A copy of this inscription was commu nicated to the Society of Antiquaries by Hayman Rooke, Esq. in the year 1789; and in the following year some observations on it by Mr. Gough ', who reads it thus, \" Deo Marti Belatucadro et Ntaninibus Augustorum Julius Augustalis actor Julii Lupi prefccti\" and inclines to the opinion that Augustalis was the Agnomen of Julius, by whom the altar is dedicated, and that he was the actor or steward of Julius Lupus the pr\u00e6fect. The letters are all very plain, except the two L's in the last line but one, which are imperfect, but could not well have been any other letters. Mr. Gough supposes the Augg. to have referred to Severus and Caracalla, but some of the letters do not seem to be sufficiently well formed for the reign of Severus, and could hardly be older than that of Philip, or of Gallus, to either of which Emperors and their colleagues the term numina Augustorum would be applicable. Nos. 38 and 39 are only to be found in Camden's Britannia, having been lost before the publication of the works of Gordon and Horsley.

The name of Orusius occurs in Gruter. n The altar, of which No. 43 exhibits a sac-simile, is of very small dimensions, being only io| inches in height, and 4s wide in the widest part. The letters of the inscription are very rudely formed.

No. 44 exhibits a sac-simile of a small portable altar, about 54 inches by 2f , the whole of the inscription is very intelligible, except the name of the person by whom it was dedicated, which being much contracted and with out stops, may be read many different ways. The other parts of the inscription run thus, \" Deo Belatucadro posuit aram pro se et suis.\" When we saw this altar in the year 1808, it was in the possession of Mr. Wilson at West- end, in Burgh on the Sands, who told us that it was found between Burgh-castle and Wormelby. In the Gentleman's Magazine for 17490 is an inscription on a small portable altar found at Burgh on the Sands, which appears to have been dedicated to Belatucader ; but it is evidently so ill copied that we have not ventured to insert it. The seven following inscriptions, from No. 45 to 51, relate to Mars, under the local name of Cocidius, which also appears to have been much used at the station in the neighbourhood of the Roman wall. No. 45 was inscribed on the first altar which was discovered dedicated to this deity, and was published by Bishop Gibson in his additions to Camden's Britannia in the year 1722 ; Cocidius was not known to have been a name of Mars till the year 1797, when an altar was found at Lancaster, and communicated to the Society of Antiquaries, inscribed, \"Deo Sancto Marti Cocidio.\" Another (No. 51.) has been since found in Cumberland, inscribed, \" Deo Marti Cocidio.\" And two, Nos. 46 and 47, \" Sancto Cocidio.\" Corp.

No doubt it took its name from the Emperor Nerva, as those enti tled Hadriana and Antoniana did from Hadrian and Antoninus. The evo cati mentioned in this and the following inscriptions, are defined by Pitis cus, as veterans skilful in military affairs, who having completed their military services, voluntarily returned to the army, to oblige the consuls or generals. He observes that certain youths of the equestrian order, who performed the office of guards of the Emperor's bed-chamber, wve also denominated evocati, and supposes these were the same as are sometimes mentioned by the name of evocati Augusti. It is most probable, that the epithet palatinus in this inscription, refers to the office above-mentioned. No. 47. is inscribed on an altar found in the bed of a rivulet at Bewcastle, and communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by the late Professor Car lyle, in whose possession it then was: the inscription runs thus, \" Sancto Coci deo Titus Auruncusfelicissimus Tribunus ex evocato votum solvit lubens merito.\" Mr. Carlyle says, that he should \" consider ex evocato, as synonymous with quifuerat Evocatus, a mode of phraseology, though perhaps not very common in the best Latin writers, yet by no meana unfrequent in the later ones1.\" Two inscriptions occur in Reynesius b which leave no room to doubt that this opinion was correct. No. 48. is inscribed on a large altar three feet six inches high, which we saw in the year 1808 in the garden of a cottage at Howgill near the Roman wall, not far from Walton ; it has been since removed to Gilsland Spa, and is in the possession of Mr. William Bell of that place. On one side of the altar is the figure of a patera, and on the other, of a sacrificing-knife in bas relief.

The other \" Deo Cocidio Milites Legionis Vicessim\u0153 valentis victricis votum solverunt lubentes merito, Aper erexit et consecravit.\" The two last X's in the fourth line of this inscription are distinct, though slightly cut, and must have been introduced by mistake for two V's ; there having been no such legion in Britain as the fortieth ; and the twentieth which was honored with the epithets valens and victrix, having been long stationed on the Roman wall. On the base of the altar is the figure of a dog hunting a boar, in allusion to the name of Aper. No. 51 is inscribed on an altar found in the year 1813, at a place called Old- Wall, about six miles east of Carlisle, upon a farm belonging to Mr. Law, in the foundation of the wall of Severus. It is dedicated to Mars Cocidius by Martins, some officer, probably a centurion of the first cohort of the Dacians, whose head-quarters were at Amboglanna, now Burdoswald, as already noticed. The inscription runs thus, \" Deo Marti Cocidio Mar tins . . . Cohortis prim\u00e6 Dacorum, . . . Genio valli lubens merito.\" The words Genio valli, which were probably preceded by \" et,\" appear to have been omitted in their proper place, and come in awkwardly after the name of the person by whom the altar is dedicated. No altar has been hitherto found inscribed to this deity, but a great variety of Genii both of persons and places occur in ancient inscriptions. No. 52. Mr. Horsley observes upon this inscription that the only diffi culty is in the letters vitires, which make the name of a local deity, to whom an altar found in Northumberland was dedicated ; and adopts the reading suggested by Mr. Ward, \" Vit\u0153 restitutori.\" From an altar since discovered at Netherby, (No. 56.) inscribed \" Deo Vetiri sancto,\" it is more probable that Vitires in this inscription was intended to express the name of this deity joined with Mogon, and that an et has been omitted; unless they were different names of the same deity, and introduced in the same manner as Marti Belatucadro and Marti Cocidio. Mr. Horsley reads the name of the person by whom this altar was erected, \" Flavins \u00c6lius Secundus.\" The local deity Mogon, to whom this altar was inscribed, appears to have been worshipped by the Gadeni, an altar having been found in Northumber land, inscribed \" Mogonti Gadenorum.\" No. 53. \" Deo Mogti,\" inscribed on a small altar found at Plumpton wall, supposed by Mr. Horsley to have been erected to the same local deity Mogon.

No doubt the three Augusti originally alluded to, were Septimius Severus, and his two sons Caracalla and Geta. Mr. Carlyle further observes, \" that we have many altars dedi cated to the virtues of the Roman emperors, but to deify their mere insti tutions (for the word Discipulin\u0153, can only be a mis-spelling for Disciplin\u0153) seems a curious stretch of flattery.\" d No. 56.

The altar No. 59 was found in the year 1787, in making a drain in Scotch-Street at Carlisle ; it has no inscription; but on one side is a figure in bas-relief, which Mr. Rooke, by whom it was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries in 1789, supposes might be intended for a rural Arch\u00e6ologia, Vol. xi. p. 66.

The inscription (No. 62.) is on a very perfect altar discovered about the year 1740, in the remains of a hypocaust, at the same station as No. 61. and is now in the same collection. It was first published in the Gentle man's Magazine for 1740, by Mr. G. Smith, and in the year 1763, it was communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Taylor, Chancellor of Lincoln s.

The name of M. Aurelius Salvius appears in another inscription (No. 85.) found at this place : the Monogram which occurs after Hispanorum, is that which is well known as expressive of miliaria. The altar on which are the inscriptions (No. 63.) is the largest which has been discovered in Britain, being no less than five feet in height, it is formed of a dark reddish grit stone, and was found before the year 1559, at Ellenborough. It is now in the possession of the Earl of Lonsdale, at the castle at Whitehaven. An engraving of it was published by Camden in the year 1600, in the third edition of his Britannia, from a drawing made by his friend Sir Robert Cotton. The present state of this altar will be seen by the annexed plate, in which three of its sides are exhibited.

The inscription on the back of the altar \" Volanti vivas,\" is supposed by Camden to contain a wish from the inhabitants of the station, that their benefactor might live at Volantium, which he thence conjectured to be its name. Gruter to whom Camden sent this inscription, considered Volanti to be the name of a person ; and Horsley produces two examples of vivas used in the same manner in ancient inscriptions ; Mr. Gough produces a third from Gales' MSS., \" Cureti vivas.\" At the four corners of this altar are pillars, two wreathed and two fluted; and the upper part of the front is ornamented with sculptures in bas-relief of fruit, foliage, and two heads, which have been represented in the works of Camden and Horsley as suns ', but which appear rather to have been designed for lions' heads. On the other three sides are sacrificing instruments sculptured in bas-relief. No. 64 is inscribed on a stone 3 feet 4 inches high, and 10! inches wide; in very well formed letters, sharply cut, which was found a few years since at Ellenborough. This inscription contains nothing more than the names of two of the divinities, \" Roma \u00c6terna and Fortuna redux\" which occur in the large altar, (No. 63.) found at the same place.

It was first published in 1600 by Camden, who adds a fifth line A. A. (Augustorum,) and conjectures that the Emperors might have been Arcadius and Honorius. Horsley who afterwards published a figure of this tablet in his Britannia Romana, thinks it more probable that they were Diocletian and Maximian, to whom the title of Domini nostri is more frequently given than to any others '.

In eight of the altars this goddess is represented with a dog by her side, in five without it ; in all of them with a basket of fruit by her side or in her lap, or both. In one she holds the fruit in her lap without a basket, exactly as in the Netherby bas-relief; in three she is represented standing, in all the others in a sitting posture. On the sides of two of these altars were figures of Hercules, and of Neptune on four of them. Another altar with the same figure as No. 72, but with out any inscription, was found al Castlesteads, and is now in the possession of Miss Carlyle, having been in the collection of her father, the late Pro fessor Carlyle ; on the opposite side is a female figure, holding a patera in her right hand, and a Cornucopia in her left. A third fragment with this figure was found at Carlisle, in 1787, and communicated to the Society of Antiquaries in 1790, by Hayman Rooke, Esq. \u25a0 The inscription No. 73 was on a tablet of stone found not long before it was published by Horsley in 1732, near the station of Old Penrith at \u25a0 Vredius supposes the Goddess Nehalennia to be no other than Nova Luna and the name to have been a corruption of those words, or of the synonimous Greek ones \u00bb/\u00ab cAn'wi (for o-tAiim).

We do not find the name either of Cupitianus or Pitianus in the works of Gruter, Muratori, or Reynesius, but we have Cupita. Horsley also considers the monogram, (resembling the Lombardic capital E reversed) which follows the name, as intended only to fill up the space ; but this seems very improbable, and we should rather suppose that it was designed to indicate Centurio, being so used in several inscriptions : having omitted this, he reads, p.p.

Various conjectures have been formed respecting the first line \" Gaduno.\" Burton makes Gadunus a local deity. Horsley considers the inscription as sepul chral, and Gadunus to be the name of a person deceased, for whom Ulpius Trqjanus Martius, an emeritus of the Ala Petriana took care to have this funeral monument executed q. Mr. Ward supposes Emeritus to have been the name of the deceased person, and reads the inscription \" Gaduno Ulpio Trajano Emerito al\u0153 Petrian\u0153 Martius /rater ponendum curavit.\" So many errors are to be discovered in the inscriptions printed in Camden, where the originals can still be resorted to, that it is by no means improbable but the first line might contain part of the name, or some epithet of a deity very different from \" Gadunus,\" which does not sound like a Roman name, according to Horsley's reading ; or a Pr\u0153nomcn according to Mr. Ward's. From the imperfect inscription, No. 78, found at Netherby, we learn that a ruinous temple (\" Templum nimia vetestate conlab.sum\" for conlapsum), was restored to its former state in the time of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian. The name of the person by whose orders, or at whose ex pence it was done, is too imperfect to be ascertained.

An imperfect copy of it was first published by Camden in the year 1 607 in the enlarged edition of his Britannia ; it was afterwards more cor rectly given in the Appendix to Gordon's Itinerary ; and by Horsley, who appears to have taken great pains in the investigation of it. He reads it thus, \" Vexillatio legionis secund\u0153 oh [virtutem] appcllat\u0153 sub Agricola optione \u2014 Apro el Maximo Consulibus \u2014 Mercatius [filius] Fermii.\" The vexillation mentioned in this inscription had no doubt been em ployed in procuring stone from these rocks for the wall of Severus ; Aper and Maximus were consuls, A.D. 207, in the reign of that Emperor, in which year the wall was begun ; Mr. Horsley supposes that the numerals IX. and X. cut higher on the rock were intended to express the ninth and tenth cohorts of the Legio Secunda Augusta, who were employed in this quarry, and about the wall in these parts ; and might have been employed by themselves, before or after the whole vexillation was engaged in the work. The words qfficium Romanorum in a more modern hand, which appear near this inscription in Camden's copy, were not to be traced in Horsley's time : and much of what seems to have been distinct when he copied it, is now either defaced or obscured. He says that he enquired after the inscriptions said to have been upon Leuge Cragge, near Naworth, but was told that they were entirely defaced : probably this was the same spot, where we saw the remains of an inscription, (No. 84.) on a rock, which we were told was called Comb-Crag.

The successes beyond the wall in comme moration of which this memorial was erected, might have been those which took place in the reign of Antoninus Pius, previously to the raising of the vallum in Scotland between the Forth and Clyde.

This inscription on a stone found in the remains of a hypo canst at Castlesteads or Cambeck fort, was sent by Lord William Howard to Camden, and published by him in 1607 in the enlarged edition of his Britannia.

No. 97 was found in the Roman station at Burdoswald about the year 1 802 ; we saw it at that place in the year 1808, and afterwards in 1813 in the j>os session of the Bishop of Chester, in the garden of his prebendal house at Carlisle. The inscription is rather slightly cut, and appears to have been somewhat injured by exposure in the open air. We have been favoured by Mr. John Norman of Kirk- Andrews on Eden, with a copy he took of it soon after it was discovered. It appears to have been intended to commemorate some operations of the first \u00c6lian cohort of the Dacians so long quartered at this station ; but we have not been so fortunate as to ascertain the true reading of the first part, which most probably alludes to certain portions of the wall, or of the station. The fragment of an inscription found at Moresby, (No. 98.) and pre served by Camden, is quite unintelligible for want of the beginning.

It appears to have been executed in the same vear as No. 23, (A.D. 241.) when the Emperor Gordian III. and Pompeianus were consuls. 1 From a passage in Buchanan's History of the Kings of Scotland, lib. v. it appears that a legate of this name obtained great successes over the Picts in the reign of the Emperor Gratian, but the form of the letters in this inscription is too good to admit of the conjecture that he was one of the persons there mentioned. u A sac-simile of it is shewn in the plate of inscribed stones, p. clxiii. 1 1 The"], [212, "CUMBERLAND. clxxxii The inscription No. ioo is on a stone, in the wall of a house at Howgill near Walton.

Hayman Rooke, Esquire, by whom this inscription was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries in the year 1789, supposes that as Pussitta does not sound like a Roman name it may have been intended for posita : it seems much more probable that the workman may have committed an error in cutting the name ; and that it may have been intended for Pusilla, a name which occurs in Gruter.

A plan of several hypocausts and other rooms, pro bably part of the baths for the use of the station, discovered at Netherby in the years 1732 and 1745, was published in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1750, and afterwards in the Philosophical Transactions. y A fibula of gold was found at the station called Old-Penrith, near Plumpton-Wall, which we saw in the year 1801 in the possession of Mr. Sanderson of that place; it weighs 14 pennyweights and 18 grains; on one side are figures of gryphons, on the other of bears, which are in- dented, and appear to have been filled up with enamel : both sides of this fibula are shewn in the annexed Plate, fig. 5 and 6, and on an enlaro-ed scale in fig. 7 and 8. In the autumn of 18 13, five altars were found in the same place, each of which was two feet in height and seventeen inches in width, without any inscriptions, each of them containing the image of a deity within a niche in rather high relief, several parts of which were evidently unfinished. The figures are those of Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, all clearly to be ascertained by their respective symbols. They appear to have been left in an unfinished state, whence it might be supposed that they were executed near the time of the Romans quitting this island, though the execution of them is superior to what we see in most of the Roman works which have been discovered in the northern counties.

Saxon. \u2014 Remains of Saxon architecture are to be seen in many of the churches of Cumberland, though few of them are entitled to any particular notice, except those in the nave and south transept of Carlisle cathedral, and in the churches of Aspatria and Torpenhow. The style of the first, which is most probably part of the building erected by William Rufus, is plain and massy ; a specimen of this is exhibited in the annexed Plate. In Aspatria church, the great arch and the south door-way are richly orna mented with braids and chevron mouldings ; and some of the original small round-headed windows are to be seen in the north wall of the nave and of the belfry. The great arch in Torpenhow church is enriched with chevron mouldings ; the capitals of the half pillars on each side are remarkably ornamented, one of the sides being formed by an assemblage of grotesque heads, the other by human figure., with interlaced arms. The great arches and the door-ways of Bridekirk, Irthington, Isell, and Kirkbampton churches are in the same style, but less ornamented ; within the arch of the north door-way of the last, there is a rudely-sculptured bas-relief, representing two animals and what seems to have been designed for an abbot. Kirklinton is a very complete Saxon church, having undergone no alter ation. The nave is a parallelogram of 30 feet by 18 feet 6 inches; the chancel, of 32 feet by 14 feet 6 inches. The great arch is ornamented with chevron mouldings. Warwick Church is in the plain Saxon style: the east end terminates in a semicircle, where are thirteen narrow round-headed niches in some of which are very small windows. z The great west door of the church of St. Bees is ornamented with gro tesque heads and chevron mouldings ; and door-ways with circular arches and Saxon ornaments remain in the churches of Bromefield, Burgh on the Sands, Dearham, Edenhall, Grinsdale, and Great-Salkeld. z There is a figure of this Church in Pennant's tour in Scotland, vol.i. pl.iv. p. 60.

CXC Early Gothic. \u2014 The remains of Holme-Cultram Abbey and of Lanercost Priory churches, exhibit specimens of the earliest Gothic architecture, of the middle and latter part of the twelfth century, having the pointed arch united to the massy pillars of the preceding style. Of Holme-Cultram abbey, which was founded in the year 1 1 50, great part of the nave remains, now used as the parish church ; the great west door has four small pillars on each side, and the arch is inriched with numerous plain mouldings. Laner cost Priory was founded in the year 1 1 69 ; and there is every reason to conclude that the whole of the choir and transepts, now in ruins, and the lower part of the nave, at present used as the parish church, are parts of the original edifice. Specimens of these are shewn in the annexed Plates. Thirteenth Century. \u2014 The west end of Lanercost Priory church, the east end of that of St. Bees, now in ruins, and the aisles of the choir of Carlisle cathedral, are in the style of the early Gothic, with lancet-shaped windows and slender shafts between them : the east end of Egremont church, and what remains of that of Seton Priory, are in this style. The large clustered pillars in the choir of Carlisle cathedral, the capitals of which are much enriched with sculptured foliage, and the pointed arches with a great va riety of mouldings, are in the style of the latter part of this century. Fourteenth Century. \u2014 There are few remains of the ecclesiastical archi tecture of this century in Cumberland, except the upper part of the choir of Carlisle cathedral and the east end, the elevation of which is shewn in the annexed Plate. This part of the church having been destroyed by fire, at the close of the preceding century, is said to have been rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III. The destruction does not appear to have extended to any great part of the building except the roof, for nearly the whole of the choir and north transept still existing are of an earlier age, as already noticed. At the east end of the south aisle of Brigham church is a handsome window in the style of this century. Sixteenth Century. \u2014 The only specimen of the latest Gothic architecture which we observed in this county, occurs at the west end of Holme- Abbey church, where there are two niches, the arches and pinnacles of which are much enriched with crockets, &c. with inscriptions in text hand*, from which it appears that the image of the Virgin Mary formerly stood in one of them, and that the work was executed in the year 1 507, when Robert z \" Robertus Chamber fecit Jieri hoc opus A\" Dom.

C. a Border Churches. \u2014 There are some remarkable ecclesiastical edifices in the county of Cumberland on the borders of Scotland, which, as they lie out of the ordinary route of travellers, have been little noticed. The towers of two of these, Newton- Arlosh church, near the western coast, and Burgh on the Sands, near the Solway Frith, appear to have been very strong, and capable of affording protection to the inhabitants of the villages, for some time, upon any sudden invasion from the opposite coast across the Frith ; the cattle were probably secured in the body of the church. Newton- Arlosh church was built soon after 1303. b On the ground floor in the tower is a vaulted chamber 13 feet square, with a small aperture, 18 inches high and 9 inches wide, on the west side; over this was a chamber nearly of the same dimensions, with three narrow win dows or rather arrow-slits on the north, south, and west sides: it had a fire place on the south side ; and a passage through the wall at the north-west corner, leading to a larger opening. The chamber on the upper story is of the same dimensions, nearly resembling that on the first floor, except that it has a fourth window, on the east side, and no fire-place c. There is a stone staircase in the south-east angle of the tower, leading to the upper chambers. So great has been the attention paid to security, in the con struction of this edifice, that the principal window at the east end, over the altar, is only eleven inches in width. The tower of the church of Burgh on the Sands is still more strongly fortified d, the walls on three sides being from six to seven feet thick : the vaulted chamber on the ground-floor is only ten feet by eight, and the entrance to it from the church is secured by a ponderous iron door, six feet eight inches in height, with two large bolts, exactly resembling one remaining at Naworth Castle. On the north side of the chamber is a very narrow opening or arrow-slit, at the end of a recess in the wall six feet a The same device appears on an ancient bench at Netherhall brought from this abbey, on which is inscribed, in raised letters in text hand, \" Of Robert Chambers and his brethren.\" b See p. 115. c See a view and plans and a section of this church in the annexed Plates. \" The church of Annan in Scotland, on the opposite side of the Solway Frith, appears to have been as strongly fortiBed ; the town was defended by the Scots in the year 1547 for some time against the Earl of Lennox and the Lord Wharton, but at length surrendered to the English, by whom it was destroyed.

CXCII three inches deep ; and on the west side are two such openings, (one of them only three inches wide) with steps leading up to them. At the south west angle is a stone staircase, leading to the upper chamber, the dimensions of which are 10 feet 9! inches by 11 feet y\\ inches : on the east side of the room is an opening into the upper part of the nave of the church, and on the south and west sides are small narrow windows. This tower was probably built in the reign of King Edward I. Many hewn stones appear in different parts of the building with the exterior surface hatched, evidently taken from the wall of Severus, or the station of Alexolodunum, which was at this place, about 200 yards east of the church. The tower of Great-Salkeld church was also strongly fortified'; at the entrance from the nave is a massy grated iron door, lined with oak ; the chamber on the ground-floor is vaulted like those of Burgh on the Sands and Newton- Arlosh. In the chamber on the first floor there is a fire-place; over this chamber have been two others, with floors of timber. Fainted Glass. \u2014 Very few remains of ancient painted glass are to be seen in any of the Cumberland churches : when we visited this county in the year 1808, we observed in a north window of the chancel of Edenhall church, figures of the Virgin and Child, and of a Saint in the habit of a Bishop, holding a King's head in his left hand, an outline of which is introduced in the margin. This is supposed to have been intended for St. Aidan, Bishop of Lindisfarn, carrying the head of Oswald, King of Northumberland. We learn that this figure has been since taken away from the church. Under the figure of the Virgin were portraits of a lady kneeling, with four others behind her. In a north window of Cross thwaite church we observed the upper part of a figure of St. Anthony, holding a book in his right hand, and a bell in his left. The east window of Greystock church appears to have been richly ornamented with historical subjects, relating to St. Andrew, in eight compartments, now e It is probable that this church was fortified about the same time that Penrith castle was fortified by the Nevils ; the village being frequently exposed to the invasion of the Scots, on account of the King of Scotland's claim to the manor.

Stofie Stalls, \u00a7c. \u2014 At Brigham, in the south wall of the south aisle, are three stone stalls, and a piscina enriched with crockets ; and the same num ber of stalls in Greystoke and Ousby churches, the former with plain pointed arches and detached pillars, in the style of the early Gothic ; the latter with trefoil arches. Fonts. \u2014 The font best entitled to notice in this county, and probably the most curious one in the kingdom, is that in Bridekirk church, the four sides of which are exhibited in the annexed Plates. They are all enriched with sculptures in bas-relief, the style of which would clearly indicate it to be the work of an earlier age than that of the Norman conquest, if it had not the Dano-Saxon inscription on the south side, in Runic characters ; which was first satisfactorily explained by Bishop Nicolson, in a letter to Sir Wil liam Dugdale, published in the fifteenth volume of the Philosophical Trans actions. He reads it thus, \" Er Ekard han men egrocten. and to dis men red veer Taner men brogton ;\" i. e. \" Here Ekard was converted, and to this man's example were the Danes brought.\" The scroll on which this inscription is cut rests on two pillars, one of which is evidently clustered, and of a lighter style than that which prevailed a short time before the Conquest. On the south side of the font, immediately over the inscription, is a scroll of vine-branches, proceeding from a grotesque head ; with the figure of a man at the opposite end, eating one of the bunches of grapes : beneath it is introduced the figure of a sculptor, with his mallet and chisel, executing a scroll. In the upper part of this and the north and east sides, are intro duced various grotesque animals and foliage, with a sort of cross floree on the west side. The east side has a representation of the baptism of our Saviour by John the Baptist, with the dove descending. On the west side is a circular ornament, supported by two grotesque animals, within a border of foliage, which frequently occurs on the Saxon fonts. The sculpture on the lower part of the north side has been supposed to represent the Angel driving Adam and Eve out of Paradise ; but though this subject is to be seen in the sculptured decorations of some ancient fonts, it is difficult to imagine that it was intended to be represented here, Vol. IV. b b as"], [252, "cxciv CUMBERLAND. as the costume of the three figures, by no means accords with that subject, as we see it expressed in ancient works of art. Camden says that this font was found in the Roman station at Papcastle, but this is doubted by Bishop Lyttelton f, as there had never been a church or chapel there ; his Lordship supposes the font to have been of higher antiquity, and that the inscription was added about the beginning of the eleventh century, under the Danish government. But this is very im probable, as the scroll which contains the inscription, is evidently part of the original design. If the font was really found at Papcastle, according to the tradition, it must have been in the chapel of the castle belonging to the Saxon lords of Allerdale, which is not very probable : it is much more likely that it should have been a donation to the church, where it remains, by Ekard, who had embraced Christianity, and who no doubt was a person of consequence. There are several other fonts in the churches of Cumberland which may be referred to the Saxon times ; the most remarkable of these, which are all of a square form, are, the old one at Bowness s, and those in the churches of Aspatria and Cross-Canonby, and of Dearham, the four sides of which are represented in the annexed Plate. The font in Bootle church is octagonal, with two shields on each side ; one of them contains a bugle horn and the initials J. H. in text hand : an inscription in text hand, \" In nomine patris &; jilii,\" &c. is continued through several others. Ancient Sepidchral Monuments. \u2014 The churches and church-yards in Cumberland abound with ancient grave-stones, some of which, from the form of the letters inscribed on them, may be referred to a very early period. Over one of the windows on the south side of the nave of Dearham church, is a grave-stone, with a cross-floree and sword, having the words \" Kestida Radulp . .\" (Cestula Radidphi, the coffin of Radulphus,) cut on it, in very uncouth characters \\ In the church-yard of Irthington is a grave-stone f Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. ii. p. 131. s When we saw it in 1808, it was lying in a garden near the church. b See the annexed Plate, fig. 3. This inscription was communicated by the vicar of Dearham lo Mr. G. Smith, as being in the tvmdoiv of his church, and was inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1751, p. 112. The late Mr. Pegge, under his usual signature of Paul Gemsege, afterwards communicated his conjectures on it to the same Magazine, (p. 254). Supposing it to have been on the glass, and to have related to some repairs of the church-windows, with no small degree of ingenuity, he conjectured that it should be read \" Hasjenestras Galfridus Gudng reparavit Ano Domini MCL.\" with"], [253, "''he- four Sides of the Fact in Deaths m Cbtorcb n&hfudb) t.cmub"], [254, ""], [255, "tuMutud fy reutu a \u00ab ujrt ANCIENT GRATE-STONES IN C UMBE 1LAND . l.InAspa&za t////ret/ Yiirtt.

The most curious and perfect of these is the obelisk at Bewcastle, which was first noticed by Camden, has been frequently described ; and several very inaccurate figures of it have been published. It is of one stone, 14 feet 6 inches high, _o\u00a7 inches in width at the bottom, and 14! inches at the top on the north and south sides ; and 22 inches at the bottom, and 16 at the top, on the east and west sides. At the top is a socket 8'f by 7! inches, in which no doubt a cross has formerly been fixed.

Immediately over this figure are the remains of an inscription in Runic characters, of which an accurate sac-simile was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by Henry Howard, Esq. of Corby x : this was so much decayed, more than a century ago, that Bishop Nicolson declined attempting to make out any part of it \\ Over this is another figure sculptured in bas-relief, wdrich, from the nimbus round the head, has been supposed to represent some saint ; but as he holds a roll (the sacred volumeii) in his left hand, and the right hand is elevated in the act of benediction, we should rather suppose it was in- tended for our Saviour, who is frequently so represented in ancient works of art. Immediately above this figure are some taint traces of another inscription of two fines ; and over this, a third sculpture in bas-relief, which is described by Bishop Nicolson as \" the effigies of the B. V. with the Babe in her arms, and both their heads encircled with glories.\" This description, which several succeeding writers appear to have copied, without inspecting the original, is very erroneous. The female figure is so defaced that nothing more than the general outline can be distinguished ; what she holds in her left arm is much better preserved, and is evidently the holy lamb. The east side is filled with an elegant scroll ornamented with fblLge, fruit, flowers, and animals, sculptured in bas-relief, as are five compartments, of flowers and Runic knots, placed alternately, on the south side : in the uppermost but one is a sun-dial. On the north side are also five compart- ments ; two of flowers, two of knots, and the fifth filled with chequer- work, which led some of our early antiquaries into the extraordinary supposition that it was erected by one of the family of Vaux, which bore chequy for their arms \\ Immediately above the lowest compartment on this side, is a pretty perfect inscription in Runic characters, in one line; which Bishop Nicolson reads \" Rynburn,\" and supposes that it signifies \" the final extir pation and burial of the magical Run\u00e6 in these^parts, upon the conversion of the Danes to the Christian faith ; or Ryeeburn, which he took to signify in the old Danish language, c\u0153miterium, or cadaverum sepulchrum.

In Arthuret church-yard is a plain obelisk of stone, with a cross like that of the Knights-Templars, cut on the upper part of it in bas-relief. In the church-yard at Penrith are two pillars, one of which is ten feet eight inches high, the other about six inches higher, standing about fifteen feet asunder ; the upper part of each is ornamented with various knots and braids, now nearly effaced : each of them is mortised into a flat round stone. Between them are four large stones, which appear to have been originally semicircular, two of which are- plain ; on the others are several ornaments, and evident remains of some figures rudely sculptured in bas-relief: in a favourable light we could clearly distinguish that of a large serpent and two human figures, one of them apparently a child : and we observe that Sir William Dugdale has expressed them thus, in a drawing of this subject, which he has inserted in his Visitation of Cumberland, preserved in the Heralds' College. This curious monument is commonly called the Giant's Grave, r id there is great reason to suppose that it was sepulchral: at no great distance from it is another stone, called The Giant's thumb, which ap pears to have been a cross, (like those in Cornwall with four holes) from which the upper part has been broken off.

It appears, from an entry in the hand-writing of Lord William Howard, in the chartu lary of Lanercost Priory', that this cross was dug up in his time in the green before the church ; and that the inscription, then entire, was as follows, \" Anno ab incaratione MCCXIIII et VII anno interdict, optimente sedem Apocam Innocent III.

Ancient Castles.']\u2014 Of Egremont-Castle, which was built by Willam de Meschines, soon after the Conquest, little at present remains, except the \" See the annexed Plate, fig. 2. e In the possession of the Earl of Carlisle, r> gateway,"], [283, ""], [284, "ItvtdmSftjhUrhed jJpril z4jBi6 Sty I CadeB k IVJjinicf Stmpd"], [285, "0 CUMBERLAND. cciii gateway, with a plain semicircular arch, having a square tower over it : and a piece of wall, in which are two pointed windows of a later date. The herring-bone masonry in the lower part of the wall on the outside of the ruins, indicates its antiquity. A south-west view of these remains was pub lished by Buck in 1739, the present state of them will be seeL by the an nexed view. The castle of Carlisle, which stands at the North-west angle of the city, is of an irregular form; consisting of two wards; the outer one, two sides of which are formed by the city wall, in shape approaches to a square, and contains no building of any consequence : the inner ward is triangular, its principal building is the keep or dungeon tower, which is square and very ancient, being apparently part of the original edifice erected by King William Rufus. The lower part of the tower at the north-east angle of the castle, seems to be of the same age, having on the north-side, a semicircular arch. The other parts of the castle are of much more recent date, considerable addi tions and repairs having been made in the reigns of King Richard III, Henry VIII, and Queen Elizabeth. A north-west view of this castle was published by Buck in 1739 ; it is probable that the drawing in the British Museum, from which the annexed plan was engraved, might have been made in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Cockermouth-Castle was probably dismantled in the civil war or suffered to go to decay soon afterwards. The walls, which in form approach to a square, are flanked by one round tower and several square ones. The greater part of the building does not appear to be older than the fourteenth century, though it has been referred to a much earlier period. It consists of two courts, the first a very small one ; on each side of the gateway be tween them is a deep vaulted dungeon : in the principal court is a building called the kitchen, under which is a vaulted chamber, with a roof supported by a single pillar, said to have been a chapel ' ; but we did not perceive any thing to indicate that it had been so, except the name of the Murk-kirk, by which it is at present called. A north-west view of this castle was published by Buck *\" in 1739. The castle which stands within the site of the Roman station at Bewcastle, is a plain square building or tower, without any turrets or projections, and apparently of great antiquity ; but nothing certain is known as to the builder of it, or at what time it was erected. f Grose's Antiq.

CCIV Naworth-Castle, which is in a very perfect state, and occasionally inha bited by its owner, the Earl of Carlisle, appears to have been erected soon after the ninth year of King Edward III, when Ralph Lord Dacre obtained the King's licence to castellate his mansion of Naworth. Much of the building is in the style of the early part of the sixteenth century ; and it underwent considerable repairs, when it was fitted up for the residence of Lord William Howard at the close of that century. It is built round a court of an irregular form, approaching to a square h, adapted to the preci pitous banks of the river Irthing, on which it stands : the apartments are not large, except the hall on the east side, which was originally i oo feet in length, and 24 in width ; it is now only 70 feet long, a part having been taken off to make a dining-room. The ceiling of the hall is ornamented with heads of the Kings of England, from the Saxon times to the union of the houses of York and Lancaster, coarsely painted on pannels, which are said to have been brought from Kirk-Oswald Castle, at the time of its de molition '. The chapel, which is on the south side of the court, is forty-four feet, three inches long, and twenty-four feet, nine inches wide, the ceiling and east end are ornamented with paintings in pannels, in the same style as those in the hall, and apparently by ihe same hand : on the ceiling is the root of Jesse, represented as we frequently see it in painted glass, by the re cumbent figure of an old man, from whom proceeds a branch, bearing the heads of Kings and Patriarchs, his descendants: under the figure is the name of the painter, which we could not clearly distinguish, and the date of 1512. At the south-east angle of the castle, is a tower, evidently part of the original edifice, the upper part of which contains the private apart ment of Lord William Howard, who resided here in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and King James the First ; consisting of a library, a chapel, and a bed-chamber, all of very small dimensions; the entrance to which is by a very strong door, well secured with iron grating and bolts ; the ap proach to it is through a gallery at the top of the castle, on the south side, one hundred and six feet six inches in length, and nine feet two inches wide. The chapel or oratory was originally fitted up with plain wainscot, painted of a red colour and ornamented with the armorial devices of the Dacre family ; besides which, a great abundance of fragments of ornaments sculp tured in wood, painted and gilt ; including the arms of Dacre and Grey stock apparently the ruins of a rich screen, (probably that of the Rood loft from the adjacent priory church of Lanercost,) are fixed up round the h See the plan in the annexed plate.

Greystoke-castle was probably built soon after the year 1353, when William de Greystoke had the King's licence for castellating his manor house. Only one large square tower of the ancient edifice now remains, which is connected with the modern mansion house, erected on its site. q Ancient Mansion Houses.^] \u2014 There are few ancient mansion houses in this county independently of the castles, which contain any thing remark able, or worthy of particular notice, except the large square tower, of three or four stories, which was attached to most of them, with walls of great thickness ; intended for the retreat and defence of the family, upon any sudden predatory incursion of the Scots. The chamber on the ground-floor was vaulted, and the entrance secured by a strong grated iron door. These towers are to be seen at Muncaster, Irton-hall, Netherby, Nether-hall, and several other mansion houses, at present occupied by the gentry of the county, though frequently almost hidden by modern alter ations. One of them stands detached from any other building, at Kirk- Andrews-upon-Eske : this, which is quite entire, has a projecting parapet resting on brackets, and indented gable ends, in the style of the ancient buildings in the neighbouring part of Scotland : at one corner is a stone stair-case ; the dimensions of this tower are twenty-eight feet by thirty-seven feet six inches.

Miscellaneous Antiquities.\"] \u2014 There are several antiquities in Cumberland, which could not be referred to any of the foregoing heads, of which the following are the most remarkable. Wetheral Safeguard, or Constantine's Cells, consisting of three chambers cut out of a rock, at the height of forty feet above the summer level of the river Eden, with a gallery in front communicating with each. The most probable conjecture which has been formed on the subject of these cells, is, that they served for the retreat of the monks of the adjacent monastery of Wetheral, during the incursions of the Scots : a particular account of them, with a plan, was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries in the year 1755, and published in the Ar ch\u00e6ologia. There is a singular vaulted chamber, attached to and within the wall of the city of Carlisle, between the citadel and the deanery ; the only access to which is by an opening broken through the wall : and it does not appear that it had originally any entrance : at each end is a recess. A circular funnel of neatly wrought stone-work rises on one side to the level of the ground, where it is covered by a large flat stone ; another funnel of a form nearly square, extends from the middle of the arch horizontally to a con siderable length inwards s. It is difficult to conceive for what purpose this building was designed, unless it was intended tor holding water ; which the position and construction of the funnels seem to indicate. If the arch of the vault, which is slightly pointed, had been circular, we should have sup posed that this was the \" fontem miro quondam Romanoi-um opere exstruc \" turn;\" which the citizens of Carlisle shewed St. Cuthbert in the year 685, as recorded by Bede. At the back of the stalls in the choir of Carlisle cathedral is the Belief in Latin, in the text hand of the fourteenth century, and very rude paintings of the apostles ; with a great number of paintings in compartments, repre senting seventeen different subjects from the legend of St. Anthony, the same number from that of St. Austin ; and twenty-two from that of St. Cuthbert : with two explanatory English verses under each in text-hand. At the four corners of Dacre church-yard are rude figures of animals, five feet high, sitting on their haunches, and clasping a rude pillar or ' See the plan and sections in the annexed plate. ragged"], [292, "CUMBERLAND. CCIX ragged staff; they seem to have been designed for bears, though they do not much resemble them, or indeed any other animals. It has been supposed that they refer to some armorial device of the Dacre family, as the ragged staff appears connected with the escallop shell, in several of the ornaments of Naworth castle ; though we do not find it any where recorded among the arms or cognizances of that family. A Saxon ornament of silver, enriched with red paste, a representation of which is exhibited in the annexed plate, was found a few years since at Kirk-Oswald', with more than 700 of the small Saxon copper coins called sticas ; among which were one of Archbishop Eanbald, fifty-eight of Arch bishop Vigmund, and five of Archbishop Vulfhere u : ninety-nine of King Eanred, three hundred and fifty of King Ethelred, fourteen of King Redulf, and fifteen of King Osbercht. A very remarkable silver broach of extraordinary size, the ring being about seven inches in diameter, and the tongue twenty-two inches in length ;. weighing twenty -five ounces, was found in the year 1785 in a field near Fluskew-pike, in the parish of Dacre. The most probable conjecture re specting it, is, that it was used for fastening a tent x. A fibula of silver was found in the mud of a fish-pond in Brayton park, and a silver hook weighing two ounces. y A small brass kettle, with two handles, standing on three legs, in form ex actly resembling the iron ones still in use, was found, a few years since, at the Roman station on Eskmeals, in the parish of 1 r; \u2014 Ravenglass, and is now in the possession of 1 _Y~^v Y E.

From the style of the ornaments, it seems to be of as early an age as the beginning of the fifteenth century, probably earlier. At Muncaster Castle is also preserved an ancient glass vessel of the basin kind, about seven inches in diameter, ornamented with some white enamelled mouldings ; which, according to family tradition, was presented to Sir John Pennington by King Henry VI. Customs. Several remarkable customs formerly prevailed in this county, some of which still continue. In the parish of Muncaster it is said that the children go from house to house on New Year's Eve, singing a ditty, which craves the bounty \" they were wont to have in old King Edward's days3.\" And on Newr Year's Day, in many places of this and the adjoining county of Westmorland, the common people assemble together, carrying stangs (polls) and baskets, and hoist up any man who refuses to join them, on the poll ; or woman on the basket; carrying them to the next public house, where the payment of a small fine liberates the prisoner\". On Easter Eve, in some parts of the county, the boys and beggars ask for eggs c. In Cumwhitton they hold the wake on St. John's Eve, with lighting fires (the bel-tien) dancing &c.\" Mr. Pennant says, that the bel-tien superstition was kept up till of late years, in the neighbourhood of Keswick, and that in this rural sacrifice, it was customary for the performers to bring with them boughs of the moun tain ash e.

A history of this county and of Westmorland, was published in 1777, in two volumes quarto, by Joseph Nicolson, Esq. of Hawksdale, and Richard Burn, LL. D. chancellor of the diocese, and author of those well known and useful works, \" The Justice of Peace,\" and \" Ecclesiastical Laws.\" The chief sources from which these writers compiled their work, were the collections of Mr. Nicolson's uncle, Dr. William Nicolson, Bishop of Car lisle, the learned author of \" The Historical Library,\" a MS. sketch of a history of Cumberland, by Mr. John Denton of Cardew ; a MS. history of Cumberland, by Mr. Sandford ; Bishop Gastrell's Notitia Cestriensis ; and the collections of the Rev. Thomas Machell, which had been digested by Bishop Nicolson, and are now in the dean and chapter's library at Carlisle. Dr. Burn, from his situation, was peculiarly well qualified to give an accurate account of the ecclesiastical history of the county. In the year 1794 Mr. William Hutchinson, F. S. A. in conjunction with his printer, Mr. Fr. Jollie, published a new history of the county of Cum berland, in two Aolumes in quarto. The additions bring it down to the month of July 1797. In this work the parishes of Bromfield, tSebergham, and Caldbeck, were written by the late Rev. Jonathan Boucher, a native of Blencogo, in the first mentioned parish, who communicated also the biographical notices. The accounts of the several manors, drawn up by Denton, with the ad ditions of William Gilpin, Esq. of Scaleby, and William Milbourne, Esq. of Armathwaite, are given as quotations, instead of being incorporated as in Nicolson and Burn's history, in their text. One of the chief features of Hutchinson's history, is the insertion of statistical notes to each parish, from Houseman's collections, and the communications of the clergy. The account of the descent of property in Nicolson and Burn's history, which appears to be in general very satisfactory, is not given solely from the MS. of Mr. John Denton, which seems to be a mere sketch, containing the descent of about 130 manors, not methodized into any order, or arranged under parishes. Mr. Machell, from whose MSS. they derived a great part of their materials, had made large collections from the records in the tower, the rolls-chapel, and other public depositories. Vol. IV. B In"], [298, "CUMBERLAND. 2 In our own brief accounts of the descent of property, we have chiefly relied on Nicolson and Burn ; some additional information, as occasionally quoted, has been derived from the tower records, and from a MS. history of the county, by Thomas Denton, Esq. obligingly lent us by the Earl of Lons- dale, to whose assistance, in various particulars, we have been much indebted during our inquiries relating to this county. In all instances the descent of property has been brought down to the present time. Neither Nicolson and Burn, nor Hutchinson, seem to have been aware of the existence of a MS. history of Cumberland by Mr. T. Denton ; the former probably had seen some extracts from this MS., a fewr passages being occasionally quoted from it, but it cannot be supposed that they had seen the whole, as several manors are described by him, which they have left unnoticed, and there are many other particulars which no writer of a history of Cumberland having seen, could be supposed to have purposely omitted. Hutchinson speaking of John Denton's MS. says, \" the original we are informed is in the possession of the Earl of Lonsdale.\" This information no doubt alluded to Mr. T. Den- ton's MS. The other MS. is attributed by Nicolson and Burn, to John Denton, Esq. of Cardew, who lived in the reign of James the First, and we suppose they had good authority for so doing ; but we have in our possession two copies of this MS. (of which it is said there are several) one lent us by the Earl of Lonsdale, the other by William Browne, Esq. of Tallentire Hall, in neither of which is there any thing to denote the author. It appears to have been written while Henry Robinson was Bishop of Carlisle, and the writer has afterwards added the name of Robert Snowden, who became his successor in 1616. The MS. consists of a very brief description of the county, and the descent of the baronies and nearly 130 manors, not arranged in any order3. The other MS. was written in the years 1687 an& 1688, by Thomas Denton, Esq. barrister at law, recorder of Carlisle, and lord of the manor of Warnell Hall in Sebergham b. It is drawn up methodically as for publication, with a dedication to Sir John Lowther, Bart, but it is expressed in the dedication, that it was intended only for his patron's \" private satis faction.\" It contains a description of the county ; its division and juris diction ; a list of the parishes and townships ; the franchises ; forests ; prin cipal hills ; rivers ; bridges ; markets ; fairs ; boroughs ; religious houses ; eastles ; noblemen's seats ; houses of baronets ; free-schools ; hospitals ; and \" The account of John Denton's MS. in Mr. Gough's British Topography, would better apply to Mr. T.

All this is intro ductory to a parochial history of the county, arranged by wards ; with the history and extent of the several baronies ; the boundaries of each parish, the number of inhabitants, the descent of manors and other principal estates ; the tenures and value of each ; notes relating to families ; an account of the benefices, &c. &c. It is evident that the writer had seen the MS. attributed to John Denton, from which he has copied much of the ancient account of such manors as are there treated of, but he makes no mention of it, or, of his relation John Denton of Cardew, having been a collector. The account of all the estates is brought down to 1688, and the description of the then state of Cumberland, appears to have been the result chiefly of personal observation, and shows a thorough acquaintance with ahnost every part of the county. The Rev. Hugh Todd, one of the prebendaries of Carlisle, who had col lected materials also towards a county history, drew up an historical account of the city of Carlisle, a copy of which in MS. has been lent us by Mr. Browne of Tallentire. It is considerably more enlarged than the copy spoken of by Mr. Gough, in his British topography. The historical events (though by no means a full detail) are brought down to the time of the civil wars, and a copy of the articles of surrender in 1645, are given > there is also an account, though a very imperfect one, of the charters and of the religious foundations, and a brief description of the then existing state of the city. The sources from which we have derived the descent of property in the ensuing parochial history, have been already mentioned. The church notes and other materials were obtained during a personal visit to each parish, in the year 1808. For an account of the present state of the schools and other public endowments ; the present possessors of manors, and other modern local information, we have been indebted to the clergy of the several parishes, who have very obligingly attended to and answered our queries upon those subjects.

There is no village of Addingham : the church is in the township of Glassonby ; the vicarage-house in the township of Little-Salkeld, which is a mile and three quarters from the church. The whole parish, in 1811, contained 118 inhabited houses, and 550 inhabitants. The lordship of Glassonby and Gamelsby was given by King Henry I. to Hildred, to be holden by the annual payment of 2 s. cornage. The heiress of Odard, great-grand-daughter of the said Hildred, brought it to William de Ireby, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to Lascelles and Season. Christopher Seaton having attached himself to the party of Robert Bruce, his estates were forfeited, and the lordship of Glassonby, with other estates in Cumberland and elsewhere, given by King Edward I. to William Latimer. From the Larimers it passed by a female heir to the Nevilles. From the coheiresses of Neville it appears to have passed to the Dacres of Kirkoswald. It is now the property of Sir Philip Musgrave, Bart., having been purchased by his ancestor, Sir Christopher, of the two daughters of Thomas Lennard, Earl of Sussex, representative of the Dacres. Mr. Denton says, that Gamblesby manor, with the hamlet of Unthank annexed, continued in the Crown in 1688. They now belong to the Duke of Devonshire, having been included in the grant to the Earl of Portland.0 The manor of Little-Salkeld was confirmed by King Edward I., about the year 1292, to the prior and convent of Carlisle, having been long before given to that monastery by Walter the Norman d. Upon the reformation it was given, with other estates, to the dean and chapter, who are impropriators of the great tithes, and patrons of the vicarage. In this township is the site of an ancient castle, of the possessors of which, we find no record or memorial. Mr. Denton says that this place gave name to the ancient family of Salkeld, and that Mr. George Salkeld was obliged to part with the seat of his ancestors here for a trifling consideration, in the time of the civil war, to Colonel Cholmley, who built a large new house on the site. This house, after several alienations, became, (before the year 1688,) the property of Mr. Charles Smallwood ; it was purchased of his descendant Timothy Small wood, Esq., by Lieutenant-Colonel Lacy, the present proprietor. Colonel See the account of Penrith. Nicolson and Burn. Lacy"], [301, "CUMBERLAND. 5 Lacy rebuilt the house about the year 1790, and has much improved the estate with plantations, &c. The church of Addingham is in the diocese of Carlisle, and deanery of Allerdale. There was, in antient times, a chapel at Little-Salkeld. Dr. Paley, the celebrated theologian, was vicar of this parish from 1792 to 1795. At Maughanby in this parish is a free school, founded in 1634, by the Rev. Edward Mayplett, prebendary of Carlisle and vicar of Addingham. It was endowed with a house and 68 acres of land, now let at 80/. per annum. This estate is customary land, holden under the manor of Melmerby, and subject to a fine on the death of the lord or tenant. The schoolmaster has been for many years appointed by the bishop, the trust not having been renewed. This school is free for the whole parish. About the year 1726, Joseph Hutchinson devised the reversion of an estate at Gawtree for the support of a school for the benefit of the township of Hunsonby and Win scale. It is now let for 52/. per annum. The same Joseph Hutchinson gave an estate at Winscale, now let at 661. per annum, for the benefit of the poor of that township. Aikton, in Cumberland ward, lies five miles from Wigton and nine from Carlisle. It has four townships \u2014 Aikton ; Biglands and Gamelsby ; Wa thinpool, or Wampool ; and Wiggonby. The whole parish, in 181 1, con tained 129 inhabited houses, and 614 inhabitants. The manor of Aikton having been anciently parcel of the barony of Burgh, was brought in marriage by one of the coheiresses of Sir Hugh Morville, lord of that barony, to Sir Richard Gernon, who had his seat within this manor, at a place called Downhall. Having passed by female heirs to the families of Baliol, Colvill, Daniel, and Katcliffe, it was purchased by the Dacres, in the reign of Henry VI. and again united to the barony of Burgh. It is now the property of the Earl of Lonsdale. Downhall, near which is a moated site, is now the property of Mr. Joseph Hodgson, whose family have possessed it many years. The manor of Biglands and Gamelsby was in ancient times held under the barony of Burgh by William Brewer, and afterwards by the Crookdakes ; the coheiresses of the latter married Raughton and Boyvill. Raughton's moiety having passed successively by marriage or purchase to the families of Aspilon, Warcop, -Crakenthorp, and Denton, was sold by the latter to the several tenants. Boyvill's moiety having passed by marriage to Highmore, and by sale to Dacre, became again parcel of the barony of Burgh, now vested in the Earl of Lonsdale. The"], [302, "CUMBERLAND. 6 The manor of Wathinpool belonged to a family of that name, afterwards to the Warwicks, by whom it was sold to the several tenants. The hamlet of Leathes gave name to a family who possessed the manor till the reign of King James I., when Adam de Leathes sold it to the tenants. This family of Leathes have been long settled at Dalehead, near Keswick. The church of Aikton is a rectory in the diocese and deanery of Carlisle. The rectory was formerly in moieties, occasioned, as is supposed, by the division of the Morville estate between the coheiresses of Sir Hugh. These moieties were afterwards united, and the advowson having continued attached to the barony of Burgh, is now vested in the Earl of Lonsdale. There is a school at Aikton endowed with the interest of 30/. bequeathed by Joseph Watson, of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, in 1764; and another at Wiggonby, built and endowed with 40/. per annum, by Margaret Hodgson, about the year 1794. This school is free for all children of the name of Hodgson, and for the children of the parishes of Aikton, Burgh on Sands, and Beaumont, whose parents are not possessed of property to the amount of 20 /. per annum. There is a fund also for providing books, and for clothing some of the more indigent. Ainstable, in Leath ward, lies twelve miles from Penrith. The manor of Ainstaple was given by Hubert de Vallibus, or Vaux, lord of the barony of Gilsland, to his kinsman, Eustace de Vaux : the heiress of this branch brought it to the Burdons, and the heiress of Burdon to the Dentons, who sold it to William Lord Dacre e. Having since descended with the barony of Gilsland, it is now the property of Frederick Earl of Carlisle. In this parish, at a place formerly called Armathwaite, now Nunnery, was a convent of Benedictine nuns, founded by King William Rufus, in the second year of his reign. King Edward III. remitted to the prioress and nuns their yearly rent of 10/. in consideration of the losses they had suffered by the war with Scotland. In the reign of Edward IV. the monastery was almost destroyed by Scottish invaders, who took away their jewels, reliques, books, evidences, &c. ; the King, in consequence, granted them a confirm ation of all their possessions f. At the time of the dissolution, there were only three nuns in this house, besides the prioress. King Edward VI. granted the priory of Armathwaite, with the manor and various lands thereto belonging, to William Greyme, e This is the account given by Mr. T.

This was William Greyme, or Graham, of Rose trees and Netherby, in the parish of Arthuret, who settled the priory estate on his younger son, Fergus. The site of the priory having acquired the name of Nunnery, continued to be the seat of this branch of the Grahams till about the year 1690, when George Graham, Esq. sold it to Sir John Low ther, Bart. ; Sir John exchanged it with John Aglionby, Esq. for Drumburgh castle : it is now the property and residence of Mrs. Eliz. Bamber, widow, elder sister of the late Christopher Aglionby, Esq. the last heir male of that ancient family, who died in 1785. The pleasure grounds, which are laid out on the banks of the little river Croglin, exhibit a great variety of picturesque scenery. Nunnery is much resorted to by strangers, but the grounds are allowed to be shewn only on Fridays. Crossfield house, built by Henry Aglionby, Esq. who died in 1759, is at present untenanted. The church, which lies in the diocese of Carlisle, and deanery of Allerdale, was appropriated to the nunnery. The rectory and advowson of the vicarage, were granted by King Edward VI. to Sir John Peryent and Thomas Reve, Gentleman. In 1688 the advowson of the vicarage was in the coheirs of Mr. Leonard Barrow. Mr. George Lowthian of Staffold, who had married one of the coheiresses, became by purchase possessed of the whole of the tithes s, which now, together with the advowson, belong to his repre sentative, Richard Lowthian Ross, Esq.

The manor of Aldstone, then called Aldeneston, was restored in 1281 to Nicholas de Veteriponte or Vipont : it seems to have been originally granted to this family in the reign of King John. ' The only daughter and heir of another Nicholas, brought the lordship of Aldstone to Walter Stapleton, who died in 1457, leaving two daughters, the elder of whom married Sir William Hilton, and afterwards Richard Mus grave. The posterity of her first husband inherited this manor, which they possessed till the reign of James I. when it was conveyed to the Radcliffes. Upon the attainder of Francis Radcliffe, Earl of Derwentwater, in 17 15, it fell to the crown, and was soon afterwards settled by act of parliament on Greenwich Hospital. The valuable lead-mines in this parish have been elsewhere spoken of. The number of workmen employed in the mines, occasions the parish to be very populous. The returns under the population act in 181 1, state the number of houses at 461, occupied by 1013 families, and containing 5079 inhabitants. The church of Aldstone was appropriated to the monastery of Hexham, to whom it had been given by the Vipont family. It had been claimed in the reign of Edward I. by that monastery, as given to them by Ivo de Veteriponte, and confirmed by King Henry III. but the claim was disallowed, and the church said to be in the crown \". It is probable that they soon afterwards obtained a grant or confirmation of it. After the reformation, the rectory and advowson, as having been parcel of the possessions of that monastery, were granted to Sir John Peryent and Thomas Reve, Gentleman. There appears to have been a subsequent grant to Arthur Lee and Thomas Archer ; who having conveyed a third portion to Sir Thomas Hilton, the estate was for a long time thus divided. The trustees of Greenwich Hospital are now possessed of the whole of the impropriation and patronage, having purchased a third of the advowson of the present vicar, on condition and consideration that they would build him a good new vicarage-house, which condition they have performed. The parish of Aldstone is in the diocese of Durham and deanery of Corbridge. ' The Quo Warranto Roll of the 20th of Edward I. states the advowson of the church to have been given to William de Veteriponte, by King John, and it is most probable the manor was given at the same time. k Quo Warranto Roll, 20 Edward I. 4 There"], [305, "CUMBERLAND. 9 > There is a chapel of ease at Garragill, called in old records Gerardegill, at which service is performed every third Sunday.

The sum above mentioned was probably raised by a contri bution of the inhabitants. The commons in this parish, and the hamlet of Garragill, (except those in Priorsdale and Gildersdale,) have been inclosed under an act of parliament, passed in 1803, by which allotments of land were given in lieu of tithes to the impropriators. Allhallows, in the ward of Allerdale, below Derwent, lies five miles from Wigton, which is the post-office town. The manor of Whitehall appears to have been restored in the reign of Henry IV. to Sir Henry Percy. It was afterwards the property and seat of a younger branch of the Salkelds of Corby, After the death of Henry Salkeld, the last heir male, this estate became the subject of a long suit in chancery, by which it was at length adjudged to the Chaiitons of Nor thumberland, descended from Margaret, daughter of Sir Francis Salkeld, and is now the property of William John Chaiiton, Esq. ; the mansion has been long in ruins. The manor of Ukmanby or Upmanby, was given by Alan, second Lord of Allerdale, to Ranulph de Lyndsey, from whose family it passed by marriage to the Tilliols. A moiety of this manor was sold by the represen tative of one of the co-heiresses of the last mentioned family to the Salkelds, the other passed to the Highmores. The Blencows purchased of the latter, and Mr. T. Denton describes the manor of Upmanby as being in 1688, the jointure of Mrs. Mary Blencow, mother of Christopher Blencow, Esq. Mr. John Thompson is the present proprietor of the Upmanby estate. Harby, or Harby-brow, anciently called Leesgill, was for many genera tions the property and seat of the Highmore family. Nicholas Highmore sold it to the Blencows, who possessed it for several descents. This estate was purchased of the latter about the year 1 745, by Steel. It is now the property of William John Chaiiton, Esq. A square tower, which was part of the old mansion of the Highmores at Harby brow, still remains.

Arlecden or Arlochden, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about 61 miles from Whitehaven. There are three cattle fairs at this place, April 24th, the first Friday in June, and September 17th. The first is the most considerable. The manor of Arlochden belongs to Sir Roger Fleming of Rydal, in the county of Westmorland, Bart, to whose ancestor it was given soon after the conquest, by William de Meschines, Lord of Egremont, together with Frisington, another manor in this parish. The latter was held under the Flemings at an early period, by a family who took their name from the place of their residence. The co-heiresses of Frisington, in the reign of Henry IV. married Sackfield, Lawson, and Atkinson. This manor was then sold, and passed by successive conveyances to the families of Leigh, Patrickson, and Williamson. It now belongs to the Earl of Lonsdale, having been purchased of the Williamsons by Sir James Lowther, father of the late earl. Lands in this manor were inclosed by an act of parliament, passed in 1805. The parks (parcel of the demesne of this manor) are the joint pro perty of Edward Wolley Copley, Esq. and John Lamplugh Raper, Esq. as heirs of the Lamplugh family. This estate was some time since in the Fletchers of Hutton, one of whose ancestors purchased it of the Patricksons. The church of Arlochden is in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Richmond, and the deanery of Copeland. It was given to Calder abbey by the Flemings, in the year 1241, but was not long afterwards appropriated to the archdeaconry of Richmond. The Bishop of Chester is now appro priator and patron. The present lessee of the tithes is John Bradshaw, Esq. of Brookes House, near Sodbury in Gloucestershire.

Netherby, the seat of Sir James Graham, Bart., is pleasantly situated a small distance from the banks of the Eske. The greater part of it was built by the late Dr. Graham, on the site of an ancient mansion, the tower of which remains, although it does not retain its original appearance. The grounds are extensive, and have beautiful walks and rides on the banks of the Eske and Liddell. Not far from the house was the Roman station already spoken of. Leland speaks of some of the ruins of the Roman build ings as still remaining in 1539 p.

This castle was taken by William King of Scotland, in the year 1 1 74 q ; David Bruce took it by assault in 1346, and is said to have beheaded its governor, Sir Walter Selby, without allowing him time for confession r. Leland speaks of Liddell castle as having been at that time destroyed. Its site acquired afterwards the name of the Moat, and was occupied by a mansion, which in 1630 was the residence of Sir John Scot, and in 1657 was a seat of the Grahams.

The manor of Aspatria, as parcel of the barony of Allerdale belowr Der went, was given by Ranulph de Meschines to Waldieve, son of Gospatric Earl of Dunbar, and having passed with the barony, belongs now to the Earl of Egremont. The manor of Brayton gave name to a family, who were succeeded in its possession by a younger branch of the Salkelds. It was purchased of the co heiresses of the latter, in the early part of the last century, by Sir Wilfred Lawson, great-great-grandfather of the late Sir Wilfred Lawson, Bart., who died without issue in 1806. The title in consequence became extinct ; and this estate, since the death of his widow (which happened in 181 1), has passed under his will to Thomas, and on his death, in 1812, to Wilfred, younger sons of Thomas Wybergh, Esq. of Clifton Hall, in Westmorland, who married a sister of Lady Lawson's ; Wilfred, who is as yet under age, has taken the name of Lawson. Brayton-house was much improved by the late baronet, by whom also the grounds were laid out, and extensive planta tions made. The library, collected at a great expence, was particularly rich in works on natural history. Among the pictures are many of the best works of living English masters, particularly Northcote and Reinagle. Until of late years Isel had been the chief residence of the Lawson family. It is now occupied by Thomas Wybergh, Esq. as guardian to his son Wilfred. The deer-park at Brayton was disparked in 1798. The manor of Hayton was granted by Alan Lord of Allerdale to his huntsman Seliff, whose posterity took the name of De Hayton. From the Haytons this manor passed by a succession of female heirs to the families of Mulcaster, Tilliol, Colvill, and Musgrave. Nicholas Musgrave, Avho married the heiress of Colvill, was a younger son of Thomas Musgrave of Edenhall, and died in 1500. His descendant, Sir Edward Musgrave, was in 1638 made a. baronet of Nova Scotia.

It is said to have stood a long siege by the Parliamentarians, and to have been rebuilt by Sir Richard Musgrave, after the restoration. a It appears that the Mulcaster family had in ancient times a market at Hayton on Tuesdays, and a fair for three days at the festival of St. Mary Magdalen. b The manor of Outerby or Ughthredby, took its name from Ughtred, to whom it was given by Alan, second Lord of Allerdale. It was for several generations in the family of Orfeur, by whom it was conveyed to Sir Wilfred Lawson, great-great-grandfather of the late baronet. The manor of Allerby or Alwardby, so called from Alward, the first proprietor on record, gave name to the family of Allerby, whose heiress brought this manor to the Eglesfieldsc. It was purchased of their descendant in the latter part of the 1 7th century, by Richard Lamplugh, Esq. of Do venby, and is now the property of J. D.

He was born at Hayton castle in this parish, 8th October 1735: after the usual time spent in scholastic education, chiefly at Houghton le Spring, in the county of Durham: he was entered of the a Kimber's Baronetage. It is very likely that it was besieged in 1648, when several of the Cumberland castles were garrisoned for the king ; but we find no mention of this in any of the histories. Scaleby Castle, which belonged also to Sir Edward Musgrave in 1648, was then garrisoned and taken.

Bassenthwaite, in the ward of Allerdale below Derwent, lies by the side of the lake of that name, about four miles from Keswick, and about nine from Cockermouth. The manor of Bassenthwaite was given by Alan, the second Lord ol Allerdale, to his bastard brother Gospatric, whose posterity took the name of De Bassenthwaite. The last heir male of this family, was Sir Adam de Bassenthwaite, who died in the reign of Edward II. and left two daughters, co-heiresses, the elder having married two husbands, Irton and Lawson, settled her moiety of the manor upon her second husband, in whose posterity it continued till the death of the late Sir Wilfred Lawson. It is now under his will the property of Wilfred, the fifth son of Thomas Wybergh, Esq. a minor, who has taken the name of Lawson. This estate, called the manor of Low Bassenthwaite, is situated at Hawes. There was formerly a capital mansion here and a park, the seat probably of the Bassenthwaites. The other co-heiress married Martindale, whose descendant having been attainted of treason, it was granted to the Earl of Derby. In 17 14 this estate, called the manor of High Bassenthwaite, passed in marriage with Lady Henrietta Stanley to John Lord Ashburnham, who the next year sold it in parcels to the several tenants. The whole is held under the Earl of Egremont, who as Lord Paramount, is proprietor of the fine lake called Bassenthwaite Water, has the sole right of navigation and the whole fishery, except three draughts, called Ewes Bridge, Stone Wall, and Elers Stile, where John Spedding, Esq. has a right of fishery, as adjudged at the assizes at Carlisle in 1772. This lake is said to be about four miles and a half in length, and at the broadest part a mile and a half in breadth. Armathwaite, at the head of the lake, was a seat of the Highmores, of whom it was purchased by the great-grandfather of John Spedding, Esq. It is now the seat of Sir Fre derick Fletcher Vane, Baronet, who purchased it in 1796, after the death of the late James Spedding, Esq.

In the church-yard are me morials of the families of Story and Spedding. The church of Bassenthwaite, which lies in the diocese of Carlisle and deanery of Wigton, was given to the Abbey of Jedworth by Waldeof, son of Gospatric, and appropriated to that monastery. The dean and chapter of Carlisle are now appropriators, and patrons of the perpetual curacy. There is a chapel of ease at Hawes, in this parish. Beaumont, in Cumberland Ward, lies about four miles from Carlisle. The manor was anciently in the Bruns, Lords of Bowness, who were patrons also of the church : before the year 1380 it became the property of the Dacres, and has ever since been annexed to the Barony of Burgh, now belonging to the Earl of Lonsdale. The church, which, since the year 1692, has been held jointly with Kirk- Andrews upon Eden, is in the diocese and deanery of Carlisle. This small rectory was augmented by Queen Ann's bounty in 1772, aided by a benefaction of 200/. from the Countess Dowager Gower. This parish has a share of the interest of 50/. bequeathed by Mr. Thomas Pattinson, in 1785, for the purpose of educating the children of the poor of Beaumont, Kirk- Andrews, and Grinsdale.

The parish takes its name from Bega, an Irish Saint, who is said to have founded a small monastery here about the year 650. This monastery having been destroyed by the Danes, was restored by William Meschines, Lord of Egremont, in the reign of Henry I. for a prior and six Benedictine monks, as a cell to St. Mary's Abbey at York.

The parish is in the diocese of Chester, arch deaconry of Richmond, and deanery of Copeland. The grammar school at St. Bees was founded by Archbishop Grindall, who was a native of Hensingham in this parish, and died in 1583. The archbishop gave a sum of money for the building, and directed lands and other revenues of the yearly value of 50/. to be purchased, assigning the sum of 20/. per annum, as a salary for the master, and five marks for the usher. The founder's statutes were confirmed after his death, and the governors incorporated 27 Eliz.

The present revenue of the school is 112/. 10s.

Sir John Lowther, who died in 1705, gave 5/. per annum to the school, and a valuable library, to which Sir Joseph Williamson made considerable additions.

About the year 1748, this estate became the property of Anthony Benn, Esq. There was a dispute concerning the manor between the Lowther family and the Benns, which was determined by the late Earl of Lonsdale's purchasing Mr. Benn's right. It is now the property of the present Earl. The chapel at Hensingham was built about the year 1790, by the contri butions of Mr. Benn and other inhabitants.

The Castle J, his Lordship's seat at Whitehaven, where he occasionally resides, is a large quadrangular building, the greater part of which was erected by the late Earl on the site of a former mansion.

In the reign of Queen Elizabeth there was only a small fishing village at Whitehaven, containing six houses. Its subsequent increase in population surpasses even that of Falmouth, which was indebted for its rise, and much of its progress, to the Killigrew family ; but its present state of population and opulence was caused by its local advantages long after that family became extinct. Whitehaven still continues to thrive and prosper under the auspices of the noble descendants of the family to whom it owed its existence. Sir John Lowther having conceived the project of extending the collieries, procured in the year 1666 a grant of such lands as had belonged to the monastery of St. Bees, and still continued in the Crown ; and in 1678 a further grant of all lands (about 150 acres) for two miles northwards (200 yards in breadth) between high and low water mark. Sir John having thus laid the foundation of the future importance of Whitehaven, commenced his great work \\ and lived to see a small obscure village, which in 1633 had consisted only of nine thatched cottages, grown up into a thriving and populous town, which in 1693 contained 2,222 inhabitants'.

The trade at Whitehaven consists chiefly in the exportation of coal, lime, freestone, alabaster, and grain ; and the importation of West Indian, American, and Baltic produce ; flax and linen from Ireland ; and pig-iron from Wales. The trade of this place, and the coalworks, have already been spoken of more at large. There are six ship-builders' yards at Whitehaven : the vessels built at this port are in great repute. There is an extensive manu factory of sail-cloth, established in the year 1786, and some large rope-yards. A market at Whitehaven on Thursday, and a yearly fair on the 1st of August, were granted to Sir John Lowther, Bart, by King Charles II. in 1660. There are nowr three weekly markets, \u2014 Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, for butcher's meat, fish, flour, oatmeal, and other provisions. There are two market-places ; called St. George's Market and New- Market. The fair, which is now held on the 1 2th of August, is chiefly for Yorkshire cloths, Irish linen, and hardware. A few horses are sometimes exposed for sale. There are four batteries for the protection of this port. They were repaired, and furnished with an additional number of guns, in consequence of the daring attempt made by the noted American pirate, Paul Jones, in the year 1778, to destroy the port and shipping, which would have proved but too successful, had not one of his men deserted and given the alarm to the inhabitants.

It was not ready for consecration till the year 1693. The ecclesiastical courts for the district are held twice a year in this chapel ; and the Bishop of Chester holds visitations and confirm- ations in it.

Another chapel, on the hill, built by Mr. Hogarth, was intended to have been consecrated as a chapel for the Church of England, but a caveat having been entered against it by the impropriator of St. Bees, the consecration never took place, and the chapel is now occupied by the Cal- vinistic methodists, who have another meeting-house in Michael Street. There are two meeting-houses for the Scotch presbyterians9; one for each of the following sects \u2014 anabaptists, quakers, and Wesleyan methodists ; and a Roman catholic chapel : the Glassites and Sandemanians also have small congregations. A school for the education of poor children in the principles of the established church, on the system recommended by Dr. Bell, was established in the year 1813. There are now about 200 boys and 150 girls in this school. The Whitehaven Dispensary, instituted in 1783, has been conducted on an extensive scale, suited to the population of the town, and has contributed in a very great degree to alleviate the distresses of the poor. Since its insti tution, the total number of patients has been 125,396. Of these, 53,887 have been registered patients, whose cases have required continued atten tion, and of the latter 50,000 have received their cures.

The chapelry takes its name from the Lake so called : it is about eleven miles distant from the mother church. The manor was anciently parcel of the Barony of Egremont, a part of it as such still belongs to the Earl of Egremont ; the remainder which had been given to King Henry VIII. by the Earl of Northumberland, was granted to Robinson, passed by sale to Stanley, by marriage to Herbert, and by suc cessive sales to Patrickson and Lawson. It was sold after the death of the late Sir Wilfred Lawson, to the late Joshua Lucock Bragg, Esq., of whose trustees it has been lately purchased by John Marshall, Esq. of Water-Millock. The chapel was augmented by lot in 1723. Mrs. Mary Moorhouse built a school at Mockerton in 1782, and endowed it with the interest of 200/.

It comprises the townships of Bailey, Belbank, Bewcastle, and Nixons, and in 181 1, contained 215 houses and 1069 inhabitants. This parish, which in ancient records is written Both castre and Buethcastre, is supposed to have obtained that name from its ancient fortress. Bueth was Lord of the manor at the time of the Norman conquest, and is mentioned in one of the early charters of Lanercost priory. In the reign of Henry II., the manor of Bewcastle being in the crown, was granted to Hubert de Vallibus. In the reign of Edward L, this manor was in the Swinburn family: John de Swinburn in 1278 had a grant of a market at Bothcastre on Mondays, and two fairs, one for five days at Lady-day, the other for the same time at the festival of St. Barnabas. Jacoba, heiress of the Swinburns, brought this estate, in the reign of Edward III. to Sir John Strivelin. It does not appear when or how it came to the crown ; King Edward IV. granted it to his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester ; after this, it continued in the crown till the reign of Charles I., when it was granted to Sir Richard Graham : having since passed with the Netherby estate, it is now the property of Sir James Graham, Bart.

A large tract of land in this manor, and in the parish of Bew castle, containing about 4000 acres, was inclosed by an act of parliament, passed in 181 1. An act for inclosing Highstone moor or common in this parish, passed in 18 14. The church of Bewcastle or Buethcastre was given by Robert de Bueth castre, about the year 1200, to the Prior and convent of Carlisle : the advowson of the rectory is now vested in the Dean and Chapter. The celebrated obelisk in the church-yard has been elsewhere spoken of. There is a Presbyterian meeting-house at Bewcastle. Bolton, anciently Bothilton, in the ward of Allerdale below Derwent, lies about six miles from Wigton, which is the post-office town. It com prises the townships of Bolton and Bolton-gate, which in 181 1, contained collectively 179 houses and 975 inhabitants. The Manor of Bolton was given by Alan Lord of Allerdale, to his bastard brother Gospatric, whose posterity took the name of Bassenthwaite ; from this family it passed by marriage to Lascells. Thomas de Lascells was Lord of Bolton in the reign of Henry III. ; in the reigns of Edward I. x and II., it was in the Moubrays, and some years afterwards in the Nevills, from whom it descended through the Percy's to the Earl of Egremont, who is the present proprietor.

The market was granted in the year 1347 to John de Hudleston, to be held on Wednesday, and a fair for four days at the festival of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross z. The market is still held on Wednesday, chiefly for butchers' meat ; there are now two small fairs, April 5 and September 25, for cattle and hiring servants. At Seton, formerly called Lekelay, in this parish, was a priory of Bene dictine nuns, before the year 1354. In 1357, Henry Duke of Lancaster, on account of their poverty, gave them the Hospital of St. Leonard, at Lan caster, with its revenues ; this priory, nevertheless, was valued at the time of its dissolution only at 12/. 12s. per annum. It was granted in 1542 to Sir Henry Askew, whose widow possessing it by her husband's gift, bestowed it on William Penington, her younger son by her second husband ; it is now the property of Mr. Wakefield of Kendall, by purchase from the late Lord Muncaster. Seton-hall, formerly the seat of Sir Henry Askew, is occupied as a farm-house ; there are some remains of the priory chapel, with lancet-shaped windows. The parish of Bootle is within the seigniory of Millom, now belonging to the Earl of Lonsdale.

Bowness, in Cumberland ward, lies on the sea-coast, on the south side of Solway Frith, about fourteen miles from Carlisle, at the western extremity of the Picts' wall ; it contains the townships of Anthorn, Bowness, Drum burgh or Drumbugh, and Fingland. In 1 8 1 1 the whole number of houses in the parish was 176; that of inhabitants, 907. Bowness was at a very early period parcel of the barony of Burgh ; one of the first barons gave it to Gamel le Brun, or Broyne, as the family afterwards spelt their name ; the Broynes continued to possess it for several genera tions, having their chief seat at Drumburgh, which was one of the Roman stations on the Wall*. In the year 1307, Richard de Broyne had the King's licence to fortify his mansion of Drumbogh, in the Marches of Scotland ; and a similar licence was granted to Thomas Dacre, Baron of Burgh, as Lord paramount. The Broynes became extinct in the male line b about the latter part of the fourteenth century, after which Bowness appears to have been re-united to the barony of Burgh, as it still continues, being now the property of the Earl of Lonsdale. There are considerable remains of the castle at Drumburgh, which appears to have been rebuilt in the reign of Henry VIII. by Thomas Lord Dacre0. John Aglionby, Esq. purchased the demesne of Drumburgh, in the year 1678, of Henry Duke of Norfolk, and repaired the castle d, then in ruins ; some years afterwards he conveyed it to Sir John Lowther, in exchange for Nunnery.

Brampton, in Eskdale ward, is a small market-town between nine and ten miles from Carlisle, and 315 from London. The market at Brampton was granted in 1252, to the Multons, then lords of Gilsland, to be held on Tuesday, together with a fair for two days at Midsummer s. The market, which is now held on Wednesdays, is largely supplied with corn, (which, by permission of the Earl of Carlisle, is sold toll-free,) potatoes, butter in the firkin, butchers' meat, &c. There are now four fairs, viz. the second Wednesday aster Whitsuntide, the second Wednesday in September, the 15th of April, and the 23d of October; the two former are noted for the sale of young cattle and milch cows, sheep and lambs ; the two latter, established of late years, are chiefly for the shew of cattle previously to their going to the great market of Penrith in the spring, and that of Newcastle in the autumn. The parish of Brampton contains the townships of Brampton, Easeby, and Naward or Naworth Castle. The township of Brampton contained, in 181 1, 265 houses and 2,043 inhabitants; the whole parish, 353 houses and 2,543 inhabitants. The parish of Brampton is parcel of the barony of Gilsland, of which Naworth Castle is the seat. This barony was given in the reign of William the Conqueror by Ralph de Meschines to Hubert, who assumed the name of De Vallibus or Vaux ; his immediate posterity were of much distinction among the baronial families of the North ; Robert, his son, was sheriff of Cumberland, and defended the city of Carlisle during a long siege against William King of Scotland, but was obliged at length to surrender it for want of provisions ; Robert, the grandson of this Robert, was one of the barons in arms against King John. The sole heiress of Hubert de Vaux, son of the last-mentioned Robert, brought the barony of Gilsland to Thomas de Multon, in the reign of Henry III. The grandson of this Thomas died in 1 31 3, leaving an only daughter, Margaret, who being the King's ward, was forcibly carried away from Warwick Castle, in the year 1317, by Ralph f See the Quo Warranto Roll.

By the untimely death of George Lord Dacre (great-grandson of Thomas last men tioned), which happened in his minority in the year 1569, the great inhe ritance of this family was divided between his three sisters and coheiresses, and the barony of Gilsland fell to the lot of Elizabeth, who married Lord William Howard, third son of Thomas Duke of Norfolk. Leonard Dacre, the next heir male of the family, (second son of William Lord Dacre, who died in 1565), being discontented at the inheritance of his family going to females, and having no hopes of success in disputing it by law with his nieces, forcibly possessed himself of the castles of Naworth and Greystock, and fortified them, having collected together a force of 3,000 borderers and others ; but having been defeated by Lord Hunsdon with the garrison from Berwick, near Gelt-bridge, he fled into Scotland, and was soon afterwards attainted. Lord William Howard's marriage took place in 1577 ; it appears to have been late in life that he settled at NawTorth Castle, which Camden, who paid his last visit to Cumberland in company with Sir Robert Cotton in 1599, speaks of in his edition of 1607, as then repairing for his residence. Naworth Castle, which stands on the brink of a precipice, being almost inaccessible on three sides, is said to have been garrisoned by Lord William Howard with 140 men. His own suite of private apartments in the eastern towrer, barricadoed with iron doors, are still to be seen with their original furniture. They consist of a bed room, oratory, and library ; many books belonging to the latter have the autograph of their original possessor, written in a very fair hand.

These no doubt were the ancient prisons of the barony, the court of which had the power of life and death : it appears on record, that beheading was the punishment of felons : there was formerly a prison at Brampton also for the barony of Gilsland. ' Sir Charles Howard, great grandson of Lord William, was in 1661 created Earl of Carlisle. Bishop Gibson tells us that Naworth Castle, which had been some time in a neglected state, was fitted up by Charles, the third Earl of Carlisle : this Castle is occasionally inhabited by the present Earl. The site of the old church of Brampton, of which the chancel only remains, is a mile and a half from the town, on an eminence overlooking the river and vale of Irthing. The chapel at Brampton, in which divine service is now performed, was consecrated in 1789. The church of Bramp ton, which is in the diocese and deanery of Carlisle, was given to the priory of Lanercost, by Robert de Vallibus, and appropriated to that monastery. After the dissolution the rectory and advowson of the vicarage were granted to Sir Thomas Dacre, and are now vested in the Earl of Carlisle. The late Dr. Thomas, Bishop of Rochester, gave a dwelling house with a garden and close, to the vicar : the vicar has the tithe hay of the township of Talkin, in the adjoining parish of Hayton. There is a meeting house at Brampton for the presbyterians, who have had a congregation here ever since the year 1672; the present meeting house was erected in 1722, by subscription. Edward, Earl of Carlisle, who died in 1692, built an hospital at Brampton for six poor men and the same number of women, called Brethren and Sisters, to each of whom he assigned 61. per annum, a gown and fuel. A salary of 1 2/. per annum was allowed for a person to officiate as minister of the chapel, and master of a school.

The manors of Bride- Kirk and Appleton, with the church of Bride-Kirk, were given by Waldeof, the first Lord of Allerdale, to Gisborne priory in Yorkshire ; after the dissolution the manor was granted by King Henry VIII. to Henry Tolson. This manor has long ago been enfranchised. J. D. Bal lantine Dykes, Esq. being proprietor of Bridekirk Hall, and a great part of the demesne lands, pays the fee farm rent of il. 6s. to the crown.

Thomas Tickell, the poet, the friend of Addison, and editor of his works, was also a native of Bride-Kirk, of which his father was vicar. He was baptized January 19th 1686-7. p The manor of Broughton, including both the townships of that name, was given by Waldeof, Lord of Allerdale, in marriage with his sister, to Waldeof, son of Gilmin, whose posterity took the name of Broughton, and resided here for several generations. After this family became extinct, about the reign of Henry VI. Broughton seems to have reverted to the Earl of Northumberland as Lord of Allerdale. Henry, the sixth Earl of Northumberland, conveyed it to Sir Thomas Wharton. Charles, Duke of Somerset, purchased it of the trustees of the Duke of Wharton, and it is now vested in his representative the Earl of Egremont.

The tithes of Redmain were given to the pensioners of the hospital, subject to the payment of 4I. per annum, to the master for reading prayers; the tithes of Brough are appropriated to the master: the tithes of Redmain, in the reign of Charles I. were let at 18/. per annum, and are said to be worth now about 30/. The Rev. Thomas Hervey, born at Dovenby in 1 740, published a treatise on short hand, in which he much excelled ; a treatise on the 39 articles ; an explanation of the church catechism, and other tracts. He left in MS. a treatise on the theory and practice of music on mathematical principles, and a new literal translation of the Old Testament with the Hebrew cha racters annexed. He was curate of Under-Barrow, near Kendall, for 40 years, to the time of his death, which happened in 1806. Papcastle, which appears to have been a Roman station, was the seat of Waldeof, Lord of Allerdale, before he removed to Cockermouth. It was afterwards successively in the Lucies, Multons, and Dacres. Being vested m the crown by the attainder of Leonard Dacre, it was granted by Queen Elizabeth in 1595, to Lancelot Salkeld, Thomas Braithwaite, and Richard Tolson ; soon afterwards this manor was the property of Sir Thomas Lam plugh, who settled it upon Agnes, his wife, daughter of the said Thomas Braithwaite for life '. It was sold with the manor of Dovenby, by one of the Lamplughs, and has passed with that estate to William Browne, Esq. of Tallantire Hall, the present proprietor. Thomas Knight, Esq. is building a handsome mansion for his residence, on some ground lately purchased within or adjoining to the site of the Roman station; many antiquities have been discovered in sinking the foundations. The members for the county are always elected at a place called \" the Goat,\" annexed to the township of Papcastle. The manor of Ribton belonged to a family of that name, descended from a younger son of Waldeof, son of Gilmin before mentioned, the Ribtons continued to be possessed of it as late as the reign of Henry VIII. : it passed afterwards by purchase to the Lamplughs.

In the year 1776 it was purchased of Henry Hopper, devisee of Fletcher Partis, Esq. by William Browne, Esq. whose son of the same name, is the present proprietor, and resides at Tallantire Hall. The parish of St. Bride or St. Bridgett, lies about ten miles from White haven, and includes the township of Calder, where there is a post office at Calder Bridge. Calder Abbey, on the banks of the river Calder, nearly a mile above the bridge, was founded for Cistertian Monks in the year 1 134, by Ranulph de Meschines, the second of that name. Its revenues at the time of the dissolution were valued at 50/. gs. T>ld. per annum. The site, with the manor of Calder, &c. was granted in 1538, to Thomas Leigh, L.L.

John Senhouse, Esq. grandson of Mr. Tiffin, became possessed of it by gift, and it is now the property and residence of Miss Mary Senhouse, his elder grand-daughter. There are considerable remains of the abbey adjoining the mansion, a modern brick edifice, pleasantly situated in the vale of the Calder, the banks of which are wrell skirted with wood. Sella Park, said to have been formerly a cell belonging to Calder Abbey, where they had a deer park, was granted by the crown to the Curwen family. It was purchased of Mr. and Mrs. Curwen, by the late Mr. Stanley of Ponsonby Hall. This place is now the property of his son Edward Stanley, Esq. and in the occupation of the Rev. John Smith. The manor of Great-Beckermot, in this parish, belongs to the Earl of Egremont, as parcel of the barony of Egremont.

Brigham, Blindbothel, Buttermere, Cockermouth, Eaglesfield, Embleton, Grey-Southern, Mosser, Setmurthy, and Whinfell. The whole parish, exclusively of Lorton, contained in 1811, 1008 houses, and 4918 inhabitants. The manors of Brigham, Grey-Southern, and Eaglesfield, were given by William de Meschines to Waldeof, son of Gospatric : the latter gave Brig ham w to Dolphin, son of Alward, in marriage with his sister ; after a few descents it was divided into moieties between the coheirs of Brigham ; one moiety after remaining for some time in the family of Twinham, and after wards in that of Hercla, was forfeited by the attainder of Andrew de Hercla, Earl of Carlisle, and given to a chantry in the church of Brigham * ; this moiety, after the dissolution, was granted to the Fletchers of Moresby, and was sold to the tenants. The other moiety was successively in the famdies of Huthwaite and Swinburn; it was sold by the latter in 1699, to the Honourable Goodwin Wharton; in 1727 the trustees of the Duke of Wharton sold it to Mr. Wilfred Grisdale ; after the death of his daughter, Mrs. Lucock, and her only daughter, it passed under his will to Mr. William Singleton, who died in 1767 ; on his death this and other estates became vested jointly in several persons under Mr. Grisdale's will, and having been divided by virtue of a commission of partition, issued out of the court of chancery, this moiety of the manor of Brigham was allotted to Joshua Lucock, Esq. and is now the property of his grandson Raisbeck Lucock Bragg, Esq. The Earl of Egremont is Lord Paramount. In the parish church, which has the only ring of bells in the county, except the cathedral and Crosthwaite, are some monuments of the family of Langton of Cockermouth, (1777, 1790).

Allotments of lands were made in lieu of tithes to the Earl of Lonsdale, who was impropriator of the whole parish, in Eaglesfield, Blind-Bothel, and Brigham, and power given to make such in Cockermouth. Lord Lonsdale is patron of the vicarage of Brigham, and of all the chapels within the parish. The township of Buttermere is situated in a deep valley, amidst the romantic scenery which surrounds the lake of that name, about 10 miles from Cockermouth. This township, with the lake, is holden of the Earl of Egremont, as parcel of his manor of Braithwaite and Coledale. The Duke of Norfolk has an estate here, which was granted by King Edward VI. to Lord Gray and Banister, and was afterwards successively in the families of Robinson, Stanley, Lamplugh, and Spedding. There is a chapel at Buttermere. Cockermouth, in the parish of Brigham, is a considerable borough and market town, about 13 miles from Whitehaven, 26 *\u2022 from Carlisle, and 314 from London. Cockermouth is the site of the barony of Allerdale, since called the barony and honor of Cockermouth. This barony was given by William de Mes chines to Waldeof, son of Gospatric, Earl of Dunbar, whose grand-daughter brought it to William Fitz-Duncan, nephew of Malcolm, King of Scotland ; one of the co-heiresses of Fitz-Duncan, who was twice married, died without issue ; the two others, whose issue eventually shared this barony in moieties, married William Le Gros, Earl of Albemarle, and Reginald De Lucy ; the heiress of Lucy married Multon, who took the name of Lucy, Aster the death of William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle, and Isabel his countess, without issue, a moiety of the castle and honor of Cockermouth fell to the crown, and having been for a while in the possession of Piers Gaveston, by the grant of Edward II. was some years afterwards, (1323)*, granted to Anthony Lord Lucy % already possessed by inheritance of the y See Inquisition ad quod damp. 5 Edward II. 62. * Cart. 16 Edward II. 6. 1 It was granted to him for his gallantry and good services in taking Andrew de Hercla, Earl of Carlisle, prisoner, in 1322, in the castle of Carlisle, of which he was then governor'.

Elizabeth, sole heiress of Josceline, the last Earl of Northumberland, brought Cockermouth and other large estates to Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset. Lady Catherine, second daughter and coheiress of the duke, married Sir William Wyndham, whose son Sir Charles, wras in 1749 created Earl of Egremont, and was father of George Earl of Egremont, the present possessor of the honor or barony of Cockermouth. The park, which was long ago disparked, and sold to Sir Thomas Wharton, has been since reunited to the honor. Cockermouth Castle, the ancient baronial seat of the Lords of Allerdale, stands on a bold eminence near the confluence of the rivers Cocker and Derwent. It is supposed to have been built soon after the conquest, but there is no part of the present building, which exhibits the architecture of so early a period. Cockermouth Castle is said to have been yielded to King Henry IV. b It is erroneously stated in the history of this county by Nicolson and Burn, that it was made a garrison for the King in 1648, and that it was taken and burnt by the parliamentary forces. It appears by Whitelock and Rushworth, that the castle being held by Lieut. Bird, as governor for the parliament, was besieged for some weeks by a party of Cumberland royalists, and that it was relieved by Colonel Ashton, who was sent out of Lancashire by Cromwell for that purpose. An entry in the register of burials for the chapelry, informs us that \" the siege was laid against Cockermouth Castle, August 1648, and the castle was relieved the 29th of September, in which time were slain of* the besiegers George Bucke, &c. &c.c.\" Robert Murrell, shot in the castle September 21, is said to have been the only person slain in the garrison.

The ancestors of the Fletchers of Hutton, were opulent merchants at Cockermouth, and had a large mansion here, in which Mary Queen of Scots is said to have been lodged on her journey from Workington to Carlisle0 : this house was pulled down and rebuilt by Sir Richard Fletcher, who was sheriff of the county in 161 7 ; after a time this new structure acquired the name of \u00ab The Old Hall,\" and having lain in a neglected state for many years, was sold some years ago in lots by Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, Baronet, and has been divided into tenements. Both this borough and Egremont returned members to parliament in the 23d year of King Edward I. This privilege, after so long a disuse, was restored to Cockermouth in the year 1640. The right of election is in the burgage holders, who are about 280 in number d. The bailiff is the returning officer. The late Earl of Liverpool, before his elevation to the peerage, was some time M.

The market on Monday, was granted to William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle, in 1226% it is a considerable market for corn, provisions, &c. A great market or fair is held every other Wednesday f, from the beginning of May till Michaelmas, and there are annual fairs on Whit Monday and Martinmas Monday for hiring servants. Browne Willis states the number of houses at Cockermouth only at 235 in 1 7 14; in 1785 there were, according to Hutchinson, 663 famdies, and 2652 inhabitants; in 1801 there were 417 inhabited houses, 690 families, and 2865 inhabitants; in 181 1, 602 houses, 709 families, and 2964 in habitants, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods. In the year 1647, I9I persons died of the plague, as appears by an entry in the parish register. The town seems to have escaped this dreadful malady in 1665. c The narrative, printed in Anderson's Collections, which was corrected by Secretary Cecil, says, that Mary was conducted by the gentry of Cumberland to Cockermouth, a town of the Earl of Northumberland's. It should seem more probable, that she was lodged in the castle, but it is said that Henry Fletcher entertained her with great magnificence at his house, presenting her with robes of velvet, and that she wrote him a letter of thanks.

There are meeting houses in this town, for the Presbyterians, Quakers, and Methodists. The Rev. John Fell, an eminent dissenting minister, born at Cockermouth in 1735, wrote on the Demoniacs, on Rowley's poems, on English grammar, and on the idolatry of Greece and Rome. He died in London, in the year 1797. The free school was founded in the reign of Charles II. by Philip Lord Wharton, Sir Richard Graham, and others. The sum of 10/. per annum is paid to the master by Lord Lonsdale, as charged upon the great tithes, and a further sum of i ol. has for some years past been added as a gratuity. Over the school house is a library, founded by the associates of the late Dr. Bray, to which Dr. Keene, Bishop of Chester, was a considerable benefactor. In the year 1760, the Rev. Thomas Leathes gave a house in Kirkgate for the residence of six poor widows or unmarried women, above 60 years of age, and left the interest of 100/. as an endowment, to which his daughter added 50/.

In 18 1 1, the whole parish contained 387 houses and 1808 inha bitants, according to the returns then made to parliament. The manor of Bromfield anciently written Brunfield, was given by Wal dieve, Lord of Allerdale, to his physician Melbeth, whose posterity took the name of De Brunfield. Adam de Brunfield gave the manor of Brunfield to the abbey of Holme-Cultram. The abbey of St. Mary at York had also a manor belonging to their church, which was given them by Waldieve. The whole was granted by King Edward. VI. to Henry Thompson, in lieu of the hospital of Maison Dieu, in Kent. The greater part of this estate was afterwards in the Porters of Weary-hall, who enfranchised most of the lands ; the manor and demesne of Bromfield, passed by successive sales to the families of Osmotherly and Barwis, and are now the property of the Reverend John Barwis, who has also the manor of Lower-Scales.

The church of Bromfield, which is in the diocese of Carlisle and deanery of Wigton, was appropriated at an early period to the abbey of St. Mary, in York : the patronage of the vicarage was at the same time vested in the Bishop of Carlisle. The impropriate tithes of the greater part of the parish were granted with the manor to Thompson as before-mentioned. An act of parliament having recently passed for the inclosure of the com mons of Bromfield, Scales, and Langrigg, Sir Henry Fletcher claimed to be entitled to the corn tithes of those townships, the vicar to the hay tithes. The allotments have not yet been made. The great tithes of Allonby, Meahigg, and West-Newton, belong by purchase to the land-owners. The townships of Dundraw and Allonby have been inclosed under acts of par liament passed in 1813 and 18 14. Allotments of land were given in lieu of tithes in the township of Dundraw. Before the reformation, there was a chantry of St. George at Bromfield, endowed with lands of considerable value. A free-school was founded at Bromfield in 1612, by Richard Osmotherly, and endowed by him with 1 ol. per annum, payable by the merchant-taylors' company0: this has been augmented by subsequent benefactions; and the endowment is now about 40/. per annum, including the rent of certain lands (12/. per annum) the donor of which cannot be ascer tained.

The fishery is chiefly for herrings ; during the last two summers (18 13 and 1 8 14) it was particularly productive. Sometimes cod are taken in considerable quantities in the winter season. The manor of Allonby belonged antiently to a famdy who took their name from this the place of their residence : from them it passed by succes sive female heirs, to the families of Martindale, Flimby, and Blennerhasset ; by the latter it was sold to the Thomlinsons, about the beginning of the last century, and now (under the will of their uncle, John Thomlinson, Esq.) belongs to Anne and Catherine, daughters of the late Colonel Thomlinson, who are minors. A chapel at Allonby, built by the Reverend Dr. Thom linson, (of the Blencogo family) was consecrated in 1745. The founder having given 200/. for that purpose, it was soon afterwards augmented by Queen Anne's bounty, and has since received a second augmentation : the patronage was vested in Dr. Thomlinson and his heirs. There is a Quakers meeting-house at Allonby. The widow of Dr. Thomlinson gave the sum of 100/. for the use of a school at this place : this having been laid out in the purchase of lands at Blencogo, now produces 8/. per annum. The manors of Blencogo and Dundraw were given by Waldeof or Wal dieve, Lord of Allerdale, to Odard de Logis. Blencogo being then in the crown, was granted by King Henry VII. to Sir Richard Cholmley. Queen Elizabeth in 1589, granted this manor, described as having been lately in the tenure of Sir Richard Cholmley, to Walter Copinger and Thomas Butler of London, Gentlemen, trustees, probably, for the Barwis family, to whom it was conveyed by them p. The Thomlinsons purchased it about the latter end of the seventeenth century : it now belongs to the daughters of Colonel Thomlinson. The posterity of Odard de Logis above-mentioned, assumed the name of Dundragh or Dundraw from the place of their residence.

In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the Porters were possessed of the manor, and the Osmunderleys or Osmotherleys of the demesne.

William Osmunderley of Langrigg was Sheriff of Cumberland in the reign of Henry IV., and in the preceding reign the same person, or a person of the same name, wras one of the knights of the shire.

In Hutchinson's History of Cumberland is an account, taken from the Gentleman's Magazine r, of a family of freeholders named Reay, said to have \"been, from a very early period, possessed of an estate called the Gill, in this parish, now the residence of Mr. John Reay, father of John Reay, Esq., one of the present sheriffs of London. William Reay, some time Bishop of Glasgow, and William Reay, author of a volume of sermons, still in much esteem, are said to have been of this family ; and John Ray, the celebrated naturalist, wiio was a native of Essex, is said also to have been descended from it.

The manor of West-Newton, was given by Alan, second Lord of Allerdale, to Odard de Wigton, whose posterity took the name of Newton. The heiress of Newton brought this estate to the Martindales, who con tinued to possess it for four or five generations, after which a co-heiress brought it to the Musgraves. It is now the property of Mrs. Joliffe, relict of William Joliffe, Esq. M. P., and sole heiress of Sir Richard Musgrave Hylton, Bart. The mansion belonging to this estate was castel lated ; nothing remains of it but the fragment of an old tower. Burgh-upon-Sands, in Cumberland ward, lies about five miles from Carlisle : it contains five townships, Burgh-upon-Sands, Boustead-hill, Long-Burgh, Moorhouse, and West-end. The total number of houses in the parish in i8n,was 164; that of inhabitants, 668: the village of Burgh contains 83 houses and 369 inhabitants. The barony of Burgh was given by Ranulph dc Meschines to Robert de Estrivers or Trivers, who married his sister. The heiress of Robert married Ranulph Engayne, whose grand-daughter Ada, brought this barony to the Morvilles. Sir Hugh Morville, Lord of Burgh, was one of the four knights who murdered Thomas a Becket. Ada, one of his coheiresses, brought Burgh to the Multons, who were also barons of Gilsland. The Dacres, by marriage, inherited both baronies ; and the co-heiresses of Dacre brought them to two branches of the Howard family. Henry Howard, Duke of Norfolk, in the year 1684, sold the Barony of Burgh to Sir John Lowther, Bart., from whom it has descended to the present noble owner, the Earl of Lonsdale. There was formerly a castle at Burgh, which is said to have been taken by William, King of Scotland, in 1174': the custody of it was granted in 1253, to Stephen Longespee5. Leland speaks of the ruins of this castle, as still remaining in the year 1539. King Edward I. died at Burgh, on his expedition against the Scots, July 7, 1307'. An obelisk, commemorative of this event, was erected in 1685, by Henry Duke of Norfolk, on the marsh where this illustrious monarch is supposed to have died in camp ; but it is more probable that he was lodged and died in the castle. The inscription on the west side of the obelisk, was as follows : \" Memorise \u00e6tern\u00e6 Edwardi I. Regis Angli\u00e6 r See Polydore Virgil. s Cart. 37 and 38 Hen. III. 13.

The vicarage is in the gift of the crown. There is a Quakers meeting house at Moorhouse. The mansion at Moorhouse, which was some time the seat of Joseph Liddell, Esq. is now by purchase, the property of Major Richard Hodgson, and unoccupied.

In the reign of Henry VIII. a coheiress of Eglesfield brought it to John Senhouse, Esq. of Seascales, at which place the ancestors of this ancient family had been settled for several generations. A younger son of this John settled at Netherhall, now the property and residence of his im mediate descendant, Humphrey Senhouse, Esq. John Senhouse, the founder of the Netherhall branch, is spoken of by Camden as having made the col lection of Roman antiquities at this place. That learned writer and his friend Sir Robert Cotton, the collector of the Cottonian library, were hos pitably entertained by Mr. Senhouse at Netherhall in 1599. Richard Sen house, one of his younger sons, was made Bishop of Carlisle in 1624. There is a small deer-paddock at NetherhaU. The town of Maryport, in the district of NetherhaU, has of late years become very populous. TiU the year 1750 there was only one house at EUen-footb, the present site of the town of Maryport. The town owed its origin to the exertions of the late Mr. Senhouse's father, who called it Maryport in compliment to his wife. Mr. Pennant, writing in 1774, says, that there were then above 100 houses at Maryport.

Cod-fish are caught in great abundance in the winter-season, and salmon-trout in the river Ellen in the summer. There is a considerable market at this place for butchers'-meat and all sorts of provisions on Friday, and a smaUer market on Tuesday.

There is no doubt that this city, called by the Britons Caerleyl or Caer-leol, was the Luguvallum of the Romans mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus. We are told by two of the Scottish historians ' that Carlisle, one of the strongest of the British towns was burnt by the Scots during the absence of the Romans in the reign of the Emperor Nero. It must have been after this event, and probably in the time of Agricola, that Carlisle was for tified with walls by the Romans as a strong frontier town, against the invasions of the Picts and Scots. So durable was their structure, that notwithstand ing the recorded desolation of this town by the Danes, and the many sub sequent repairs of the walls after its sundry sieges, much Roman masonry remained till of late years in different parts, particularly on the east side. When St. Cuthbert was at Carlisle in 685, we are told by Bede, that the citizens took him to see the walls and a well of curious workmanship made by the Romans.8 It was about the year 875, that Carlisle was destroyed by the Danes ; and from that time, according to all our historians, it lay desolate till after the Norman conquest h. None of the historians speak of any thing being done towards restoring the city before the time of William Rufus, except Matthew of Westminster, who says, that Ranulph de Meschines began it as soon as he had received the grant of Cumberland from the conqueror ; and that William himself, on his return from Scotland in 1 072, gave orders for fortifying Carlisle. If this account is to be credited, it seems clear that little progress was made at that time in the work ; for the same author, in common with all the other historians, attributes the restoring of Carlisle and the building of the castle to William Rufus, who was at this city, and garrisoned it in 1092. That monarch sent a colony from the south of England to inhabit the city, and to cultivate the neighbouring lands. It is probable that the for tifications were some years in finishing, for it appears, that King Henry I. f Fordun and Hector Boethius.

Fordun attributes the building of the castle, and the heightening of the walls to this monarch, and makes the date 1 138 : it is probable that he then gave orders for the latter, and for completing the buildings of the castle. This city being a most important frontier town was frequently besieged dur ing the wars between the English and the Scots, by which this county was par ticularly harrassed, in consequence of the contested claim to its dominion already spoken of. In the year 1 1 35 Carlisle wras taken possession of by David King of Scots, either by stratagem or a coup de main: in 1 173, it was ineffec tually besieged by William, King of Scotland ; who returning the next year, regularly invested the city and continued the siege for several months. The garrison reduced to great straits and on the point of surrendering, was relieved by the capture of the Scottish king at Alnwick. His successor, Alexander, took the city in 1 2 1 6 ; and as Fordun relates, afterwards the castle, which had held out during a protracted siege. Carlisle was surrendered to the English in 1217, and Walter de Grey Archbishop of York, sent to take possession of the castle. The writer of the Chronicle of Lanercost says, that the canons of Carlisle were banished by Gualo the Pope's legate, because, through fear of death, they had said mass for the Scottish king, when under sentence of excommunication. In 1296, Carlisle was besieged for four days by the Earls of Buchan, Menteth, and other Scottish nobles ; but was so bravely defended by its inhabitants, both men and women, that the siege was abandoned aster three days. William Wallace, passing that way with his army, summoned Carlisle the following year, but finding the garrison prepared, did not stay to besiege it. In 1 3 15, Robert Brus then King of* Scotland, besieged Carlisle for ten or eleven days'; it was bravely and successfully defended by its governor, Andrew I The following particular account of this siege, translated from the Chronicle of Lanercost, in the British Museum, affords a curious specimen of the manner in which sieges of fortified towns were at that time conducted. \" A.

Moreover, on every day of the siege, they made an attack on some one of the three gates of the city, and some times on all three together ; but not with impunity, for darts, arrows, and stones, as well then as at other times, were cast down upon them from the walls in so great abundance, that they questioned among themselves, whether the stones did not increase and multiply within the walls. But on the fifth day of the siege, they erected an engine for casting stones near the church of the Holy Trinity, where their King had placed himself, and continually threw great stones towards the Caldew gate, and at the wall, but did no injury, or but little to those within, except that they killed one man. There were, indeed, within the city, seven or eight similar engines, with other warlike instruments, called Springaldes, for throwing long darts ; and slings in sticks for casting stones which greatly terrified and annoyed those who were without the city. In the meanwhile, the Scots erected a great berefray, in the manner of a tower, the height of which considerably exceeded that of the walls ; which being observed, the carpenters of the city erected a wooden tower, which exceeded the height of the other, upon one of the towers of the wall, towards which that engine must have come, if it had approached the wall ; but it never drew near to the wall, for when it was drawn upon wheels over moist and clayey ground ; there it stuck by reason of its weight, nor could it be drawn any further or occasion any inconvenience. \" But the Scots applied many long ladders which they had brought with them, for the purpose of ascending the wall in the same manner in different places, and a sow for undermining the wall of the city, if they found it practicable ; but neither the sow nor the ladders availed them any thing. They also made bundles of straw and grass in great abundance, to fill up the moat without the wall, on the east side, in order to pass over it dry ; they also made long wooden bridges running on wheels, that, being drawn forcibly and rapidly with cords, they might be carried across the ditch : but neither would the bundles, during the whole stay of the Scots there, fill up the moat, nor those bridges pass the ditch, but fell by their weight to the bottom. \" On the ninth day of the siege, when all the engines were ready, they made a general assault on all the gates of the town, and attacked valiantly throughout the whole circuit of the wall, and the citizens defended themselves as valiantly ; and in the like manner, on the following day. Moreover the Scots employed a stratagem similar to that by which they took the castle of Edinburgh ; they caused the greater part of their army to make an assault on the eastern part of the city, against the place of the friers minors, that they might draw thither the party within ; but the Lord James Douglas, a valiant and wary soldier, with certain of the more bold and alert of the army, posted themselves on the western side, over against the place of the canons and preaching friers, where, on account of the height [of the walls] and difficulty, an attack was not apprehended, and there erected long ladders which they ascended, and they had archers in great numbers, who discharged their arrows thickly, lest any one should raise his head above the wall : but, blessed be the Lord, they found such a resistance there, that they were thrown to the ground with their ladders, and there and elsewhere about the walls, some were taken, some slayn, and others wounded.

The Earl, who was unarmed, dictating letters in the great hall, imme diately surrendered himself; some of his servants cried treason ; and the porter making an attempt to close the inner gate, was killed by Sir Richard Denton.

In the month of July following, Sir Thomas Glenham, who Avas the commander-in-ehief in the North, after the capture of Newcastle, threw himself with his forces into Carlisle, where, in the month of October, he was besieged by General Lesley, with a detachment of the Scottish army; he defended the place, as Lord Clarendon observes, with very remarkable cir cumstances of courage, industry, and patience. Their provisions having been some time exhausted, and the inhabitants having been driven to sub sist on the flesh of horses, dogs, and other animals, the city was at length surrendered to General Lesley, who then lay before it with the Scottish army, on the most honourable terms, the 25th of June 1645 p- A coinage of 0 Vicars. \u00bb Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum is a very minute journal ot the siege by Isaac Tullie, who was in the town the whole time. From this journal we are enabled to give the following particulars. The besieging army consisted of 4,000 horse and foot ; the garrison with the townsmen in arms, of about 700. The principal works round the town were, General Lesley's at Newtown, Lord Kirkcudbright's at Stanwix, Colonel Lawson's over the bridge to the north-east, and Colonel Cholmley 's at Harraby. Lesley's head-quarters were at Dalston-hall. The walls were never assaulted during the siege. There were no sallies of any consequence ; the chief warfare consisted of skirmishes between the foraging parties, and the parties who guarded the cattle, with the besiegers ; and numerous gallant exploits on these occasions are recorded. The foraging parties were frequently successful in bringing in cattle till the end of April, but very insufficient to the wants of the garrison. The cattle were grazed in various places near the city \u2014 Wearyholme, Dentonholme, the Swift, &c, and this till near the end of the siege. At Christmas all the corn was taken from the citizens, and a ration distributed weekly to each family, according to their numbers. The cattle were seized also, and distributed in like manner ; no more being given to the owner than any other, except the head, heart, and liver. About the end of February they began to be on short allowance \u2014 half a hoop of corn being given to a head. There were then only 2, ico bushels in the granary. Fuel grew very scarce. The blockade appears not to have been at this time very strict, for the writer of the journal mentions Sir Thomas Glenham's going a coursing to Botchardby, with several gentlemen and gentlewomen.

Some officers and soldiers came to the common bakehouse, and took away all the horseflesh from the poor people, who were as near starving as themselves. June 22.

The shillings are rather uncommon ; the three shilling pieces extremely rare. In the year 1648, when some of the last efforts were made to restore the power of the captive monarch ; Sir Philip Musgrave, a zealous royalist, about the end of April took possession of Carlisle by surprise : the beginning of July he gave it up to the Duke of Hamilton, who garrisoned it with Scots, and appointed Sir William Levingston the governor : on the first of October it was surrendered to Cromwell, pursuant to a treaty made some time before, between the Marquis of Argyle and General Munroe. A large garrison was kept up at Carlisle two or three years after this ; we find mention of Major General Harrison having sent 2000 horse from the gar rison in pursuit of a party of Scots, in the month of June 1651 q. Sir Philip Musgrave, who had been so active a royalist during the civil war, and was in consequence proscribed by the parliament, was made governor of Carlisle after the restoration. During the rebellion of 1745, Charles Stuart having determined on the rash step of an invasion of this kingdom, entered Cumberland with the Duke of Perth, and an army of Highlanders ; they laid siege to Carlisle, which was but ill defended with a garrison of militia, and two small com panies of invalids, under the command of Colonel Durand, in the castle. The city was summoned on the 9th. The rebels approached in three divisions ; the Duke of Perth approaching from Stanwix, the Marquis of Tullibarden towards Caldewgate, and Charles Stuart towards the English gate. The latter had his head quarters at Blackhall and Moorhouse. The Duke of Perth was generalissimo of the army. The rebels lay before it till the eleventh, on which day they inarched to Brampton, where, famine any longer; several women met at the cross, abusing Sir Henry Stradling, the governor, who threatening to fire on them, they begged it as a mercy, when he went away with tears in his eyes, but said he could not mend their commons. The surrender was on the 25th. A curious feint was practised, to impress the besiegers with the idea, that reports of the distress of the garrison were untrue, a few days before the surrender. An officer, sent in by General Lesley, two days following, was sent back in a state of intoxication, from the contents of the only barrel of ale, which had been in the garrison for several months, and which had been brewed and preserved for some such purpose, by Dr. Burwell, the Chancellor, with the privity of the governor. A garrison of Scots was put in after the surrender, and the articles, says the writer of the journal, were strictly observed. Harl.

He returned to the siege on the 13th, and the town and castle being but ill-defended, were both surrendered on the 1 5th. The Pretender was immediately proclaimed King of Great Britain, and his son regent, by the corporation in their robes. The rebels, when they marched southward, left a small garrison in Car lisle. This, when they returned on their retreat to Scotland, on the 19th of December, was augmented, and the garrison was joined by several English, attached to the Pretender's interest. The Duke of Cumberland having pursued the rebels in their retreat, appeared with his army before Carlisle on the 21st of that month, but did not erect his batteries till the 28th, having waited for the arrival of cannon from Whitehaven. The gar rison surrendered on the 30th, without having been able to obtain any better terms, than that they should not be put to the sword, but reserved to be dealt with according to the King's pleasure r. Among the prisoners taken was the Rev. James Cappock, who had been made Bishop of Carlisle by Charles Stuart on his first entering the city. s It is not only on account of the sieges it has sustained, that Carlisle is zioted in history ; it has been the scene of many important transactions ; and the residence or occasional resort of many royal and illustrious per sonages. The visits of William the Conqueror, William Rufus, and Henry I. have been already mentioned. In 1 137 Walter Espec and other English nobles, repaired to Carlisle to aid David Brus, King of Scotland, against Malcolm, a traitor '. The following year David, attended by the bishops, priors, and peers of Scotland, received Alberic, the pope's legate, at Car lisle\". After the disastrous battle of the Standard, in 1139, David fled to Carlisle, where he was joined by his son Henry : this city seems to have been frequently the place of his residence ; here it was, that in the year 1 150 Prince Henry, son of the Empress Maud, (afterwards King Henry II.) received the honour of knighthood at his hands, and an alliance was entered into betv/een those princes and Ralph, Earl of Chester, against Stephen.

In the year 11 86, King Henry II. was with a great army at Carlisle ; the Scottish King also, and his brother David, appear to have been there at the same time, they being then on terms of amity with Henry. After the battle of Falkirk, in the year 1298, the brave and victorious Edward I. marched with his army to Carlisle, where a parliament is said to have been holden on the 15th of September; the same monarch was at Carlisle again with his army in the year 1300. In 1306 a general rendezvous of the army destined for the expedition against Scotland, under Prince Edward, was appointed at Carlisle. His royal father arrived at this city with his queen and court, on the 28th of August, and re mained here till the 1 oth of September : after a short progress in Nor thumberland, he was at Carlisle again for a few days in October. The parliament met at Carlisle on the 20th of January following ; but did not proceed to business till the 25th ; the King, who had been detained by illness ad the winter at Lanercost, was not himself present at it before the 28th of February, but sent his lord treasurer Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, to act as his commissioners w. This parliament was called together for the pur pose of considering the affairs of Scotland, and the exactions made upon the church by the pope's agents, and ordinances were made against these exactions, writs were issued also to bring the offenders to justice, but they were quashed at the intercession of the pope's legate, Peter D'Espagna, who attended that parliament for the purpose of settling the business of the marriage between Prince Edward and Isabel of France. The Cardinal is said to have preached in the cathedral on the subject of peace, and to have excommunicated Robert Brus x. The King celebrated his last birth day at Carlisle, in June, and appointed a general rendezvous of his army there on the 8th of July.

An express having been sent to Prince Edward, he arrived at Carlisle on the 1 ith ; after having been to Burgh to perform his father's obsequies, he received the fealty and homage of the nobility and prelates in the castle at Carlisle on the 1 3th y. This prince, who did not inherit either the courage or success of his father, returned to Scotland, but after a short stay, having abandoned his father's views with respect to that king dom, quitted the Scottish borders, and was at Carlisle again in the month of September following. Edward Baliol, the fugitive King of Scotland, was hospitably received at Carlisle by Lord Dacre, then governor, in 1332. King Edward III. was at Carlisle with his army in 1335. In the year 1537 the Bishop of Orkney and Bishop Tonstall, met at Carlisle as Commissioners, for settling a treaty of peace between England and Scotland. In the year 1568, the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, sought this place as an asylum from her enemies ; but it proved to be the first scene of that tedious captivity which ended not but with her death. On the 15th of May, being some days after Mary's escape from Loughlevin, ; Lord Herries wrote by her command to Mr. (afterwards Sir Richard Lowther) then deputy of Carlisle, requiring to know whether if the Queen of Scots, his sovereign, should be compelled to take refuge in England, she might come safely to Carlisle. Mr. Lowther answered, that Lord Scrope, the Lord Warden, being then absent, he had no authority in such a case, pertaining to the state of a Queen, to assure any thing ; but he would send by post to the court to know the Queen's pleasure ; meantime, if any necessity should force the Queen of Scots to come to Carlisle, he would gladly meet her and receive her into his rule, and save her from all her enemies, till the Queen's pleasure should be known. On Sunday, the 1 6th, before the messenger from Carlisle could return with Mr. Lowther's answer, the Queen and Lord Herries embarked with about eighteen or twenty persons in a fishing boat, and arrived the same day at Workington. At first she endeavoured to conceal her rank, but certain gentlemen of the county hearing of her landing,\" and understand ing that she was the Queen of Scots, brought her to Cockermouth. There she remained until Mr. Lowther, who was informed on the Monday night of her landing, had assembled the gentry of the county to escort her to Car lisle z.

The Queen having been informed, on the 20th, of Mary's arrival, sent express to the Deputy, requiring him to treat her with all honour and favour, and commanded Lady Scrope, the Duke of Norfolk's sister, with other ladies and gentlewomen, speedily to repair to Carlisle, and attend upon her. Lord Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles (her lord chamberlain) were at the same time ordered to repair to Carlisle, to watch the motions of the Queen of Scots, and report of her conduct. Mr. Henry Middlemore was employed also as an agent from the Queen to confer with Mary concerning her reception, and the crimes laid to her charge. In a letter to his royal mistress, dated the 29th of May, Sir Francis gives an account of the first interview which he and Lord Scrope, the Lord Warden, had with Mary : he describes her chagrin at not being admitted into the Queen's presence, and recommends to her Majesty's consideration whether it would not be more honourable in sight of her own subjects and of foreign princes, to suffer Mary to return to her own country, if such was her choice. In the event of its being determined to detain her, he observes, \" She can not be kept so rigorously as a prysoner with your hyghnes honor (in myn opynvon) but that w'h devyces of towels or toyes at hyr chamber wyndow or elsewhere in the nyght, a bodye of hyr agylyty and spyryte may escape soone beyng so near the border6.\" It having been determined to make Mary a prisoner, Sir Francis, though much against his inclination obliged to be her keeper, appears to have executed his trust with great fidelity. In a letter, dated June 1 5, he recommends Naworth Castle as a much safer place for her detention than Carlisle ; he assures the Queen that every precaution should be taken to prevent her escape, which was possible, considering the small number of guards he had to look to every place, and that semblance of liberty which it was thought advisable to allow her. It was for the purpose of giving such a semblance, as appears by this letter, that she was adowed to attend divine service at the cathedral church. It does not appear, however, that she had much indulgence with respect to air or exercise. \" Yesterday,\" says Sir Francis, in his letter of June 1 5, \" hyr grace went owte at a posterne to walke on a playing-greene toward Skotland, and we with 24 halberders of a This appears from a letter written by Sir Francis Knolles when on his journey to Carlisle.

The tower commands a rich and extensive prospect. This castle was probably the residence of the several royal personages, whose visits to Carlisle have been already spoken of. It was built, or rather begun to be built, as before stated, in the reign of William Rufus ; in the reign of Henry III. it was in a very dilapidated state, in consequence of the damage done to it when besieged by Alexander, the Scottish King, in 12 16, and which had not been repaired in the year 1256, as appears by the return to a commission of inquiry, directed to Sir Thomas de Lascelles and others \\ In this return the queen's chamber, Maunsell's turrett, the turrett of Widiam de Ireby, the chapel, great had, kitchen, and other offices, are represented as in I state of great decay.

' In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the castle appears to have been in a very ruinous condition. It is stated in a survey, made in consequence of a commission of inquiry in 1563, that the dungeon tower, (which should be the principal defence of the castle) was in a state of great decay ; and although the wads were twelve feet thick, was in daily danger of falling ; that there was a breach in the outer ward (made by a fall of the wall in 1557) sixty-nine feet and a half in length, which wad had been nine feet thick and eighteen in height ; the captain's tower also, and the gates, were much decayed. The great chamber and hall are spoken of in this survey. Upon this report the castle was ordered to be put in a state of repair. It appears that it was of sufficient strength in the middle of the following century to stand a siege of several months. Among the governors of Carlisle in the reigns of Henry III. and the three Edwards, we find John Baliol and Robert Bruce, the younger, both afterwards Kings of Scotland, William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle, Peter de Gaveston, the favourite of King Edward II. Andrew de Hercla, Earl of Carlisle, and John Halton and John Kirkby, successively Bishops of Carlisle \\ A small garrison is still kept in the castle ; the present governor is Major General R. Burne. The castle is the site of the ancient royal manor of the socage of Carlisle, partly within the city, and extending over 500 acres of land in its immediate vicinity. This manor was demised by Queen Elizabeth, at the beginning of ner reign, to Henry Lord Scrope, Lord Warden of the Marches ; and after his death to George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland. The lease was subsequently vested for several generations in the noble family of Howard, Earl of Carlisle, but the Duke of Portland having succeeded in his claim to this manor under King AVilliam's grant, as parcel of the forest of Inglewood, it was included in the late Duke of Devonshire's purchase in 1787, and is now the property of the present duke. During the interregnum the inheritance of this manor was sold to Mr. Craister of Carlisle, but of course it was resumed by the crown at the restoration. Capgrave says, that St. Cuthbert founded a nunnery at Carlisle, and placed an abbess in it, when he visited that city ; but this is erroneous, Inq. ad q. d. 18 Edw. III. k Whilst Bishop Kirkby was governor of Carlisle, an affray happened between his garrison and the citizens, in which several of the latter were killed and wounded.

We have no other record or memorial of this nunnery, which was destroyed by the Danes, and very slender notices of a nunnery said to have been founded by David, King of Scotland ', and of the convents of black and grey friers; both these were established in the year 1233, as appears from the chronicle of Lanercost. The black friers took up their abode -without the wads, the grey friers within the walls of the city. It appears by an ancient bird's eye view of Carlisle in the British Museum m, that they were afterwards both within the wads ; the black friers was on the south side of the citadel, between the English gate and St. Cuthbert's church. The county goal was part of the conventual buildings. The grey friers stood on the east side of English Street. In the reign of William Rufus, Walter, a Norman priest, began a monas tery at Carlisle : it was completed and endowed in 1 101 by King Henry I. who placed in it regular canons of the order of St. Augustine, and made his confessor, Adeluph or Athelwald, the first prior. The same monarch (in 1 133) founded the bishopric of Carlisle, and made Athelwald bishop. From its foundation to the present time, there have been 54 bishops of this see, among whom may be particularized as distinguished characters, John Kirkby, the martial prelate already spoken of; Roger Whelpdale, a learned writer on logic, mathematics, and divinity ; John Kyte, much employed in embassies by King Henry VII. and Henry VIII. ; Archbishop Usher ; Dr. William Nicolson, author of the Historical Library ; Dr. Edmund Law ; and Dr. John Douglas. The present bishop, Dr. Goodenough, one of the vice-presidents of the Royal and Linnean Societies, succeeded Dr. Vernon, now Archbishop of York, in 1807. Linstock Castle, in the parish of Stanwix, was for many years the only residence of the Bishops of Carlisle. The manor of Dalston, to which Rose- Castle is appertinent, was not granted to the see till the year 1229. It does not appear that they ever had a palace at Carlisle, although Bishop Halton, in the parliament holden at Carlisle, petitioned for a waste piece of ground, without the precincts of the castle, but within the city-walls, on which to build a house for himself and his successors. n 1 See Holinshed's History of Scotland, p. 263.

The advowson of the prebends was given to the Bishop by Philip and Mary, in the year 1557. Sir Thomas Smith, Queen Elizabeth's secretary, was the second dean. Among the more eminent persons who have since filled that situation may be enumerated, Bishop Atterbury ; Bishop Smalhidge ; Dr. Bolton, author of a popular essay on the Employment of Time, and other works of a simdar nature ; and Dr. Percy, the late Bishop of Dromore. The present dean is the Rev. Isaac Milner, D.D. who succeeded the Rev. Dr. Jeffery Ekins, the translator of Apollo nius Rhodius, in 1792. The deanery formed part of the monastic buildings : the cloisters, except a very small part now remaining, were destroyed in Cromwell's time. The refectory of the convent, caded the fratry, is now made use of as the chapter-house. It is probable that the cathedral was begun before the foundation of the bishopric, being intended as the conventual church. A church is mentioned by some writers among the buildings of William Rufus. That part of the structure which has withstood the devastation of fire and spoilers, exhibits the Saxon style of architecture. It appears that the cathedral church was destroyed by fire in 1292. We do not find any authority for its having been involved in the conflagration of 1390. The choir is said to have been rebuilt by contribution in the reign of Edward III. and the tower by Bishop Strick land in 1 40 1. The greater part of the nave of the cathedral, and most of the conventual buildings, were taken down during the Interregnum, and the materials used for repairing the walls and citadels. The remainder of the nave was waded up at the west end, and is now used as the parish church of St. Mary. The architecture of the cathedral, and the legendary paintings and inscriptions in the aisles, have been already spoken of. The bowels of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion are said to have been buried at Carlisle. Among the unknown ancient tombs in the cathedral are two which are supposed to be those of Bishop Welton, who died in 1362, and his successor, Bishop Appleby, who died in 1395. In the north aisle is the tomb of Bishop Strickland, who died in 1419.

In St. Catherine's chapel, is the tomb of Bishop Barrow, without any inscription. In the south aisle is the monument of Dean Wilson, who died in 1778 ; and on the floor, the gravestone of Jane, wife of Dr. William Paley, Archdeacon of Carlisle, who died in 1791. This distinguished and popular Theologian, whose works are too well known to need enumeration here, was himself buried in the cathedral in 1805; Du^ there is no inscription to his memory. He was several years archdeacon, and one of the prebendaries of this church, and at the time of his decease, enjoyed the subdeanery of Lincoln, a prebend of St. Paul's cathedral, and the valuable living of Bishop's-Wearmouth, severally given to him by Dr. Prettyman, Bishop of Lincoln, Dr. Porteus, Bishop of London, and Dr. Barrington, Bishop of Dur ham, in consideration of the great and deserved reputation of his theological writings. Bishop Vernon, his own diocesan, who had been the first patron of his distinguished merit, continued to show his friendship, and the high sense he entertained of his deserts by facilitating the arrangements for his subsequent promotions.

It appears that they held the city in fee farm, in the year 1 201 c ; in 1 23 1 they obtained a confirmation of former grants d. In 1292, they gave 10 marks for the privdege of having coroners of their own e. In the reign of Edward I., the citizens pleaded to a quo warranto, that they were entitled to murage for all goods exposed to sale in the town ; a free gudd, a market and fair, &c. They claimed the free guild under Richard the First's charter, and pleaded that the town had been originally demised to them in farm by King Henry I., but not being able to make good their claims in consequence of the records of the town having been destroyed by fire, they were not adowed. The fire here alluded to, was a dreadful confla gration which had then recently happened, on the 19th of May 1292. The whole city appears to have been consumed, with the priory, the convent of Grey Friers, and their churches ; the convent of Black Friers, being near the eastern wad, alone escaped. This dreadful conflagration is said to have been occasioned by an incendiary, who, from motives of resentment, set fire to his father's house, and was executed for the fact f. The King, in consi deration of this calamity, remitted the citizens a moiety of their fee farm rent, due the preceding year, and restored to them the city which had been taken into the King's hands by the justices of assize, by reason of the charters having been consumed as before mentioned, by the flames e. In the year 1352, King Edward III. in consideration of the importance of Carlisle as a frontier town, and the calamities the citizens had suffered by the plague, and by the assaults of besieging armies, granted them an ample confir mation of ad the privileges they had before enjoyed by prescription ; markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays ; a fair for 1 6 days, to commence on the as sumption of the Virgin Mary ; the election of a Mayor, badiffs, and coroners ; assize of bread, &c. ; pleas of the crown ; trial of felons h; goods of felons and fugitives ; the place called Battle-Holme, for holding their markets and fairs ; the city mill, the King's fishery in the river Eden, &c. &c.

The corporation consists of 12 aldermen, one of whom is annuady elected mayor, two bailiffs or sheriffs, two coroners, and 24 com mon-council-men, with power to elect a recorder and town clerk. There are eight fraternities or companies in this city, each of which has a had, or rather, room, for they are all under one roof, in Fisher-Street. They hold a general meeting once a year, on Ascension day. This city has sent two members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward I. The members are elected by the free burgesses, about 750 in number. a The markets at Carlisle are stid held on Wednesday and Saturday, and abundantly supplied with corn, cattle, and provisions of ad sorts. The principal market day is Saturday \\ There was formerly a horse fair, the first Monday in June, for three daysc, which has been many years discon tinued ; there is a considerable cattle fair on the 26th of August ; but the principal fair both for horses and cattle, is on the 19th of September. During these fairs, all persons are free from arrest in the city. A series of fairs or great markets for horses and cattle, commences on the Saturday after Oct. 10, and continues till Christmas. In the reign of Henry VI. in consequence, as it appears, of the assizes having been removed to other places, by occasion 'of the wars with Scotland, an act of parliament passed, by which it was ordained, that in time of peace or truce the assizes for the county should be holden at Carlisle, as had of old been accustomed, and not elsewhere. In the year 18 10, in pursuance of an act of parliament obtained three years before, for the purpose of \" enabling His Majesty to grant the citadel and walls of the city of Carlisle, &c. to the justices of the peace for the county of Cumberland, for building courts of justice for the said county,\" &c. the courts were begun to be built, in the Gothic style, from designs of Robert Smirke, Esq. Jun. R. A., and under his direction, within the wads of the ancient citadel, which consisted of two very large low round towers, flanking the English gate, and is said to have been erected in the reign of King Henry the Eighth. The courts were so far completed, as to be made use of for the assizes in the summer of the following year. A new county-gaol is about to be erected, under the same act of parliament, on the site of the Black Friers, adjoining the English gate. a Merchant, tanners, skinners and glovers, butchers, smiths, weavers, taylors, and shoe makers. b Mr. T.

We find, from the subsidy-roll of Ed ward III., that there were then 678 lay persons in Carlisle upwards of four teen years of age, besides paupers. This was soon after a very destructive pestilence. Nevertheless, in the year 1390, though a second pestdence had in the mean time occurred, Carlisle, if we may judge from the number of its houses, appears to have been even more populous than it now is ' ; for it is on record, that by a fire which had then recently happened, 1,500 houses were consumed in three of the principal streets, Castle-gate, Richard-gate, and Botchard-gate. ' We are told, that in the years 1597 and 1598 about 1,196 persons died of the plague at Carlisle, being a third of the whole number of inhabitants e, which will give a total of about 6,000. Mr. Denton computes the number at 5,060 in 1688 h. Browne Willis states them to have been about 2,000 only in 17 16. The manufactures began to increase considerably about 1760. In 1763 the inhabitants were numbered, at the request of Bishop Lyttelton, and found to be 4,158. In 1780 they were again numbered, under the inspection of Dr. Heysham, and found to have increased to 7,6/j. According to the returns made to parliament in 1801 and 181 1, the city and suburbs of Carlisle contained, at the former period, 1,338 houses' d Horse-racing appears to have been a very favourite amusement in Cumberland in the reign of Charles II. Mr. T. Denton, in his MS. enumerates several horse-courses ; as at Barrock-fell, in Hesket ; Low-Plaines, in the same parish ; Harethwaite Common ; Woodcock Hill, in Wood side ; the sands at Skinburness and Drigg ; at the latter was an annual race in May, with a plate of 10 /. established by Sir W. Pennington. Langanby Moor is called the famous horse-course of the North ; a famous horse-course in Westward also is mentioned, and one at Whitrigg in Torpenhow, which \" began at the foot of a hill called Car-mot, ana ended upon the top of Moothay, the ascent of which being so great a climb, they call that part of the hill, (says Mr. Denton, ) ' Trotter,' in regard that few horses can gallop up to the top thereof, but are forced to trot ere they come to the top.\" Sir Patrick Curwen was about that time a great patron of this amusement. c Carlisle was not then a manufacturing town ; it is probable that this was occasioned by greater numbers of persons then living within the walls as a place of security. 1 King Richard II. in consequence of this calamity, granted the citizens a remission of their fee-farm rent of 80 1, per ann. for four years; and 500 oais out of Inglewood forest.

Fuller mentions a manufacture of fustians established at CarKsle just before the Restoration, and expresses his wish that the undertakers might not be disheartened by their small encouragement. Carlisle first began to be of some importance as a manufacturing town about the year 1 745 k, when a large woollen manufactory was set up by some Hamburgh merchants, but after a few years it was discontinued. About 1750 a manufactory of coarse linen, and a new woollen manufactory, were set up. Soon after this, the cotton manufactory was introduced, and both that and the linen manu factory rapidly increased. Calico-printing was introduced about 1761. The principal articles of manufacture about that period were linen, checks, ca licoes, and fustians. A great change in the trade of Carlisle has taken place within the last fifteen years ; it now consists almost entirely of the manufacture of cotton goods upon a very extensive scale. About 1,200 looms are employed in tlus manufacture in the town, and a still greater number in the neighbouring towns and villages. The principal articles made are ginghams for the West India market. The spinning of cotton is carried on also to a considerable extent ; there being eleven cotton-mills in the town and immediate vicinity, containing about 80,000 spindles. There are three print-works, where the printing of cotton is carried on very extensively, and various other concerns connected with the cotton trade, such as dying, bleaching, &c. A small mill for weaving calicoes, a manufactory of carpets, and three iron founderies, have been lately established ; and there are four public breweries. It appears that there was a mint at Carlisle in the twelfth century, which seems to have been supplied with silver from mines in the county. ' The two bridges over the Eden at Carlisle, called Eden Bridge and Prest beck Bridge, were of wood in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; when one of them having fallen down, and the other being in a state of great decay, an act of parliament passed for rebuilding them at the expence of the county in Fifty-one of these were uninhabited, and there were seven new houses building. k Previously to this there was only a small manufactory of linen, besides that of whips and fish-hooks, for which it had been long noted, and which is still carried on. 1 When David King of Scots was at Carlisle in 1153, Henry archbishop of York made a com plaint to him that the King's men who worked in argentaria had committed devastations in his forest. The word argentaria might apply to a silver mine or a mint. In a record of Henry II. the lessee of the King's mine is spoken of. Carlisle is mentioned amongst other principal towns which had the establishment of a mint, 9 John.

The above-mentioned act of parliament, passed in 1807, having empowered the county to rebuild Prestbeck Bridge ; a new bridge was begun in the autumn of the year 181 2, from the designs and under the direction of Robert Smirke, Esq. junr, R. A. and is now (18 15) nearly completed: it is built of white freestone from the neighbourhood of Gretna, in Scotland ; and consists of five elliptical arches, each sixty-five feet in diameter. Govern ment advanced the sum of 10,000/. towards the building of this bridge, on account of its being in the direction of the intended new northern road to Port Patrick. Eden Bridge is to be removed, and a raised and partly arched causeway to be formed, connecting the town with the new bridge. Carlisle is divided into two parishes, St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's. The parish of St. Mary comprises the most populous part of the city ; the town ships of Caldewgate and Richardgate, or Richergate, in the suburbs ; the township of Cumbersdale or Comersdale, about two mdes south-west of the city ; the chapelry of Wreay, and the distant and detached townships or hamlets of Middlesceugh and Braithwaite, not far from Hutton, in the forest of Inglewood, and in Leath ward. The commons of these townships have been inclosed under the act of 1803, for inclosing the forest of Ingle wood. The manor of Middlesceugh belongs to Sir Frederic Fletcher Vane, Bart. ; that of Braithwaite to Henry Brougham, Esq. The dean and chapter's manor of John le Chappie, or de Capella, extends over the greater part of this parish. Hutchinson, quoting from Mdbourn's additions to John Denton's MS. gives an account of the manor of Caldcoates, alias Harrington House, afterwards called Coldale Hall, which belonged successively to the families of Canterelle, Semen, Coldale, Briscoe, Sibson, Dacre, and Forster. The Coldale- Hall estate, in Caldecote, held under the dean and chapter's manor of John le Chappie, now belongs to Henry Fawcett, Esq. M. P. for Carlisle. The manors of Caldcoates or Calcottys, Newbiggin, New-Laithes, and Botchard-gate, were granted by Henry VIII. to the dean and chapter, among others, as parcel of the possessions of the suppressed priory. The three former seem to have merged into what is now called the manor of John le Chappie, or de Capella, so called probably from John de Capella, the founder of a chantry in the cathedral church. This name does not appear in the grant, but in some old court-rods it is called the manor of John de Chappie alias Caldcoats. Newbiggin and New-Laithes are now called Granges. The Socage manor of Carlisle, as before mentioned, extends over part of this parish. The bishop's manor of Low-Dalston extends into this parish ; within"], [400, "78 CUMBERLAND. within which also was formerly a manor of Shaddon-gate, given by King Henry I. to one Morvin, whose son Harvey, gave it in marriage with his daughter, to Gwercius Flandrensis ; it was afterwards in the Dentons. The demesne, called Denton's Holme, was sold by George Denton, Esq. of Cardew, towards the latter end of the seventeenth century, to Mr. Nor man, and it is now the property of Mr. Dixon ; the tenements held under this manor were about the same time enfranchised m. Most of the lands at Shaddon-gate are now held under the bishop's manor of Low- Dalston, or the dean and chapter's manor of John Le Chappie. The parish church of St. Mary, is as already stated, within what remains of the nave of the cathedral ; the benefice is a perpetual curacy, in the gift of the dean and chapter, to wiiom the great tithes are appropriated. There was formerly a free chapel in Carlisle within this parish, with a cemetery, dedicated to St. Alban ; in 1356 all persons were forbidden to officiate in it, because it had not been consecrated ; it is probable that it afterwards received consecration, for we find that it continued till the refor mation, and was suppressed with other chantries and free chapels in the reign of Edward VI. ; it was then granted to Thomas Dalston, Esq. and William Denton. The site, wThich was near the town hall, is now divided into several tenements, held under the dean and chapter. In the parish of St. Mary are meeting-houses for the Presbyterians, Inde pendents, Baptists, Quakers, and Methodists, and a Roman Catholic chapel. Robert Milne, many years pastor of one of the Presbyterian congregations, who died at an advanced age in the year 1800, was author of Physico -Theological Lectures, &c. The Quakers have had a congregation here almost from the time of their first establishment : George Fox, their founder, was imprisoned in the dungeon at Carlisle, and suffered great hardships there in 1653. The grammar school, in this parish, was founded by King Henry VIII. being coeval with the establishment of the dean and chapter ; the endow ment is now 1 90/. per annum, of which the dean and . chapter, who are patrons, pay 20/., and the corporation of Carlisle 20/. ; the remainder arises from the produce of an estate in the parish of Addingham, purchased with the sum of 500/. given by Dr. Smith, Bishop of Carlisle, who died in 1702. It is expected that the value of this estate will be considerably increased, in consequence of an inclosure which is about to take place. The girls charity school, founded in 1717, was at first supported by subscription; Mr. Nicholas Robinson in 17 19, gave the sum of 40/. to this school, Mr. Samuel How in 1722, the sum of 320/.; with these sums, lands m T.

The chapelry of Wrea or Wreay \", in this parish, comprises the villages of Wreay and Newbiggin ; the chapel of Wreay existed at least as early as the reign of Edward II. ; it had no other endowment than the interest of a chapel stock of 200/. tid augmented, in 1737, by Queen Anne's bounty0. The present chapel was consecrated in 1739, when the nomination of the minister was reserved to the dean and chapter. The school here has an endowment of about 16/. per annum p: a school-house was built about the year 1760, before which time the chapel was used for that purpose. Wood side, in this chapelry, the seat of the late John Losh, Esq. has been for several generations in that family ; it is now vested in his executors. Newbiggin, formerly a manor belonging to the priory, has now merged into one of the other manors of the dean and chapter, the demesne was after the reformation divided into two estates, which are held on lease under the church. The hall was probably an occasional residence of the prior, who built there a tower of defence against the inroads of the Scots '. The walls of this mansion are nearly eight feet thick, and the whole of the first floor has a plain vaulted roof '. In 1688, Newbiggin hall, and a moiety of the demesne, were on lease to William Graham, Esq. from whose family the lease passed by purchase to the Lowthians. This estate is now in the occu pation, and the hall the residence of the Rev. S. Bateman, who married one of the coheiresses of Christopher Aglionby, Esq. Mrs. Baseman's interest in it, is under the will of her aunt, the late Mrs. Lowthian. The parish of St. Cuthbert comprises the district about English Street, the suburb called Botchard-gate, and the townships of High-Blackhall, or Blackwell, Low-Blackwell, Carleton, Harraby, and Uprightby, or Upperby. The six last, not included in the population of Carlisle, contain collectively 156 houses, and 855 inhabitants. The manor of Botchard-gate, formerly belonging to the priory, and now to the dean and chapter, extends over the greater part of this parish ; this township and the hamlet of Botchardby are said to have taken their name B This chapelry, not included in the population of Carlisle, contained in 1811, 21 houses and 108 inhabitants. \u00b0 T.

King Henry I. confirmed it to the latter, to be held by the sum of 6s. 2d. cornage money. The posterity of Guy took the name of Botchardby, and after four or five generations the family ended in females ; after this it seems to have been in severalties ; the whole or a part became the property of the Parvings, passed to the Stapletons, and by descent to the Musgraves ; a younger branch of the Musgraves had a freehold estate at Botchardby in 1688. \u00b0 In the suburbs of the city, at the south end of Botchard-gate, was a hospital for twelve poor men and a master, dedicated to St. Nicholas, said to have been of royal foundation. A moiety of the tithes of Little-Bampton, was given to this hospital before the year 11 80, on condition that two of the almsmen should always be of the parish of Bampton. This hospital was burnt and totady destroyed when the Earl of Buchan besieged Carlisle in 1 296, and experienced a simdar fate in a subsequent siege p. In the year 1477, the hospital of St. Nicholas, with its lands, was granted to the prior and convent of Carlisle, and with other possessions of that priory, passed to the dean and chapter at the reformation ; among the payments charged on the dean and chapter by King Henry's grant are 2I. 6s. 8d. to the chaplain of St. Nicholas's Hospital, and 5/. 175. to three poor bedesmen there. The ordinances and statutes of the hospital of St. Nicholas are exemplified on the Patent Roll of the 1 5th of Edward III. On the site of this hospital is now a private dweding house, the property and residence of Mr. Joseph Studholme. There are three almsmen, caded St. Nicholas Almsmen, who receive 40s. per annum each from the dean and chapter ; six other almsmen belonging to the cathedral establishment, have 5/. per annum each. Harraby-grange, in this parish, formerly called the manor of Henderbye, belonged to the prior and convent of Carlisle, now to the dean and chapter. The manor of Blackhall, anciently parcel of the forest of Inglewood, was given by King Henry I. to Odard de Logis, Baron of Wigton ; Mar garet de Wigton, heiress of this baronial house, in the reign of Edward III. gave this manor to Sir Robert Parvinge, the King's serjeant at law, for his care and pains in managing her cause, her title to the barony havino been impugned by the heir at law, Sir Robert de Kirkbride, on the ground of her mother's incontinency.

Joseph Dacre Carlyle, chancellor of the diocese, and professor of Arabic in the university of Cambridge, who died in 1804, aged 45, lies buried at St. Cuth bert. This gentleman having previously made oriental literature his parti cular study, accompanied the Earl of Elgin to Constantinople, and at his return published specimens of Arabic poetry, and other translations from that language. He was at the time of his death engaged in the publication of an Arabic bible, and left behind him in MS. a dissertation on the Troas, and a Journal of his Travels. Castle-Carrock, in Eskdale ward, lies about four miles from Brampton, which is the post-office town, and about ten from Carlisle. The manor was given in the reign of Henry II. by Hugh de Vallibus, Lord of Gilsland, to Eustace de Vallibus, whose posterity seem to have taken the name of Castle-Carrock, and inhabited probably the castle, from which the parish takes its name r. Robert de Castle-Carrock, the fourth in descent of that name, died in the reign of Edward I. and left three daughters, among whose posterity this manor having been divided, it long continued in severalties ; the whole is now vested in the Earl of Carlisle, whose ancestors purchased the several parts at sundry times. Some lands in this parish are held under Robert Sanderson Milbourne, Esq. of Armathwaite Castle. The rectory is in the patronage of the dean and chapter of Carlisle, having formerly belonged to the priory. An act of parliament passed in 1801, for inclosing the moors, &c. in the manor and parish of Castle-Carrock, under which an allotment was made to the rector in lieu of tithes, and an allotment of twenty acres for the endowment of a school. Cleatou, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about two miles from Egremont, and four and a half from Whitehaven.

There are two large iron manufactories at Cleator, for spades and other edge tools ; there is a large manufactory also for spinning flax and tow, making sewing thread, &c. which employs about 400 hands. Corney, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies within two miles of Bootle, which is a post-office town. The manor belonged at an early period to Michael the Falconer, whose posterity took the name of Corney ; the heiress of this family brought it to the Penningtons, ancestors of the Right Hon. Lord Muncaster, who is the present proprietor. The manor house, which is gone to decay, stood at a hamlet called Middleton Place. The rectory of Corney, which is in the diocese of Chester, archdeaconry of Richmond, and deanery of Copeland, belonged formerly to the abbey of St. Mary in York ; it is now in the patronage of the Earl of Lonsdale, the advowson having been purchased of the late Lord Muncaster in 1803. Croglin, in Leath ward, lies about thirteen miles from Penrith, which is the post-office town. The manor belonged at an early period to the family of Hastings, whose heiress brought it in the reign of Edward I. to the Whartons ; on this occasion the Whartons adopted the arms of Hastings, Sable, a maunch, Argent. Croglin was purchased of the Duke of Wharton's trustees, by Charles, Duke of Somerset, from whom it descended to the Earl of Egremont, the present proprietor, who possesses also the manors of Newbiggin and Brackenthwaite, in this parish. The advowson of the rectory was attached to the manor of Croglin, till the Duke of Wharton sold it to Matthew Smales, Gent. ; it is now the property of Mr. William Clarke of Wall's-end.

Crosby, in Eskdale ward, des four miles from Carlisle, and contains the townships of Brunstock, High-Crosby, Low-Crosby, and Walby. According to the returns of 1811, this parish then contained 70 houses and 410 inhabitants. The military road to Newcastle passes through the village of Crosby. The manor or barony of Crosby belongs to the bishop, having been always annexed to Linstock, which was assigned to the bishop and his successors, on a partition of the estates of the bishopric and the priory by Gualo, the pope's legate. Linstock and its dependencies were sometimes called the Barony of Linstock, and sometimes the Barony of Crosby. William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, held a moiety of this manor, in right of his wife Elizabeth, under the bishop, in the reign of Edward II. u The bishop has the appropriation of the great tithes of Crosby, (which is in the deanery of Carlisle,) and is patron of the vicarage. A school-house was budt by subscription at Crosby in the year 1803 ; the school is not endowed. Crosthwaite, a large parish, extends into two wards, containing the townships of Crosthwaite, Borrowdale, Braithwaite, Newlands, Portingscale, and Thornthwaite w, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, and those of St. John's, Castlerigg, Wythburn, Under-Skiddaw, and Keswick, in Allerdale below Derwent. The collective number of houses in these town ships (exclusive of Keswick) was in 181 1, 362, that of inhabitants 1973, according to the return then made to parliament. Borrowdale, wed known for its romantic scenery and its wad-mines, (already noticed,) was parcel of the ancient manor of Castlerigg, which belonged to the Derwentwater estate. The Lawson family had also a manor in BoMOwdale, which, after the death of the late Sir Wilfred Lawson, passed with his other estates ; it has lately been enfranchised by Wilfred Lawson, Esq. who has retained the royalties and woods ; within this manor is the vdl of Watenlath, in which is a small tarn, abounding with trout and other fish. \u2022 Inq. ad quod damnum, 14 Edw.

Braithwaite, Portingscale, and Newlands, are parcel of the Earl of Egre mont's manor of Derwent-Feds : the latter gives name to a beautiful and rich vale, well known by the descriptions of tourists ; the manor of Thorn thwaite belongs also to Lord Egremont. A sheep fair is held in Borrow dale on the first Wednesday, and in the vale of Newlands on the first Friday in September. In the chapelry of St. John are two vales, separated by the mountain of Nad dle-Fell, caded the Vale of Wanthwaite and the Vale of St. John; the former, which is most admired for its scenery, has been often taken for the latter. The manor of St. John and Castlerigg was part of the Derwentwater estate, now belonging to Greenwich Hospital. Hid-top House, overlooking the vale of St. John, was for several generations the property and residence of the Gaskarth family, it is now a farm house, the property of Lord Lons dale, who purchased it of the late Rev. John Gaskarth, the last heir male of the family. Lowthwaite House, in this township and manor, now the property and residence of Mr. Williamson, has been some time in his famdy. The manor of Wythburn belonged to the Brathwaites of Warcop. Sir Thomas Brathwaite, who died in 1640, was seised of the manors or hamlets of Wythburn, Armeboth, Smarthwaite, and Naddle, held of the Earl of Northumberland ; this estate was sold by Richard Brathwaite, Esq. to Sir George Fletcher, of Hutton-Hall, ancestor of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, Bart, the present proprietor. In the township of Wythburn is Dalehead, an ancient seat of the Leathes family, now the property and summer residence of Thomas Stanger Leathes, Esquire, who has a manor here called Legberthwaite, inherited from the late Mr. Leathes. y The manor of Brundholme, in the townships of Great-Crosthwaite and Under-Skiddaw, was part of the possessions given by Henry Earl of Nor thumberland, to King Henry the Eighth, who granted it to Thomas Dalston, Esq. ; it was afterwards in the Tolsons, who sold to Relph ; this manor now belongs to the Bishop of Llandaff, who purchased it of the Haseds of Dalemain. The celebrated mountain of Skiddaw, said to be 1100 yards in heighth, extends into several parishes and townships ; that part which is in Crosthwaite, is within the manor of Brundholme and the townships of Great-Crosthwaite and Under-Skiddaw.

Ormathwaite, within the manor of Brundholme, was the property, and in the latter part of his life, the residence of Doctor William Brownrigg, a very eminent provincial physician, (at Whitehaven) and a learned chemist, who appears to have been the real father of many of the modern discoveries in that science, particularly those relating to the properties of air. Dr. Brownrigg died at Ormathwaite January 7th 1800, in the 89th year of his age. He published a treatise on the art of making common salt, now become very scarce, and another on the means of preventing pestilential contagion. Ormathwaite is now the property of his nephew Sir John Benn Walsh, Bart, and in the occupation of Lieutenant Ponsonby of the Royal Navy. Monk-had, in the township of Great-Crosthwaite, spoken of by Mr. T. Den ton, as a small manor, and the site of a cell or chantry, formerly belonging to the monks of Carlisle, was in 1688 the property of Sir Daniel Fleming, Bart. and now belongs to his descendant the present baronet, of the same name. The manors of Castlerigg and Keswick, alias Derwentwater, belonged to the ancient family of De Derwentwater, before the reign of Edward the First. The heiress of Sir John De Derwentwater, in the reign of Henry the Sixth, married Sir Nicholas Radcliffe of Dilston, in the county of Northumberland, Knight, whose descendant, Sir Francis Radcliffe, was created by King James II. Earl of Derwentwater. James, the second Earl, having been engaged in the rebellion of 17 15, lost his head on Tower-Hill, and the above manors, with other estates, becoming thereby forfeited to the crown, wrere settled upon Greenwich Hospital by act of parliament. The Derwentwater family are said to have had a seat at Castlerigg, overlooking the fine lake from which they took their name ; their successors, the Radcliffes, built a house for their residence, on the island called Lords Island, now belonging to Greenwich Hospital. Leland, who was in Cumberland in 1539, calls this \" the Head Place\" of the Radcliffes. The beautiful scenery of this well known lake, said to be about ten miles in circumference, has often been described. Saint Herbert's Island, late the property of Sir Wilfred Lawson, Bart, now of Mr. Wilfred Lawson, (late Wybergh,) is so called from a hermitage there dedicated to Saint Herbert. It appears by the registers of the see of Carlisle, that Bishop Appleby granted an indulgence of forty days penance to ad the inhabitants of the parish of Crosthwaite, who should go thither to celebrate mass yearly on the 1 3th of April, in memory of Saint Herbert. Leland speaks of a chapel as remaining there 6 in"], [408, "CUMBERLAND. 86 in 1539. y Sir Wilfred Lawson kept a garrison in this island in the civil war.1 Vicar's Island, which belonged formerly to Fountain's Abbey, was granted by King Henry the Eighth to John Williamson : it was afterwards in the Ponsonbys of Hale. Mr. T. Denton says that Vicar's Island was inhabited by the Dutch mineral men ; and sold by a coheir of Joseph Hechstetter, the most experienced miner that England ever bred. Joseph Pocklington, Esq. having some years ago purchased Vicar's Island, built a house on it for his occasional residence ; he afterwards sold it to the present proprietor, General Peachey, who sometimes resides there during a part of the summer season. Mr. Pocklington stdl possesses a good house at the Barrow a, a beautiful situation on the eastern side of the lake ; but it has for some years been inhabited only by servants. On the western side of the lake is the seat of Lord William Gordon. The town of Keswick lies about 18 miles from Penrith, 254 from White haven, and 302 from London. It contained, in 18 11, 352 houses and 1,633 inhabitants. In the year 1300, Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Albemarle, being summoned to prove by what right she held a market at Crosthwaite, denied that she held any market there, but that the men of the neighbourhood met at the church on festival-days, and there sold flesh and fish, but that she, as lady of the manor, viz. Derwent-Fells, took no toll b. At the same time Thomas de Derwentwater proved his right to a market at his manor of Kes wick on Saturday, and a fair for five days at the festival of Saint Mary Magdalen'. Saturday is stid the market-day for corn and provisions. The ancient chartered fair, now held on the 2d of August, is almost dwindled to nothing : it was formerly noted chiefly for the sale of leather d, and a few years ago for wool.

A new market-house, with a turret, was built at Keswick in 1813. There are manufactories at Keswick of coarse woollen goods, blankets, kerseys, &c. Sir John Bankes, chief justice of the King's Bench, who was born at Keswick in 1589, gave 200/. to build a manufactory-house, and 30/. a-yeartowards raising a stock for the employment and maintenance of thepoor. The late Mr. Peter Crosthwaite, an ingenious native of this parish, in the year 1780 established a museum of antiquities and natural curiosities at Keswick : it is now shewm by his daughter. Mention has already been made of several antiquities, found in the neighbourhood or in the county, deposited in this museum, and in that of Mr. Hutton, which has since been formed and exhibited. The parish church of Crosthwaite, a handsome structure, with a ring of bells, stands about a quarter of a mile from the town of Keswick. In this church is the monument of Sir John Radcliffe, Knight, who died in 1527, and a memorial for one of the ancient family of Leathes : in the church yard are memorials for the family of Gaskarth of Hill-top. The church of Crosthwaite, which is in the diocese of Carlisle and deanery of Allerdale, was given to Fountain's Abbey. The tithes were purchased aster the Reformation by the land-owners. The Bishop of Carlisle is patron of the vicarage. The vicarage-house, situated on an eminence between the church and the town, commands a beautiful view of the lake and the surrounding mountain scenery. There are chapels of ease at Borrowdale, Thornthwaite, Newlands, Wythburn, and St. John's, in this parish. These chapels have all been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty ; the sums of 200/. each were given in aid by the Countess-Dowager Govver, for Borrowdale, Thornthwaite, and Wythburn. The ministers, with the exception of Saint John's, are appointed by the vicar. The minister of St. John's is appointed by Lord Lonsdale, and the landholders and occupiers. At Keswick is a meeting-house for the Independents, and another for the Wesleyan methodists; adjoining the town is a Quakers' meeting-house, but it has at present no congregation. There is a school at Keswick, endowed with lands now let at 118/. per annum, purchased with the amount of voluntary contributions, (to which it appears that the Company of the Mines Royal gave 20/. in the thirteenth year"], [410, "CUMBERLAND. 88 year of Queen Elizabeth,) and an assessment on each fire-house. The cock fights at this school mentioned in Hutchinson's History of Cumberland, have been abolished. The circle of stones on the summit of the hill near the road to Penrith has been already spoken of. Cumrew, in Eskdale ward, is about seven miles from Brampton, which is the post-office town, and about twelve from Carlisle. It is divided into the townships of Cumrew-Inside and Cumrew-Outside, containing together in 181 1, 41 houses and 194 inhabitants. The manor belongs to the Earl of Carlisle. The church, which is in the deanery of Carlisle, was formerly appropriated to the priory, now to the dean and chapter, who are patrons of the perpetual curacy. It has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. An act of parliament passed in 1796, for inclosing the commons of Cumrew and Cumwhitton : this benefice was, in consequence, much injured by the sheep-heaths being converted into grazing-ground for black cattle. About a quarter of a mile from Cumrew church, under the Fell, are the ruins of a castle, of which we find no mention in history or record. It is probable that it was the residence of some of the family of Vaux, lords of the barony of Gilsland. Cumwhitton, in Eskdale ward, is nine miles from Carlisle, and seven from Brampton, which is the post-office town. It comprises the townships of Cumwhitton, Moorthwaite, and Northsceugh, containing collectively, in 18 1 1, 91 houses and 478 inhabitants. Cumwhitton was given by Ranulph de Meschines to Hildred de Carlisle. In King John's reign it belonged to the Bavins, who, after possessing it for three generations, gave the manor to the priory of Lanercost, and the rectory to the priory of Carlisle c. The Earl of Carlisle is now lord of the manor. The small manor of Hornby, given also by the Bavins to the priory of Lanercost, came after the reformation to the Dacres, and was sold by Henry Dacre before the year 1688, to John Atkinson\"; it has lately been purchased by the several proprietors of the smafl estates which it comprehended. At Scarrow-hill is a freehold estate, which in 1688 belonged to the Scarrows, a family of great antiquity at that place6, since extinct; it is now in severalties.

The benefice has been twice augmented by Queen Anne's bounty, the first time by lot, the second time with the aid of a benefaction of 200I. given by Countess-Dowager Gower : the lands purchased produce now about 80/. per annum. The dilapidated cottage, called the Parsonage house, has by Mr. Anderson the present incumbent, who was instituted in 1809, been improved into a comfortable habitation. Leland mentions the chapel of the Moore, in this parish, of which there are no remains. Dacre, in Leath ward, lies about five miles from Penrith : it contains the townships of Dacre, Great-Blencowe, Newbiggin, Soulby, and Stainton. These townships collectively contained, in 181 1, 147 houses and 763 inha bitants. Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History, speaks of a monastery at Dacre, of which we have no later mention : it was probably destroyed by the Danes, and never restored. We are told by William of Malmesbury, that Constan tine King of Scotland and his son Eugenius King of Cumberland met King Athelstan and did homage to him at Dacre. This parish gave name to the ancient baronial family of Dacre, who had their seat at Dacre Castle, in this parish. Their posterity became by marriage lords also of Gilsland and Greystock. On the death of Thomas Lord Dacre without male issue, in 1454, his next brother, Ralph, succeeded to the baronies of Gilsland and Greystock, and he and his successors were called Lords Dacre of the North. Sir Richard Fynes having married Joan, the only daughter of Thomas Lord Dacre, was, by the King's patent, the same year, declared to be a baron of the realm, by the title of Lord Dacre of the South. Margaret, the sister and heir of Gregory Lord Dacre, married Sampson Lennard, Esq. of Chevening, in Kent, whose posterity inherited the title and the Dacre estate. Thomas Lennard, Lord Dacre, who was created Earl of Sussex' in 1675, lest two daughters, coheiresses, who, with their mother, sold the manors of Dacre and Soulby, in 1 7 1 5, to Sir Christopher Musgrave ; the latter conveyed them the same year to Edward Hasell, Esq. of Dalemain, grandfather of Edward Hasell, Esq. the present proprietor. Dacre Castle, a quadrangular building, with four turrets', erected about the reign of Henry VII. is now occupied as a farm-house. Dalemain, now the seat of Edward Hasell, Esq. belonged, in the reign of Henry II. to the Morvilles. In the reign of Henry III. it passed to the e See the account of the title of Dacre, under the head of Cumberland Nobility. s It has been repaired and fitted up as a habitation since 1688, when nothing remained of it but the bare walls.

The townships of Newbiggin, Great-Blencowe, and Stainton, are held under the Duke of Norfolk. The estate of the Blencowe family in Great Blencowe was sold by them to William Troutbeck, Esq. in 1802. In the parish church is a monument of one of the Dacre family : there are memorials also for some of the Hasells s. The figures of bears in the church-yard, and the Dacre monument, have been already spoken of. The rectory of Dacre was appropriated to the college at Kirk-Oswald, so late as the reign of Henry VIII. The King is patron of the vicarage. The townships of Dacre and Soulby have been inclosed by an act of par liament passed in 1806, by which lands were given in lieu of tithes to Edward Hasell, Esq. the impropriator, as lessee under the Crown, and to the vicar. The school-house at Dacre was built in 1749 : the school has an endow ment of 9 /. per annum in land, purchased with various donations, the chief of which was 60/. given by the family of Brown. At Great-Blencowe is a free grammar-school, founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by Mr. Thomas Burbank, or Bowerbank, and endowed with lands in Cumberland and Northamptonshire, now let at 220/. per annum. The trust is vested in eight feoffees, who nominate the master. At Stainton is a charity-school, endowed with the interest of 100/. given about the year 1780, by Mark Scott. Dalston, in Cumberland ward, lies four mdes and a quarter from Carlisle, which is the post-office town, and eight miles from Wigton. It comprises the townships of Dalston, Buckabank, Camdevock, Hawkesdale, Ivegdl, Raughton, and Gateskale, which in 181 1 contained collectively 423 houses and 2,369 inhabitants. Ranulph de Meschines gave the barony of Dalston to Robert de Vadibus (brother of Hubert lord of Gilsland), which Robert took the name of Dalston. After Cumberland had been ceded by King Stephen to the Scots, this family appears to have been dispossessed ; and the lordship having been given to a Scot, was seized by Henry II. as an escheat, and continued in the Crown tdl the year 1228, when King Henry III. gave the manor of Dalston to Walter Bishop of Carlisle, and his successors in the seeh.

King Henry's charter disforests the manor, and gives the Bishop and his successors authority to make parks, and to possess the manor as a forest of their own, with all the privdeges of a royal forest, forbidding all others to sport within its limits, under penalty of the payment of ten pounds. A subsequent charter empowers the Bishops, or others sporting in the manor of Dalston, with their permission, to follow their game and take it in the King's forest without molestation. On failure of male issue, the daughters of tenants of this manor inherit equally as coparceners. Rose Castle, which is situated in a beautiful valley, watered by the river Caldew, is supposed to have been the principal residence of the Bishops of Carlisle ever since the grant of the manor. King Edward I. appears to have been at Rose Castle in the month of September 1300'. In the year 1322, Rose Castle was burnt by Robert Brusk. Bishop Kirkby, in 1336, procured the King's licence to castellate his manor-house at Rose, which had then lately been injured by the incursions of the Scots1. It is said to have been again attacked and burnt by those hostile invaders the following year \u0153 ; probably the fortifications had not then been completed by virtue of the patent. Before the civil wars Rose Castle formed a complete quadrangle ; it had five towers besides turrets, and was encompassed with a wall, which also had several turrets. One of the towers was built by Bishop Strickland, who was promoted to the see in 1400, another by Bishop Bell, who was appointed in 1478, and a third by Bishop Kyte, who became Bishop in 1521. The north side of the quadrangle contained the constable's tower, with three rooms in it ; the chapel, with three chambers under it ; Bell's tower, at the back of the chapel, with two rooms in it, besides the clock-house ; next to the chapel, the Bishop's chamber, and another chamber under it; a large chamber called the council-chamber, and one chamber under it called Great Paradise ; and Strickland's tower \", which had three chambers in it, besides the vault : in ad seventeen rooms. The east side contained the great dining-room, with a cellar underneath ; a large hall and a buttery, with a cellar under each, a turret and one chamber near it ; a large kitchen with two chimnies, and a place for a cauldron or boiler ; a lodging below for the cooks, and a large cellar or vault : in all, six rooms.

The west side contained Pottinger's tower, in which were three lodging-rooms and a vault, a wash-house and a dairy, one chamber below, and three above ; adjoining to these, Kyte's tower, with two chambers : in all, twelve rooms. In the midst of the court, was a fountain, which conveyed water to all the offices in the house. In the month of June 1648, Rose Castle being held by a garrison of royalists, consisting of 40 men, was attacked by a detachment of General Lambert's army, and taken by storm, after an assault of two hours, the governor having refused two summonses'11. A few weeks afterwards, the Duke of Hamdton's army was joined by Sir Marmaduke Langdale's forces at Rose Castle n. Mr. T. Denton, in his MS. History of Cumberland, says, that Rose Castle was burnt down by order of Major Cholmley ; it had previously been made a prison for the royalists. \u00b0 The survey of Rose Castle made by order of parliament in 1649 or 1^5\u00b0> describes it to be in a state of great decay, and values the materials for sale at 425/. Mr. Heningham, who possessed a moiety of the manor during Crom well's time, fitted up the offices for his own residence p. When Bishop Rain bow came to the see in 1664, no part of the house was habitable : he built a few rooms for immediate use, and was obliged to rebuild the chapel, which had been insufficiently built by his predecessor q. Bishop Smith built the tower adjoining the staircase, and by him and his immediate successor the house was again rendered a comfortable habitation. Bishop Lyttleton repaired Strickland's tower, built a new kitchen and other offices, and made great improvements in the habitable part of the house. The late Bishop made several alterations conducive to comfort and convenience, and much improved, by various repairs, the external appearance of the castle.

Sir Wdliam Dalston, the immediate descendant, a zealous royalist, was created a baronet in 1640; the title and the male line of the elder branch of this ancient family became extinct by the death of Sir George, the fifth baronet, in 1765. Four years before his death he sold his estate at Dalston to Monkhouse Davison, Esq. after whose death it was purchased (in the year 1795) by Jorm Sowerby, Esq. the present proprietor. The old mansion of Dalston-Hall, built in a castellated form, is occupied as a farm-house ; the chapel is now used for some of the purposes of the farm. Dalston Hall was the head-quarters of General Lesley during the siege of Carlisle in 1644 and 1645. The manor of Hegheved, (or High-head,) in the township of Ivegill belonged in the reign of Edward II. to John de Hercla, who was attainted for being concerned in rebellion with his brother the Earl of Carlisle. In 1342 William L'Angleys, or English, had the king's licence to fortify his mansion at Hegheved, yet it appears that there had been a castle there before, belonging to the crown, for in the year 1326 Ralph Dacre had a grant of the custody of the castle of Hegheved for ten years, and the next year the custody was granted for life to William L' Angles, or L'Engles, who possessed himself of it under that grant, whereupon Ralph Dacre in 1330 petitioned parliament to be reinstated during the remainder of his term s. In 1358 the son of William above-mentioned, had a licence from the bishop to build a chapel there, and to have a chaplain to officiate in it. About the year 1550 High-head Castle was purchased of the family of Restwold, by John Richmond, Esq. in whose posterity it continued tor several generations. This castle and estate are now in moieties, one moiety belonged to the late John Gale, Esq. maternally descended from the Rich monds; the other is the joint property of several persons descended from Mrs. Baines, who was a Richmond. The half of the mansion, which be longed to Mr. Gale, has been many years uninhabited : his estate devolves to his son Wilson Braddyll, Esq. of Conishead priory ; the other part has been occupied by the tenants of the estate. Divine service is still performed at the chapel, which has a small endow ment ; the minister is nominated by trustees ; it has no cemetery.

In 1686 George Denton, Esq. sold the manor of Cardew to Sir James Lowther, Bart., from whom it has descended to Wdliam Earl of Lonsdale, the present proprietor ; Cardew-had, the old seat of the Den tons, has been long occupied as a farm-house. The manor of Gateskale u, or Gateskell, and Raughton, belonged to one Ughtred w, whose posterity took the name of Raughton : the last of that name having settled it upon his wife Margaret Stapleton, it passed to her family, and from them to the Hayton branch of the Musgraves : it is now the property of Mrs. Jolliffe.

The moors, &c. within the parish of Dalston, have been inclosed under an act of parliament, passed in 1803, by which allotments of land were given to the bishop as rector, and to the vicar. The commons in the townships of Raughton and Gateskell, and Ivegill, were inclosed under the act for inclosing the forest of Inglewood. The bishop is patron of the vicarage. The late celebrated Dr. Paley was vicar of Dalston from 1774 to 1793; he added a good parlour to the vicarage house, and rebuilt the stables. After the Restoration, this vicarage was augmented with an annual payment of 31/. Sd. charged on the great tithes, and Bishop Smith gave the sum of 300/. which has been laid out in lands near the vicarage. About the year 1343 a forty days indulgence was granted by Bishop Kirkby, to all such as should be benefactors to the chapel of St. Wynomaus, the bishop, in the parish of Dalston, or to the support of Hugh de Lilford, an hermit there ; there are no remains of this chapel, nor any tradition respecting it. About a mile from the parish church is a field called the Chapel-Flat, which probably was its site. There is a school at Dalston, endowed with a stock of no/, and a tene ment at Hawkesdale, given by Bishop Smith, now let for 36/. per annum. Under the act of 1803, there was an allotment for the purpose of erecting a workhouse and school-house, and a dwelling-house for the master. At Dalston are two large cotton mids occupied by Messrs. Waldies and Dugdales ; and another, a very extensive concern, near to Bishops-Forge, the property of Messrs. Hobson and Forster. The iron and plating forge now belongs to Mr. Thomas Watson ; the spades manufactured here are held in much esteem, and sent to many pa... of Scotland. The different manufactories are supposed to employ about 600 persons.

It comprises the town ships of Dean, Branthwaite, and Ullock, containing altogether in 181 1, 157 houses, and 752 inhabitants.

The manor of Branthwaite was given by Alan, son of Waldieve, in mar riage with one of his relations, to a person who took the name of Branth waite ; the heiress of this family married Sir Richard Skelton, whose posterity continued in possession for many generations. Gen. Skelton, who died in 1757, devised this manor to Captain Jones, whose son, Arnoldus Jones, took the name of Skelton, and died in 1793. The manor of Branthwaite is now the property of John Christian Curwen, of Workington, Esq. The church is a rectory in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Richmond, and deanery of Copeland ; the advowson was formerly annexed to the manor. The Rev. Henry Sill, is the present rector and patron. Dr. John Dalton, born at Dean in 1 709, being son of John Dalton, then rector, adapted Milton's Comus for the stage y, and published some poems and sermons. His brother, the late Mr. Richard Dalton, for many years held the office of surveyor of His Majesty's pictures, &c. In the seventeenth century the Quakers were very numerous in this parish. George Fox, their founder, in his journal, speaks of two general meetings held at Pardsey Crag in 1657 and 1663. z There is a free grammar school at Dean endowed in 1596, by John Fox, goldsmith, with a rent charge of 10/. per annum; the inhabitants recommend, and the goldsmiths company appoint the master : there was a benefaction also given to this school by the family of Fearon, but part of it having been lost, it produces now only 175. 6d. per annum.

The old house, \" built castle wise1,\" spoken of by Nicolson, has been taken down, and a modern mansion, which commands a fine sea view, built on the site. The manor ot' Ellenborough, comprising Netherhall, in the parish of Cross-Canonby and the township of Ellenborough, in this parish, belongs to Humphrey Senhouse, Esq. of Netherhall. b In the parish church are some ancient and curious grave-stones already spoken of; a monument for the family of Christian of Unerigg (1719, &c.) and that of William and Ann Bowman, who lived 64 years together as man and wife, and died in 1800, he aged 87, she 91. The church of Dearham was given by Alice de Romely, daughter of William Fitz-Duncan, to the church of St. Mary at Gisborne, to which the great tithes were appropriated ; they are now vested in the Earl of Lonsdale.

Near the vidage of Dearham is a considerable manufactory of coarse pottery. Over-Denton, in Eskuale ward, lies about six miles from Brampton, which is the post-office town. The manor of Over-Denton, which was anciently parcel of the barony of Gilsland, was conveyed in the reign of Edward I. by Richard Stonland to John Witherington, in whose family it continued several generations. a Mr. T.

The church is said to have been formerly in the diocese of Durham ; it was given by the Vaux family to Lanercost priory, to which the tithes were appropriated ; they now belong to the Earl of Carlisle, the benefice being a perpetual curacy in his gift. Nether-Denton, in Eskdale ward, lies five miles from Brampton, which is the post-office town. The manor was given by Eustace de Vallibus, to a family who assumed the name of Denton ; the heiress of Sir Richard Denton, married Copley of Yorkshire, and the heiress of Copley, in the third generation, married Adam de Had i, who took the name of Denton, and had from his father-in-law a grant of the arms of his maternal great grandfather Sir Richard Denton c. In the reign of Henry VII. John Denton exchanged this manor for Warnell-hall with Lord Dacre, from whom it has descended to the Earl of Carlisle. Denton-had has long been occupied as a farm-house. There are no traces of the tower mentioned in Hutchinson's history. Robert, son of Bueth, who possessed both the Dentons, gave the church to the monks of Wetheral ; it was afterwards given to the priory of Laner cost, winch caused a law suit between those monasteries, who eventually compromised the matter, and shared the profits between them, viz. certain payments out of the rectory. In 1266 the monastery of Wetheral released their share, two marks and a half, to the bishop. The rectory is in the bishop's gift ; it has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty, aided by a benefaction of 200/. from the Countess Dowager Gower. The Rev. William Reay, a native of this parish, of wldch his father was rector from 17 18 to 1736, published, when curate to Dr. Church at Bat tersea, in Surrey, a volume of sermons, which are held in much esteem, and sed for a high price ; they were published by subscription to assist their author, wiien laboring under a severe idness, of winch he died in 1756.

After the death of the last of the Fletchers, it was sold under a decree of chancery in 1720. John Brougham, Esq. of Scales, who was then the purchaser, conveyed it in 1737 to Sir James Lowther, Bart. It is now the property of Wdliam Earl of Lonsdale. Nicolson and Burn speak of the Dykes family as possessing the manor, and presenting to the rectory from the year 1484 to 1558. Hay, or Hayes-castle, of which there are some remains in that part of the parish which adjoins to Harrington, is supposed to have been the manerial site and the seat of the Moresby family, who possessed a moiety of the manor as early as the reign of Edward III. s ; it is now the property of Thomas Hartley, Esq. whose father, Mr. John Hartley, purchased it of Anthony Dickenson. The Earl of Lonsdale is patron of the rectory, which is in the diocese of Chester, archdeaconry of Rich mond, and deanery of Copeland. In the church-yard are some monu ments of the Blakeney family. The school at this place has no endowment, except three acres of land taken out of the common when the school-house was built. Drigg, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about three mdes from Ravenglas. The manor belonged in the reign of Henry II. to the Estotevills, and passed with the heiress of that family to Baldwin, Lord Wake. At a later period the Harringtons appear to have held the whole or part of the manor under the Lords Wake ; the heiress of Harrington married Curwen, and in the reign of James I. Sir Nicholas Curwen sold an estate described as the manor and advowson of Drigg, to Sir William Pennington, from whom they passed by inheritance to Lord Muncaster, the present proprietor. The Earl of Egremont is Lord Paramount of the whole, and a considerable part of the parish is held immediately under his barony of Egremont. Sir William Pennington, the first baronet, made a horse course on the sands at Drigg, in the reign of Charles II. where a plate of the value of 10/. was run for annually in the month of May.

Carlson, a hamlet of Drigg, is divided into tenements, holden of Lord Muncaster, as of his manor of Drigg. The parish is sometimes called Drigg and Carleton. Edenhall, in Leath ward, lies four miles from Pemith. The first pro prietor of the manor upon record is Henry Fitz-Swein ; in the reign of Henry III. it belonged to Robert Turp ; a co-heiress of that family, after three descents, brought it to the Stapletons, in whom it continued five descents, and then passed with a co-heiress to the Musgraves in the reign of Henry VI. Sir Richard Musgrave, who had been made Knight of the Bath at the coronation of James I. wTas made a baronet in the month of June 161 1, being one of the second list after the institution of the order. Sir Philip Musgrave, the second baronet, distinguished himself in the civil wars on the side of King Charles I. and is said to have been one of the last who despaired of the royal cause ; he took Carlisle from the parliament in 1648, and was made governor of that city. The present baronet is Sir Philip Musgrave, as yet under age ; Eden-hall is in the possession of his mother Lady Musgrave, relict of the late Sir John Chardin Musgrave, Bart. The singularly curious glass vessel, called the Luck of Eden-hall, has been already spoken of. On the west side of the tower and in the south window of the parish church are the arms of Stapleton, Vipont, Musgrave, and Hilton. In the church is the grave-stone of William Stapleton, Esq. who married the heiress of Vipont, and died in 1457. There are several monuments of the Musgrave family.

Egremont in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, is an ancient market town, five miles from Whitehaven, and 302 from London. The barony of Egremont was given by Ranulph de Meschines, (who possessed the county of Cumberland by the grant of William the Conqueror,) to his brother William ; this William seated himself at Egremont, and built the castle k near the town, of which there are still some remains ; his only daughter and heir married Robert de Romeley, Lord of Skipton, whose daughter and heir Alice married William Fitz-Duncan, Earl of Murray, nephew of David King of Scots. Ciceley, one of the three co heiresses of Fitz-Duncan and Alice, married William de Gros, Earl of Albemarle, and inherited the barony of Skipton ; Alice was twice married but had no issue ; Amabel married Reginald de Lucy, and had two daughters, co-heiresses, married to two brothers of the Multon family. In the year 13001 the barony of Egremont was in moieties between Thomas de Multon and Thomas de Lucy, the latter having taken the name of Lucy from his maternal grandfather. The whole of this barony appears afterwards to have been in the Multons till it became divided among the sisters and co-heiresses of John de Multon, the last heir male of that family, who died in 1335 ; one of these married Thomas Lord Lucy, grandson of Thomas Multon, who took the name of Lucy as above-mentioned.

On the death of Duke Algernon in 1750, Sir Charles Wyndham succeeded to these titles and the Egremont estate, and on his death in 1763, was succeeded in both by George, now Earl of Egremont. In the Appendix to Nicolson and Burn's History of Cumberland, is printed a charter of Richard de Lucy, in or about the reign of King John, containing rules and orders, with the grant of certain privileges to his burgesses of Egremont. It appears that the burgesses were bound in time of war to defend Egremont Castle at their own cost with twelve armed men, and to clothe and maintain them upon credit during that time ; to grant an aid for knighting one of the Lord's sons and marrying one of his daughters, or for redeeming him or his heirs if taken prisoners. A burgess accused of robbing had a right to his trial by thirty-six men three times ; but on a fourth accusation was to be expelled the borough, and his goods and chattels to be seised to the use of the lord : the fines for assaults, &c. are defined : a burgess was not to pay the customary fine for fornication with the daughter of a coun tryman unless he had promised her marriage : exemption from toll, and some other privileges, are granted to the burgesses. The borough of Egremont sent members to parliament in the 23d year of Edward I. ; but this ancient privilege has never been restored. In the year 1300, Thomas de Multon and Thomas de Lucy claimed to have assize of bread, &c. and the chattels of felons condemned and beheaded throughout the whole land of Copeland ; a gadows at Egremont ; a market at that town on Wednesday, and a fair for two ' days at Lady-day, which market and fair had been granted in 1266.

Sea scales is now a farm-house. The church of Gosforth is a rectory, in the diocese of Chester, archdea conry of Richmond, and deanery of Copeland. The present patron is Sampson Senhouse, Esq. In the church-yard is a very curious ancient cross, which has been already noticed. This parish has been inclosed under an act of parliament passed in 18 10, by which lands were allotted to the rector in lieu of tithes. There are two fairs held annually at Boonwood in this parish, April 25. and Oct. 18 ; the former for horned cattle, the latter for foals and cattle : two acres of land were allotted for the purpose of holding these fairs by the act of 1 8 1 o. Greystock, in Leath ward, lies five miles from Penrith. It is divided into the townships of Berrier and Murrah, Little-Blencow, Greystock, Hutton-John, Hutton-Roof, Hutton-Soil, Johnby, Matterdale, Motherby and Gid, Mungrisdale, Threlkeld, and Water-Melock ; containing collec tively, according to the returns of 181 1, 459 houses and 2,132 inhabitants. Mr. T. Denton computed the inhabitants of this parish to be 2,510 in 1688.

Ralph, grandson of the last mentioned Ralph, assumed the name of Greystock. William de Greystock, his son, in 1353, had the King's licence for castellating his manor-house of Greystock r. Ralph, the last Lord Greystock of this family, died in the year 1486 ; his only son, who died before him, left one daughter, Elizabeth, who became heiress to the baronv, and married Thomas Lord Dacre of Gilsland. George, Lord Dacre, died without issue in 1568, and his sisters and co-heiresses married the two sons of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Philip, Earl of Arundel, and Lord William Howard. On the partition of the property, Lord Arundel had the Greystock estate s, which, after a long chancery suit, was adjudged to Charles, fourth son of Henry Lord Mowbray, (grandson of Philip, Earl of Arundel, above-mentioned,) pursuant to a settlement made by his father. Upon the death of Edward, Duke of Norfolk, in 1773, the dukedom devolved on Charles Howard, Esq. of Greystock, grandson of Charles above-mentioned, and father of the present duke, who, among his numerous titles, bears the ancient title of Baron of Greystock. Greystock Castle, which had been garrisoned for the King in 1648, was taken by a detachment of General Lambert's army in the month of June. Mr. T.

' The park at Greystock now contains upwards of 3000 acres, surrounded by a wall nine feet in height ; more than a thousand acres have been added to it since the year 1800, in consequence of the inclosure of the adjacent wastes. The plantations made in the park by the present duke, occupy about 375 acres. From one to two thousand head of deer, were generally kept in this park till within these few years ; they are now reduced to a small number. Gobarrow-park, on the Duke of Norfolk's estate, in this parish, extended three miles in length and one in breadth, on the north side of Ulswater, but the present duke has taken off two thirds, and con verted the land into farms, leaving the central part for red and fallow deer ; of the latter there are about 300 : the red deer, of which there are about a hundred, have a free communication across the water with Martindale- Chase, in Westmorland ; hunts on both sides the water, are occasionally held in the months of August and September, the deer being frequently pursued across the lake. The manors of Motherby, Matterdale, Grisdale, Water-millock, and Berrier and Murrey, are spoken of in a record of the reign of Queen Elizabeth as appendages of the manor u of Greystock. In the parish church are monuments of some of the barons of Greystock, and a gravestone of Dr. John Whelpdale, master of the college, 1526. The church of Greystock was made codegiate in 1382, by Alexander Nevil, Archbishop of York.

The cause was tried, and judgment given against the crown, on the ground, that the college had no common seal, and that the church had been made col legiate on the Pope's authority alone. In consequence of this decision it remains rectorial. The advowson was long attached to the manor of Grey stock. The late duke, when Charles Howard, Esq. sold it to Adam Askew, Esq. ; the Rev. H.

He wras author of a Discourse on Satan's Temptations, and several Treatises on Divinity. There is a Presbyterian meeting-house at Penruddock, in this parish, endowed with a field, let for 1 1/. per annum. The manor of Hutton-John, or Penruddock, in this parish, belonged for many generations to the family of Hutton. One of the sisters and co heiresses of Thomas Hutton, who died in the reign of Queen Elizabeth without issue, brought Hutton-John to a younger branch of the Huddlestons of Millom. The Huddlestons suffered much for their loyalty during the civil wars ; John Huddleston, second son of Andrew Huddleston, of Hutton-John, was instrumental in saving King Charles II. after the battle of Worcester ; he afterwards became his private confessor, and is said to have administered the sacrament to him on his death bed, according to the rites of the church of Rome. Andrew Huddleston, of Hutton-John, the first protestant of the family, was an active promoter of the Revolution. Hutton-John is now the property and residence of Andrew Huddleston, Esq. great grandson of Andrew last-mentioned. The manor of Hutton- John, alias Hutton-Soil, was purchased in 1787 by the Duke of Norfolk, of Mr. Huddleston, who retained the demesne. An act of parliament for inclosing lands within this manor, was passed in 1813. The manor of Johnby belonged formerly to the Musgraves of Hayton ; an heiress of a younger branch of this family brought it to the Wyvills, by whom it was sold to William Williams, Gent. ; one of Mr. Williams's co-heiresses brought it to Sir Edward Hasell, of whose descendant, Wil liam Hasell, Esq. this manor was purchased by the Duke of Norfolk in 1783.

Little-Blencow, in this parish, gave name to an ancient family, by whom it was long possessed. In the year 1358 King Edward III. granted to Adam de Blencowe all the lands in Greystocke, Blencowe, and New biffpinff, which had belonged to John Riddall*. The manor of Blencowe and Blencow-hall, the old seat of the family, were purchased of the im mediate descendant of the family, Henry Prescot Blencowe \\ Esq, in 1802, by the Duke of Norfolk. There are four chapelries in the parish of Greystock, Water-Millock, Matterdale, Grisdale, and Threlkeld. There was a chapel at Water-midock, as early as the reign of Edward III. This appears to have been rebuilt about 1558, and then called Newkirk ; from this time the chaplain had licence from the bishop to baptize and bury at Water-millock. The chapel has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. Dr. Joseph Brown, born at Water-millock in 1700, published in 1726 a fine edition of Cardinal Barbarini's Latin poems, with a life of the author. The school at Water-millock has an ancient endowment of 5/. per annum, given by some person or persons now unknown.

The Rev. Robert Grisdale built a school-house at Matterdale, and endowed it in 1722, with the interest of 200/. In 1723 Mrs. Elizabeth Grisdale gave a small library, chiefly books of divinity, for the use of the chapelry. The village of Threlkeld lies on the road between Penrith and Keswick, at the foot of the mountain of Saddleback, which is in the chapelry. The manor belonged at an early period to a family who took their name from the place. Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, the last heir male, left three daughters, one of whom brought Threlkeld to the Pickerings. It was sold to the Lowther family before the year 1632, and now belongs to the Earl of Lonsdale.

The rector presents to the chapels of Matterdale, Grisdale, and Water-millock. The Earl of Lonsdale is the patron of Threlkeld. Grinsdale, in Cumberland ward, lies two miles and a half from Carlisle. This place gave name to an ancient family who held Grinsdale under the barony of Burgh. The elder line failed about King John's time, when the co-heiresses married Newton and Le-Sor z. Newton's lands passed by successive marriages to Martindale and Dacre, and having been forfeited to the crown, were granted to Whitmore, and passed by sale to Dacre of Kirklinton. This estate is now the property of Joseph Dacre, Esq. who is at present in the East Indies. A younger brother continued the male line of the family of Grinsdale, and some of his posterity represented the city and the county in parliament. This branch became extinct about the reign of Henry IV. when the co-heiresses sold their lands in Grinsdale to the Dentons, of whom they were purchased by the Lowthers about the year 1686. This estate now belongs to the Earl of Lonsdale, who is Lord Paramount of the manor, as parcel of his barony of Burgh. The church of Grinsdale was given by Hugh de Morville to the priory of Lanercost, and became appropriated to that monastery. King Edward VI. granted the rectory of Grinsdale to Sir Thomas Dacre ; the great tithes were sold by the Dacre family in 1751, to the respective landholders. Joseph Dacre, Esq. is patron of the perpetual curacy, which has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. The cnurch, which had been many years totally in ruins, was rebuilt about the year 1 743 by Joseph Dacre, Esq. at his own expence.

One of the coheiresses brought a moiety of it to the Ponsonby family in the early part of the fourteenth century, and they eventually became possessed of the remainder, which, in Richard the Second's time, continued in the representatives of the other coheiress2. Miles Ponsonby, Esq. died lord of this manor in 1814; it is now the property of his third son, William Ponsonby, Esq. of Gray's Inn. Sir John Ponsonby, ancestor of the Earl of Besborough, who went into Ireland with Oliver Cromwell, was of this family. The church of Hale was appropriated to the priory of Conishead in 1345. This parish has been inclosed under an act of parliament passed in 181 1, by which lands were allotted to the Earl of Lonsdale, as impropriator of the tithes. His Lordship is patron of the perpetual curacy. Harrington, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about four miles and a half from Whitehaven. This place was the inheritance and gave name to the ancient and baronial family of Harrington, which became widely branched and settled in various counties. The manor of Harrington is said to have been granted soon after the Conquest to the Talebois family ; but at an early period it passed to that of Harrington. The only daughter of William Lord Harrington married Thomas Grey Marquis of Dorset. On the attainder of his son, Henry Duke of Suffolk, the manor of Harrington was granted by Philip and Mary to Henry Curwen, Esq. ancestor of John Christian Curwen, Esq. the present proprietor. The demesne is within the inclosure of Workington Park. The church which is rectorial was given by the Talebois family to the abbey of St. Mary in York. Mr. Curwen is the present patron. It is in the diocese of Chester, archdeaconry of Richmond, and deanery of Copeland. The port of Harrington has a considerable trade, chiefly in coals and lime, exported to Ireland and Scotland. There are at present about 40 vessels belonging to this port, averaging 122 tons. In the summer months about 500 sloops take in lime at Harrington : the lime is burnt at Dissington, and brought down in carts. A school-house has been lately built at Harrington by J. C. Curwen, Esq.

The manor of Little-Corby, in this parish, belongs to Henry Howard, Esq. of Corby. The church was given by Robert de Vallibus to the prior and convent of Carlisle, and became appropriated to that monastery. The dean and chapter are now appropriators and patrons of the perpetual curacy, which has been twice augmented, by lot, by Queen Anne's bounty. An act of parliament for inclosing lands in this parish passed in 1807. Hesket, sometimes called Higher-Hesket, and sometimes Hesket in the Forest, to distinguish it from Hesket-Newmarket, lies in Leath ward, on the road from Penrith to Carlisle, at the distance of about nine miles from each. It is divided into the townships of Upper and Nether- Hesket, Pes tered Crook, and Plumpton Street and Cawthwaite ; containing together, in 181 1, 227 houses and 1,205 inhabitants. The greater part of the parish is within the Duke of Devonshire's manor of the Forest of Inglewood, pur chased in 1787 of the late Duke of Portland, whose ancestor acquired it by grant from the Crown. The forest courts are held yearly on St. Barnabas Day in this parish, in the open air, at a tree called Court-Thorn, by the road-side between Upper and Nether-Heskett. At this place the inhabitants of above twenty town ships* attend, out of whom a jury is ballotted and sworn. Here are paid the annual dues to the lord of the forest, and other customary payments. The commons of this parish have been inclosed under the act of 1803, for inclosing the forest of Inglewood. Armathwaite Castle, in this parish, was for several generations the seat of the Skeltons, who appear to have been originally of Skelton, and frequently represented the county and the city of Carlisle in parliament.

Near Aiketgate is a small lake or tarn called Tarn Wadling, covering about 1 00 acres of land, belonging to Mr. Milbourne. On a lofty eminence near this tarn were, some time ago, the remains of a fortress, called Castle Hewen, thus spoken of by Leland : \" In the forest of Ynglewood, about six miles from Carluel, appere mines of a castle call'd Castel Lewen.\" The neighbouring tenants pay a yearly rent to Mr. Milbourne as lord of the manor, called Castle Hewen rent.d In the parish church is the monument of Bernard Kirkbride, of Ellerton, Esq. the last of an ancient family, who died in 1677.

Holme-Cultram, in the ward of Aderdale below Derwent, is divided into the townships of Abbey Quarter, East- Waver Quarter, Low Quarter, and St. Cuthbert's Quarter; containing collectively, in x8n, 451 inhabited houses and 2,438 inhabitants. Abbey-town, in which is situated the parish church, is six mdes from Wigton. In the year 1 150, Henry, son of David King of Scots, being at that time Prince of Cumberland, founded at Holme-Cultram an abbey for monks of the Cistertian order, to whom he gave two-thirds of the manor of Holme- Cultram, having given the other third to Alan, son of Waldieve, as a chase for hunting : this third part Alan soon afterwards gave to the Abbey. King Henry II. being possessed of the county of Cumberland, by the cession of Malcolm, took the abbey into his protection, and having confirmed the grant of Holme-Cultram and other lands, was recognized by the monks as their patron. Ample revenues were afterwards given to this abbey by various persons ; and its abbot, though not mitred, was occasionally summoned to parliament5. It was at this abbey, in the month of October 1300, that King Edward I. in person released the Bishop of Glasgow from his imprison ment, and received his allegiance with much solemnity, in the presence of the Bishop of Carlisle, the abbot, and the French envoys \\ This abbey was pillaged by the army of Alexander, the Scottish King, in 1216'; and again in 1322 by Robert Bruce, notwithstanding, as the historian observes, his father's body was there interred k.

It was purchased of William Burton, Esq. of South-Luffington, in the county of Suffolk, in the year 1732, by Edward Stephenson, some time governor of Bengal, and is now the property of Edward Stephenson, Esq. of London, grandson of his first cousin. The rectory, which had been appropriated to the monastery, was granted by Queen Mary (after the death of Abbot Borrowdale, to whom it had been given in lieu of a pension,) to the university of Oxford, by whom it is granted out on lease. The university are patrons of the vicarage. An act of parliament for inclosing the parish of Holme-Cultram was passed in 1806. The parish church, which formed part of the conventual church, has under- gone sundry repairs since the dissolution, in consequence of accidents which are recorded in the parish-register. In the year 1600, the steeple being 19 fathoms in height, suddenly fell to the ground, and by the fall destroyed great part of the chancel ; Sir Edward Mandeville, the vicar, and another person, being in the church, escaped unhurt. The chancel was rebuilt, but had scarcely been completed, when it was set on fire by accident, and both that and the body of the church burnt down. When Dr. Waugh was ap pointed chancellor, in 1727, he found both church and chancel in a very ruinous condition, and by his exertions both were put in a complete state of repair in 173 1.

In 1301 the abbot procured a grant from the bishop for building a church there, and making it a separate parish, but soon afterwards, most probably before 1303, the town was washed away by the inroads of the sea. In 1303 Bishop Halton granted a licence to the abbot to build a church or chapel within their territory of Arlosh, which in consequence of the removal of the town thither, acquired the name of Newton- Arlosh, and in 1304 the abbot petitioned parliament that he might have at this place the market and fair which had been granted him at Skinburness ; this petition was granted\".

In this reign the manor of Hutton was sold to Sir Richard Fletcher of Cockermouth, who removed his residence to Hutton ; his son, Sir Henry, created a baronet in 1 640, was killed at the battle of Rowton-heath, near Chester, fighting on the King's side, in 1645 5 n^s widow and family were ad sent prisoners to Carlisle, but were after a time released, and his heir suffered to compound for his estate. Sir Henry Fletcher, grandson of the first baronet, embraced the Roman catholic religion, and died a bachelor in the early part of the last century, in a convent of English monks at Douay : the title by this event became extinct. Sir Henry bequeathed Hutton to Thomas Fletcher, Esq. of Moresby, a remote relation, (and first cousin on the mother's side.) Sir Henry's sisters commenced a suit in chancery for the estate, which was at length compromised, it being agreed that Thomas Fletcher should enjoy Hutton and some other estates for life, and if he died without issue, (which was the event,) that Henry Fletcher Vane, Esq. second son of Catherine, eldest sister of Sir Henry Fletcher, by her deceased husband Lionel Vane, Esq. should have and enjoy the whole. Henry Fletcher Vane dying without issue, his brother Walter succeeded to the estate, and took the name of Fletcher: in the year 1786 his son Lionel Wright Vane Fletcher, Esq. was created a baronet, and was father of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, the present baronet, and possessor of the Hutton estate. The hall is the occasional residence of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, Bart. The small manor of Morton, in the northern part of this parish, belongs to the Duke of Devonshire. In the parish church is an ancient gravestone for one of the Hutton famdy, and some monuments of the families of Fletcher and Vanew. The dean and chapter of Carlisle are patrons of the rectory of Hutton, which is in the deanery of Allerdale. The church was rebuilt about the year 1714; it had been given to the priory of Carlisle by Robert de Vallibus. The commons of this parish were inclosed under the act of 1803, for inclosing the forest of Inglewood.

The parish of St. John's, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about one mile and a half from Calder-bridge, where is a post-office, and about eight miles from Whitehaven. The manor of Little Beckermet, or Beckermont, in this parish, has belonged for several centuries to the Fleming family, and is now the property of Sir Daniel Fleming, Bart, of Rydall, in Westmorland. Yerton-hall, in this parish, is the property of Mr. Henry Gaitskell, and is now occupied as a farm-house. The church was given by the Flemings to Calder Abbey, and in 1262 was whody appropriated to that monastery. The Rev. Henry John Todd is the present impropriator and patron of the perpetual curacy.

The parish is divided into the townships of High and Low-Ireby, containing together, in 181 1, 87 houses, and 399 inhabitants. The manor of High-Ireby was given by Alan, son of Waldieve, Lord of Allerdale, to Gospatric, son of Orme ; a younger son of Gospatric assumed the name of Orme de Ireby, and was ancestor of two families of that name. William de Ireby, the last of the elder branch had two daughters, married to Estoteville and Lascelles, in the reign of Henry III. This manor was inherited by Lascelles, and passed by marriage to Seaton. Christopher Seaton, son of the heiress of Lascelles, was attainted for taking part with Robert Bruce. At a later period this manor belonged to the Barwis family, of whom it was purchased by an ancestor of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, Bart, the present proprietor.

It was acquired of the Boyvils by William de Ireby, a younger brother of the family before-men tioned. Christian, daughter and heir of this William, married Thomas, the son of Duncan Lascelles, and afterwards Robert Bruce. This lady conveyed Low-Ireby to Thomas Middleton, from whom it passed to the Tilliols.

The church of Ireby was given by Alan, Lord of Allerdale, to the prior and convent of Carlisle. This parish has been inclosed under an act of parliament passed in 181 1, by which lands were allotted to the dean and chapter of Carlisle, or their lessee, in lieu of tithes. The dean and chapter are patrons of the perpetual curacy, which, although still a small benefice, has within the last five years been twice augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. The priory had two estates in this parish, Isaacby, or Prior's-hall, and Newbiggin, formerly caded a manor: Newbiggin is now a grange belonging to the dean and chapter; Prior-had is divided into leasehold tenements held under the dean and chapter.

Levers dale was for some generations the property of a family who took their name from the place. Near the church is the keep of a castle, which probably was the seat of some of the family of Vaux or de Vallibus, for one of whom there is an ancient grave-stone in the parish church. It is said to have been the chief seat of the barony of Gilsland before Naworth Castle was built. The church was given by Robert de Vallibus to the priory of Lanercost, to which the great tithes were appropriated. They were granted, together with the advowson of the vicarage, by King Edward VI. to Sir Thomas Dacre. Joseph Dacre, Esq. is the present patron and impropriator. Castlesteads and Watch-cross, the two Roman stations, already more particularly spoken of, are in this parish. There is a school at Irthington, endowed with the interest of 200/. one hundred of which was given in 1792, by James Hetherington, the other in 1795, by Jane Dalton. Irton, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies about sixteen miles from Whitehaven. The manor has belonged almost from the time of the conquest to the ancestors of Edmund Lamplugh Irton, Esq. of Irton hall, the present possessor. The manor of Santon, in this parish, belonged in the reign of Henry III. to Alan de Copeland, of Bootle, in whose family it continued several descents. It is now the property of Mr. Irton. Holme-rook, in this parish and manor, was the seat of the late Admiral Lutwidge, who sailed round the world with Captain Cooke, now of his nephew Major Skeffington Lutwidge. The church of Irton, which had been appropriated to the nunnery of Seaton, was granted on the dissolution to the Penningtons.

The manor of Isel was given by Alan, son of Waldieve, to Ranulph Engain, whose grand-daughter brought it to the Morvils. Ada, coheiress of Hugh de Morvil, one of Thomas-a- Becket's assassins, married to her second husband, Thomas de Multon. Margaret, the heiress of Multon, brought Isel to the Leighs in the reign of Edward II. Thomas Leigh, Esq. the last heir male of this family, gave the manor of Isel to his wife Maud, (who had been widow of Redmain) : this lady gave it to her third husband, Sir Wilfred Lawson, great uncle of Sir Wilfred Lawson of Isel, who was created a baronet by King James II. in 1688. Upon the death of Sir Wilfred Lawson, Bart, in 1806, the title be came extinct ; and the Isel estate, under his will, is now the property of Wilfred, a younger son of Thomas Wybergh, Esq. who has taken the name of Lawson : he is as yet under age. Isel Hall, the seat of the Law^sons, an ancient mansion, with a square tower, situated in a beautiful vadey on the river Derwent, has been many years deserted by the Lawson family, whose chief residence has been at Brayton-had. Redmain, in this parish, was given by Alan Lord of Allerdale to the priory of Gisborne. After the Reformation it was granted to the Curwen family, who continued to possess it in 1688 c : it is now part of the Lawson estate. At Chapel-guards were some time the ruins of buildings, of which there are now no remains : it is probable there might have been a chapel there dedicated to the Holy Trinity ; the adjoining grounds are demesne lands called the Trinities, belonging to the Lawson estate. Chapel-guards is the property of Allan Pearson, Esq. of Bridekirk. Redmain was the birth-place of Dr. Joseph and Dr. Bolton Simpson, two eminent classic scholars. Dr. Joseph Simpson, who was born in 1710 and died in 1796, rector of Weyhid in Hampshire, published an edition of Epictetus, which went through several editions ; the Choice of Hercules by Pro dicus; Characters of Theophrastus, &c.

Kirk-Andrews on Eden, in Cumberland ward, lies three mdes and a half from Carlisle. This parish is part of the barony of Burgh d, belonging to the Earl of Lonsdale. The rectory is united to Beaumont, and is in Lord Lonsdale's patronage. There has been no church in this parish for many years, but the parishioners still bury their dead in the cemetery. The rectory belonged formerly to the priory of Marrick in Yorkshire. It is said that there was formerly a church at a place called Kirksteads, about a mile south of the village of Kirk- Andrews, where there is still the appearance of a church-yard. This parish has a share of the interest of 50/. bequeathed by Mr. Thomas Pattinson, in 1785, for the purpose of educating the chd dren of the poor of Beaumont, Kirk- Andrews, and Grisdale. Kirk- Andrews upon Esk, in Eskdale ward, on the borders of Scotland, lies about two miles from Longtown, and eleven from Carlisle. It is divided into the townships of Kirk-Andrews-Middle, Kirk-Andrews-Nether, Moat, and Nichol-forest ; containing altogether, in 181 1, 367 houses and 2,086 inhabitants. The whole of the parish is within the barony of Liddell, already described, belonging to Sir James Graham, Bart, of Netherby. The moat, supposed to have been the ancient site of the barony, is in this parish, but has been already spoken of under Arthuret e. The parish church was rebuilt in the reign of Charles I. by Sir Richard Graham, on the site where the church of Kirk-Andrews, long before demolished, had stood, on the banks of the Esk : this was done under the authority of letters patent from the King, which define the boundaries of the restored parish, comprising a part of the depopulated parish of Eston, the remainder being in the parish of Arthuret. The advowson of the rectory belongs to Sir James Graham, Bart. Not far from the church is one of the border towers, built as a protection against the hostile inroads of the Scots. * Mr. T.

The mischief at first seemed almost irreparable ; but by the spirited exertions of Dr. Graham, who was landlord of the whole inundated tract, the ground was gradually cleared, at a great expence, and again brought into cultivation ; and there is now not a trace of this extraordinary inundation to be seen.

This Sir Hugh had a charter for a market in the reign of King John, on Thursday, and a fair on the feast of St. Oswald \\ From the Morvils this manor passed by descent to the Dacres, and with the barony of Dacre of the south, to the Fynes's and Len nards. The coheiresses of Thomas Lennard, Earl of Sussex, sold it to Sir Christopher Musgrave, Bart, of Eden-hall, ancestor of Sir Philip Mus. grave, Bart, the present proprietor. The manor of Little-Crogiin has been long annexed to that of Kirk-Oswald. There are but small remains of the ancient castle of Kirk-Oswald, said to have been built by the Engaynes. It was improved by Sir Hugh Morvil, who inclosed the park ; Thomas de Multon enlarged and fortified it ; Thomas de Dacre, who married the heiress of Multon, beautified it at a great expence. We find Thomas Lord Dacre frequently residing at Kirk- Oswald in the reign of Henry VIII. z Mr. Sandfbrd, who wrote an account of Cumberland about the latter end of the seventeenth century a, speaks of this castle as \" the fairest fabric \" It is a remarkable circumstance, that the eminent instrument-maker of the present day, who has lately invented and constructed the mural circle for the same observatory, is also a native of Cumberland, having been born in the parish of Corney. 1 Cart.

After the death of Thomas Fletcher of Moresby (the last of the family), it was sold (under a decree in Chancery), in 1720, to John Brougham, Esq. of Scales, by whom, in 1737, it was conveyed to Sir James Lowther, of Whitehaven, Bart., ances tor of the Earl of Lonsdale, who is the present proprietor.

Ineffectual attempts at constructing a harbour at Parton were made by the Fletcher and Lamplugh family in 1680 and 1695 : the proceedings being stopped by an injunction from the court of exchequer. In 1 695 Mr. Lam plugh was adowed to repair the small old pier. An act of parliament foi enlarging the pier and harbour of Parton passed in 1 705 ; another act for rebuilding the pier and harbour passed in 1724 ; and a third act, for enlarging the term of that last-mentioned, in 1732. Several vessels were employed in the coal-trade here till the year 1795, when the pier was washed away by an unusually high tide, and has not since been rebuilt. Muncaster, in the ward of Allerdale above Derwent, lies near the sea, about 1 6 miles south of Whitehaven, The original name of this place was Meolcastre, Mealcastre, or Mulcaster, from a castle which was the ancient residence of the lords of the manor at Esk-meal, near the mouth of the Esk, between the mountains and the sea. The manor is known to have belonged to the Pennington family as early as the reign of Henry II. Sir John Pen nington, who lived in the reign of Henry VI. is said to have secreted that unhappy monarch at Muncaster in his flight from his enemies ; and the tra dition of the famdy is, that on quitting Muncaster he presented his host with a smad glass vessel, still preserved in the family, and called the Luck of Muncaster, to the preservation of which a considerable degree of super stition has attached. This Sir John Pennington is said to have been a distin guished military character, and to have commanded the left wing of the English army in an expedition against Scotland. His grandson, Sir John Pennington was in the battle of Fiodden-field. Another descendant of the same name, was admiral to King Charles I. and much trusted by that monarch in naval affairs. Sir William Pennington, grandson of the last mentioned Sir John, was created a baronet in 1676. Sir John Pennington, the fifth baronet, was in 1783 created Lord Muncaster of the kingdom of Ireland ; he died in 1 8 1 3, leaving only one surviving daughter, married to Lord Lindsay, son of the Earl of Balcarras, when the title of Muncaster, and the Muncaster estate being settled on male heirs, devolved to General Lowther Pennington, now Lord Muncaster. Muncaster Castle, which retains the principal tower of the ancient for tified mansion, though it has lost its original form, was nearly rebuilt by the late Lord Muncaster.

The manor of Newton belonged in the reign of Henry II. to the famdy of de Regny, whose descendant in the reign of Edward I. left four daughters coheirs. In the same reign we find this manor in the possession of Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and Wells', who in 1239 conveyed it to Hugh de Lowther, ancestor of the Earl of Lonsdale, who is the present proprietor. This was one of the earliest possessions of the Lowther family in Cumberland. The old mansion on this estate is occupied as a farm-house. The manor of Catterlen belonged at the time of the conquest to Hudlan, whose son forfeited it in the reign of Stephen ; King Henry II. granted it to Hubert de Vallibus, or Vaux, after which it continued many genera tions in a younger branch of that ancient family g. John Vaux, Esq. the last of this branch, left two daughters, married to Richmond and Graham of Nunnery. This manor passed to the Richmonds, and under the wdl of Mrs. Susannah Richmond to J. C.

The old mansion of Catterlen-had, built by Rowland Vaux in 1577, has long been in a dilapidated state, and occupied as a farm-house.

Ousby, in Leath'ward, under Crossfell, lies eight miles from Penrith. The manor was at a very early period divided into moieties : in the reign of Henry III. these moieties were in the family of Falcard and Armstrong, shortly afterwards one of them was split into four, between coheiresses. The estate has remained ever since in severalties, in the families of Crack enthorp and others, but the manerial rights seem to have been centered by purchase or otherwise, in that of Crackenthorp, and W.

The manor or honour of Penrith, which had been ancient demesne of the crown, was in the year 1 242, assigned to Alexander, King of Scotland, with other manors ', in pursuance of an agreement made at the conference holden at York in 1237, when Alexander consented to cede all claim to the counties of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland, for himself and his successors, in consideration of a grant of lands of 200/. per annum value, to be holden of the King of England, by the annual render of a falcon to the constable of the castle at Carlisle. m John Baliol succeeded to these manors, but in the quarrel between him and King Edward I. they were seized and given to Anthony Bee, Bishop of Durham : the parliament, which was held at Carlisle, disapproving the grant, it was revoked, and these manors reverted to the crown. In the year 1345, the Scots with a large army entered Cumberland, burnt Penrith, and carried away great numbers of the inhabitants prisoners. The manors of Salkeld and Sowerby also were laid waste in revenge for their having been taken from John Baliol. In the year 1380 the Scots surprised Pen rith during the time of the fair, put many of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried off many prisoners and a great booty n. It appears by our historians, this town had been peculiarly obnoxious to the Scots, and had been burned in 1342 and in 1345. \u00b0 King Richard II. granted the manors of Penrith, &c. to John Duke of Britanny and Earl of Richmond ; two years afterwards he granted them to Ralph Nevil, Earl of Westmorland, and his heirs male, to be held in as ample manner as they had been by Alexander King of Scots. It is probable that about this time Penrith Castle was built by the Nevils, as a protection to the town, against any future attacks of their hostile neighbours. By the death of Richard, Earl of Warwick, who was slain at Barnet Field, and died without issue male, the manor of Penrith reverted to the crown, and was immediately granted by King Edward IV. to his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard III. It has been said that the Duke of Gloucester resided at Penrith for the purpose of taking effectual measures for the security of the county of Cumberland against the Scots, and indeed there seems little doubt of it, for we find that the duke was sheriff of the county for five successive years, and he is described as of Penrith Castle.

There are considerable remains of Penrith Castle, which stands on an eminence to the west of the town. It is supposed to have been built by the Nevils, and enlarged and repaired by the Duke of Gloucester. We have not found any positive account that Penrith Castle was occupied as a garrison during the civil war ; it is probable that it was held by General Lambert, whose head-quarters were at Penrith from the middle of June tid the middle of July 1 648 p. The castle was dismantled after the war, and the lead, timber, and other materials sold. Penrith Beacon, on the summit of the Fed, overlooks the town, and commands a most extensive prospect, closed in on every side by mountain scenery. Within the parish of Penrith are the following subordinate manors, Bishop's row, belonging to the Bishop of Carlisle ; Penrith, Hutton-hall, and Carleton. The mesne manor of Penrith belonged to the Hutton family of Hutton-had from the reign of Edward I. till it was sold by Addison Hutton, M.D. the last of the family q in 1734, to John Gaskarth, Esquire, whose son in 1790, sold it to the late Earl of Lonsdale. It is now the property of the present Earl. Hutton-had is in the occupation of John Orfeur Yates, Esq. Mr. T.

Carleton was the residence of the family of de Carleton, nearly as early as the time of the conquest. On the death of Robert Carleton, Esq. the last of this ancient family, in 1707, the manor, which had been purchased probably of Lord Burlington or his heirs, was sold to John Pattinson, Esq. On the death of his son without issue, it became the property of his eldest daughter, who married Thomas Simpson, Esq.

A tablet in the church states, that in the year 1598, 2260 persons died of the plague u : there must have been some mistake in this ; it appears by the parish register, that only 583 persons died in the parish of Penrith of the plague.

This revenue, after the reformation, continued some years in the crown, till Queen Elizabeth, at the instance of her secretary, Sir Thomas Smith, then Dean of Carlisle, founded anew the grammar school, and endowed it with the above-mentioned salary. In the year 1661 William Robinson, citizen of London, gave a rent charge of 10/. per annum to the school. William Bleamire, Esq. in 1782, gave a rent charge of 61. per annum, and one pound to the vicar, for preaching a sermon on education. The whole revenue of the school, including some smaller benefactions, does not exceed, about 26/. per annum 7, and the school, which was formerly in much repute as a classical seminary, has in consequence of the smallness of its endowment fallen much into decay. It is entitled in its turn with other Cumberland schools, to an exhibition at Queen's Codege in Oxford.

It was afterwards parcel of the possessions of Andrew de Hercla, Earl of Carlisle, and having been vested in the Crown by his attainder, was given to Robert de Eglesfield by King Edward III. in exchange for the manor of the Hide, in Laleham, (Middlesex). Eglesfield, in 1 341, settled it upon his newly founded college at Oxford, to which, in compliment to Queen Philippa, he had given the name of Queen's College. The church of Renwick was appropriated to the monastery of Hexham ; but it afterwards belonged to the abbey of St. Mary at York. Mr. Wdliam Lowson is said to be the patron of the perpetual curacy, but the patronage appears to be in the Crown, and the Crown has generally presented to it by lapse ; indeed the advowson appears to have been reserved to the Crown by the patent of 20 Eliz. unless there has been any subse quent grant. The benefice is very small, although it has been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty, aided by a benefaction of 200 /. from the Countess dowager Gower. The church was rebuilt in 1733.

Sir Henry Curwen, sold the third part of Bothill, which belonged to his family, to the Barwises of Ilekirk, whose heiress brought it to the Dentons, and the Dentons sold it to the Salkelds. Bowet's share is said to have been conveyed by Sir Nicholas Bowet to William Ellis, whose grandson sold it piecemeal to the tenants, but in 1807 William John Carlton, Esq. representative of the Salkelds, claimed to be sole lord of this manor, and his claim was allowed by the commissioners. Mr. Charlton has since sold the demesne lands, called Bothill Parks, to John Raney, Esq. of Whitehaven.

The church of Torpenhow was given by Sibella de Valoniis and Eus tachius D'Estoteville, to the prior and convent of Rossdale, in Yorkshire, to whom it was appropriated ; but by an award made in the year 1290, by Bishop Irton, the glebe, &c. of Torpenhow, and the great tithes of Tor penhow, Threapland, Aldersceugh, Applewray, Snittlegarth, Bellasis, and Bowaldeth, were assigned to the vicar, for the maintenance of three priests and one sub-deacon : some of these tithes were granted by Queen Elizabeth in 1562, to Cicely Pickrell, and the remainder, in 1574, to John Sonky and Percival Gunson. These tithes belonged to the vicar till the late inclosure act, under which lands were given in lieu of them. The tithes of Bothill and Blennerhasset, which were reserved to the priory of Rossdale, were granted to the Salkelds, and were held till lately with the Whitehall estate. Under the inclosure act an allotment was given in lieu of the tithes of Bothill. Mr. Chaiiton has sold the great tithes of Blennerhasset to Mr. Hodgson, of that place ; the small tithes belong to the vicar of Torpenhow. The great tithes of the manor of Kirkland belong to the land owners. In 1 807 an act of parliament passed for inclosing lands in the manors of Torpenhow and Bothill ; in 181 1 an act for inclosing those in the town ship of Threapland (Threapland-town Green excepted); and in 18 14 an act for inclosing lands in the manor of Bowaldeth.

Ilekirk, in this parish, had its name from the hermitage of Saint Hilda, which having before belonged to Roger the hermit, was given by King John to the abbey of Holme-Cultram. King Henry VIII. in 1543, granted the hermitage of Hildkirke or Ilekirk, with all the lands thereto belonging, to Thomas Dalston, Esq. who the next year conveyed it to Anthony Barwis, Gent.

Ranulph de Meschines, in the year 1088, founded at Wetheral a priory of Benedictine monks, as a cell to the abbey of St. Mary at York. This priory was surrendered in the year 1539, when its revenues were valued at 117/. 11 s. io^d. clear yearly income. In the year 1541, King Henry VIII. granted the site of the priory and the manor of Wetheral, with several other manors and lands, to the dean and chapter of Carlisle, and by a subsequent grant he gave them the rectory and advow son.

The population of the town, from the influx of weavers from Ireland and Scotland, has been for many years progressively increasing. In Hutchinson's History, published in 1794, Wigton is said to have increased greatly within the twenty years then preceding ; and it is added, that it was then supposed to contain 1,700 souls. In 1801 the number of persons in the township of Wigton appears to have been 2,166. In 181 1, according to the return made to parliament, the parish of Wigton contained 2,977 persons.

Working ton-hall, the seat of Mr. Curwen, stands on a finely wooded eminence over looking the river Derwent ; the old mansion, of which there are scarcely any traces, was castellated pursuant to the royal licence granted by King Richard II. to Sir Gilbert de Culwen in 1379.\" Mr. Denton, speaking of Workington-hall says, \" I do not know any one seat in all Britain so commodiously situated for beauty, plenty, and pleasure, as this is. The demesne breeds the largest cattle and sheep in ad the country. The famous salmon fishing here (mentioned in Camden,) is worth 300/. per annum, three hundred of those great fishes having been frequently taken at a draught. They are likewise plentifully stored here with very good sea fish and fowl, and here is a large rabbit-warren, worth 20/. a year, besides what serves the house, and a great dove-cote, stored with a huge flight of pigeons ; a salt pan and codiery, worth 20/. per annum, within the demesne.\" Workington-hall has been nearly rebuilt by its present owner, from the designs of Mr. Carr of York, and the grounds greatly extended and improved. When the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots fled to this country as an asylum, she landed at Workington stem a fishing boat, on the 16th of May 1568 ; the next day she addressed a letter from this place to the Queen. Mary attempted at first to conceal her rank, but certain gentlemen of the county understanding who she was, waited upon her and conducted her to Cockermouth \u00b0. There is a tradition that she was lodged at Work ington-hall during her short abode on the coast. The manor of Clifton was given by William de Meschines to Waldieve, son of Gospatric, and passed by successive female heirs to the families of Lucy, Eglesfield, Berdsey, and Salkeld. By the latter it was sold to Sir James Lowther, Bart, and is now the property of the Earl of Lonsdale. There are two large weekly markets at Workington, Wednesday and Saturday, for butchers' meat and other provisions. Corn is sold only on the Wednesday, which is the principal market day. It does not appear that the markets are of ancient origin. There are two cattle fairs, but not of much note, May 18th and October 18th. The increase of population at Workington has been very great, but we have no means of ascertaining its progress. In Hutchinson's history the Pat.

Hutch inson's statement must have been erroneous (for houses it is probable was meant families) : the population appears to have been gradually in creasing. The average of baptisms for ten years, ending with 1800, was about 170 ; for the ten years ending with 18 10, 191. The chief trade of the place consists in the exportation of coals, which are sent in considerable quantities from Mr. Curwen's coal pits to Ireland. The chief manufactures are those of sail cloth and cordage, and every thing connected with the shipping. There is a considerable salmon fishery in the Derwent, in which the Earl of Lonsdale and Mr. Curwen have an interest. The ship-building trade is very prosperous ; vessels of from four to six hundred tons, copper bottomed, are built here, and sold to the mer chants of Liverpool, Cork, &c. &c. This town has an assembly room, built by Mr. Curwen, a theatre, &c. In the parish church is the monument of Sir Patrick Curwen, Bart, who died without issue in 1661. In the church-yard is the tomb of the Rev. Wil liam Thompson, who raised and formed a society of Protestant dissenters (Presbyterians) in Workington, and collected funds for building a meeting house, of which he was pastor for 40 years : he died in 1782, aged y^- The advowson of the rectory was given by Ketel, son of Eldred, to the abbey of St. Mary at York. In the year 1544 the grantees from the crown sold it to Thomas Dalston, of whose family it was purchased in 1563 by the Curwens, and it has ever since been held with the manor. The townships of Workington and Winscales have been inclosed by virtue of an act of parliament passed in 1809. Allotments of lands were made to the rector, to Mr. Curwen as lord of the manor, and to the latter and Thomas Harrison, Esq. for a certain portion of tithes in Win scales. There appears to have been a chapel also at Workington, granted, with certain lands attached to it by Queen Elizabeth in 1574, to Percival Gunson and John Sonkey. There was formerly a chapel at Stainburn belonging to the prior and convent of St. Bees, who had a manor-house there, which was burnt by the Scots in 13 15 p.

In 1 8 1 2 an act passed to inclose the township of Stainburn and in 18 14 for inclosing those of Great and Little-Clifton. Under both these acts allotments of land were given in lieu of tithes. There is a Catholic chapel at Workington, and meeting-houses for the Presbyterians and Methodists. The school at Workington was founded by Sir Patrick Curwen, and endowed by his brother, with a rent-charge of 8/. per annum. Mr. Curwen has lately succeeded in a chancery suit, by which he has recovered this endowment, his ancestors having had no right to alienate or charge the lands so disposed of they having been strictly entailed. There is a large school for boys, and another for girls, on Mr. Lancaster's plan, patronized by Mr. Curwen ; a Sunday school belonging to the esta blishment, aud another to the Methodists.
