He was dressed in a tartan coat and waistcoat, green spectacles and wig, and a Tam o' Shanter bonnet. When playing in the streets, he endeavoured to preserve the strictest disguise, he never stood nor solicited money, but received any sum that was given to him. According to receipts in his book, he had given upwards of \u00a3700 to charities, in different towns he had been at.

The Rev. J. Orange, formerly minister of the independent church at Barnsley, was installed pastor of the congregation assembling in St. James' chapel, Blackett-street. February 13. \u2014 An affray took place in the Shades public house, Grindon-chare, in Newcastle. A travelling Italian had gone into the house and joined a party who were drinking, when some words took place, which produced a scuffle, and the Italian, being likely to be overpowered, drew his knife and stabbed an Irishman named Hugh Ross, in the abdomen. He was at once taken to the Infirmary, where he lingered until the 18th The Italian, Guiseppe Sidoli, was tried at the assizes on the 23rd of the same month, and was sentenced to seven years' transportation for manslaughter.

One ofthe men, on coming up to him, asked him the time of night, when the four instantly closed upon him, knocked him down and rifled his pockets. The thieves immediately leaped a gate into a field, and were followed by Buddie and his dog, which attacked the fellows, and must have bitten them severely. The men ran across the field, followed by Buddie, until they came to a burn, into which two of them fell. On coming up, he grappled with them, when a dreadful scuffle took place, during which two shots were fired at him and his dog, but, happily, without effect. He was severely beaten about the head. The robbers escaped at the time, but were afterwards taken and tried at Newcastle assizes, before Baron Bolland, convicted, and sentence of death recorded against them, but the sentence was afterwards commuted to penal servitude for life. Mr. Buddie, however, for his courageous and manly conduct, was presented with a splendid watch, and \u00a319 Os. 8d., the money he lost. May 1. \u2014 A discussion, between the Rev. John Lockhart, of Newcastle, and Mr. Borthwick, the hired advocate of the slave holders, took place in the Music Hall, Blackett street, William Chapman, esq., in the chair. The discussion lasted several hours, when the show of hands was greatly in favour of immediate abolition. May 4. \u2014 A fire broke out in the cabinet workshops of Mr. Thomas Sopwith, situated in the Painter-heugh, Newcastle, which were entirely consumed, together with a quantity of mahogany veneers, and all the tools of the workmen. It is not known how the conflagration originated, which was first discovered about ten o'clock, and increased with alarming rapidity, owing to the com bustible nature of the materials exposed to its operations. The mayor evinced the most laudable anxiety, stimulating the firemen by his directions and also by his personal exertions. The fire was got under about half-past eleven. Mr. Sopwith's stock and premises were insured. May 5. \u2014 Omnibusses were first established to run between Newcastle and Tynemouth. May 8. \u2014 A young man named Lawson, a native of Alnwick, was bathing in the river Coquet, near Brinkburn, when he got out of his depths and was drowned. A companion, named Henderson, belonging to Morpeth, plunged in to rescue him, but he likewise sunk, and a third, who attempted to save the others, narrowly escaped the same fate. May 15. \u2014 Newcastle and the surrounding country, to a great extent, was visited with an awful storm of thunder, lightning, hail, and rain. The atmosphere at the north-west assumed a threatening aspect early in the day, but it was not until five o'clock"], [10, "HIRTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1833. 4 in the afternoon that the storm commenced. At that period a dense cloud settled over the town, the thunder was loud in the distance, and the explosions of the electric fluid, principally what is called \"forked\" lightning were so continuous as almost to resemble one unbroken sheet of flame for upwards of a minute. The rain began to descend gradually under a heavily charged atmosphere, with scarcely a breath of air. Suddenly, the wind increased almost to a hurricane, and the thunder gave startling peals, accompanied by a tempest of rain and hail such as is seldom witnessed in England. The hailstones were of an unusual size, and the damage done was very great. Seventy-four panes of glass were broken in the dome of the Royal Arcade. At Bensham upwards of a thousand squares were broken, in Ravensworth terrace, two hundred and twenty. The vineries at Ravensworth castle sustained the damage of \u00a3400 or \u00a3500. In the hothouses at Redheugh 2,070 squares were demolished. The storm did not reach the north part of Northumberland on the 14th, but on the 18th a storm passed over Alnwick, when the lightning struck the tower of the church and did material damage. At Shieldykes a horse was killed, and at Chillingham and Lilburn a great deal of damage was done by the hailstones, many of which measured upwards of four inches in circumference ; they were mostly in the form of irregular pieces of ice, It is somewhat singular that at Summerhill and Westgate scarcely a single hailstone fell. At Sunderland the storm raged with much violence, and did great damage to the hothouses and dwelling houses in the town and neighbourhood. A house in Bishopwearmouth was struck by lightning and a female killed. At Durham and neighbourhood the storm was also very severely felt, and had, as in other places, destroyed several hundreds of squares of glass. A poor man, residing at Waldridge Fell, was struck by lightning and instantly killed. His wife and children were in the house at the time, but did not receive any material injury. May 15.\u2014 As Mr. Tindale, a respectable farmer at Edlingham, was returning from the rent day at Capheaton, he was thrown from his horse, near the garden house, Waliington, and unfortu nately had his neck dislocated, which caused immediate death. On Saturday, an inquest was held on his body, at Waliington New Houses, and a verdict of accidental death returned. May 18.\u2014 Henry Fawcett, scholar of University College, aged 20, fourth son of the late Rev. John Fawcett, Newton Hall, Dur ham, was drowned while bathing in the river Isis, near Oxford in company with three other gentlemen members of the same college.

May 28. \u2014 Being his majesty's birthday, it was ushered in by the ringing of bells and the firing of cannon. The Newcastle troop of dismounted cavalry mustered at the parade ground, and marched to the Sandhill, where they fired a. feu de joie, they were afterwards presented with wine by the mayor and magistrates to drink his majesty's health. The Scotch Greys and artillery stationed at the barracks were reviewed on the moor, and the day passed off with the usual demonstrations of joy. In the other towns round about similar expressions of loyalty were manifested. May 29. \u2014 Twizell house, the seat of P. J. Selby, esq., was this day the scene of a joyous occurrence, Miss Selby and Miss Frances Selby were both led to the hymeneal altar \u2014 the former by Charles J. Bigge, esq., of Linden, and the latter by Edmond Antrobus, esq., son of the Eev. Mr. Antrobus, rector of Acton, MiddleEex, and of St. Andrew's, Undershaft, London. The brides were most beautiful, their dresses were lace over white satin, orange chaplets and white veils. An appropriate triumphal arch was erected at Twizell gate under the tasteful management of Captain Mitford, R.N., composed of evergreens interspersed with lilacs, &c. The cortege to Bamburgh church was splendid. While the party were at church, the servants and villagers were hand somely entertainment at breakfast, a barrel of ale was drunk at the gate, and many a cordial wish was expressed for a blessing on the nuptial rites. After breakfast the bridal parties set off in their carriages, the one for Dunstanhiil, near Newcastle, and the other for the Brae, near Jedburgh. The day was fine, and will long be remembered on account of the lively feeling experienced by all the neighbourhood for the prosperity of the family at Twizell. May 30. \u2014 Thursday, an accident happened to Mr. Adamson, of the city of Durham, veterinary surgeon. He was in the act of preparing some medicine for a horse, and had put a quantity of nitric acid and oil of tar into a quart bottle, when, from the accumulation of gas, the latter exploded, and wounded Mr. Adamson in the side ; a large piece of glass was afterwards extracted. Two horses belonging to the Hon. and Rev. Dr. Wellesley were leaving the shop at the time of the accident ; one of them received a deep wound in the thigh from the broken glass, and the servant was thrown against the wall by the force of the explosion. June 8. \u2014 The Eppleton colliery, belonging to the Hetton Coal Company, was won.

June 19. \u2014 h. melancholy accident happened at the Short Sands, on the north side of Tynemouth Castle. About nine o'clock in the morning, Mr. John Smith, of Winlaton, and Mr. Hodgson, draper, Gateshead, went to bathe, and unfortunately got out of their depths and were drowned. Their bodies were almost immediately taken out, but life was extinct. Mr. Smith was a single man, but Mr. Hodgson left a wife and six children to lament his untimely end. June 21. \u2014 Three young men, William and Robert, sons of Mr. William Cuthbertson, of Newton Sea Houses, Northumberland, and Ralph Archbold, left that place in a boat for Dunstanborough castle, to gather sink stones for the boat nets. On their return a heavy squall caught the sail \u2022and capsized the boat, which immediately sank, from the quantity of stones it contained. Robert, who could swim a little, seized hold of two oars, and contrived to keep himself in that position until he was taken up by two fishermen ; but his less fortunate brother and companion were both drowned. Their bodies were found the following day. Cuthbertson was 22 years of age, Archbold 1 9. July 16. \u2014 A most magnificent brick-built chimney having been completed by Mr. Livingston at the alkali works of Anthony Clapham, esq., Friar's Goose, on the Tyne, a little below Newcastle, Mr. Clapham, on the above day, entertained a party of friends with a sumptuous repast at the bottom of the chimney, to the. great delight of his friends, who expressed their surprise and astonish ment at this stupendous work of art. It was then the highest chimney in England, being 263 feet from the base, exceeding in height that of Muspratt's famous chimney at Liverpool by 38 feet, and St. Nicholas' steeple, Newcastle, by 69 feet. It is 27 feet in diameter at the base, and 7 feet at the top, which is finished by a stone coping. It contains upwards of half-a-million bricks, and is computed to weigh nearly 2,000 tons. July 20.\u2014 As John Kelly was descending the shaft of Hetton pit a large piece of deal fell from the top upon him. The shock threw him out of the loop, but his foot catching a chain in his descent, he was suspended with his head downward until he reached the bottom of the shaft. He was seriously injured. About this time there was discovered, a little to the eastward of the ancient church at Norham, the foundation of a building which appeared to have consisted of a number of very small apartments, the purpose for which has not yet been ascertained, but it is supposed to have been a kind of penitentiary for the punishment of refractory monks."], [13, "A.D. 1833.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 7 1833 (July 2b). \u2014 Thursday morning, early, a fire broke out in a small brewery, occupied by Mr. J. Armstrong, as a malting, situ ated in a passage leading from Sandgate to the New-road, Newcastle. In a short time the whole building was in a blaze, and although the Newcastle and North British fire engines were promptly on the spot, the brewhouse was entirely consumed. The premises belonged to Mrs. Renoldson, and were insured. July 28. \u2014 The whole of an extensive building, occupied by Mr. Mark Thompson as a raff yard, Pandon, Newcastle, fell to the ground with a tremendous crash, about six o'clock on the morning, in consequence of an immense quantity of railway bars having been placed against the wall next the street. Pandon is a common thoroughfare, but fortunately no accident happened. July. \u2014 Dr. Bedale, of swimming celebrity, exhibited his aquatic feats in the river Tyne on two occasions during the last week of this month. Many of his positions and movements were very beautiful and scientific. Large crowds attended each day to witness the novelty of the exhibition. August. \u2014 Early in this month two remarkably large swarms of flies were noticed at North Shields, proceeding from the sea in a westerly direction. On one of the occasions an opportunity was taken of estimating the height of the mass, which appeared to be about 21 feet by 8 or 10 in breadth. It was several minutes in passing by the observers. August 1 . \u2014 Wednesday, the neighbourhood of Newcastle was enlivened by the firing of guns and other tokens of joy, at the loading of the first vessel with coals from the low main seam at St. Lawrence colliery, near Newcastle, called Picton Main. The pit was begun from the surface on the 3rd of December preceding, and was completed to the the low main, a depth of 93 fathoms, in the short period of eight months. The seam is in great perfection, is six feet thick ; and, as a proof of the spirit of the parties, notwith standing that the coal work was only commenced on Monday, they raised on the following day upwards of 120 tons of coal. August 1 9 \u2014 For some years past nearly all the moors in Northumberland had been taken possession of by large bodies of poachers from the adjoining counties, who not only carried away immense quantities of game, but even plundered the industrious farmers of their sheep, and did wilful damage to their property. The overbearing insolence of those lawless intruders so intimidated the peaceful inhabitants, that they almost might be said to have lost their right over and control of their own property. The 12th of August (the commencement of the shooting season) was again marked by the arrival of large bodies of these intruders, upon which the gentlemen and farmers then shooting on the moors determined no longer to be annoyed by them. Accordingly, on the above day, they divided themselves into two parties, and having ascertained that a body of the poachers would commence shooting at a place called Whitelee, near Carter Bar, the first party, consisting of about forty persons, on horseback, set out"], [14, "[a.d. 1833 8 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF from Woodburn about three o'clock on the morning of the 20th, the second party also setting out for another suspected place ot rendezvous. On the arrival of the first party at Whitelee, they discovered about twenty poachers ranging the moors, each armed with a gun, and attended by a dog. Immediately on being dis covered, the poachers formed themselves into a military position on the ascent of a hill, threw off their coats, and, presenting their guns, threatened to fire on the first who came near them. A young gentleman present remonstrated with the poachers on their illegal conduct, but in vain ; they declared they would not be taken, and would shoot the first man who approached them. Upon this the gentleman alluded to rode over a small burn which divided the parties, instantly followed by his friends, and after considerable struggling, in the course of which the young gentleman's horse was felled to the ground, and he himself severely wounded, the poachers were completely overpowered and brought before two magistrates, who committed them to Morpeth gaol under the game act. 1833 (Aug. 22;.\u2014 Died, in Ropery-lane, Sunderland, aged 102, Mr. James Hall, mariner. Same day, about half-past four -o'clock, when the tide was on the turn of ebb, Peter Duncan and James Blair were drowned at Hartlepool, on the North Sand, under the following circumstances : The two unfortunate men, privates in the Scots Greys, with a third, named William Wilson, having gone for the purpose of bathing, while the three were undressing, Wilson, observing there was a heavy swell on, proposed they should not go in, but Duncan and Blair, being good swimmers, persisted, while Wilson remained on shore to watch their clothes. When they were in about 80 or 100 yards, and swimming close together, a heavy sea burst upon them, and they sank Wilson, on their not re-appearing, gave the alarm, and assistance was procured ; but before the bodies could be found life was extinct. September 1. \u2014 The Ardincaple steamboat, on her voyage from Edinburgh to Newcastle, encountered a tremendous gale, such as had not been seen upon the coast for upwards of thirty years. When off Bambro' Castle she was struck by a heavy sea, which completely swept her deck and tore away the whole of the bulwarks, stanchions, and paddle- casing on the larboard side, carried over board Captain Macleod, the steward's daughter, a soldier, and two other passengers (one of them a young seaman, and the other a middle-aged man). Several other persons were overboard, but contrived to regain the vessel. Both anchors were let go, and she was brought up. Another sea then struck her, and the chimney and mainmast went over the side. Every exertion was made to clear away the wreck, and she bravely rode in the gale till near one o'clock the next morning. Too much praise cannot be given to a party of sailors who were on board, and to Mr. Pearson, late captain of the King of the Netherlands, who then took the com mand. The vessel was perfectly tight, but, from all the skylights on deck being broken in and the engine-house completely smashed"], [15, "A.D. 1833.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 9 away, a great deal of water necessarily got into the vessel. Having, however, an excellent copper pump on board, the sailors and the crew soon got the better of the water. During the day two of the crew lowered down the stern boat and jumped into her, when the painter broke, and they were in a moment swallowed up by the raging element. About one o'clock she was struck by another most tremendous sea, when she parted from both her anchors, both chain cables having broken, and it was then momentarily expected she would drive ashore. Very fortunately there were some large tarpaulins which had been used to cover the luggage upon deck, and with these they contrived to make a sail, and they had the satisfaction to find she was going off the land with them. They soon cleared her of the water she had shipped, and steered immediately for a good anchorage under the lee of the Farn Islands, where they saw several vessels lying in smooth water, and among the rest a revenue cutter (supposed to be the Mermaid), and notwithstanding guns were fired from the Ardincaple, the bell rung, and every exertion made, they inhumanly took no notice of the vessel, but suffered her to pass within a very short distance ; indeed she was in their view the whole of the preceding day. But a cod smack, which was riding inside the cutter, having heard the signals, immediately slipped her cables and came down to their assistance. About five o'clock they were taken in tow by the smack and the passengers were removed into her for safety. She was towed up by the smack to Shields, where she got into the harbour next morning. The passengers were all landed in the evening by the crew of a boat from Cullercoats, who, seeing her distress, gallantly put off, at the hazard of the lives, to their assistance. 1833 (September 3). \u2014 A most diabolical attempt was made on the night of this day, by setting fire to a house belonging to Lord Ravensworth, on Thrunton moor, not only to destroy the property, but to sacrifice the lives of the inmates. A reward ot twenty pounds was offered for the discovery of the perpetrators. September 6. \u2014 Four stacks of wheat, two stacks of hay, a stack of straw, a thrashing machine, a cow byre, and various other out premises, the property of Mr. Matthew Collins, of Monckton, in the parish of Jarrow, in the county of Durham, were wilfully set on fire and completely destroyed. Two hundred and fifty pounds reward was offered, and a free pardon to any accomplice, not having been the actual incendiaries, for the apprehension and conviction of the offender or offenders. September 18.\u2014 Twenty-five French boats engaged in the herring trade, were driven ashore on the coast near Newton-by-the- Sea, Northumberland ; twelve of them were got off, but the others became wrecks. Their crews, consisting of about 180 men, were all saved. Shaftoe Craster, esq., of Craster, with his usual benevolence, supplied them with both money and victuals, they also received, great hospitality and assistance from several other gentlemen of the neighbourhood, and were enabled to return to their homes.

Ur. Losh was bom at Woodside, near Carlisle, received his school education under the Rev. Mr. Gaskin, of Wreay, and afterwards under Mr. Dawson, of Sedburgh, from whence he removed to Cambridge, after which he entered Lincoln's Inn, and in due time was called to the bar. In 1797, he settled at New castle, and in the following year married Cecilia, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Baldwin, of Aldingham, Lancashire, by whom he left five sons and three daughters. In 1810, he greatly assisted in the establishment of the jubilee schools; subsequently he interested himself in the formation of infant schools, and in the beginning of the year of 1833, he ably advocated the scheme for a collegiate education at Newcastle, the friends of which have to lament his loss in a more special manner. The sensation excited by the event in this neighbourhood was great and extensive, all political differences appearing to have at once subsided, and every one feeling that society had lost an active, eminent, and useful member ; the public institutions, charitable, educational, and literary, a warm and enlightened supporter ; a numerous circle of friends, an intimate and kind associate, a judicious adviser, and a ready helper ; and to the poor a most liberal benefactor. His exertions to promote the education, particularly the religious education of the lower classes, were manifested at an early age. His remains were interred at Gosforth on the 3rd of October, and were followed to the grave by the mayor and corporation of Newcastle, the various members of the legal profession, the members of the literary and philosophical society, headed by Sir Matthew W. Ridley, bart., the mechanics' institute, the anti-slavery society, and followed by the members of the Unitarian congregation in Hanover-square, with whom the deceased had for many years been on terms of the most friendly communion. Several burgesses and corporate officers succeeded, and the procession was closed by twenty to thirty carriages. The crowds of respectable spectators on either side of the road were immense for the first three-quarters of a mile, and great numbers accompanied the procession to the church, where, about twelve o'clock, the body was received by the Rev. J. Walker, M.A.. incumbent. The interior of the church was crowded in every part, and its appearance had at this time a peculiarly solemn effect. After the usual preliminary services had been gone through, the whole assembly proceeded to the grave, where the remaining ceremonies were performed, and the tomb finally closed over one who when living was included amongst the greatest benefactors of this town and neighbourhood, aud to whom his relations and more intimate friends had, on this occasion, the melancholy satisfaction of seeing the public testifying, with one accord, their gratitude for his exertions, and their esteem for his memory.

Same day, an explosion of fire damp occurred at Black Fell colliery, near Chester-le-Street, by which three wastemen lost their lives, namely, Robert Forster, W. Lamb, and Stephen Campbell. November 5. \u2014 A party of visitors at Chillingham castle, accom panied by the gamekeeper, went into the park for the purpose of shooting one of the wild cattle, and while the keepers were recon noitering their position, one of the cattle made a sudden rush, when Barnes, the gamekeeper, unfortunately fell down, and the animal threw him twice over his head, and gored him very much. The infuriated animal was ultimately driven off by a deerhound, and despatched by a volley from the party. Barnes was conveyed home in a dangerous condition, and every attention paid him by the noble earl and his family. November 15. \u2014 A daring attempt at highway robbery took place in the evening of Hexham fair, on the person of a gentleman named Weddell, who was attacked near Chollerford by three footpads ; one of them seized the bridle of his horse, but was instantly knocked"], [18, "12 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1833. down. Another made a similar attempt, but shared the same fate. Mr. Weddell, not being able to get his horse to move, dis mounted, and after giving the robbers a severe beating, rode off; but, on arriving at Chollerford, found that his horse had been severely stabbed, apparently with a sword. 1833 (November 16J\u2014 Died, at Bagnalstown, county Kilkenny, aged 28, the Honourable Frederick George Howard, M.P. for the borough of Morpeth, Northumberland, captain of the 90th regi ment, and second son of the earl of Carlisle. On the previous day he left the barracks, near Kilkenny, in a curricle, accompanied by two of his brother officers, and was proceeding to visit a detach ment of the regiment quartered at Newtoubury. The horse, from some cause, took fright and ran away. Captain Howard, attempt ing to leap out, was thrown with great violence upon his head, which caused an effusion of blood on the brain. Captain Howard was promoted to a company the 10th of March, 1827. November 20. \u2014 The town of Morpeth, Northumberland, was lighted with gas for the first time, to the great satisfaction of the inhabitants. November 21. \u2014 A rare species of fish, known as the Sparus Deutrex, was captured in the Cambois burn, near Blyth. It measured 5 feet 6 inches in length, and weighed 79 lbs. November 22. \u2014 Died, at Fairshield, Northumberland, aged 101, Mrs. Margaret Brammer. On the same day, at an early houi in the morning, Mrs. McGregor, whose husband was in the service of Mr. Abbott, ft Gateshead, was delivered of a daughter on board the Ardincaple steamer, while she lay at anchor under Dunstanborough castle. In commemoration of the occurrence, the child was christened Elizabeth Ardincaple Dunstanborough McGregor. November 23. \u2014 An explosion of fire-damp took place at the Low Moorsley pit, near Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham. Mr Appleby, viewer ; Mr. Dawson, overman ; and four men were dreadfully burnt. November 23. \u2014 Died, at Byker Buildings, aged 103, much re gretted, Mrs. Elizabeth Wallas. November 27. \u2014 John Gibson, engineman at Wideopen colliery, about five miles from Newcastle, lost his life by the bursting of a boiler, about nine o'clock at night. There were two other boilers alongside the one which burst, neither of which were much injured. The boiler which exploded, weighing six to seven tons, was blown to some distance. December 9. \u2014 Died, at the Shaws, near Hexham, aged 90, Mr. John Charlton. It is somewhat remarkable that his mother, Eleanor Charlton, died at the age of 99 ; her sister, Elizabeth, at 102 ; their brothers\u2014 John Robson, at 102 ; and Mr. James Robson, 94: united ages, 397. December 10.\u2014 The large bell, bequeathed to the parish of St. Nicholas', Newcastle, by the late Major Anderson, was hoisted up to the belfry. The diameter of the bell across the mouth is six"], [19, "A.D. 1834.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 13 feet five inches ; its length inside, from top to bottom, is four feet ten inches ; its total weight is about seventy-two cwt. The bell was cast at the foundry of Sir Robt. Shafto Hawks, and Co., by James Harrison, of Barton-upon-Humber. On the preceding Thursday, the bell was christened by Mr. Harrison, the founder, previous to its removal to the church, on which occasion a party of twenty of the workmen were comfortably seated within the bell, where they drank three gallons of ale, after which ten others entered it, making thirty persons within it at the same time. The name given to the bell was \" The Major.\" Whilst in the porch of St. Nicholas', a shoemaker made the greater part of a shoe in it on Monday afternoon. 1833 (December 19;. \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred at the buildings erecting by Mr. Grainger, at Leazes-terrace, Newcastle. While six of the workmen were walking along the scaffolding, at a considerable height, with a large head-stone, one of the supporters gave way, by which means they were all precipitated to the ground. William Murray was killed on the spot ; Robert Cunningham died shortly afterwards at the Infirmary ; a third had his leg broken ; another his thigh bone, and the two others severely bruised. It did not appear that blame could be attached to any one for the calamity. December 23. \u2014 A hare was killed in Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, by the hounds belonging to Mr. J. G. Clark. It was put up behind Kenton lodge, ran thence to Gosforth, thence to the Grand Stand, afterwards across the Moor into Pilgrim-street. December 23. \u2014 Robert William Brandling, esq., of Low Gosforth, near Newcastle, obtained a patent for improvements in applying steam and other powers to ships, boats, &c. 1834 (January 1.) \u2014 Early this morning, the body of an old woman was found in the ditch adjoining the Newcastle race course. The deceased was in the habit of travelling round the villages in the neighbourhood, collecting rags, and was well known by the name of \" Radical Betty ;\" and it was supposed that, during the preceding evening, she had been returning to her residence in Sandgate, and, from the inclemency of the weather, perished on the moor. January 8. \u2014 Died, at North Shields, aged 103, Elizabeth, widow of Mr. Thomas Hill, mariner, formerly well known under the appellation of the \" lady wife,\" she being the person who gave information to the seamen's wives, on the arrival of their husbands at Shields bar. She was married at the age of 17, and lived some years in London during the reign of George II. She survived her husband 58 years. January 10. \u2014 The servant of Mr. Angus, farmer, at Hindly, between Newcastle and Hexham, was crossing the Tyne with a cart and two valuable horses, they were carried away by the violence of the stream, which was much swollen by the late rains, and lost in the sight of several individuals, who could not render them any assistance."], [20, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1834. 14 1834 (January 11.;\u2014 Died, at Monkwearmouth, aged 100, Mrs. Margaret George. January 14.\u2014 A large party of poachers were discovered in the immediate vicinity of Ravensworth castle. The Honourable H. T. Liddell and a few servants sallied forth to endeavour to drive them off, when they were violently attacked by the poachers, who were all armed and in military training, each man answering to a number. The butler had a very narrow escape for his life, but John Bell, farm servant to Lord Ravensworth, was severely wounded in the hip and groin, of which he afterwards died. It is only proper to say, Mr. Liddell and his party had no arms. A reward was offered for the discovery of the depredators. January 15. \u2014 Died, in the Tuthill-stairs, Newcastle, aged 65, Mr. William Fifefield, a man of colour, and a native of the West Indies. He had resided in that town nearly forty years, and had filled the situation of drummer in various local regiments. He was afterwards the owner of a \" comfortable,\" plying between Newcastle and Shields, and was well known and respected in both towns. January 16. \u2014 Tbe first cargo of coals from Crowtrees' Wallsend colliery was shipped at the Clarence Railway Company's station, at Stockton, on board the brig Elizabeth, for London. January 21. \u2014 Early this day, a large quantity of farm produce was destroyed by fire in two separate farmyards, near the village of Offerton, in the county of Durham, beloDging to Mr. Thomas Elliott, of that place, farmer. On the alarm being given, the whole of the inhabitants of the village, as well as those of Hilton, were thrown into the greatest consternation, and a message was despatched to Sunderland for assistance. A detachment of military was immediately sent off with the fire engine kept at the barracks, which arrived about six o'clock, and shortly after, the two Sunder land parish engines, as well as one from Lord Durham's colliery, reached the spot, but, unfortunately, too late to save the property from destruction, the whole, consisting of eighteen corn stacks and three large hay stacks, being consumed. The manner in which the stack, which communicated flame to the others, had been fired, little doubt of its being the work of an incendiary. His majesty's pardon and a reward of three hundred pounds were offered for the discovery of the offenders. January 21. \u2014 The Earl of Durham, with his usual hospitality, being Provincial Grand Master of that county, invited the whole fraternity of the province to dinner at Lambton Castle. The brethren of the different local lodges assembled in the library and picture gallery at twelve o'clock, and at half-past twelve the grand lodge was opened in the saloon, which was fitted up by Sir Cuthbert Sharp, as Deputy Provincial Grand Master, who rose on behalf of the assembled brethren, and, in very appropriate terms, presented the noble earl with a splendid gold medal, ornamented with masonic emblems set in brilliants, as a mark of the deep sense they enter tained of his lordship's services, aud their admiration of his public"], [21, "A.D. 1834.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 15 and private character. The noble earl acknowledged the tribute in an address of considerable length, replete with the warmest expressions of kindness and regard. A splendid suite of apartments in the castle, the gardens and conservatory, were all thrown open for the accommodation and entertainment of the company, and his lordship, accompanied by his countess, promenaded on the terrace, conversing in the most affable manner with the guests. At a late hour the brethren took their leave, highly delighted with the urbanity of the noble earl, and his unwearied assiduity in promoting their comfort and gratification. 1834 (January 28). \u2014 Newcastleand the neighbourhood was visited by a severe storm of wind and rain, as were all the western parts of the county. From the circumstance ofthe Tyne risingtoan enormous height and overflowing its banks, the whole of the district below Blaydon, including Derwenthaugh, Scotswood, Dunston, &c, was completely under water, and in many of the houses it was nearly up to the second floor. At the time of high water at Newcastle in the evening, the Close and the Quayside were completely flooded, the water extending on to the Sandhill and a considerable distance up the Broad-chare. Many cellars and warehouses in those parts were filled with water. January 30. \u2014 Another case of the destruction of farm property occurred at Offerton. Since the former fire, on the 21st of this month, Mr. Burnip, the proprietor ofthe stacks now destroyed, had kept a constant watch by night over his property, until the 29th, when he desisted, imagining that the high reward offered for the apprehension of those concerned in Mr. Elliott's conflagration, would deter others from committing a similar act. He accordingly retired to rest at his usual hour, but awoke between one and two o'clock in the morning, and not feeliDg satisfied, he determined on perambulating his farmyards, which he did, and all appearing to he safe he returned to his bed ; but shortly after three o'clock Mr. Burnip was aroused by a loud knocking at his door, and on looking out discovered that one of his stackyards was in flames. All classes at once rendered the most prompt assistance in their power, but had it not been for the immediate assistance rendered by an engine from one of Lord Durham's collieries, the whole of the farm buildings must have been destroyed. The loss of property never theless, was excessive, including 8 stacks of wheat, 4 of oats, 2 of tares and beans, and 2 of hay. It was stated that a light had been seen by a cottager on the opposite side of the Wear, about three o'clock in the morning, moving from stack to stack. The circum stance of two fires of such magnitude occurring in the same vicinity in so short a time, produced a great sensation in the neighbour hood, and a very strong feeling on behalf of Mr. Burnip and his son, who were highly respected by all who knew them. February 5. \u2014 The 21st anniversary of the Society of Anti quaries of Newcastle was held at their apartments in the building of the Literary and Philosophical Society. Mr. Adamson read the report, which embodied an account by the Rev. John Hodgson,"], [22, "16 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1834. secretary, of the excavations carried on at the expense of the society, aided by a voluntary contribution, in the Roman station Borcovicus, at Housesteads, in the years 1830, 1831, and 1833, and of the researches made by the Rev. A. Hedley at his station of Vindolana, or Little Chesters, and by the late Mr. Crawhall, at Amblogama, or Burdoswald. The members afterwards dined in their library, which was tastefully fitted up for the occasion with the armour in the society's museum, to which Mr. Falla kindly added some beautiful specimens belonging to him. About twenty five dined, Sir Charles Monck in the chair ; Mr. Adamson acted as his vice. It was a true antiquarian feast, and the evening was agreeably spent. 1834 (February \\\\). \u2014 Died, at his seat of Mainsforth, aged 55, Robert Surtees, esq., M.A., F.S.A., and the historian of the county of Durham. Mr. Surtees was born in the city of Durham, and after passing his youthful years at Houghton-le-Spring grammar school and Christ Church, Oxford, he entered the Temple in 1800, but on the death of his father, in 1802, before he was of standing to be called to the bar, retired to Mainsforth, and he relinquished his connection with the profession, and almost immediately commenced the compilation of his history, the first volume of which was pub lished in 1816, the second in 1820, the third in 1823, and the fourth and last volume not having been wholly arranged at the time of his death, was not given to the world until 1840. The biographical sketches in his History of Durham evince the kindli ness of the author's disposition, and the pedigree and descents of property his laborious research, while the notes disclose the luxuriance of his own imagination, together with an extensive cultivation of the polite literature of ancient and modern times. Towards the neighbouring poor, by whom he was much beloved, he often carried his consideration to a fanciful refinement. He would frequently drop small sums of money on the road, and enjoy the notion of the unexpected pleasure that the next poor per son passing by would feel in acquiring them, unencumbered with the debt of gratitude. He extended his sympathies to the brute creation, and in his love for dogs was a successful rival of his friend, Sir Walter Scott. His manner was generally distinguished by courtesy and consideration, but false pretension of any sort he could not bring himself to tolerate, and unlucky was the man who, in his presence, ostentatiously affected to know more than he did, for, besides that, he was unusually ready in wit and sarcasm; it might bo said of him, on such occasions, as was said of Dr. Johnson, that if his pistol missed fire, he would knock you down with the butt end of it. He was buried, 'midst the tears of the surrounding poor, on the 15th of February, 1834, in the churchyard of Bishop Middleham, where an elegant monument has been erected to his memory by his widow. February 14.\u2014 This day, an old woman, named Jane Gordon, arrived at the Mendicity office, Newcastle, after travelling from her native place, Linlithgow, in Scotland, to Toworth, near"], [23, "A.D. 1834.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 17 Bawtry, in Yorkshire. She was 100 years of age, and had per formed the task three times in the last three years ; but in this, her last attempt, she failed. In June, 1823, she walked upwards of 400 miles, at an average of eighteen miles a day. Her case being made known to several charitable individuals, a sum wa9 soon raised to clothe and send her home. Mr. Radtord, one of the proprietors of the Turf Hotel coach office, generously gave her a free passage to Edinburgh. She had been a widow 54 years, and received an allowance the last twenty, from her husband's native place, in Yorkshire. 1834 (February). \u2014 This month, Mr. Bowes, of Chapel-row, near Bishop Auckland, having been annoyed by the occasional stopping of his clock, sent for a clock-maker, to ascertain the cause, when it was found that a mouse had built her nest among the works, where she was actually rearing a young litter. February 14. \u2014 Died, at his house, in Albion-street, Newcastle, the Rev. Henry Deer Griffith, incumbent of St. Andrew's, lecturer at St. Nicholas', and chaplain to the Trinity House. In the death of this gentleman, the public had to deplore the loss of a very amiable and accomplished man, and a most able and eloquent minister of the established church. In life he was beloved and respected ; he died esteemed and regretted by all who knew him. February 15. \u2014 The miners employed at the Monkwearmouth colliery penetrated through the main seam of coal, which is six feet nine inches in depth, and 264 fathoms from the surface. February 26. \u2014 Wednesday, about four o'clock, the bark mill occupied by Mr. Jonathan Priestman, situated in Low Friar-street, Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire. The engines of the New castle and North British fire offices, and those from the barracks, were speedily in attendance, but from the strong wind which was then blowing at the time, and the height which the fire had reached before assistance could be procured, all hope of saving the premises where it first originated was abandoned. Every effort was there fore directed to prevent the dreadful conflagration from spreading, which was successful. The loss of property, however, was very considerable. March 3. \u2014 Thomas Drummond, of Biddick, county of Durham, pitman, was declared by a respectable jury, at the Court House, Edinburgh, to be lawful male heir to his grand uncle, John Drummond, only brother to James Drummond, last earl of Perth, commonly called Duke of Perth. Mr. Drummond afterwards pub lished his case, claiming the title and estates of the earls of Perth, and attempted to prosecute his claim before the committee of privi leges of the House of Lords, but not being able to raise the neces sary funds proved one if not the chief obstacle to his success. The earldom was likewise claimed by the duke de Melfort, and was eventually obtained by him in 1853.* March 15. \u2014 Died, at South Shields, aged 100 years, Mrs. Alice Scott. * An interesting account of the above may be had of T. Fordyce. VOL. III. D"], [24, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1834. 18 1834 (March 15). \u2014 Saturday, at night, between twelve and one o'clock, a young man, named Masterman, a cooper in Newcastle, was assisting an acquaintance, named Waddle, to his residence at the South Shore, near Messrs Hawks and Co.'s factory, he was accosted by three men when near Blackwall paper mil), and knocked down by one of them with what resembled a broken oar, and robbed of a sovereign, four shillings in silver, and his watch. His hat was found next morning near Redheugh. He was so dreadfully dis abled that he could not move, and after being exposed to the cold several hours, was found between six and seven in the morning, with his pockets turned inside out, and on being removed home, was in such a precarious state, that Mr. Alderman Shadforth attended on Sunday evening, with Mr. J. Brown, and took his deposition. Waddle was also robbed, but not seriously injured. On the Monday, three young men were taken upon suspicion, viz., Benjamin Bramwell and Martin Lennox, smiths, and John Pybus, an apprentice to a builder. After undergoing an examination, they were remanded until Wednesday, when they were again brought before the mayor and magistrates. Bramwell gave a voluntary account of himself, and such further information as implicated his companions, and warranted the magistrates in committing them for trial. At the assizes, held at Durham in. the month of August following, Lennox and Pybus were found guilty of highway robbery, Bramwell being admitted king's evidence. March 20. \u2014 A fine vessel, of about eight keels burden, and the only one ever built above the Tyne bridge, was launched at Chat ham, in the presence of a large assemblage of spectators. She was called The Frolic, aud intended for the Baltic trade. March 22. \u2014 During a heavy gale of wind, a new chapel, which was building at Monkwearmouth for the Baptists, was blown down. On the same day, a portion of the lead on the roof of the Natural History Society's building in Westgate-street, Newcastle, weighing upwards of a ton, was al*o blown down, and fell on the top of the adjacent workshops of Messrs. Dotchin, cabinet makers, and did con siderable damage March 24. \u2014 About four o'clock in the morning, Ayton House, near Berwick, the seat of J. Fordyce, esq., was discovered to be in flames, and the family and domestics just escaped with their lives almost in a state of nudity. A messenger was immediately sent to Berwick, but before the engine could arrive, a great part of the roof had fallen in, aud furniture, library, &c., were destroyed. By the exertions of the firemen, the kitchen, cellars, and one of the wings of the house were saved. Everything else was consumed. The fire was supposed to have originated in one of the servant's rooms, where she had left a candle burning. The furniture, &c were insured in the Sun and Ph\u0153nix offices to the amount of* JbOjOOO. March 27.\u2014 As George Johnson, in the emnloy of Messrs Robson and Fletcher, drysalters, Newcastle, was driving a cart of goods down to the carriers, a hackney coach, driven by Thomas"], [25, "A.D. 1834.] REMARKABLE EVENTS., 19 Forster, unfortunately ran against him wish such violence as to bring him in contact with the shaft of tbe cart, which was standing in the street, and to c^use three of his ribs to be broken ; he lay on the footpath for some time as if dead. The man who drove the hackney coach, was conveying a person to Durham, who had a broken leg ; and, strange to say, as soon as he had driven the coach to Durham, he complained himself of being ill, requested to be taken to his son's house, and died the following morning. 1834 (March 28). \u2014 The following melancholy event took place at Low Buston, near Warkworth : A cow, roused by some boys, attacked a female who was driving her, and tossed her several times over her head, and continued to gore her for some minutes, notwithstanding the efforts of several individuals who were attracted to the spot, and had much difficulty in extricating the poor woman from her perilous situation. She was, however, removed to a house, and found to be much injured, and in a dangerous state. Another woman, an eye-witness to the accident, and who had gone to her assistance, died immediately afterwards, from the effects of the fright. March 30. \u2014 Mr. William Gallon, of Wooler, innkeeper, when digging a drain to conduct water into his court-yard, from the Water Company's pipes in the street, found a large stone trough of a singular shape, being wide at one end and narrow at the other, full of rich black mould, with a small quantity of white earthy substance resembling adipocere, of very offensive odour, from which circumstance it was thought to be an ancient stone coffin, one end of which was close to the foundation of his house, the latter being nearly 800 years old. April 9. \u2014 The dead body of a woman, named Ann Lumsden, was found upon the sea-shore at Hendon, near Sunderland, supposed to have been murdered. A man, named Thomas Hodgson, was fully committed to take his trial upon the charge, but was honourably acquitted at tbe Assizes, held at Durham in the following August, April 1 6. \u2014 Died, at Bedlington, North Durham, aged 104, Mary, widow of Mr. Robert Gallon. April 31. \u2014 Charles May, a clerk in the office of a solicitor in Newcastle, was fully commiited for trial at the Assizes, on a charge of stealing 174 volumes, and a great number of prints, which had been torn out of books, all belonging to Dr. Thomlin son's Library in St. Nicholas' church, in that town. May was transported for seven years May 6. \u2014 An elegant new barge, for the use of the right worshipful the mayor and corporation of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was launched from the buildins<-yard of Messrs. John Oliver and Son, boat-builders, South Shields. May 12. \u2014 A fire broke out on the premises belonging to Cresswell Baker, esq., at Hareup-Hill-Enc!, near Bewick, in the county of Northumberland, occupied by two farm-servants, which consumed the whole of the building, together with a quantity of"], [26, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1834. 20 corn that was in the granary, also three wheat stacks, and a large hay-rick. The fire originated in the chimney. 1834 (May 8.)\u2014 The ancient custom of perambulating the boundaries of the river Tyne, of which the Corporation of New castle are the Conservators, took place to-day. Considerable pre parations had been made, in order to give proper effect to the aquatic procession, particularly by the stewards of the incorporated companies, who, in testimony of their approbation of the general conduct of Henry Bell, esq , the mayor, unanimously resolved to join the procession. They engaged the steamer \" Swan,\" and had it superbly decorated and fitted up for their reception. There was also in the procession a keel, rowed by twenty-four oars, beautifully decorated. The mayor and the river jury sported new barges, expressly made for the occasion ; and when the procession started from the Mansion-house at six o'clock in the morning, the spec tacle was indeed a very imposing one. On arriving at Shields the party went on shore, and partook of a sumptuous breakfast. After passing the usual boundary, the procession returned to Newcastle, and landed at the Mansion-house, where, during a brief stay, refreshments were partaken of, and the party again went on their journey to Hedwin Streams, the western boundary of the Con servators. At this place the usual festivities were kept up On the return journey a halt was made at the King's Meadows, where horse-racing and other sports were indulged in. A party of strangers erected a' booth on the island, which they termed \" The Liverpool Club House,\" supposed for the purpose of gambling, and evidently purposed making a rich harvest out of the occasion. They were, however, in this respect, wofully disappointed, as the booth was torn to threads by the populace, and thrown about the green ; and it was rumoured that the speculators were losers to the amount of about \u00a320. Two very serious accidents occurred during the day \u2014 one to a sailor who was rigging a flag in honour of the occasion, and the other to a man who was firing cannon, and who had his hand severely injured \u2014 but beyond this a very enjoyable day was the result of the outing. May 13. \u2014 A petition was presented to the house of Commons from the neighbourhood of Houghton-le-Spring, praying for the repeal of the export duty on coals. May.\u2014 The church of St. Nicholas had a new north porch and but.resses erected, to correspond with those on the south. May 15, \u2014 The upper part of the Stanhope and Tyne Railway extending from Stanhope to Annfield, county of Durham, a distance of about sixteen miles, was opened. A party of gentlemen left Annfield at eight o'clock in the morning by a railway waggon, tastefully fitted up for the occasion, and arrived at the termination of the line about eleven, highly gratified with the whole line of road, but especially with that part of it which crosses the precipi tous ravine called the Hownes. At one o'clock the first four lime waggons were started from the spacious range of Kilns belonging to the company, and speedily ascended the steep inclined plane"], [27, "A.P. 1834.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 21 adjoining Stanhope, amidst the cheers of an immense crowd of spectators. A splendid dinner had been provided for 400 persons by the spirited proprietors ofthe railway. Eut the hilarity of the occasion was much damped by the occurrence of a serious and fatal accident. Four carriages, in which there could be no less than fiom forty to fifty people, had just commenced the descent of the second inclined plane, when one of tbe shackles suddenly snapped, and the waggons ran with great velocity against some other waggons, when by the shock one man was killed, and a boy, nine years of age, so seriously injured, that he died during the night. Several others had bones fractured by leaping off the waggons during the descent, and many received various contusions. 1834 (May 2S;. \u2014 Being his majesty's birthday, a royal salute was fired from the castle, the bells runs' several merry peals, and the Newcastle volunteers fired a feu de joie on the Sandhill. The ships in the harbour also hoisted their flags, and other demonstrations of joy were observed in different parts of the town. June 22. \u2014 A new Catholic chapel at Minster Acres was opened. June 23. \u2014 Workmen began to prepare ground at the entrance of the Sunderland market for the erection of the arcade there. July 1. \u2014 James Liddell, convicted at the Durham assizes of forgery, escaped from the prison between the hours of one and two o'clock in the afternoon. He had forced two locks, and by the assistance of some rope and a ladder, got over the back wall of the prison. July 2. \u2014 The black tigress belonging to Wombell's menagerie produced a litter of young ones in Newcastle. This is the first instance of a breed having been obtained from those animals in England. About this period a person named Thomas Elliott, aged 87, but better known in most parts of Northumberland as Tommy the tinker, died at Chollerton Edge, in that county. He generally resided at Stamfordham, and in his peregrinations through life used frequently to walk from Tweedmouth to the latter place, a distance of upwards of sixty miles, in one day. He was very industrious, and is said to have reaped corn regularly every year for seventy-four years. July 4. \u2014 A dog. which was in an attic in a three storey house in Maud's lane, Sunderland, on a gesture made by tbe person with whom it was in charge, sprung through the window, which was open, and fell to the ground on the pavement unhurt, a height of 33 feet. The animal was upwards of four stone weight. July 15. \u2014 The bells of the churches in Newcastle rung several merry peals on account of the common council giving their formal sanction to Mr. Grainger 's improvement plans. The same evening Mr. Grainger's workmen were regaled in the Nuns-field with a plentiful supply of strong ale, &c, which drew together a great crowd of spectators, whose excited feelings led them to acts of violence.

Her son had promised to take her to Stella in the wherry, but she would not wait for that conveyance. July 22.\u2014 A murder was perpetrated on the body of Thomas Lee at Hebburn Quay. A slight quarrel arose at a tea drinking held in a public house. Thomas Lee accidentally putting out his foot which tripped up a girl while dancing, and broke her sandal, she immediately made complaint to her sweetheart, Daniel Stewart, who remonstrated with Lee in an angry tone. Lee readily apologised, and Stewart shook hands. The three then in token of reconcilliation drunk each other's health, but two of Stewart's companions, sailors, were desirous to fight Lee, who declined combat with either of them The festivities continued until two o'clock ; when the party broke up the quarrel commenced, and Lee was killed by a blow with a pewter pot. He was thrown into the water, and was not found until half-tide next morning about ten o'clock. At the assizes hejd the next week at Durham one of the men named Willis was found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to seven years' transportation. July 24. \u2014 A splendid large ship, fully rigged and manned, with one hundred tons of ballast in her hold, and in every respect fitted for sea, was launched from the building-yard of Mr. Reay, Walker-on-the-Tyne, and proceeded to sea on her voyage. July 28. \u2014 While a horse and gig were awaiting two gentlemen in the Main-street of Sunderland, the horse became restive, and the man who had the charge of it losing his hold, it took off at full speed down the street, and came in contact with a lamp-post, which it broke, and, unfortunately, just at that moment, a blind man, called Thomas Willis, better known as \" Blind Tom,'' was passing the spot, part of the lamp-post fell upon his head, and fractured his skull, and the gig also went over him. The poor man was so dreadfully bruised that he died the next morning at one o'clock. July 26. \u2014 Mr. Green, according to a promise he had made to the inhabitants of Darlington, in consequence of a failure in an attempt to ascend a few days before, commenced the process of inflating his balloon in a field, the use of which was granted for the occasion, adjoining Mr. E. Pease's house. About a quarter before six o'clock, the balloon having received a supply of gas, the cords were slackened to allow it to clear itself, it was then fastened on a cart with the car, in which Mr. Green and two females were seated. It was then conducted up North-street, preceded by a band playing favourite airs. It was a magnificent sight, and the street was much crowded with spectators.

He landed at Pilmoor House, near Croft, about four miles from Darlington. 1834 (July.) \u2014 The following is a correct copy of a manuscript circular, emanating from William Carr, esq., of Eshot, high sheriff of Northumberland, one hundred and twenty-five years ago. Its date is two years anterior to the advent of newspapers in New castle, and similar circulars would doubtless be sent to all the gentry on such occasions. At that period it appears that the high sheriff did not meet at the County Court, but at what appears was an inn. It is very singular that Mr. Brand, in his list of sheriffs, says \" none occurs in 1709 \" : \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 Her Majestyes Justices assigned to take the Assizes for the County of Northumberland haveing appoynted to begin the same the twenty third Instant, I request the favour of yor.

During the excavations, the workmen found an ancient cast of a crucifix, the remains of a gilt spur, a farthing of William the Third, and two other small coins. Several other articles of interest were discovered during the progress of the work. August 1. \u2014 Died, at Canton, aged 52, the Rev. Robert Morrison, D D. This distinguished missionary and oriental scholar was born at Wingates, in the parish of Longhorsley, Northumberland, on the 5th of January, 1782, but removed in infancy to Buller's Green, Morpeth, where he continued to reside till about 1785, when his parents removed to Newcastle. At an early age he became apprentice to his father, who was a Dunfermline man, and whose business was that of a last and boot tree maker, in which business his son soon became skilful and industrious. The shop in which he wrought was in a passage in the Groat-market, now know by the name of Dagg's-entry or Morrison's-court. Whilst but a youth his passion for knowledge became intense, and the Rev. A. Laidlaw, of the Silver-street Presbyterian chapel, was his first instructor in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. He com menced to write shorthand, to study theology, and become a zealous member of the Society for the relief of the Homeless Poor. In 1804 he was sufficiently advanced in his studies to pass his examination as a clergyman, and about a year after he offered himself as a missionary to China, and was accepted The first great object of the mission was to form a Chinese dictionary, the next to translate the scriptures. Both these great works have been accomplished by the two first men appointed to the mission, Mr;"], [30, "24 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF |~A.D. 1834. Morrison and Mr. Milne, the latter of whom departed this life some years ago. The translation of the scriptures was a work common to both of these two eminent missionaries. The translation and compilation of the dictionary was Mr. Morrison's own, and is the monument cf his fame. His remains were followed from his residence to the river side by Lord Napier and all the European, American, and Asiatic British subjects in Canton. The corpse was forwarded to Macao, and followed to the grave by about forty European gentlemen, and interred in the Protestant burial ground in that settlement. 1834 (August 1). \u2014 A new joint stock coach commenced to run between Gateshead and Stanhope by way of Whickham, Bumopfield, Lanchester, Wolsingham, &c. This was the first coach ever attempted on that line of road. August 5. \u2014 Died, at Hartlepool, Durham, Edward Dixon, esq , age M4. Mr. Dixon's family (Dixon of Beeston) is one of considerable antiquity, having been located at Beeston, in Yorkshire, for several centuries, and being also the representative of the very ancient line of the De Beistons, the last of whom, Dorothy de Beiston, who died in 1635, married his ancestor Ralph Dixon, esq., and from the eldest son of which marriage Mr. Dixon was descended. August 6. \u2014 Died, in the 73rd year of his age, James Wilkie, M.D., resident surgeon and apothecary to the Dispensary, New castle, which important situation he filled upwards of fifty years. During this long period he discharged with great ability, singular fidelity, and unwearied zeal, the duties of his office, to which his uncommonly healthy constitution and vigorous mind enabled him punctually to attend till within a few months of the close of his valuable life. He was remarkable for his simplicity of manner, energy and decision of character, honest pride, love of justice, and integrity, and for his humanity and benevolence of disposition, and steady attachment to his friends, but the most prominent quality in his character, and the one for which he is entitled to be remem bered with the greatest respect and gratitude, was his generous and humane attention to every case of distress which it was in his power to relieve. August 9. \u2014 A locust of extraordinary size was found alive in the nursery of William Falla, esq., of Gateshead. It was similar to the specimen described by Lineaus as the migratory locust. This is a very singular circumstance, and its being found in that part of the country is of very rare occurrence. August 10.\u2014 The fine ship Palmer, 600 tons burthen, sailed from Newcastle with passengers and goods, to Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales, being the first vessel that had left the port of Tyne for these colonies. August 25.\u2014 Mr. William Walker, mason, of Branton, North umberland, and Mr. William Atkinson, joiner, Powburn, accom panied by Mr. Thomas Duncan, teacher, Glanton, left Branton early in the morning to go trout fishing in the river Breamish.

Walker, who went into the water first, immediately disappeared. Atkinson, who was a very athletic man, plunged in to save him, but unhappily he sunk also, but soon after- wards came to the top, and reached out his fishing rod, which he still kept hold of, to Mr. Duncan ; unfortunately, however, the water was running so furiously the the rod on which the lives of Atkinson and Walker were depending, broke, and they again sunk to rise no more. Mr. Duncan's humanity for his fellow sufferers prompted him to plunge in also, but he was soon carried away by the furious current, and had it not been for the timely assistance of Mr. Robert Donkin, of Ingram, he would have shared the fate of his companions. He was taken out of the water almost in a lifeless state. 1834 (August 29. ;\u2014 Died, at Percy Main, aged 93, Mr. Charles Gardener. It is somewhat singular that, during his long life, it only cost him two shillings and sixpence for medicine, and one shilling for extracting two teeth. He worked until his 90th year. August 30. \u2014 This was the most successful herring season on the coast of Northumberland ever remembered, and was the means of employing a great many industrious fishermen and their families, in the process of curing ; they were sold in the streets of Alnwick at six a penny. September 8. \u2014 Two gentlemen from Durham, James and Cuthbert Kirby, brothers, attended the Falkirk Tryst, and purchased a number of sheep, which were sent forward on their way to England, to Shieldhill, a village about two miles to the south of Falkirk, in the charge of Cuthbert Kirby, and a drover. The sheep were put into a field, and Mr. Kirby, after having partaken of supper, went out, but not returning, his absence began to create uneasiness, and about ten o'clock, a man went in search of him. Every exertion to discover the trace of Mr. Kirby proved fruitless, when it was suspected that he had fallen down an old coal pit, which had been allowed to stand open, without so much as a fence around the mouth of it. This culpable negligence was the cause of death in this instance. Some of the workmen at Carron lent their assistance and soon had a windlass on the spot, and as a precautionary measure against gas, which was likely to have accumulated at the bottom of the mine, a collier's lamp was let down, and an intrepid individual, William Henderson, then descended to the full depth of 120 feet, and found the corpse of the unfortunate man. A dreadful wound presented itself on the left temple, the skull being completely driven in, the left shoulder was likewise broken, and one of the thighs much injured.

About two o'clock, an engine arrived from Medomsley Colliery, bringing 100 waegons of coal, and this train was followed by a second, containing the directors of the line and their friends. The coal was then deposited in the ship Sally, of South Shields, being the first vessel loaded at the new drops. A dinner was given to the workmen, 1 ,000 in number, and a grand banquet afterwards took place at the Golden Lion Inn, R. Ingham, esq., M.P., in the chair, at which 120 gentlemen sat down. The Stanhope and Tyne Railway was 32 miles in length, and was constructed by agreement with the landowners, without the aid of parliament, at a cost of upwards of half a million sterling. 1834 (September 15;. \u2014 The river Tyne displayed one of the most animating scenes that had ever probably been witnessed upon its waters. The occasion was the holding of a Regatta for the first time in this neighbourhood ; and about mid-day crowds of well dressed people were proceeding to the place appointed for the races, a number of equestrians, and carriages filled for the most part with fashionably attired ladies, added considerably to the lively bustle of the scene. The Regatta was appointed to take place at twelve o'clock, and shortly after that hour the stewards, namely, the Right Worshipful the Mayor (Henry Bell, esq.), J, T. Carr, esq., deputy master of the Trinity-house, and W. A. Surtees, esq., arrived in a boat, at the stern of which was exhibited a blue silk flag, bearing the arms of the town surmounted by the words \"Tyne Regatta,\" the barges of the Mayor, the Trinity-house, a private barge, several steamers with their decks thronged with passengers, the gigs which were intended to compete for the prizes, and a large number of other boats followed, and the river at the head of the King's Meadows, presented a spectacle of a peculiarly striking character. September 1 7. \u2014 One of the very large steam boilers at Elemore pit, Hetton Colliery, Durham, by some unexplained circumstance was shifted from its place by the force of the steam, and thrown a distance of forty yards, and rolled ten yards further. A man, named George Bell, was killed upon the spot. Peter Thornton, and William Smith, were severely scalded. John Potts was thrown a very great distance against an ash heap, and with such force that he was completely engulphed in it, and could not be extricated till the ashes had been cleared from around him. September 19. \u2014 The London Gazette contained an order in Council, declaring Newcastle-upon-Tyne one of the ports for the importation of goods from places within the limits of the East India Company's charter.

There was an exciting contest for the office of recorder, between G. H. Wilkinson, esq., and R. C. Askew, esq., the latter being the corporation candidate ; but the former was elected by a majority of 14 to 10. Mr. Alderman Robson was elected mayor of Durham. October 31. \u2014 Died, at his house, in Percy-street, Newcastle, in the 60th year of his age, Mr. John Bruce. For upwards of forty years he filled the arduous situation of a teacher of youth, first in Alnwick, his native place, and then in Newcastle. The deceased was the author of a work on geography, which has obtained very wide estimation, and he was also the compiler of other elementary works. At the time of his death he had, in conjunction with his son, the Rev. J. C. Bruce, the direction of one of the most extensive and flourishing seminaries in the North of England. His funeral, which took place on November the 5th, was attended by a large number of the principal inhabitants of Newcastle. Soon after- wards, an elegant monument, designed by Mr. J. Green, was placed in Westgate cemetery, over his remaius, at the cost of his friends and pupils. October. \u2014 This month, the new line of road leading from Belsay to Otterburn, was opened to the public. This desirable under- taking greatly reduces the distance between Newcastle and Edin- burgh, being now only 98 miles.

It was announced that Mr. Brown, from Sunderland, would accompany him ; but iu consequence of a deficiency of gas, Mr. Greeu durst not attach his car to the balloon, and being determined to ascend, though dissuaded from it, he went up astride a rope in a beautiful aud majestic manner, and in about four minutes alighted in the river near Howdon, from which situ- ation he was rescued by some scullermen. November 11. \u2014 An inquest was held at Ebchester on the body of Isabella Browell. It appeared that on the day preceding, William Ward, parish clerk, an old man nearly 80 years of age, was hand ling a gun in his house, not knowing it was loaded, it went off, and the CDntents lodged in the body of the deceased, who was his grand daughter, killing her on the spot.

Gill, whilst sporting over the manor of his father, Harry Gill, esq., of Williamson, Kuaresdale, sat down to rest, when his attention was attracted by a moorcock falling dead at his feet. On looking up, he observed an immense ea^le hovering near, at which he immediately tired, and winged it. The monarch of the air, on being approached, and being unable to"], [34, "a.d. 1834. 28 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF effect its escape by flight, gave battle, and was only captured after a hard struggle. The young gentlemau having overcome his antagonist, took him by the neck, threw him over his shoulder, aud carried him to his father's residence. It was discovered, on examining the moorcock, that the eagle had struck its head off with his talons, whilst hovering in the air. 1834 (November 18J\u2014 A grand dinner was given at the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, to the Earl of Durham, by his friends and admirers in that town.

Mr. Williamson was descended from the respectable family of Hopper, of the county palatine, and marry ing the heiress of Dr. Williamson, of Whickham, he assumed her name iu addition to his own. In 1794 he was elected recorder of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which important office he filled with the most distinguished ability until the death of Mrs. Williamson, in 1829, when he tendered his resignation. He was appointed to the temporal chancellorship of Durham, iu 1819, by Bishop Barrington, and he sustained the duties which appertained to it, then highly onerous aud important, in a manner which did him the highest credit. For many years Mr. Williamson practised as a chamber counsel in Newcastle, and no man has ever had his opinion upon the great and various questions submitted to his consideration more implicitly deferred to \u2014 patient and indefatigable in all his researches\u2014 his opinions had the moral force and influence of judicial decisions \u2014 an honour which has been conceded to no other jurisconsult of his time. In politics he was a whig of the old school, and he attended the polling booth at the recent election for Newcastle, aud polled a plumper for Sir M. W. Ridley, bart., declaring that this act would, as it proved to be, the last public action of his life. The energies of his mind and the strength of his faculties remained in full vigour to the last ; and he passed hia four score years without being subject to any of those senilities which so generally mark the great age to which he had the happi ness to attain. Ou Tuesday, the 20th, his remains were interred at Whickham with great respect ; the members of the corporation, gentlemen of the legal profession, &c, occupying upwards of forty carriages, followed the hearse, notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather.

In celebration of tbe event, the directors and shareholders of the gas company walked in procession through the town, and afterwards dined together at the Black Bull Inn, R. Stokoe, esq., in the chair. January 26. \u2014 Early on the morning of this day, a daring burglary was committed at the house of Mr. Crighton, solicitor, in Eldon-place, Newcastle. Between three and four o'clock, Mr. Crigh ton was alarmed by hearing a noise in the lower part of his house, and having procured a light, and armed himself with a poker, he proceeded down stairs to ascertain the cause ; but on reaching the passage, his light was blown out by the wind, and almost at the same instant a man rushed out of the dining-room. A scuffle then ensued between them, during which Mr. Crighton struck the thie: some severe blows with the poker, but in return received several bruises, and had the end of one of his fingers bitten off. The thief, however, unfortunately effected his escape through the back door. An alarm was instantly given, and the assistance of some of his neighbours and the watchman having been procured, a strict search was made, but no trace of the depredator could be met with. On examining the back parlour it appeared that the thief had put up some of Mr. Crighton's clothes into a bundle, and had helped himself to some wine and cake ; he was supposed to have entered by the window.

A large stick of chimnies on Mr. Armstrong's woollen drapers premises, Mosley- street, fell with a tremendous crash, and burst in nearly the whole of the roof on one side, several ot the bricks falling into Mosley-street. The temporary pavillion of a \" Billy Purvis,\" which was erected on the Parade ground, was completely shivered to atoms, and the wood work blown far and wide. A Glue manufactory at Friar's-goose was completely blown down. The chimnies at the residence of Mr. Peacock, Wallsend, were blow down and came through the roof into the second storey, and would have been fatal to his children, had they not just before left the room.

March 3. \u2014 The new chapel at Heworth was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of St. David's. March 9. \u2014 Great interest was excited in Newcastle aud the adjoining district, by the opening of a portion of the Newcastle and Carlisle railway. The morning was uncommonly fine, and at an early hour numerous groups of persons were seen bending their steps in the direction of Blaydon, from which place the procession was announced to start at ten o'clock. Two trains were prepared for the reception of the intended excursionists. At a quarter before eleven the first train left Blaydon, drawn by the Rapid locomotive engine, and was followed by the Comet engine leading the second train, at six minutes before eleven. Both these engines were made in Newcastle ; the former by Messrs. Stephenson and Co., and the latter by Messrs. Hawthorn. About half-past one the party reached Hexham, where banners, triumphal arches, &c, had been prepared for the occasion, and the whole of the passengers were provided with refreshment, at the various inns, at the expense of the directors. At twenty minutes past three the trains left Hexham, and returned to Blaydon in one uninteriupted trip of seventeen miles, in one hour and ten minutes. Throughout the whole of the line, the adjacent country poured forth its inhabitants, and nothing could exceed the interesting spectacle which the villages and cottages presented. Bands of music, flags, the ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, and the hearty cheers of the assembled multitude, gave a joyous welcome to this first and auspicious journey on the Newcastle and Carlisle railway. A dinner was held in the evening in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, the mayor (J. L. Hood, esq ), presiding, and about 80 gentlemen sat down to commemorate the interesting proceedings of the day. On the following day the regular passenger trains, four in number, commenced running daily between the two places ; passengers from Newcastle being conveyed to Blaydon by omnibusses, and goods being forwarded to the same place by a steamboat, which departed"], [39, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 33 once a day from Newcastle quay, at such hours as suited the tide. The act of parliament under which the Newcastle and Carlisle rail- way had been formed prohibited the use of locomotive engines at a time (1829) when their construction was such as rendered them little better than a nuisance ; but since the improvement in their manufacture, such objections were wholly surmounted. In Novem- ber, 1834, the managers ofthe railway gave notice of application to parliament for authority to use steam engines, as about seventeen miles of the road were about to be opened. All the landowners on the line gave their assent, except C. Bacon Grey, esq., of Styford, and on the railway being opened, and engines placed on it, he had recourse to the court of chancery, and obtained an injunction against their use. Notice to this effect was served on the directors on Saturday, March the 28th, when the railway was of course laid idle. A great sensation followed. A public meeting was held on the subject on the 6th of April, in the Guildhall, Newcastle, con- vened by the mayor, J. L. Hood, esq , according to a requisition most numerously and respectably signed ; and other demonstrations of popular feeling having been manifested, Mr. Grey eventually withdrew his opposition, and the business of the railway was re- sumed on the 6th of May. 1835 (March 9). \u2014 The neighbourhood of Barnardcastle and Brough was visited by a most violent storm of wind and snow. The Lord Exmouth coach, from Newcastle to Liverpool, experienced the greatest difficulty in getting up to Spital Inn, Stainmore, which it reached several hours past its regular time. After waiting some time, the coachman attempted to go to Brough, but the storm con- tinuing wi-h unabated fury, he could not proceed more than three or four hundred yards, and thought it prudent to return to Spital Inn, and wait until Tuesday morning, and with great difficulty reached Brough in the afternoon of that day, the snow being from six to nine feet deep. March 13- \u2014 Six adult persons received public baptism in Ham- sterley church. March. \u2014 The workmen of Mr. Richard Grainger, in digging foundations in the Nuns'-field, Newcastle, for his new bnildings, dug up the foundations of some old buildings, and in connection with them, an ancient burial ground. Among other things, a stone coffin, two lead coffins, and the decayed wood of several others were found, from three to four feet deep, most of them embedded in clay. From the number of human bones discovered, it may fairly be inferred that it has been the regular place of burial of the nuns of the order of St. Bartholomew, which takes a distin guished stand in the history of Newcastle. This ground, after passing into different hands, was sold, on the demise of Sir Walter Blackett, its previous proprietor, to Mr. G. Anderson, in 1783. In 1834, it was bought by Mr. R. Grainger, for his new markets, &c, in digging the foundations for which the above relics were found. Several entire skulls were also found, and two of the most perfect were preserved. It would seem from the size of the bones VOL. III. F"], [40, "34 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1835. and the thinness of the skulls, that the remains of the sisterhood had been chiefly buried there. 1835 (March). \u2014 The workmen commenced pulling down the old custom house aud the houses upon the Mark quay, Sunderland, preparatory to the erection of staiths in connection with the Sun derland and Durham railway. April 2. \u2014 Was presented to Mrs. Hood, the lady of J. L. Hcod, esq., the last mayor of the old corporation of Newcastle, a splendid tureen, for the purchase of which \u00a3100 was voted by the common council, on her having a daughter during the mayoralty. The tureen is as much deserving of praise for its general form as for the skill with which all the minut\u00e6 of the work upon it has been finished. On one side are the arms of Hood, on thp other the fol lowing inscription : \u2014 '\u25a0 To Mrs. Hood, Mayoress of Newcastle, this token of regard and admiration was presented by the Common Council, on the occasion of the birth of a daughter, Theodosi Rose, in the Mansion House, a.d. 1835.\" April 14. \u2014 Died, in Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, nged 100, Mary, mother of Mr. John Smith, victualler, ofthe High-bridge. April 20. \u2014 The birthday of his grace the Duke of Northumber land \u2014 having completed his fiftieth year \u2014 was celebrated as usual at Alnwick, by a public dinner in the Town-hall. At Chirton, North Shields, and other places on his grace's estates, similar rejoicings took place, the duke being a liberal contributor towards the expenses incurred. May 4. \u2014 A man named Robinson, and five boys, were unfortu nately killed at Whitley colliery, in consequence of the hook which is appended to the chain not having been properly put into the bow ofthe corf which the unfortunate sufferers were in, by which over sight they fell from the top to the bottom of the pit, a depth of forty-five fathoms. May 5. \u2014 This morning, about three o'clock, a fire broke out in the Salutation Inn, Tynemouth, Northumberland, which threatened destruction to the adjoining property, but the prompt arrival of the engine from the castle, and the able assistance of Captain Hughes, Lieutenant Stoney, and a number of soldiers, prevented the flames from doing further damage than the complete destruction of the kitchen. May 18.\u2014 The service connected with laying the foundation stone of the Providence chapel, Marlborough-crescent, Newcastle, was attended to on this day, when a suitable address was delivered on the occasion by Mr. John Poynder, of Lockwood, Yorkshire. The chapel was opened on the 23rd of September following. May 31. \u2014 A stout, ragged, dirty-looking man, begging in the town of Morpeth, was taken into custody, and on his person was found the following amount, \u00a3349 ls. 7d., viz. :\u2014 Bank Bill of British Linen Company, No. 4,931, April 30th, 1835, for \u00a3125 5s. 8d. ; Bank of Scotland, No. 10,938, April 30th, for \u00a335 ; Bank of Scotland, No. 10,957, May lst, 1835, for \u00a3186 3s lid. ;' silver, \u00a32 ; copper, 12s. His name was Robert Ferguson, a native of Berwick-upon-Tweed."], [41, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 35 1835 (June 10.) \u2014 This day, Newcastle and neighbourhood were visited by a violent storm, which was attended with loss of life and considerable damage to property. At Gateshead Low Fell, a woman, named Dawson, in an advanced state of pregnancy, was struck by the lightning whilst standing at her cottage door, and killed on the spot. The electric fluid had entered by the chimney, destroying a bedstead, alter which it struck the poor woman, and then passed through the roof of the cottage, shattering the tiles to atoms. The husband had a narrow escape, his hat being laid flat to his head. At Durham the thunder and lightning were awful, accompanied by a heavy fall of rain. The spire of one of the western towers of the Cathedral was struck by electric fluid, and a a portion of the pinnacle thrown some distance into the churchyard. At Shotley-bridge the storm of hail and rain was truly alarming ; pieces of ice fell near four inches in circumference, which soou melted, causing the river Derwent to overflow, doing considerble damage, particularly to the fields adjoining Mr. Annandale's paper works. On the Ilth, a woman, named Cawthorn, was struck dead in a cottage at Ebchester, and another was much burnt. The house of Mr. Watson, farmer, Walbottle, was also entered by the light ning, the chimney being rent from top to bottom, and the windows broken to pieces. One person was struck by the fluid, and para lysed lor some hours. The wife of Mr. Watson was much burnt, and a person in the next house was severely scorched. The houses of Mr. Maddison, of Wandon, and Mr. Grey, of East Lilburn, were also struck, the lightning passing through almost every room. Sunderland, Shields, and other plsces were also visited by the storm. June 11. \u2014 A few minutes before three o'clock, in an instant, and without a moments warning, three houses on the south side of Market-street, Newcastle, in the course of erection by Mr. Richard Grainger, fell with a tremendous crash, and the men being at work, they were precipitated along with them, and buried in the ruins. At the time when the catastrophe occurred, the buildings had nearly reached their intended height, and upwards of 100 men were at work upon, and immediately around them. It had thundered several times just before the accident, and those who were standing near the spot described the noise which attended the falling edifice as equally loud and sudden as a clap of thunder. The occurrence caused the greatest consternation, and measures were immediately adopted for disinterring those who had been buried by the material. In the course of half an hour twelve men were got out, three dead, and nearly all the rest greatly injured. Up to three o'clock on Friday morning fifteen men had been extricated, four of whom were dead, ten removed to the Infirmary, and John Kilgour, the foreman of the masons, who was taken to his owu house, died in a few hours afterwards. Of those sent to the Infirmary, two after wards died. Many of the workmen did themselves great credit by their intrepidity and the exertions they made to recover their unfortunate companions, labouring as they did jn the midst of great"], [42, "36 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1835. danger sfrom the shattered state of the walls left standing, and which from their leaning position seemed likely to fall every moment. By the, directions of the mayor and magistrates a party of military were placed around the Nuns-field to prevent the ingress of the populace, which might have caused further accidents. No satis factory reason could be given for the falling of the property, but the opinion most generally entertained was that the building had been struck by lightning, which had been prevalent for some time previous. Mr. Grainger himself had been inspecting the workmen a minute or two before, and was at the time of the accident on the scaffolding of an adjoining building. 1835 (June 12.; \u2014 Two splendid and massive soup tureens, with stands, &c, were presented, at the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, to John Hodgson, esq., late M.P. for that town, as a token of respect on the part of the subscribers for the able manner in which he had acted as their representative in three successive parliaments. Sanderson Ilderton, esq., officiated as chairman, and presented the plate in the name of the subscribers with a suitable speech. Mr. Hodgson returned thanks in an address which drew forth repeated cheering from a large company which had assembled on the occasion. June 13. \u2014 After several years labour, the owners of Monkwear mouth colliery (Messrs. Thompson, Pemberton, and Co.) succeeded in loading the first vessel placed under their improved staith with a cargo of coals. The workmen on the occasion were profusely regaled with strong ale, and great rejoicing took place throughout the whole of the day. June 15 \u2014 Died, in Pilgrim-street, Newcastle,' Miss Collingwood, last surviving sister of Admiral Lord Collingwood. June 18. \u2014 This afternoon, aboout two o'clock, one of those most dreadful explosions took place \u2014 which have been so lamentably frequent in mining districts \u2014 at one of Mr. Russell's collieries, at Wallsend, known by the name of the Church Pit, or Russell's Old Wallsend, by which twenty-six men and seventy-five boys lost their lives, leaving twenty-four widows and eighty-three children to lament their fate. The number of work-people employed in this colliery was about 220, one hundred and five of whom were in the mine at the time of the explosion, The colliery was inspected in the morning by the under-viewer, when it was considered to be perfectly safe; and four \"overmen\" and \"deputies,\" who were among the sufferers, had been acquainted with the pit for thirty years. The catastrophe was made known to the banksman by a considerable report, which they spoke of as being like an earth quake, accompanied by a rushing of choke-damp to the mouth of the shaft, bringing up some of the pitmen's clothes, and other light articles from the bottom. On the alarm being given, the vicinity of the mine was soon crowded with anxious enquirers, but it was found impossible to enter the workings until the next day, when the after-damp had partially cleared away. During this tedious interval the anguish of the relations of the workmen may easily be"], [43, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 37 conceived. On the following day twenty-one bodies were removed, and the work of humanity was persevered in, until all the bodies had been found and taken to their sorrowing friends. But on the 21st, to the astonishment of every one connected with the colliery, four of the unfortunate creatures were found to be alive. They were immediately brought up with the most assiduous care, and eager hopes were infused into the hearts of many, that others would be found who had been similarly favoured. This pleasing hope was, however, soon dispelled. These men thus rescued from a terrible fate, could give no idea of their mode of preservation. They were at times quite delirious, and had no idea of the time which elapsed between the occurrence of the accident and that of their fortunate rescue. The scene at Wallsend on the 22nd was especially distressing ; numbers were buried there, and it was a painful sight to see two and even three bodies brought from the same house and borne away amid the agonized cries of their relations. No cause could be assigned for this dreadful calamity which was the second great explosion that had occurred at the pit. 1835 (June 2b). \u2014 The foundation-stone of Salem chapel, for the use of the Methodist New Connexion \u2014 built by Mr. Grainger, in Hood-street, Newcastle \u2014 was laid by Wm. Ridgway, esq., of Northwood, Staffordshire Potteries, who delivered an appropriate speech on the occasion. Afterwards, about two hundred and fifty ofthe friends took tea at the Music Hall. June 26. \u2014 A young angler named Robert Donkin left Rothbury in the morning to enjoy the delightful recreation of fly fishing. Having filled his creel in a short time, he was obliged to borrow an apron from a cottage during his excursion ; and, after enjoying the charms of the romantic dales and pleasant streams, which present in their course every variety of smooth water, rapids, and pools for the exercise of the angler's skill, he finally returned home with the very extensive stock of eighteen dozen fine trouts, which he had caught with a single hook during the day. June 28. \u2014 On the casting of a hive of bees at Walsingham, the swarm alighted on a young woman and covered her from her shoulders to the crown of her head, forming a complete hood ; and what is most remarkable, they were hived without her receiving a single sting. June 29. \u2014 The first exhibition of the Newcastle Society of Artists took place in the Academy of Arts, Blackett-street, Newcastle. The collections of paintings and sculpture, about two hundred specimens, was mostly executed by resident artists. The three Richardsons contributed 42 of the number, Carmichael 18, Thorpe 30, Mackneth 14, and Snow 14. July 2. \u2014 The first cargo of coals from Haswell colliery was shipped at Seaham, when great rejoicings took place. The winning of this colliery cost upwards of \u00a3100,000. July 9. \u2014 That stupendous undertaking, the Hartlepool docks and harbour, was opened for tUe shipment of coal and merchandize. The day being extremely fine great rejoicings took place. The"], [44, "38 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF fA-D- 1835. first shipment of coals was made in the Britannia, of Sunderland. Having taken her cargo on board, she proceeded to sea, amid the ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, and the acclamations of those who had assembled to witness the ceremony. 1835 (July). \u2014 This month, whilst some workmen were opening out an old pit near Whickham, county of Durham, which had been closed upwards of eighty years, they found at the bottom, 28 fathoms, a live toad, which was presented to John Watson, Whickham. It is still more singular how the animal could exist in the foul air, as the men had to erect a brattice to ventilate the shaft before they could enter. July 30. \u2014 About half-past ten o'clock in the forenoon, the boiler attached to the extensive worsted and carpet factory of Messrs. John and William Henderson, Durham, exploded with tremendous force, carrying away the walls, &c, of the engine room, scattering in fragments a large chimney, the factory bell, clock, and appendages, and doing great damage to the adjacent building. The part of the boiler which was blown away rose in the air like a balloon, and fell with a loud crash on the opposite shore of the Wear, a distance of upwards of 100 yards. The number of workmen in the building at the time was about 170. but the personal injuries received were confined to nine persons, who were buried by the falling n:aterials, and three of theoe expired shortly after. July 30. \u2014 The royal assent was given to the Brandling Junction railway bill. August 17. \u2014 The Trustees of the Derwent and Shotley Bridge Turnpike Road, opened that part of the line which leads from Axwell Park Gate to Long Close Gate, near Hamsterley, the distance six miles. This useful road passes through a hilly and beautifully wooded district, yet it is in all parts of easy inclination ; it winds through the most picturesque part of the North of England, and the traveller on business or pleasure must be highly gratified by the many splendid views and great variety of delightful scenery. August 21. \u2014 A neat Wesleyan Chapel was opened at Edmond byers, in the county of Durham. August 26. \u2014 The very handsome stone bridge across North Tyne, at Bellinghnm, was opened to the public, amidst the rejoicings of a large assemblage of persons from the surrounding country. August 28. \u2014 Died, at Eltringham, aged 91, much respected, Mr. Matthew Johnson. During the great flood in the Tyne, in 1771, which see, the house in which ho resided, near Ovingham boat house, was thrown down by the current, when Johnson and part of his family saved their lives by catching hold of a tree, to which they clung until the water subsided, September 14 \u2014 This day, Daniel O'Connel, esq., M.P., visited Newcastle, on which occasion the town presented a very animated appearance, from the number of persons assembled to witness his arrival. At twelve o'clock, a number of gentlemen met in St."], [45, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 39 Nicholas' Square, where a large hustings had been erected, and shortly after, Mr. J. Fife having taken the chair, an address of congratulation was agreed upon for presentation to Mr. O'Connell. The parties then lett the hustings, and proceeded with three bands of music and numerous banners to Gateshead, to meet the learned gentleman. At about half-past two Mr. O'Connell was met by an immense concourse of people at Sunderland Road-End, those who were more immediately connected with the arrangements, forming themselves into a procession, in which they walked four abreast. In this order they reached St. Nicholas' Square, where Mr. O'Connell was hailed with deafening applause. Mr. Fife again took the chair, and Mr. Larkin presented the address which had been agreed upon. Mr. O'Connell afterwards addressed the assembly at some length amidst great enthusiasm. At five o'clock, about three hundred and forty gentlemen sat down to dinner in the Music-hall, in Blackett-street, John Fife, esq., in the chair. 1S35 (September 15j. \u2014 John Jobling was unfortunately killed on Lord Durham's railway, near Bishopwearmouth, by several waggons running over him. What is remarkable, his son lost his life in the same manner a few years before ; also his son-in-law. September 26. \u2014 As W. A. Mitchell, of Newcastle, was fishing with the rod from the rocks at the south end of Cullercoats Sands, he perceived a large fish apparently entangled amongst some weeds. After some efforts, it was forced into a hole amongst the rocks, and with the skilful aid of another gentleman, the fish was secured by means of a spear which was attached to the bottom part of Mr. Mitchell's rod. It proved to. be a fine specimen of the Sophius Fiscatorius, which, by the singular management of the fins, by paddling the water, and the elevation of the slender horns which are near its eyes, manages to catch fish by a mode much resembling angling, and which has procured it the name of \" The Angler.\" It weighed 441b., and was about a yard and a half long and half a yard broad. October 1. \u2014 A curious circumstance occurred in the Tyne, at North Shields. A person in the employ of Messrs. Corntbot, Carr, and Co., North Shields, while busy with his daily occupation on the Low-lights shore, observed an unusual ripple in the water, when, to his astonishment, he observed a large cod fish, about three feet long, which having attempted to swallow a sole about fifteen inches long, and not being able either to swallow or eject it, had in its agony made towards the shore, and was the occasion of its capture. October 3. \u2014 Died, in the 31st year of his age, Mr. John Mackay Wilson, for a number of years editor of the Berwick Advertiser, and author of various compositions in prose and poetry. The I ales of the Borders, a periodical work, were projected, and to a considerable extent written, hy Mr. Wilson, and they enjoyed an almost unexampled popularity for some time. October 8. \u2014 At night an immense mass of limestone rock projecting from the south bank of the river Wear, near Lord"], [46, "40 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1835. Durham's drops, fell with a tremendous force into the river below. Fortunately, no vessel was in the berth at the time, or inevitable destruction must have ensued The weight of the stone was sup posed to be about six hundred tons. 1835 (October 12.)\u2014 About eight o'clock am., William Dickson, esq., of Alnwick, and Mr. J. T. Turnbull, clerk to the magistrates, had a very narrow escape from serious injury. These gentlemen were in a chaise on their return to Newcastle from Tynemouth. On reaching the railway upon which the coals are conveyed from the Cramlington and Seghill collieries to the river Tyne, and which crosses the road about two miles from Shields, they were alarmed by observing from the window of the vehicle a train of loaded waggons coming along the self-acting inclined plane, so near as to render it probable the chaise would be run down. The driver, however, whipped his horses, and used great exertions, but, not withstanding which, the foremost waggon struck the hinder part of the chaise, broke in the panel, and overturned the vehicle into the road. The shock was so tremendous as to upset the first waggon ofthe train, and throw several others off the railroad. The driver of the chaise was likewise thrown down with great violence, and in jured in his head and thigh. Had the chaise been struck in the centre, instead of near the hind part, the consequences must have been fatal to Mr. Dickson and Mr. Turnbull. October 22. \u2014 The completion of the new markets at Newcastle by Mr. Grainger was celebrated by a public dinner, at which nearly 2,<\">00 individuals sat down under one roof; that of the green market, forming a mere section of the splendid erections. These markets are the most magnificent in the world. This will be apparent from a comparative statement of the new markets in Newcastle with the most extensive in Great Britain. Hungerford market, in London, in point of grandeur and architectural effect, is allowed to surpass Covent Garden, and these, with St. John's, in Liverpool, are the only markets with which any comparison need be instituted. As regards the space occupied, Newcastle market is larger than Hungeiford in the proportion of 13,906 square yards to 6,400 square yards, and exceeds St. John's, in Liverpool, in the proportion of 13,906 to 8,235 square yards. In this calculation the shops adjoining the maiket are included, and so far as their situation and their nature of occupation are concerned, the area upon which they stand may properly be considered part of the market. The shops fronting the markets in Clayton-street and Grainger-street are in length 410 feet each, and in Nun-street and Nelson-street 312 feet. These erections, during the time of their progress, were not only objects of great interest to the inhabitants of Newcastle and the suirounding towns, but also to strangers fivm a distance, including many distinguished noblemen and gentlemen. The area occupied by the markets exceed two acres. The butcher market consists of four spacious avenues, 19 feet 4 inches broad, and 27 feet high, extending in length 338 feet, and containing in each about 48 butchers' shops, well lighted and"], [47, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 41 ventilated. The walls and ceilings are plastered, the latter being ornamented with intersecting plaster beams, and in the eastern avenue the rays of light descend from 50 skylights, through the apertures in the coffer ceiling, with the most imposing effect. There are in the butcher market, besides the skylights, 360 windows, inclosed with cast iron glazed sashes, to open or shut as the state of the weather may require. The four principal avenue3 are connected by four rows of lofty arcades, 12 feet wide. The avenues are brilliantly lighted with gas, and the whole comprises a splendid bazaar of shops, which strikes the stranger on entering with astonishment and wonder beyond description. The vegetable market is connected with the butcher market by a continuation of the four arcades before described, and is entered from the surrounding streets by four other arcades or passageways, 12 feet wide, two in Clayton-street, one in Nun-street, and one in Nelson- street, over each of which is placed a dome light. This building is erected in a different style from the butcher market, consisting of one stupendous hall, exceeding in dimensions the far-famed and justly-admired hall of Westminster. It is 314 feet in length, and 59 feet in width within the the fronts of the fruit shops, which surround the interior. It is covered with a cathedral-framed roof, the timbers of which are planed and exposed to view. It is upwards of forty feet in height, and is supported by two rows of cast-iron pillars (to each of which a brilliant gas lamp is affixed), 26 feet high, and is surrounded by a glazed lantern extending the full length of the hall, giving light to the centre, while the extremities are lighted by 104 windows similar to those of the butcher market. In mentioning the ornamental and useful conveniences of the green market we must not omit to notice the two magnificent fountains, which in form and dimensions resemble the beautiful fountain in the gardens of the Borghese palace at Rome. They are constructed of the finest description of stone from the quarries at Kenton, near Newcastle. When the day was fixed for opening the splendid markets we have feebly attempted to describe, there was a general wish to celebrate the event by a public dinner. The stewards of the incorporated companies agreed upon a plan of operation, and obtained the sanction of the mayor and the permission of Mr. Grainger to carry it into effect. A public announcement was then made that the dinner would take place in the vegetable market, and to enable those in a humble station as well as those in the higher walks of life to participate in the festive scene, it was determined that the price of admission to one end of the hall should be 2s. each, including dinner and ale, and that the tickets to the north-east end should be 5s. each, including dinner and wine. To render Ihe hall as comfortable as circumstances would admit, every avenue except one was closed, the spaces for vertical windows, which are now enclosed in cast iron glazed sashes, were covered with canvas, and the magnificent space was brilliantly lighted up with gas. The effect was indescribably grand. The VOL. III. G"], [48, "[A.D. 1835. 42 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF partial exclusion of daylight and the substitution of gas lamps gave the magnificent scene a dioramic effect. The spacious roof when the eye rested upon it for a few moments, seemed to rise into the air, and the distance from one end of the hall to the other appeared amazing. Upwards of 2,000 individuals sat down to dinner, and this immense company congregated at only a few days notice. The ladies gallery was filled, there being present about three hundred, including Mrs. Mayoress and many other ladies of distinction, which gave the hall a gay and cheerful appearance. In many instances 20s. and even 15s. premium were given for a ticket that had only cost 5s. For this fine building the corporation paid \u00a336,290, but from that amount \u00a315,000 was deducted for the old market, demolished by Mr. Grainger. On the following Saturday the markets were opened. The quantity of meat on offer exceeded anything previously seen in the north of England, and in the green market the flowers, fruit, and vegetables, were spread around in almost boundless profusion. It was splendidly decorated, and the fountains playing at intervals had a most striking effect. The bells rang out many a merry peal, and the occasion was regarded by every one as auspicious for the town. 1835 (October 26;. \u2014 Newcastle and the surrounding district was visited by a severe storm of wind and rain. In many exposed situations trees were torn up by the roots and other damage incurred. In the neighbourhood of Berwick the storm increased to a hurricane, attended with heavy rain and snow upon the hills. The Tweed, in the space of eight hours, rose full ten feet ; and the country was much inundated. Mr. Briggs, the keeper of Lambton Park, killed two deer with one shot from a rifle, though the animals were at the time 1 6 yards from each other The ball passed through the head of the nearest in an oblique direction, and hit the second on the side of the head, which it nearly penetrated. It was impelled with such force and precision that both animals died without a struggle and apparently at the same point of time. November 1. \u2014 The body of a young man about 19 years of age, named Thomas Thorsby, was found lying on the edge of a lime kiln at the Skinners burn, near Newcastle, quite dead, and with one of his legs completely burned off. He was addicted to intem perance, and frequently went to the lime kilns to sleep. November 2. \u2014As the mail coach was returning from Carlisle to Newcastle, it was upset at a place called Coastly Dean, about two miles west of Hexham. One of the wheel horses fell, and the remaining horses, with the coach, were precipitated into the ravine, the coach rolling over two or three times until it was stopped by a tree. The coachman, John Atkin, was thrown from his seat, and was so dreadfully mangled that he died almost immediately. Two outside passengers and the guard escaped by leaping off the coach. Two ladies and three children who were inside also escaped uninjured, although they rolled down the bank with the coach. The passeDgers and mail bags were forwarded to Newcastle in a chaise."], [49, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 43 1835 (November 5.) \u2014 As the train of railway waggons attached to the Rapid steam-engine were proceeding to Newcastle from Hexham, a cow in one ofthe cattle trucks became alarmed at the noise made by the engine, and actually leapt over the rails of the pen with the greatest ease. The poor animal, though she rolled down the steep bank, escaped without any injury ; and as soon as she recovered herself, she galloped after the waggons. The engine was stopped, and the train taken back to the station, where the cow was re-placed, and properly secured with ropes. November 9. \u2014 A golden eagle was winged, and with some difficulty secured by Mr. Davies, of Waterloo, near Blyth Link House, Northumberland. It was two and a half feet long, and the extent of its wings nearly seven feet. November 14.\u2014 The first number of the \" Berwick and Kelso Warder,\" a weekly Conservative journal, was published in Berwick by Mr. Thomas Ramsay, the proprietor. November \u2014 An explosion took place in Burdon Main Colliery, situated a little to the westward of North Shields, owing to the carelessness of a boy, who had neglected to close a door, by which a proper circulation of air had been prevented. A little after three o'clock in the afternoon, some of the workmen in the Low Main seam of the middle pit were alarmed, at what they too truely knew to be an explosion of foul air in the adjoining workings, and on proceeding to the spot, they found that as a deputy named James Campbell was going his usual rounds, an accumulation of foul air had taken fire at his candle, and produced the melancholy accident by which eleven human beings were instantly deprived of existence. The mine had always been so uncommonly free from foul air, that the men invariably worked with candles, a lamp never having been used in the workings. Unlike the generality of such accidents, the origin of the present explosion was soon discovered. It was found to have been caused by the negligence of the boy named Arkley, only ten years of age, and who was one of the sufferers. This poor lad had neglected to close a door, which it was his sole business to keep shut, and which even by standing open fifteen minutes would occasion a sufficient accumulation of foul air to cause the explosion. The force of the blast had been so exceedingly powerful that nothing seemed to have been able to resist its progress. No time was lost in endeavouring to get at the poor sufferers ; and at a considerable risk from the afterdamp the whole of the bodies were in a short time recovered. November 21. \u2014 A little before eleven o'clock at night, the corn and hay-stacks belonging to Mr. Martin Brown, at Scaffold hill, near Long Benton, Northumberland, were discovered to be on fire. When the alarm was given, Mr. Brown and his family were in bed. The whole ofthe stacks \u2014 5 of wheat, 5 of oats, 3 of hay, and 1 of tares \u2014 were entirely consumed ; and it was only by great exertions that the adjoining buildings were saved. The fire was occasioned by some sparks from the chimney of the herd's house."], [50, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1835. 44 1835 (November 21J\u2014 In consequence of the great quantity of rain which fell on this and the preceding day, the river Tyne rose very suddenly, overflowed its banks, and covered the low fields from near Ryton to the Redheugh. Some men, at the risk of their lives, saved a considerable number of sheep ; but many others were swept off the haughs, called the Hassocks, and drowned. Mr Henry Gill, of Williamstone, was unfortunately drowned in attempting to cross the North Tyne. November 23. \u2014 The branch railway having been completed from South Hetton Colliery, coal was first shipped at Hartlepool from that pit. November 25. \u2014 A most desperate attempt to eseape was made by three convicts in Newcastle goal, of the names of Rogers, Sterritt, and Legget. About seven o'clock, Smith, the turnkey was summoning them from the day-room to their usual night apartments, and whilst they were going up stairs, Legget seized a long brush, and with a violent blow he cut the turnkey's head. Smith, though stunned, was not incapable of giving an alarm, and assistance was soon got, by which the three desperadoes were heavily ironed. The attack was no doubt a preliminary step to an escape ; for on searching the room, they found the table broken up, and their bedding converted into a rope about 40 feet long. November 26. \u2014 An inquest was held at Redlees, in the parish of Alwinton, in the county of Northumberland, before Thomas A. Russel, esq., coroner, on view of the body of Mr. James Douglass, aged 67 years, a Highland stock farmer, residing at that place. It appeared that the deceased had left home about two o'clock on the Thursday preceding with two friends. Blind Burn was the last place they were at, and they left there in the evening ; and it being very wet and dark, and a thick fog setting down upon the hills, a person guided them so far over, the Fell. After leaving them they lost their way ; but the deceased's two companions arrived at the Reedless that night, and told the shepherds that their master was lost upon the Fell. They immediately went in search of him, and found him the following morning lying at the foot of a precipice, from 60 to 70 yards high, called Birkey Shank Hill, where he had gone over with his horse : both were quite dead. The deceased, though an eccentric character, was well known and much respected in that part of the country. November 28. \u2014 The new bridge at Alston was opened to the public, though not quite completed. This month, the Newcastle and North of England Insurance Company, with a capital of \u00a3300,000, was established. After an existence of about two years, tbe interest of the company was sold to the proprietors of the York and London Insurance Company. December 1.\u2014 The authorities of the extensive parish of Monk wearmouth met at nine o'clock in the morning for the purpose of riding the boundaries, a duty that had not been performed for forty-two years."], [51, "A.D. 1835.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 45 1835 (December 1). \u2014 Died, in South Shields, aged 100, Mrs. Cecilia Russell, many years employed in the salt pans there. December 8. \u2014 The corporation of Newcastle perambulated the new boundaries of that borough according to the Corporation Reform Act, which comprises the Westgate, Elswick, Jesmond, Heaton, and Byker. These townships now constitute part of the town and county of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. At ten o'clock iu the morning the company assembled on the Sandhill, with the right worshipful John Lionel Hood, esq., mayor, the town clerk, the sheriff, the stewards of the incorporated companies, and several gentlemen on horseback, in number upwards of one hundred, and returned to the Sandhill about three o'clock. Some of the horse men were thrown from their seats, but no accident of any moment occurred. December 10. \u2014 The common council of Newcastle agreed to sell to the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Company two acres of ground in Featherstone's field, and the Spital, for the purpose of erecting a railway station on the site. December 16. \u2014 In consequence of doubts having been enter tained whether Sunderland was a corporation entitled to the benefit of the Corporation Reform Act, the opinion of the attorney general was taken upon the point, and he replied in the affirmative. He also gave it as his opinion that the duties of chief officer, for carrying the provisions of that act into effect, devolved as a matter of right upon the freemen. In consequence of this opinion, a requisition, very numerously signed, was presented to B. Ogden, esq., the senion freemen soliciting him to act as chief officer on the occasion, but, in consequence of his age and indisposition, he politely declined the honour, as did also Messrs. B. Bray, C. Bramwell, and T. Parker, the next three in succession to Mr. Ogden. Mr. Spoor, however, the next freeman in seniority, acceded to the wishes of the requisitionists, and a public meeting was held on the above day, A. Wright, esq., in the chair, at which the thanks of the burgesses were voted to Mr. Spoor, and a committee was appointed to secure the benefit of the reform act to the borough. On the 17th another meeting was held, when Mr. A. Fenwick, Mr. R. Pemberton, Mr. Wm. Featherstonhaugh, and others agreed that there was no necessity for such a change as the act would produce, that the measure was for the reformation of old corporations, and not the creation of new ones ; and that Sunderland could not have a legally constituted corporation without a charter from the king. Messrs. Kidson, Abbs, and others replied, and theirs views were adopted by a large majority of the meeting. A quo warranto was soon after applied for by the opponents of the corporation, but, previous to the proceedings upon that writ being carried out, a clause was inserted in the Municipal Corporation Act Amendment Bill of the following session, expressly introducing the name of the town and prescribiug its boundaries. This wa3 expected to terminate the altercation, but the bill was thrown out by the House of Lords, August 18, 1836, and the legality of the"], [52, "46 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 183 : corporation was again a subject of doubt. Another quo warranto was issued September, 1836, against the Mayor (A. White, esq.), and as the county magistrates refused to acknowledge his acts, his worship sat at one hour and the magistrates at another in the same hall. After a protracted struggle the opponents of the corporation at length abandoned the field. 1835 ( December 21 ) . \u2014 A fire was discovered in a stable adjoining the farmhouse of Mr. William Taylor, of Nettlesworth Hall, about four miles north from Durham, and though the flames were prevented from extending, four valuable horses were destroyed. And on Thursday morning the 24th, as one of the men was leaving the house after breakfast, he discovered that every one of Mr. Taylor's stacks were in a blaze. A message was immediately sent to Durham for the fire-engines, but before they arrived, or other assistance could be obtained, the entire stock in the yard was con sumed, consisting of seventeen large wheat and oat stacks, one pea stack, and a hay stack. A thrashing machine was likewise burnt, besides great injury being done to the house and other premises. The total loss was estimated at upwards of \u00a31,000, only a small portion of which was insured. No doubt existed that both fires were the work of incendiaiies. December 25. \u2014 A beautiful piece of road leading from Westgate street, Newcastle, to the Scotswood Road, near the Infirmary, was opened. The subscription band of music, under the direction of Mr. Hudson, played in the front, a chariot, in which were Mr. Pearson, the surveyor, Mr. Dobson, the architect, &c, and several thousands followed after, much delighted with the improvement. This road was afterwards called Neville-street. The Central Station, with its beautiful portico and magnificent hotel, occupied by Mr. J. B. Jeffery, now forms one side of it. December 26. \u2014 At Newcastle, the first election of town coun cillors under the new Corporation Reform Act took place on Saturday, the 26th of December, 1835, and on the 28th the result was announced in the Guildhall by J.

December 31. \u2014 A gold watch was lost in afield near Cramlington. The field was soon after sown, twice harrowed, once rolled, and twice weeded, and the watch was found on the 15th of September, 1838, uninjured. 1836 (January 1). \u2014 The foundation-stone of a new chapel was laid in Linskill-street, North Shields, for the Methodist New Con nection. January 6. \u2014 The Grenville Bay, whaler, of Newcastle, arrived in the Tyne, an event which was hailed as a joyous occasion at Tynemouth and North Shields. The colours of the Loyal Standard and Good Design Associations were hoisted at their offices, and the sands at the Low-lights, and South Shields were crowded with spectators, who evinced the pleasure they felt by heartily cheering the vessel and crew as she gallantly sailed up the river. The Grenville Bay had three fish and about seventy tons of oil. Captain Taylor and his crew generally were in good health, considering the distressing privations they had endured. The cook, unfortunately, fell overboard on the passage home. The crew were put upon full allowance on the vessel getting clear of the ice on the 16th December, and there remained on arrival about a ton and a half of beef and pork, and sixteen cwt. of bread, which were calculated to support the crew, ou short allowance, till the beginuing of May. Captain Taylor stated, that after the Ilth November, the Grenville Bay, Lady Jane, and Norfolk continued to drift southward, having the Abram in sight. On the 20th, saw the land, distant about forty miles, in lat. 64. The prevailing winds being easterly, they continued to drift southward and set shoreward, and on the 8th of December they were in the mouth of Hudson's bay, Resolution island bearing east 15 or 20 miles. They were then carried by the current to Green island, and proceeded a considerable way in Ungava bay ; but, very fortunately, a current swept them along the land and round Batten's island, and carried them entirely out of Hudson's straits, where they were apprehensive at one time they would have to winter. There were frequent partial openings in the park of ice, and the ships took advantage to proceed eastward, and heavy swells aided their escape ; but the vessels received some heavy blows from the ice. When the Grenville Bay got into the water on the 16th, the Lady Jane was not in sight, having set by the current to the westward the preceding day. This was in latitude 58-50, and distant from the Labrador coast 30 miles. Several whales were seen in about lat. 61 30, and though the attempt was made to take them, it was unsuccessful, owing, probably, to the unfit state the crews were in for fishing.

Two masons who were working in the shaft at the time providentially escaped. 1836 (January 6;. \u2014 According to an admeasurement by the town surveyor, the streets of Newcastle-upon-Tyne were found to extend upwards of twenty-eight miles in length. January 9. \u2014 The Norfolk, whaler, of Berwick, arrived off that port this morning. The long-looked-for vessel anchored in the bay. The intelligence spread rapidly over the town, diffusing in its progress unalloyed gratification, and all classes were seen in groups travelling to the pier and ramparts to obtain a confirmation of the report. The Norfolk left the ice on the 14th of December, and arrived at the Orkney Islands on January 8th. The crew were free from disease, but generally very weak. They had been on short allowance from the beginning of October. January 16. \u2014 Died, at Monkend, near Croft, aged 85, Charles Colling, esq , the original breeder of Durham short-horned cattle. Of the surprisingly fat individuals of that variety numerous instances might be produced, but the one most deserving of notice was the far-famed Durham Ox, which was bred by the above Mr. Colling, at Ketton, in the year 1796. At an early age he indicated every disposition to fatten, and the expectations of the best judges were not disappointed. At five years old he was not only covered thick with fat upon all the principal points, but his whole carcase was loaded with it, and was then thought so wonderful an animal, and so far exceeding whatever had been seen before, that he was purchased to be exhibited as a show by Mr. Bulmer, of Harmley, near Bedale. in February, 1801, for \u00a3140; his living weight at that time being 220 stone, (14 lbs. to the stone). Mr. Bulmer got a carriage made to convey him in, and after travelling five weeks, sold him and the carriage at Rotheram to Mr. John Day, on the 4th of May, for \u00a3250. On the 14th of May, Mr. Day could have sold him for \u00a3525 ; on the 13th of June, for \u00a31,000 ; and on the 8th of July, for \u00a32,000, but Mr. Day preferred keeping him, and travelled with him nearly six years through the principal parts of England and Scotland, and arrived at Oxford in February, 1807, where, on the 19th, the Ox, by accident, dislocated his hip bone when he was obliged to be killed. January 21. \u2014 The reformed town council of Newcastle-upon- Tyne decided, by a majority of 25 to 21, that the mansion house, on the system heretofore practised, should be discontinued ; that the mayor should receive \u00a31,000 yearly, for the purpose of keeping up certain restricted hospitalities, &c. ; that the judges of assize should be lodged at the expense of the corporation, in a house either taken, built, or purchased, and that the mayor should reside in his own house or have the option of dwelling in the house afore mentioned during his mayoralty, excepting during the stay of the judges. January 23. \u2014 About three o'clock in the morning, the house of"], [57, "A.D. 1836.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 51 Mr. Dixon, glazier, Tyue-street, Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire by Mrs. Marshall, a washerwoman. The flames raged with such fury, that in a few minutes the whole house was in a blaze. Mr. Dixon, his wife, and six children, being unable to make their escape by the door, got out by the window. He had eight children, and at first hoped all their lives had been preserved ; unfortunately, however, two fine girls, one thirteen and the other nine years of age, perished before their situation was known. The house furni turr and \u00a3100 in money, together with all the stock in trade, were destroyed, and the whole family, who escaped in their night clothes, lost the rest of their apparel. A subscription was immediately entered into for their relief, and the amount collected ultimately covered the entire pecuniary loss which Mr. Dixon had sustained. In connection with this melancholy event, the following incident is worthy of being recorded : \u2014 A few days after the fire, Sir M. W. Ridley, bart., paid a visit to the Broad and Crown Glass Works, of which he was the principal proprietor, and, according to custom, presented a sum of money among the workmen to drink his health This pleasure, however, they generously denied themselves, and applied the gift in aid of the subscription for their unfortunate neighbour, Mr. Dixon. This having been made known to the worthy baronet, he was so delighted with it that he repeated his donation as a reward for their benevolence. 1836 (Jan.) \u2014 The new councillors were elected, under the muni cipal reform bill, for the city of Durham. The present govern ment of the city is vested in six aldermen and eighteen councillors, from whom the mayor is elected annually. Their jurisdiction in cludes the extra-parochial districts of the Castle precincts, the University, and St. Mary Magdalen ; the parishes of St. Mary in the South Bailey, St. Mary-le-Bow, St. Nicholas, and St. Giles or Gilligate ; aud parts of the parishes of St. Oswald and St. Mar garet or Crossgate, of which the latter includes part of the town ship of Framwellgate. The civic economy of Durham formerly was vested in a body of commissioners, of about 120 in number, including the dean and chapter. They were self elected, and irre sponsible. They had control over the paving, cleansing, draining, and lighting of the public streets of the city, aud a power of levying an annual rate of Is. in the pound upon all houses above or at \u00a35 rental, and 8d. on all below it. Some curious information relative to the customs of the freemen and the governing body of the city, was given by the town clerk, before the commissioners appointed by parliament, for instituting an enquiry respecting the various municipal corporations. 1836 (Jan. 23/ \u2014 During the whole of this day, Newcastle and the northern district generally was visited with a violent storm of wind from the south-west, which caused considerable damage to the buildings in that and the neighbouring towns, by blowing down chimneys, unroofing houses, &c. A large chimney at the Cowpen Quay salt works was blown down, the buildings being unroofed, and the walls greatly damaged. At North Shields the"], [58, "52 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1836. boats for some time were prevented from crossing the river, and the roofs of several houses were very much injured by the chim neys falling. Morpeth and the neighbourhood suffered consider able damage, a number of houses were unroofed and chimnies blown down. Meldon Park, the splendid seat of Isaac Cookson, esq., was partly unroofed and a quantity of glass brokeu. At Shawdon Hall, the seat of William Rawson, esq., a magnificent painted window was totally destroyed. A woman was blown out of a cart on Alnwick moor, and had her arm broken. Throughout the North and South Tyne the storm raged with great fury. At Capheaton, walls were blown down, and trees of the largest dimensions were torn up by the roots, one of which falling upon Miss Isabella Robson, killed her on the spot. At Newcastle, the steeple of St. John's church was partially blown down, and the windows of the Baptist chapel, Marlborough-crescent, received considerable damage. About six o'clock iu the evening, the chimney connected with the retorts at the gas works was blown down and fell upon the roof of the building, under which the workmen were at the time employed. At the moment of the accident the greater portion of the roof, together with tbe west gable, gave way, and fell with a tremendous crash. Six ol the men were covered with the ruins, all of whom were speedily extri cated. From the mass of materials blown down their escape with life seemed almost miraculous. At Berwick, the chapel in Golden Square was almost wholly unroofed, and the congregation were unable to meet in it on the following day. At Holy Island fully one half of the houses were unoofed ; a sheet of lead on the church, weighing about three tons, was rolled up, aud in consequence of the injury done to the building, no service was performed in it next day. At Sunderland, the entire roof of a house was blown off, and many similar occurrences took place in different parts of the country. 1836 (Jan 26;. \u2014 An inquest was held at the New Inn, Hope town, near Darlington, on view of the bodies of Jane, the wife, and Margaret and William, the two infant children of William Lister the younger, whitesmith, of the above place, who, on Monday afternoon, were returning from Darlington, up the depot branch of the Stockton and Darlington railway, when four very heavily laden waggons were coming down ; the little girl stept from the footpath into the main line, and the mother, with the other infant in her arms, stretched out her hand to rescue her from danger, when the waggons, coming instantly upon them, knocked the mother down, and the whole three were run over and killed upon the spot. January 28. \u2014 An awful explosion occurred in the celebrated Hetton colliery, near Houghton-le-Spring, by which twenty human beings lost their lives. Upwards of one hundred persons were employed in the pit at the time, but owing to the accident being confined to one of the workings \u2014 the Downs pit \u2014 the number was less than might have been expected. January.\u2014 A very substantial bridge, of good workmanship,"], [59, "A.D. 1836.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 53 was finished across the river Wansbeck, at the Morpeth Grange Ford. This made the fourth bridge across that river, all within a mile and a half. 1836 (January 29;. \u2014 Died, at the advanced age of 91 years, William Scott, Baron Stowell, of Stowell Park, in the county of Gloucester, D.C.L., F.R.S., and F.S.A., Master of the Faculties, and a member of the Privy Council. Lord Stowell was born on the 17th of October, 1745, at Heworth, in the county of Durham. His mother was Jane, daughter of Henry Atkinson, hoastmau, and his father, William Scott, a substantial coal-fitter and merchant, residing in Love-lane, Quayside, Newcastle. Owing to the rebellion tbat broke out in 1745, and the alarm then prevalent in Newcastle, which had been fortified against tbe Pretender, his mother, when in an advanced state of pregnancy, was lowered in a basket from the town wall, into a boat which lay in waiting to convey her to Heworth, on the southern shore of the Tyne. Here she was delivered of a boy and a girl, twins, William, afterwards Lord Stowell, and Barbara, who died young. William was educated at the Royal Grammar School, in Newcastle, but at the early age of sixteen he availed himself of his claim as a native of the county of Durham to a scholarship in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and before attaining his seventeenth year he 'was entered as a student in the middle temple. In November, 1764, he took his bachelor's degree. In the following month, he was elected probationary fellow of Oxford College, and further, one of the greatest compliments that could have been paid to his learning, he was at the age of twenty, appointed college tutor. In 1767, he took his master's degree, and in 1772, May 30, he became B.C.L., having determined to follow the civil law as a profession. In the year 1774, he was elected Camden reader of ancient history, vacant by the death of Mr. Warneford, and never were the duties of the professorship so ably fulfilled since its first institution in 1662. His lectures are said to have been attended by the largest concourse of academics ever known, who were equally delighted with the classical eloquence of his style, the admirable arrangement of his subject, and the luminous informa tion conveyed by him. In these particulars they successfully competed with the course of lectures delivered by the Vinerian professor, Blackstone, which they equalled in popularity. Of Scott's merits in this office both Dr. Parr aud Gibbon have written in the highest terms of commendation. Until 1779 he remained at Oxford ; but in that year he took the degree of D.C L., and enrolled himself a member of the College of Doctors of Law, practising in the Ecclesiastical and Admirality Courts. Shortly after settling in the metropolis he became enrolled amongst the wits in an age that could boast of Dr. Johnson, Sir William Jones, and Sir Joshua Reynolds. With Johnson, indeed, aud Sir Joshua Reynolds, he was soon on terms of sincere friendship, which continued till the day of their death. His lordship left a fortune of nearly \u00a3250,000, a sum which, though very large, could hardly"], [60, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1836. 54 be termed surprisingly so, considering the income he had eDJoyed for so long a period, and his extremely prudent habits. He carried, indeed, his views on economy so far that he refused to make his son a sufficient allowance to enable him to marry, and the disappointment was said to have led Mr. Scott into intemperate habits, under which his constitution gave way, and he died about two months before his father. In one thing, however, Lord Stowell was exceedingly liberal \u2014 his love of sights \u2014 and many hundred pounds were expended by him in visiting every exhibition, however contemptible, which appeared in London. But in his court the eccentricities of his character were forgotten in the solidity of his judgments and the inimitable felicity of his language, and he has left behind him an imperishable name in the records of English civil law. There is a good portrait of Lord Stowell in the Guildhall, Newcastle. 1836 (February 7). \u2014 A new chapel, belonging to the Methodist New Connexion, was opened at Sheriff-hill, near Gateshead, when the liberal sum of \u00a318 2s. 6d. was collected. February 12.\u2014 Mr. Mark Scott, overman at Fawdon colliery, was blown down the shaft of that pit and killed on the spot. February 16. \u2014 A dinner was given to a number of gentlemen, by Mr. Joseph Armstrong, brewer, in the mash tub of an extensive brewery which he had just completed in Hanover-square, Newcastle. Sixteen gentlemen were conveniently accommodated in this singular dining room. February 17. \u2014 Newcastle aud neighbourhood were visited by a tremendous hurricane from the N.N.E. accompanied by heavy showers of snow and sleet, there was also a vivid flash of lightning followed by a loud peal of thunder. The river Tyne rose to an extraordinary height, overflowing its banks in many places, and causing considerable alarm in Shields harbour by forcing several vessels from their mooring. At Sunderland, the wind being from the N.E. produced the highest tide ever remem bered in that port by the oldest inhabitant. At Seaton Carew, the water flowed through the town like a river, and at Hartlepool, the sea rose seven feet above the hightest tide mark recorded. At Middlesbro' immense damage was done, the pottery alone suffering to the amount of \u00a31,000. Avery great number of vessels were wrecked all along the coast. February 17. \u2014 About six o'clock in the evening, a most alarming fire broke out at Warton farm, near Rothbury, occupied by Mr. Robt. Dickinson, by which seventeen corn stacks, the barn, and the thrashing machine were totally consumed. The devouring element spiead with such awful rapidity that in less than half an hour, the whole presented one tremendous blaze. Mr. Dickinson had fortunately insured his property only a few weeks before. February 20. \u2014 A barbarous murder was committed in the village of Lumley, in the county of Durham, on the person of Richard Taylor, a shoemaker, in the 76th year of his age. The deed was supposed to have been perpetrated between seven and"], [61, "a.d. 1836.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 55 eight o'clock in the evening. The body was found by two boys on the following morning. The head had been beaten till almost flat, and the brains were scattered about the ground. The unfor tunate old man, who was of an inoffensive disposition, and much respected, was robbed of between ten and twenty shillings in silver. Two men were apprehended on suspicion, but were afterwards discharged. 1836 (Feb. 21).\u2014 Died, in his 70th year, at Auckland Castle, the Right Rev. William Van Mildert, the last Count Palatine bishop of Durham. Dr. Van Mildert was the grandson of Abraham Van Mildert, of Amsterdam, who settled as a merchant in London, and resided in the parish of Great St. Helen's. His son, Cornelius, who resided at Newington, Surrey, and died in 1799, had by Martha, daughter of William Hill, of Vauxhall, esq., three sons, of whom the second and sole survivor was the bishop. His first curacy was at Sherburne, Oxfordshire, but iu 1812 he was appointed preacher in Lincoln's Inn, and in the following year Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. In 1819, he was made bishop of Llandaff, in 1820 dean of St. Paul's, and in 1826 bishop of Durham. His productions as a theological writer were nume rous, and rank in the first order, his edition of the works of \" Waterland \" supplying a defect which had long existed in ecclesiastical literature. His charity was unbounded, every corner of his diocese bearing testimony to his liberality ; but his munifi cent donations to the University of Durham were the most con spicuous evidences of his bounty, and notwithstanding his princely income, his lordship died, comparatively speaking, a poor man. Provision for his amiable widow arose chiefly from her beneficial interest in a life policy, to be realised by his lordship's demise. On the whole, it is very difficult to speak justly of this eminent person without seeming to incur the charge of flattery. His under standing was vigorous and comprehensive, his learning accurate and deep, his apprehension quick, his temper highly sensitive, but generous, kind, and forgiving in the last degree. Perhaps no man ever lived who could dismiss an angry emotion more readily from his mind. To forgive injuries was the habit of his life, to resent them he was never known. But, after all, the grand element of this fine character was a deep, habitual, and pervading sense of religion. This was the foundation-stone of the whole fabric ; on no other principle, indeed, could such a character have been formed. The labour of his life and the faculties of his mind were steadily directed to the maintenance and vindication of Christian truth. The remains of this excellent prelate were interred in a vault pre pared in the nave of the cathedral church of Durham. Hitherto no Protestant bishop had been buried there. The funeral took place on the lst of March. February 24. \u2014 Berwick-upon-Tweed and neighbourhood were visited with a tremendous gale. The violent north-east wind impelled the waves so fearfully upon the shore, that they were only prevented from inundating the streets by the strength of the"], [62, "56 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1836. ancient walls. In Chillingham Park upwards of 1,300 trees were blown down; and a venerable tree which had stood 400 years in the church-yard at Alnwick, and was called the Broom Tree, was also destroyed. 1836 (March 2J\u2014 At about eight o'clock at night the extensive spinning mill of Messrs. Clarke, Plummer, and Co., at the Ouse burn, Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire. Seven fire engines were speedily on the spot, and a plentiful supply of water being at hand, the flames were confined to that part of the mill where they had originated, but the machinery, models, &c, were much injured, and the total damage did not amount to less than \u00a34,000. March 12. \u2014 About this time an extraordinary mania began to develope itself for the establishment of joint stock companies amongst commercial men and others who dabbled in shares. And on this day was issued the prospectus of the \" Northumberland aud Durham District Banking Company.\" The capital was proposed to be half-a-million, in 50,000 shares of \u00a310 each, upwards of 40,000 shares were subscribed for in less than a month. The eager anxiety to obtain shares in this undertaking was almost unparalleled, hundreds of respectable individuals being refused an allotment. The utmost amount of shares allowed to each applicant was 100, and one shilling per share to be paid on their receipt. A few days after the shares had been alloted speculation rose to a tremendous pitch, as high as five pounds premium being paid for a share, so that a person with only five pounds could convert it into five hundred. At a meeting held in Newcastle on the 12th of May, the company was declared established. On the 18th May the directors issued a notice that arrangements had been made with Messrs. J. Backhouse and Co., for the incorpora tion of their Newcastle branch with the new establishment, and the bank was opened for business on the lst June, under the management of Mr. Jonathan Richardson in the premises previously occupied by Backhouse & Co. March 16. \u2014 The boiler of the engine at Cramlington colliery burst, and three persons lost their lives by the accident. A young man named John Dawson, who had charge of the engine, was one of the sufferers, and the other two were boys on their way to school. March 18. \u2014 As Robert and Philip Marshall, and Alexander Hall, of Hallington, in the parish of St. John Lee, Northum berland, were digging for coals uear Kirkheaton, they found a human skeleton in a deep hole under a large flat stone, the head had been put downwards, and the arms and legs had been bent upon the body. From the appearance of the remains they were supposed to have been those of a tall woman, and there was little doubt from the position in which they were found, and the nature of the place, that she had been murdered. March. \u2014 This month, in clearing away the sand bank east of Morpeth Castle, the workmen dug up several cannon balls, of one and two pounds weight, which were supposed to have been fired during the siege of that place by Montrose, in the year 1644."], [63, "A.D. 1836.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 57 1836 (April 1). \u2014 A spacious new chapel was opened for worship in Gateshead, for the use of the Methodist New Connexion. April 2. \u2014 Mr. William Falla, nurseryman, of Gateshead, left his home, and was never afterwards seen alive. On the first of May his body was accidentally discovered in a very shocking state in Ravensworth Wood, near Ladypark farm. It was then found that the deceased had committed suicide by piercing his windpipe with a pen-knife, an instrument which he had closed and replaced in his pocket after committing the act. April 25. \u2014 The bridge across the Tyne at Wylam was formally opened. It is of wood, supported by stone pillars, and was built by subscription. It affords great accommodation, being passable by both foot passengers and carriages, for which a small toll is charged. April 27. \u2014 This morning, a coble belonging to Whitburn, in the county of Durham, containing two men named Curry \u2014 father and son \u2014 and two men named Henderson \u2014 brothers \u2014 put off to sea, in order to procure some lobster boxes they had placed near the rock ends the previous evening. A heavy sea unfortu nately struck the cable which immediately swamped, and the crew perished before help could be rendered. The men each left a widow, and in all sixteen children. May 1. \u2014 The handsome and conveniently situated chapel belonging to the Methodist New Connexion, in Hood-street, Newcastle, was opened for divine service, when sermons were preached on that aud the following day, during which days the sum of \u00a3166 was collected. May 2. \u2014 The Newcastle new police force, under the superin tendence of Mr. Stephens, went on duty for the first time, but they did not appear in uniform dress until the following week. jfay 7. \u2014 This morning, the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Adam son. of Bishopwearmouth Pans, was discovered to be on fire. The flames spread from the joiner's shed, where they originated, to a large stock of timber and to a ship that was building, the former was entirely and the latter partially consumed. As soon as the alarm was given, the populace ran in thousands to the place. A large malting occupied by Mr. Thomas Taylor, which adjoined the premises, and which contained upwards of 5,000 bushels of malt, was also totally destroyed. j/ay 9. \u2014 An alarming fire occurred at Hartlepool, on the premises of Mr. Paddon, druggist, and a large amount of injury was done before the flames were subdued. May 15. \u2014 That striking, and at all times interesting phenomenon a solar eclipse \u2014 occurred, and Alnwick being the most favourably situated town in the kingdom for observing it, Lord Prudhoe, Sir James Smith, and other astronomers were invited there for that purpose. The day was as fine as ever shone from the heavens, not a cloud being visible, and the progress of the eclipse could be most minutely traced. A temporary observatory was VOL. in. t"], [64, "58 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1836. erected near Brislee Tower, and Lord Prudhoe provided a number of telescopes for the use of the public. 1836 (May 2i;.\u2014 A prospectus was issued of the \" Newcastle Commercial Banking Company.\" The proposed capital was \u00a3500,000 in 50,000 shares of \u00a310 each, but it was ultimately fixed at \u00a3100,000, of which \u00a375,000 were called _ up. The bank was opened in the beginning of August, on premises at the Bridge-end, and issued its own notes until 1S40, when the Bank of England paper was substituted. In July, 1845, the capital was reduced to \u00a350,000 by the repayment of \u00a32 10s. per share to the shareholders. May 23. \u2014 A prospectus of the \" Newcastle Joint Stock Bank\" appeared. The capital was fixed at \u00a3500,000 in \u00a325 shares, but the latter weie afterwards reduced to \u00a310 per share, and a large number were never subscribed for. The bank commenced business in the Royal Arcade, on Saturday, July 2nd. May 23. \u2014 A prospectus was issued of the \" Durham County Coal Company,\" capital half-a-million, in \u00a350 shares.

June 2. \u2014 The skeleton of a man was discovered about three feet below the surface, in the immediate vicinity of Peter Allan's tavern, at Marsden Rock, near South Shields. The body appeared to have been interred with care, there being flat smooth stones laid beneath the head. A pistol bullet was found in the chest, and a fragment about three inches in length of a sharp pointed steel instrument, had pierced the vertebra of the neck, from which it was evident that death had arisen from violence. June 10. \u2014 The Kirkharle estates in Northumberland, which had been in the possession of the Loraine family for upwards of six hundred years, were sold by auction in London, for \u00a357,000. The purchaser was Thomas Anderson, esq., of Benwell Tower, nephew ofthe late Major Anderson, of Newcastle. June 11. \u2014 An advertisement was published for the purpose of obtaining subscriptions to a proposed magnificent suspension bridge, with an approach from near St. Nicholas' church, New castle, across the river, to West-street, Gateshead, thereby avoiding the steep and dangerous hills Dean-street and the Bottle Bank."], [65, "A.D. 1836.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 59 1836 (June li;. \u2014 A prospectus was issued \" for converting the bank of Messrs.

Claytor, bart., and Co., at Sunderland. June 18. \u2014 An awful thunderstorm occurred at Durham. The lightning was terrific, and the rain fell in torrents. One house in Church-street, near the New Inn, was struck by the electric fluid, and the bed, which two men had just vacated, was shivered to pieces.

June 24 \u2014 The family of William Barnell, tallow chandler, Dur ham, were disturbed by the cries of an infant, and on going to the room from which the cries proceeded, they found that the child had been severely bitten by a rat, which had knawed the flesh to the bone from one of the ringers as far as the wrist. It had also commenced an attack on the neck when disturbed by the family. June 26. \u2014 The last performance in the Theatre Royal, Mosley street, Newcastle, took place before a crowded audience, when the comedy of \" Sweethearts and Wives\" was performed, followed by a petite comedy, entitled \" Picturesque.\" The theatre was first opened on January 21, 1788, and Mr. Grainger commenced to pull it down on Saturday, November 5, 1836, when the principal portion of the site was thrown into Grey-street. June 28. \u2014 That portion of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway between Hexham and Haydon Bridge was opened with considerable splendour. Two trains \u2014 one drawn by the Hercules locomotive, manufactured by Stephenson, and the second, consisting of six railway coaches and eleven trucks, drawn by the Samson engine, manufactured by Messrs. Hawthorn \u2014 left Blaydon about eleven o'clock with the directors and their friends, and the party arrived at Haydon Bridge a little before two. At various parts of the line flags were hoisted, and discharges of guns took place as the trains passed, and scarcely a spot on either side of the river which commanded a view of the procession was without its group of spectators, who, by their acclamations, testified the interest they took in the scene. The numerous company spent a delightful day without the slightest accident."], [66, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1836. 60 1836 (July). \u2014 Notwithstanding the five new joint stock banks and other undertakings established in Newcastle, tbe following additional prospectuses were issued : \u2014 The Tyne East India Com pany, capital \u00a3100,000; the North of England Union Sawing Mill Company, \u00a35,000 ; the Newcastle and Northumberland Coal Company, \u00a3300,000; the North of England Marine Insurance Company, \u00a3150,000 ; the Tyne Marine Insurance Company, \u00a3150,000 ; the Joint Stock Liberal Newspaper Company, \u00a3-5,000; the Great North Road Suspension Bridge Company, for uniting Newcastle and Gateshead at a high level, \u00a3125,000; the Grand Eastern Union Railway Company, from Newcastle to Durham, \u00a3800,000 ; and other schemes. July 3. \u2014 Newcastle and neighbourhood was visited by nn awful storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied by rain. At Kirk whelpington, the electric fluid struck a large ash tree, and shivered it from top to bottom, carrying the splinters, bark, &c, to a great distance. At Whitleys, near Blanchland, eighteen sheep were killed by the lightning. The storm also visited Alnwick and neighbourhood ; and Mr. Elliott, of Shankhall, near that place, had a valuable horse killed. July 8. \u2014 Sir John Walsham, the assistant poor law commis sions for the district, formed the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Poor Law Union. July 11. \u2014 As George Wilkinson, Esq., of Durham, was driving his lady and Mrs., Wilkinson, senior, in the direction of Seaham, in a pbaoton, he attempted to cross the Seaham railway when a train of waggons was descending the inclined plane. The horse became restive, and would not proceed, consequently, the fore most waggon struck the phaeton, which, together with the inmates and horse, were hurried along at a fearful rate down the incline. A man who was in the waggon snatched Mrs. Geo. Wilkinson from her perilous situation, and placed her in safety beside himself. Mr. W. soon after fell from his seat, and the horse became disen gaged from the vehicle, which was rapidly falling to pieces from the violence of the collision. Mrs,. Wilkinson, senior, however, kept her seat, and gently rolled off at the bottom of the h'ill when the waggons had almost ceased to move, after having been impetu ously carried along a distance of about 180 yards. The carriage was broken into at least fifty pieces ; and, wonderful to relate, none of the party received any serious injury. July 15. \u2014 Died, at Richmond, Surrey, in his 58th year, Sir Matthew White Ridley, of Biagdon and Heaton, in the county cf Northumberland, bart., M.P. for Newcastle.

He sat durino eight parliaments, and for the space of 24 years. At the two last elections he had to encounter a poll, but the result proved the high"], [67, "A.D. 1836.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 61 esteem in which he was held by his fellow townsmen. His principles were those of the old whigs ; and in his address at tho last election he declared himself a sincere and practical reformer ; but iii the extreme measures which characterised the later periods of his political career they inclined to conservatism. Sir Matthew married, August 13, 1803, Laura, youngest daughter of George Hawkins, esq,, by whom he had six sons' aud six daughters. A portrait of Sir Matthew, painted by James Ramsay, esq., has been published, drawn on stone by W. Taylor. 1836 (July 19).\u2014 The installation' of the Right Rev. Dr. Maltby, who had been translated from the sea of Chichester to that of Durham, took place in the cathedral of his diocese ; the Hon. aud Rev. Dr. Wellesley acting as proxy for the bishop.

E. Headlam and John Spedding, esqrs. At the close of the poll on the 27th, the numbers were for Mr. Hodgson 1576, and for Captain Blackett 1528. 949 freemen voted for the successful candidate, aud 468 for his opponent. July 29. \u2014 Newcastle and its neighbourhood were visited by a tremendous storm of thunder, lightning, and rain. The rain during the afternoon, aud indeed throughout the night, was so violent and continuous as to flood the Tyne and its tributary streams to such a height as had not been equalled for many years. Many sheep and other farming stock were carried away. A great quantity of hay was hst from the lowlands; aud several fields of potatoes aud turnips completely destroyed. Mr. Hall, a farmer at Newburn, had a thirty acre field of hay entirely lost by a deposit of sand brought down by the flood. August 8. \u2014 The Brandling Junction Railway was commenced at the Felliug, near Gateshead. The first turf was cut in the presence of R. W. Brandling, esq , and a party of gentlemen, who had assembled to witness the first effort to forward this desirable undertaking. August 10. \u2014 The foundation-stone ofthe bridge across the Tyne at Bywell, was laid by T. W. Beaumont, esq. But the hilarity of the day was damped by an unfortunate accident. Orders had been given to blow up one of tbe piers of the old bridge, and while two men were in the act of charging a bore with gunpowder, a spark caught the powder, which blew up, and so dreadfully mangled one of the men that he died in a few minutes ; the other was also frightfully injured. August 1 1 . \u2014 The king granted his royal license to John Hodgson, of Elswick House, M.P. for Newcastle, in compliance"], [68, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a D. 1836. 62 with the will of Elizabeth Arthur Hinde, of Ovingham, in the county of Northumberland, to assume tbe surname of Hinde iu addition to that of Hodgson. 1836 (August 22). \u2014 A boynamed George Young, aboutseven years of age, while sitting behind his trap door, down one of the Cowpen pits, a large stone, several tons weight, fell upon him from the roof, and before he was got out life was extinct. September 13. \u2014 A lady residing in Monkwearmouth, had, when a child about four years of age, two small pebbles put into her ears by an elder sister in play, which being pressed too far could not be extracted. The circumstance was attended with slight pain and swelling of the glands ; and one of the stones, about seven years afterwards, was voided through the same aperture. Lately the lady experienced a slight pain in the ear, and to her astonish ment, on this day the other stone appeared within the cavity of the ear, and was with ease extracted, after having remained in the head for upwards of 44 years. September 25. \u2014 A hare, without being pursued, deliberately ran through the village of Bumopfield, and sprang through a window of the constable's house, who exercised his authority in detaining poor puss, as well on account of her indiscretion as for the damage. v September 25. \u2014 The Newcastle Courant was reduced from 7d. to 4Jd. September 30. \u2014 One of the most wanton, cold blooded, aud atrocious murders which, perhaps, has ever been recorded, was perpetrated upon a defenceless man named Lee, iu the glass house belonging to Mr. Price, Pipewellgate, Gateshead. Lee lived in Gallo wgate, Newcastle, and belonged to the Northumberland and Newcastle Volunteer Cavalry, and the occurrence took place during the performance of the usual eight days duty of that corps. On the eveniug of the above day the unfortunate man was intoxicated, and by some means or other had found his way into the glasshouse, where he fell asleep upon a large box. Here he was fountl by three young men, who were partially acquainted with him. After covering him with straw, they procured hot cinders from the furnace, and ignited it, At this moment Lee awoke, but almost immediately relapsed into deep slumber. It would appear that the first attempt to set fire to the unconscious man had failed ; they, however, seemed bent upon his destruction. More straw was collected, with hot cinders from the furnace, and tossed upon the helpless being. They then ran out, but suddenly returning were met by Lee himself enveloped in flames, and crying out '\" Fire.\" The poor fellow rushed along the street, and in his bewilderment and agony rushed back again to the glasshouse. By this time some of the neighbouring inhabitants had been drawu to the place by his cries, who ultimately extinguished the flames.

The roof of the office, part of the roof of the foundry, and the joiners' shop were destroyed, together with a large number of models. October. \u2014 Some time during this month, Mr. William Mather, a respectable builder of Newcastle, came into the possession of an immense fortune, amounting to between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3300,000 sterling. About twenty years previous, Alexander Adams, Esq., who resided in Northumberland-street, Newcastle, bequeathed an immense fortune, amassed in commerce, to his natural son, resident in India. The fortunate devisee did not live long to enjoy his wealth, but died at Calcutta, a bachelor, leaving all he possessed to his cousin, Mr. Thomas Naters, who was settled near New York, in the United States of America. This last-named gentle man died some time this month, in Switzerland, leaving under his will those immense riches to Mr. Mather. The Swiss authorities, however, were loth to part with the money, and put in an enor mous claim for legacy duty, amounting to \u00a350,000. This pro voked an official remonstrance from the British Government, and it being shown that Mr. Naters was not a naturalised subject of the Swiss Government, the authorities moderated their demands, and the matter was ultimately settled by Mr. Mather suffering himself to be mulct of \u00a312,000. October 8. \u2014 William Sample, esq., agent to Sir Edward Blackett, bart., of Matfen, and his assistants, perambulated, on behalf of the hon. bart , the boundaries of the ancient and extensive manor of Willimoteswick, near Haltwhistle.

He had been missing two days, and is supposed to have fallen into the river. On the day of Hutchinson's interment an awfully sudden death occurred in Barnard Castle. A young man named Carnell sent a boy to meet tho funeral procession, and requested him to run forward and tell him when it reached the town. Before the boy returned, however, Carnell himself was a corpse. November 6 \u2014 The chapel at Horton, near South Shields, was opened for divine service, by the Rev.

On the 13th November the annual sermon for the benefit of the Infirmary was preached at St. Nicholas' church, by the bishop, to one of the most numerous congregations ever seen at that church, when his lordship delivered a most impressive and highly talented discourse. The collection amounted to \u00a379 7s., being a much larger sum than was ever collected on any similar occasion. 1836 (November li;.\u2014 The following gentlemen were elected councillors for the borough of Newcastle, to supply extraordinary vacancies caused by some being elected aldermen, disqualifications, and death : \u2014 St. Nicholas' Ward\u2014 Mr. W.

A company was formed in January, 1834, to raise the sum of \u00a36,900 by 345 shares of \u00a320 each, 90 of which shares were taken by the corporation as the price ofthe land, which consists of 15 acres, situate at a short distance beyond Carlton-terrace, between the New Road and Benton Lane. From the road there is a massive archway entrance betwixt the towers of two convenient chapels, built of beautifully veined freestone, after a chaste design by J. Dobson, esq., forming a very ornamental structure at this approach to the town, The cemetery is laid out and planted with great taste, and enclosed with a lofty wall. The first interment in this cemetery was that of Margaret Redford, daughter of Mr. George Hoy, formerly a grocer in Newcastle. November. \u2014 In a letter from the Bishop of Durham, read at a meeting of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, ou the division of the see, the rev. prelate, alluding to the education of the county, says : \" Knowing, as I do, the lamentable deficiency of the means of education and divine worship in many parts of this diocese, I cannot but feel that the funds placed at my disposal will be far from enabling me to do the good I could wish. Nevertheless, I indulge the hope that the deficiency of my means will not escape the recol lection ofthe Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but that in the distribution of the surplus revenues of the see or chapter, they will have especial regard to the peculiar and pressing wants ofthe inhabitants of these two counties.\" The patronage of four livings in Yorkshire were transferred, at this time, from the see of Durham to Ripon, namely, Birkby, Leake, Osmotherley, and Craike.

November 19. \u2014 A number of fishermen, of Hartlepool, were placed in imminent danger, in consequence of a boisterous wind having suddenly arisen while they were engaged in their perilous employment. Twenty-six boats were at sea, each containing three men, and there seemed at one time little chance of any of them escaping destruction. The life boat was launched and manned by a gallant crew, proceeded to their assistance. One boat was swamped, and her crew, consisting of three brothers named Davidson, were observed from the shore struggling in the sea and clinging to their vessel. During this affecting scene the shrieks of the women, the cries of the children, and the mental agony of old Davidson, the father of the above named young men, and who had before lost two sons at sea, were most appalling. They were, however, happily picked up by some of the other fishermen, and landed in salety. The remainder of the fishing cobles also reached the shore under convoy of the life boat without having lost a man. November 23. \u2014 A meeting was convened in the town chamber, Gateshead, Alderman Pollock in the chair, when it was resolved to establish a mechanics' institute for the borough. The meeting, which was numerous and respectable, was addressed by Messrs. Rowntree, Brockett, William L. Harle, and others. Upwards of seventy individuals were immediately enrolled as members, and several valuable contributions in the shape of books, &c, and cash to a considerable amount.

November 26. \u2014 The \"Newcastle Standard,\" newspaper, edited by Mr. Charles Larkin, was published, but was discontinued April the 15th, 1837. November. \u2014 This month, a singular discovery of a seam of coal was made in Berwick. While some alterations were being made in the yard behind Mr. Ralph Smith's house, in Bridge street, the workmen dug up a quantity of coal. Curiosity dictated a further search, aDd at the depth of about six feet from the surface they came upon a seam of coal, 3 feet 1 inch in thickness. The quality was put to the test, and pronounced to be excellent. December \u2014 This month, as a family of the name of Fawcus were removing from a village near Darlington, they observed a redbreast following them.

It continued its flight until it arrived at their place of destination, a distance of about 18 miles, and finally found its way into the house which the family were about to occupy. 1836 (December 1). \u2014 A meeting of the inhabitants of Sunderland was held in the Exchange Buildings in that town, the Hon. and Rev. G. V. Wellesley in the chair, for the purpose of promoting the erection of a memorial in honour of Rowland Burdon, Esq., as the sounder of the celebrated iron bridge at Sunderland. Resolutions were passed, and a special committee appointed for the purpose of carrying them into effect. December 2. \u2014 The inhabitants of Darlington were alarmed by a special messenger from Sadberge, about five miles distant from that town, announcing that the house of Mr. Christopher Richmond, of Sadberge, tanner, was on sire. When the firemen arrived, an awful spectacle presented itself, the fire having made devastating progress. The flames continued to rage with great fury till about three o'clock in the morning, when they were subdued. The whole of the furni ture, documents, &c, were destroyed. The family escaped with some difficulty. December 5 \u2014 During a violent gale of wind, a woman, residing in Saltwellside, near Gateshead, was unfortunately killed by the fall of a chimney. The Joint Stock Banking Company's premises in the Royal Arcade, Newcastle, suffered in the glass domes by chimneys falling in. Part of a high wall in Percy-street was blown down, and the river for several hours was completely impassible. Several persons were thrown down in the streets and received serious injuries. A scullerman at Shields was driven to sea and lost. December. \u2014 Eaily in this month, a mural monument was erected in St. Nicholas' church, Newcastle, by order of Lord Eldon, in memory of his father, the late William Scott. The monument was designed and executed by Mr. Elger, sculptor, Park-lane, London. It is studiously plain, but very neat, being surmounted with a beautifully-executed vase, partially covered with diapery, and on the tablet is the following inscription : \u2014 '' In Memory of Mr. William Scott, Freeman and Hoastman of this town, who was buried in All Saints' church, November, 1776.

The deceased sprung from a very ancient family in Northumberland, was lady of an extensive manor about Haltwhistle, and possessed property worth \u00a32,000 per annum. She was well educated, and brought up in every respect as a lady of good fortune ought to be, On the death of her only brother and sister, Miss Cuthbertson became exceedingly strange in her manners, and eccentric in her conduct. She chose for her abode the second storey of a miserable house in Haltwhistle, the door of which was nearly constantly locked, and many of the windows bricked up to keep out the gaze of inquisitive people. Towards her tenants she behaved in very peculiar manner. It was said that some had not paid any rent for a great number of years, and others had paid a portion of the rent due, and both these descriptions of tenants she allowed to live upon their respec tive tenures because they owed her money, but those who paid the whole of their rents she immediately discharged. During the last few years of her life she declined transacting any business in the most positive manner, and no inducements or persuasions could pre vail upon her to abandon her system of non-interference with the world.

There being a high wind from the north-east, the snow drifted very much, consequently the roads to the north and south of Newcastle soon became impassible. The greatest obstructions in the north were between Felton aud Alnwick, and from Bucton Burn to Berwick. The coaches which set out for the north on the 26th were all stopped \u2014 the Highflyer at Weldon-bridge, and the Chevy Chase near Ponteland. A passenger in the Chevy Chase furnished particulars of the journey, which reflect great credit on the activity and perseverance of the guard, John Barron, and the coachman, Jonathan Bowron. The coach left Newcastle at eight o'clock on Monday morning, and reached Edinburgh at ten o'clock on Thursday night. The snow in some parts of their route was twelve feet high, and it required three days to perform three stages. Notwithstanding these obstructions, the guard and coachman persevered, and sometimes with four, sometimes with six hores, by diverging occasionally into fields, and carrying the coach frequently over hedges and ditches, they contrived to reach their goal in the time mentioned.

Her ladyship also endowed the erection with the sum of \u00a350 per annum. December. \u2014 The quantity of coals shipped from the Tyne in the year 1836, London and coastwise alone, amounted to 754,961 Newcastle chaldrons. Of the land and water sale of coals on the Tyne no public entry is made, but it has been ascertained that it approximates 200,000 Newcastle chaldrons annually. The over sea sale is not here taken into account ; so that the Tyne vend cf coals for the year may be safely put down at 770,000 Newcastle chaldrons of 53 cwt. each, or two millions forty thousand five hundred tons. Beduced to tons, the vend of the Wear for the same period is one million fifty-five thousand four hundred and thirteen, being rather more than half the enormous vend of the Tyne. 1837 (January 2). \u2014 A human skeleton was found about eighteen inches below the surface of tbe nort-east side of Sunderland moor, and from its appearance there could be little doubt but that it had been placed there after a violent death.

January 3. \u2014 The sale of the mansion-house furniture, pictures, plate, &c, commenced this day, pursuant to the decision of the corporate body on the 7th December, 1836. The proceeding met the approbation of some, but was highly disapproved of\" by the mass, who very justly regarded the disposal of property left in trust for the use of the corporation for ever as an act indefensible, and the more so when it is remembered that the ultimate decision was arrived at by the trifling majority of four. The sale was but poorly attended, and realized only about \u00a32,000. January. \u2014 At a meeting of the town council of the borough of Gateshead, Mr. Price stated that a large number of lodging-houses in that town were filled by disreputable characters, driven from Newcastle by the vigilence of the police. Mr. Rowntree suggested that it would be better to say nothing about the matter, as it would serve as an invitation to such persons to seek lodgings there in greater numbers. Mr. Brockett replied that, having heard of as many as seventeen being found in one bed, it seemed as if the lodgings were already full.

At Scotswocd it burst into two rows of houses, fourteen in number, and speedily rose to a height of five feet. The Wear was also extremely high, but beyond the partial submersion of many houses on the banks of both streams, the damage done was comparatively trifling. January 1 2 \u2014 An alarming fire broke out this morning in the patent rope manufactory of R. Webster, esq., at Deptford, near Sunderland. The alarm was given by a young woman, and five engines were soon brought to the spot ; but in consequence of the dense smoke and the excessive heat, it was some time before they could be put into operation. As soon as it was practicable the engines were put to work ; but, notwithstanding every effort, the whole of the extensive manufactory, with its machinery, &c , was burnt to the ground. The loss was estimated at \u00a360,000, about two-thirds of which was insured. January 12. \u2014 The body of Mr. William Lawton, woollen manu facturer, Netherwitton, was found drowned on Morpeth High Stan ners, a little above the chain bridge. It was supposed the deceased had been washed from his horse, on which he was returning from Rothbury, the river being very high at the time.

The pre liminary arrangements having been made, Mr. Hodgson Hinde shortly addressed those present, informing them that he attended there that day as tbe deputy of Matthew Bell, Esq., MP., the chairman of the company, by whom it had been arranged that the foundation of that stupendous structure should have been laid, but who, he was sorry to say, was prevented by severe indisposition from attending. He then read the inscription on the brass plate to be deposited in the foundation. The inscription stated that the foundation-stone of that bridge was laid on the 13th of January, 1837, by Matthew Bell, esq., M.P., and enumerated the names of the chairman, vice-chairman and directors, of Mr. Green, the architect of the bridge, Mr. Nicholson, engineer to the railroad, Mr. John Straker, consulting engineer, and Mr. W. Swan, clerk. The plate, together with several coins of the present reign, was then placed between glass plates, and plaster being poured upon them, Mr. Hinde spread it around with a silver trowel. The stone was tnen placed on its bed, and the usual ceremonies being gone through, nine hearty cheers were then given and the proceedings terminated The bridges are of great extent and of peculiar construction, the arches being formed of laminated timber.

The wager was won by Storey, who hewed 33| tubs, 20 pecks each, and Surtees 30 tubs, the former being 10 tons 1 cwt, and the latter 9 tons. The amount of Storey's earnings would be 11s. 2d. and that of Surtees 10s. The time of working was eight hours, and from the extreme hardness of the seam the performance of each may be considered unprecedented.

At ten o'clock, on the signal being given, twenty-three competitors started for the honours ofthe day. Nothing could exceed the excellence of each man's performance to the eye of the general spectator, but to the more critical observation of the judges shades of individual perfection were noticed, and the prizes awarded accordingly. At the conclusion of the competition, the ploughmen were regaled with a substantial cold dinner, kindly provided by His Grace's orders. March 1. \u2014 That portion of the Newcastle and Carlisle railway, about 3^ miles in length, extending from Blaydon to Redheugh, was opened. The day was remarkably fine, and a great number of spectators were assembled to witness the ceremony. The banks of the river were also lined with people, to watch the progress of the train as it moved along, decorated with flags and streamers. After opening the railway, the directors proceeded to Hexham, and visited, on their return, the station and the bridge in course of erection at Bywell. On the arrival of the party at Newcastle, they proceeded to the Close, and partook of a cold collation, under the presidency of Matthew Plummer, esq., the chairman of the directors, and the day was finished with hilarity.

March 24. \u2014 As a hackney coach, belonging to Thomas Spires, was proceeding by Mosley Street to the Quayside, Newcastle, on arriving opposite the Newcastle Bank, the horses slipped and fell. Assistance being at hand, they were soon released from the har ness and got up. The streets being exceedingly slippery, the driver thought it unsafe to put the horses to the carriage again, and proposed to his passenger to send the auimals forward, while he and an assistant would guide the carriage down Dean Street. The gentleman, having remained in the coach all the time, and assenting to the coachman's proposal, away the carriage proceeded down Mosley Street, the driver leading by the pole of the coach, and the assistant holding on behind for the purpose of regulating the speed of the vehicle. On reaching the middle of Dean Street the coachman fell, and, luckily, the carriage passed over him within the wheels, and the assistant also having let go his hold, the car riage rushed down the remainder of the street with inconceivable velocity, to the dismay and astonishment of the spectators. At last it came in contact with the shop of Mr. Joshua Alder, cheese monger, with a tremendous crash, breaking the whole window frame and sixteen panes of glass. Mr. Alder, who was sitting in his office at the time, and who was wounded in the sac 3 by the broken glass, had a narrow escape, the coach pole coming through the window within half a foot of his head. Mr. Fairless was the gentleman inside the coach, but he received no injury. March 29. \u2014 A boy about three years of age, son of Mr. G. Taylor, Hartley Mill, was sent on an errand, and having to pass along the drawbridge over the cut at Seaton Sluice Harbour, in consequence of the darkness of the night he did not observe the bridge to be off, and walked over and fell not less than 45 feet. In his fall he came in contact with some part of a ship, by which he severely injured his right arm, and afterwards rebounded and fell into the water, in which he continued not less than twenty minutes before he could be extricated. April 3. \u2014 Died, at Byker Bar, near Newcastle, aged 71 years, \" Jackey\" Johnson, well known in . the neighbourhood as a pro fessor of the occult sciences. He was struck dumb a few days before he died, with the cards in his hands, while in the act of divination, and never spoke afterwards. Not being allowed by the authorities of the borough to exercise his mysterious calling within its precincts, he sought and found an asylum in the out skirts of the town, where his influence amongst a certain class was so astonishing, that in cases of theft, the mere visit of the owner to \" Jackey,\" in many instances, caused the restoration of the property.

The mill was insured, but Mr. Scott sustained a serious loss. April 14. \u2014 A poor widow, residing at Holywell Colliery, North umberland, bought a small fish of a hawker for a penny, and on opening it found half-a-sovereign in its stomach. April 18. \u2014 The rope of the shaft at Monkwearmouth Colliery, 264 fathoms in length, suddenly broke near the top, and fell upon five boys at the bottom, killing three of them upon the spot. The names of the sufferers were Robert Gray, aged 15 ; Francis Burrell, 12; and George Gilroy, 10 years. April 21. \u2014 Died, at the Vicarage-house, New Brentford, aged 66, the Rev. Sir Robert Peat, D.D. The deceased was a native of the county of Durham, and a knight of the Order of St. Stanislaus, having had this distinction conferred upon him by the last King of Poland, for eminent services rendered to that monarch by a near relative. The deceased knight was also prior of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem, aud chaplain to the Orange Lodge of England, and being an intimate friend of King George IV, the living of Brentford was conferred upon him through the solicitation of his majesty. Sir Robert married the well-known Miss Smith, a lady of exceedingly eccentric character, but from a remarkable dissimilarity of dispositions, they had not resided together for a long time. Sir Robert was highly distinguished for his accomplished manners and gentlemanly bearing, was an excel lent scholar, and a warm and devoted friend. April 22. \u2014 The five-quarter seam was sunk through at Crow trees colliery, laying opeu about 1,600 acres of the West Hetton coal-field, belonging to Messrs.

But his revered"], [81, "A.D. 1837.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 75 character is more highly elevated by his transcendant deeds of benevolence than any ancestral dignity could bestow. His remains were deposited in the family vault, in the northern aisle of Embleton church, on the 30th of May. The long line of the funeral procession, extending nearly a mile in length, produced an impressive effect as it approached the village of Embleton, where apparently the whole population of the neighbourhood had assembled to join in the last hallowed rites dedicated to the venerable and venerated friend and benefactor of humanity. 1837 (May 9). \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, iu his 73rd year, Sir David William Smith, bart., chief commissioner to the Duke of Northumberland for upwards of thirty years. His funeral took place at Alnwick on the 19th. The bells were tolled at intervals during the day, and the shops in the town were closed. The rank and character of the deceased drew together a great concourse of persons to honour the closing rites and witness the funeral procession, which surpassed in solemn grandeur any ever witnessed at Alnwick. May 11. \u2014 Shortly before midnight the attention of a person passing down the Royal Arcade, Newcastle, was directed to an. unusual light, a crackling noise, and a sulphurous smell issuing from the shop for fancy goods of M/. S. Gans, known as the Fancy Fair. It suddenly burst into a blaze, and in less than two hours the whole of its contents were reduced to ashes. Mr. Gans was insured to the full amount of his loss, and shortly after left the town. May 15. \u2014 Died, at Elemore Hall, Durham, in his 84th year, George Baker, esq. Mr. Baker was the only son and heir of George Baker, esq., of Elemore. He succeeded his father in 1774. In his earlier years he was supposed to be one of the best gentlemen riders in England. About two months before his decease Mr. Baker announced his intention to present a piece of plate to be run for at the next Newcastle races. This prize assumed the shape of a silver coal waggon, and was not run for until June 25th, 1838, when it was won by Mr. Orde's celebrated mare Beeswing. Mr. Baker was a candidate for the representation of the city of Durham in the year 1813, when a severe and expensive contest, of nine days duration, took place between himself and the late George Allan, of Blackwell Grange, esq. The latter was elected by a majority of 80. The deceased had been for some time in a declining state of health, but was sufficiently well to receive his rents from his tenantry on the very day he breathed his last. Having deposited his money in a place of safety, he signified his wish to retire to rest, and when his servant was in the act of undressing him he fell back in his chair and expired without a groan. Mr. Baker devised the bulk of his large property to his grandson \u2014 the eldest son of Colonel Towers, who married his only daughter \u2014 who is directed to assume the name of Baker upon his attaining the age of twenty-one.

Mr. Strachan, the skipper, with other two young men, succeeded at last in capturing the monster and killing it. The fish proved to be a conger eel, which weighed 3st. 41b., and measured 6 feet 3 inches in length 1837 (May 29).\u2014 The kiug's birthday, his 72nd, was celebrated in Newcastle by the usual demonstrations of loyalty and respect. June 21. \u2014 The intelligence of the death of his Majesty William the Fourth was received in Newcastle a little before seven a.m. The bells of the several churches commenced tolling, and continued to do so at intervals during Thursday. The flag on the castle, and those of the ships in the river, were hoisted half-mast high, and the shops were partially closed. At Sunderland, on Thursday, similar signs of grief were manifested for the demise of his majesty. June 23. \u2014 Queen Alexandria Victoria the First was pro claimed in Newcastle. Pursuant to a summons from the mayor, the council met in the Council Chamber at twelve o'clock, from whence they adjourned to the Merchants' Court for the purpose of drinking her Majesty's health. The clergy of the town and the officers of the Garrison and Northumberland Yeomaury having here joined the company, the mayor requested the party to fill a bumper of champagne, and drink the health of Queen Victoria, and a long, happy, and prosperous reign to her majesty, which was drunk with great enthusiasm. The company then proceeded to the Sandhill, where the town marshall read the proclamation of her majesty as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. ' Immediately after three times three cheers were given by the assemblage, the band at the same time playing the national air, the guns of the castle firing a royal salute, and the bells of the churches ringing, which together had a very imposing effect. Same day, Queen Victoria was proclaimed at Alnwick by the under-sheriff, accompanied by Charles W. Bigge, esq., chairman of the county, Robert Thorp, esq , clerk of the peace. J. Clutterbuck. esq., Edward Dale, esq., W. Laws, esq., the Rev. L. S. Orde, and other gentlemen. June 23. \u2014 At Sunderland, Durham, Hexham, aud South Shields, the same ceremonies were gone through, and all the corporations in this district presented loyal addresses to her majesty on her happy accession to the throne.

July 5. \u2014 The passing of the Warkworth Harbour Bill was cele brated at Warkworth on the evening of the above day, by illumi nations and rejoicings. The town presented an animated appear ance, beiug thronged to excess with people from the adjacent parts, all of whom seemed to participate in one joyous feeling. July 8. \u2014 The occasion ot the interment of the remains of his late majesty was observed in Newcastle and all the neighbouring towns with all the respect and attachment which were due to the exalted qualities of the deceased monarch. July. \u2014 After the short lapse of ten weeks, Jos. Smith, esq., and Co., owners of South Tanfield colliery reached the main coal seam, five feet eight inches in thickness. The sinking work was under the superintendence of Joseph Smith and Jos. Joicey, the two gen tlemen by whose skill South Hetton pit was sunk to the astonish ing depth of 180 fathoms, notwithstanding the difficulties and obstructions they had to encounter, in a time and at an expense unrivalled in this or any other mining district. July 12. \u2014 Great interest was manifested by a numerous class of Merchants in Newcastle and the neighbouring towns, on the occasion of the first public sale of teas at that port, consisting of from 3,000 to 4,000 chests, the property of Mr. Alexander George Gray. July 12 to 16. \u2014 The counties of Northumberland and Durham were visited with dreadful thunderstorms. These visitations were exceedingly capricious in violence and duration, but the most awful storms appear to have occurred in the district remote from Newcastle On the 14th, at Shawdon Woodhouse, near Glanton, Northumberland, Miss Donkin, niece of Mr. Carnaby, of that place, was struck dead by the electric fluid. It appears that Miss Donkin had gone into the kitchen, and unfortunately sat down below a bell ; when just at that moment the electric fluid entered the house, ran along the bell wire, and struck the young lady down with great violence, killing two dogs that lay near. On the same day, at Axwell Park, 970 panes of glass were destroyed. At Ryton, a cow was killed, and at Stella, six sheep shared the same fate. Mr. James Summers, of Brasside Moor, near Durham, had a stack of oats burnt to ashes from the effects of the lightning. At Newcastle, on the 16th, the storm was terrific in the extreme. The electric explosions which took place directly over the town were the loudest ever remembered, and had the vibrating effect of shaking every dwelling, vivid flashes of forked lightning pursued their capricious course through the air, careering amidst the storm of hail and rain, and lighting up the otherwise gloomy scene with a sublime but awful grandeur. Three houses in High Swinburne place, occupied by Mr. Beaumont, Mr. Mackreth, and the Misses"], [84, "78 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1837. Wright were entered, the bells torn down, the wires fused and destroyed by intense combustion. Mr. Mackreth's servant was thrown down but not hurt. At Alnwick, several buildings received partial damage. The lightning passed down the chimney of one house and set fire to a piece of paper in a boy's hand, and another child was thrown down, but they sustained no injury. 1837 (July 2i;.-- The James, of Perth, John McLaren master, lying at the Clarence Staiths, near Stockton, was discovered to be on fire.

The leading horse of the cart was also killed, the shaft horse not receiving the least injury. August 3. \u2014 Mr. Thomas Mather, farmer, Elyhaugh, was drowned while endeavouring to cross the Swarland Burn, near Felton, while it was much flooded. August 13. \u2014 A fire was discovered in Messrs. Fell & Co.'s pottery, at St. Peter's, near Newcastle. The damage was estimated at between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600. The property was insured in the North British Fire Offi-.e. August 30. \u2014 The St. John's chapel of ease, situated at Snod's Edge, in the parish of Shotley, was consecrated by the Bishop of Durham, who afterwards preached to a crowded congregation. Same day, a noble instance of self-devotion in the saving the life of a fellow creature was witnessed on the Quayside, New- castle.

At length the keelman rose to the surface bearing with him the boy in a state of insensi bility. He was taken home, however, and speedily recovered. The name of the bumaue and courageous man was William Sword. 1837 (August) \u2014 Early in this month, whilst some workmen were quarrying stone at Borcum Fell, near Bardon Mill, Northumberland, near to the Roman Station Vindolana, one of them found a copper vessel containing 63 coins, 3 of gold a/id the rest of silver. The gold coins were one of Claudius C\u00e6sar, reverse Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus, one of Nero, and one Vespasian. Of the silver coins 3 were of Galba, 1 of Otho, 1 of Nero, 15 of Vespasian, 8 of Domitian, 1 of Nerva, 17 of Trojan, 4 of Hadrian, aud 10 of various Empresses. The gold pieces were separately wrapped up in a greenish piece of leather or vellum, which was still quite tough, and many of the coins were as fresh as if just from the die. It was supposed that this treasure had been deposited about the year 120 \u2014 the date of Hadrian's memorable expedition to Britain. The vessel in which they were contained was in the form of a basket, about six inches long. The Duke of Northumberland, as lord of the manor, claimed the coins. A gold coin of the Emperor Nero, of great beauty and in excel lent preservation, was found about this time by a woman, while hoeing turnips in a field near Durham. September 4. \u2014 The foundation-stone of a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was laid in Blenheim-street, Newcastle, by William Nesham, esq. The chapel was opened October 26, 1838, and will accommodate 1,000 persons, including 300 sittings for the poor. September 5. \u2014 Died, at Bank Cottage, near Durham, in the 99th year of his age, Count Joseph Boruwlaski, the celebrated Polish dwarf, a native of the - province of Pokucia, in Polish Russia. This extraordinary person, though only thirty-six inches in height, was perfectly symmetrical in figure, and he enjoyed excellent health to a very late period in life. His lively genius and engaging manners caused him to be much noticed when he arrived in this couutry, aud having been seen by some of the prebendiaries of Durham, he was prevailed upon by that body to take up his abode in the above cottage, they engaging to allow him a handsome income, which he enjoyed up to his death. September 6. \u2014 The foundation-stone of the splendid Grey column in Grey-street, Newcastle, was laid by Messrs. John and Benjamin Green the architects. A glass bottle hermetrically sealed, containing a drawing of the building, surmounted with a statue of the noble earl, a list of subscribers to the undertaking, a collection of silver and copper coins of the Brunswick dynasty, with several local medals and tradesmen's tokens contributed by Mr. John Fenwick, and a parchment scroll, was deposited in a chamber cut in the stone, and encased in plaster of Paris.

On the Ilth of August, 1838, the column had reached its eleva tion, and on the ?4th of the same month, the statue of Earl Grey was placed upon its summit. The bells of the churches immediately afterwards commenced a merry peal, and continued at intervals during the remaining portion of the day. In the first week of November the scaffolding was removed, and the column exposed to the full gaze of the public. As a work of art, the figure is a noble effort of genius, and reflects the highest credit on its accomplished author, Mr. Bailey, whilst the resemblance it bears to the venerable nobleman to whom it is intended to do honour, is all that his most ardent admirers could wish. The height of the column to the top of the figure is 133 feet, and the diameter of the shaft at the base, is 9 feet 11 inches. The architecture is Roman doric, and there is a staircase consisting of 164 steps to the summit of the capital, from which there is a fine panoramic view of the town and the surrounding country. The figure was brought from London by the Newcastle trader \" Halcyon,\" belonging to Edmund Graham, esq., Mr. James Purvis, master.

The rivers, in consequence, were greatly flooded, particularly the Wear and the Brownie. At Sunderland Bridge, three miles south of Durham, the road was completely overflown, and all passage stopped for a considerable time. The mail got through with great difficulty, the horses being nearly carried away. The Wellington and Hero coaches were detained several hours, and the inside passengers were obliged to mount the outside for safety, the water reaching high in the inside. In Sunderland Harbour, the loss sustained by boats, keels, and timber drifting out to sea, was estimated at upwards of \u00a33,000. December 20. \u2014 A boy named Edward Mennim, aged six and a half years, residing at Biddlestone Edge, in the parish of Alwinton, Northumberland, was sent on an errand to Biddlestone, a short distance from his home. Soon after his departure a dense fog came on, and the boy not returning at the time expected, his father and others went in search of him, which they continued nntil night without discovering the child. The distracted state of the parents, and the probable disastrous fate of the boy, called forth the sympathy of the inhabitants of the district. The shepherds on the upland sheep farms, in the most praiseworthy manner, traversed the country in all directions and kept up a continued search for nearly twenty days, when on the 8th of January, 1838, they found the body of the poor little fellow among the moorland hills, at a place called Hockley Dean Law, in the parish of Alnham, the child having traversed a wild mountainous country (the southern range of the Cheviot Hills) in a north easterly direction from his home. He was found lying upon his back with his arms firmly thrust into the pockets of his trousers, his eyes were partially open, and his face retained the freshness and bloom of life and health, indicating that he had, from the effect of cold and exhaustion slept into death. Thomas Clennell, esq-, of Harbottle Castle, whose feelings are at all times alive to distress, took an active part in the case of tbe lost child, as also the Rev. A. Proctor, vicar of Alwinton, the hon. Mr. Stourton, of Biddlestone Hall, and the Messrs. Grey.

The water having been analysed by an eminent chemist was found to be strongly impregnated with the sulphates of soda, magnesia, and lime, as well as with carbonic acid and oxide of iron. Mr. Richardson having erected an elegant bath house, and laid out the surrounding grounds with considerable taste, the place was for some time afterwards much frequented by invalids.

To save the life of the woman was an object of intense anxiety, and this could only be done by the performance of ihe Ceasarian operation. Mr. Ward, accompanied by some pro fessional friends, undertook the painful responsibility, aud after a quick and dextrous operation, produced a female child, which had been dead for some days, but the life of the mother was fortunately preserved. 1837 (October 19;. \u2014 At Manor Wallsend Colliery, near South Shields, a melancholy catastrophe occurred. An old man named Conway, and a young man named Thomson, had some words, during which altercation the latter, in a moment of ungovernable irritation, took up a pick and struck it into Conway's body, with such fatal force and effect that he died upon the spot. October 31. \u2014 One of those disgraceful exhibitions which occasion- ally occur in this kingdom \u2014 a prize fight \u2014 took place at Middleton Bridge, near Cambois, Northumberland. The combatants were a black, who called himself Young Molyneux, and a man of the name of Renwick, who resided at Winlaton, near Newcastle. The black, who was visiting Newcastle on a \"sparring tour,\" was challenged by his opponent to fight for \u00a325 a-side. Owing to the interference of Thomas Anderson, esq., of Kirkharle, the fight did not commence until five o'clock, The contest continued for an hour and a half, and an idea may be formed of its severity from the fact that 87 rounds were fought with half a minute rest between each round. The black \u2014 darkness having come on \u2014 in the latter part of the fight butted his antagonist with his head. He won the battle, and the Winlaton man was left on the field nearly dead ; being dread- fully punished. November 1. \u2014 The new Monkwearmouth wet dock, on the north side of the Wear, was opened in due form, amid the firing of guns, ringing of bells, fireworks, &c. During the afternoon, the brig Iona, splendidly decorated, having a band of music and a large party of ladies and gentlemen on board, sailed down the river and entered the dock in gallant style, amid the loud huzzas of thousands of spectators. Two other new vessels also entered the dock. One was built by Mr. Johnson, of Hylton, the other by Mr. Laing, of Deptford. The dock and basin are nearly eight acres in extent, and were formed to accommodate about one hundred vessels. A ball took place in the evening at the New Inn. November 5. \u2014 A man named John Atkinson, who had been in the employment of Mr. Sorsbie, corn merchant, in a fit of insanity threw himself out of a window at the foot of the Butcher Bank, Newcastle, from the height of more than fifty feet. The unhappy man, who was about sixty years of age, died within six hours after wards. November 8. \u2014 A fire broke out in the lower workshops of Mr. R. Small, turner, Groat Market, Newcastle, by which Mr."], [91, "A.D. 1837.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 85 Small and an apprentice, named John Amory, were both severely burnt. Assistance being at hand, Mr. Small and the boy were both rescued. It appeared that the cause of the fire originated with the master and the boy, who were engaged in pouring spirits of wine from one bottle to another. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected mayors, and sheriffs:\u2014 Newcastle\u2014 Thomas Emmerson Headlam, esq., M.D., mayor; John Carr, esq, sheriff.

Hedley, esq., mayor ; Berwick \u2014 George Johnston, esq., mayor ; and John Clay, esq., sheriff. November 20. \u2014 A very melancholy accident occurred at the works of Mr. John Renoldson, engineer, South Shields. A number of ladies and gentlemen had assembled to witness the trial of a new locomotive engine, when a defect occurred in the safety valve, which caused the boiling water to rush out with considerable force. The youngest daughter of Mr. Renoldson, about fifteen years of age, and a youth named Messenger, were so much scalded as to cause their death shortly after, and one or two others were seriously injured. November 24. \u2014 Died, at Scone Palace, Perthshire, aster a few hours illness, Louisa, Viscountess Stormont, third daughter of Cuthbert Ellison, esq., of Hebburn Hall, near Newcastle. December 6. \u2014 A melancholy catastrophe occurred at Springwell Colliery, near Wreckenton, four miles from Newcastle, from an explosion of four air. The cause of the accident was not discovered, as out of the fifteen men and ten boys not one was saved. A similar accident occurred in 1833, by which forty-seven human beings were deprived of life. December 9. \u2014 A boy about five years of age, named Kirkup, slipped unperceived into Mr. Gallon's paper manufactory at the Felling Shore, near Gateshead, and climbed upon one of the wheels. The weight of the boy, it is supposed, set the machinery in motion, and he unfortunately had both his legs wrenched off. December 14. \u2014 Considerable alarm was occasioned on the Quayside, Newcastle, in consequence of a loud report being heard and flames seen issuing from the office windows of Mr. Robert Proctor, broker. It appeared that a young man in the service of Mr. Proctor had been imprudently handing a flask containing gunpowder, when, by some means it exploded, blowing out the two front windows, and severely scorching the young man. The flames were promptly extinguished. December 18. \u2014 The first marriage in a dissenting place of worship, in Newcastle, was celebrated in New Court Chapel, Westgate, by the Rev. George Sample. The parties were Mr. William Detchon and Miss Barbara Hurst, 1837 (December20). \u2014 This was the gloomiest day ever remembered in Newcastle, the rain falling incessantly, and in the evening the wind blew very strong from the north-east, from which the"], [92, "1837.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 83 86 1837 (Sept. li;.\u2014 The Free and Accepted Masons of Northum berland held a Grand Provincial Lodge at the Turk's Head Inn, Grey Street,- Newcastle, for the purpose of installing the Earl of Durham as Provincial Grand Master of the Lodge. After the election and the usual ceremonies, 110 of the brethren sat down to a sumptuous dinner, at which his lordship presided. September 13. \u2014 The foundation-stone of the bridge over the river Font, at Netherwitton, was laid by R. Trevelyan, esq., in the presence of a large assemblage of spectators. The bridge was built by subscription, aud is a handsome structure of two segmental arches of 23 feet span each. September 20. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, after a few days' illness, aged 78, Mr. John Rawling Wilson, for many years landing sur veyor in the Customs at Newcastle, and a well known local anti quary. Mr. Wilson was a gentleman of considerable literary and antiquarian research, and from his long residence and extensive knowledge of the town and neighbourhood, he was generally referred to in matters connected with its history and inhabitants. September 21. \u2014 Thomas Holburn, 91 years of age, an inmate of Bedlington workhouse, and who had been completely blind for 12 years, had his sight suddenly restored to him whilst at dinner. He at once resumed his round in the village, recognising his old acquaintances and haunts. October 1. \u2014 Died near Morpeth, aged 100, Mr. Robert Besford. October 4. \u2014 At a meeting of the town council of Newcastle, the question of building a corn market was discussed. A company had been formed some years before for the purpose of erecting a market on the site of the Middle Street, and in July, 1834, the corporation resolved to pay the company \u00a39,000 on the completion of the building. Some delay having taken place, Mr Grainger made an offer of a new and elegant structure as a free gift to the town, aud it was contended that the resolution of 1834 \u2014 having never been perfected, was not binding upon the reformed corpo ration. The matter caused a considerable amount of excitement, models of the rival markets being exhibited, and memorials on behalf of both were very numerously signed. The discussion this day was, on a motion of Mr. Charnley, to confirm the minute of 1834. This resolution was ultimately carried by 32 votes against 17. Mr. Grainger's building is now the Central Exchange News Rooms. October 12. \u2014 The elegant new church at Earsdon, near North Shields, was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of Durham. The length of the church is about 79 feet, by 30 feet broad, is dedicated to St. Albans, and is of the early English character, from plans by Messrs. John and Benjamin Green, of Newcastle. The church being erected on an eminence, its tower has an imposing appearance for a considerable distance, both by sea and land. The cost was estimated to exceed \u00a32,000.

January 6. \u2014 Frost of an extreme intensity prevailed throughout the northern counties, and the first snow of the winter fell this day, the wind blowing keen from the north-east, the storm continued with great severity till the end of the month. All passage on the river Tyne was stopped, it being frozen for upwards of five miles below Newcastle, and crowds of skaters appeared upon it. In no year since the celebrated frost of 1814 had one occurred like the present. In proof of this it may be mentioned that loaded carts crossed the Tyne, the Coquet, the Tweed, and other rivers in the north, upon the ice at various points. January 10. \u2014 W. D. Anderson, Esq., was appointed resident engineer to the corporation of Newcastle. There were twenty-one applicants for the office. January 13. \u2014 Died, at his house in Hamilton Place, London, in his 87th year, John Scott, Earl of Eldon, high Steward of the university of Oxford, a governor of the Charter House, and a member of the Privy Council, D.C.L., F.R.S., and F.S.A. The deceased was the youngest son of William Scott, a respectable coal fitter and merchant in Newcastle, and was born in his father's residence in Love Lane, on the 4th of June, 1751, the anniversary of the birth of George the Third. John, like his brother William, was educated at the grammar school at Newcastle, but at an early age he quitted it for the university of Oxford. In 1767 he was elected a fellow of University College, and in 1771 he gained the chancellor's prize for an English Essay \" On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Foreign Travel.\" Shortly after this he married. His wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Aubone Surtees, esq., a banker at Newcastle. The match was a runaway one, and the lady was carried off from one of the upper windows of her father's house, on the Sandhill, Newcastle, yet unlike most matches impru dently formed it was productive of the greatest connubial happiness during a period of many years. Lady Eldon was extremely beautiful, but the qualities of the heart surpassed even her personal attractions. She would sit up with her husband, cheering his midnight studies as a lawyer, watching him with silent affection, and moving about on tiptoe that she might not disturb the connection of his thoughts. She died in 1831. In 1773 Scott was admitted a student of the Middle Temple, and never, perhaps, did student burn the midnight lamp with greater ardour or perseverance, In the diligence of his studies he must have equalled Sir Matthew Hale ; like him, ultimately success was his reward. In 1776 he was calied to the bar, but for some time his success was so indifferent that he made up his mind to reside in Newcastle, and practise as a provincial barrister, but a certain"], [94, "88 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D, 1838. circumstances induced him to abandon his intention. In 1777 tho notorious Stoney Bowes became a candidate for Newcastle, and Mr. Scott was employed in the proceedings which Mr. Bowes instituted for unseating his successful rival, Sir John Trevelyan. This was one of Mr. Scott's first retainers, and it was not his last from the same person, for Mr. Bowes was returned for Newcastle in 1780, and again engaged Mr. Scott to defend his seat, which was attacked by Mr. Delaval. In 1781 Mr. Scott was offered the Recordership of Newcastle, but declined the offer. In less than two years he was invested with the silk gown, and was elected M.P. for Weobly, and though his powers as a debater were never effective, he soon obtained the notice and patronage of Mr. Pitt. In 1799 he was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Eldon, of Eldon, Durham, and appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1801, in the formation of the Addington ministry, he was made Lord High Chancellor. This important office he held until 1806, when Erskine succeeded him under the administration of \" All the Talents.\" On the lst of April, 1807, he was re-appointed, and from this time he continued in office until April 30, 1827, altogether a period of nearly twenty five years. The abilities displayed by Lord Eldon in this eminent position it would be difficult adequately to describe. His judgments, which occupy thirty volumes, are valuable, principally to lawyers ; but in learning, accuracy, and research, it may be truly said he has never been surpassed, if he has ever been equalled. His decisions stand as bulwarks of the law, and the greatest lawyers subsequent to him have expressed their admiration of them. Like his elder brother, (Lord Stowell) though addicted to the pleasures of the table, he was parsimonious to a degree, and, as might be expected, he left an enormous fortune, far exceeding even that of Lord Stowell. The personal property alone was sworn under \u00a3700,000, and this was exclusive of very large landed estates. Lord Eldon, by his countess, had two sons and two daughters \u2014 first, the honourable John Scott, who married Henrietta Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart., and died in 1805, leaving one son, who succeeded his grandfather in the earldom. Second, Lady Elizabeth, married in 1817 to George S. Repton, esq., architect, by whom she had one son. Third, the honourable William Henry John Scott, barrister at law, who died in 1802, aged 38. Fourth, Lady F. Jane, married in 1820 to the Rev. Edward Bankes, rector of Corse Castle, who survived her father but a few months. The present earl of Eldon married in 1 831 the hon. Louisa Duncombe, youngest sister of the present, and daughter of the late Lord Feversham. January 16. \u2014 The Queen appointed the right hon. John George earl of Durham to be governor general of the British American provinces.

It seems his apprentice was alone in the shop, and had by some accident set fire to a 51b. cannister of gunpowder. The boy was very much burnt. 1838 (Feb. ll;. \u2014 Died, at his residence in Sunniside, Bishop wearmouth, the Rev. Robert Gray, A.M., rector of Sunderland, aged 48. He was nephew to the late Dr. Gray, Bishop of Bristol, and had held the rectory of Sunderland for 18 years. As a mini ster of the gospel he was talented aud attractive, which qualities were only exceeded by his practical piety and ardent zeal for the general inculcation of Christian knowledge. As a philanthropist he was unbounded in the promotion and support of public charities, and in private visitations and relief to the poor of all ages and sects. His last illness was produced by cold, and terminated in fever. His death was much lamented, and his memory will be long cherished in grateful remembrance by all who knew him. His remains were committed to the tomb on the 20th, amidst thousands of mourning spectators, the shops in the town were closed, and business was entirely suspended. February 20. \u2014 An explosion took place at Whitley colliery, near Tynemouth, by which four individuals were dreadfully burnt, two of whom died the same day. February 23. \u2014 A fire broke out in the stackyard of Mr. A. Youag, Newton-by-the-Sea. The progress of the flames was so rapid as to destroy in a short time the whole stackyard, containing 22 stacks of corn. February 24. \u2014 The whole extent of the east coast of Durham and Northumberland was visited by a heavy fall of snow, with the accompaniment of a strong easterly wind, which caused the snow to drift in many places from ten to twelve feet deep. The Edinburgh mail was completely embedded about seven miles north of Alnwick, and had to be abandoned by the passengers, who made their way through the fields to North Charlton, and were detained there four days. The Otterburn and Wooler roads were closed for more than a week. Very great damage was also sustained by the shipping on the coast during the storm. The Benwell, trader between Newcastle and London, was lost, with a valuable cargo ; and upwards of twenty vessels were driven on shore between Hartlepool and Berwick, many of the crews being drowned. February. \u2014 This month a splendid diamond ring was presented by the Emperor of Russia to John Thomas Carr, Esq., his imperial majesty's vice-consul at the port of Newcastle. February. \u2014 This month the owners of Radcliffe colliery, near Warkworth, succeeded in boring to a seam of coal, between four and five feet in thickness, of excellent quality, about fifty-seven fathoms from the surface. March 21. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning in the north end of the castle at Durham. An alarm was immediately given, when it was ascertained that the fire was confined to the apartments of Mr. Alexander Watson, B.A., who had property consumed to the vol. III.

The fire was accidental. 1838 (March 28;.\u2014 Died, aged 74, Thomas Morton, Esq., one of the most successful of modern dramatists. He was born in Durham, in 1764, aud is the author of \" Town and Country,\" \" Columbus,\" \" The Children in the Wood,'' \" Zorinski,\" \" The Way to Get Married,\" \" A Cure for the Heart-Ache,\" \" Speed the Plough,\" \" The School of Reform,\" \" A Roland for an Oliver,\" and several other pieces of high reputation. Mr. Morton left three sons, one of whom is the author of several pieces, and another an artist of considerable merit. March 31. \u2014 A boatman, named John Gordon, of the Duke of Wellington steamer, fell overboard at Newcastle Quay, when iu the act of mcoring that vessel, and was drowned. The same boat, on her passage from Shields, not half-an-hour before, picked up the body of a man who had been drowned out of a wherry the same morning. Gordon, who left a wife and six children, aided in carry ing the body of the wherryman to the dead-house, when he made a remark ou the uncertainty of life. March. \u2014 The fishermen of Berwick not having been to sea in the beginning of this month, the fish, singular as the fact may seem, actually came on shore to them, glad to to take shelter, it is sup posed, from the fury of the storm. The shore, under and north of the Magdalen field, was literally covered with cod-fish and had docks, most of which were taken alive. April 1. \u2014 On the morning of this day, Sub-inspector Smellie, of the police, discovered a fire above the Hare and Hound public house, Colvin's Chare, Quayside, Newcastle. On hastening upstairs he perceived that a bedstead and the flooring of the room were on fire, and two children lying asleep on the bed. With the assist ance of police-constable Best, he got the children safe out of the house, and afterwards succeeded iu extinguishing the fire. April 14. \u2014 Died, in Newgate-street, Newcastle, aged 62, Mr. Robert Nichol, much and deservedly respected. Mr. Nichol was the author of several compositions in prose and verse, some of which were printed in the \" Newcastle Magazine.\" April 24. \u2014 Died, at Shillhottle Wood House, near Warkworth, Sarah, aged 89, and on the 25th, her husband, George Orde, aged 88. The remains of this venerable couple were interred in the same grave, in Shillbottle churchyard. May 5.\u2014 Died, at his residence in Ridley-place, Newcastle, aged 69, Nathaniel Winch, Esq. Mr. Winch was well known iu the scientific world as an excellent British botanist. He was the author of \" An Essay ou the Geographical Distribution of Plants through the Counties of Northumberland and Durham,\" and of a very elaborate \" Flora of Northumberland and Durham. He bequeathed the whole of his extensive Herbarium and his library of natural history to the Linnean Society, of which he was a member, and left a legacy of \u00a3200 to the Newcastle infirmary, to which institution he acted as secretary for a period of twenty-one years."], [97, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 91 1838(MaylO). \u2014 Anewwinning was commenced upon the Seaton Delaval estate by Joseph Lamb, esq., and company, which forms a new feature in the sinking of collieries. Grouud was broken for six pits, exclusive of two engine shafts, all within the compass of 600 yards. About the same date, E. R. G. Braddyll, esq., and partners broke ground at Morton, near Hetton, for two double shafts, or four pits within forty yards of each other. May 18. \u2014 A fire broke out in a house in the Back Row, Stockton, which by prompt exertion was soon extinguished, but a young man named Robert Eden lost his life by suffocation before an entrance was effected. May 22. \u2014 One of those disgusting and demoralising scenes, a prize fight, took place on Hedley Common, near the village of Ryton, in the county of Durham, between Robert Forbister, an engine wright, and John Brown, a white smith, both of Newcastle. They fought for \u00a320, and their encounter ended in the death of Brown. Forbister was convicted at the Durham Assizes of the manslaughter, and was sentenced by Mr. Baron Alderson to four months' hard labour. Considerable excitement was caused in Newcastle by the Rev. W. Dodd, incumbent of St. Andrew's, refusing to allow Brown's body to be interred iu the churchyard. May 30. \u2014 Died, at his residence in Sunderland, Solomon Chapman, esq., aged 88 years. This worthy and exemplary individual, was a member of the Society of Friends, and a true and faithful representation of what the ancient gentlemen of that class of christians were wont to be, and though firm and undeviating in his adherence to the usages of his sect, yet were his kindness and hospitality extended to all whom he esteemed without reference to their creed. June. \u2014 Early in this month, as the Brunswick, of Sunderland, was on her passage from London to that port, the crew discovered that a youth, who was serving on board as an apprentice, was a female. The circumstance was made known to the captain, Mr. Hossack, who took her into the cabin and gave her up the use of his state room to render her situation as comfortable as possible. June 3 \u2014 Died, in the Bethlehem Hospital for lunatics, Jonathan Martin, the man who set fire to York Minster some years before, for which he was tried and acquitted on the ground of insanity. He was brother of the eccentric William Martin, of Newcastle, \" The Philosophical Conqueror of all Nations,\" and of John Martin, the celebrated painter. When he was first admitted into the hospital, he was allowed the use of paper and pencil, but the governors finding that he invariably occupied his time in drawing sketches of York Minster, and that his doing so threw him into a state of great excitement, they prohibited his being supplied with those articles in future. His son Richard committed suicide in the following August. June 16. \u2014 Mr. John Dickenson, of Eals, in the parish of Knaresdale, Northumberland, an eccentric character, the father of eight children, collected together thirty-two of his friends, to"], [98, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1838. 92 become sponsors for them. The party set out for the parish church, Dickenson, the father, playing several of his favourite airs on the violin, at the head of the merry group. They were met at church by the Rev. Thomas Bewsher, the rector, who, after putting the necessary questions, christened the eight children, the rev. gentleman observing, that, in all his ministry, he never before had had such a presentation. 1838( June 18/\u2014 The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway wasopened throughout its whole extent, from Redheugh, a little to the west of Gateshead, to the city of Carlisle. The vast number of ladies and gentlemen who had assembled for the purpose of travelling to the other end of the line, the countless spectators, and the numerous bands of music, made up a scene of great animation and gaiety. At half-past twelve o'clock the signal was given for the engines to start, when the Rapid was despatched as an advanced guard, without any train, aud was followed by thirteen other engines, drawing 120 well-filled carriages. The aggregate number of passengers in all the trains was estimated at nearly 4,000, and the trains, when close together, above half a mile in length. The gay procession was received with great enthusiasm along the route, particularly at Corbridge, Hexham, and Haydon Bridge, and the whole party reached Carlisle between five and six o'clock. The shades of night had set in before the trains commenced their homeward journey, and the first did not arrive at Redheugh until between two aud three o'clock in the morning, and many of them at a much later hour. June 20. \u2014 Died, at Axwell Park, in the 77th year of his age, Charles John Clavering, esq., senior magistrate of the county of Northumberland. He held the office of high sheriff of Durham from 1829 to 1833, and of which county he was a zealous and upright magistrate. June 22. \u2014 At a meeting held in the Guildhall, Newcastle, T. E. Headlam, esq., mayor, in the chair, to take into considera- tion what should be done in order properly to celebrate the coronation of the queen on the 28th of the same month. It was decided that instead of an illumination a subscription should be raised and applied to the erection of a building to be entitled \" The Royal Viotoria Asylum for the Blind and Deaf and Dumb.\" The subscriptions soon after amounted to \u00a31,000. June 27.\u2014 Mr. James Wilkie, house surgeon to the Newcastle dispensary, in a fit of temporary insanity, threw himself from the window in Miss Bell's boarding-house, Grey-street, in that town, and died shortly afterwards. The deceased was so highly respected that upwards of 1,000 persons followed his body to the grave June 28. \u2014 This being the day appointed for the coronation of her majesty, a general holiday was observed throughout the kingdom, and nowhere were the loyal feelings of the people more emphatically displayed than in Northumberland and Durham. In Newcastle, the churches and every public edifice were ornamented"], [99, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 93 with flags, among which St. Nicholas' church was especially dis tinguished, the steeple being decorated with flags, even to the very top. At one o'clock a royal salute was fired from the castle, and the yeomanry fired three volleys after which the mayor called upon all arouud him to join iu drinking the health of Queen Victoria with all the honours, the troops at the same time presenting arms, the band playing the national anthem, and the immense crowd of spectators joining in loud and continued huzzas. The poor in the several workhouses were regaled with good dinners, and meat, bread, &c , were distributed among the out poor in the parishes of St. Nicholas, St. Andrew, and All Saints', the inmates of the cor poration hospitals had each 5s. presented to them, and the prison ers in the gaol were treated with a good dinner at the expense of the corporation. At Gateshead, Sunderland, North and South Shields, Hexham, Durham, Stockton, Darlington, Morpeth, Blyth, Alnwick, and indeed every towu and village in the district the attention to the poor was most considerate, and unalloyed happi ness everywhere prevailed. 1838 (Jidy 3). \u2014 Married, at Alnwick, Edward John Clavering, Esq., of Callaly Castle, to Jane, only daughter of John Carr, esq., of Bondgate Hall and Broxfield. Callaly Castle, the residence of the ancient family of the Claverings, is situated about two miles west of Whittinghain. Near to it, at a place called Callaly Hill, are to be seen the remains of a large fortified camp, supposed to be of Roman origin. Callaly was the villa of William de Callaly in the beginning of the reign of Henry III., and of his son Gilbert de Callaly, in the same reign, who granted it, with the manor of Yet lington, to Roger Fitz-Roger, Baron of Warkworth and Clavering, which grant was confirmed by the crown 55 Henry III. This family of the Claveriugs derive their descent, in the male line, from Charlemagne. The old family name of the Claverings waa De Burgb. Eustace de Burgh, a noble Norman, had two sons, who came over with William the Conqueror, three of whose descendants were amongst the iwenty-five principal English barons who headed and led on almost all the nobility of this kingdom to obtain the celebrated Magna Charta from King John ; and their signatures to this important bulwark of British liberty attest the zeal and patriotism of the north-country families. Eva, one of the descend- ants ofthe Claverings, during the reign of Edward III., was mar- ried four times, and during six generations produced the following illustrious personages : \u2014 A King and Queen of England, a Duchess of York, a Duchess of Clarence, a Duke of Bedford, a Marquis of Montacute, Earls of Westmoreland, Northumberland, Salisbury, and Kent, the celebrated Earl of Warwick, a Lord Abergaveny, an Archbishop of York, and an Earl Marshal of England.

July 11.\u2014 The fouudation-stone of a Jewish Synagogue was laid iu Temple-street, Westgate, Newcastle, by Mr. Harris, on which occasion the Rabbi, S. Hoffnung, delivered a sermon in the Hebrew language. The building is of stone with a polished ashlar front, and was opened for service on the 19th of September in the same year, 5,599, being New Year's Day, according to the Jewish calender. July 16. \u2014 The Supervisor of the Morpeth district and the officers of the Loug Framliagton preventive station, iu their route across the Tossen hills, discovered an illicit distillery, in full operation, very artfully contrived on the side of a great peat moss called Codley Moss. The officers only discovered one man (an Irishman) in the place, who was committed to Morpeth Gaol for three months in default of the penalty of thirty pounds. July 18. \u2014 A swarm of bees lighted on a man and a boy, standing near the Pack Horse Inn, in Morpeth, during the market, their faces being completely covered. A hive having been pro cured aud the queen bee placed in it, her subjects were gradually attracted from their curious resting place, and thus the parties escaped unhurt, much to the satisfaction of crowds who were anxiously awaiting the result.

August 20. \u2014 The eighth annual meeting of the British Associ ation for the advancement of Science was held in Newcastle during the seven days extc nding from the twentieth to the twenty sixth. For some months previous great and important preparations had been in progress in order to do honour to the distinguished body who had accepted the invitation previously given, and nothing was omitted which could in any way effect this desirable end. The large influx of strangers which was expected led the local com mittee to make some enquiry respecting lodging houses for their accommodation ; but this resource being found inadequate, many gentlemen, including the mayor and other distinguished and respectable individuals, offered the use of beds, some of two and others of three, four, and even five. The applications for tickets of membership by residents in the district far exceeded the estimate originally formed, and they at last became so numerous that it was necessary to withhold any further issue, except the parties requiring tickets would become life members, or consented to receive gratuitously at least one stranger into their houses. The Duke of Northumberland, president of the Association, arrived in Newcastle with his duchess on the 18th, and took up his residence with R. Leadbitter, esq., in Westmoreland House, Westgate-street,"], [101, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 95 and his grace's arrival heralded that influx of distinguished visitors from all parts of Europe which continued up to the time of opening the proceedings. The various sectional meetings assembled each day at eleven in the forenoon, in the large rooms of the public institutions of the town, which had been fitted up expressly for the occasion. On the eveniug of the 22nd the Green Market was opened for promenade conversation and refreshment, and presented a most brilliant spectacle. On the 26th the concluding general meeting of the Association took place, ending a week of important scientific business, unparalleled of its kind. 1,391 tickets had been issued to resident members, and 895 to strangers, being an aggregate increase of 446 over the members at Liverpool in the previous year. The total receipts were \u00a32,410 15s. The Marquis of Northampton moved a vote of thanks to the mayor and corpora tion of Newcastle for the very hospitable reception the Association had met with in the town and neighbourhood, and after several other complimentary votes, the chairman announced the termination of the meeting. 1838 (August 24;. \u2014 The Durham Junction Railway was opened The railway procession, which set off from South Shields, consisted of two trains, capable of accommodating 400 persons, amongst which were many distinguished members of the British Association. The sun shone brilliantly, the South Shields band played the national air, cannons roared, flags waved iu the breeze, thousand of voices sent forth a shout of joy, while the engines dragged off their respective trains to the magnificent Victoria Bridge, built at a cost of about \u00a335,000, after designs and under the superintendence of T. Elliott Henderson, esq., the celebrated eagineer. The bridge has four main arches, respectively of 160, 14A, and 100 feet span, having three smaller ones on each side, the length of the bridge being 270 yards, and its height from the bed ot the river 157 feet. The bridge was designed from Tragans bridge at Alcantara, and occupied 7i6 working days in building. To view this sublime object the company descended to the valley, where the eye could take in the whole at one view. Indeed, a scene better calculated to give an elevated opinion of the triumph of geuius over nature can scarcely be conceived. The company again took their seats and proceeded about six miles further on the railway, when 100 waggons of coals from Black Boy pit t^the property of the marquis of Londonderry) were attached to a locomotive, and the whole procession then returned to Shields. All was pleasurable excitement until the Victoria Bridge was reached, when the engine of the second train ran into the carriages attached to the first, and some serious injuries were sustained by the passengers. At South Shields, a splendid cold collation was provided, Robert Ingham, esq., in the chair, after which success to the undertaking was drunk with much enthusiasm. August 24. \u2014 Mr. Brown, the aercnant, of Sheffield, made an ascent from the enclosure in Green-court, Newcastle, in his splendid balloon \" The North Star.\" The gas was supplied from"], [102, "96 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1838 Clayton-street and Newgate-street. The process of inflation was completed soon after three o'clock, and the cords loosened which restrained its aerial flight. The balloon cleared the houses beauti fully on rising, and then proceeded in a south-easterly direction, in full view of thousands of spectators, who watched its progress with intense interest. 1838 (Auyust 26/ \u2014 As an appropriate sequel to the gaiety and splendour of the previous week, a magnificent entertainment was given at Ravensworth Castle, by Lord and Lady Ravensworth, to upwards of five hundred distinguished individuals, including all the nobility and gentry of the district, the learned foreigners, and other eminent members of the British Association. The prepara tions were on a most extensive and splendid scale,- three spacious and elegant apartments having been fitted up expressly for the occasion, in which was exhibited every delicacy of the season, on massive and beautiful plate, in princely profusion. August 28. \u2014 The master and brethren of the Trinity-house, Newcastle, presented the freedom of that corporation, in silver boxes, to Captains Sir George Back and J. C. Ross, R.N., for their humane attention to the crews of the whaling ships frozen in the ice during the inclement season of 1837. September 1. \u2014 An accident occurred at the Howdon Pans colliery, by the bursting in of a large quantity of water, by which three men and four horses lost their lives. September 2. \u2014 The boiler of the steam-tug Vivid, belonging to a family named Greener, of North Shields, exploded in the Tyne, at that place, by which two young men, sons of the owner, were dreadfully scalded, and died shortly after in great agony. September 2. \u2014 Thomas Robson, jun., of Newbottle, whilst bath ing near the village of Ryhope, got into a quicksand. His brother and a companion, who witnessed the distressing scene, having in vain attempted to rescue him, applied to the inhabitants of the village for assistance, which, however, did not arrive before life was extinct. September 4. \u2014 The first exhibition of the Sunderland Polytechnic Society was opened, and was visited during that and subsequent days by most of the leading families of the district. The exhibition embraced numerous works by modem artists, architects, and mechanics, of paintings in every branch of the art, models of monuments, bridges, churches, &c. ; and also of many excellent mechanical inventions. There were also in the exhibition numerous specimens of stuffed animals, birds, shells, minerals, &c, of the most interesting description to the naturalist. In short, the exhibition of the Sunderland Polytechnic Society differed from every other, inasmuch as it was an epitome of the best and most captivating of everything that could be brought together. September 4. \u2014 Thomas Cowley, a pipemaker, of Gateshead, undertook, for a trifling wager, to leap from Newcastle bridge into the Tyne and was drowned. A more successful act of folly of the same kind was perpetrated in September, 1850."], [103, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 97 1838 (September 4). \u2014 It having been determined to erect the Corn Market on the ground occupied by the Middle Street, New castle, about July this year, the old houses were removed, and on the above day the foundation-stone was laid by the mayor, T. E. Headlam, esq , in the presence of the Sheriff and most of the sub scribers. The new building having been completed, it was occu pied by the farmers for the first time, on Saturday, the 31st of August, 1839. The architects were Messrs. John and Benjamin Green. September. \u2014 This month the chancel arch and some ofthe columns of St. Hilda's Church, at Hartlepool, were removed, and the building greatly renovated. The chancel, probably from its being the Bruce mausoleum, was a most remarkable building, of nearly equal length with the nave, and having its columns, arches, and aisles of the same dimensions as that part of the church, and apparently more highly decorated. In 1719, it was almost entirely unroofed ; and a brief was granted by George I. to collect the sum of \u00a31,732 for repairing this and other dilapidated portions of the church, then so much decayed as to be in danger of falling down. It was agreed that the church and chancel should be continued at their full length and breadth ; that the roof should be flattened to four or six feet pitch ; and that the north wall, if advisable, should be taken down and rebuilt ; \" but in fear of y6 cash arising from ye brief may not answer y\u00b0 expectation, y6 said wall shall be referred until ye last ;\" \u2014 \"and as for ye chancel, y4 is referred until ye Earle of Scarborough's consent is got in writing.\" In the minute it is directed \" y' ye said church shall be new flagged, pued, and whitened, and in respect to ye glory of ye antiquity of sd church, what repairs ye windows may want, they shall be wrought after ye same model as they now are.\" The windows, however, without regard to \" the glory of antiquity,\" are filled with modern sashes. September 7. \u2014 The Forfarshire steamer, of about 400 tons burden, under the command of John Humble, formerly master of the Neptune, of Newcastle, left Hull for Dundee on the 5th of September, in a very unseaworthy state. On the 6th, when in Berwick Bay, having encountered a heavy sea, she was forced to put back, the boilers shortly after becoming so defective that she was left to the mercy of the storm. An attempt was made to run the vessel between the Fam Islands, but she refused to answer her helm, and at three o'clock on Friday morning, the 7th, she struck with tremendous force against the Harkers Rock, about half-a-mile from the Longstone Lighthouse, on the Farn Islands. A portion of the crew, intent only on self-preservation had lowered the larboard quarter boat and left the ship. Amongst them was the first mate, James Duncan, who has since published his own version of the affair, which was contradicted by the evidence of some of the wit nesses on the inquest, and reflects small credit on himself as a seaman. The stroke of the vessel on the rock was regarded as the signal of death. The master lost all self-possession ; and his wife, o"], [104, "98 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1878. who was on board with him, sought, in cries of anguish and despair, the protection which, alas, he could not extend. The cries of females on deck, mingled with the roaring of the ocean and the screams of the wild fowl, disturbed from their resting place, whilst tbe men clinging to the vessel awaited in silence their inevitable fate. Most ofthe cabin passengers were below, and many of them asleep in their berths. As soon as the vessel struck, the steward ran down and gave an alarm, but one passenger only, Mr. Ruthven Ritchie, of Ruthven Hill, Perthshire, was saved. On being awoke, he arose instantly, and Seizing his trousers, rushed upon deck, from whence, observing the sailors leaping into the boat, he, with an extraordinary effort, by means of a rope, swung himself into it, and was thus miraculously preserved. The uncle and aunt of Mr. Ritchie made a desperate effort to get into the boat, but in attempt- ing to leap on board, they fell into the sea and perished in his sight. The escape of the boat was remarkable. There was only one out- let by which it could escape being dashed by the breakers against the island, and that outlet was taken without the people being aware of it. The vessel struck aft the paddle boxes, and not above three minutes after the few survivors had rushed on deck, a second shock separated her into two parts, the stern quarter deck and cabin being instantly carried away, with all upon them, through a tremendous current called the Piper's Gut. The captain stuck to the wreck till washed overboard with his wife in his arms, and both were drowned. The situation of the few passengers who remained on the fore part of the vessel was perilous in the extreme. Placed on a small rock surrounded by the sea, which threatened to engulph them, they were clinging to life whilst all hope of relief was sinking within them, and crying for help, but the tempestuous billows drowned their feeble shrieks, and defied their puny efforts to escape. Their cries, however, were not unheard. Their shouts of distress fell upon the ear of Grace Horsley Darling, who, with her father, William Darling, occupied the outer Farn lighthouse. And now one of those heroic actions occurred, which for their romantic daring are remembered for generations with admiration, and pro- duced a burst of enthusiasm throughout Europe for the humble girl who performed it. She awakened her parent, and no other help nigh, those two brave persons proceeded, in a tempestuous sea, to the spot. It is impossible to speak too highly of this unparalleled act of humanity, bravery, and disinterestedness. Danger presented itself in a thousand forms on every hand\u2014 there the current run ning with fearful impetuosity, or the eddy whirling and engulphing all within its reach \u2014 mountains of water bursting in wild confusion, or the tempest sweeping the spray from the billow as it rolled along. This perilous achievement, unexampled in the feats of female forti - tude, was witnessed by the survivors in silent wonder, and down the weather-beaten cheek of one old seaman stole the big round tear, when he beheld, from the wreck, the noble exertions of a young female, of slender appearance, buffeting the storm and"], [105, "A.D 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 99 perillling her life for their preservation. By a dangerous effort the father landed on the rock, and the frail boat was preserved from being dashed to pieces by being rowed to and fro among the awful abyss of water hy the noble-minded girl. At length, at the risk of instant destruction, they succeeded in removing five of the crew and four passengers \u2014 all that were left alive \u2014 and the exhausted sufferers were savely carried to the lighthouse, where, for three days and three nights, their wants were administered to by the brave family to whom they owed their lives. The captain \u2014 John Humble \u2014 his wife, and about forty-eight others, perished with the vessel, and for some time afterwards the bodies of the sufferers, with portions of the wreck, were thrown upon different parts of the coast. The vessel and cargo were valued at \u00a320,000. The heroic conduct of the Darlings excited universal admiration, and meetings on the subject were numerous ; subscriptions and presentations of money and medals flowed from all quarters. The magnanimous girl, however, did not live long to enjoy the fruits of her heroism. She was not of a strong nature, and during the year 1841 she showed symptons of declining health, which rapidly ripened into consumption. Means were adopted to have her conveyed to Newcastle, but on her arrival at Alnwiek, the Duchess of North umberland would not listen to her proceeding further, and hired a suite of rooms for her in the airy part of the town, but all was of no avail, and she was shortly after again removed to Bamborough, where she expired on the 20th October, 1842, aged 25 years. Had Grace Darling lived in the remote ages, such heroism as hers would undoubtedly have been deified ; as it is her name even now will scarcely ever be forgotton. Such heroic conduct as that of this brave girl is without a parallel in the history of the world, for we do not read of another case of such disinterested bravery. Joan de La Pucelle was undoubtedly very brave, but she was a fanatic in her views, and compared with Grace Darling's disinterestedness, her bravery sinks into insignificance. A simple tablet is erected to her memory and that of her family in the graveyard of the ancient church of Bamborough, denoting the ages of the deceased, but no mention is made on the stone of the many brave acts performed by the young girl, who has made her name so famous, and which is, indeed, in itself, a lasting monument.

Mr. Burdon's share of the total cost (\u00a334,000) having been no less than \u00a330,000. The bridge, then considered a marvel in mechanics, and which, even at this day, can never be beheld without surprise and admii ation, was opened for traffic on August 9th, 1796. September 29. \u2014 An explosion took place this morning on board the Charlotte, Captain John Asterman, when lying at Seaham, owing to an accumulation of coal gas from the cargo. Six men were very seriously burnt, and two of them died shortly after. September. \u2014 One day this month, a remarkably fine colley dog followed the union coach irom Cockburnspath to Newcastle. With the field running the animal was computed to have run not less than 130 miles. October 11. \u2014 The town and neighbourhood of Newcastle was visited by a gale of wind, which was attended with considerable destruction of propeity and loss of life. A large chimney in course of erection at the soda works of Messrs. Ridley and Co., Ouseburn, Newcastle, was blown down, and the materials falling upon a house unoccupied, buried the whole in a mass of ruins. At St. Peter's Quay, nine men in the employ of Mr. Wallace, builder, Newcastle, were engaged in covering a shed in Messrs. Shields and Co.'s factory, the wind caught the roof and tore it completely off, carrying with it two of the men, one named William Redhead died shortly after, and the other had an arm and a leg broken. At Willington, a large piece of timber was blown from the railway viaduct, and fell upon a blacksmith's shop, 100 feet below, passing through the roof and breaking the handle of a hammer with which the smith was working. Instead of expressing surprise, the eccentric occupant named Wardle coolly took up another hammer and struck the iron whilst it was hot. A great number of serious losses occurred at sea. The northern yacht steamer sailed from the Tyne for Edinburgh with ten passengers, and a crew of thirteen. The gale, which had blown during the whole of the day, becoming more violent, one of the passengers, Mr. Reay, artist, North Shields, was put on shore at North Sunderland, after which the vessel proceeded through the Farn Islands, and was never more seen. On the 13th there was a heavy fall of snow, and as much of the harvest still remained in the fields, a portion of the crop was never gathered at all. October 14. \u2014 A coble belonging to Shields, with five pilots, left Cullercoats, and on trying to make Shields harbour the boat upset and they were all drowned.

November 8. \u2014 Ralph Stanley, a pitman, belonging to Holywell colliery, died from the effects of a wound in the abdomen, inflicted during a quarrel with Joseph Purdie, a farm servant. It appeared that Purdie was returning from Morpeth fair, where he had pur chased a sword stick. Several others of his triends were with him. When they arrived at the Astley Arms public house, near Cramlington, they were joined by the deceased, who had some ale with them. After leaving the Astley Arms a quarrel ensured, and Stanley wished to have possession of the stick. During the quarrel, Stanley received a wound in the abdomen, extending to the depth of six inches. He was observed to strike twice at Purdie before he fell. Verdict\u2014Manslaughter against Purdie, who was acquitted at the following assizes.

The police, on proceeding to examine the premises, were horror struck to find the body of a man lying extended on the hearth rug in front of the fireplace. Lights having been procured, a sickening spectacle presented itself. On turning over the body, which was that of Joseph Millie, assistant clerk of the institution, the features were found to be knocked in, the left jaw and cheek bone were broken, and the skull bore no less than twenty distinct wounds, some of them several inches in length. There were three large gashes on the left temple, and the skull was literally smashed to a jelly. The hearth rug was saturated with blood, and blood, brains, and hair bespattered the wainscotting and walls. A poker, considerably bent, was lying beside him, and the pockets of the unfortunate man were stuffed with several pounds weight of coal and paper, apparently the more readily to destroy by fire all traces of the horrid deed. On the other side of the room was next discovered the body of Archibald Bolam, the actuary of the bank, who was reclining on one arm, apparently half insensible, with a plaid wrapped round him, and blood slowly trickling from a wound in his neck. Surgical aid having been procured, he was conveyed on a chair to the house of Mr. Glen ton, Pilgrim-street, and shortly after he gave the following account of the shocking affair. He stated to Mr. Alderman Dunn and William Woods, esq., that he had lately received one or two anonymous letters, threatening bodily harm, at his dwelling at Gateshead, and that on Thursday evening one had been put under the bank door. In consequence of this he went over to Gateshead, leaving the bank unoccupied, Millie having gone to tea. When he returned, he found the door as he had left it, and on entering the room saw Millie lying on the hearth rug. This, he said, did not surprise him, as Millie also had a key, and he imagined that he had laid himself down to sleep. He went towards his own desk, but while in the act of opening it he was struck, as with a fist, on the right temple, and turning round found the blow had been dealt by a man with his face blackened and otherwise disguised. He then rushed shouting to the window, when the man threatened him with the same fate as that of Millie. Continuing his outcry, the man knocked him down and he felt a cutting at his throat. He then became insensible, and, on recovering, he heard the footsteps of a man in the waiting room, but durst not make any outcry, and shortly after the smoke again deprived him of consciousness. The news of this extraordinary tragedy soon spread through the town, creating au unparalleled excitement, and long before the time of the inquest, the Blue Posts, in Pilgrim -street, and all approaches thereto, were crowded to excess. At this examination, Bolam, the eldest son of Millie, and others, were examined. Bolam's statement was but an amplification of that before elicited, but it"], [109, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 103 appearing so incredible he was confined in the gaol. On the succeeding morning (Saturday), the publication of the evidence produced a general approbation of the measures adopted by the coroner, and the current of suspicion set in strongly against the accused. The country people attending the markets thronged in great numbers to the scene of the murder, and handbills were posted, offering a reward of \u00a3100 for the discovery of the per petrator of the deed. Public opinion, too, was in full sway, and various rumours were afloat respecting the present and past life of Bolam. On Wednesday, December 12, the inquest was resumed, and the examination of witnesses was continued on VIEW OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BANK. Thursday and Friday, when the jury at length returned a verdict of \"Wilful murder against Archibald Bolam,\" the statements of his housekeeper, Mary Walker, being so contradictory that she was given into custody, and afterwards examined privately by Alderman Batson, but no new facts were obtained, and she was, in consequence, set at liberty. About a month after, however, she was again apprehended and committed to prison as an accessory after the fact, but was eventually liberated. The greatest excitement prevailed in the town during the period of preparation for the trial. March at length arrived, and on the morning of the fourth, at half-past six, the prisoner was conveyed from the gaol to the Guildhall. Long before the hour of trial the populace had"], [110, "104 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1838. assembled on the Sandhill in immense numbers, and when the doors were opened a* tremendous rush took place, and the court was instantly crowded. The gallery erected for the convenience of the reporters was filled from end to end, and not a seat or standing place in any part of the court was left unoccupied. Mr. Dundas and Mr. Knowles, the prisoner's counsel, occupied the right of the judge's seat, the prosecuting counsel placed ARCHIBALD BOLAM. themselves on the left. Close by were Mr. Swinburne, the solicitor for the prisoner, Mr. J. T. Hoyle, the solicitor for the crown, Sir Gregory Lewin, the public prosecutor, Dr. Lynch, the medical adviser, and other functionaries of import. Precisely as the clock of the court struck nine, Baron Parke, the presiding judge, took his seat, accompanied by his colleague, Baron Alderson, with the mayor and sheriff of the town. In a few minutes the accused, dressed in a suit of black, was brought into court, attended by the officers of police. He slowly ascended the"], [111, "A.D. 1838.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 105 steps leading to the bar, where, shrunken, subdued, and alternated, he bowed low to the tribunals. The prisoner's counsel then applied for the postponement of the trial until the summer assizes, when the prisoner would have the benefit of a jury selected from distant parts of the county, and when the excitement would probably in some degree have subsided. After some discussion with the counsel for the prosecution G. Lewin, Mr. Wortley, and Mr. Granger), the postponement was granted, and Bolam having pleaded at the Moot Hall, was transferred to Morpeth ANOTHER VIEW OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BANK. gaol. Precisely at a quarter-past nine on the morning of the 30th of July, 1839, this extraordinary case came on for trial before Baron Maule, the counsel being the same as on the previous occasion. The prisoner was then placed at the bar, and bowing respectfully took up a position with both hands resting on the front of the dock. The evidence brought forward was purely circumstantial, but the points which bore most strongly against the prisoner were the trivial nature of the wounds and blows he had received compared with those of Millie, his pretended insensibility but real watchfulness and cunning wben found in the premises, the incompatability of his statements on the morning of the murder, with all the known facts of the case, the want of correspondence between some cuts on his cut with those on his waistcoat, and of both with several superficial scratches on his body, which he stated had been made by the \" black man,\" the remarkable fact that no cuts were to be found in his plaid, though it covered his body when found, and had never, he said, been removed since he VOL, in. p"], [112, "106 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1838. returned to the bank, the utter absence of blood upon the spot where he said he had been lying for several hours, the appearance of blood upon the sleeve of his coat, and the clear evidence that it had been attempted to be removed by water, the prevarications of Mary Walker as to the hour at which he visited his house on the evening previous to the murder, her admissions as to him sponging his sleeves, and many other points, in which his or her statements were contradicted by others. The whole of the evidence having been gone through the court was adjourned until the following morning at nine o'clock, when the prisoner was again placed at the bar. Profound silence reigned in the spacious hall, while Mr. Dundas addressed the jury for the defence, in a speech of upwards of two hours and a half duration, in which the most forcible facts adduced by the prosecution were attempted to be explained away. On the conclusion of the defence, the prisoner seemed much affected, and, indeed, the impassioned eloquence of the speaker had not failed to produce very material effect upon everyone in court. The judge then proceeded to sum up, aud in a manner so highly favourable to the prisoner, as to excite considerable surprise amongst both the bar and the public. Indeed, his whole address was more like a speech for the prisoner than a review of the evidence. The jury then retired, and after an absence of three hours, brought in a verdict of manslaughter. On the following day he was brought up for judgment, and after a solemn asservation by him of his perfect innocence, he was sentenced to transportation for life. The prisoner's only remark was \" My Lord, I regard that sentence as my death.\" Bolam, after his conviction and sentence, was con- veyed back to Morpeth Gaol, there to await her Majesty's orders for his removal to the Hulks. Whilst in Goal, Bolam spent much of his time in reading and writing. He entered greatly into conversation with his fellow prisoners, and often read aloud to them. For exercise, he walked for several hours daily in the yard attached to his cell, and usually selected one particular part, along the north-east wall, and his path upon the flags even now may be distinctly traced from the outer gate to the entrance of his cell. 1838 (December 19/ \u2014 A serious explosion occurred this evening in Wallsend colliery, near Newcastle.

It is remarkable that a little boy, who was riding in the cart at the time of the accident, and was found amongst the bushes on the bank, received no injury, beyond a few scratches. 1839 (January 7/ \u2014 The North of England was visited by a tempest, which, as regarded resistless fury and appalling magnitude, had not been equalled in this part of the country, and which bore a closer resemblance to a West Indian tornado than the storms which, however fierce, visit the temperate regions of our globe. Soon after midnight, the wind shifted from S. to W.S.W., and gradually increased in fury until about six o'clock in the morning, when its violence was perfectly frightful. It is impossible to de scribe the sensation felt during this period. Impenetrable dark ness veiled the face of nature, and when a sudden crash awoke the inmates of a dwelling, they knew not where to look for shelter amidst the ruin which surrounded them. At length morning dawned on a scene of devastation such as few have witnessed. Bricks, slates, and tiles, in broken fragments, lay scattered over the streets in every direction, as if the town had stood a siege. No one ventured abroad that could possibly avoid it, and every thoroughfare was literally deserted. The injury done to public buildings in Newcastle was very great. The Infirmary had three stacks of chipmeys blown down. The roof of the west wing was almost stripped, and twelve large trees in the garden were uprooted. At the Museum a sheet of lead, weighing nearly two tons, was torn from the roof and carried for upwards of 100 yards. St. Thomas' Church had four pinnacles destroyed. Much appre hension was at one time entertained for the safety of the beautiful steeple of St. Nicholas, but it withstood the tempest admirably. The balustrades of the Royal Arcade were completely destroyed, and the glass domes on the roof were more or less broken. The Grey Monument was observed to rock to and fro when the storm was at its height, but it suffered no injury. A chimney, attached to the brew-house of Mr. Strachan, Barras Bridge, between fifty and sixty feet in height, fell with a fearful crash upon the work shops of Messrs. Burnup and Co., much to the consternation of the men, who, however, escaped. A tall chimney at Elswick Lead Works, another at Mr. Burt's Steam Mill, in Thornton Street, and a third at Mr. Davidson's Tobacco Manufactory, in the Side, were blown down. The bark mill of Mr. Beaumont, in Darn Crook, also received much injury, the wands of the mill being torn off with great violence, and, after hovering a little time in the air, fell into St. Andrew's church-yard with a tremendous crash. A shed, upwards of three stories high, belonging to Mr. Arundel, skinner, Gallowgate, was completely demolished. A ponderous sheet of lead, weighing 18 cwt. 2 qrs. 14 lb., was torn from the top of Mr. Baird's house, in Northumberland Street, passed a few inches above the head of a person near the spot, and was driven with such violence against the house of Mrs. Coward, on the opposite side of the street, that the glass, frames, and shutters of two"], [114, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. 108 windows were shivered to fragments. The inmates, who were in the parlour, perceiving the lead coming, rushed out and escaped unhurt. At Byker, owing to the high position of the village, the damage to property was very great, and a little girl was killed by the overturning of a waggon. The river presented an extraordi nary spectacle ; and it may be noticed as one of the most striking evidences of the violence of the wind, that at the proper time of high water, the tide had not risen more than six inches above low water mark. The Fox steamboat was blown from its moorings, driven against the bridge, and sunk. It is truly wonderful that in such a scene of devastation as the town presented, so few injuries should have been sustained by individuals. A female, however, of the name of Hodgson, had her arm broken in consequence of being driven by the wind against a wall, and a man named Hugh Hutchinson was thrown down and rolled over and over like a ball for some distance. There were several other persons thrown down during the day in various parts of the town. In Gateshead the storm raged with even more serious effects than in Newcastle. Nearly every house upon the Fell was unroofed or otherwise injured. The beautiful chimney of the Brandling Junction Rail way Company, 115 feet in height, was blown down, and a man named Henry Hawks had one of his legs broken. A chimney, at Messrs. Abbot and Co.'s, 75 feet high, fell with a tremendous crash, and a man named John Errick was killed, while another person narrowly escaped. Scotswood bride was impassable through out the day, and a man who attempted to traverse it on his hands and knees, was blown against the chains and had his arms broken. The destruction of trees in the country was prodigious. At Chop well upwards of 20,000 trees were uprooted. Capheaton, Blagdon, Woolsington, Fenham, and many other seats were extensively injured. The most distressing accident occurred at the house of Mr. Orange, stationer, Bedford Street, North Shields. Mrs. Orange and the servant were in the kitchen, and what is remark able, almost an instant before the catastrophe, she euquired whether the servant remembered the wind that occasioned the fall of Mr. Spence's chimney three years ago, and before an answer could be given, a stack of chimneys fell upon the roof, carrying down the upper story, and burying Mrs. Orange in the ruins. She was quite dead when got out ; the servant escaped. In Sunderland the large chimney attached to Mr. Richardson's steam mill was blown down, and two men, named Robson and Moore (brothers-in law), were killed on the spot, and a third had his leg broken. At Morpeth the hurricane did considerable damage, unroofing many houses, blowing down chimneys, &c. The Royal Victoria Pavilion, belonging to \" Billy Purvis,\" standing in Oldgate Street, was shivered to pieces, the scenery, dresses, &c, blowing about the streets iu all directions. Upwards of 250 trees were uprooted in the park and grounds about Alnwick Castle. It is impossible to enumerate the whole of the disasters 'which occurred during this fearful hurricane, the foregoing being but a few of the more striking casualties."], [115, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 109 1839 (January 7/ \u2014 The storm had scarcely ceased to vent its fury on the town of Newcastle, when a fire broke out in the shop of Mr. Cowper, grocer, Grainger Street, which completely destroyed the stock and fixtures, but the property was saved\" by the exertions of the firemen. Januaty 7. \u2014 Married, iu London, Rowland Errington, esq., of Sandhoe, Northumberland, second son of Sir T. Massey Stanley, bart., to Julia, eldest daughter of General Sir John MacDonald. January 7. \u2014 Died, at his residence, Old Brathey, Windermere, aged 70, Thos. Stamp, esq., post captain in Her Majesty's royal navy. Captain Stamp was a native of Sunderland, a gallant officer, and conspicuous iu most of the engagements during the late war. Whilst on a cruise in the Mediterranean he had a tame lion on board, which used to follow him in his walks on the quarter deck like a lap dog, without any apprehension of danger by the crew. January 15. \u2014 An alarming fire took place at the Wear Glass Works, Sunderland, Messrs. Hartley's manufactory, which destroyed one of the pot rooms and large packing room, and consumed about \u00a32,000 worth of property in glass and pots. January lb. \u2014 That portion of the Brandling Junction Railway, extending from Redheugh to the depot at the east end of Hillgate, Gateshead, was opened amidst a great concourse of spectators. February 1 5. \u2014 An explosion of gunpowder took place in the ancient Keep of the Castle of Newcastle. It appeared that the occupier, Mr. Shipley, had been casting bullets for an acquaintance, when some powder became ignited and exploded with considerable violence, knocking down the partition wall, and setting fire to a number of muskets belonging to the yeomanry corps, and other things in the apartment. By the assistance of the police, the fire was got under without much damage. Mr. Shipley escaped com- paratively unburt. March 4. \u2014 On Monday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, a dreadful alarm of fire was created in the neighbourhood of East Percy Street, North Shields. A lady was retiring to rest, when she saw the flames ascending, and supposing it to proceed from a garden-house, the property of Mr. Robinson, brewer, she sent her servant out, who awoke several of the neighbours, and amongst them some of Mr. Robinson's men, when it was discovered that a stack of hay, the property of Messrs. Pow and Falcus, was on fire, which burnt with unabated fury until it was consumed. The fire was supposed to be the work of an incendiary. March 19. \u2014 A dreadful accident ocurred on the Clarence Rail- way. The passenger train from Crowtrees to Stockton had reached the curve on Mainsforth Carrs, near Bishop Middleham, when the engine was thrown off the line, and precipitated over the embank- ment. The passengers escaped uninjured, but the engineman, fire man, and guard were killed by the engine rolling upon them. Assistance had to be obtained to dig the sufferers out from beneath the ponderous machine, when their bodies were found so horribly"], [116, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. 110 mutilated as to render it a task of considerable difficulty to remove them. 1839 (March 20/\u2014 This day the banking house of Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart., and Co., was incorporated with the North umberland and Durham District Banking Company. The New castle bank was the second provincial bank established in England, having followed that of Pease, Liddell, and Co., of Hull, and had been established eighty-four year3. Few' institutions of the kind had obtained a higher degree of public favour and confidence. The senior partner, Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart., having re tired, the other members of the firm, Mr. C. W. Bigge, Mr. W. Boyd, Mr. C. J. Bigge, Mr. R. Boyd. and Mr. Spedding became large proprietors in the united establishment. The notes of the old bank were withdrawn, and the circulation became exclusively that of the bank of England. * March 22. \u2014 One of the boats belonging to the Grenville Bay whaler, of Newcastle, was manned under the direction of Captain Taylor, and proceeded to the Narrows, at the mouth of the Tyne, to make experiments with some guns which were constructed by Mr. William Greener, of Newcastle, for the purpose of harpooning whales. The result of the experiment showed that a harpoon of 12 lbs. weight can be propelled to a distance of 40 yards with cer tainty, having a f inch rope attached, consequently a fish may be thus secured, when it would be impossible to strike it with the hand. April 8. \u2014 Died, in the Circus-lane, Forth, Newcastle, Serjeant William Fraser, who had served 23 years in the 6th Dragoon Guards, and 20 years in the Newcastle and Northumberland Volunteer Cavalry. He was interred with military honours in the burial ground of St. Andrew's church. The deceased claimed to be heir male of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, beheaded in the Scotch rebellion. Had his claim been taken up in time and by influ ential parties, it is possible that the title might have been obtained for him. April 10. \u2014 As the train on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was passing Hallowell Dene, near Hexham, a cinder from the chimney of the engine fell on a thatched cattle shed belonging to Mr. Bell, of that place, and although immediate assistance was given, the shed was completely destroyed. April 19. \u2014 The first number of the \" Port of Tyne Pilot \" news paper was published at No. 7, Dean Street, South Shields. It was discontinued on December 30, 1812. April 20. \u2014 Two stacks of hay and one of straw, belonging to the Rev. Robert Goodenough, vicar of Whittingham, were destroyed by fire, and there was every reason to believe that it was the act of an incendiary. April 22. \u2014 An explosion of fire damp took place at Whitley col liery, and one man named Thomas Harding was most severely burnt. * See Sykes, August 22, 1755."], [117, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 111 1839 (April 26/ \u2014 The merchant vessel Tda, Captain John Currie, the property of Messrs. Johnson and Cargill, of Newcastle, arrived in the Tyne from the East Indies with a valuable cargo of sugar, sulphur, hides, rice, &c. This was the first vessel that had ever been bound direct from India to Newcastle, and her arrival excited much interest among the mercantile community. The bells of St. Nicholas rang a merry peal in honour of the event. April 30. \u2014 As police constable No. 17, Robert Bartram, was on duty near the Postern, about three o'clock in the morning, he heard cries as of a female in distress, and on approaching the grate of a common sewer, he saw a woman underneath. Implements having been obtained, the grate was lifted, and she was extricated in a most deplorable condition. Her name was Margaret Scott, and she must have wandered through the sewers for a considerable distance. April. \u2014 This month \" The Newcastle and Hamburg Steam Shipping Company\" was established. One of the company's vessels named the Clyde, the first steam vessel direct to Hamburg and Rotterdam from Newcastle, sailed from the Tyne on May the 6th. May 5. \u2014 Died, iu Hallgarth-street, Durham, Mrs. Margaret Gent, aged 100. May. \u2014 There was living at North Shields at this time, an ancient dame, named Hannah Conner, in her 100th year, possessing her memory and enjoying good health. May 20. \u2014 For some time previous to this date occasional meetings had been held in Newcastle and Gateshead, by a body of men calling themselves Chartists. Their object was the advocacy of universal suffrage, annual parliaments, vote by ballot, no property qualification for members of parliament, and the payment of representatives. Thcs3 meetings at last were so numerous that it would be impossible to notice them separately, but the assemblies which took place on the above day were of too important a character to be omitted, There were held by command of the National Convention, (a body which had been elected from each town and district in the previous November, and was still sitting iu London). About 10,000 persons met upon the Town Moor, Newcastle, the greater bulk was from the collieries, Newcastle having furnished very few. Mr. Thomas Hepburn was in the chair, and the principal speakers were Mr. Hume, Mr. Ayre, Mr. Charlton, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Cockburn, Mr. Stokoe, Mr. Rewcastle, Mr. Blakey, Mr. Harney, Mr. Mason, Mr. Currie, Mr. Knox, Mr. Devyr, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Lowrey, Dr. Taylor, and others. The language of several of those persons was highly inflammatory. A similar meeting was held at Sunderland, at which about 15,000 persons were present ; Mr. Williams in the chair. These assemblies, as well as those in other parts of the country, had engaged the attention of the government, and on the 15th of May a large quantity of ammunition arrived in Newcastle from the stores at Tynemouth, an order too was issued that sixty rounds of ball"], [118, "112 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. cartridge should be supplied to the troops throughout the country. Meanwhile, the people were acting on the suggestion of their leaders in every particular, money was withdrawn from the savings banks, and invested in a manner which they persuaded themselves was more profitable. The manufacture of \" caltrops\" and \" pike heads\" was becoming more and more the staple of those whose employment it was. Immense numbers made by the Winlaton men for 4d. and 6d. each, were sold to brother Chartists for ls. 6d., and men who formerly made less than 3s. a day, could now obtain 15s. by this illegal calling. The begging box, too, as it was called, was carried amongst the shopkeepers, and those who refused to contribute were soundly threatened and entered in a black book as marked men. Bands of sturdy beggars were continually prowling about the counties of Northumberland and Durham, committing petty thefts and felonies, accompanying injury with insult. Iu one instance four sturdy rogues took down some fish from the wall of a farm house, and entering the kitchen, cooly demanded that they should be cooked. In some instances the most brutal threats were uttered when not readily assisted with money and provisions, and a great degree of alarm was created among the inhabitants of lonely places. 1839 (May 21/ \u2014 That portion of the line of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway between Blaydon and the company's depot, near the Elswick Shot Tower, Newcastle, was opened with some cere mony. The opening for passenger traffic did not take place till the 26th of October. May 22 \u2014 Died, at Denton Hall, Northumberland, in his 60th year, Richard Hoyle, esq., merchant, of Newcastle. Mr. Hoyle was a native of Rippendon, in the west riding of Yorkshire, where his family had been settled for many centuries, and enjoyed extensive possessions. He was educated at Emanuel College, Cambridge, and pursued the study of chemistry with some success. In 1801, in conjunction with the late Dr. Stancliffe, he prepared a course of lectures on that subject for the new institution of the Literary and Philosophical Society at Newcastle, and his attainments in this branch of science enabled him to adopt many improvements in the process of various manufactures in which he was engaged. May 23. \u2014 A fire broke out in one of the cottages on Mr. Younghusband's farm at El wick, near Belford, which, owing to being thatched, threatened destruction to the whole of the buildings, but by the kind assistance of his neighbours, Messrs. Berwick, Hall, Bromfield, Bolam, Scott, and others, he was enabled to get the fire reduced, though not till four of the cottages were entirely destroyed. May 28. \u2014 The first coals from Garmondsway Moor colliery, the property of Thomas Richmond Gale Brad dy 11, esq., and partners, were shipped at Hartlepool. May 31. \u2014 A most destructive fire occurred on the premises of Mr. John Atkinson, coach-builder, in Newcastle. The fire was"], [119, "A.D 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 113 supposed to have originated in the smith's department, but at the time of their discovery, one o'clock, the flames were proceeding from the \" fitting-up shop,\" and long before anything could be attempted to arrest their violence they had spread with great rapidity over the adjacent buildings. In less than half-an-hour every street in the neighbourhood was crowded with persons, who stood watching in utter amazement the destructive progress of the devouring element. About two o'clock the fire was at its height, and from its immense body it presented an awful appearance, while the high wind which prevailed caused the utmost anxiety for the premises adjoining. The fire engines were speedily brought up, but for more than half-an-hour there was little or no water in the pipes, and the destructive progress of the fire was consequently unchecked for so long a period that all subsequent efforts to save the workshops were rendered futile. The efforts of the firemen were at last successful, though the dyehouse of Mr. Fenwick was entirely burnt down. The show rooms of Mr. Atkinson's premises contained a number of finished carriages, but by the timely arrival of a body of soldiers from the barracks, with two engines, it was preserved from injury, and the fire was got under about three o'clock, and by half-past three all danger of it spreading further had ceased. It is impossible to describe the scene of distress that presented itself on every hand during the progress of the conflagra tion. Every house in the neighbourhood was deserted, beds, bedding, and furniture of all descriptions were piled together in the middle of Pilgrim-street, and along Hood-street and Market street, even extending into Grey-street and Blackett-street. Women and children were to be seen in their night clothes, taking shelter beside their little all, whilst fathers and husbands rushed into the apartments they had quitted the moment before, in order, if possible, to save something out of the general wreck. As to the extent of the damage, there was much difficulty in forming an adequate estimate. Mr. Atkinson's loss was immense. The entire destruction of property, including the whole of the workmen's tools, was supposed to amount to \u00a322,000 ; the greater part of which fell upon the proprietor himself. Mr. Atkinson afterwards commenced an action against the Water Company for the deficient supply of water, but the matter was privately arranged. 1839 (June 13,). \u2014 The body ofa man was found in the river Wear, at Sunderland, attached by a rope to a large stone. The skull was fractured into numberless pieces; and the body was naked, save a flannel shirt and stockings. The body was removed to the workhouse at Monkwearmouth, where it was identified by two of the crew of the Ph\u0153nix, of Stettin, as that of their captain, Johann Friedrich Berckholtz, who was about fifty-five years of age. No doubt being held as to the deceased having met his death unfairly, instant search was made, and the cabin was found to bear evident marks of the deed. Subsequent investigation led to the committal of Jacob Friedrich Ehlert, the mate of the ship, and Daniel Muller, aged 19, the cabin boy, and they both confessed being accomplices o"], [120, "114 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1839. in the murder, but mutually charged each other with the deed. At the ensuing assizes at Durham the same assertions were reiterated, but from the statement of the boy, who was admitted a witness for the crown, it appeared that on the night of the Ilth, the mate, after giving him some spirits, induced him to go into the cabin where the captain slept, and while he (the boy) held a lantern the mate struck the unfortunate master three heavy blows on the head with a hammer, by which death was caused immediately. He then drew the body up to the deck, and with the assistance of the witness let it drop into the river by a line attached to it. They then got into a boat and rowed near to the bridge, dragging the body after them, and the mate having procured a stone, he tied it to the body, and let both sink into the middle of the stream. There were several circumstances in the boy's story corroborated by the crew and others concerned in the matter. The jury found Ehlert guilty, and he was executed at Durham on the 16th of August, persisting in his innocence to the last. He was a native ot Barth-Pomerania. 1839( June). \u2014 Aboutthe middle of this month, acurious discovery was made in the old tower of Durham Castle, which was then being restored for the purposes of the University. Amongst the rubbish in the lower crypt several bones of a whale were dug out, consisting of about 15 vertebra, 20 ribs, and the lower jaw bones. From a letter written by Bishop Cosin to his steward, Miles Staplyton, dated London, 20th June, 1661, in the possession ofthe Rev. James Raine, of Durham, the particulars of this discovery are clearly made out, as it there appears that this animal being cast ashore near Easington, the bishop ordered the skeleton to be prepared and placed in the old tower, where it was found. From the form of the jaws the species was conjectured to be the great spermaceti whale, which has seldom been observed on the British shores, only one taken in the Frith of Forth in 1769, being distinctly recorded. June 17. \u2014 The Newcastle Central Exchange and News Room, one of Mr. Grainger's most splendid erections, was opened by a public dinner. The magnificent interior of the exchange was tastefully fitted up on the occasion, seven large tables were laid out on the promenade for dinner, an excellent band played appropriate airs, an admirable marble bust of the duke of Northum berland, by Tate, and several other busts, presented by Messrs. Robson, Farrington, Barrow, Dodds, &c, were placed in various parts of the spacious building, and the dinner paity, consisting of 360 gentlemen, formed altogether a scene of the most gratifying description. The chair was ably filled by the mayor of Newcastle (John Fife, esq.;, and the vice presidents were Dr. Headlam, John Brandling, John Clayton, and Armorer Donkin, esqrs. June 17. \u2014 The Queen Victoria steamer, the property of Mrs. Strong, Milburn-place, North Shields, left the Tyne at five o'clock in the morning on a pleasure trip to Warkworth, with a numerous party on board. At about half-past eleven in the forenoon, when"], [121, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 115 a hearty country dance was in progress, the vessel struck with great violence on Hauxley Head, a few miles south of Warkworth. The effect of the shock was tremendous. Many were thrown on their faces, and all was confusion on board. The screams and cries of the women were truly heartrending, while some of the men were calmly imploring for mercy. One gentleman had seized a piece of timber with which to spring into the sea. A few young men were standing, waiting the \" parting heave,\" with their clothes unbuttoned ready to throw off ere they jumped into the deep. The boat by this time had nearly filled, the helm was seized by one of the passengers, and the vessel was forced as high upon the rock as she would go. It would be superfluous to state the joy that beamed from every face when six fishing boats came in sight and were in a minute or two alongside the steamer. The passengers were soon taken out and landed safe on the shore. In speaking of the gratitude of the party to the fishermen, one creature deserves notice who had been most lusty in the expression of woe in the hour of peril. He demurred to give his preservers (as the others did) one shilling, observing that sixpence from each was plenty, but possibly he estimated himself at his proper value. The passengers were brought home in six carts, and reached Shields at five o'clock on the following morning, in a miserable condition. 1839 (June \\8). \u2014 Being the anniversary of the battle of Water loo, that portion of the Brandling Junction Railway which connects South Shields and Monkwearmouth, was opened with due ceremony and rejoicing. Same day the Newcastle and North Shields Railway was opened, and both towns celebrated the event by the ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, the display of flags, and the usual demonstrations of rejoicings. The ladies and gentlemen invited by the directors were conveyed to Shields in two trains, drawn by the Wellington and Hotspur engines. The procession excited great interest all along the line, the sides of which were crowded throughout with the neighbouring inhabitants ; and the party arrived at Shields amidst the hearty cheering of thousands assembled. A liberal entertainment was provided for the company by the directors, in a tent at the rear ofthe residence of Abraham Dawson, Esq., who had kindly lent his mansion and grounds for the day. Upwards of six hundred persons partook of the dejeuner, Richard Spoor, Esq., of Sunderland, in the chair, with John Fife, Esq., mayor of Newcastle, on his right. There were arrangements, under the direction of Captain Potts, for races on Tynemouth Sands, but it was found impossible to adhere to punctuality, and the people were induced, by symptoms of a storm, to return to the village. There were a few who disregarded the threats of the heavens, and these paid the penalty of their audacity. The thunder began to peal, and big drops of rain to fall. The sporting lingerers fled ibr refuge to niches in the rocks, which afforded so little refuge from the storm, that in a short time they were wet to the skin, with"], [122, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D, 1839 116 a delightful compound of soft water and yellow sand. Meanwhile the inveterate racers ran the race, three in number, the spectators looking from their holes in the cliffs on the sport afforded by three jockeys on racehorses, splashing through torrents of rain in the midst of thunder and lightning. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the storm commenced at Newcastle. Rain continued to descend with the utmost fury for nearly two hours, during which time the quantity of water which fell, and the amount of damage done, was almost incredible. In many of the streets, even in elevated situations, the water flowed to the depth of three or four feet, and rushed forward with all the impetuosity of a cascade. The rush of water down Dean Street, the Side, Butcher Bank, and the narrow gorge leading thence to the Sandhill was tremendous. Three or four persons, who were carried off their feet, were washed a considerable distance, and narrowly escaped being floated into the Tyne. The lower part of Gateshead was flooded to a great depth. The water poured down the Bottle Bank like a cataract ; and near the bridge chairs, tables, cradles, &c, were floating to and fro. Cellars were filled, and in that of Mr. Atkinson, grocer, damage was done \u2014 chiefly in the melting of sugar \u2014 to the extent of at least \u00a360. Walls were thrown down by accumulated water in various places ; and at Tantoby, John and Catherine Teasdale, and one of their children were killed by the lightning, another child was injured, while a third, which lay in the cradle, was unhurt. At Beamish, six or seven men were thrown upon their backs by the lightning, but escaped without injury. An excavator named James Taylor, of Byers Green, was struck dead by the lightning ; and more or less damage was sustained throughout the district, either from the lightning or the flood. 1839 (June 26^). \u2014 Newcastle Races. \u2014 Wednesday, the Northum berland Plate was won by Mr. Lambert's br h St. Bennett (Lye). Thursday, the 27th, the Gold Cup was won by Mr. Orde's b m Beeswing (Cartwright). June 28. \u2014 At nine o'clock this morning, an appalling explosion took place in the west woi kings of the St. Hilda colliery, the property of Messrs. John and Robert William Brandling, at South Shields. Upwards of 150 persons were at work at the time in the pit, and their dwellings being contiguous or closely adjoining, the most agonizing scenes took place as soon as the calamity became known. It was certainly a most harrowing spectacle to behold the groups of people assembled, amongst whom could be easily recog nised relatives of all ages of the unfortunate creatures who had been exposed to the appalling dangers of this most frightful explo sion. Fortunately about 100 of the men were engaged at some distance from the west workings, and were enabled to esca pe. Several of these were nearly exhausted from the effects of \"choke damp,\" but in a short time many of them rallied, and by their generous efforts fifty lifeless corpses were with difficulty discovered and brought up, some dreadfully mutilated. The viewer of the pit, William Anderson, esq., was at the scene of destruction soon"], [123, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 117 aster its occurrence, and went down into the mine, where he remained till nearly one o'clock. Shortly after noon, Mr. Jobling, viewer of He worth colliery, went down in order to render assist ance. Mr. Mather, wine merchant, also descended the pit at an early hour, and administered to the brave fellows engaged in searching for the dead bodies such ren.edies as they stood in need of from prolonged exertion in the suffocating atmosphere. Among the sufferers was Joseph Argyle. aged 45 years. He descended the pit to look for his son, and was brought up a corpse. The brother of this poor fellow was with him when they were over taken by the choke damp, and urged him to retire, but he perse vered in seeking for his son, and fell a sacrifice to perental affec tion. The pit had been worked about fifteen years, and during the whole of that time no serious explosion had taken place, although the men invariably used candles, and it was supposed the accident bad taken place from some person having needlessly gone with an open light into a disused part of the mine. A large subscription wras raised for the relief of the unfortunate widows and orphans, in number more than sixty. 1839 (July 7). \u2014 Great sensstion was created in the Chartist Camp by the news that Dr. Taylor, one of their leaders, had been apprehended for sedition, at Birmingham. Crowds of people assembled at the corners of the street in deep and earnest discus- sion, and written placards were exhibited calling a public meeting in the New Lecture Room, Nelson Street, Newcastle, at six in the evening. By the hour of meeting the room was filled, and before the speakers arrived, it was crowded to excess. The speakers inculcated the purchase of arms, robbery, and instantaneous cessation from work. Such language as this brought George Julian Harney under the arm of the law, and near midnight two police officers arrived at Bedlington for his apprehension. He was found in bed at the house of Mr. Henderson, surgeon, and was quickly conveyed southward, passing through Newcastle at five o'clock a.m., and proceeding to Carlisle by the first train. On the afternoon ot the next day, two delegates (Reeves and Watson), burning with the news of Harney 's arrest, arrived at Thornley Colliery, Durham. For some time past the workmen of this dis- trict had been in a most unsettled state, and the harangues of those persons found ready auditors. The arrest of a political leader in times of excitement is always a matter of popular interest, and doubly so when ingeniously embellished by these orators, who related that \" he had been torn from his bed, from the arms of his wife, without time being allowed him to dress, and dragged to a gaol.\" In less than half-an-hour they had got a large body of men together, who proceeded to South Hetton and Haswell, forcing men into their ranks, or brutally threatening their being \"marked\" if they refused.\" It was 10 p m. when they arrived, tired and wet, at Sunderland Moor, in the expectation of being at the meeting, which was held there that night, but all was over when they arrived. From this date till the end of the month, meetings took"], [124, "118 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. place almost nightly in the Forth, Newcastle, and other places, and the most violent language was indulged in. Pikes began to be seen in the streets, and a Mr. Mason announced that 10,000 of these weapons had been ordered. The great recommendation of the speakers was that the Chartists should hold themselves in readi- ness for the \" Sacred Month,\" which was fixed by the National Convention to commence on the 17th of August, and which, it was expected, would revolutionize the country. The excitement seemed to increase with the number of the meetings. On the 20th, shortly after midnight, a fight occurred at the head of the Side ; a great crowd gathered round the pugilists, gradually in- creasing to several hundreds, who began to manifest indisputable signs of mischief. The policeman on duty (Cuthbert Ridley) interfered and was very roughly handled ; he sprung his rattle and displayed his truncheon in self-defence, but he was soon over- powered, thrown down and kicked in a savage and brutal manner. Four other policemen came up at the time and shared a similar late. An active officer named Leslie was seriously injured about the head. A prisoner named Bruce, whom he had in custody, and who was rescued by the mob, was the means of saving his life, by having him conveyed home in a state ot insensibility. The mob then commenced an attack upon the lamps, which were all put out, and next upon the Union Bank, in St. Nicholas' Square, the shutters and windows of which were nearly all destroyed. They then moved down Mosley Street and Dean Street, not a house escaping damage from brickbats and stones ; but the \" Tyne Mer- cury \" office, in the latter street, was a notable instance of then- vengeance, the window frames and glass being completely knocked to pieces. The respectable inhabitants of these streets were dread- fully alarmed, for the triumphant yells set up after each successive act of demolition were truly appalling. The police force by this time mustered strongly, and, with the mayor at their head, they soon succeeded in dispersing the rioters. On the 22nd, Messrs. Williams and Binns, of Sunderland, who had been at the head of the Chartists in that town, and had, on several occasions, made themselves conspicuous by seditious language, were also appre- hended and committed for trial. At the following assizes they were sentenced to six months' imprisonment. On Monday July 22nd, Archibald White, Peter Flannaghan, John Sutheron, John Thompson, William Campbell, Peter Devine, Peter Brown, Barnard Flannaghan, and Thomas Owen, were brought up before the Newcastle magistrates for examination. Sutheron was discharged, as he had only fought in self-defence. Peter Flannaghan was ordered to pay a fine of 20s. and 2s. 6d. costs, and in default to be imprisoned for a month. The remainder of the prisoners were remanded, on account of the non-attendance of Leslie, who was in a very precarious state. They were again brought up on the following day and committed for trial at the ensuing assizes, when a verdict of guilty was returned against Flannaghan, Devine, and White; Flannaghan was sentenced to"], [125, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 119 18 months', Devine 12 months', and White G months' imprisonment with hard labour, the other prisoners being acquitted. On the above day, the councils of Gateshead and Durham passed resolutions for the swearing in of special constables, with a view of putting a stop to the riotous assemblies which prevailed. On the 23rd, a meeting was held in the Forth, Newcastle ; but on the 24th, the mayor (J. Fife, esq.) issued an order for the dispersion of any future meetings held in the town, and invited the peaceable inhabitants to come forward as special constables ; 600 persons immediately responding to the request. Notwithstanding the repeated cautions which were issued by the authorities, a number of men from the country marched to the Forth on the 30th, and expressed their determination to hold a meeting. As soon as this was known the mayor and Dr. Headlam left the Manors on horse- back. On reaching Collingwood Street, they came in collision with a body of Chartists, when the mayor seized hold of a banner and a banner bearer, commanding an instant surrender, but he refusing, a sharp struggle ensued, in which a tailor from Whittinghani received a wound from a sword in the abdomen, and was instantly conveyed to the infirmary. Dr. Eeadlain and two gentlemen passing, came up and assisted the mayor, but being overpowered, the man broke away, and the whole body was allowed to proceed. The mayor and Dr. Headlam rode towards the Forth, and made another attempt to disperse the mob, the only effect of which was to cause a cowardly assault upon both of them with stones. The riot act having been r^ad four times without success, the police were ordered to march forward, which they did with some effect, seizing upon all the banners of the mob, and capturing several of the most active amongst them. The rioters next attacked the police with repeated volleys of stones, by one of which Dr. Headlam was slightly injured. But about this time a troop of dragoons and some infantry, under tbe command of Colin Campbell (afterwards Lord Clyde), which had been sent from the barracks, speedily put an end to the affray: The cavalry galloped along the streets, up passages and lanes, the affrighted people rushing in all directions to find shelter. One dragoon, whether from design or in the excitement and heedlessness of the moment, rushed down the Arcade at full speed, and without pulling up flew down, horse and man, the .^teep and lengthy flight of stairs leading into the Manors, and what is remarkable, neither received any injury. Mr. Dunn and Mr. Plummer, with a strong body of police, proceeded down the Side and other places, clearing the streets as they went. Before midnight about thirty rioters had been captured and lodged in the gaol. The next day, the 31st, the mayor issued a bill cordially thanking the special constables for their assistance on the preceding night, and strongly recommending that the peaceable inhabitants should either become special constables or remain in their own homes after nightfall, as by swelling the crowd they exposed themselves to danger, and materially increased the difficulties which"], [126, "120 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. the authorities experienced. The system of exclusive dealing was carried to a laughable extent in Newcastle about this time. A gentleman who had long been in the habit of paying a visit to a barber's shop in Blackett-street on calling one morning found the \" hall deserted,\" and on looking round the following notice caught his eye : \u2014 \" Any person frequenting this shop and acting as special constable will refrain from coming here in future. Signed G. Smith.\" The Chartist fiat had gone forth, \" Special constables shall henceforth shave themselves or be content to Wear their beards.\" Shortly after Smith was brought up for being drunk, and Mr. Inspector Little described his conduct as being \" very aristocratical.\" The police went through all the cookshops in the town to get him something to eat, but he refused to eat anything but roast beef. After this period the proceedings of the Chartists are almost wholly unworthy of notice. 1839 (August 3) \u2014 A seam of coal, three feet ten inches in thick ness, was come at in Wingate Pit, the property of Lord Howden. The seam is at the depth of 66 fathoms from the surface, and of first rate quality. August 7. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, suddenly, Edward B. Blackburn, esq., many years chief judge in the Mauritius, and late first commissioner to his grace the Duke of Northumberland. This melancholy event was deeply deplored by all classes of society, although his residence in the neighbourhood had been of short duration. August 19. \u2014 Dr. Clanny, of Sunderland, read an important paper in the hall of the Mechanics' Institution, South Shields, to the members of the Committee for the Investigation of Accident in Mines. It is due to this talented and scientific gentleman to state that he was the first to meet the difficulties of the mines by human ingenuity, and a lamp of his was in existence and used in some of the mines on the Wear long ere any attempt was made by any other person. The great principle of this safety lamp is that the admission of air is wholly from above the flame, so that the influence of currents acting laterally is in a great measure prevented. Another source of safety is that the wire gauze cylinder contains 1,296 meshes, while the \" Davy\" contains only 700 meshes to the square inch. August 30.\u2014 The opening of the Brandling Junction Railway, from Gateshead to Monkwearmouth, took place, when sixty-one waggons of coal, from South Beaumont Colliery, were conveyed along the line and shipped on board a vessel lying at Monkwear mouth Docks. This vessel, the \" Jane,\" of Aberdeen, Captain Goldie, was most fantastically dressed out with flags of various colours and designs, which floated in the breeze, giving an air of much animation and rejoicing to the scene. A sumptuous entertainment was prepared on the occasion, at the expense of the Wearmouth Dock Company, at which Sir Hedworth Williamson, bart., presided. On the 6th of September following, the entire line, from Gateshead to South Shields and Sunderland, was opened"], [127, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 121 for the conveyance of passengers and goods, when the distance from Gateshead to Monkwearmouth was performed in forty-six minutes, and the return trip in forty-three minutes. 1839 (August 31/ \u2014 A man, named John Henry Mooney, was seen falling head foremast from the third storey of a house of ill-fame in Silver-street, Newcastle, and was so severely injured that he died soon after, leaving a wife and family to mourn his wretched end. This outrage, it seem3, had been committed by two men, named Dwyer aud Spark, who, with the aid and counsel of some abandoned females, had given rise to a quarrel, and during the souffle he had been thrown out. Dwyer and Spark were tried at the next assizes, before Mr. Justice Coleridge, and sentenced to fifteen years' transportation. September 1. \u2014 Three boys were observed from the heights of Tynemouth in a boat, a long way out at sea, with a strong south- west wind, an ebb tide, and a good deal of lipper on the bar. Every moment increased their peril as they drifted further off; and as no means of rescue appeared at hand, Mr. James Mather, of South Shields, who had on former occasions distinguished himself in a similar manner, hastened down into the Haven, where, having found a pilot coble, and two men in it, and having prevailed on another man to join them, he caused the boat to put to sea. They at last got sight of the poor little fellows about two miles off. The coble bore down upon them, and on nearing the boat, the cries of the boys, who had given themselves up for lost, were truly heart- rending. An attempt was made to tow the boat, but it was found impossible ; the boys were therefore taken into the coble, and the boat abandoned. After great exertion and a good wetting, a landing was effected at Hartley Baits. Much praise is due to Mr. Mather, who liberally remunerated the men for their exertions ; and also to his intrepid companion, who were the means of rescuing the boys from a watery grave. The thanks of the committee of the Royal Humane Society, inscribed on vellum, was shortly after presented to Mr. Mather, through the medium of the president, his grace the Duke of Northumberland. September 9. \u2014 The foundation-stone of a new church was laid at Tynemouth, by M. Bell, esq., M.P., who appeared as the representative of his grace the Duke of Northumberland, who was unavoidably absent through indisposition. The site on which the church is built was presented by his Grace, together with a donation of \u00a3200 towards the endowment. Messrs. John and Benjamin Green, of Newcastle, were the architects for the building, which is a great ornament to the village of Tynemouth. The style of architecture is of the 15th century. There is a tower at the west end, surmounted by a spire, 95 feet in height. There are 500 sittings on the ground floor, 250 of which are free. September 15. \u2014 The rivers of Northumberland were flooded to a fearful extent, in consequence of the heavy rain which fell on the preceding day. The Coquet presented such a scene as the oldest living man never witnessed. The rain, to use a common VOL. III. R"], [128, "122 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1839. saying, \" fell whole water,\" and a gale from the east gave it a character of the most fearful description ; yet no apprehensions were entertained that the river would so far overflow its boundaries as to cause that destruction which was done. The appearance of the majestic stream from Felton Bridge was singularly picturesque, rushing from the deep woody recesses of Felton Park covered with autumnal spoils, and bidding defiance to the puny arm of man to rob it of trophies. For two hours it presented an unbroken stream of sheaves of corn, hay, trees, gates, and a great number of sheep. Mr, Spearman, of Warton, Mr. Story, of Caistron, and Mr. Armstrong, of Thorney Haugh, suffered severely. A poor hare was seen below Weldon Bridge sailing down upon a sheaf of corn, her frail bark was cast upon a savage shore, and the timid navigator fell a prey to barbarians. The corn grounds upon the Till were inundated, and the vale of Wooler was one sheet of water. The Wansbeck rose three feet higher than in the great flood of February, 1831. Mr. Leightley, of Bothal Haughs. lost a stack of hay about 3 tons weight, which, after being carried out to sea a few miles, was finally landed quite whole upon Newbiggen sands. The Reed and the other rivers flowing into the North Tyne were enormously swollen, but perhaps none so much as a small rivulet that winds its course close past the eastern side of the village of Otterbum. Every house in that village, with but two exceptions, was more or less flooded with water, and in many the inundation was several feet deep. At Hexham, the tan-yard of Mr. Ridley was completely overflowed, and considerable damage done to the bark liquor in the pits. The houses in the neighbourhood were so much flooded, that the chairs and tables floated in the rooms. Among the various articles washed down the Tyne, were large quantities of bobbins of cotton thread. Many of these were picked up atBlyth. 1839 (September 17/ \u2014 The port of Seaton Sluice was a secene of great rejoicing, in consequence ofthe welcome dinner given to Mr. James Thompson, the landlord of the Melton Constables Hotel, lately erected there, it being more than half-a-century since any improvements had been made in that town. The harbour there is one of great curiosity, having been cut through a solid rock, the entrance into which being 52 feet deep, 30 feet broad, and 900 feet long, and is well worthy the attention of the stranger. September 26. \u2014 The foundation-stone of an Episcopal chapel at West Herrington, near Houghton-le-Spring, was laid by the Rev. R. Shepherd, curate of Houghton. The Rev. E. S. Thurlow, rector of Houghton, erected the edifice at his own expense. This was the third chapel erected in the parish by Mr. Thurlow, in less than fifteen years. The chapel was consecrated September 8th, 1840, by the Bishop of Durham. September 28. \u2014 Died, at Witton Gilbert, near Durham, the Very Rev. Richard Richardson, D.D., in the 88th year of his age. He had held the perpetual curacy of Witton Gilbert for upwards of fifty-nine years, and was also precentor of St. David's, rector of Brancepeth, and chancellor of St. Paul's, London."], [129, "A.D. 1839.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 123 1839 (October 14/\u2014 Died, in East Holborn, South Shields, aged 103, Mrs Jane Brown. October 19.\u2014 A frightful accident occurred at the Ironside Pit, a few miles distant from Whitburn. Six of the workmen were sitting in the engine room, when the boiler exploded with a terrible crash, bursting the walls of the building, and burying the men in the ruins. Only one was got out alive, but so severely injured that his recovery was doubtful. Two of the deceased were brothers of the name of Russell, another was named William Hine, who left a widow and family. October 23. \u2014 His royal highness the Duke of Sussex arrived at Lambton Castle on a visit to the Earl of Durham. On November 4th he visited Durham, accompanied by Lady Cecilia Underwood, the Earl and Countess of Durham, and the ladies Lambton, when he received a congratulatory address from the corporation, and was entertained in the college by the Reverend Prebendary Ogle. Ou the following day, at a Provincial Grand Lodge of Freemasons, held at Chester-le-Street, a similar compliment was paid him. On November 7th his royal highness visited Newcastle. A few minutes before twelve o'clock a salute from the castle announced the arrival of the duke. He was accompanied by the Earl of Durham, in a carriage drawn by four splendid greys. His royal highness and friends proceeded to the Assembly Rooms, where they were received by a guard of honour, composed of the officers of the garrison and the splendid band of the 98th regi ment. Immediately after alighting, his royal highness, as Grand Master of the Ancient Order of Free Masons, proceeded to hold a lodge, and was met by about 300 Free Masons of the united lodges of the town and neighbourhood. The anniversary of the Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts was then held in the same building. The Earl of Durham presided, with the royal duke on his right, and was supported by a number of dis tinguished individuals of both sexes. Mr. Lockey Harle, one of the secretaries, read the committee's report, and the meeting was subsequently addressed by William Ord, Esq., M.P. ; Mr. East hope, ALP. ; Mr. Hutt, M.P. ; Mr. Hawes, M.P. ; Mr. C. Buller, M.P. ; the Duke of Sussex, the Earl of Durham, and others. After the meeting, his royal highness partook of a splendid dejeuner a la fourchette, prepared by Mr. Haigh, the keeper of the rooms, in a style of magnificence corresponding with the occasion. His royal highness, in the course of the afternoon, paid a visit to the Royal Exchange News Room, where he was received by John Brandling, esq., as chairman of the committee, who also intro duced Mr. Grainger to the royal visitor. Mr. Benjamin Green had also the honour of being presented to his royal highness, for the purpose of explaining his plan of a projected high level bridge from Newcastle to Gateshead. The duke and his noble friends then took their departure.

November 12. \u2014 His royal highness the Duke of Sussex paid a visit to the town of Sunderland, when he performed the interesting ceremony of laying the foundation stone of a large building, to be called the Athen\u00e6um. His royal highness was escorted to the ground by the Earl and Countess of Durham, the Earl and Countess of Zetland, Sir Hedworth and Lady Williamson, &c. A grand Masonic festival was held on the same evening, in the Bridge Hotel, at which the Earl of Durham presided. The plans of the building, which is in the Ionic style, were by Mr. Billington, and include a capacious hall for public meetings, a large lecture room, a library, a museum, and a number of other apartments. The building was opened the lst of June, 1841. November 29. \u2014 A horrible event was discovered on board a vessel lying at Berwick Quay \u2014 the Martha, schooner, of Cockenzie, William Ovens, master. At night, the crew, after putting the hatches on, went to bed, the captain and mate in the cabin, and the three seamen in the forcastle. In the morning, the mate, seeing none of the men stirring, went to call them, when he was horrified at discovering two of them lying dead, and a third nearly so. They had been suffocated by the fumes of the stove. The man still in life was removed to the dispensary, where means for his restoration were successfully applied. Dr, Edgar attempted to bleed the other two, but in vain. November 30. \u2014 The foundation stone of \" The Corporation Hall,\" Stockton-upon-Tees, was laid by Thomas Jennett, Esq , mayor, in the presence of a numerous assemblage of the inhabitants.

T. Young, esq., was called to the chair, who briefly stated the object for which the meeting was called, and was followed by A. Crighton, esq., who moved the first resolution. Dr. Lietch seconded it, and, in an able address, showed the necessity, importance, and advantage to be derived by the town being incorporated. Same day, a meeting of the ratepayers of South Shields was held for the same purpose, when a resolution in favour of the incorporation of that borough, was carried by a majority of 46 votes to 41. The Privy Council did not comply with either of the applications. January 5 \u2014 The body of a female was discovered in the river Skerae, a few hundred yards from Blackwell mill, by Mr. John Chismau and Mr. Rutter, who were walking ou the shore ou the way to Darlington. The young woman's name was Susan Dagley, a native of Coventry, who had worked at Messrs. Pease's mill for about nine months, and was missed from her lodgings at Priestgate, in Darlington, about five weeks previous. On examina tion, it was clear she bad been murdered and thrown into the river, but nothing was ever elicited to explain the mystery. January 6. \u2014 An inquest was held at Paston, in the parish of Kirknewton, on the bodies of two boys, sons of Ralph Turnbull, of Paston, who were unfortunately drowned in the river Beaumont on the preceding day. Tt appeared that the deceased aud another boy named William Martin, had gone down the river side, where a plank about fifteen inches is laid across, and that the children having hold of each others hands attempting to go along the plank, all fell into the river. The two Turnbulls were carried a consider able distance down the stream, but the other boy providentially got out. The bodies ofthe deceased were soon afterwards found, but life was quite extiuct. January 29. \u2014 Died, at Bedlington, aged 110, Mary Lorimer. She perfectly remembered the rebellion of 1 745, at which time she was in service at the High Church, Morpeth. February 1. \u2014 A dreadful collison took place in the river Tyne, near Friar's Goose. The London Merchant Steamer was going down the river on her voyage to London, and the brig Good Intent, from Lynn, laden' with flour, was sailing up, towed by the steam-tug Margaret, when they came violently in contact with each other. The Good Intent was struck on the larboard-bow, and in a few minutes went down. The crew had just time to save their lives. February 9.\u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 59, Mr. Luke Clennell, the celebrated painted and engraver. As a practical wood-engraver Clennell possessed great abilities ; but it is to his works as a designer and painter that we are to look more especially for the evidences of his genius. His powers in delineating rustic as well as marine scenery were very great ; and it is only necessary to"], [132, "126 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1840. advert to his painting of the Allied Sovereigns when in England, and the great price it brought in an unfinished state \u2014 through his lamented indisposition \u2014 to class him as a first-rate artist ; and to shew to what extent his talents were appreciated. Mr. Clennell was one of the most distinguished of Bewick's pupils, and his illustrations of Roger's Poems are unequalled as wood-engravings. In his youth he evinced unwearied industry, and was indefatigable in his exertions to attain that excellence in the higher walks of his profession, to which he ultimately arrived. His remains were followed to the grave by most of the artists of the town. A handsome marble tablet, by Davies, was placed in St. Andrew's Church, to the memory ofthe deceased. 1840 (February 10J. \u2014 This being the day appointed for the celebration of the marriage of her majesty the Queen with Prince Albert Francis Augustus Charles Emmanuel, of Saxe Coburg Gotha, business was entirely suspended in Newcastle, and every appearance of rejoicing was observable throughout the district. Flags were hoisted from the church steeples, and the ships in the harbour had a most animated appearance. The corporate body met in the Guildhall, and at one o'clock a company of the Newcastle Yeomanry, under Captain Loraine, took up their station on the Sandhill. The bells of the various churches rang merry peals, and the castle guns fired a royal salute, which was answered by a feu de joie from the volunteer corps, tbe whole concluding with three hearty cheers. At half-past four a public dinner was held in the Central Exchauge, at which 24 1 gentlemen sat down to a most sumptuous entertainment, the mayor, John Carr, esq., in the chair. Numerous dinner parties were held in the various inns, and in the evening, by order of the mayor, there was a grand display of fireworks on the parade ground. ' At night a fancy dress ball was held in the Assembly Rooms, and a very brilliant gathering took place. At North and South Shields, Sunderland, Durham, and all the towns and villages in the district, similar rejoicings took place, and the poor were everywhere most plentifully provided for. Upon the greatest Roman work in Britain, Sewingshields Crags, near Haydon Bridge, and one of tho wildest spots in the scenery of Northumberland, a bon-fire was lighted, and cast its ruddy glare over a vast expanse of country.

At this time, the Wesleyan body had within half-a-mile on each side of the river, between Tynemouth and Hexham, 38 chapels, capable of accom modating 17,300 persons, which cost in building \u00a328,300; and which also had 4,650 Sunday scholars connected with them. March 7. \u2014 A fire broke out this evening iu the house and shop occupied by Mr. William Cousins, tailor, Long Row, South Shields, and ia a short time the whole of the premises, as well as the adjoining public house of Mr. Samuel Yates, were completely de stroyed, and some other houses received considerable damage. In addition to this calamity, a little girl named Frances Place perished in the flames. The sufferers lost all their clothes and furniture. A public meeting was held on the Ilth, and a sub scription was entered into for their relief. March 14. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning in the cabinet work shops of Mr. John James, situated between Pilgrim Street and Erick Street, Newcastle. An immediate alarm was given, but the workshops, which were formed of three stories, being filled with furniture and dry wood, nothing could check the progress of the flames, until the destruction of the buildings and their contents was completed. March 20. \u2014 A dinner was given at the Blue Bell Inn, New castle, to Mr. Peter Gibson, Dean Street, commemorative of his having rescued three persons from drowning. A silver snuff box and a memorial narrating the circumstances, were also presented to Mr. Gibson. March 20. \u2014 The first iron ship seen on the Tyne arrived at Shields. The vessel, which belonged to Hartlepool, was called the \" John Garrow,\" John Wilson, master, and was 800 tons burthen. Her unusual appearance excited much curiosity. March 21. \u2014 The Thornley Coal Company, Durham, completed a sinking to a seam of coal never before worked in that district. It lies at a distance of eighty fathoms below the five quarter seam, and is four feet thick. This important discovery, which affected all the colliery districts of Durham, gave rise to much rejoicing. April 1. \u2014 A dreadful boiler explosion occurred at St. Anthony's Oil Mill, near Newcastle, by which two young men named Robert Wilson and Benjamin Giles lost their lives. Previous to com mencing work they sat down in the boiler shed, when, unfortu nately, one of the boilers burst, carrying away the door and part ofthe shed front, with the two poor fellows into the river, a dis tance of fifteen yards. The engineman happily escaped with trifling injury. April 2. \u2014 A fine vessel, named the Bucephalus, was launched from the dock-yard of Messrs. T. and W. Smith, St. Peter's near Newcastle.

The exhibition, which was of a most exten sive character, was entered by the Academy of Arts, Blackett Street, and consisted of a suite of eleven rooms, some of them of considerable size. This magnificent collection of every branch of art, science, manufacture, and articles of vertu, every species of machinery, apparatus, and experiment, every kind of handiwork, civilised or savage, every production of nature, whether terrene or marine, forming a concatenation of objects of value, interest, rarity, or curiosity, perhaps never before brought together, had been principally contributed by the neighbouring nobility and gentry, and by tradesmen of the town. The surpassing interest and brilliancy of the exhibition may in a great measure be attributed to the continued and extraordinary exertions of Messrs. Thomas Burnett and Henry Brady, the secretaries, Mr. John Hancock, the eminent naturalist, Mr. Albany Hancock, Mr. Joshua Alder, Mr. George Burnett, Mr. Joseph Watson, and others. So com pletely did the exhibition ensure the purpose for which it was intended, and so fully did the inhabitants appreciate the boon which had been conferred, that, although originally opened for three months, the exhibition lasted for five, closing in the midst of its popularity, and boasting in the aggregate little short of two hundred and fifty thousand visits by the holders of season tickets and others. To attempt anything like a detail of this wonderful and interesting collection would be in vain. A few of the more remarkable can only be mentioned. Magnificent paintings, micro scopes, and other optical instruments, English manufactures in porcelain, bronze, steel, and glass, a series of beautiful coats of mail, and a great variety of ornithological specimens by Mr. Han cock. Mr. Orde's racing trophies, by Beeswing, &c, &c. But the great centre of attraction was the New Music Hall, an immense room devoted to practical and experimental science and machinery. The centre of the hall was occupied by a large foun tain and circular canal, in and by the sides of which swam shoals of gold and silver fishes; and worked mills, syphons, pumps, steamboats, locomotives, screws, diving bells, rams, air forcing, and water pumps, and, indeed, every imaginable appliance of pneumatic, acoustic, hydrostatic, and electric science. On one side of the fountain and canal stood a beautifully polished steam engine of four horse power, manufactured on improved principles by Messrs. Hawthorn, of Newcastle, driving a power-loom for weaving merino, another for ribbon, and an iron planing machine. There were all kinds of mathematical, geographical, and astrono mical apparatus, and the room ran with the ceaseless din and clatter of engines, machines, looms, and printing presses.

J. W. Collingwood, esq., of Lilburn Tower, Northumberland, a seat which had been finished but a short period before, at an enormous expense. Mr. A. Spoor, builder, having obtained the consent of the corporation of Newcastle for the removal of White Friar Tower and a portion ofthe town wall adjoining it on the south, in order to the formation of a new street, the first act of demolition took place early in April, by the breaking of a large hole in the wall immediately beneath the tower, for the purpose of obtaining a passage for carts, which has since formed the roadway of Hanover street, extending from the brow of the hill, near Hanover-square, to the Skinner' s-burn. April 28. \u2014 The first steeple chase ever run in the county of Northumberland came off at Morpeth. The interest excited was very great. Four horses started, and the race was won by Mr. Lamplugh's Mischief, Norma was second, and Locksley and Donald Caird were not placed. April. \u2014 A new chapel, belonging to the Independents, was erected at Whorlton, near Barnardcastle, and in close proximity to the ancient church of that village. It was near this spot where the celebrated church reformer Wycliffe was born, whose life forms a portion of the history of his country and of Europe. He was born about the year 1324, and studied at Oxford, where he distinguished himself by his attention to his studies. As early as 1356 he inveighed against the authority of the Pope ; and in 1360 was active in opposing the mendicant friars. His subsequent life was spent in struggling with what he conceived to be abuses in the church, in which he was sometimes supported by the aristocracy, and always highly popular with the people. His opposition to the claims made by the Pope made him favourably known to many of the nobles ; whilst his doctrines were frequently subjected to the censures of the hierarchy. Like many other bold spirits, who have had the courage to denounce abuses, he was frequently led into extremes of an opposite character ; but his talents and learning were unquestionable, and he evoked a spirit of enquiry the effects of which are still felt, and will long continue to influence both the speculations and the practices of mankind. He died of paralysis on the 31st of December, 1384, at Lutterworth, of which he was rector ; and, 30 years after his death, his bones, by order of the Council of Constance, were taken up and burnt, and the ashes thrown into a brook. May 4. \u2014 The foundation-stone of a new church at Crook, in the county of Durham, was laid by G. H. Wilkinson, esq. It is calculated to hold between 400 and 500 persons, snd is dedicated to St. Catherine. The township of Crook and Billy Row was formerly annexed to the manor of Brancepeth. In 1764 an act of parliament was passed \" for dividing and enclosing a certain manor or common called Crook, in the parish of Brancepeth,\" but the impetous given to trade by the opening out of numerous collieries, has caused the place to become one of some importance. vol. in. s"], [136, "130 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1840. 1840 (May 1 ). \u2014 The supervisor of the Morpeth district and the riding officers of the Felton and Rothbury stations discovered an illicit still, most artfully constructed, in a sort of cavern at the foot of the Tosson Hills, near Rothbury.

May 22. \u2014 Died, aged 58, Charles Newby Wawn, esq., of New castle- upon-Tyne. Mr. Wawn practised for many years the profession of a surgeon-dentist, and at one time spread the influence of his name as a most skilful and talented operator from York to Edinburgh, and from the German Ocean to the Irish Sea. His manners were highly polished and refined, his intelligence varied and extensive, his benevolence unbounded, and his whole life regulated by the pure principles of religion. He cultivated music and the languages, and was extensively conversant with the Hebrew and its cognate tongues, with those of the two polite nations of antiquity, and with most of the languages and dialects of modern Europe. He wrote and spoke with great fluency. His style was rather ornate, distinguished by sweeping and accumulated epithet. Notwithstanding the extent of his practice, his labours in the cause of religion and humanity were untired and multitudinous. He published a series of well-written papers on cononial slavery, under the signature of \" Eleutheros,\" which produced a considerable impression upon the public mind. Mr. Wawn occasionally courted the muses, and some beautiful poetical effusions are the product of his pen. His writings, which are very numerous, are principally anonymous, and are scattered over the monthly and other periodicals of the time. Mr. Wawn died rather suddenly, at Tynemouth, to which village he had retired about two years previous. May 25. \u2014 During a fearful gale, the Ann and Elizabeth, of Sunderland, Captain Hall, took fire off the Girdleness. Fortunately, the Volunteer, of Charleston, Captain White, came up in time to take off the crew, as the ship was going down.

The family, on being aroused, made their escape, and by vigorous efforts the flames were subdued. June 12. \u2014 One of the boilers at the Birtley Ironworks, about five miles distant from Newcastle, burst with a tremendous ex plosion. Twelve of the workmen were severely scalded, and one of them died from the effects of his injuries. The boiler (weighing no less than 50 cwt.) rose in the air, one portion of it being carried to the distance of 200 and the other 150 yards. Few of the houses of the village escaped injury from the explosion. June 12. \u2014 Married, at Alnham Church, by the Rev. G. Wood, William, second son of Mr. Michael Thompson, long shepherd and topsman to Adam Atkinson, esq., of Lorbottle House, to Ann, third daughter of William Taylor, head shepherd to the late Mr. Crisp, of Prendick, and then holding the same situation under his nephew, Mr. H. Crisp. Mr. Crisp regaled the bridal party, consisting of upwards of twenty couples, to breakfast, and, after the ceremony, a keenly contested race for the \"spurs\" took place, from the church to the bridegroom's house, which was won, in grand style, by a lady, although matched against some of the most celebrated sports men of the county. June 16. \u2014 A goods train, on the Stockton and Darlington Rail way, took fire when near the former place, and a quantity of merchandise was destroyed. Teas, coffees, silks, flax, stationery, soap, charts, nutmegs, bibles, boxes of pills, &c, &c, were strewn in all directions. The loss was estimated at \u00a31,000. June 18. \u2014 A frightful accident occurred to the first-class train from Stockton. A man, named Prest, was driving a laden wood waggon on the turnpike road, at a point where the railway crosses, near Darlington, just at the time when the train was coming up. The gates were closed when the man came up ; but, notwith standing the engine was in sight, and the whistle was sounding, he persisted in passing through. The person in charge of the gate endeavoured to prevent him, but he got through and was partly across when the train came up, and a dreadful concussion took place. The three horses were killed, the waggon smashed to pieces, and the timber scattered in all directions. The waggoner, as well as the men on the engine, and the passengers, escaped without injury. June 29. \u2014 While an old man, servant of Mr. Collingwood, of Murton Farm, near North Shields, was in the act of taking a bull to its stall, it turned furiously upon him and mutilated him in a shocking manner, and such was the furious state of the bull as to bid defiance for s-ome time at all attempts to secure it."], [138, "132 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1840. 1840 (June 29/ \u2014 At the sessions held at Durham this day, Robert Taylor, alias Lord Kennedy, described as aged 1 9, was tried and convicted on a charge of bigamy.

The Marquis of Waterford, one of the stewards, rode his horse, Redwing, for the Hunter's Stakes, which were won by Captain Richardson's Centurion. His lordship's patronage of the sports attracted a large number of strangers to the town, and contributed greatly to the prosperity and success of the meeting. June 30. \u2014 Died, at his house, in Brandling Place, Newcastle, aged 32, George Richardson, son of Mr. T. M. Richardson. The deceased was one of the most rising landscape painters of the day, and his untimely death deprived the town of one that was likely to become its most celebrated artist. He was buried in the Jesmond Cemetery. June. \u2014 About the middle of this month, a workman connected with the St. Helen's Colliery, in the county of Durham, repaired to the bottom of the shaft for the purpose of being drawn up. Not finding the rope at the bottom, he actually commenced ascending the conductors of the shaft, which is 390 feet in depth, and in a very short time gained the bank. The individual who performed this rash and daring act was named Nixon, and, although of dwarfish stature, effected what probably not one man in a thousand would dare to attempt. July 1. \u2014 The Queen was pleased to confer the honour of knight hood upon John Fife, esq., of Newcastle, as a mark of approbation of the manner in which he had sustained the office of chief magis trate during the Chartist agitation, July 2. \u2014 A vessel called the Archimedes arrived in the Tyne from Leith, and was the first vessel propelled by Mr. Francis S. Smith's new patent screw. Her novel appearance attracted great attention, being rigged as a three-masted schooner, with not a sail set, nor paddle-wheel cases, and yet she was winding her way steadily and with great speed, easily passing numerous craft in her course. The engines were of eighty horse power, and the average speed of the vessel was nine knots an hour. July 6. \u2014 Died, at Great Malvern, Worcestshire, aged 58, the Right Rev. John Banks Jenkinson, D.D., Lord Bishop of St. David's, and Dean of Durham. His lordship was son of Col.

July 12. \u2014 The Oliver, two-mast ship, captain John Lamke, from Bremen, laden with timber, entered the Don, a tributary of the Tyne, which embouches in Jarrow Slake, and was piloted up by Matthew Rutledge, of Howdon. On reaching the eastern boundary of Messrs. Hindhaugh and Co.'s quay and timber dock, she was drawn to her berth by the numerous spectators, amid much cheering. Some years ago, two vessels, tho King and the Don, of about 300 tons burthen each, were built in this river, and consequently sailed down the Don ; but it is not on record that any vessel had sailed up the Don since the anchoring of King Egfrid's fleet in that river in the year 671. July 19 \u2014 The Queen steamboat left Newcastle, on a pleasure trip to Warkworth, with a large number of persons on board. Aster spending a few hours amid the surrounding scenery, the party returned, at three o'clock, to take their passage home. Three boat loads were conveyed to the vessel in safety, but on going the fourth time, just as the boat reached the steamer, the latter gave a lurch, which overthrew one of the men, and in the attempt of others to save him from going overboard, the boat overturned. A most painful scene ensued, but eventually sixteen persons were rescued; two others William Reay and Saiah Rutherford, being drowned. July 21. \u2014 One of those remarkable natural phenomena, a water spout, was observed about a mile south of Barnard Castle. The air seemed to be much charged with electricity, and the rain descended in torrents 'during the remainder of the day. July 28. \u2014 Died, at Cowes, Isle of Wight, aged 49, John George, Earl of Durham, Viscount Lambton, &c. From the hour of his lordship's arrival at Cowes, there appeared no hopes of his recovery, and he had been daily getting weaker, but his medical attendants considered he was not in immediate danger, and that the acute disease with which he was afflicted had been changed into chronic His lordship had not eaten anything for a week past, excepting a little fruit, and had only taken beef tea. His lady was his sole and constant attendant night and day, no one else even entered tbe room. On Tuesday morning, he was taken worse, and Mr. Day, of Cowes, was called in ; he immediately pronounced him dying \u2014 that he could not live five hours. At ten minutes past nine his lordship expired. The noble earl succeeded to the family property when only five years of age, on the death of his father. Soon after attaining his majority, in 1813, he became a candidate for a seat in the House of Commons, a"], [140, "134 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1840. vacancy for his native county having been caused by the death of Sir H. V. Tempest, he was returned without opposition. From that until he was called to the House of Lords, he continued to represent the county. In 1820, Richard Wharton, esq , was brought forward in opposition to him, but, after an exciting contest, Mr. Lambton was returned by an overwhelming majority, the numbers being Lambton, 1,731 ; Powlett, 1,137 ; Wharton, 874. Previous to this election, Sir Thomas H. Liddell (after wards Lord Ravensworth) wrote to Mr. Lambton, strongly condemning his political sentiments. The letter concluded with the following : \u2014 Your conduct, both in parliament and in the county of Durham, appear to me so dangerous and likely to do such incalculable mischief, that, even were you my own brother, I should oppose you by all the means iii my power.\" Mr. Lambton returned the following answer : \u2014 Dear Sir Thomas,\u2014 In answer to yours, I beg to say I feel gratitude for your frankness, compassion for your tears, little dread of your opposition, and no want of your support. Yours truly, J. G. Lambton. In 1821 he propounded a scheme of Parliamentary reform, by which the country was to be divided, for electoral purposes, into districts containing 25,000 inhabitants each, by whom one member was to be chosen. In 1828 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Durham, and in 1833 was created a viscount and earl. Shortly after, he went on a special mission to St. Petersburgh, to attempt to alleviate the sufferings of the people of Poland. In 1835 he was appointed ambassador to Russia. In 1838 he was sent to Canada as Loid High Commissioner, but he returned after a very short sojourn, not feeling satisfied with the support he received from the Government. His lordship married, first, on the lst of January, 1812, Miss Harriet Cholmondeley, who died in 1815 ; and secondly, Lady Louisa Elizabeth Grey, eldest daughter of the Earl and Countess Grey. He had issue by his first marriage three daughters, all of whom are dead, and by his second five children, two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Charles William, having died at the age of 13, his second son, George Frederick, succeeded to the family honours. The news of his death created a profound sensation, and, on the arrival of his remains at Sunderland, on the 3rd of August, all business was suspended, and nearly every house exhibited some token of mourning. The 10th of August being fixed for the interment of his lordship's remains, a deep and melancholy interest was excited. At Chester-le-Street, Durham, Sunderland. and South Shields, the shops were entirely closed, and the bells of Newcastle and Gateshead tolled from eleven to three o'clock. The preparations at the castle for the sad event were on the most ample scale. Refreshments were set out in the grand saloon, and as the company entered through the great hall hatbands and gloves were presented to them. In the great dining room the remains of the noble earl lav in state. This apartment presented a most impressive"], [141, "A.D. 1840.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 135 appearance, and great numbers were admitted to view the solemn scene. The outer coffin was of the richest description, being formed of the finest Genoa crimson velvet, relieved with gold ornaments. At half-past two the procession was formed, 140 of the tenants and agents of the estate preceding the hearse and four mourning coaches, about 300 Freemasons and 175 carriages following the body. The procession was upwards of a mile in length. The pall bearers were the Marquis of Londonderry, Sir Hedworth William son, bart, C. W. Bigge, esq., H. T. M. Witham, Esq., Lord Ravensworth, W. T. Salvin, esq., Dr. Headlam, and Colonel Tower. Tbe funeral service was read by the Hon. and Rev. F. R. Grey, and made a deep impression on the assemblage. The earl made his will in September, 1837, previous to his leaving this country for Canada, bequeathing the whole of his property, of every description, to the Countess of Durham, leaving her also sole executrix, a striking proof of his affectionate esteem and confi dence in her. 1840 (July 29/ \u2014 The Wesleyan Methodist Conference com- menced its sittings at Brunswick Place Chapel, Newcastle, on the morning of this day, being the 97th annual assembly of this body of ministers, and the first ever held in that town. The Rev. Robert Newton was elected president, and the Rev. Dr. Hannah secretary, after which the usual business connected with the conference was proceeded with. Two Ashantee princes were present during the proceedings, and excited much interest. The Rev. J. B. Freeman, a Wesleyan missionary at Cape Coast Castle, a man of colour, gave a deeply affecting account of a visit he had lately made to Coomasse, the capital of Ashantee, and a mission in that town was determined upon During the sittings of the conference Mr. H.

August 24. \u2014 The Queen was pleased to present the Rev. George Waddington, M.A., to the deanery of the cathedral church of Durham, void by the death of Dr. Jenkinson, late bishop of St. David's. On September the 23rd, Mr. Waddington received the degree of D.D. from the University of Durham, and on the 25th, he was formally installed at the cathedral. On entering upon his office, the very rev. gentleman presented the widow of his predecessor with a sum of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000, derived from new leases, on the ground that Dr. Jenkinson could have signed the documents before he died."], [142, "136 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D, 1840.

Hinde, esqrs., the members of the council, the corporation of the Trinity House, the stewards of the incorporated companies, and a large body of the leading merchants of the town. The party walked in procession from the Guildhall to the termination of the works, at the North Shore. The length of the new Quay is about 1500 feet, being 45 feet more than the Old Quay, and the whole of these extensive works had been completed to their then state in about thirteen months, under the direction of W. D. Anderson, esq , engineer to the corporation. September 3. \u2014 Two girls, aged 7 and 14, daughters of Thomas Wilson, of Stockton-on-Tees, were sent to a pond for water, and not returning in due time, their mother went in search of them. She found the pail, but could see nothing of the children. Shortly afterwards, a person passing, who had heard of the circumstance, looked into the pond and perceived their dead bodies. September 29. \u2014 As an engineman of Cramlington Colliery, named Patterson, was examining the safety valve of one of the boilers at that place, he felt a peculiar pricking sensation in the fingers. After several repetitions of the same sensation, he perceived that every time the feeling was accompanied by the issue of a spark from the metal. Mr. H. Lee Pattinson, a well-known practical chemist, having been made acquainted with the phenomenon, examined the apparatus, and found that the whole boiler was an immense electrical machine. W~ G. Armstrong, of Newcastle, the originator of the celebrated Armstrong Gun, obtained exactly similar results from experiments made upon a locomotive engine, and he subsequently constructed a \" hydro electric generator*' in the form of a small boiler, by which extraordinarily powerful results were produced. September. \u2014 This month, as two men, Edward Henderson and John Robson, were making a drain upon the farm of Mr. Forster Charlton, of Bog Hall, in the chapelry of Kirkheaton, Northumberland, the property of Calverly B. Bewicke, esq., they found, about two feet below the surface, under some large flat stones, the bones of a human body, which had been deposited in a large earthern jar. The remains must have lain a number of years, as the bones, on being exposed to the air, immediately mouldered into dust.

Upwards of a thousand cards of invitation were issued, and the brilliant assembly was graced by the presence of nearly eight hundred ladies and gentlemen. The whole affair passed off in the most admirable manner. All appeared delighted with the amusements of the evening, and all felt no less obliged to the worthy mayor and mayoress for having provided so splendid an entertain ment. The fancy dresses were numerous and elegant, and upon the whole interesting. They embraced the costumes of France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Germany, Tyrol, Naples, Poland, Albania, Turkey, Greece, Hungary, Persia, China, Circassia, Arabia, Canada, and Africa. Nor were the Highlanders, Brigand Chiefs, Courtiers, Robin Hoods, Huntsmen, Hamlets, old English gentlemen, &c, allowed to be forgotten. October 23. \u2014 A fatal accident occurred at Farnacres Colliery, near Ravensworth. The banksman, shortly before one o'clock in the morning, hearing a loud noise in the pit, threw a stone down the shaft, and found that it fell amongst water. He then shouted, but received no answer, and in a few seconds the shaft, which is 20 fathoms deep, was completely filled. The workmen, five in number, perished in the mine.

The interment of the deceased took place on the 6th of January, in St. Nicholas' Church, on which mournful occasion, every mark of respect was paid to departed worth by the clergy of the town and neighbourhood, as well as by the public at large. This year, the first organization of police constables for the county of Durham, under the new acts, was entrusted to Major James Wemyss, the chief constable. The force then consisted of 70 officers of all ranks, divided into four districts or wards, with a superin tendent for each, the chief constable residing at Durham, the head quarters of the force. The whole of the staff are efficient, and this is essentially necessary, as the duties of the police in the rural districts differ from the routine in large towns, being of a more comprehensive nature; and each constable, not being so immediately under the eye of a superior, is left more to his own discretion, and greater responsibility attaches to him. Hence the necessity of strict discipline, and the difficulty of always attaining the requisite degree of efficiency in a dispersed force. The gallant major, whilst in the army, had seen much active service ; and, as senior captain, led the final charge of the Scots Greys at Waterloo, the result of which was the final overthrow of Napoleon. During the conflict, Captain Wemyss had no fewer than three horses shot under him. He was afterwards rewarded with a pension.

Errington awoke about two o'clock in the morning, by his housekeeper shaking him violently, and telling him that she could not succeed in cutting her legs off with the axe, so that he must get up and take them off with the saw. On examination, it was found that the unfortunate woman had inflicted on one of her legs no fewer than thirteen cuts, the bone being splintered in several places. Her other leg was likewise severely injured. On inquiring into the cause of her so injuring herself, the only reason which she assigned was, that she could not enter heaven with her feet on. 1840 (December). \u2014 Died, this month, at Norton, near Stockton, aged 105, Mrs. Mary Wilkinson. 1841 (January 18/ \u2014 One of the heaviest disasters that ever befel the shipping of the river Wear, occurred on the morning of this day. After a long continued frost, which had covered the upper part of the river with ice several inches thick, a sudden thaw took place, accompanied with heavy rain, and the ice having been broken up by the flood, was brought down the river with great impetuosity. As the front sheets came down they met with obstacles at every turn ofthe river, the pieces behind were driven either under or upon them, and thus huge unwieldy masses were cemented together, to the depth of several feet. At length the barrier of ice yielded to the increasing pressure of water, and the mingled torrent rushing down with irresistible force, tore away whole tiers of ships from their moorings at the Hetton and Lamb ton Staiths, hurried them rapidly under the bridge, breaking their masts in the passage, and then dashing them against the vessels below, swept away tier after tier, and huddled them into a mass of wrecks, extending from one side of the river to the other. All who witnessed this scene of destruction, admit their utter inability to convey anything like an adequate idea of its terrors. The shouting of men, the shrieks of terrified sea boys, who had been aroused from their sleep by the noise of the ice rushing against the ships sides, the breaking of bowsprits, masts, and bulwarks \u2014 and all in darkness \u2014 formed a chaos of horror enough to appal the stoutest heart. When morning broke, it revealed such a picture of havoc as only such a night could have made. A number of ships had been carried out to sea, and were picked up by the pilots of Hartlepool and Seaham ; and others were sunk in the harbour, among which were the Newby, the Pilgrim, the Rosebud, the Kirton, the Seaflower, the Victoria, Les Deux Amis, the Caroline, four steam-tugs, and above thirty keels. The spectacle presented by the crowd of vessels, immediately above the more unfortunate craft just named, literally beggared all description. Scarcely a vessel in the harbour escaped without damage. So sudden and tremendous a blow to the very vitals of the commerce of the port, seemed almost to have stupified, for a while, those most deeply interested, but, rapidly arousing themselves from their temporary lethargy, the shipowners applied themselves rigorously to the rescue"], [146, "140 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1841. of their property, and, with the aid of steamboats, which had luckily taken shelter in the Wearmouth Docks, a passage was effected, and the ice went to sea. It could scarcely be expected that so frightful a destruction of property would occur without the loss of life. A boy belonging to the Richard, and a young man named Davison, belonging to the Newby, were drowned. The loss arising from tbe disaster was estimated at about \u00a3100,000. 1841 (January 20/ \u2014 Died at the Grove, near Durham, aged 78, Elizabeth, relict of Stephen George Kemble, esq. The deceased was the daughter of Mr. Satchel], and, in early life, was one of the first actresses of the day, her appearance in Newcastle being always hailed with great satisfaction by the audience. In almost every range of character she was eminently successful, she was allowed to be the best Ophelia on the stage, and she was equally excellent in Mrs Haller, Portia, Nell, Beatrice, Cowslip, Cicely Home-spun, <&c. Her remains were interred on the 28th, by the side of her late husband, at the Nine Altars, in Durham Cathedral. January 24. \u2014 Sunday afternoon, during a heavy squall of wind, then veering to the E., accompanied by a severe drifting fall of snow, the schooner Mariner, of Perth, which had sailed from the Tyne on Friday, the 22nd,, made her appearance again at the bar, and, as is too frequently the case in such emergencies, to escape from the danger of Tynemouth rocks, she kept too far south and ran upon the Herd. The steamer Advance attempted to approach the schooner to render assistance ; the sea at this time was dashing half-mast high over the vessel, when a sea swept the decks of the steamer, putting out her fire, and carrying two men overboard ; one was got back, but the other, George Goolock, was drowned : he attempted to swim to the schooner, and approached near to her, but there the crew had taken to the rigging, and no one could throw a rope to the perishing man, whose yells and cries in the agonies of death were audible to the crowds of spectators ou both sides ofthe river, but his appeals were in vain : he evidently had been accustomed to swim, and buffeted for some minutes with the furious sea ; nature at last became helpless, his piercing cries became less audible, and he sank to rise no more. Meantime this disaster was enacting, the South Shields life boat was speedily manned, and proceeded to the Herd ; the crew of the schooner were taken from the rigging, and soon after landed safe in the harbour. The schooner was afterwards got off the Herd, and brought into the harbour. January 29. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning in the naptha manufactory of Mr Thoburn, at the Felling Shore, near Gateshead, and the building was soon almost entirely destroyed. February 6. \u2014 A severe snow storm prevailed at this period, during which the rivers Wansbeck and Blyth were visited by flocks of aquatic birds. On the above day, at the High Pans, North Blyth, Mr. William Curry shot a swan, which was five feet ong, aud eight feet broad (from tip to tip of the wings). The"], [147, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE events. 141 length of the neck was about three feet, the weight of the bird about 281b. 1841 (February 8). \u2014 The body of Mr. John Wingate, of Newcastle, who had been missing for six weeks, was found in the Team, near Dunston. An inquest was held before Mr. Michael Hall, coroner, when, there being no evidence to show how he got into the water, the jury returned a verdict of \" Found drowned.\" Previous to the body being found, a remarkable instance of the sagacity of a Newfoundland dog occurred. For two or three days before the body was found the animal had been observed running to and from the place to the ironworks, barking and howling each time, but no one was induced to follow it. At length it was supposed the dog was mad, and, in consequence, it was shot ; and in about an hour afterwards the body was discovered, when the cause ofthe poor animal's excitement was made apparent. February 19. \u2014 This morning, a fire broke out in the ship building yard of Messrs. J. and C. Alcock, at Sunderland, which raged with great fury for three hours. Several fire-engines were put into operation, and, there being a plentiful supply of water, the flames were at length extinguished, after doing damage to the amount of about \u00a31,200. February 19. \u2014 About half-past eleven o'clock this evening, a fire was discovered to be raging in the magnificent and princely family mansion of the Marquis of Londonderry, at Wynyard Park, in the couuty of Durham, and, notwithstanding the utmost exertions of the servants, almost the whole building was consumed before the fire was subdued. It would be impossible to enumerate the immense quantity of valuable articles of furniture, &c, which fell a prey to the flames, but we may mention the several glass chandeliers, together with some immensely large mirrors, and beautiful stained glass windows, with numerous exquisite works of art, in statuary and paintings, amongst which were portraits of Queen Anne, George III., and Queen Charlotte, and the whole of the Tempest family pictures, not any of which were saved. The conservatory contained a number of camelias, 15 feet high, and a fine specimen of the Norfolk Island pine, together with 25 orange trees, in full growth, formerly the property of the Empress Josephine, with a number of other rare and choice exotics, all of which were totally destroyed. The damage was estimated at \u00a3150,000. The cause of the fire was never ascertained. The site of this mansion was formerly occupied by a hall, of the same name, which was the residence of the late Sir Henry Vane Tempest, the father of the then Marchioness of Londonderry. The building was commenced in 1822. The whole of the stone of this fabric was brought 26 miles, from a quarry on the family estate at Penshaw, Philip W. Wyatt, esq., architect. From the above it will be seen that the late hall had been upwards of nineteen years in building. At the time of this calamity, it was fast rpproaching towards completion, being expected to be finished in about another year."], [148, "142 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a D. 1841. 1841 (March 15/ \u2014 As some men were repairing the shaft of Cowpen Colliery North Pit, a fall of a large mass of old materials from the sides took place, which, descending upon the cradle, in which the men were suspended, precipitated four of them to the bottom ofthe pit, killing them on the spot. Another man caught hold of some timber attached to the shaft, and escaped unhurt. The sufferers were Joseph Wright, aged 37, who left a wife and three children ; Francis Reay, who left a wife and five children ; James Reay, who left a wife aud six children ; Stephen Heron, unmarried ; William Heron, the rescued pitman, was the brother of Stephen, and had a wife and young family. March. \u2014 Died, iu London, aged 29, Christopher Tate, sculptor, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, much and deservedly respected. The deceased served his apprenticeship with Mr. Davies, marble mason, and afterwards became an assistant to Mr. Dunbar, at that time residing in Newcastle. His talents as an artist were of a very superior character, and his first great effort was the royal arms, which grace the tympanum of the theatre in Grey-street. It is allowed to be a work a great merit, of which the people of Newcastle may always be proud as the production of a local artist. He likewise executed statues of \" Blind Willie,\" the Duke of Northumberland, Mr G. Straker, the Rev. J. Worsick, D. Urquhart, esq., &c. For some time prior to his leaving Newcastle, he was engaged upon a full length portrait of the Duke of Northum berland, intended to be erected on the area in front of the Master Mariners' Asylum, at Tynemouth. The state of his health was such as to render it imperative on him to leave his work unfinished, in order to proceed to a warmer climate. He took his departure from his friends, never to return, and to those who knew him, nothing was left but the melancholy consolation to be derived from the remembrance of his distinguished talents and many amiable qualities. The statue of the duke was finished by Mr. R. G. Davies. March 25.\u2014 During the night, a man named James Robinson, a joiner, who had been confined in the lock-up at Stockton, for examination on several charges of felony, pulled down the fire-place of the room where he was confined in, made a hole through the wall with one of the iron bars, and walked off without molestation. March. \u2014 This month Mr. Benjamin Green, of the firm of Messrs. John and Benjamin Green, of Newcastle, received a vote of thanks from the Institutions of Civil Engineers, in London, for a paper, accompanied by eight illustrative drawings, on arched timber viaducts, on the laminated principle, which Messrs. Green have so successfully employed in the stupendous viaducts of the Newcastle and North Shields Railway. March 30, \u2014 That important national undertaking, the Great North of England Railway, was opened by the directors, the shareholders, and a limited party of friends, travelling the entire distance from Darlington to York, where they were received by"], [149, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 143 the authorities of the North Midland Company, who had provided an elegant luncheon for the party. In the afternoon, the trains returned to Darlington, where a dinner took place at the Queen's Head Inn, to celebrate the event of the days G. H. Wilkinson and Thomas Meynell, esqrs., chairman and vice-chairman of the board of direction, presided in the like capacities at the table, and George Hudson, esq , and many of the directors of the North Midland Company, were among the guests. 1841 (April). \u2014 The Sunderland Herald records the following : \u2014 On the first of April, 1835, the wife of Mr. George Ormston, grocer, High street, in this town, gave birth to a daughter. Exactly two years after, on the first of April, 1837, she produced another daughter, and two years afterwards, viz., on the first of April, 1839, she again presented her husband with a girl. The thing had now become so regular that on this occasion Mr. Ormston informed some friends, who had met to drink the good lady's health, that if they would call on him that day two years they should have a similar pleasure. This promise came to the lady's ears, and, in order that her lord and master should not look like \" an April fool,\" she obligingly gave birth to another daughter on Thursday, the first of April, 1841. April 8. \u2014 A distressing and mournful suicide was committed at Trewhitt North Moor, near Rothbury, Northumberland, by Mr. Henry Boag, relieving officer to the Board of Guardians of the Rothbury Poor Law Union. From the evidence given at the inquest held on the body, before Thomas Adamjs Russell, esq., it appeared that some circumstances which had occurred in connection with the situation of the deceased had preyed upon his mind, and threats which had been used, that he would be watched, and, if possible, punished, produced such an impression on him, that on the night of Tuesday, the Oth, after a stormy meeting of the Board, he had never slept, but wandered about his room in great distress. The next day he had gone to Elsdon, in the performance of his duties, when he saw the Archdeacon of Northumberland, of whose kind feelings he afterwards expressed himself very warmly. On his return from thence he wrote a long letter to the clerk of the Union, from which the following are extracts : \u2014 My Dear Sir, \u2014 I do not see how I can get out of this business. The rector and Charlton will appear against me. Mr. Pye owns with having got the money up to the 25th of December, 1839, and it seems that I have carried the sum on in my books for three quarters more. I declare to my Maker that 1 was not conscious of it. The way we keep the books one can never see how the money stands. I declare I am innocent. The only thing I regret is in leaving my poor little children. Give my regards to Sir John Walsham, Mr. Orde, and all my friends. I am sure Sir John and Mr. Orde would do me justice. My eldest daughter is 18 years of age, and, therefore, can do for herself ; the boy about 13 years ; the next girl goes to her aunt, where she vull be well off; the next is a little darling, clever boy, about six years old ; the next about three years, but, poor little fellow, he is not right in his mind ; the youngest is one and half years. I hope some of my friends will assist them. You have been one of the best^ friends I ever met with. I regret leaving William Forster and his brother, and many, many"], [150, "144 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1841. dear friends. I am writing in as good spirits as ever I did in my life. I am perfectly reconciled to my fate. I have paid Charlton, of Tod Hill, \u00a32 2s. too much. You will find the accounts ri^ht to the 25th of March. I would not, on any account, have the rector or Thompson, the curate, to bury me. I do not care where I am buried. I am perfectly happy, and trust, prepared to die. I am, my dear Mr. Woodman, very sincerely yours, HENRY BOAG. After entering his own death in the register book, he left his house on horseback, about two in the afternoon, and was seen to look earnestly back towards it. He left his house at Warton, went to two or three places, till about six in the evening, when he had gone to a hovel upon Low Trewhitt estate, which was formerly his own property, and from whence he could look down upon the house where he had spent the greatest part of his life. He then swallowed an ounce of laudanum, after which he wrote in pencil, the following, upon the back of a letter : \u2014 \" I have taken about a wine glass of laudanum, at the shed on Trewhitt North Moor. God bless you all, except the rector and George Selby Thompson. It is getting nearly dark. I die at peace with all mankind, except the above. God bless you all ; good night.\" He had afterwards strangled himself with a rope fastened to the lintel. The jury found a verdict of \" Temporary insanity \" The remains of Mr. Boag were interred at Alnwick Church, and were accompanied to their last resting place by a great number of the Guardians of the Union, and his other friends, who voluntarily attended to testify the respect they entertained for him, who, while living, alike in his prosperous days as in adversity, had gained the good opinion of all who knew him. 1841 (April 15/ \u2014 A melancholy case of stabbing occurred in Newcastle, which terminated fatally. The person whose life was thus suddenly cut short was John Donkin, aged nineteen, an apprentice with Mr. Henry Robson, shoemaker, Eldon-lane, Percy-street. On the afternoon of the above day, the deceased was at work in his master's shop, where three other workmen were employed, namely, Henry Stokoe, Thomas Heppel, and William Cattermole. There were also three strangers in the shop, named Robert Oxley, Fenwick Chambers, and a man named Cruddace. William Cattermole was a person of weak intellect, and was often made the object of \"fun\" by his fellow workmen. A little before noon the deceased snatched off Cattermole's cap, and tossed it across the room, whereupon Cattermole quickly seized a knife and stabbed Duncan in the thick part of the thigh. Mr. Turner at tended to Duncan's wound, and he appeared to be doing well until the 18th, when mortification took place, and he expired on the 19th. Cattermole was \u2022 tried at the Newcastle Summer Assizes, found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to one months' imprison ment with hard labour. April 17. \u2014 Two splendid windows of stained glass, executed by Mr. Waiks, of Newcastle, were placed in the parish church of All Saints' in that town. The principal figures were St. Peter"], [151, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 145 and St. Paul, which were surrounded by twenty-sour coats of arms of the subscribers to this improvement. 1841 (April 19/ \u2014 A melancholy explosion occured at Willington Colliery, the property of Matthew Bell, esq., M.P., by which thirty-two poor fellows were suddenly hurried out of existence, whilst only three, out of thirty-five who were down the pit at the time, were saved. The first intimation of danger was a tremendous noise, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke issuing from the shaft mouth, and a violent shock in the neighbourhood, resembling what might be supposed to proceed from an earthquake. This noise was heard at a great distance, and in every direction, spreading dismay and terror amongst the friends and relatives of those who were employed in the pit. The remains of the sufferers were recovered two or three days after, many of them being very much burnt and mutilated. The cause of the calamity was attributed to the neglect of a poor little boy, a trapper, who left the trap-door in the north head-way, to which it was his duty to attend, to play with two other boys close by. May 10.\u2014 A grand military review took place on the Town moor, Newcastle. The 98th regiment of foot, commanded by Colonel Campbell, were presented with new colours by General Sir Charles Napier. The gallant general addressed the regiment at some length, and concluded with these words, \" Colonel Campbell, use your colours, and stand by them.\" In the evening, the officers of the regiment gave a grand ball and supper in the Assembly Rooms, to 250 ladies and gentlemen. May 17. \u2014 As some workmen were employed in a quarry on the Kirkharle estate, Northumberland, they discovered a worm embedded in the solid freestone. After exposing it to the air for three or sour minutes it died. May 18 \u2014 Sir Jacob Astley, of Melton Constable, Norfolk, and of Seaton Delaval, in the county of Northumberland, bart., was summoned to the House of Peers, as Baron Hastings, he being one of the heirs of Sir John de Hastings, summoned to parliament by the above title, in the 18th year of the reign of King Edward the first. On the 2nd of June, his lordship's tenantry at Seaton Delaval, celebrated the event by a dinner at Mr. Reay's, the Queen's Arms, Seaton Sluice. May 23. \u2014 Died, at Sandhoe House, Northumberland, aged 77, Edward Charlton, esq., a gentleman whose hospitality and generosity were almost proverbial. His funeral took place on the 31st, at tho. Catholic Cemetery, Hexham, when the shops, &c., were closed as a token of respect and regret. May 29. \u2014 A sad accident occurred at Derwent Crook Colliery, near Gateshead, the property of Lord Ravensworth and Partners. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the men connected with the works were sitting in the engine-house, taking their \" allowance,\" when they became suddenly aware that the boiler was exploding. They had but a moment for flight. The body of the boiler, weighing about four tons, became separated from the VOL, III. u\""], [152, "146 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1841. bottom, and was lifted entirely over the engine-house, alighting on the opposite side. Mr. Michael Almond, engineer to the colliery, was caught by a large detached portion of the bottom plate, which severed his arm from his body, tore the flesh from his side, and took off one of his legs. He expired in a few moments. Ten of the workmen were severely scalded, three of them afterwards died from the injuries they received. 1841 (May 31,) \u2014 Died, at Morpeth, aged 103, Mrs. Jane Stoney, June 7. \u2014 Andrew Hudson, of Little Bavington, while working in a limestone quarry at Cocklaw Walls, in the parish of Throckrington, Northumberland, sound the bones of two human bodies amongst a quantity of loose stones. The bones were collected and deposited in Kirkheaton Churchyard. June 7. \u2014 The following are the returns made by the enumerators of the population of Newcastle-upon-Tyne : \u2014 District of St. Nicholas, including part of the parish of St. John : 2,957 inhabited houses, 111 uninhabited, 52 building: Population \u2014 males, 7,558; females, 7,503; total, 15,061.

The borough of Gateshead, according to the new census, contained 19,000 inhabitants, being an increase of about 4,000 over 1831. June 7. \u2014 On the evening of this day. the inhabitants of Sandgate, Newcastle, witnessed such a scene of riot and outrage as had not being exhibited there sor several years. A number of the men belonging to the 87th regiment, stationed at the Barracks, were drinking at several public houses in Sandgate, and, early in the afternoon, were attracting the attention of the inhabitants and of the policeman on duty. No open rupture, however, took place, until somewhere about eight o'clock, when Mrs. M'Gallon, the hostess of the Green Tree, where there were three soldiers drinking, sound her company getting so uproarious, that, to save her articles from being broken, she called on the police to clear the house. One soldier who was lying drunk on the floor, was lifted up and assisted into the street, with a view of setting him on his way home. The soldier being seen thus accompanied, gave rise to an idea that he was in custody, und some person called out that"], [153, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 147 they were taking a soldier to the station house, when five of the corps, who had been drinking in the same public house, rushed out and insisted upon having their comrade. The policeman wishing to have the man out of the street, refused, when one or two of them were knocked down, and the others took out their batons and defended themselves as well as they could. The soldiers struck resolutely both with their fists and their canes, the populace, now greatly excited, took part with the soldiers, and a regular riot ensued. At one time at least 5,000 people were assembled, and it was with great difficulty the disturbance was quelled. In conse quence of the behaviour of the soldiers, the regiment was shortly after ordered to proceed to Hull. 1841 (June 8/ \u2014 A trout was caught with the rod in the Coquet, near Rothbury, by Mr. W. G Armstrong, of Newcastle, which measured 23\u00a3 inches in length, and 12i in girth, and weighed 4-lb. 7-ozs. He was taken in fair angling, in the middle of the day, and in a state of the water unusually low and clear. The exhibition of such a trout created no little sensation in Rothbury. June 15. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning, in Mr. R. Harrison's skin-yard, Stepney-bank, Newcastle, and, so rapidly did the flames extend that, notwithstanding every exertion, the whole of the premises were consumed, 1841. \u2014 In the early part of this year was discovered amongst the ancient records of the city of London, at the Guildhall, a contract between King Charles I. and the members of his privy council on the one hand, and the city of London on the other, by which the monarch seems to have made over to the corporation of London certain large tracts of land within the bishopric of Durham, by way of mortgage, as security for loans of certain sums of money, amounting in all to \u00a3300,000 of the money of that day. That the lands so mortgaged must have been bishop's lands is manifest enough, inasmuch as the crown neither had, nor could have, lands of its own within the bishopric which it could so pledge, under any colour of law, unless it were some of the forfeited manors of which, after the Refoi mation, the crown deprived the prince bishop, who claimed them as palatine. This document is quite perfect and bears not only the signature of the king, together with the royal seal, but also the signatures and seals of the Duke of Buckingham and other members of the privy council of that period. It appears that, the king never being able to repay this loan, these lands were afterwards sold by the corporation of the city of London, and form now portions of the estates (leasehold or freehold) of some of the great proprietors of coal in the county of Durham. The corporation of London at that time could not, of course, have the most remote idea of the mineral wealth that lay under the surface of these apparently poor lands, which, in modern times, would probably in a single year have paid off the whole of the royal mortgage.

About 500 men were immediately set to work, and various improvements were effected by them, particularly at the Cattle Market, Neville Street, and Stepney Bank, and in the drainage of the Town Moor, each man receiving 12d. and a roll daily. By the end of October, the demand for employment had diminished, the treasurer, Mr. Robert Robinson, notified a balance of little more than \u00a312 remaining in"], [155, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 149 his hands, after having expended \u00a3431 10s 7d in 8,411 days work, 7,325 penny rolls of bread, shovels, hacks, shapes, and other ne cessary expenses. 1841 (July 19.J \u2014 A violent thunderstorm visited Sunderland and the neighbourhood, doing considerable damage. A portion of a potatoe field, near Deptford, the property of Mr. Gordon Black, was completely ploughed up by the lightning. During the storm, the steamer Sun, of Newcastle (with upwards of 200 persons on board, who were on an excursion of pleasure), was proceeding up the river Wear, near Hylton, about four miles above Sunderland, when she struck upon an anchor, and received such damage that she filled with water and sank. A keel took the passengers on shore in safety. July 25. \u2014 While some boys were bathing at the Short Sands, on the north side of Tynemouth Castle, two of them, named Logan and Innes, were taken beyond their depth by a receding wave, and would inevitably have been drowned but for the timely asssistance rendered by Mr. Charlton, Mr. Gare, Mr. Edward Wilkinson, Mr. John Blakey, and a number of persons from Newcastle, who, plunging into the sea, succeeded in saving them. They were taken to the warm baths, and eventually restored to life. July. \u2014 For many years past the state of the Abbey Church at Hexham, had been the subject of reproach to the inhabi tants of the town, and a matter of regret to contemporaneous writers, who did not hesitate to point out and denounce the bad taste which could allow this noble building to be deformed by masses of rubbish, and behold its sacred precincts appropriated to ihe vilest purposes, without an effort to rescue it from such degradation. During this month, two of the houses, which had so long encumbered and dis graced the eastern front of tho Abbey Church, were being taken down, sor the purpose of being reconstructed in an improved style, when it was discoveied that the back ofthe erection had been built against the \" Ladye Chapel,\" and five elegant perpendicular windows were discovered. No sooner were the beautiful architectural fea tures of the building found out, than the interest of the well informed informed inhabitants was irrepressibly excited, and a desire became prevalent to procure the permanent non-occupancy of the sites, and. if possible, to effect the repair of a structure so long hidden from view \u2014so long appropriated to the vilest of uses. A meeting was convened in the Moot Hall, when preliminary steps were taken to purchase the adjoining property. En a short time a sum of \u00a31,500 was raised by subscription, and a portion of the old houses removed. The old Abbey Church of Hexham is an admirable and justly-celebrated edifice, the ornament and boast of the town. It is in the form of a Greek cross. In the centre is a square tower, 90 feet high. The transept is 156 feet in length, and the choir above 70 feet ; and there being no nave, the appearance of the whole is much injured. The centre arch of the choir is painted to represent a window of stained glass, and has a very beautiful effect. On each side is a niche, that on the right having"], [156, "[a.d. 1841. 150 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF a female figure, with a coronet and cross, designed for the queen of Northumbria, Etheldreda, the first benefactress to the Church. In the opposite niche is an effigy of her husband, Egfrid. The church is exceedingly rich in mural tablets and monuments, many of the inscriptions being in a good state of preservation, and consequently very easily deciphered. About half way up the choir, on the south side, in a pew, is a beautiful monument of black marble, inlaid with _ brass.

This is generally supposed to be the tomb of Alfwold, king of Northumberland, who was killed at Cilchester by a factious lord of his court, September 23, 788. This supposition, however, has been disputed by antiquarians, who assert that such monuments do not occur so early, and because scarcely a trace remains of the church in which Alfwold was buried. The altar is also very rich in carved work, and there are some curious specimens of the painters art of 800 years ago, and altogether the Abbey is well worthy of a visit. 1841 (August 5.) \u2014 A melancholy and dreadful explosion took place at Thornley Colliery, Durham, belonging to Sir W. Chaytor and Partners, by which one man and eight boys lost their lives. The accident was clearly traced to the negligence of one of the boys, who had inadvertently left open a trap door. Upwards of forty men were at work in another part of the mine, but they fortu nately escaped unhurt. August 5. \u2014 Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, of Middlesbrough on-Tees, brought their new ironworks into partial operation to-day, About two o'clock, a lump of iron, in a state, of fusion, was conveyed on a proper carriage to the \" squeezer,\" where it was kneaded (as a gentleman observed) like an old woman working a loaf. This squeezer is of great power and weight; \u2014 upwards of 20 tons. Its shape and action may be compared to the head of a huge crocodile, and some one had humorously chalked an eye on each side, and a row of large teeth on the jaw, which gave it the appearance of a mighty monster chewing red-hot iron. After the mass had undergone this process, it was quickly conveyed to the rollers, when Mr. Vaughan seized it, with a proper pair of pincers, and passed it through the rollers, amidst the loud and long continued hurrahs of the workmen and the company present. The different departments are so arranged that the huge masses of wrought iron can be moved from one part to the other for the necessary"], [157, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 151 operations, and finally shipped at the door, with the greatest facility and economy of labour. 1841 (August 9). \u2014 As three Middlesbro' gentlemen, Messrs. Garbutt, Thomson, and Lunn, were sailing up the river Tees, the boat unfortunately upset. They succeeded for some time in holding by the mast, two of them attempted to reach the shore by swimming, Mr. John Garbutt and Mr. James Thomson, and, after struggling for a short time, both disappeared. Mr. Lunn, the gentleman saved, was picked up by the Eliza steam-tug, after clinging to the mast for an hour and a half. The sufferers beinw so well known, the accident spread the greatest gloom in the neighbourhood. August 10 \u2014 Died, at the West Wall Cottages, aged 77, Mr. George Brown, schoolmaster, a well-known teacher of navigation, and author of the Tide Table, published in his name for many years, by Messrs. Mitchell, proprietors of the \" Tyne Mercury \" Newspaper. August 11. \u2014 This morning, as a man, named Bell, was passing along the Quayside, Newcastle, he discovered the body of an unfortunate woman, named Jane Anderson, lying in Blue Anchor-chare. Life was quite extinct, and it was evident that the woman had come to a violent death. The mystery was never unravelled. August 12. \u2014 Great rejoicings took place among the colliers of Murton, near Dalton-le-Dale, by whose exertions and zeal, guided by the indomitable perseverance and undoubled ability and enery of Mr. Edward Potter, the viewer and engineer, the South Hetton Coal Company had conquered difficulties considered insuperable, and succeeded in sinking through the sand at their extensive winning of Murton. Of all the mining operations which have engaged the patience and funds of the capitalist \u2014 the ability of the engineer \u2014 or harrassed and disappointed every exertion in order to the overcoming of difficulties apparently wholly insurmountable, perhaps we may not be wrong in stating it to be the most remarkable on record. It was in the autumn of 1838 that the sinking of five pits was commenced, and immediately there sprung into existence a host of smoky buildings, lofty chimneys, and mighty engines groaning and hissing in their ceaseless labours. A busy crowd of swarthy miners hurrying to and fro, all ready to obey the master hand, and to undergo any exercise of their peculiar vocation calculated to advance the marvellous work. Shrouded in an atmosphere perturbed and dark, and filled with noisome stench, day and night, laboured the mechanical powers, and, certainly not in a less degree, the sturdy miners. The operations went on satisfactorily until June, 1839, when a \" feeder\" of water burst out with extraordinary violence. So prodigious was the force of the eruption, that the limestone, four feet in thickness, which intervened between the bottom of the shaft and a stratum of sand, was completely forced up, and the quicksand instantly rose to the height of fifteen fathoms in one of the pits. It soon"], [158, "152 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1841. became apparent that unusual exertions would be required to overcome the water, which was discharged from the quicksand in enormous quantities. In June, 1840, the pumping power at work was equal to 1,500 horses, and the quantity of water delivered at the surface amounted to 11,000 gallons per minute, which created for itself a channel, where water had never run before. Thirty four large boilers, consuming one hundred tons of coal daily, were employed to furnish the necessary power ; and, owing to the effect of the sand upon the pump buckets, it was stated that the leather required for them cost for some time \u00a311 5s., hour by hour; and three tan-yards but served to supply the requisite quantity of leather. April 17, 1843, the proprietors succeeded in reaching the Hutton seam, at a depth cf 248 fathoms, and the cost of sinking, up to that date, was estimated at upwards of a quarter of a million sterling. 1841 (August 19). \u2014 Died, at Villa-place, Newcastle, Sarah Dickenson, aged 88 She was born on Gateshead Low Fell, where she lived till within a very few years of her death. Her mother (Sarah Fenwick) and herself were \" doctresses\" there for nearly one hundred years ; and, during that time, they nursed upwards of one hundred children, principally from Newcastle. Sarah Fenwick died upwards of 90 years of age ; and her daughter, Dorothy Wilson, also died at a very advanced age. They were all respectable in their several situations of life, and rendered great benefit to a poor laborious population for many miles around. August 31. \u2014 The Bishop of Durham consecrated the church of St Paul, Arthur's-hill, Newcastle. His lordship also visited the Infirmary, in his capacity of Grand Visitor, and was received in the governors' hall by the medical officers and P. G. Ellison, J. L. Loraine, Emerson Charnley, George BrumeU, Hedley Vicars, George Clementson, and John Bulman, esqrs., members of the House Committee. His lordship minutely inspected the wards, and made a highly eulogistic entry in the visitors' book as to the manner in which the institution was conducted. September 3. \u2014 At Charente, in France, a man fell into the river there, and must have been drowned, but for the prompt assistance of Mr. John Wardropper, of Sunderland. captain of the Marquis of Bute, who sprang overboard, and, at the imminent risk of his own life, after a severe struggle, ultimately succeeded in restoring the poor fellow to his friends. This was the third person who owed his preservation to the bravery of Captain Wardropper, exclusive of his rescuing the crew of a French vessel from shipwreck. September 15.\u2014 Sunderland was the scene of a contested election, consequent upon the resignation of Mr. Alderman Thomson (who became a member for Westmoreland, to the intense disgust and indigation of his former constituents). The candidates were Viscount Howick and Mr. Wolverly Attwood. On the above day the nomination took place, on hustings erected in front of the exchange. The 10th was the polling day, and, on the"], [159, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 153 morning of the 17th, the mayor. R. White, esq , made an official declaration of the poll from the hustings, the numbers being for Lord Howick, 705, Mr. Attwood, 463. After the company had left the hustings, Lord Howick's chairing procession was formed, when his lordship, seated in an open carriage, drawn by four horses, with music, flags, and a very large assemblage of friends, proceeded through the principal streets of Sunderland. On arriving at the Reform Tavern, Monkwearmouth, the scene was quickly changed into one of dangerous riot and confusion. Stones were thrown from the house, as large as half bricks, one of which struck Lord Howick, and this having exasperated the crowd accompanying him, they returned the attack, and broke some of the windows of the premises. The landlord, Mr. Edward Liddle, became much excited on observing the damage, and snatching up a fowling-piece, he presented it out of the window and pulled the trigger, but the gun fortunately missed fire. The house, in consequence of this rash proceeding, was almost completely gutted by the mob, and some injury was also done to the Bridge Inn and other taverns. On this serious disturbance taking place, Lord Howick was driven to Whitburn, the seat of Sir Hedworth Williamson, and endeavours were made to prevent mischief, but it was some time before hostilities ceased. Liddle was afterwards fined five pounds for his breach of tbe peace. 1841 (September 16/ \u2014 A melancholy catastrophe occurred at Long Newton, near Darlington. A bull, which had lately become unruly, was placed in a stable and chained to the manger, his horns also fastened thereto with a rope, by the son-in-law of Mr. William Stonehouse, of the above place, farmer. The latter person on going into the stable, and observing the bull tied by the horns, set to work to unloose the rope, not perceiving that the animal had got rid of the chain by having torn it from his nostrils. The bull, on finding himself at liberty, immediately attacked its defenceless owner, and, throwing him down, gored him in the most frightful manner. The son-in-law, hearing the cries of his father, flew to his assistance, and succeeded, in the most miraculous manner, in securing the animal, but too late to save his parent's life, as Mr. Stonehouse expired shortly after the unfortunate occurrence. September 17. \u2014 Died, at Lee Moor, near Alnwick, aged 69, Mr. Straughan ; on the 18th, aged 26, Miss Shanks, his niece ; and on the 19th, Mrs. Straughan, his wife, all greatly respected, and all in one house. September 21.*\u2014 Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart., of Blagdon, Northumberland, was married at Ampthill Church, Bedfordshire, to Cecilia Anne, eldest daughter of the Right Hon. Baron Parke. September 23. \u2014 The Northumberland Agricultural Society held its sixth anniversary for the show of stock, implements of husbandry, seeds, plants, &c, in the Bull Park, at the north entrance to Newcastle, when the attendance was very numerous. The band of the 61st regiment was in attendance, and played several fine VOL. in. v"], [160, "154 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1841. airs during the day. There was a first-rate show of horses, both in quantity and quality. Two grey ponies, the property of Mr. Atkinson, coachmaker, were much admired, as were a brown colt, the property of Mr. Lee, of Stocksfield, and a grey colt, the property ofthe Rev. Mr. Robson, of Ponteland. A brood mare, sent by Mr. G. H. Ramsay, of Derwent Villa, attracted much notice. Amongst the short-horned cattle there was a number of beautiful animals. Amongst the bulls, Mr. W. Ord, M.P., had a very fine one ; Mr. Angus, of Bromley ; Mr. Ridley, of Arbour House ; Mr. Scott, of Cambois ; and Mr. Crofton, of Holywell, each exhibited beautiful animals. Mr. C. H. Bainbridge, of Lumley Park, sent a cow which had already taken three prizes; and amongst the steers and heifers there \"s-ere some superior animals shown by Mr. Swan and Mr. Brown, of Newcastle ; Mr. Stobart, of Epperley, and others. Tbe show of sheep and pigs was extremely good, there being a number of first-rate animals exhibited. There was a large collection of agricultural implements, and several of them showed great skill in their formation. The varieties of turnips, potatoes, carrots, onions, &c, were in great profusion. Altogether the exhibition gave the utmost satisfaction. 1841 (September 29/ \u2014 While the wind was blowing hard from the south-west, Joseph Hutchinson, a ship carpenter, was coming down the river Wear, in a boat laden with sandstone, and had on board his son and daughter, who had been assisting him to load the frail bark. Between Claxheugh and Pallion Quay, the boat struck with violence against a raft of timber, and almost instantly sunk. Their situation was observed from the shore, but before assistance could be afforded they all perished. September 30. \u2014 The Highland Agricultural Society held their annual meeting at Berwick-upon-Tweed, which was thronged with strangers from all parts of the country. Sir Charles Gordon, the secretary, stated that the entries were numerous beyond precedent. There were entered for competition \u2014 cattle, 1 75 ; horses, 90 ; sheep, 653 ; pigs, 33 ; in all, 962. This was the largest show ever held by the society, or, as far as he knew, by any other society. A dinner took place after the show, at which the Duke of Richmond presided, the Marquis of Tweeddale being croupier. The Dukes of Northumberland, Roxburgh, and Buccleuch, the Earls of Buchan and Countown, Lord Howick, Lord Ossulston, Lord Templemore, and nearly all the landed proprietors of the district were present, the number of guests being 1,948. September 30. \u2014 The ancient corporation of Hartlepool, which had been for some time in a dormant state, with its fine property open to the aggressions of the unprincipled, was restored to life and vigour, her majesty the Queen having been pleased to grant a charter under the great seal for its re-incorporation. This charter was brought down from London on the above day, by Mr. Toase, the London solicitor to the corporation, and was read before the committee that night, when it was found that William Vollum, esq., was appointed mayor, and Messrs. H. S. Shearman, W.

Mr. Vollum's mayoralty was of short duration, as the charter appointed Monday, October 4th, for the appointment of a new mayor. A court of common council was held on that day, when W. John Vollum, esq., was chosen as successor to his father, \u2014 Stapylton, Esq , recorder, and Thomas Bell, esq., clerk to the corporation. 1841 (October 4s.) \u2014 One of the most extraordinary achievements of modern times \u2014 the removal of the lighthouse at Sunderland, in au entire state, from the site on which it stood for forty years, to the eastern extremity of the pier \u2014 was brought to a successful conclusion, in the presence of a great number of spectators. At a meeting of the Commissioners of the river Wear, the pulling down and re-erection of this lighthouse at the extreme end of the pier, which had been lengthened and improved, was fully discussed, when Mr. Murray, the talented engineer, proposed to remove it entire a distance of near 500 feet. His plans having been ap proved of, the masonry at the base, which was fifteen feet in diameter, was cut away, and timbers were inserted through the building, and extending seven feet beyond it. Above, and at right angles to them, another tier of timber was inserted, so as to form a cradle, or base, 29 feet square, and this cradle was to be sup ported upon bearers, with about 250 wheels, of six inches in dia meter, to traverse upon a railway laid for the purpose. The building, which was about eighty feet high, and weighed about 300 tons, was to be tied together with bands, and its eight sides sup ported with timber braces, from the cradle ujiwards to the cornice. The necessary preparations having been effected, the work of re moval was commenced, and, having been taken several yards in a northernly direction, the rails were laid to convey it forward to the eastern extremity of the pier, and from that time the operations were continued until the lighthouse was removed to its intended site on the new pier head. The rate of movement varied from one to two feet per minute, and the whole work was concluded without the slightest injury to life or property. The lighthouse being lighted up every night as usual, great credit was awarded to Mr. Murray, for his ability and success. The entire cost of the removal was \u00a3827, and the estimated cost of pulling down and re building \u00a31,800. October 7, \u2014 On this aud the three previous days an almost incessant rain fell throughout this district, in consequence of which most of the rivers in Northumberland were flooded to an alarming extent. The Tyne was so high that many of the cellars on the Quayside, at Newcastle, were filled with water, and, at the Stock bridge, considerable damage and inconvenience ensued from the bursting of the sewers. All the rivers in Northumberland were very high. The wild running streams, descending from the Cheviots, presented an imposing appearance, coming down with"], [162, "156 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1841. almost irresistable force, sweeping away embankments, and flooding the adjacent low lands for miles. The damage done by the Glen, in its mad career, to dykes, caulds, bridges, and corn in stook, between Newton and its confluence with the Till, was immense. At Blanchland and Allansford the bridges were nearly all destroyed, the Derwent having risen to a greater height than was ever known, with the exception of 1771. 1841 (October). \u2014 Early this month Mr. George Bates, innkeeper, Ponteland, vomited an asp, between two and three inches long, which he supposed he must have swallowed, or some of the spawn, while drinking water out of a ditch. October 19. \u2014 Between seven and eight o'clock this morning, a most determined act of suicide was committed, between Stockton and Norton, by a mau named Robinson, and which occasioned considerable excitement in both places. As a person named Har- rison, a grocer in Stockton, but who lodged at Norton, was on his way from the latter to the former place, he was met by Robinson, when au altercation took place, which was abruptly concluded by Robinson demanding the loan of \u00a35, and Harrison replying \" Of course not.\" The latter proceeded on his way, when, on looking round, he was startled at seeing Robinson close to him, with a pistol in his hand, which he instantly presented and drew the trigger, but fortunately it missed fire. Harrison struck him a blow on the arm and hurried away, with the intention of obtaining the assistance of the police. Robinson almost instantly left the foot- path, passed the end of the \" Brown Jug\" public-house, on the road leading to Fog's brick-yard, and, discharging a pistol into his own breast, gave a sudden spring, and then fell apparently dead. He expired before medical aid could be procured. Three pistols, all loaded with ball, were found upon him, and, it is supposed, he had tried them all upon Harrison. October 27 .\u2014 -A magnificent bazaar, in aid of the funds of the Northern Asylum for the Blind and the Deaf and Dumb, for which great preparations had been making for several weeks, was held in the Music Hall, Newcastle, being under the special aud illustrious patronage of Her Majesty Queeu Adelaide and Her Grace the Duchess of Northumberland, as well as a very numerous body of distinguished ladies connected with the northern counties. The greatest interest was created on the occasion, aud the town was literally thronged with visitors, who had come to give their sup- port to the meritorious object contemplated by the undertaking, and to witness the pleasing and animated proceedings amidst the galaxy of rank, fashion, and beauty that were assembled in the room. Stalls were occupied by the Countess of Hardwicke, Lady Ravensworth, the Hon. Mrs. Liddell, Lady Williamson, &c. The total proceeds of the babaar exceeded \u00a3934. October 28. \u2014 This morning, during a heavy sea, the Blyth Lifeboat Committee held a meeting at that place, when it was arranged to launch the boat for practice. The brig Sibsons was"], [163, "A.D. 1841.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 157 off the port at the time, and Mr. Hodgson, the owner of the vessel, and a crew of eleven men, embarked in the boat, Mr. Hodgson offering the men \u00a33 if they could reach his ship, but they had scarcely put off, when a heavy sea struck the boat and capsized it. Mr. Hodgson and one of the crew clung to the bottom of the boat and were saved, but the others were all drowned, in the sight of hundreds of people, who were totally unable to render any assist ance. The sufferers were Wm. Dixon, aged 60 ; Dan Dawson, 25 ; John Hodgson, 28 ; John Hepple, 22 ; Jas. White, 45 ; Peter Bushel, 21, all seamen; Edward Wood, carpenter, 35; Thomas Grieves, trimmer, 40 ; Robinson Burn, pilot, 44 ; and Henry Debord, shipowner, 56. 1841 (November Q). \u2014 The annual election of mayors aud other corporate officers took place.

Bell ringing and other signs of rejoicing everywhere prevailed. The Corporations of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, and other towns, afterwards voted congratulatory addresses to her majesty. hovember 14. \u2014 An alarming fire was discovered at Friar's Goose Colliery, near to Mr. Clapham's alkali works, South Shore, by which an extensive range of sheds, screens, &c, and a number of waggons were entirely consumed. The damage was estimated at \u00a3800. November 26. \u2014 Died, at Genoa, Louisa Elizabeth, Countess of Durham, relict of the Right Hon.

November 29. \u2014 The Tweed Bank at Berwick stopped pay ment. The transactions of the bank were very extensive, particularly in Berwickshire and the northern part of Northum berland, and its suspension caused great consternation in the district. The partners were William Smith Batson, John Wilson, and John Langhorne. A first dividend of 5s. in the pound was paid in July, 1842, a second of ls. 5d. in January, 1843, a third of 3s. lid. in July, 1843, a fourth of 6d in February, 1845, and a fifth of 3d. in January, 1850.

Robert Green, incumbent of All Saints', Newcastle, had the sepulchral brass of Roger de Thornton taken from its position in the vestibule of the church, and, on examination, found it seriously corroded. After a judicious cleansing, repair, and lackering, Mr. Green had it securely placed in a frame-work of wood, and, by hanging it in the vestry, a reasonable hope is afforded that this interesting relic will yet exist through many years. Mr. Green had intended to have defrayed the expenses incurred, amounting to \u00a315, by a subscription, but was prevented by the liberality of Mrs. Witham, of Lartington, Mr. Salvin, and Raleigh Trevelyan, esq., of Nether witton descendants of the great and good man), who preferred paying the expenses themselves. December 10. \u2014 William Hutchinson aud John Green, of Wingate Colliery, Durham, were brought before the Easington magistrates for a violent assault upon Edward Floordon, on the above day. It appeared that Green fastened a rope to Floordon's foot, Hutchinson took the other end of the rope and put it round the pit rope, which was going at the time. Floordon was instantly tossed head foremost down the pit, when, wonderful to relate, after descending about 16 yards, he caught hold of an ascending rope, turned himself upwards, and was brought safely to the surface. The magistrates convicted Hutchinson in the penalty of \u00a35, and Green in the penalty of \u00a31 and costs. 1842 (January 6/ \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, aged 82, Mr. William Tarn, a native of Newcastle, and one of the oldest freemen of that borough.

Porter and Latimer, was opened from the colliery to the river Tyne, near the Glass house bridge. The extreme length of the tunnel is 2\\ miles, total descent from the entrance at the colliery to the spouts for shipping the coals, 222 feet. This line of railway is worked by a stationary engine, the loaded waggons taking after them the rope to draw the empty waggons back. Twelve keels could be shipped in an hour. The waggons are of an improved form, invented by W. E. Gillhespie, the engineer who had the whole management of this stupendous work. The tunnel, from end to end, is arched with bricks, and has an inverted stone arch at bottom. The workmen, to the number of two hundred, were regaled with a substantial supper and strong ale, supplied by Mrs. Dixon, the worthy hostess of the Unicorn Inn, Bigg-market, Newcastle.

January 26. \u2014 Mr. Robert Simpson, of Newport-on Tees, farmer and merchant, was returning home from Middlesbro', at a late hour, when he observed three men proceed from the rear of his granary to the wharf, with well filled bags on their backs, and, concluding that they were carrying on a \" free trade\" in corn at his expense, he roused his servants to the rescue of his property. The suspected parties, hearing the alarm, threw down their bags, and ran off in opposite directions. The bags having been examined, were found to contain tobacco leaf. Subsequently several additional bags were found, and, with the three already seized, were conveyed to the Custom House, at Stockton, when the total quantity was ascertained to amount to 5,9481b. The duty upon this seizure would have been \u00a3934. January 26. \u2014 The weather at this period was extremely severe, with heavy falls of snow, and a tremendous wind blowing from the south-west. Coaches and conveyances of every description were almost entirely stopped, and the mails were also unable to maintain their time. Many disasters occurred at sea, and several lives were lost. The snow remained till the 29th, when a gradual thaw set in, in the course of which two boys were drowned at Stockton.

February 14. \u2014 A singular contrivance, to evade the payment of excise duty, was discovered on board the Vesta steamer, which traded between Newcastle and Edinburgh, by an officer of the ex cise. It appears that in examining the cargo of the steamer, he observed a large doll, dressed up in the gay attire of those which are usually sold in toy shops, but, on account of its being of extra ordinary dimensions, he after examining it minutely, perceived that the lady's head easily separated from her body, and that her neck formed nothing less than the neck of a large whisky bottle, the contents of which had, no doubt, been previously extracted. February 20. \u2014 Died, at Felton Vicarage, John Reed, esq , of Prestwick. and formerly of Chipohase Castle, aged 83, and on the 28th, at the same place, Miss Reed, his sister, aged 85.

Edward Lumsden and Son, Strand street, Monkwearmouth, was this day remonstrating with a workman, named James Robertson, for neglecting his work, when the latter lifted up a sledge-hammer, weighing about 61b , and struck the foreman a tremendous blow on the head. Liddle was carried home, and surgical aid procured. His skull ,was sound to be fractured, and the brain ruptured. He lingered insensible till five next morning, when death terminated his sufferings. Mr. Liddle was deservedly respected wherever he was known ; he had been 28 years in the service of Mr. Lumsden, and was considered one of the best workmen in the north. Robertson was tried at the Durham Summer Assizes, before Lord Denman, and was sentenced to transportation for life. February 26. \u2014 This day, was launched from Messrs, Smith's dock, St. Peter's, near Newcastle, the fine ship the Ellenborough.

February 26. \u2014 Died, at Lesbury, near Alnwick, aged 80, John Herdman, M.D. The deceased was the author of several medical works, and practised as a physician many years in London, with great success, having been appointed one of the physicians to H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex. He, however, relinquished his profession from conscientious motives, his opinions having become quite anti-medical, and were rigidly carried into practice. He considered that to minister to nature, and to conform to her operations by sobriety and regularity of life, were the only safe means to secure health ; and he entirely rejected the aid of medicine, as tending to derange and debilitate the system, declining assistance during his last illness, and declaring that he desired only to die a natural death. After his retirement from the medical profession, he entered into holy orders, and preached occasionally in Alnwick, Howick, and the adjoining parish churches. The doctor was a native of Fifeshire, and, by his marriage with Miss Hay, daughter of the late C. Hay, esq., of Lesbury, he succeeded to great wealth, which he diffused with a generous hand. He was a liberal supporter of public institutions, a munificent patron of the fine arts, and a kind benefactor to the poor and the distressed.

III. x"], [168, "162 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1842. at work, his wife and children being with him. They were, of course, both surprised and alarmed at the extraordinary intrusion. Mr. Watson soon came to their relief, and the cow was forcibly ejected. The damage done did not amount to five shillings, which the worthy butcher cheerfully paid. 1842 (March 13/\u2014 Died, at Alnwick Castle, aged 58, the Rev. Thomas Singleton, D.D., chaplain to His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, Archdeacon of Northumberland, rector of Elsdon and Howick, in the same county, and a prebendary of Worcester.

The three celebrated letters on Church Reform, written by the Rev. Sydney Smith, were addressed to Archdeacon Singleton, who was an intimate friend cf the witty canon of St. Paul's. Sir Henry Hardinge was his almost daily correspondent, and he usually spent a week at Tamworth with Sir Robert Peel during his residence as canon of Worcester. April 1. \u2014 The ship Georgina, of Newcastle, an Tndiaman, Captain Mitchell, bound to London from Calcutta, was lost by fire, attended with a deplorable sacrifice of human life.

April 27. \u2014 A public entertainment was given in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, to Sir John Walsham, bart., assistant poor law commissioner, by the gentlemen comprising the various boards of guardians of the northern district, as a mark of their approbation of the manner in which he had discharged his arduous duties during a period of six years, and of regret at his departure from the district. J. C. Jobling, esq , of Newton Hall, presided, and J. L. Loraine and J. Tinley, esqrs., acted as vice chairmen.

Monck, esq. ; John Brandling, esq. ; William Thompson Greenwell, esq. ; Charles"], [169, "A.D. 1842.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 163 Bacon Grey, esq.; Dr. Headlam; the Mayor of Newcastle ; the Rev. the Vicar, and other distinguished individuals in his immediate vicinity. After dinner the worthy baronet made the following observations on the comparative cost of working the old and the new poor law. He said \u2014 \" Last year it fell to his lot to compare the average of thirty unions in Durham, Northum berland, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, the old averages of which were \u00a3190,000 a-year. The new averages were \u00a3156,000, showing a decrease in favour of the new of \u00a334,000.\" 1842 (May 3/\u2014 Died, at St. Petersburgh, aged 62, Sir Robert Ker Porter, K.C.II , the celebrated traveller. The deceased was a brother of the well-known authoresses Anna, Maria, and Jane Porter, and was born at Durham in 1 780, being descended mater nally from two families long connected with the county of North umberland. In early life he manifested considerable ability in drawing, and, although having a strong preference for military life, it was deemed proper to cultivate his talents as an artist, and, about the year 1790, he became a student of the Royal Academy, under the auspices of Mr. West. In 1804 he was invited to Russia, and appointed historical painter to the Czar. During his residence at St. Petersburgh he gained the affections of the Princess Mary, daughter of Prince Theodore Sherbataff, whom he married. Sir Robert accompanied Sir John Moore into Spain, and shared in the hardships and perils of the campaign, which ended in the battle of Corunna. In ] 807 he was created a Knight of St. Joachim of Wurtemburg, and, on his return to England in 1813, he received the honour of knighthood from the Prince Regent, In 1819 ho was created a Knight of the Lion and Sun of Persia.

May 23. \u2014 A very ancient grave was discovered at Broom house, near Angerton, Northumberland, while getting materials for the new mansion erecting there for J. H. H. Atkinson, esq. It contained the remains of a female, placed in a sitting position, with short knives of bronze and flint, and ornaments of coal, the whole enclosed with flat stones, and was 45 inches broad and 27 high. It was supposed to belong to a period about 600 years before the Christian era. Many similar graves have been found on the Angerton grounds, and one of the same character was discovered about a month after this date, at Sweethope, upon the Wansbeck. May 25. \u2014 A terrific thunder storm occurred at Barnard Castle and its vicinity. At Scargill the farm-house of Mr. Bowron was struck by the lightning, when part of the west gable was thrown down, nearly every window in the house blown out, several of the doors thrown off the hinges, the whole of the vessels in the dairy destroyed, the ceiling of some of the rooms"], [170, "164 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1842. and part of the roof forced off. The escape of Mr. Bowron was most remarkable. He had just arrived at home, and had sat down to smoke his pipe, when suddenly the chair on which he sat was shivered to pieces, his gaiters singed, and he himself unhurt. It is impossible to describe the devastation the lightning occasioned. 1842 (May 25/ \u2014 The boiler of a locomotive engine, on the Stanhope and Tyne Railway, at Annsield Plain, suddenly burst, when the engineman, named Thomas Shevil, and the brakesman, Edward Riddell, were killed on the spot.

This celebrated mare had then won 23 gold cups and 50 prizes, and had proved herself superior to some of the first horses in the kingdom. July 10. \u2014 At an ordination held this day, at Auckland Castle, one of the successful candidates was Mr. Blythe Hurst, till lately a blacksmith in the village of Winlaton, Durham. After the toils of his laborious trade were daily concluded, he acquired, without any assistance, an acquaintance with English, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, French, and Sanscrit, \u00bbnd also taught himself to write. At a time when socialism was making much progress in the village, Mr Hurst published a little pamphlet, entitled \" Christianity no Priestcraft.\" This work having fallen into the hands of the Bishop of Durham, his lordship . caused inquiries to be made concerning Mr. Eurst, as to his mode of study, and desired Mr. Douglas, the rector of Whickham, to pay the blacksmith a visit. Mr. Douglas found him toiling the whole day to support his family, pursuing his studies while at work, having his lessons on his flame stone. Mr. Douglas conversed with him, and subsequently made a report to the bishop, who eventually gave the poor scholar the means of following that course of life for which he had long pined, Mr. Hurst passed his examination with the highest credit, and remained some days on a visit to the bishop at Auckland Castle, shortly after which he entered upon his ministerial duties as curate of Garrigill, near Alston. July 10. \u2014 This day, Mrs. Isabella Carnaby, landlady of the Duke of Cumberland public house, Close, Newcastle, threw herself out of the attic window into the street, from the effects of which she died shortly after.

Doubledee, came off. The race was from Newcastle Bridge to Lemington, which was won easily by the London rowers. 1842 (July 18/\u2014 A foot-race, for \u00a3150 a-side, took place near Durham, between two men, named Atkinson and Whitehead. About 15,000 persons were present. Atkinson fell about 20 yards from home. July 2fi. \u2014 The body of a young woman was found on the sea shore near Hardwicke, Durham, under circumstances which left no doubt that she had been murdered. It was at first supposed that the deceased was the daughter of a person named Dixon, resident at Wolviston, that she had been seduced by a young man, who, having since been married to another woman, had murdered the deceased and fled. During the inquest a some- what singular illustration of the dangerous tendency of circumstantial evidence was adduced. The brother, father, and sister of the girl missing from Wolviston swore to the deceased being that individual, and their evidence was corroborated by a woman who swore that the stays which were produced, and which were taken trom the body, were made by her for the girl in question. After this apparently conclusive evidence the coroner consented, on the application of the father, to give up the body to him for interment. Before, however, it had reached its intended resting-place, a police- officer, who had been in quest of the supposed murderer, arrived with the information that both he and the missing girl were alive and well at Lofthouse, in Cleveland, whither the father, by the direction of the coroner, immediately proceeded, and actually sound his daughter. The body was then brought back, and the inquest was adjourned till Friday, when it was clearly proved that the deceased was Jane Jackson, the daughter of a respectable man at Easington. No further particulars could be ascertained, but the conviction was strengthened that the unfortunate woman had been brutually murdered. August 25 \u2014 The marriage of Lord Prudhoe, second son of Hugh, second Duke of Northumberland, to Lady Eleanor, eldest daughter of Earl Grosvenor, and granddaughter of the Marquis of Westminster, was solemnized this day at St. George's Church, Hanover-square. At the same time, Lord Parker, eldest son of the Earl of Macclesfield, was united to Lady Mary Frances Grosvenor, second daughter of Earl Grosvenor. His Grace the Archbishop of York officiated at both marriages, in the presence of a very distingu'shed circle of the relatives and friends of the Northumberland, Westminster, and Macclesfield families. September 7. \u2014 An American seaman, named Michael Smith, aged 23, proposed to leap from the east side of Sunderland Bride into the Wear. His intention was announced by handbills, and at the time fixed thousands of persons assembled to witness this daring and novel exploit. On arriving at the centre of the bridge, he was preparing to throw himself off, when he was seized by the police, who conducted him to the station- house, to the great"], [172, "166 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1842. disappointment of the spectators. Next day he was brought before the magistrates and bound over to keep the peace. About six o'clock in the evening of the same day, determined not to be diverted from his purpose, Smith went privately on to the bridge, and despatched his companions to apprize certain parties who had befriended him of his determination to leap. Having perched himself on the summit of the lamp-frame, from whence, waving his cap, gallantly he sprung into the river, a height of upwards of 110 feet. On reaching the water he struck out, and swam like a \" sea bird\" to a keel, from whence he saluted the spectators on the bridge and on the heights, in the style of a true Jack Tar, which was immediately returned by a round of hearty cheers from the astonished multitude. Smith took another leap on the 15th, which was witnessed by 30,000 spectators, and was performed successfully, though Smith's body was slightly bruised by its sudden contact with the water, the high wind then blowing having thrown him into an angular position whilst falling. 1842 (September 15/ \u2014 The celebrated racing mare, Beeswing, the property of William Orde, esq., of Nunnykirk, closed her wonderful career on the turf by winning the Doncaster Cup, This was Beeswing's fifty-first victory, and the twenty-fourth gold cup which she had won, a number quite unprecedented. After having eight foals \u2014 four colts and four fillies \u2014 several of which proved themselves worthy descendants of \" the Pride of the North.\" Beeswing died March 4th, 1854, near Chestei, aged 21. September 23. \u2014 John Thompson, a tailor, of Sunderland, in a drunken freak, declared that he would that night rival Smith the diver, by jumping off Wearmouth Bridge, which rash act he performed. He was picked up, a few minutes after, quite dead. September 27. \u2014 A grand musical festival commenced in St. Nicholas' Church, Newcastle, for the benefit of the several charitable institutions established in the counties of Northumberland and Durham. The instrumental performers were 64 in number, and the chorus consisted of 163 voices, the whole being under the direction of Sir George Smart. Amongst the principle vocalists were Madame Caradoni Allan, Miss B. Hawes, Miss Birch, Miss Pyne, Mr. H. Phillips, Mr. Hobbs, Mr.. Machin, Mr. Ashton, &c, &c. The church was fitted up with galleries for the accommodation of the patrons of the festival, as well as for the performers, and tho arrangements, generally, were considered admirable. The performances on the first morning were of a miscellaneous character, on the 28th Haydn's \" Creation,\" and Rossini's \" Stabat Mater,\" with passages from Handel's \" Israel in Egypt,\" and on the 29th Handel's \" Messiah'' occupied the whole morning. On each of the three evenings there was a concert at the Theatre. The festival concluded on the 30th with a grand fancy dress ball in the Assembly Rooms, which was attended by nearly 600 of the nobility and gentry. The ball was led off by the Marchioness of Londonderry and M. Bell, esq., M.P., and, from the extraordinary magnificence of many of the"], [173, "A.D. 1842.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 167 dresses, the scene was one of the most brilliant ever witnessed in the town. Unfortunately, the musical festival, with all its merit, turned out to be a failure in a pecuniary point of view. The total receipts sor the church and theatre were \u00a31,865, while the expenses amounted to about \u00a32,665. The deficiency was made up by the subscribers to the guarantee fund. 1842 (September 30).\u2014 A grand bazaar, in aid of the Natural History Society and the Society sor the Promotion of the Fine Arts, was held in the rooms of the Literary and Philsophical Society_ and the Museum, Newcastle. During the day, the bazaar was visited by two thousand five hundred persons, who paid for admission, and, if accommodation could have been afforded, it would have been visited by at least a thousand more. There were two stalls in the Museum, the Marchioness of Londonderry attending at one, and the Misses Brandling attending at the other. In the library the stalls were arranged on each side, the centre being left for the promenade. These were attended by Mrs. Mayoress, Mrs J T. Carr, Mrs. Joseph Watson, Mrs. W. L. Harle, Mrs. Barnett, and Mrs. Swinburne. The exhibition of Chinese curiosities, furnished by Captain Coulson, R.N., was highly attractive. The gingalls, cannons, flags, shoes, caps, swords, deities, chairs, bows, arrows, musical instruments, as well as figures, excited much admiration. The total proceeds of the three days amounted to upwards of \u00a3800. A balance of \u00a3530 remained at the disposal of the society. October 6. \u2014 A splendid vessel, the longest ever built on the banks ofthe Wear, was launched from the building yard of Mr. John Watson, at Fallion, near Sunderland. She was built sor Richard Greenwell, esq., and was called '' The Castle Eden,\" in commemoratian of the successful winning of the colliery of that name, of which that gentleman is one of the principal proprietors. October 7. \u2014 Died, at Darlington, Jonathan Backhouse, esq., of Polam House, head of the banking firm of Backhouse & Co., Darlington, aged 63. October 8 \u2014 Saturday, Mr. Henry George Liddell, eldest son of the Hon. H. T. Liddell, M.P., having attained his 21st year, his noble grandfather, Lord Ravensworth, entertained his tenantry at dinner on that day, in celebration of the happy event. It was not, however, until Wednesday, the 12th, that the grand celebration, so long previously determined on, took place. On this latter day between 400 and 500 visitors were present, including Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester, His Imperial Highness the Archduke Frederick Ferdinand of Austria, Lady Caroline Legge, Lord and Lady Chelsea, the Earl of Scarborough, Lord and Lady Barrington and Miss Barrington, Lord and Lady Hardwicke, Lord George Seymour, Lord and Lady Prudhoe, Miss Wynn, and Miss Percy, Sir C. Monck and Mrs. Monck, Matthew Bell, esq., M.P., and Mrs. Bell, Sir Edward and Lady Blackett, and, in, short, most of the principal families in the counties of Durham and Northumber land. For some days past the public mind had been kept in a"], [174, "168 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF. [a.D. 1842. state of considereble excitement, in consequence of the royal and distinguished personages who were expected to be present. The Duchess of Gloucester had come into the north in order to be present at the festivities, and the Duke of Cambridge had also returned, after his recent visit to Wynyard, with the same object. His Royal Highness and the Duchess of Gloucester paid a visit to the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle, and proceeded as far north as Haggerston. The royal duke, after returning to Ravensworth Castle, visited the Marquis and Marchioness of Londonderry, at Wynyard, and proceeded thence to Raby Castle, on a visit to the Duke of Cleveland From Raby his royal highness was expected to return to Ravensworth Castle, first paying a visit to William Russell, esq , of Brancepeth Castle, who had made great preparations for his Royal highness's reception, but he was unexpectedly called to London, and he left Raby Castle for the south. Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester returned from Alnwick Castle on Monday, and on Tuesday she drove out to Lambton Castle, where she remained a short time, and then returned to Ravensworth. The Archduke Frederick of Austria was also in the neighbourhood, and it was hoped would join the festivities \u2014 a hope which it will be seen was realized. The royal and distinguished party began to assemble at Ravensworth Castle shortly after three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, but long before that time the grounds were covered with gay and festive parties, who had determined to enjoy a holiday on the occasion. Indeed, the whole road through the grounds to the castle was crowded by parties anxious to witness the arrival of the company. The grounds, however, appeared decidedly to advantage, the autumnal hues ofthe variegated copse wood contrasting with the green sward of the delightful parks. The preparations at the castle for the reception and entertainment of the company were on an extensive scale. The billiard-room was set apart as an ante-room, where the visitors deposited their hats, cloaks, &c, and then they proceeded to the gallery, where they were received by Lord and Lady Ravensworth, and the different members of the family. The excellent band ofthe 61st Regiment was stationed on the lawn in front of the castle, and a number of choristers were engaged to attend in the gallery, where Mr. Ions presided at the organ. Shortly after the company began to arrive, the band commenced playing. On the entrance of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester, the choristers sang the national anthem, and when His Imperial Highness the Archduke of Austria entered, the grand German national hymn of \" God preserve the Emperor,\" was given in most effective style. During the arrival of the company several beautiful pieces were sung. \" Gloria in Excelsis,\" from Mozart's Twelfth Mass, was finely executed ; and \" Thy Marvellous Works,\" from the sacred oratorio, \" The Creation,\" was sung in most excellent style by Lady Williamson solo, and chorus. The \" Inflammatus,\" from the \" Stabat Mater,\" was also sung by Lady Williamson solo, and"], [175, "A.D. 1842.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 169 chorus ; besides a number of other selections of sacred music, the effect of which was beautiful About half-past five, the company sat down to dinner, which had been set out in the library, saloon, and drawing room and dining room. The royal party dined iu the library, where the tables were laid for about forty. Lord Ravensworth presided, and was supported by the Marquis of Normanby, the Hon. H. T. Liddell, M.P., Lord and Lady Chelsea, Lord and Lady Barrington, Lord Prudhoe, Miss Wynn, and Miss Percy, the Earl of Scarborough, Lord George Seymour, His Impe rial Highness Archduke Frederick of Austria, and suite. Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester, and Lady Caroline Legge, and a number of other distinguished individuals. The gorgeous display of massive silver plate on the principal table had a most magnificent effect ; and the whole of the apartments were set out in a style of princely grandeur. After the cloth had been with drawn, Lord Ravensworth rose and proposed the health of the Queen, which was enthusiastically responded to. The health of Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Queen Dowager, the Duchess of Gloucester, and the rest of the royal family, were also given, and responded to in loud and enthusiastic plaudits. Lord Hardwicke \u2014 who had acted as toastmaster \u2014 then called for a bumper, and the Marquis of Normanby rose to propose the health of the Archduke Ferdinaud of Austria, and in doing so paid a high compliment to his imperial highness. His imperial highness, being unable to speak fluently in English, begged of Lord Ravensworth to acknowledge the compliment which had been paid him, and his lordship did so in happy and appropriate terms. The noble president next proposed the health of Mr. Henry George Liddell, whose majority they were then met to celebrate, and ex pressed his gratification at his having been honoured by the com pany of so many noble and distinguished personages. The toast was drank with great enthusiasm. Mr. H. G. Liddell returned thanks, and concluded by proposing the health of Lord and Lady Ravensworth, which was received with rapturous applause. The Duchess of Gloucester and suite then retired, and the tables were soon deserted for the gallery, which formed a most delightful promenade. The archduke and suite retired to the saloon. The drawing room tables were cleared in a few minutes, and the apart ment converted into a splendid promenade, coffee and tea being served up in the library and dining room. His imperial highness repaired to the gallery about eight o'clock, and the Duchess of Gloucester entered soon afterwards. A quadrille band from New castle had been engaged for the evening. The ball was led off by his imperial highness the archduke and the Hon. Mrs. Liddell. Dancing was kept up with unabated spirit till a late hour. His imperial highness and suite left shortly after ten o'clock, and before twelve all the principal company had taken their departure. Par ties who were present describe the entertainment as having been of the most magnificent description ; while the urbanity and kind ness of Lord and Lady Ravensworth were spoken of in terms of unfeigned admiration. y vol. hi."], [176, "170 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1842. 1842 (October 12/ \u2014 Died, at Albion-place, Newcastle, aged 54, John Trotter Brockets, esq., F.S.A., one ofthe council of the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle, and secretary of the Literary and Philo- sophical Society. Mr. Brockett received his education under the Venerable and Rev. Wm. Turner, then the preceptor of a limited number of young gentlemen, and selected the profession of the law as the object of his pursuit. After the usual course of study, he was admitted au attorney. He practised as such for many years in Newcastle with distinguished ability and success. But his praise as a professional man is, that his practice was marked by the strictest integrity and liberality, and he descended to the tomb amidst the regrets of his numerous friends who reposed with im- plicit confidence their concerns to his guidance and direction. He collected a library of scarce and curious books, which were sold by Mr. Sotheby, in London, in 1823. He also formed a splendid cabinet of coins and medals, which were offered to the public by the same gentleman in that year. For those gems he had the gra- tification of seeing the most gifted men of the day in competition. On the dispersion of his library and museum, he started the pursuit de novo, and he left behind him books, coins, and medals, which may vie with those of any private gentleman in the kingdom. But Mr. Brockett was not a bare collector : he knew the value of his books in the intelligence and wisdom infolded in their pages, and the use of his coins and medals for the purposes of history. Few men indeed studied numismatics with greater closeness or more success than Mr. Brockett, and in this very rare attainment he pre-eminently stood forth. Mr. Brockett, as a writer and editor, is extensively known ; but the works by which he is most distin guished are \u2014 \" Inquiry into the Question whether the Freeholders of Newcastle-upon-Tyne are entitled to vote for Members of Par liament for the County of Northumberland,\" and his \" Glossary of North Country Words.\" The first of these publications received the high commendations of Mr. Hopper Williamson and other con stitutional lawyers ; and the latter is appreciated wherever the English language is known. October 13. \u2014 Lord and Lady Prudhoe arrived at Alnwick Castle, on their nuptial visit to their noble relatives, the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, and their entrance into the town was hailed with the utmost enthusiasm, and accompanied with every demonstration of public rejoicing. The Percy tenantry, to the number of nearly 500, met them at Hampath Bank, near Newton- on-the-Moor, and escorted them to the castle. As they entered the town, they were saluted by the cannon on the castle, the shops were closed during the procession, and, as the noble lord and his bride drove through the town, they graciously acknowledged the greetings with which they were received. The tenantry and other inhabitants of the town were bountifully regaled at the castle. Dinners were provided at the different inns, and the day was kept as an entire holiday in the neighbourhood. Alnwick Castle stands in a spacious area, which at the time of its greatest"], [177, "A.D. 1842.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 171 strength totally surrounded it, defended by a complete circumval lation, with an inner and an outer moat. At present the front is open on the north-east, towards the Battery ; and the wall having towers at proper intervals, shuts it in on the other quarters To the south-east the gardens and pleasure grounds called Bameyside appear beautifully disposed ; and to the south and west the town of Alnwick is seen spreading on the back ground. It seems pretty evident that the Castle owes its origin to the Romans. It is believed to have been founded by them, although no part of the original structure is now remaining. But, some years ago, when part of the Castle Keep was taken dowu to be repaired, under the present walls were discovered the foundations of other buildings, which lay in a different direction from the present, and upon some of the stones appeared Roman mouldings. The Keep of the Castle may have been founded at a later period, probably in the Saxon times. The zigzag fretwork round the arch that leads into the iuuer court is evidently of Saxon architecture ; and yet this was probably not the most ancient entrance ; for under the flag-tower, before that part was altered by the first Duke of Northumberland, there was an appearance of a gateway that had been walled up, directly fronting the present outward gateway into the town. In the third year of the reign of Edward IL, 1309, the Castle and Barony of Alnwick came into the possession of the Percies, a family of great distinction in the County of York from the time of the conquest. Immediately on this acquisition, the Lord Henry de Percy began to repair the Castle ; and he and his successors, afterwards Earls of Northumberland, perfected and completed both this citadel and its outworks. The ruin of this Castle, from its ancient grandeur, may be dated from the time of the destructive orders of Oliver Crom well's parliament. But by the death of Algernon, Duke of Somerset, in 1750, it devolved, together with all the estates of this great Barony, to the first Duke and Duchess of Northumberland. They rescued this ancient castle from the decay in which it mouldered, and restored it to more than its pristine splendour. His Grace repaired the surrounding towers, aud added those that were wanting with a miuute exactness. The citadel was a heap of ruins ; but he retained much of the old walls and restored its original form, still observing the Gothic exterior in every compartment, and uniting it with all the magnificence of the modern ; so that it may deservedly be considered one of the noblest and most superb models of a great baronial castle. The Castle is a noble structure, and built origin ally in the Saxon style, although it has been added to and altered at various periods. On the battlements are numerous effigies, according to the taste of the Normans, in whose time it underwent a principal reparation. These effigies represent warriors in the act of defence, wielding such arms as were then used. Some of them are disposed with great propriety. The building is of freestone, in chiselled work. Its form is singular, being composed of a cluster of semicircular and angular bastions. The Castle properly consists of three courts or divisions, the entrance into which was defended with"], [178, "172 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a D. 1842. three strong massy gates, called the Utter Ward, the Middle Ward, and the Inner Ward. Each of these gates was in a high embattled tower, furnished with a portcullis, and the outward gate with a drawbridge also. They had each of them a porter's lodge, and a strong prison, besides other necessary apartments for the constable, bailiff, and subordinate officers ; and under each of the prisons was a deep and gloomy dungeon, into which prisoners were let down with cords. The only remaining prison is situated on the right of the inner ward, and is entered by a narrow passage about sixteen feet in length. It is eleven feet four inches long and ten feet four inches wide. Beneath this prison, under ground, is the dungeon in all its original horrors. It is nine feet long, eight feet wide, and eleven feet deep, and has no entrance but by a trap door or iron grate, the Gothic emblem of lawless and arbitrary power. The approach to the Castle retains much of the solemn grandeur of former times. Tho moat is drained, and the ceremony of letting down tho drawbridge is discarded, but the walls which inclose the area still wear the countenance of strength and defiance. It is entered from tho town by a machicolated gate, defended by an upper tower, and, after passing a covered way, the interior gate opens to the area. This entrance is defended by all the devices used in ancient times, \u2014 iron-studded gates, portcullis, open galleries, aud apertures in the arching for annoying assailants, with the figures of warriors in stone mounted on the battlements; whilst over the great gateway of the ancient barbican stands the armorial escutcheon of the Percies \u2014 a lion rampart. 1842 ( October 14) \u2014 Died, at Saltwell House, near Gateshead, the residence of William Caley, esq., aged 27, the Rev. John Lewis Eyre of Newcastle. He hud officiated as assistant catholic priest with the Revds. James Worswick and William Riddell for the last sixteen months. In September, he was seized with the prevailing complaint of influenza and fever, of which he died. His remains were privately conveyed to the Catholic Chapel on the night of Tuesday, the 18th, and on Wednesday morning a solemn service was performed over the bod}r, which was enclosed in a leaden coffin, and rested on a bier at the foot of the altar. The chapel was crowded to excess. His remains were afterwards interred at Jesmond Cemetery. October 16. \u2014 Died, at Morpeth, aged 69, William Ord, esq., of Nunnykirk, Northumberland, universally and deservedly respected. The deceased, who was widely known as the owner of the celebrated Beeswing, Tomboy, and other racers, as well as by some little eccen tricities of dress and deportment, was honoured, not only in Great Britain, but on the Continent, for a character which few have acquired \u2014 a honest and honourable sportsman. He was at the great sote at Ravensworth, and promenaded a considerable time on the lawn. He appeared in good spirits, and conversed freely with all around. October 20 \u2014Died, at Bamburgh, aged 25, Grace Horsley Darling, the heroine of the Farn Islands. She had been in a"], [179, "A.D. 1842.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 173 delicate state of health for some time, and her medical attendant recommended her removal from the sea She, in consequence, went to reside with a friend at Wooler, and afterwards removed to Alnwick, where lodgings were engaged for her and her sister by their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, by whom the greatest attention was paid to the amiable girl. Her complaint having assumed the form of decided consumption, and all hope of recovery abandoned, her father anxiously desired that she should return amongst her family, and she was accordingly removed from Alnwick to Bamburgh only about ten days before her death. 1842 (Nov. 9/ \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected mayors and sheriffs : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014Thomas Dunn, esq., mayor, and Joseph Hawks, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 Robert Davies, esq., mayor. Sunderland \u2014 Andrew White, esq., mayor. Stockton\u2014 Charles Trotter, esq., mayor. Morpeth \u2014 William Trotter, esq , M.D. mayor. Berioiclc \u2014 Joseph Hubback, esq., mayor, George Johnson, esq, sheriff. Hartlepool \u2014 Thomas Rowell, esq,, mayor. November 26.\u2014 Lady Peat, widow of the Rev. Sir Robert Peat, the chaplain and companion of George the Fourth, died this day, at her house, in Villiers street, Bishopwearmouth, aged 90. Her eccentricities, as Miss Smith, of East Herrington, and the firing of her house, and murder of her servant girl, by some criminal yet unknown, are, no doubt, familiar to some still living. The fire and murder took place on the 28th of August, 1815, and three men \u2014 Eden, Wolfe, sen., and Wolfe, jun. \u2014 were put on their trial for the offences. The two former were found guilty and sen tenced to he hanged, but were afterwards pardoned, an alibi having been proved to the complete satisfaction of the judges; and a wit ness against them, of the name oi Lincoln, was afterwards tried and found guilty of perjury. November 28. \u2014 Died, at Eggloscliffe, Durham, at the advanced age of 89, the Rev. John Brewster, for sixty-six years a minister of the Church of England, and successively incumbent of Great ham, Stockton, Redmarshall, Boldon, and Egglescliffe, all in the county of Durham. Iu 1759 he published his \" Parochial History and Antiquities of Stockton-upon-Tees,\" a highly esteemed topo graphical work. He had previously published a work \" On the Prevention of Crime, and the Advantages of Solitary Imprison ment,\" in which he enunciated principles greatly in advance of the age The deceased was born in Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, on the 18th of January, 1754, his father being at that time curate of St. Nicholas'. December 13. \u2014 Died, iu Newcastle, aged 76, Archibald Reed, esq., many years an alderman, and six times mayor, of Newcastle. His remains were interred on the 19th in the cemetery at Jesmond, the melancholy procession consisting of a hearse and four mourning coaches, besides a number of private carriages. The funeral was attended by the stewards of the incorporated companies and a great number of individuals anxious to show their respect to the"], [180, "174 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1843. deceased. In politics Mr. Reed was a Conservative ; and all acknowledged his amiable disposition, kindness of heart, and liberal hospitality. Indeed, few individuals have been so fortunate in securing the esteem of their fellow-townsmen, or have departed this life more deeply and deservedly regretted. 1843 (January 13/ \u2014 A tremendous storm of wind passed over this country, and inflicted serious damage. Tn Northumberland and Durham the injury effected by the storm was much less severe than in the southern countries, but several vessels were wrecked upon the coast. At Tynemouth two ships went to pieces on the rocks, and Captain Hair, of the Percy, with two of his crew, were drowned. January 31 . \u2014 As Robert Owen, the well-known Socialist, was lec turing in the Lecture Room, Newcastle, au Irishman attempted to reply to the statements of the lecturer. He was, however, ejected, upon which he collected a number of his countrymen, who com menced an attack upon the doors of the building with sticks, broken bed-posts, cbair legs, &c. In a short time they forced an entrance, and soon compelled the audience to retreat through the doors and windows. The Irishmen were satisfied with this victory, and did not commit any serious personal injury. February 2. \u2014 A man named Chapman, who was committed to Newcastle Gaol for trial, contrived to escape from that building. After scaling the wall of the prisoners' yard, he fastened two short ladders together with some rope used for drying clothes, by which he reached the top of the outer wall. He then lowered himself down with the remainder of the rope and escaped. Five others, who attempted to perform the same daring feat, were captured in the garden. February 3. \u2014 A tremendous storm of wind arose this evening, and continued during the night, doing great damage. A stack of chimneys was blown through the roof of Mr. Elliott's house in Eldon-street, Newcastle, doing considerable damage to the furni ture. The houses of Mr. Penman, Percy-street, Mr. G. Hodgson, Forth, and Mr. Dixon, Blandford-street, were partially unroofed. At Arthur's Hill, in Edward-street, a chimney, belonging to the house of Mr. Holmes, was blown down, and the materials broke through the roof, and buried Mrs. Holmes \u2014 who was sitting at breakfast \u2014 in the ruins. Two of her ribs were broken, and she was otherwise much bruised. At South Shields, in King-street, a woman named Bell was killed by the falling of a signboard ; and a chapel in Cuthbert-street was almost totally destroyed. At Brock ley Whins the extensive wooden sheds of the Brandling Junction Railway were completely carried away by the violence of the wind. In Dockwray-square, North Shields, a chimney fell through the roof of the house of Henry Dale, esq., causing the utmost alarm and confusion. The shops were closed until near twelve o'clock, and the streets were deserted from dread of the falling missiles. At Spital Tongues the end of a house was completely blown in ; and a house in Church-street, Gate, head, was levelled with the"], [181, "A.D. 1843.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 175 ground. The destruction of trees throughout the country was exceedingly great, several hundreds being uprooted in Hulne Park, Alnwick, alone. Indeed, every town and village in the two counties suffered more or less during the gale. Two vessels, the Rob Roy and the Blucher, were blown on shore at Newbiggen, and every soul on board of them perished. The fishermen's boats at Hauxby were completely destroyed, and much damage was done to shipping all along the coast. 1843 (February 6/ \u2014 The fiftieth anniversary of the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Suciety was celebrated by a dinner in the Assembly Rooms. Dr. Headlam presided, and Mr. J. Clayton and Mr. J. Adamson officiated as vice-chairmen. February 13. \u2014 A silver snuff-box, containing three pounds ten shillings, was presented to William Wheeler by the members of the North Shields District of Oddfellows, in testimony of then appreciation of his heroic conduct in rescuing four seamen wrecked in the brig Percy on Tynemouth Rocks. Wheeler also received presents from several Courts of Foresters. February 13. \u2014 An extraordinary case of dropsy of the uterus presented itself in a cow, the property of Mr. Hopps, Bent House, near Durham. This day the animal was operated upon by Mr. C. J. Hubbick, veterinary surgeon, when water to the amount of 28 gallons was taken from her. February 18. \u2014 Died, at South Shields, aged 104, Mrs. Sarah Parkenson. February 21. \u2014 William Russell, esq., of Brancepeth Castle, gave a splendid entertainment to the nobility and gentry of that neighbourhood. There was a dinner party, to which 170 sat down, after which there was a grand fancy dress ball. The ball was opened with a quadrille costumee, composed of eight couple, in the national dresses of as many different countries, which had a very imposing effect. February 28. \u2014Married, at Shrivenham, the Hon. Thomas Liddell, second son of Lord Ravensworth, to Caroline, daughter of the fifth Viscount Barrington. March 10. \u2014 A melancholy case of stabbing occurred in the neighbourhood of Rothbury, which occasioned the death of William Weatherstone, of Forest Burn Bar. The deceased, in company with George Hindhaugh, of Coldside ; George Brown, of Ward's Hill ; James Gibson, of Hesleyhirst ; and Thomas Arkle, of Crook, all tenants of the Duke of Northumberland, left Rothbury on their return home, having previously indulged rather freely in certain fluids. On arriving at a place called Garby Bank, about a mile and a half from Rothbury, Weatherstone and Hindhaugh commenced fighting. After a few blows had been exchanged, Hindhaugh was seen by Brown to draw a knife and strike Weatherstone in the thigh, who immediately fell. Brown then interferred, and lifted the deceased, who was bleeding from a fearful wound in the groin. Whilst he was in the act of doing"], [182, "176 [a.d. 1483. HISTORICAL REGISTER OF this, Hindhaugh, who had gone forward a few yards, returned, and cut Brown severely in the thigh. Weatherstone almost imme diately expired from loss of blood. Hindhaugh was tried at the ensuing assizes, and sentenced to seven years' transportation. 1843 (April 5). \u2014 An explosion of fire-damp took placo at Stor mont Main Colliery, Wreckenton, near Gateshead, the property of J. Grace, esq , and partners, by which twenty-seven men and boys lost their lives. It appeared that there had been much foul air in the pit for some days previous, and the men had been advised to use extreme care. A subscription was entered into for the widows and children left destitute by the calamity, and a consider able sum raised for their support. April 7. \u2014 The following remarkable occurrence, in which a steamer was stolen and afterwards wrecked \u2014 attended with loss of life \u2014 took place at Tynemouth, near North Shields. At daybreak, some pilots, on the look-out at the entrance of the river, discovered a vessel amongst the rocks called the Black Middens, which proved to bo the Charles Williams steamer, belonging to Messrs. Richardson and Co., coal mei chants, South Shields. The alarm was instantly raised, and the life-boat was manned, when, before arriving alongside, much surprise was evinced at finding only one man on board, who was safely taken out of the wreck and conveyed ashore. Immediately on landing he attempted to go away without giving any account as to the manner in which the steamer was wrecked, but the Customs officer detained him, and after being in custody some time, he admitted having, with another man, stolen the steamer from her moorings in the Tyne. The other man, he said, jumped overboard to swim to the rocks, but he suspected he had been drowned, for he saw nothing more of him. The man supposed to be drowned was a discarded son of the owner of the boat. April 12. \u2014 A commission de lunatico inquirendo, under the authority of the great seal, was opened at Alnwick, for the purpose of inquiring into the state of mind of Miss Elizabeth Gallon. The cause created great interest, and, after a protracted investigation, which lasted five days, the jury returned their verdict \u2014 \" That Miss Gallon was of unsound mind, and had beeii so since January the lst, 1812.\" The lady was 75 years of age, and possessed of considerable property. April 20. \u2014 Married, at Chester-le-Street, Henry, eldest son of Sir John Fife, of Newcastle, to Lucy, eldest daughter of John Cookson, esq., of Whitehill, Durham. Great rejoicing took place at Chester-le-Street on the occasion ; banners were hung from almost every house in the town, and nearly 2,000 of the inhabitants joined in the marriage procession. April 22. \u2014 Hexham and its neighbourhood were visited by a thunderstorm of considerable violence. A farm-house, at Grind ridge, about four miles from Hexham, occupied by Mr. Walter Dodd, was struck by the electric fluid, which destroyed the furni ture and window frames, the house being also much shattered and"], [183, "A.D. 1843.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 177 left almost in ruins. The family escaped unhurt. A goose, which was sitting upon some eggs in the back kitchen, had the eggs and the nest entirely destroyed, but was itself uninjured. 1843 (April 24/ \u2014 This morning, it was discovered that a sailor, named William Ferry, residing on the Quayside, Monkwearmouth, had murdered his wise, Hannah Ferry, and daughter, aged 14 years. The unfortunate man had been sor some time confined in a lunatic asylum at Gateshead Fell, but bad escaped two days previous to the occurrence. May 3. \u2014 This afternoon, a Scotchman, of the name of Robert Crombier, precipitated himself into the Tyne from the topsail yard of a vessel lying opposite the Custom House. The height was about 80 feet. This daring seat was accomplished without any injury being sustained, and was repeated on the following day. May 13, a similar feat was accomplished in Shields Harbour by a Scotch seaman, named James Soulsby, who smoked a pipe throughout the performance. May 25. \u2014 Died, suddenly, at his residence, Hengate, Darling ton, aged 38, C. Wetheral, esq., solicitor. He weighed 33 stones when thirty years of age, and his coffin, which was 7 feet 6 inches long, 2 feet 5 inches deep, and 3 feet 2 inches across the breast, weighed, with the body, fifty-eight stones. Before this immense burthen could be removed for interment it was necessary to take out a large bow window in the deceased's house. June 26. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Ramsay's br h Moss- trooper. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Cuthbert's br f Queen of the Tyne. July 1. \u2014 A fire of a most alarming description broke out near midnight in the extensive raff-yard of Messrs. R. Todd and Company, in Pandon, Newcastle. Vast crowds from all quarters, in and around Newcastle, came rushing towards the blazing mass. People from the market-places, from the busy streets, full of their Saturday evening throng, from the theatre, from the \" shows,\" and, more than all, from the public-houses and taprooms, hurried, in the wildest consternation, in the direction of the flames. The timber-yard is the lowest point of a large extent of ground, and surrounding it, in almost every direction, are considerable heights, standing on which a full view could be obtained of all that was going on below \u2014 the wild ocean of fire heaving and roaring as if no human effort could ever stay its fury \u2014 while a brightness like that of noonday lay on the houses and the whole wide space around it. Eight houses in New Pandon-street were also set on fire by the intense heat, and completely gutted, and the destruction of the whole of that street appeared so probable, that it was deter mined to pull down a house in order to arrest the progress of the flames, when, fortunately, the wind changed, and further danger was averted. Between twelve and one o'clock was the time when the fire might be said to have been at the worst, and its strength was not much spent till past two. About the former period the VOL. III. z"], [184, "178 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1843. spectacle presented was terribly beautiful ; the brilliancy of the flames, the reflection of which was seen in every direction for twenty miles, exceeded that of any previous fire in Newcastle ; and the singular scene presented by the many thousands of spectators assembled as in an amphitheatre on the heights which surround the spot, had a most remarkable effect. Eight public and private fire engines were on the spot at an early period, but it was not until four o'clock that the fire was subdued. No less than ninety-nine persons were rendered nearly destitute by the loss of their clothing and furniture in this sad catastrophe. It was, indeed, a most lamentable sight to see the poor people rushing out of their houses in New Pandon-street and along Pandon-bank \u2014 half-naked children, turned out of their beds, and screaming in the wildest terror, and their hastily-dressed and scarcely less affrighted mothers running and crying in every direction, while the men, nearly as much confused, ran about trying in the best manner they could to save their little property. The premises had been used as a timber yard for 150 years, aud their contents at the time of the fire were valued at \u00a32,000. Tbe total damage was estimated at \u00a312,000. Mr. Pringle, the chief clerk of the establishment, was a very great sufferer, inasmuch as himself and sisters lost all they possessed. On the fire being discovered they had to leave their house, in order to save their lives, without the necessary clothing. Mr. Pringle enjoyed the respect and confidence of his employer, and was generally esteemed. He had been in the establishment for 29 years, and his father was a servant in the same office for the long period of 50 years. A public meeting was held, and the sum of \u00a3387 was subscribed for the relief of the sufferers. 1843 (July 7 ). \u2014 Died, at his house in Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, the Rev. James Worswick, aged 73, for sorty-ei^ht years minister of the Roman Catholic Chapel in that town. He was the son of an eminent banker at Lancaster, but prefering to labour for others rather than aggrandize himself, he renounced the means of accumulating wealth, and made choice of the priesthood, that he might spend his life in the service of his church. His liberal expenditure amongst the poor, extensive acquirements, and pre possessing manners, made him beloved and respected by all who knew him. July 13, his interment took place in the then unfinished church in Clayton-street, and was attended by many thousands of persons, who walked in procession from Pilgrim street to the place of sepulture. July 12. \u2014 The i!7tb Regiment of Infantry, stationed at Newcastle Barracks, was reviewed on the Town Moor by Sir A. Duff, general of the district, who was accompanied by Lieutenant- Colonel Higgins and a splendid staff. After the review the regiment formed into square, in the centre of which were the General, Colonel Sir J. M. Wallace, Lieutenant-Colonel Bradshaw the Mayor, &c, &c, and new colours having been consecrated by the Rev. W. Dodd, they were presented to the regiment by the general in an appropriate address. The regiment was raised in"], [185, "A.D. 1843.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 179 1702, and embarked for Holland 1703, and joined the Duke of Marlborough's army ; fought at the battle of Schnotterbugh on the 2nd of July, 1704, and also at the battle of Blenheim on the 13th of August, 1704 ; served at the memorable battle of Ramillies, 23rd May, 1706; formed part of the landing brigade at the battle of Oudernard, Ilth July, 1708, and who particularly distinguished themselves on that eventful occasion ; were engaged at the siege of Tournay, in 1 709 ; and at the sanguinary battle of Malpiagnet, lithos September, 1709; formed part of the expedition against Lubec, in 1711 ; served in Flanders in 1712, under the Duke of Ormond ; were at the battle of Dettingen, 1743, under King George the Second and the Earl of Stair ; were at the battle of Fontenoy, in 1745 ; highly distinguished themselves at the battle of Minden, lst August, 1759, and, in consequence, had the word Minden inscribed ou their colours ; were at the battle of Kirsch Denkern, 15th July, 1761; were at the battle of Grabenstein in 1762; were at the capture of Lond Island, in America, in 1777; served in North America during the whole of the war, and after the peace in 1783; afterwards embarked for Plolland, 1793; served under the Duke of York, 1793 and 1794; were at the battle of Minora, 17th and 18th May, 1794 ; highly distinguished themselves in an action fought near Tournay, on the 22nd of May, 1794; and, in consequence, had the word Tournay inscribed on the colours ; in short, all throughout the Peninsula War, and even up to this time, the 37th Regiment has uniformly distinguished itself in a very exemplary manner. 1843 (July 20). \u2014 This afternoon, at three o'clock, the Martello, Hull and Leith Steam Packet Company's steamer, arrived at the Granton Pier, bringing the sad tidings of the total loss of the Pegasus, Hull steamer, belonging to the same company. It appears the vessel struck on the Goldstone Rock, near the Fame Islands, and not far distant from the spot where the Forfarshire experienced a similar fate about six years previously (see page 97). The sud den shock experienced, at a time when every one on board, from the calmness of the evening and the smoothness of the sea, felt the most perfect security, at once made them alive to the imminence of the danger. The boats were immediately lowered, but were soon swamped by the crowd of persons who rushed into them. About five o'clock a.m., the Martello descried the wreck, and succeeded in saving six persons, the only survivors, who were floating about on pieces of timber, &c, much exhausted. At the time of the accident there were twenty-three steerage and eighteen cabin pas sengers, besides a crew of fourteen men, in the ill-fated vessel, consequently forty-nine persons lost their lives. A Mr. Baillie, one of the passengers saved, stated that, previous to the foundering of the vessel, Mr. Mackenzie, a minister, called on those around him to engage in prayer, which we all did most heartily. One lady was standing near me at the time with two children, I heard her calmly resign her soul to the Almighty, while her two little children, about four years of age, were prattling together, evidently ignorant of"], [186, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1843. 180 any danger. I could stand this scene no longer, the ship was just sinking, so I sprang into the sea. Mr. Erown, the mate, stated that he was drawn under the water with the suction of the ship, and when he rose again he saw the master swimmiug. The sea, at this time, was covered with the sufferers in their last mental agony, contending with the waves, and he described the scene as most fear ful, shrieks and prayers were heard on every side, and ever and anon some wretched sufferer disappeared, and was swallowed up in the gr. at inexorable. The Pegasus was quite out of her track, but from what cause was not ascertained. 1843 (August 7). \u2014 The long talked of Tyne Regatta took place at the Low Lights, North Shields, and the weather being fine, the sports drew together au immense concourse of spectators. Mr. Joseph Straker was commodore, and Mr. Thomas Harbutt conductor. The amusements concluded on the 8th, by a ball at the Golden Lien Inn, South Shields, which was led off by Mrs. Eddowes and R. Ingham, esq. August 19. \u2014 A piece of very handsome plate, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, Newcastle, was presented to Mr. Thomas Teasdale, by the miners, workmen, and friends of the Silver Tongue Mine Adventure, at Greenhead, Derwent. August 24. \u2014 The tide was so low at the mouth of the Tyne that a pilot, named Robert Young, waded across the Bar, from the north to the south side. Another very low tide occurred September 6th, 1846, when three pilots walked across the river, from the north to the south side. See Sykes, August 2Qth, 1824. October 10. \u2014 Died, at Wallsend, in the county of Northum berland, in the 70th year of his age, John Buddie, esq. The deceased was born at Kyo, near Tanfield, Durham, his father being then the schoolmaster at that place, though ultimately the manager of the celebrated Wallsend Colliery, a situation in which his son succeeded him in 1806. As a mining engineer and colliery manager, Mr. Buddie had long stood in the front rank of his profession, and the extensive and varied scientific knowledge which he possessed, and the almost unrivalled skill and judgment with which he applied that knowledge to actual practice, procured for him the highest professional reputation, not only in this country, but abroad. His sterling honesty and unaffected kindness ot heart caused him to be loved and respected by his friends, and the liberality with which he privately bestowed large sums in acts of charity will be long and gratefully remembred by those numerous individuals who were the objects of his unostentatious benevolence. Mr. Buddie left a fortune of not less than \u00a3150,000, as a monu ment of his skill and enterprise. October 16th, the remains of the deceased were interred at Benwell. Sixty gentlemen on horseback preceded the hearse, which was followed by nine mourning coaches, upwards as sixty private carriages, and a great number of workmen rom various collieries. October 21. \u2014 The pitmen of Northumberland and Durham held a meeting at Shadon Hill, for the purpose of presenting"], [187, "A.D. 1843.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 181 Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, esq., M.P., with an address expressive of their high admiration ot his zealous and unwearied advocacy of the interests of the people. At least 25,000 persons were present on the occasion. 1843 (October 27/ \u2014 This morning, one of the boilers attached to the Spital Tongues Colliery exploded, when the engineman was thrown a considerable distance, and shortly afterwards expired. November 3. \u2014 Three massive doors were completed in New castle for the York Minister, and sent off this day. The three were alike, and measured sixteen feet in height and six and a half feet in breath. They were executed by Mr. James Wallace, builder, and Mr. R. S. Scott, carver, both of Newcastle, and their elegant workmanship was admired by all who saw them. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected chief magistrates of the boroughs in Northumberland and Durham : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Sir John Fife ; William Cookson, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 William Kenmir, esq. Sunderland \u2014 Robert Burdon Cay, esq. Durham \u2014 Robert Henry Allan, esq. Stockton \u2014 Charles Trotter, esq. Morpeth \u2014 Robert Hawdon, esq, Berwick \u2014 Patrick Clay, esq. ; George Johnson, esq., sheriff, November 21. \u2014 One of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway omnibusses was standing at the station, having three inside passengers, the driver being absent. All at once the horses bolted off and galloped along Marlborough-street, Clayton-street, Market street, and Grey-street, taking all the turns with care, and, although it is well-known that the entrance to the yard of the Turk's Head is so narrow as to require cautious driving to take in a carriage, yet the horses at full speed entered the yard, and made a full stop at the stable door, without doing any material injury. It appears they took a wide sweep, so as to bring the carriage almost parallel with the yard, before entering. November 23, \u2014 Died, at Wingates, near Morpeth, Mr. Thomas Hume, aged 87. The deceased and his forefathers had been tenants upon the same farm sor 439 years, an ancestor having held it in 1411, when the estate was purchased by Roger de Thornton. December 7. \u2014 The members and other friends of the Master Mariners' Asylum, at South Shields, assembled at the Seamen's Hall. R. Anderson, esq, in the chair, and after the statement of their accounts were read, they walked in procession, preceded by a band of music, amidst a large concourse of spectators, to an eminence near the sea, where the foundation-stone of the asylum was laid by Mr. Anderson. The site, more than an acre, was presented by R. Ingham, esq., and Dr. Winterbottom supplied the society with funds for building sour cottages. A collation was provided for the Master Mariners' Society and their friends in the Seamen's Hall, Fowler-street, to which the party returned after the ceremony. In 1846, seventeen additional cottages had been built at the expense of Dr. Winterbotton, who has long been a munificent friend to all the institutions in the neighbourhood. Matthew Popplewell, esq., also became a liberal subscriber to the society."], [188, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1814. 182 1843 (December 27/\u2014 The brethren of the St. Hilda Lodge, No. 292, of Free and Accepted Masons, South Shields, held their anniver sary festival, in their lodge room, at Brother Towers', Golden Lion Hotel, King-street, when the following officers were duly installed for the ensuing year ; T. B. Oyston, esq., W.M. ; R. Anderson, esq., S.W. ; R. Gregory, esq., J.W. ; K. M. Kelly, esq., treasurer; J. Cummins, secretary; G. D. Hall, S.D. ; W. Ripon, J.D.; J. Marshall, J.G. ; W. Preston, S.S. ; H. Hewison, J.S. ; and J. Fancor, tyler. The ceremonies of the day being concluded, a numerous company sat down to an excellent dinner and wines of the best quality. 1844 (January 23/ \u2014 As William Thompson, a man in the employment of Mr. Thomas Muers, of Warkworth Mills, was proceeding home, he was attacked by three men, who were secreted in the wood nearly opposite the Hermitage. It being exceedingly dark he could not identify the party, but set to work in earnest to defend himself and succeeded in pitching one of them into the river Coquet. The other two took to their heels shouting for Thompson to take their companion out of the water or he would be drowned. Thompson, with the assistance of a branch, dragged the almost drowned man ashore, when it turned out to be a young man of the name of Smailes, who had, with another youth named Wear, been pursuaded to the spot by a notorious fellow of the name of Thomas Wake, who had been the terror of the neighbourhood for some time. January 27. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, Mr. Joseph Welch. The deceased constructed the Grey Column, in Newcastle, the Ouseburn Viaduct, the BeUingham Bridge on the Tyne, &c. His death was owing to injuries sustained from a gig accident. January 29. \u2014 This evening, a fire broke out in the stack-yard of Mr. Lockey, near Swalwell, by which eleven stacks of grain were destroyed. The fire had evidently been the work of an incendiary, and, at the ensuing Summer Assizes, a person named Oxley was transported for life for the offence. February 16. \u2014 Died, at Heworth, Durham, in his 88th year, much and deservedly respected, Anthony Easterby, esq. He was the oldest merchant and trader in the town of Newcastle, and was, together with his late partner, Mr. George Doubleday, the means of commencing some of those branches of manufacture that have since been carried to so great an extent on the Tyne. On the passing of the Municipal Reform Bill, in 1835, Mr. Easterby was elected a member of the Town Council, and subsequently an alderman and a magistrate for the town and county of Newcastle, which offices, after holding them sor a few years, increasing age and infirmity caused him to resign. March 14. \u2014 A murder of a most revolting character was perpetrated in Blandford-street, Newcastle, by an Irishman, named Mark Sherwood, on the body of Ann Sherwood, his wife. The parties occupied two underground rooms in Blandford-street, and the evil of poverty in condition was aggravated by the dissolute"], [189, "A.D. 1844.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 183 habits of Sherwood. It appeared that he had been a soldier in the Artillery, and enjoyed a small pension ; and having thus frequent means of gratifying his propensity, there was little domestic peace. The parties were heard quarelling on the previous day, and the woman then used language which would aggravate the most placid and least jealous of husbands. This morning, suspicion being excited by the silence which prevailed in their apartments, Ann Sutherland, niece of the murdered woman, borrowed a key of Walter Ormston, who lived in an adjoining house, with which she succeeded in obtaining an entrance, when the woman was sound lying dead upon the floor, her head nearly severed from her body, and beside her lay Sherwood, also apparently dead, but in reality only insensible from the effects of whiskey. Terrified as she was, Sutherland managed to alarm the neighbours. Information was communicated to Inspector Little, at the Westgate Police-station, and in a very short space of time police were on the spot, almost directly followed by Messrs, Carr and Taylor, surgeons. Ann Sherwood, the wife, on examination, presented an appearance truly horrifying. In her throat were two deep and frightful gashes, from which blood had necessarily flowed in profusion. Two other dreadful wounds were in the left jaw. These had apparently been inflicted in the midst of a struggle, for that there had been a struggle was proved by the cuts and blood which were on the hands, the thumb of one of which was nearly severed. Attention was next turned to Sherwood himself. He was still alive, but in a state of drunken stupefaction so complete, and in such a scene so shocking, that death seemed for a time to have the mastery. The stomach-pump was applied with vigour, and drew off an almost incredible quantity of whisky. On the suggestion of Dr. White mustard blisters were applied to his legs and feet, and this application was followed by immediate good results. At the Summer Assizes, before Chief Baron Pollock, Sherwood was tried and convicted of the murder, and sentenced to be executed, but certain circumstances in the case led several influential persons in the town and neighbourhood to petition for a commutation of the sentence to transportation for life. Their applications, however, were not successful, and the execution took place on the Town Moor on the 28rd August following. On examining the premises the police found in the adjoining room a still, with every apparatus necessary for the illicit manufacture of spirit. 1844 (March 18).- \u2014 An incendiary fire occurred in the stack-yard of Mr. George Dodds, at Coxlodge, near Newcastle, when the whole of the stacks were destroyed. Another attempt to set fire to the farm buildings was made on the 27th, but without effect. A reward of \u00a3200 was offered for the discovery of the perpetrators. April 5. \u2014 The bonds by which the Northumberland and Durham pitmen were engaged to their employers expired this day, and the men, generally, refused to renew them. On the 8th, a meeting, held at Black Fell, was attended by upwards of 30,000"], [190, "184 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1844. pitmen, and it was then determined to adhere to the terms offered to, but refused by, the masters. One of the most singular conditions demanded by the men was, that they should be secured work yielding 15s. for every week throughout the year, but that they should not, on any account, be required to work for more than 3s. per day. This self-imposed restriction, they supposed, would equalize the demand for labour throughout the district, and prevent, in future, any portion of their body from being thrown out of employment. According to a return published at the time, the following were the numbers of men employed in the several districts, nearly all of whom \"struck\": \u2014 the Tyne, 15,556; Blyth, 1,031 ; the Wear, 13,172 ; the Tees, 4,211 ; Total 33,970. This disastrous \" strike\" continued during five months, and caused great and general depression in the trade of the town and neigh bourhood. The colliers finally resumed employment without obtaining the objects for which the \" strike\" was commenced. The loss to the district was estimated at upwards of half a million sterling, 1844 (Apjtil 11/ \u2014 Died, at Berwick, at the extraordinary age of 119 years, James Stewart, better known in the neighbourhood as Jamie Strength. The deceased was born in America, but arrived in England at an early age, and was present at the battle of Prestons Pans. Shortly alter he enlisted in a Highland regiment, and was at the capture of Quebec by General Wolfe. He afterwards entered the navy, and was with Rodney in his great victory over the Comte de Grasse. After obtaining his discharge he came to Berwick, and continued ever after to reside in the neighbourhood, supporting himself by his fiddle and by exhibiting feats of almost supernatural strength. He had had five wives and twenty-seven children, several of whom died in the service of their country. His death was caused by a fall, which severely injured his vertebra. A])ril 13. \u2014 As Humble Lamb, esq., a highly-respected magis trate of Northumberland and Durham, was walking in Pilgrim street, Newcastle, he was suddenly attacked with a fit of apoplexy, and died instantaneously.

April. \u2014 Sixty years ago a pair of bluecaps built their nest in a large stone bottle, which had been left to drain between the lower boughs of a fruit tree in the garden of Mr. Callinder, farmer, near Stockton. Every year since that period a pair of bluecaps have regularly built a nest and reared their progeny in the same bottle, and during this month the little creatures were again busily employed in constructing a nest in their old domicile. April \u2014 About the end of this month the \" Scotsman\", an Edinburgh newspaper, stated that a large vessel was then loading coal at Leith for Newcastle, in consequence of the pitmen's strike, and \"duff,\" very small coal, which had hitherto been nearly worthless, rose to a high price."], [191, "A.D. 1844.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 185 1844 (May 22/ \u2014 Died, at Birling, near Warkworth, aged 82, Henry Cramlington, esq., the last of an ancient Northumberland family. Mr. Cramlington was three times mayor of Newcastle. May 27. \u2014 The annual Oddfellows' procession took place in Newcastle, with the usual display of banners and paraphernalia, and was attended by deputies from nearly every town in the kingdom. James Mansfield, esq., Grand Master, presided at the meeting held in the Spital. The order was stated to have 240,000 members, with an anuual income of \u00a3270,000. On the 28th the Music Hall was comfortably filled by members of the order, who sat down to a substantial supper. Sir John Fife, the mayor, presided, with George Crawshay, esq, Gateshead, as vice chairman. May. \u2014 During this month, the Emperor of Russia presented to John Thomas Carr, esq , Russian Vice- Consul for this port, another splendid ring, as an acknowledgment for his activity and skill in superintending the building of vessels in this country. The ring is of a most superb and costly description, being very large, and composed principally of diamonds, several of which are of great size and brilliance. Iu the centre is the imperial N, set on blue enamel. June 12 \u2014 Mr. Belaney, a surgeon, who had for some time resided at North Sunderland, and who was well known in the North of England in connection with the revival of falconry as an amusement, was this day taken into custody, in London, under suspicion of having poisoned his wife, a young and lovely woman, of very respectful connections. This suspicion was intensified by the fact that Mrs. Belaney's mother, Mrs. Skelly, died very suddenly a few months before, whilst residing with Belaney, at North Sunderland, and that Mrs. Skelly 's property, which was considerable, then passed to her daughter. Belaney stated that he had been in the habit of taking prussic acid for some peculiar derangement of the stomach, that in taking a dose he had broken the bottle containing it, and had, in consequence, poured a portion of the liquid into a tumbler in his bed-room, and that his wife, in his absence in search of another bottle, had poured water into the glass and drunk of the contents. The most suspicious circum stances against him were that he had written letters to his friends in the North, informing them that Mrs. Belaney had been taken suddenly and seriously ill, and that she was not expected to recover, when, in fact, she was in her usual health ; and these communications were followed by others stating that Mrs. Belaney could not survive the night, and that she was attended by three of the first medical men in London, when, at the same time, she must have been dead for hours, A Captain Clark, when questioned by one of the jurors at the inquest as to his opinion of the matter, said that the silence which Mr. Belaney preserved up to the Monday night with respect to the prussic acid would have tended to excite his suspicions, did he not know that gentleman to be most kind and humane, as he had seen him mourn with unaffected grief, VOL.

He thought it impossible, and contrary to human nature, that one so kind and good could wilfully administer poison to a wife so kind and gentle, and to whom he appeared so deeply attached. Captain Clark wept as he bore this testimony to the disposition of his friend. The coroner's verdict resulted in a verdict of wilful murder, but, at the conclusion of the trial, August 22nd, a verdict of not guilty was returned. The public feeling in North Sunderland, to which Mr. Belaney returned after the trial, was evinced in the most marked and emphatic manner. On September the 16th, a great crowd of persons, carrying an effigy, assembled in front of his house. This annoyed him so much that he fired a pistol amongst them, and then made his escape by the back of the premises. The result was the total destruction of his house and furniture, the mob having sacked the house, broken up the furniture, and then set fire to the whole. 1844 (June 18/ \u2014 This day will henceforth be a day doubly memorable. Long associated with one of the most brilliant triumphs of British arms and courage, it will now be remembered as the anniversary of the more praiseworthy success of skill and industry. The Newcastle and Darlington Railway, the last link in the railway communication between London and Newcastle, was this day opened to the public. At nine o'clock in the morning three trains, each containing six carriages, started from the Brandling Junction, at Gateshead, and arrived at Darlington at twenty minutes past eleven. At twenty minutes to one an imposing train of twenty-one carriages arrived at York with Mr. Hudson and a numerous party of directors and shareholders. Almost immediately afterwards several of the directors of the London and Birmingham line, the Hon. H. T. Liddell, M.P., and other influential gentlemen, reached the station in a special train from London, having left Euston-square about five o'clock the same morning. An hour and a quarter were consumed by stoppages, so that the whole distance was actually accomplished in six hours and forty-five minutes. The party brought down several copies of the \" Morning Herald,\" containing an important debate in the House of Commons, which had concluded at half-past one o'clock the same morning. One immense train was then formed, headed by three powerful engines, and, at one o'clock, the proces sion moved towards Newcastle, and arrived at Gateshead at twenty-four minutes past two in the afternoon, amidst the firing of cannon and the greeting of assembled thousands, The route was over 83 miles of the London and Birmingham Railway, to Rugby ; 49\u00a3 miles of the Midland Counties Railway, to Derby ; 634 miles of the North Midland Railway, to Normanton ; 23| miles of the York and North Midland Railway, to York ; 45 miles of the Great North of England Railway, to Darlington; 27\u00a3 miles of the Newcastle and Darlington Railway, to Washington ; 5\\ miles of Pontop and South Shields Railway, to Brockley Whins ; and 6 \\ miles of the Brandling Junction Railway, to Gateshead.

The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. H. Johnstone's br c The Era (Lye) ; Best of Three, second ; Bay Momus, third, and Queen of the Tyne, fourth. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. M. Bell's b m Alice Hawthorne (Templeman), beating Mr. J. Bell's ch c Winesour. June 26. \u2014 At the time that the horses were gathering for the Northumberland Plate a most frightful accident took place, by which the limbs of several individuals were fractured. A wooden stand, near the winning chair, gave way whilst crowded^ with spectators, when a dreadful scene of confusion followed. It would be impossible to give anything like a correct account of the numerous bruises and fractures received. The following are a few of the sufferers that were conveyed to the Infirmary, and instantly attended to by Dr. Taylor, the house surgeon . \u2014 Mr. George Oliver, agent, New Bridge-street, Newcastle, had his thigh bone broken ; William Ballance, Blaydon, had his leg broken ; John Hall, Lisle-street, Newcastle, had his right arm and left leg broken ; Henry Stephenson, Manor-chare, Newcastle, had his left leg broken ; Thomas Hodgson, Albion-street, New castle, had his right leg broken ; William Rowell, Thornton-street, Newcastle, had his right leg broken, and Thomas Lowthin, Gallowgate, Newcastle, had his right eye knocked out.

August 28. \u2014 The Earl of Zetland, Grand Master of the Free masons of England, laid the foundation-stone of a monument to the late Earl of Durham, on Pensher Hill, with great ceremony. The attendance of spectators was immense, at least 30,000 being present. The monument is of the Grecian order of architecture, and, in design, is an approximation to the Temple of Theseus. It is 100 feet long by 53 wide, the height being about 70 feet. September 10. \u2014 The Queen and royal family sailed past the Durham and Northumberland coasts, on their way to Scotland, and the royal squadron was distinctly observed by crowds of spectators. The passage from London to Tynemouth (320 miles) was accomplished in twenty-nine hours, the quickest passage then recorded."], [194, "188 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1844 1844 (September 28/ \u2014 An appalling explosion of fire-damp occurred at Haswell Colliery, in the county of Durham, this day, when ninety-five human beings were deprived of life. The explosion took place in the Hutton seam, almost immediately after a fall of stone from the roof which had liberated a vast quantity of gas. The number of men and boys usually employed in this part of the pit is about one hundred, and, when the explosion took place, there were ninety-nine down. The other four would also, without doubt, have perished had not the course of the explosive current been intercepted by some waggons laden with coals. Thirty-five of the men were married, and many of them left large families. On the 30th, 60 of the bodies were removed to South Hetton, and, in the church-yard of that village, consigned to the grave. On the following day, several others of the sufferers were interred at Easington and other villages. The pit \u2014 the property of Messrs. Plummer, Taylor, & Co. \u2014 had been seven years at work, and was considered a very safe one. Humanity immediately suggested the commencement of a subscription for the relief of the sufferers, and the sum received amounted to \u00a34,265. September. \u2014 About this time, H. G. Surtees, esq., purchased the manor and estate of Dinsdale, near Darlington, from the trustees of the Earl of Durham, for \u00a340,000. The estate, which had formerly belonged to the family of Surtees, was purchased by W. Lambton, esq., in the year 1770, for \u00a315,000. October 8. \u2014 A frightful accident occurred this morning on the Brandling Junction Railway, near Brockley Whins. It arose from the collision of two engines, one of them attached to a carriage full of passengers (principally butchers) on its way from Shields to Gateshead. About two miles from Shields, an engine, the Leopard, was observed coming in an opposite direction, but, at so short a distance, owing to the curvature of the line at that part, a collision appeared inevitable. The engineman at once reversed the engines and leaped off, and, immediately after, the engines came into violent collision. Most of the passengers were stunned by the shock, all of them being thrown with great force against the partitions of the carriages. The next moment they found themselves careering away towards Shields at a tremendous rate. On arriving at the station in that town the empty carriages standing there were knocked to pieces, and the engine came in contact with a wall, the shock scattering the passengers in all directions. Two men were killed, seventeen others received most extensive injuries. October 20. \u2014 During the last session of parliament, an act was passed entitled the \"Detached Parts of Counties Act,\" which came into operation this day. By this enactment, Island shire, Norharnshire, and Bedlingtonshire, in Northumberland, and tbe parish of Craik, in Yorkshire, were detached from the county of Durham, and annexed to the counties in which they were locally situated. This alteration added 64,369 acres and a"], [195, "A.D. 1844.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 189 population (in 1861) of 24,903 to Northumberland, at the expense of her neighbour. 1844 (October 28/\u2014 Mr. W. G. Thompson, for 20 years reporter to the \"Newcastle Chronicle,\" was, this day, found dead in the water closet attached to the Literary and Philosophical Institution in Newcastle, with bis throat shockingly cut. lie had been missing from his home during the previous week, in the course of which, entrance to the closet was prevented by his having secured the key. The parties connected with the library repeatedly sent to the Chronicle office for the key, and it was only on finding that his friends had not seen him for so many days that a suspicion of the painful fact entered the librarian's mind. Besides very great professional ability, Mr. Thompson possessed consider able poetical talent and literary attainments, and his contributions to various periodicals, both in prose and verse, were very generally admired. In one or two instances Christopher North paid a tribute to their worth by copying them into the pages of \" Black wood.\" He was 48 years of age. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected mayors and sheriffs in Northumberland and Durham : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Addison Langhorne Potter, esq., mayor ; John Featherstone Aytoun, esq., sheriff.

November 11. \u2014 General Tom Thumb, a dwarf, was exhibited in the Music Hall, Newcastle, on this and the four following days, and there, as elsewhere, drew immense crowds of spectators. The child, who was 25 inches in height and weighed only about 15 lb , was drawn about the streets in a very handsome chariot of most diminutive dimensions. He was represented to be in his thirteenth year, by his exhibitor, Mr. Barnum, one of the most accomplished social humbugs existing at that time, although, in reality, he was only in his fifth year, which Mr. Barnum unblushingly acknowledged, afterwards, when lecturing in New castle on \" Humbug.\" November 20. \u2014 As Mr. Hernaman, proprietor of the \" New castle Journal,\" was proceeding from his residence in Lovaine-row towards his office in Grey-street, he was accosted, near tbe Barras bridge, by Mr. Addison Potter, jun. (eldest son of the then Mayor of Newcastle), who produced a copy of the journal of the previous week, and demanded the name ofthe author of a grossly offensive paragraph, which unjustly reflected on some part of Mr. Potter's family. Mr. Hernaman replied that this was not the place to answer such a question. Mr Potter then introduced himself by name, and repeated his demand for the author to be given up to him instantly. Mr. Hernaman having again refused to comply with the request, Mr. Potter immediately began to apply a whip to the shoulders and legs of the former, whose cries attracted to"], [196, "190 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1844. the spot two or three gentlemen who were passing near, one of whom, in interfering, received an inadvertent cut or two. Mr. Potter apologized to the gentlemen for the accident, at the same time observing to Mr. Hernaman that in case he should hereafter publish any insinuations respecting his (Mr. Potter's) family, he would punish him again in a similar manner. It is, however, proper to add that the authorship of the paragraph in question was generally supposed not to be with Mr. Hernaman. 1844 (November 21/ \u2014 Died, in London, aged 87, Adam Askew, esq., of Redheugh, Gateshead, and Ellington, Northumberland. December 9. \u2014 Mr. Hugh Ross, of the Victoria Inn, Balmbro', and Catherine Simm, his servant, after being present at a wedding party, fell into an open draw well, in a field near their house, and were drowned. The bodies were discovered on the following day, and this singular accident created much excitement in the neigh bourhood. December 10. \u2014The body of William Jacklin, one of the gamekeepers at Haggerstone, Northumberland, was found at the foot of Kyloe Craggs, over which he had fallen. Death had apparently been instantaneous. December 18. \u2014 A skiff match took place on the river Tyne, for \u00a3100 a-side, between Robert Coombes, the champion of the Thames, and Henry Clasper, the champion of the Tyne, the distance being from Newcastle Bridge to Lemington Point. Clasper ran foul of a keel near the Skinner Burn, but though he lost much ground, Coombes only won at last by six boat lengths. Thx boats were built for the occasion, Coombes' weighing 43 lb., and Clasper's (which was built by himself) 49 lb. On the following day the friends of Coombes proposed that he and Clasper should, in the following week, try their skill again in another skiff race, and they offered to stake \u00a3200 on behalf of Coombes to Claaper's \u00a3100. The challenge was accepted, and \u00a320 was at once deposited with Mr. Joseph Hair, Quayside, by Coombes, and \u00a310 by Clasper. The whole of the money was to be deposited within three days. Clasper's friends were ready with their money, but the other party failed to fulfil their part of the agreement, although the challenging party, and the result was that, after some disputing, the Clasper party claimed and obtained the forfeited \u00a320. 1845 (January 3). \u2014 A fatal and melancholy accident occurred at Arthur's-hill, Newcastle, on the evening of this day. Miss Dodds, of Richmond-street, was proceeding up William-street, at Arthur's hill, accompanied by a daughter of Mr. Belough, builder. At the top of the street there is an extensive stone quarry entirely unprotected, and the night being dark, Miss Dodds was led to suppose the ground was solid, from the appearance of some lights immediately opposite. She unfortunately stepped over the edge, and was precipitated a depth of fifty feet. She was found at the bottom of the quarry, quite dead."], [197, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 191 1845 (January 13/ \u2014 Mr. Edward Wood, a person who had performed th6 character of clown, in the Christmas pantomime at Newcastle Theatre, sailed from the King's Meadows to Tyne Bridge in a washing-tub, drawn by four geese. The exhibition attracted an immense concourse of spectators. January 21. \u2014 The Mayor of Newcastle (A. L. Potter, esq.) and Mrs. Mayoress gave a grand ball at the Assembly Rooms, which, for splendour and numbers, had not been equalled in this town since the meeting, of the British Association. Up to near midnight parties continued to arrive, and before supper was announced 917 ladies and gentlemen were present, amongst whom weie the leading families of the town and neighbourhood. On the supper-room being opened, every requisite was presented to the guests in the greatest profusion. Indeed, the whole of the enter tainment was got up on the most sumptuous scale. February 25. \u2014 A company, which proposed to supply Newcastle and Gatesheai with water from the Whittle Dean Burn, purchased the works of the previously existing Water Company for \u00a355,000, being equal to a premium of \u00a310 on each \u00a325 share. The Whittle Dean scheme, which was projected by Mr. Grainger, received the royal assent June 30th, 1845, and the company took possession of the old reservoirs on the following August. March 21. \u2014 The death of Mr. Alderman Batson took place this day, under very afflicting circumstances. Mr. Batson had driven his wife to BeUingham Church in his phaeton, and was returning to his residence, at Reedsmouth, when the horse became restive and overturned the vehicle down a precipitious hill, on the south side of the river Reed. Mr Batson's head came in contact with a tree, and he was killed on the spot. Mrs. Batson, though bruised, sustained no serious injury. March 29. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 83, the Rev. Edward Moises, M.A. The deceased was educated at the Grammar School in Newcastle, to the mastership of which he was appointed in 1787, on the resignation of his celebrated uncle, the Rev. Hugh Moises. He also held the office of morning lecturer of All Saints', and after noon lecturer of St. Andrew's. In 1806 he succeeded his uncle in the mastership ofthe Virgin Mary Hospital, and in 1811 Lord Eldon presented him to the Vicarage of Hart. In the Oriental language few scholars have ever surpassed Mr. Moises. His \" Persian Interpreter,\" published in 1792, and the \" Arabic Bible,\" printed at the Newcastle Chronicle office in 1811, are striking proofs of his diligence and learning. Aprril 3. \u2014 Another of those calamities which from time to time occur in the colliery districts happened this evening, about six o'clock, in the West Moor Pit, near Newcastle, the property of Lord Ravensworth and Partners, which resulted in the sacrifice of ten human beings. At the time of the explosion there were twelve men and boys in the mine, two of whom survived, although severely burnt."], [198, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1845. 192 1845 (May 12/\u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 63, John Brown, esq., for upwards of thirty-five years clerk to the magistrates of that borough.

May 26. \u2014 Married, in London, Lord Lovaine, eldest son of the Earl of Beverley (now Duke of Northumberland), to Louisa, eldest daughter of Henry Drummond, esq., of Albury Park, Surrey. June 9. \u2014 This afternoon a violent explosion of gunpowder took place in the shop of Mr. Steele, grocer, Glaypath, Durham, the consequences of which, though of a serious nature, are yet of a less dreadful character than might have been apprehended. It appeared that Mr. Steele had been in the habit of keeping a quantity of gunpowder on hand, which he sold to colliers and others. A shop boy having placed a candle near to a package containing about 31) lbs. of that commodity, it became ignited, and exploded with a terrible crash, the effects of which were felt in every part of the city, and the windows of the shops and houses in the immediate neighbourhood were almost entirely destroyed. The front of the house in which the calamity occurred, and all the floors and furniture, were blown into the street. A young woman, named Ann Robson, who fell with the second storey, was seriously injured, and the apprentice who had caused the disaster was killed. Mrs. and Miss Steele were also buried in the ruins, but were extricated very little injured. June 10. \u2014 This evening an affair occurred in Church-street, Durham, which created a great sensation in that city. It appeared that Mr. Louis Henry Goule, one of the superintendents of rural police, detected his wife iu company with a gentleman, under circumstances which caused him to fire two pistols at her, breaking her arm in two places. He then attacked the intruder, Mr. Walter Scruton, deputy clerk of the peace, with the butt end of the pistol, inflicting considerable injury on the head. In a few moments, however, the man was taken into custody and removed to the gaol, where he made an ineffectual attempt to cut his throat with a penknife. On the 16th, Mrs. Goule died from the effects of the injuries she had received, and her husband was tried for the murder, before Mr. Baron Rolfe, at the following assizes, and acquitted on the ground of insanity. June 12. \u2014 The Rev. John Hodgson, the celebrated historian of Northumberland, died at Hartburn, aged 66. The deceased was appointed incumbent of Jairow in 1808, and it was on that classic ground that he first conceived the idea of his well known history. The work was received with great favour by all persons of taste and literary acquirement, and Bishop Barrington marked his approba tion by voluntarily conferring upon its author the vicarage of Kirkwhelpington, following up that with a present of \u00a3200. Successive portions ofthe History appeared in 1827, 1828, 1832, 1835, and 1 840, but just towards the completion of his labours he"], [199, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 193 was seized with a serious illness, which incapacitated him from future mental exertion, and his noble work consequently remains in a fragmentary state. In 1833 he was appointed to the vicarage of Hartburn by Bishop Van Mildert, and he then resigned his other preferments, to the great regret of his parishioners. 1845 (June 23/ \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Meiklam's br m Inheritress (Lye) beating Merry Andrew and Lightning, with fourteen others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Bell's ch h Winesour (Bumby), beating Mr. Ramsay's br h Midlothian and Colonel Craddock's br h Pagan. The Gold Cup, manufactured by Messrs, Reid and Sons, from a drawing by the late Mr. Benjamin Green, architect, consisted of a silver group, repre senting a scene from Mazeppa. Mazeppa, bound to a horse, which lies exhausted on the ground, is surrounded by wild horses and vultures, and rescued by a female. July 8. \u2014 A suit in chancery, which had been pending since August, 1836, between the Coporation of Newcastle and the Master and Brethren of the Jesus Hospital, in that town, terminated this day. The hospital was founded by the corpora tion, in 1681, for the support of forty freemen and freemen's widows, and it was then endowed with two small estates, and Whittle and Etherby, purchased at the time for \u00a33,610, and producing about \u00a3100 per annum. In 1720, however, the corporation sold the estates, and, with the proceeds (\u00a33,815^) and various other moneys, they purchased the Walker estate for \u00a312,224. From time to time the payments of the corporation to the hospital were increased to about \u00a3640 yearly, but the inmates of the hospital contended that the endowment should bear the same proportion to the rental of Walker estate as the \u00a33,815 had borne to the original purchase money. This would have increased the funds of the hospital to nearly \u00a31,500. In 1842, Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, made a decree in favour of the hospital, but the corporation appealed and counsel were addressing the House of Lords, this day, when the Lord Chancellor (Lynd hurst) interposed, praised the \" great generosity\" of the corporation, and recommended, as a compromise, a future payment of \u00a3800 a year. To this the corporation agreed, on condition that ten additional brethern should be appointed, and an Act to carry out this agreement received the royal assent, August 26, 1846. July 17. \u2014 Died, at Howick Hall, Northumberland, in his 82nd year, Charles, Earl Grey, Viscount Howick, Baron Grey, K.G., &c. The first ofthe family of Greys mentioned in ancient records as belonging to the manors of Howick is Sir Ralph Grey, of Chillingham. The more direct ancestor of the late lamented noblemen was Baron Grey, of Werke, who was ennobled in the reign of James the First. The title then became dormant for some generations. His lordship, who was born at Falloden on the 13th of March, 1764, was elected one of the representatives of North umberland on the 13th of March, 1786. His maiden speech was VOL. III. b 1"], [200, "194 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1845. delivered on February 21st, 1787, on the subject of Mr. Pitt's commercial treaty with France, and gave presage of the extraordi nary talent for debate by which his long parliamentary career was subsequently distinguished. Although a mere stripling, the extensive and correct knowledge of our foreign mercantile relations which it displayed, the forcible arguments by which he sustaned his attack upon the ministerial policy, and the ease, elegance of style and delivery by which this speech was distinguished, showed that a luminary had appeared in the political horizon, whose course was likely to shed lustre on the legislature and the country. The estimation in which he was held at that early period of his career is best proved by his having been chosen one of the twenty-four managers of the celebrated impeachment of Warren Hastings, and his speeches on tbat subject, and on the Regency Bill in the following year were long remembered as powerful efforts of eloquence and reasoning. \" He professed himself,\" he said, \" as ready to support the real splendour of the royal family as any slippery sycophant of the court, but he thought there was more true dignity in manifesting a heart alive to the distresses of millions, than in all those trappings which encumber without adorning royalty.\" On the accession to power of Mr. Fox, on the death of Mr. Pitt in 1806, Mr. Grey (who had then become Lord Howick) was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, and on the death of Mr. Fox. in the following year, his lordship became his successor as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and leader in the House of Commons. The death of his father, which took place shortly after, removed him to the Upper House of Parliament. His lordship now took the title of Earl Grey, by which appellation he was known to the present generation. The abortive attempt of George IV., whilst Prince Regent, in 1812, to induce him and Lord Granville to join the Perceval Administration, illurstrated the integrity of his principles and the consistency of his conduct, and throughout his long public life he continued the able and uncom promising advocate of civil and religious liberty. The important question of Parliamentry Reform had occupied his lordship's attention from almost his entrance into Parliament, and he re peatedly brought it forward in the House of Commons. In 1830, on the dissolution of the Wellington Government, Earl Grey was impowered by William the IV. to form a ministry, having \" Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform,\" as the basis of its policy. Accord ingly, on the lst March, 1831, the Reform Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, and after an arduous and protracted struggle, almost amounting to a convulsion, it was eventually carried through Parliament, and received the royal assent on tha seventh of June, 1832. When Earl Grey ceased to hold office, in July, 1834, spontaneous tokens of gratitude sprung tip in every quarter. On the 19th of August, 1834, Earl Grey attended a monster meeting in the Guildhall. Newcastle, when addresses were presented to him from Tynemouth (by Henry Metcalfe, esq ), from South Shields (by Bryan Abbs, esq.), from Newcastle (by the Rev."], [201, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 195 J. S. Ogle), and from the stewards of the Incorporated Companies (by William Garrett, esq.) All the addresses concurred in con gratulating his lordship on his return to his native county, and in expressing the high sense they entertained of his great public services. The noble earl also received similar expressions of good feeling from his friends in Hexham, Sunderland, Alnwick, Felton, Morpeth, Glendale Ward, and Berwick. In his speech at Berwick his lordship said \u2014 \" It is an easy matter to say go onward, persevere, push forward reforms; do not temporize, but apply at once a severe remedy wherever an evil exists \u2014 never mind whether the constitution of the patient is able to bear such a severe remedy or not. Such language may be popular, but such will never be the language of a good and a wise statesman.\" Few public men have enjoyed a larger amount of popular respect. His strongest political opponents never imputed to him an over-eagerness for office, nor dared to question the integrity of the motives by which he was actuated. He was the last of the historical statesmen, his name being associated with Burke, Pitt, Fox, Sheridan, &c. A description of the personal appearance of Earl Grey in the vigour of his days will not be uninteresting to those who only knew him when advancing years began to affect his frame. His port and bearing were strikingly dignified, high birth was legible in every lineament ot his features, and his whole exterior was decidedly patrician. His figure was stately and commanding, his- action graceful and animated, his forehead lofty and well developed, and his voice strong, flexible, and sonorous. As an orator, he was ready and correct, his style classically pure and void of affectation, his delivery such as to fix, and even fascinate, the attention, while his arguments were couched in diction which evinced the well educated and well-disciplined mind. The remains of the noble earl were interred in a strictly private manner, in the family vault, at Howick Church. The body, which was borne by six members of his household, was followed, on foot, by his afflicted family and relatives, consisting of Lady Caroline Barrington, Lady Georgiana Grey, Lady Mary Wood, Miss Barrington, Earl Grey and five of his brothers, the Earl of Durham, Sir George Grey, bart., Mr. Elice, Mr. C. Wood, and Mr. Barrington, and a number of his admirers from the surrounding district also joined the procession on its way to the church. The coffin bore the simple inscription \u2014 \"Charles Earl Gret, K.G. Born March 13, 1764; Died July 17, 1845.\" His lordship married, November 18th, 1794, Mary Elizabeth, only daughter of Lord Ponsonby, by whom he had a family of ten sons and five daughters, twelve of whom, as well as her ladyship, survived him. 1845 (July 31/ \u2014 At the Northumberland Assizes, before Mr. Justice Creswell, Mr. Addison Potter, son of the Mayor of Newcastle, was charged with an assault on Mr. John Hernaman, proprietor of the \" Newcastle Journal.\" The assault was com mitted with a riding whip on the 20th November, 1844, in the streets of Newcastle, and occurred in consequence of an article"], [202, "196 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1845. which appeared in the \" Newcastle Journal\" of the 16th November. Mr, Potter was found guilty and sentenced to two months imprisonment in Morpeth Gaol. 1845 (August 1/ \u2014 An alarming fire broke out this evening in the Pudding-chare, in the premises occupied by Mr. Perry, treacle manufacturer. The upper floors of the building, which was of great height, were filled with corn and basket rods, and the whole was speedily in flames and completely destroyed. The premises were the property of Mr. Humble, basket maker, whose loss was very great. August 9. \u2014 Two dreadful murders were perpetrated this evening, at Barnard Castle, under very remarkable circumstances. Joseph Yates, a tailor, had been drinking with three young men, named George Barker, Thomas Routledge, and John Brecken, who, having discovered that Yates had a little money in his possession, determined to force it from him. \u2022 About midnight, when he was in company with a female, named Catherine Raine, the three men, with a girl named Ann Humphreys, followed him to a place on the banks of the Tees, and, after a short scuffle, they took the money from him, and then threw him into the river, where he was drowned. On returning over the bridge into the town, the men threatened vengeance on the girls unless they would swear to secrecy, but, as Raine refused to accede to their request, she was seized, thrown over the parapet wall, and the river being much swollen, she was carried away and was drowned. Humphreys, having sworn to keep the matter a secret, was permitted to go home. The bodies were sound a few days after, and strong suspicion rested on the above parties ; but Humphreys kept her oath for nearly a year, and when she at last disclosed the horrible affair her unsupported testimony could not be relied on, and the men were accordingly acquitted of the murder at the York Assizes, in August, 1846. Further evidence was, however, obtained to corroborate the girl's testimony, and the three ruffians were arraigned for the robbery only, on the 16th of March, 1847, and were clearly convicted of the crime. The Judge sentenced them to fifteen years' transportation, expressing his heartfelt regret that the law had failed to reach them on the capital charge. The two trials cost the county of York \u00a31,500. August 13. \u2014 A vacancy having occurred in the representation of Sunderland, by the elevation of Lord Howick to the House of Lords, the nomination\" of candidates took place before the Mayor (J. Allison, esq.) Mr. Joshua Wilson proposed, and Mr. Joseph Hill seconded, Colonel Perronet Thompson. Mr. J. J. Wright proposed, and Mr. Richard Spoor seconded, George Hudson, esq. The show of hands was in favour of Colonel Thompson, but the result of the poll on the following day was as follows : \u2014 Hudson, 626 ; Thompson, 498. Shortly after the close of the poll, Mr. Bright, Mr. Moore, and Colonel Thompson addressed an immense concourse of people from the balcony of the Bridge Hotel. They attributed the result of the election to"], [203, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 19 197 a want of union, and to several of the leaders, who formerly marshalled the electors, having taken a neutral, if not an opposite, position. The greatest order prevailed throughout the day. 1845 (August 13/ \u2014 Died, in the Bigg-market, Newcastle, aged 63, Mr. Emerson Charnley, bookseller, and a member of the Town Council. He was a member of the Old Common Council, and was returned to the new body on the change which succeeded the passing of the Municipal Reform Act. Connected with an old established firm, taking an interest in the principal institutions of the town, and being of a peculiary accessible friendly and homely disposition, no man was better known in Newcastle and the neighbourhood than Emerson Charnley. August 15. \u2014 An alarming railway collision occurred on the line between Sunderland and Brockley Whins, about half-past three, p.m. The mail-train, after leaving Sunderland, came in contact with the train from Newcastle, both proceeding at a quick pace at the time The collision was fearful. The mail-train passengers included Mr. Charles Tee, a railway proprietor, of Barnsley; Mr. Brunton, town clerk, of Sunderland; Mr. Richard son and Mr. Gutch, solictors, of York, who had been assisting in the election of Mr. Hudson ; Mr. Falvey, of the Anti-Corn Law League ; several other gentlemen, and about half-a-dozen ladies. Not a single person travelling by the train escaped injury, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Gutch were both sadly bruised, especially the latter gentleman, whose face was painfully disfigured ; Mr. Falvey sustained a contusion on the leg ; the stoker had his arm broken ; while the engine-driver, seeing his danger, saved himself by leaping off the engine ; a boy, named Hogarth, was frightfully bruised and cut ; all the women were severely stunned, and the iron of the engine and tender was shattered to pieces. The occurrence took place at the junction of two lines, where there is only a single row of rails, and where the signal flags for the Newcastle train to stop were actually hoisted at the time. When the engine driver was asked why he did not stop, he was unable to give a satisfactory answer. August 20 \u2014 In consequence of the rain which fell on this and the two days preceding, the river Ain rose to a greater height than at any former period within memory, and vast quantiites of hay and corn on the banks of the stream were carried away. Several sheep and goats were also lost, and, at Bolton, a farm steward and his son, named Cook, were drowned whilst endeavouring to save some sheep. The Till was also very much swollen, and serious damage was done in many places. August 21. \u2014 A fearful explosion occurred this afternoon, at Jarrow Colliery, the property of D. Brown, esq. Mr. Jobling, the viewer, in company with Mr. Brown, were walking towards the pit at the time when they observed an unusal amount of smoke, and on reaching the heap the accident immediately became apparent. About seventy-five men and boys were at work at the time, thirty-six of whom were employed in the Low Main Seam"], [204, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1845. 198 where the explosion took place, and of these only one man was saved. The other men were working in the Bensham Seam, 160 feet above the others, and, owing to the air-courses being partially destroyed they suffered severely from after-damp, and three men, named James Stewart, Benjamin Robinson, Robert Fairgreave, and a boy, named Baird, died. A brave man, named Defty, an overman, also lost his life iu endeavouring to rescue others. A subscription was commenced for the benefit of the sufferers, and nearly \u00a31.800 collected. 1845 (August 30/ \u2014 Died, in Blenheim-street, Newcastle, in his 80th year, William Anthony Hails. The deceased belonged to that class of self-educated men whose ardent pursuit of knowledge raises them above the obscurity and difficulties of early life. He was to trade a ship-carpenter, but afterwards became an eminent teacher, which profession he followed in Newcastle for upwards of 30 years. He was a most laborious and indefatigable student, and his mind was well stored with a fund of knowledge on almost every branch of science, but his chief study, and for which he became most eminent, was a knowledge of languages. He culti vated, more particularly, an acquaintance with the Eastern tongues, and there were few, if any, his superior in a critical knowledge of Hebrew, and was a frequent correspondent of the \" Critical Journal,\" in which he successfully encountered some of the first Hebrew scholars of those days. He was the orginator, and for many years the most active supporter, of the Benevolent Society, the precursor of the present Sick and Indigent Society. He was the author of some valuable essays on the Unitarian Controversy, but his principal work was his reply to \" Volney's Ruin of Empires,\" a work of great research and erudition. September 4. \u2014 Married, at Lamesley Church, the Hon. John A. Douglass, Envoy Extraordinary at St. Petersburgh, and eldest son of Lord Bloomfield, to the Hon Georgiana Liddell, youngest daughter of Lord Ravensworth. Great rejoicing took place at Ravensworth, where the grand entrance hall was thrown open for the first time. September 4. \u2014 The discussion between the Rev. W. Cooke and Mr. Joseph Baker, on the question, \" What is a Christian and his principles ?\" was brought to a close this evening, after extending over a period ot three weeks. The room was crowded every evening, and, considering the excitement that popular disscussions invariably create, order was pretty well maintained throughout. On each occasion Mr, Cooke was allowed an hour and a half to state his sentiments, and Mr. Barker was allowed an equal time for reply. Mr. Cooke defended the fundamental principals of Christianity, basing his arguments on the Scriptures, and calling to his aid such other evidence as was necessary to maintain the truth and support the dignity of the Gospel. Mr. Barker, on the other hand, denied the authenticity of the chapters in the New Testament containing the account of the miraculous"], [205, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 199 conception, and, as a necessary consequence, rejected from his creed the whole doctrine of the Trinity. In closing the discussion Mr. Cooke answered some of the statements of his opponent, and charged him with having misquoted his sentiments. He then entered on the subject of the personality and Godhead of the Holy Spirit, and proceeded to defend the Trinity as a doctrine of revealed religion. As the discussion progressed, and more especially at the conclusion, the feelings and judgment of the audience were manifestly in favour of Mr. Cooke, and if the question had been put as to which system was true, there would have been at least twenty to one on the side of the orthodox faith. 1845 (October 3). \u2014 Owing to heavy rains the river Tyne was greatly flooded, and much injury was done to the shipping lying at Newcastle and Shields. Large quantities of hay and corn were swept from adjacent lands, and timber, keels, and other craft were drifted down the stream, the rapidity of the current preventing any effort to stop their progress. The King's Meadows and several miles of the Carlisle Railway were quite under water. An immense quantity of agricultural produce was likewise destroyed on the Tweed and Wear. October 15. \u2014 Several of the scholars of Dr. Cowan's Academy, Bishopwearmouth, were bathing in the sea, at Hendon, in company with five of their teachers, when a strong current swept several of the party into deep water, and one of the teachers, named Special, two youths, sons of Sir David Baird, bart., Newbyth, East Lothian, and Robert M. Leny, son of J. McAlpine Leny, esq., of Dalwinton, Dumfriesshire, were unfortunately drowned. October 22. \u2014 Mr. John Fram, aged 49, was found dead this morning, about seven o'clock, in a water tub, on his own premises, at Ridley-villas, Newcastle. It appeared that the deceased had been recommended by his medical adviser, Mr. Tullock, to bathe his head frequently in water, and whether in attempting to do so he had fallen in, or whether he had intentionally thrown himself into the tub, could not be ascertained. October 28. \u2014 A dinner was given at the George Inn, New castle, to Henry Ingledew, esq., deputy-recorder, by the members of the legal profession resident in that town, to mark their sense of the able manner in which he discharged the duties of his office The chair was taken by John Fenwick, esq., the vice-chair by William Kell, esq., and thirty-three members sat down to a sumptuous repast. October. \u2014 About the end of this month a skeleton was found, in perfect preservation, in a yard attached to Sir Matthew White Ridley's glass-works, at the Ouseburn, Newcastle. It was supposed to be the remains of a member of one of the three families who originally introduced the manufacture of glass into this district, and who were known to have had a private burial ground. October 28, \u2014 A purse of forty guineas was presented to the Rev. George Heriot, as a testimony of tbeir affectionate regard,"], [206, "200 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1845 and as an acknowledgment of his services since his appointment as their minister, by the congregation of St. Ann's Chapel, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 1845 (November 1/ \u2014 The workmen in the employ of Mr. W. Wailes, glass- stainer, Newcastle, entertained Mr. Francis W. Oliphant to dinner at Mr. Lowes, Thornton Arms, Thornton-street, Newcastle, on which occasion Mr. W. Wailes, Mr. G. Wailes, and Mr. Oliphant, were the invited guests. The chair was filled by Mr. Campbell, supported by Mr. J. Rodgers. After the usual toasts of the evening, Mr. Oliphant was presented with an elegant chased silver box, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, of Newcastle, and drawing instruments, as a slight mark of their admiration and regret at his leaving Newcastle for London. November 10. \u2014 The ninth of November having fallen on a Sunday, the election of chief magistrates for the boroughs in the counties of Northumberland and Durham took place this day, with the following results : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Thomas E. Headlam M.D. ; Matthew Robert Bigge, sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 Thomas Cummins. Durham \u2014 John Bramwell. Sunderland \u2014 Robert Brown. Morpeth\u2014 Nicholas Wright. Stockton \u2014 John Crossby. Berwick \u2014 Thomas Hogarth ; William Smith, sheriff. November 22. \u2014 Died, at Ravensworth Castle, in her 73rd year, Marie Susannah, wife ofthe Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth. The whole of her ladyship's family, with the exception of the Marchioness of Normanby, the Hon. Mrs. Villiers, and the Hon. Mrs. Bloomfield, who were residing abroad, were present on the melancholy occasion. The account of her ladyship's death was received with sorrow throughout the entire neighbourhood, as she was well known for her amiable disposition and Christian benevolence. The deceased was the third daughter and co-heiress of John Simpson, esq., of Bradley Hall, Durham, by Lady Ann, daughter of Thomas, eighth Earl of Strathmore, and by the death of her last surviving sister, in Feburary, j 844, she eventually became sole heiress of the extensive possessions of the ancient families of Simpson and Anderson, of Bradley. The deceased, in March, 1796, married Thomas H. Liddell, esq., afterwards a baronet, and eventually Lord Ravensworth, and she left a family of seven sons and as many daughters, most of whom she had the happiness to see connected by marriage with some of the noblest families in the kingdom. Possessed of great means of doing good, Lady Ravensworth was never known to fail in making use of them, and the almhouses built and endowed by her for the deserving poor of the Ravensworth and Eslington properties, will long remain a proof of her munificence and charity. November 25. \u2014 The skiff race, for \u00a3100 a-side, between Clasper, of Newcastle, and Pocock, of London, took place on the Tyne, in the presence of several thousands of spectators, Clasper, at the termination, being at least a quarter of a mile in advance. November 25. \u2014 Died, at Chimney Mills, aged 49, Mr. William Andrew Mitchell, formerly editor and proprietor of the \" 'Tyne"], [207, "A.D. 1845.] REMARKABLE EVENTfe. 201 Mercury,\" which journal he conducted, after the death of his father, upwards of 25 years The deceased was also the editor of the \" Newcastle Magazine,\" a periodical started by himself, and carried on with an energy rarely found in the provinces. He was also the author of \" Tim Tunbelly,\" \" Peter Putright,\" a drama called \" Crohore of the Billhook,\" \" Essays on Capacity and Genius,\" \" Thoughts of One that Wandereth,\" and many fugitive pieces. Through life he was an able and consistent advocate of Liberal principles, and few men have descended to the grave more regretted by their friends. 1845 (November 26/ \u2014 A tremendous boiler explosion took place at the Bishopwearmouth Ironworks, causing a great injury to the premises and sacrifice of life. About sixty workmen were in the building at the time, and, from the prodigious force of the explosion, nearly the whole of them were buried by the falling in of the roof, or scalded by the steam which filled the place. Four men were dead when extricated, two more died soon after, and upwards of thirty others received very serious injuries. The property adjoining was also greatly damaged, large pieces of iron being propelled in all directions. December 5. \u2014 Robert A. Davision, esq., solicitor, of Sunderland, and clerk to the trustees of the county of Durham turnpikes, committed suicide by hanging himself in his greenhouse. At the inquest, a person named Rennison, who resided next door to Mr. Davison, was examined. He stated that he observed the deceased go into his greenhouse, when shortly afterwards he heard a scream from the servant girl, on which he ran to the greenhouse, where he saw the body of Mr. Davison hanging by the neck to a beam, with the feet on the ground, and the knees bent in a drooping position. He was quite dead. No reason was assigned for the rash act, December 8. \u2014 A splendid white woodcock was shot in Harehope Wood by O. A. B. Cresswell, esq. Perhaps so rare a bird has seldom or ever been seen in those parts. December 11. \u2014 The secluded village of Netherton, in Coquet- dale, was the scene of great bustle and social harmony on this day, it having been the place where Walter Selby, esq., of Biddlestone, was to receive a testimonial of his neighbours' gratitude. When Mr. Selby came into possession of the Biddle- stone estates he found that his predecessor had accumulated many heavy debts, for which the contractor alone was responsible, and for which he (Mr. Selby) was not legally liable. He, however, immediately put into operation a system of the most rigid economy, and, after some years of self-denial and sequestration, he accumu- lated sufficient to pay every one in full. This highly honourable conduct was the occasion of the presentation. At two o'clock Mr. Selby arrived in his carriage, in company with his sister, Miss Selby, the lady of the Vicar of Whittingham, Mrs. Goodenough, and Mrs. Riddell, of Felton Park. As they drew up to the Star Inn the welkin rang with peals of cannon and the huzzas of the vol. m. C 1"], [208, "202 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1845. assembled multitude. After a few minutes' stay in the inn, Mr\u201e Selby accompanied Mr. Burrell, of Broome Park, into an open carriage, when a massive silver shield, value 100 guineas, with a representation of Sir Walter de Selby of yore, in victorious combat with David, King of Scotland, was placed near Mr. Burrell, who then addressed Mr. Selby as follows: \u2014 \"My dear Mr. Selby, I have been desired by the committee of gentlemen, who have solicited the honour of your attendance on this occasion, to present you with a memorial of their respect and gratitude for a kindness of a very distinguished and particular nature. It has given me the greatest pleasure to accede to their request, not only because it entails on me the duty of recording their honourable feelings, but because it gives me an opportunity of expressing my admiration of the conduct which drew forth those feelings. For what you, sir, are pleased to consider a simple act of justice is, in truth, one of the most disinterested generosity \u2014 a voluntary sacrifice sor the benefit of others, a gallant assumption of responsibility where no real or actual responsibility existed. There are many persons who in your case would have gladly taken advantage of the immunities which the law provides for them- But not so with you. You could not enjoy life with the reflection that any one, however remotely or incidentally, should suffer a loss which it was in your power to redress I must be permitted to add that my gratifica tion in discharging this pleasing duty has been greatly enhanced hy the thought that the whole act in question has been performed by a neighbour and a friend, by the descendent of a race of gentry which, for more than 500 years, have flourished on this spot where we are met to commemorate the worth which attaches here to the soil and endears him to its inhabitants. I must take the liberty of calling your attention to the embossment of the shield, which represents a gallant achievement of one of your family in ancient times, and to which you were not likely at any time to have drawn public attention.\" After the ceremony, 160 gentlemen sat down to dinner, William Burrell, esq., presiding. The chairman was supported upon the right by Mr. Selby, Mr. Riddell, of Felton Park, the Rev. Mr. Hoggett, and Mr. Thomas Selby ; upon the left by Mr. Clavering, Callaly, Captain Collingwood, Glanton, Rev. Mr. Goodenough, Whittingham ; Jasper Gibson, esq., of Hexham, filled the vice-chair, supported by the Rev. Mr. Proctor, Vicar of Alwinton, Dr. Henry Crea, Wittingham, and the Rev. Thomas Ord, Callaly. 1845 (December 9/ \u2014 A man, named Robert Joicey, 57 years of age, died suddenly at Cockle Park, near Morpeth, and, in con sequence of suspicious circumstances, his son Ralph, who lived with him, was soon after apprehended in Newcastle, at the residence of WiUiam Joicey, Hutton's-court, Pilgrim- street, another son of the deceased. The prisoner immediately admitted his guilt, and, from his statement, it appeared that about two months before the occurrence he bought a quantity arsenic, in Morpeth, of Mr. Creighton, chemist, and having mixed a portion of the poison in"], [209, "a.d. 1846.] remarkable events. 203 some jalap, he disguised himself and left the packet at a public house where medicine for his father was frequently left by his medical attendant, Dr. Hedley, of Morpeth. The packet bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" I make you a present for Joicey. Take this large powder in a glass of ale or a glass of wine, and the smaller one in a little honey or jelly, the one at night the other in the morning.\" The contents of the packets were given to the old man, who immediately after became \"dl and died. The prisoner was tried and convicted before Mr. Justice Coleridge, February 26th, 1846, and was executed at Morpeth on the 18th March following. 1846 (January 8/ \u2014 A dreadful accident took place this after noon close to the Railway Station, South Shields. Whilst a number of workmen were employed in removing a quantity of ballast from an enormous heap of that substance, a portion of the hill came down upon them, before they had time to escape, and two men, named Thomas Bradford and John Burn, were killed. Upwards of a dozen others narrowly escaped the same fate. January 14. \u2014 As Mr. Thomas Clarke, of the firm of Clarke, Plummer, and Co., of the Ouseburn Spinning Mill, Newcastle, was returning on horseback from Kibblesworth, he called at the house of Mr. Plummer, on Gateshead Fell, and on returning to the public road he had to pass a well where some girls were getting water, at whom the horse took fright and Mr. Clarke was thrown from his seat falling heavily on the ground. Being perceived by some parties near he was immediately carried to an adjoining house and the aid of Sir John Fife, Mr. Talmadge, and Mr. Davies was speedily proeured but it was of no avail. The unfortunate gentleman had received such severe internal injuries as to cause his death in a few hours. January. \u2014 During this month, two seamen belonging to the ship Ariadne, of Greenock, having received relief at the New castle Infirmary, on their return to the vessel they give such a good account of the benefits and comforts of the valuable institution, that Captain MacKellar, his officers, and crew immediately raised the sum of seven pounds as a donation. February 3. \u2014 This morning, a little before five o'clock, the extensive steam-engine manufactory of Messrs. Robert and William Hawthorn, at the Forth-banks, Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire, and such was the rapid progress of the flames that within two hours a large building in the centre of the works, which was used as the locomotive tender and the pattern depart ment, was completely destroyed. Some of the detached workshops were, however, preserved. The loss was estimated at upwards of \u00a310,000. This was the third time the premises of Messrs. Hawthorn had suffered from fire. See Sykes, March 10th, 1832. February 3. \u2014 A boy, named Foggon, little more than two years old, wandered from his home, at Lorbottle, near Rothbury. The following morning the neighbours having dragged the mill ponds and searched the burns, afterwards repaired to the adjoining"], [210, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1846. 204 hills, when a shepherd's lad, belonging to Mr. Drysdale, was attracted by his cries, and found him lying on his breast, at a place called the Long Craig, a distance of* nearly four miles from his home, and after having endured the exposure more than 25 hours. His preservation is the more remarkable from his having passed several old coal workings during the night. 1846 (February 4). \u2014 A fatal accident occurred at Messrs. Stephenson's engine manufactory, South Street, Newcastle, by which a young man, named William Phelan a native, of Alnwick, lost his life. It appeared that Phelan and a fellow workmen, named Bruce, was engaged in grinding a piece of iron on a grindstone, which was driven by an engine, when suddenly, without any warning, the stone flew into pieces with tremendous force, one of the parts flying upwards and breaking the beam and the floor of the upper room, and then striking the steam pipe in its descent, broke it, and filled the building with steam. The other portions of the stone were driven in all directions. Phelan was found some distance from the place, with his head frightfully shattered. He died at the Infirmary two hours after the accident. February 6. \u2014 The extensive paper mill of Messrs. Hutton, Fletcher, & Co., Ayres Quay, near Sunderland, was completely burnt down this morning. The fire was first discovered about six o'clock by some workmen, who observed masses of smoke issuing from the windows. In about ten minutes more, the whole mill was enveloped in fire. When it reached the room where the rags and ropes and other material are kept, the fury of the devouring element was greatly increased, and its progress became irresistible. The flames rose to a great height, and the roof fell in about fifty minutes from the time of the fire being discovered. The workmen had been on strike for the previous three weeks, and as the estab lishment had consequently been closed, strong suspicions were abroad that it was wilfully occasioned. February 8. \u2014 This evening an alarming disturbance took place at Black Hill, between the English and Irish workmen employed at the Derwent Iron Works. It appeared that during the evening several of the workmen were drinking in a public house, kept by Mr. Moore, and a fight took place, in which one of the combatants, an Irishmen, was severely beaten. This so excited his companions that they immediately collected together a numerous body of their countrymen, some armed with sticks, others with pokers, shovels, and similar weapons, and they forthwith made an indiscriminate attack upon all in the village. The first person they met was a man named George Patterson, who was instantly felled to the ground. Another man, named Gilroy, was so mal treated as scarcely to be recognized. The rioters then attacked the public house, and in a short time every pane of glass was broken, the inmates making a precipitate retreat by the back part of the premises. By this time the whole place was in a state of the utmost alarm and excitement, and the English workmen, in order to defend themselves, were obliged to give battle to the"], [211, "A.D. 1846.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 205 assailants. The consequences may be imagined. The parties attacked each other with loud yells and in the most ferocious manner, and it was not until two o'clock in the morning that the riot had expended itself. The Irishmen retreated, leaving six lying on the ground bleeding, and having about forty others seriously injured. Information of the disturbance reached Superintendent Hall, at Whickham, and he hastened to the place with a strong body of policemen, and succeeded in apprehending nine of the principal rioters, who were immediately taken before Peter Annandale, esq., who committed them to prison. Three of those left on the field of battle subsequently died of their wounds. 1846 (February 12). \u2014 Afine specimen ofthe Trichiuvus Lepturus, or Blade Fish, 13 feet 9 inches long, was caught near Alnmouth, and was afterwards exhibited at Alnwick. This was supposed to be the first specimen of this rare fish caught alive in Britain. February. \u2014 The following are in the list of new patents applied for during this month : \u2014 Conrad Haverkam Greenhow, of North Shields, gent., for improvements in the construction of railways and railway carriages, sealed 6th January, 6 months for enrolment ; Henry Watson, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, brass-founder, for improvements in withdrawing air a!nd vapours from furnaces or other apparatus, and in condensing and employing such vapours, sealed 6th January. 6 months for enrolment; Robert Bewick Longridge, of the Bedlington Iron Works, near Morpeth, North umberland, for an improved locomotive engine, sealed 13th January, 6 months for enrolment ; William Benson, of Allerwash House, Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, gent., for certain improvement in machines for tbe manufacture of tiles and other plastic substances, sealed 15 th January, 6 months for enrolment. March 10. \u2014 A pugilistic encounter took place on Blyth Links, between William Cleghorn and Michael Reilly, both of Newcastle. After fighting not less than two hours and a half, Cleghorn was declared the victor. Reilly received such severe injuries that he died early on the following morning. Cleghorn was convicted of manslaughter at the Summer Assizes, before Mr. Justice Cresswell, and was sentenced to six months hard labour. March 16. \u2014 A little boy, named Taylor, employed at Spital Tongues Colliery, near Newcastle, escaped a dreadful death in a most extraordinary way. Taylor was occupied at bank, pushing the corves of coals from the shaft to fill the waggons, and he occasionally steadied the corves over the moulsh of the shaft to descend into the mine. While engaged in the latter occupation a projecting rod from the corf caught his waistcoat and dragged him into the shaft, down which he fell head foremost. The shaft is 60 fathoms deep, and his fellow workmen shuddered as they thought of his certain death. Judge their surprise when, a moment afterwards, a voice came up the shaft \" I've got hold of the rope, pull me up,\" and, strange as it may seem, at a depth of upwards of 1 80 feet had this boy in his perilous descent seized the rope, which was connected with the corf about to descend, and"], [212, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF s_A.D 1846. 206 sustained his weight until brought to the surface, having received no other injury than a slight graze on one arm and leg. 1846 (March 16/\u2014 Whiist two boys, sons of Mr. Robert Lynn, of Derwenthaugh Lamp Black Works, were playing by the Derwent river, near Swalwell, the younger, who was five years of age, fell in, and his brother in attempting to get him out was drawn in also. The alarm being given by some companions, a young man, named William Kirsopp, ran to the spot, plunged into the river, and rescued the two little fellows, who were just sinking, being quite exhausted. March 26. \u2014 The foundation-stone for the erection of other four new cottages at the Master Mariners' Asylum, near Bent House, South Shields, was laid by R. Ingham, esq., of Westoe, in the presence of a numerous and highly respectable party of ladies and getlemen. The Rev. J. Carr offered up prayer on the occasion, and the meeting was addressed by R. Ingham, R. Anderson, J. Hargrave, and R. Findley, esqrs. April 12. \u2014 This morning a serious accident happened on the Brandling Junction Railway, at Templetown, near South Shields, in consequence of an engine, which was conveying a heavily laden passenger train, running off the rails and falling over an embankment into a cottage, belonging to Mr. George Swalwell. As the accident was almost momentary there was no time for escape, and the engine fell perpendicularly through the roof, destroying the whole of the house, and burying Mrs. Swalwell, her son and sister (Sarah Rippon) in the ruins. From the position of the engine and the force of the steam, which was escaping amongst the ruins, it was with considerable difficulty that the sufferers were got out. The son escaped unhurt, but the females were not so fortunate. Mrs Swalwell escaped with a broken leg. Sarah Rippon died a short time after the accident. The engine man and fireman were thrown on the top of an adjoining house, the former received several severe bruises, but the other escaped unhurt. The passengers were considerably alarmed, but with the exception of a man, named John Blanchland, who had one leg broken and the other fractured, they all escaped. April 19. \u2014 A fire broke out this evening in a building in the Castle Yard, on the Palace Green, Durham. The flames raged for nearly six hours, but, fortunately, they were confined to the building. How the fire originated could not be accounted for, as the premises had been locked up for a considerable time. The damage was estimated at about \u00a3400. April 28. \u2014 A massive silver tureen and salver, value \u00a3130, were presented to Mr. Alderman William Henry Brockett, of Gateshead, by the merchants and shipowners of Newcastle and neighbourhood, to mark their sense of his services in connection with the removal of the passing toll levied on shipping by the Corporation of Scarborough. The plate was presented by Mr. G. Straker, and Mr. Brockett was afterwards entertained at dinner at the Three Indian King's Hotel, Quayside, Newcastle."], [213, "A.D. 1846.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 207 1846 (May 12/ \u2014 A fire occurred in the farm premises of Messrs. W. and R. Green, of Crawcrook, near Gateshead, by which nine stacks of grain and much other property was destroyed. It was supposed to be the work of an incendiary, a quantity of cotton being found in the stackyard. May 24. \u2014 A lad, about seventeen years of age, named William Bowman, residing with his brother, who is a hairdresser in Clive-street, North Shields, was discovered to have hung himself under very extraordinary circumstances. The parties are natives of London, and had resided only a few months at Shields. On Sunday their father visited them from Newcastle, and on his return in the evening, the elder brother accompanied him to the train, leaving deceased in the house. On the brother's return he found the door locked inside, and as no one answered his knock, another door, leading from a side passage, was broken open, when the unfortunate youth was found suspended from the ceiling, quite dead. The deceased was dressed precisely similar to a culprit whom he had recently seen executed, and the neck was protected from the cord by a pillow, which had been placed between it and the rope. No reason whatever could be assigned for the act. May 24. \u2014 Died, at Nettlecombe, Somerset, aged 86, Sir John Trevelyan, bait., of that place, and of Waliington, Northumber land. In 1798 he raised the Waliington troop of cavalry, of which he was commandant. Sir John was succeeded in the baronetcy and family estates by Walter Calverly Trevelyan, his eldest son, born in Newcastle on the 31st of March, 1797. June 11. \u2014 This afternoon a magnificent vessel, named the Marlborough, was launched from the building-yard of Messrs. Smith, at St. Peter's, near Newcastle. Precisely at half-past five the signal was given, and the vessel glided smoothly and majesti cally into its native element, amid the firing of cannon and the cheers of the assembled multitude. The Marlborough was 1,300 tons burthen, and the largest vessel ever before built on the Tyne. June 11. \u2014 This afternoon a boiler suddenly exploded at the Tow Law Iron Works, near Wolsingham, Durham, by which two men and a boy lost their lives, and several persons were much injured. Great damage was also done to the works, June 21. \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred at Hartlepool, by the upsetting of a yacht, in which were three brothers, named Travers, aged respectively 34, 30, and 28, all clerks in respectable offices, and Thomas Westall, a waterman. The party was proceeding from Hartlepool to Middlesborough, but were caught by a squall, and all of them were drowned before assistance could be rendered. June 22. \u2014 The match between Newell and Clasper, which had excited extraordinary interest, came off this day on the Tyne. The amount at issue was 100 sovereigns aside, and the distance to be performed about five miles, being from Newcastle Bridge to Lemington. The contest resulted in the victory of Newell by about fifty yards. Never, perhaps, on any similar"], [214, "208 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1846. occasion was there seen such a mass of spectators, and \" Haud away Harry\" was echoed and re-echoed from each side of the river. 1846 (June 23/\u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The North Derby was won by Lord Eglinton's b c Dolo (Marston), beating Mr. Cooke's br c Fancy Boy and Mr. W. Scott's Sir Tatton Sykes. The Northumberland Plate was won by Lord Eglintion's b c Dolo (Prince), beating Mr. J. Bell's ch h Winesour and 12 others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. J. Bell' ch h Winesour (Bumby), beating Mr. O'Briens bl c Mentor and Colonel Craddock's br c Jinglepot. July 4. \u2014 A girl, named Catherine Hindmarsh, aged 19, residing in Hign-street, Bishopwearmouth, was sent by her mother to a shop in the neighbourhood, but she never returned home. On the following morning she was discovered lying dead at the bottom of Galley's Gill, a precipice upwards of 80 feet in height. Cries of \" Murder\" were heard in the neighbourhood about mid night, and it appeared certain that the unfortunant girl had come to a violent end, but nothing was ever elicited to clear up the mystery. July 5. \u2014 A melancholy accident happened to a promising young man, aged 22, son of Mr. William Marshall, of Westoe. An aquatic pleasure party had been at sea in a boat, near Marsden Rocks, and one of the party had taken a loaded double-barrelled gun into the boat for the purpose of shooting seagulls. The major part of the party having come on shore, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Galloway returned to the boat for the purpose of re-embarking when, owing to some accident, the gun went off, and the contents were discharged into. Mr. Marshall's body. He was immediately conveyed to Peter Allen's marine grotto, where he shortly after wards expired. July 5. \u2014 A terrific thunderstorm occurred in Newcastle and the surrounding district, during which a young woman, named Mary Elliot, living at Cramlington, was killed by the lightning. July 14. \u2014 The eighth great meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society commenced at Newcastle, under the presidency of Lord Portman. The principal object of the meeting was to bring together all the most approved means of cultivating the soil and performing the multifarious duties appertaining to agriculture, and especially to show the improvements of which the breeding and fattening of live stock are susceptible. Great preparations had been made for several months previous, and thirteen acres of the Town Moor, behind Eldon-place, had been drained, enclosed, and divided into sections for the show of live stock and implements, and a spacious pavilion had been erected in the Forth for the public dinner. On the 14th and 15th the judges of implements and stock made their awirds, and on the 16th and 17th the cattle show was thrown open to the public. On both days the number of persons anxious to inspect the exhibition greatly surpassed the anticipations of the committee, and it was found necessary to make additional"], [215, "A.D. 1846.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 209 entrances in order to relieve the pressure at the doors. In the afternoon of the 16th the great dinner took place in the Forth. Covers were laid for 1,300, the utmost number which could be accommodated, and many gentlemen were disappointed in obtaining admission. The chair was taken by Lord Portman, and the vice- chair by the Earl of Egmont. Amongst the distinguished visitors were His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke o\u00a3 Cleveland, the Earl of Chichester, the Earl of Buchan, Lord Morpeth, Lord Polwarth, Sir Roderick Murchison, Dr. Buckland, Mr. George Stephenson, and almost every landed gentleman in Northumberland and Durham. The following nobleman and gentlemen were also in the town during the week : \u2014 The Marquis of Downshire, the Marquis of Bute, the Earl of Hardwicke, the Earl of Durham, the Earl of Sheffield, Lord Rivers, Lord Hawke, Baron Knesebeck, the Marquis de St. Oppootune, from the Azores, Dr. Moberg, from Copenhagen, M. Kynander, from Finland, C. F. W. Jeppe, Rostock, &c, &c. On the 17th a general meeting of the society was held in the Music Hall, which concluded the proceedings, Lord Portman, who presided, paid a high compliment to the mayor (Dr. Headlam), the corporation, and the local com- mittee, for the excellent arrangements they had made. 184b (July 30). \u2014 Died, at Westgate-hill, Newcastle, aged 79, Mr. Robert Roxby, many years clerk in Sir M. W. Ridley and Co.'s bank. As a member of society, Mr. Roxby conciliated the esteem and respect of all who had the happiness to be acquainted with him. Iu the local literature of the North of England he was also favourably known. His \" Lay of the Reedswater Minstrel\" and various minor poetical pieces have been many years before the world, and in connection with his \" Coquetdale Fishing Songs\" his name will long be remembered in these districts. July. \u2014 This month a number of workmen were set to work to remove the stoothing and plaster which had, from time to time, been put upon the inner walls of the ancient chapter house of Durham cathedral. After much labour they succeeded in exposing the original walls, and the ornamental interlaced arches. This noble building, when in its original state, and previous to its being desecrated by modern improvements, was, in tlfe Norman style of architecture, considered without a rival in the kingdom. It was built by Bishop Rufus, when the Norman style had reached its perfection ; it measured internally about 80 feet in length, 37 in breadth, and about 45 in height, the east end being circular. The interior was decorated with Norman columns and intersecting arches. Against the eastern wall stood an ancient stone chair, in which the bishops of the see, from Carilepho to Barrington, had been successively installed. The roof was elegantly groined, and the floor rich with inscriptions. There was a large perpendicular window of stained glass at the east end, above the doorway and tracery. Between the chapter house and south transept is the VOL.

Thomas Knight and the Marquis of Waterford, came on for trial at the Northumberland Assizes, before Mr. Justice Wightman, the Court of Exchequer having determined that the ruling of Baron Rolfe, on a previous occasion, was erroneous. The jury, after a four days trial, found a verdict for the plaintiff, thus establishing the claim of the rector to the tithes. The dispute was eventually compromised, the plaintiff receiving \u00a310,000 for his retrospectivejclaims, and a rent charge of \u00a3800 per annum. August 7. \u2014 An inquiry was instituted before Mr. William Baker, deputy-coroner, at the Crown, High-street, Shadwell, London, relative to the death of Mr. Isaac Tucker, aged 37, whose death occurred from intoxication. It appeared that the deceased, who resided at Gateshead, where he carried on the business of a pipe maker, was the author of two dramatic works, which he was desirous should be published by a London house. He had gone to London for that purpose, and whilst there obtained a tasting order for the London docks, where the deceased drank about half-a-pint of different wines. On leaving there he went to the old Rose, Shadwell, and had two glasses of brandy and water. The deceased then became insensible, and in this state he was removed to the station, in King David-lane, where he was left. In about half-an- hour he seemed in a dying state, when Mr. Ross, a surgeon, was sent for. He tried to bleed him, but without effect, and life became jg Verdict \u2014 \" Apoplexy from excessive drinking.\" August 9. \u2014Newcastle and neighbourhood were visited by a violent thunderstorm and heavy rain. The storm proceeded in a westward direction, and about two o'clock the electric fluid struck a row of houses, called Greenhow's-terrace, Scotswood road, and did considerable damage. No fewer than fifteen persons were struck down ; some of them were dreadfully scorched in various parts of the body. Medical assistance was at once pro cured and the whole were eventually restored to consciousness. Three bridges erected over the Middleton Beck, on the Tees, were carried away ; the bridge at Egglesburn was thrown down, and a number of cottages at Egglestone were almost entirely demolished. At Barnard Castle the river rose 15 feet above its usual level, and a great number of Sheep, lambs, and pigs, and an immense quantity of hay were lost. At Milburn, Northumberland, the lightning set fire to a hawker's cart, which, with its contents were destroyed. August 21. \u2014 Great i.sensation was created in Berwick this morning, on it becoming known that the North of England Branch Bank had been entered during the night, and notes and coin to the^, amount of \u00a33,000 carried away. It appeared that Mr. Thompson, the resident agent, had been from home on a leave of"], [217, "A.D. 1846.] REMARKABLE events. 211 absence for a fortnight. In the morning the robbery was discovered by a servant, when the safe was found unlocked, a bolt, proceeding from the room above, having been raised and the whole of the property removed. Intelligence of the robbery was imme- diately forwarded to Newcastle, and Mr. Burdis, accompanied by Mr. Stephens, superintendent of police, proceeded to Berwick without delay. On their arrival, watchmen were stationed round the bank. A searching examination of the premises was then made, and, as the result proved, with perfect success. All the gold and the whole of the silver were discovered secreted under the stairs in the kitchen, and the whole of the notes were soon afterwards found iu the bedroom of Mrs. Thompson, wife of the manager, sewed up in the bolsters and bedding. Mrs. Thompson was immediately apprehended and was tried for the offence on the 26th October, before the recorder, Mr. Ingham, but the testimony of the female servants being somewhat contradictory she was acquitted. 1846 (October 5/ \u2014 A melancholy affair took place in a field adjoining Benton-lane, Newcastle, which ended in the death of a man named Daniel Hives. The deceased was employed in the construction of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, and a few minutes before the occurrence had been struck and severely injured by two Irish navvies, named George Mathews and John Hughes. He immediately followed them, the men threatening to murder him if he came near them. He persisted, however, and the party at length reached a field in which Captain Potts, a magistrate, was standing, when Hives having appealed to him, the captain also followed the men and told them they should not escape. Suddenly the Irishmen turned round and came up to their pursuers, when Mathews pushed Captain Potts aside and plunged a knife into the right groin of the unfortunate Hives, and killed him on the spot. Through the coolness and persistency of Captain Potts the men were soon aster captured. On February 27th, 1847, they were tried before Baron Rolfe, when Mathews was convicted of the murder and Hughes was acquitted. Mathews was executed at Morpeth on the 17th March following. October 12. \u2014 An accident of a most extraordinary character occurred this evening at Walker Iron Works, near Newcastle, the property of Messrs. Losh, Wilson, & Bell. It appeared that cries of distress were raised in a portion of the premises, and, on search being made, a man named Davies, and a youth named Spearman, were found dead on the floor of a privy. It was then discovered that one of the branches from the great blast pipe was leaking, and the air in it having become impregnated with carbonic oxide and carbonic acid gas, the place had become filled with the poisonous mixture, and the deceased had been suffocated. In about half an-hour after this lamentable occurrence, another catastrophe took place, by the bursting of the air receiver, the explosion of which was so terrific that it was heard for several miles around. One man, named Robert Rogers, standing near the mouth of the"], [218, "historical register of [a.d. 1846. 212 regulator, was blown a prodigious distance and killed immediately, and some others had fractured limbs. The reservoir itself, though of great solidity, was blown to fragments, and one piece of it, after rising an immense height, descended upon a wooden post, 170 yards from its original seat, with such violence, that the post actually pierced the thick iron plate. Nearly all the windows in the neighbourhood were blown out by the force of tbe explosion, which caused great excitement from the singular circumstances attending it. 1846 (November 9/ \u2014 The election of mayors for the boroughs in the counties of Northumberland and Durham took place, with the following result : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 James Archbold, esq., mayor ; Joseph Crawhall, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 Thomas Revely, esq., Sunderland \u2014 Robert Brown, esq. Durham \u2014 William Davison, esq. Stockton \u2014 John Crosby, esq. Morpeth \u2014 Richard Lewins, esq. Berwick \u2014 George Johnston, esq, M.D., mayor ; Alexander Cahill, esq., M.D., sheriff. November 10. \u2014 The foundation-stone of Trinity Presbyterian Chapel, New Bridge-street, Newcastle, was laid by the Right Hon. Fox Maule, M.P., Secretary at War. The church was designed by Mr. Dobson, and is in the early English style, with very little ornament, but has two angular towers 82 feet in height. It accommodates 850 hearers. The expense of the building was \u00a33,000. A public breakfast took place previous to the ceremony, at which the mayor and sheriff of the town attended. The chapel was opened October 8th, 1847, by the Rev. J. Hamilton, of London. December 12. \u2014 One of the greatest snowstroms which has occurred during the present century, commenced this morning throughout Northumberland and Durham. The trains upon the various railways converging to Newcastle were greatly delayed, and towards the evening they were altogether brought to a stand ; one train from the south being blocked up at Leamside, and a second at Fence Houses. The storm extended as far north as Edinburgh, west to Haydon Bridge, and south to Darlington. On the 13th no train whatever was able to leave Newcastle, and, to clear tbe line southwards, six engines, coupled together, conveying about 200 excavators, were ordered to Fence Houses, but, after five hours exertion, they were only able to reach Washington. The mail which left Newcastle for the north, with much difficulty reached Newton-on-the-Moor, where it was blocked up in a snow drift, 20 feet deep. A young man, belonging to Chillingham, lost his life near Lilburn. Much injury was done to household pro perty during the storm, by the falling of roofs, owing to the immense quantity of snow accumulated upon them. The eaves of a house in Richmond-street, Newcastle, gave way, and the entire roof was precipitated into the street. The roof of a house in Norfolk-street, North Shields, occupied by Mr. Moffat, tailor, was forced off in the same manner. The poor were put to cruel privations in conse quence of the traffic in coal being quite suspended, as well as all"], [219, "a.d. 1847.] remarkable events. 213 out-door employment, but a thaw set in on the evening of the 18th, and the snow gradually disappeared. 184 7 (January 11^) \u2014 A seizure was made by Mr. Thompson, collector of excise, of a soap manufactory in the New-road, Newcastle, when it was discovered that, besides the small apparatus ordinarly seen at work, the parties had formed a communication with an adjoining warehouse by the means of an ingeniously constructed secret door, and a large quantity of soap was found therein. The loss to the revenue was calculated to have been upwards of \u00a36,000. The place was occupied by four brothers, named Allan. January 16. \u2014 Died, at Westoe, aged 59, Christopher Blackett, esq., of Wylam. Mr. Blackett entered the army early in life, and served for some time under Sir Henry Burrard and the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular campaigns. On the return of peace he settled at his ancient family seat of Oakwood, near Newcastle, and in 1830 he was elected a representative of the borough of Beeralston, for which he sat until the general election in 1831. In 1836 he was invited to come forward for Newcastle, on the death of Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart, but after a very exciting contest he was defeated by John Hodgson, esq., of Elswick, Hodgson polling 1,576, Blackett 1,528. In the following year, however, he was elected for south Northumberland without opposition, and he represented the county till 1841, when his declining health obliged him to retire into private life. The deceased was succeeded in his estates by his eldest son, J. F. B. Blackett, esq. January 19. \u2014 A public meeting was held in Newcastle, Sir John Fife, in the absence of the Mayor (James Archbold, esq), in the chair, for considering the best means of relieving the awful famine prevailing in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. Upwards of \u00a34,000 was subscribed in the town and neighbour hood, and transmitted for the relief of the sufferers. Similar meetings were held at the other towns in the district, and tbe total amount subscribed was exceedingly large. February 7. \u2014 This day the retired and pleasant village of Newbrough, situated about five miles to the west of Hexham, was thrown into a state of the greatest excitement. On enquiries being instituted, the excitement was found to have arisen from a report that a man named Thomas Proud, hind to Mr. Maughan, of Newbrough Lodge, had been brutally murdered by a labourer at the Prudholm Stone Quarries, named James Welch. It appeared that Proud, who was a married man with a family, had one of his children christened on that day, and the party had afterwards, as is unfortunately too frequently the case in the country districts, adjourned to a public-house in the village, kept by a person named Surtees, for the purpose of prolonging the festivities of the eventful occasion. The murderer Welch was one ofthe party, and whilst at the inn a quarrel took place between him and the unfortunate man Proud, The parties were ultimately pacified, and nothing further"], [220, "214 historical register of [a.d. 1847. was thought of the matter by those present. Such, however, was not the case with Welch, whose rancour did not abate by the friendly interposition of his comrades ; but, on the contrary, grew deeper as the hour for departure drew near. On leaving the inn the party separated, apparently on good terms, each going to their various destinations. Welch appears to have followed Proud, and when in a lonely part of the road, he pounced upon him and cut his throat with a clasp knife in a dreadful manner. Such was the fearful nature of the wound that the poor man died almost imme diately, and before assistance could be rendered him. Welch at once made good his escape, and eluded the vigilance of the police for some time, but was ultimately captured at Fourstones, a village about a mile distant from Newbrough. He was at once locked up, and after undergoing the usual preliminary examinations, was com mitted to take his trial at the assizes. On the 28th February he was tried before Baron Rolfe, found guilty, and sentenced to death in the usual manner. During the period between the sentence and the execution, the prisoner was very penitent, and admitted the justice of his sentence. He was executed at Morpeth on the 17th March following, in the presence of a large concourse of spectators, the affair having created considerable excitement. 1847 (February 11/ \u2014 Died, at Alnwick Castle, in his 62nd year, His Grace the Duke of Northumberland. His grace had been suffering for a short time from an attack of influenza, but he eventually died somewhat suddenly. Hugh, Duke and Earl of Northumberland, Earl Percy, Baron Percy and Warkworth, was Lord-Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county of North umberland, Vice-Admiral of Northumberland and Newcastle-upon- Tyne, Constable of Launceston Castle, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, President of the Royal Humane Society, and Fellow of numerous learned institutions. His grace was born on the 20th April, 1785, and, after being educated at Eton and Cambridge, he entered Parliament in 1806, as member for Buckingham. In 1807 his grace was returned for the county of Northumberland, which he continued to represent until 1812, when he was called to the House of Lords by the title of Baron Percy. In July, 1817, he succeeded his father in the family honours, and in 1825 his grace was required to serve his majesty as Ambassador Extra ordinary at the coronation of Charles X., King of France. The whole expense of that costly mission was defrayed by his grace, who astonished the Continental nobility by the magnitude of his retinue, the gorgeousness of his equipage, and the profuseness of his liberality. In politics the deceased was a firm and consistent Conservative, in private life he was generous without ostentation, and the extent of his liberality was commensurate with the ample means at his disposal. The duke married, in 1817, Lady Charlotte Florentia Clive, youngest daughter of Earl Powis, a lady whose polished manners and general amiability won for her the distin guished office of governess to her present majesty. February 19th, the remains of his grace arrived at Newcastle, on their way to"], [221, "A.D. 1847.] REMARKABLE EVENTS 215 London, for interment in Westminster Abbey. The mournful procession was met on tbe Town Moor by the Mayor, Sheriff, and several members of the Town Council of the borough. The shops were closed throughout the town. Minute guns were fired from the Old Castle, and the flag hung half-staff high. About thirty carriages joined in the procession, together with 200 horsemen, A long line of Newcastle gentlemen, including some members of the Society of Friends, followed the hearse on foot to the Gateshead station, where the Mayor and Corporation were also in attendance. Lord Prudhoe joined the train at Darlington, to officiate as chief mourner at the interment, which took place on the 23rd, with much ceremony. The noble family of Percy is descended from Mainfred, a Danish chieftain, who made irruptions into France in the ninth century, and whose posterity, settling in Normandy, took their name from their domain of Percy, in that province. William de Percy, with his brother Serio, came over to England with the Conqueror, and obtained large possessions in York and Lincolnshire. In the reign of Henry II. , Agnes, heiress of the Percy family, married Joceline de Loraine, second son of Godfrey, Duke of Brabant, who thereupon assumed the name of Percy. Their descendants were among the most powerful barons in the North of England. ALNWICK CASTLE AND BRIDGE. 1847 (February 14 j \u2014 An accident occurred on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, by which Mr. William Robson, son of Mr. Robson, draper, Dean-street, Newcastle, was killed. It"], [222, "216 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1847. appeared that the deceased, being late on reaching the Howdon station, ran on to the platform without paying his fare, and, as the train had started, he proceeded direct to a carriage, but being too precipitate in opening the door, he lost his balance, and, swinging round, fell underneath the carriages, and the wheels of six of them went over his legs before the train could be stopped. He was conveyed to Newcastle with all possible despatch, but before the train reached the station he had breathed his last. 1847 (February 23j. \u2014 An alarming fire occurred this afternoon in the premises of Messrs. Copland and Jones, wholesale chemists, Sandhill. Newcastle, unfortunately attended with loss of life. Mr. Nicholas Moody, the clerk, and a labourer, named John Bowman, were engaged in sealing a carboy of turpentine in the upper storey of the premises, when the liquid, by some means, took fire, and the vessel bursting from the heat, the place was soon in one body of flame. Mr. Copland and an assistant, named Lockey, escaped by jumping out of a window, but Moody and Bowman, although they succeeded in getting down stairs, died in the Infirmary very shortly after. The damage was estimated at upwards of \u00a31,200. March 6.\u2014 The drafts of the North of England Joint Stock Bank were refused payment in London, and, on the intelligence reaching Newcastle on the following day, the greatest consternation prevailed. The chief office of the company was in the Arcade, Newcastle, but it had branches in Sunderland, North and South Shields, Durham, Berwick, Morpeth, Blyth, Hexham, Alnwick, and Wooler. The bank was commenced 1832, being the first on the joint stock principle established in Newcastle, its nominal capital being \u00a32,000,000, in 20,000 shares of \u00a3100 each, but the amount absolutely paid up was only \u00a3340,755 on 18,096 shares, and 420 proprietors were on the register at the time of the failure. Very heavy losses had been incurred by the company at an early period of its existence, and it subsequently transpired that the entire paid up capital was lost, prior to 1837. The liabilities of the concern, when the suspension occurred, amounted to \u00a31,864,854, and the deficiency was then estimated at \u00a3144,493, but that sum proved to be only about one-third of the actual loss borne by the shareholders. All attempts to raise the required amount, by voluntary calls, proved ineffectual, and the bank was placed under the powers of the Joint, Stock Companies' Winding-Up Act in November, 1848, three official managers, Messrs. Henderson, Hewson, and Ross, being appointed. A call of \u00a330 per share, made by them, produced \u00a3240,000 ; a second call of \u00a320 realized \u00a3100,000; and a third of \u00a315, \u00a335,000, the diminished amount showing the exhausted condition of the unfortunate shareholders. In June, 1855, \u00a33 per share were returned to the comparatively small number of persons who had paid the whole of the calls, and this was shortly afterwards followed by a second return of \u00a35, and a third of \u00a37 per share. March 20. \u2014 This morning, about nine o'clock, a fatal boiler explosion occurred at Burradon Colliery, near Newcastle. A few"], [223, "A.D. 1847.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 217 minutes previous to the occurrence, the engineman, on examining the float, sound the water more than a foot above the working mark, but, as the steam was low, he gave directions to the stoker, Robert Thompson, to raise the fires, soon after which the boiler suddenly burst with a tremendous noise, carrying away part of the engine-house and chimney, killing three persons, and injuring, more or less, several of the workmen at the shaft. The engineman escaped, though much scalded and bruised, but the stoker, a female, named Margaret Proctor, and a boy, named James Gordon, were killed on the spot. 1847 (March 25). \u2014 The Right Hon. George Dawson, one ot the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Customs, met, by appointment, at the Custom House, Newcastle, deputations from the Corporation and the Chamber of Commerce of Newcastle, and the shipowners and merchants of North and South Shields, to consider the applications for increased Custom House facilities at the latter place. The Newcastle deputation consisted of the Mayor, the Town Clerk, Aid- Hodgson, Mr. Armstrong, Mr. R. Plummer, Mr. W. H. Brockett, Mr. W. R. Hunter, Mr. John Jobling, Mr. S. Lowery, &c, and that from Shields consisted of Mr. Mitcalfe, M.P., Mr. Dale, Mr. Linskill, Mr. Barker, Mr. Crighton, Mr. Leitch, Mr. Pow, Mr. Shotton, Mr. Dryden, Mr. C. Laws, Mr. Spencer, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Swinburne, &c. It was ultimately decided that those gentlemen should meet a deputation of Newcastle merchants to discuss the subject, and on the following day it was determined, without any dissent, that the port of Newcastle should remain undivided, but that auxiliary establishments should be formed at North and South Shields, affording the same facilities to merchants in those towns as were possessed by persons resident in Newcastle. A document to this effect was signed by all the parties present, and it was laid before Mr. Dawson on the 27th, when that gentleman expressed his gratification at the harmonious result of their deliberations. March. \u2014 About this time Messrs. Carr & Co., had in their pos session, at the Mansion House, in the Close, Newcastle, an oak tree, containing upwards of three hundred cubic feet of timber \u2014 most of it sound \u2014 which had recently been extricated from the bed of the river Tyne, where it must have been for many centuries. April 17. \u2014 A serious accident occurred at the Crookhall Iron Work3, near Shotley Bridge, by which six persons were killed and several others seriously injured. It appeared that an old mau and his daughter, mongrel ballad singers, went to the works, and were engaged in amusing the men with a song when the boiler suddenly burst with a tremendous explosion, killing the old man and his daughter, the fireman, two of the workmen, and also a stranger. The boiler was torn to fragments, and portions of it were blown an immense distance. April 20. \u2014 A young man, named John Bourne, very respectably attired, took up his residence at Mr. John Cox's, Ord Arms Inn, Scotswood, near Newcastle, for the ostensible purpose of being VOL.

Bourne's deport ment, altogether was such that not the slightest suspicion was at tached to his proceedings until this afternoon, when the drawer containing the money, together with a cash box in which it was deposited, were found to have been broken open, and the entire contents taken away. Information of the robbery, with a full des cription of Bourne, was conveyed to Mr. Stephens, the superintend ent of police at Newcastle, who immediately put into operation the electrie telegraph. On Bourne making his appearance on the platform at Normanton Station, he was immediately taken into custody, with the whole of the money in his possession. He was tried at the Northumberland Midsummer Sessions, and sentenced to ten years' transportation. 1847. (April 26J \u2014 Mr. Thomas Harrison, a respectable plumber and glazier in Alnwick, 60 years of age, committed suicide this morning, while in a depressed state of mind, arising from his heavy liabilities as a shareholder in the North of England Joint Stock Bank. May 7. \u2014 A fatal accident occurred at Messrs, Spoor's file manu factory, situate at Hanover Square, Newcastle, One of the work men, named Thomas Stockdale, aged 31, while at work at a large grindstone, which was turned by the factory engine, injudiciously allowed it to go at too much speed, when suddenly it split into three pieces, one part ascending upwards with such force that it broke through the roof, the second downwards through the floor, and the third struck Stockdale on the forehead, and killed him on the spot, whilst his wife, who was standing by his side, miraculously escaped unhurt. May 19. \u2014 An old man, named Archibald Elliott, but better known in the neighbourhood of Morpeth as \"Auld Archie,\" was drowned in a stream near Ulgharo, whilst conveying the mail bags to that place. He was a very curious little deformed old man, 84, years of age, and, although unible to either read or write, none could deliver a message better, and seldom, if ever, did he make a mistake with any letters entrusted to his keeping, which showed his wonderful memory, as it was only by the size and shape of a letter that he could tell who it belonged to or from whom he had received it. He was only four feet in height, and had carried the mail between Morpeth and Widdrington, with the assistance of his ass \" Billy,\" for upwards of thirty years. June 16 \u2014 A groom, named Nicholas Morrow, in the service of Miss Walters, Whickham, near Gateshead, absconded, taking with him two sovereigns belonging to his mistress. Nothing was heard of him until the 19th, when, in consequence of the house having been entered during the night, and Miss Walters's cash box con taining \u00a320, and a great number of jewels, to the value of \u00a3400, having been stolen, suspicion fell upon the lad. Superintendent"], [225, "A.D. 1847.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 219 Hall was informed of the robbery, and in a short time Morrow was traced to the Crown Inn, South Shields, where he had displayed a purse containing a large sum of money. He was immediately conveyed to prison, and on searching him upwards of \u00a3144 and some silver was found upon him, as well as a pistol, spyglass, and patent lever watch. 1847 (June 17j. \u2014 Died, at North Shields, Mr. Joseph Laing, jun., solicitor and bank agent. The deceased was an enthusiastic admirer of his native town, and was at all times foremost in the advocacy of any measure calculated to promote the comfort and happiness of his fellow townsmen. To him the borough was principally indebted for the new Town Hall, and a fine bust of him was afterwards executed at the cost of his friends and placed in that building. June 22. \u2014 A dreadful explosion took place at the Felling Colliery, near Gateshead, the property of Messrs. Carr and Co., by which four men, two boys, eighteen horses, and two ponies were killed. Only four persons in the mine escaped unhurt. June 22. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The North Derby was won by Lord Eglinton's br c Van Tromp, by Lanercost (Marston), beating Helias, George Hudson, and Christopher. The Northumberland Plate was won by Lord Eglinton's b c Eyrx (Prince), beating Executor, Conjurer, Grimstone, Inheritress, and ten others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Greene's b c The Conjurer, beating Grimstone, Helias, Winesour, and Sir Tatton Sykes. Grimstone and Conjurer ran a dead heat. The Gold Cup was substituted by a silver centre piece, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, representing an American Indian taming a wild horse on the prairies. June 25 \u2014 Died, at Cologne, aged 72, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Askew, K.C.B , of Pallinsburn, Northumberland. The deceased entered the army in 1793, and served with great credit in Flanders and the Peninsula and at the battle of Waterloo. His remains were interred at Ford on July 14th. July 1. \u2014 The remaining portion of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, namely from Morpeth to Chathill, was opened for public traffic, thus completing the great line of railway communi cation between London and Edinburgh. On July 5th the mail coach between Newcastle and Edinburgh arrived in the former town sor the last time, after being established sixty-one years. The pace required by the Post office, at its establishment, in November, 1786, was seven miles an hour, and no innkeeper in the town could then be found to contract for a speed considered so ruinous to horseflesh except the landlord of the Cock Inn, Head of the Side. For some years before its discontinuance its speed averaged ten miles. July 17. \u2014 A race, between the Scottish Maid and Harvest Home steamboats, for \u00a350, came off at sea, from the Herd buoy, at the mouth of the Tyne, to the buoy off Sunderland bar and back, a distance .of about 12 miles. As this was the first match between"], [226, "220 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1847 two Tyne boats, considerable interest was excited, which was increased by the fact that, independent of the wager, it was a trial of the capabilites of the builders and engine-makers of the respective boats. The Scottish Maid, owned by Mr. A. Strong, was built by Mr. James Dowey, and the engins were fitted up by Messrs. Conolly and Scott. The Harvest Home, the property of Mr. Joseph Hall, was built by Mr. William Cooper, and the engines fitted up by Mr. J. Almond, all of North Shields. The boats were alike in size, with 25-inch cylinders to the engines, equal to 22 horse power. The Harvest Home had the call in the betting at 5 to 4. They went off with considerable swiftness, leaving ali the other boats behind, some of them of 40-horse power. After a gallant run, the Scottish Maid came back a winner by about half a-mile. The distance was gone over in one hour and twelve minutes. 1 847 (July 23/ \u2014 This day Parliament was dissolved and writs were immediately issued for the new elections.

N, Grace and Oo., at Scotswood, near Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire, and although several fire-engines were immediately despatched from Newcastle, the flames consumed the whole of the premises. The stock and valuable machinery were also destroyed,"], [228, "222 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1847. and the damage was estimated at upwards of \u00a38,000. The fire blazed with great fury for some time and attracted spectators for miles around. 1847 (August 9).-\u2014 A melancholy accident occurred to Mary Bell, a servant at the Half-Moon Inn, Mosley-street, Newcastle, who while cleaning a second story window, missed her hold and fell on to the pavement. She was immediately taken to the Infirmary but died in a few hours. September 8. \u2014 Married, at Wynyard, by the Bishop of Durham, the Earl of Portarlington to the Lady Alexandrina Vane, second daughter of the Marquis of Londonderry. Amongst the company present were the Dukes of Rutland, Cleveland, and Devonshire, Viscounts Somerton, Dungannon, and Combermere, Lords Belhaven and Eliot, Sir Robert Peel, Sir J. W. Hogg, &c, &c. A grand banquet was given in the evening to the distinguished visitors, and on the following day a splendid ball and supper were prepared, to which all the leading inhabitants of the district were invited. September 8. \u2014 A public dinner was given in the Turk's Head Inn, in commemoration of the election of Messrs. Ord and Headlam as members for Newcastle, and generally to celebrate the triumph of the Liberal principles in the district. Ralph Carr, esq., of Dunstan Hill, presided, and the vice-chairs were occupied by Sir John Fife, Mr. Alderman Losh, Mr. G. Fenwick, and Mr. John Blackwell. Upwards of 260 gentlemen were present, and the proceedings were very animated. September 17. \u2014 Two men, named Thomas Dobinson and Walter Murray, descended the pump shaft of Percy Main Colliery, near North Shields, sor the purpose of examining the pumping gear which is used for the purpose of drawing the water from the mine. The men who undertake this job are lowered down by means of a gin rope, worked with horses, and, to facilate the intercourse with the surface a string leads up the shaft to a bell. Having completed their work, they gave the signal to pull up. The horses went to their work and the rope ascended, when suddenly something seemed to check it, the horses put forth their strength, and the rope came up without the men. It was broken, and a frightful calamity had happened, the rope having got entangled in the scaffolding. They were killed on the spot. September 25. \u2014 An alarming fire broke out in the farm-yard of Mr. Goundry, a respectable farmer, residing at the village of Westoe, near South Shields. It would appear that a chimney belonging to a cottage immediately adjoining the farm-yard was on fire, and a spark was seen by Fenwick Shotton, mason, to fall on the thatched roof of the thrashing machine, and set it on fire. The flames, notwithstanding every exertion to stay their progress, spread rapidly towards the corn stacks, and set one on fire. The wind, blowing strong at the time, increased the force of the devouring element, until all the stacks in the yard and a large barn were, one after another, set on fire. Nothing could withstand the"], [229, "A.D. 1847.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 223 fury of the flames. The whole produce of a harvest, amounting to fifteen stacks of corn and three of hay, with the barn and thrashing machine, were on fire at one moment. During tbe progress of the fire several persons entered Mr. Goundry's house, and proceeded to throw the furniture out into the street, and pulled down the doors, and tore out the windows, breaking and destroying everything in their way, making the house a complete wreck. Portions of the goods were also stolen, and persons were seen carrying away boxes and other pieces of furniture through the fields to South Shields. The property was uninsured, but a handsome subscription was raised for the unfortunate sufferer. 1847 (September 27/ \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, Wiliam Maclaclan, an eccentric character, better known in the town and neighbourhood by the cognomen of \" Cuddie Willie.\" He was generally seen wandering amongst the low public-houses of the town, and gained a precarious subsistence as an itinerant musician, his violin being generally formed of a flat uncouth-looking piece of wood, upon which he contrived to fasten one or two strings. He was scarcely ever seen to wear either a hat or shoes, and if decent clothing were given to him it was generally made away with sor liquor, of which he was immoderately fond. All efforts to reclaim him proved entirely fruitless, and his death was ultimately caused by a prolonged fit of drunkenness. September 29. \u2014 A remarkable case of fraud and imposture was brought before Mr. Commissioner Evans in the Bankruptcy Court. A Mr. Donald Maclean, who had, in 1839, purchased the Witton Castle estate of Sir William Chaytor for \u00a3100,000, was the bankrupt. Although the money was never paid during his residence at Witton, he took an active part in the affairs and trade of the county, and maintained a splendid establishment. In 1846 Mr. Maclean agreed to pay to Mr. Brett, a picture dealer^ \u00a37,000 for Titian's picture called the \" Six Cjesars,\" and Murillo's \" Abraham and the Angels.\" An arrangement was made, by which Mr. Maclean was to deliver, in payment of the money, 20,000 tons of coal, at 7s. a ton, for a French railway with which Mr. Brett was connected. Fortunately for the latter, he discovered the state of Mr. Maclean's affairs before the pictures were delivered, and con sequently retained them. In a case heard in the Bail Court on the 27th April, 1847, in which Mr. Brett was sued for payment of \u00a3350, on a promissory note, given as a commission \"to a Mr. Gompertz on account of the above abortive sale, it was stated that Mr. Maclean had become a bankrupt, but had gone abroad-and had never, under any pretence of illness, surrendered to the fia^but was enjoying himself in Lucca, Naples, or some other part of Italy, and in good health. It was stated that his debts amounted to \u00a3180,000, and his assets scarcely to \u00a3100. One of the witnesses, Mr. R. Abraham, said \u2014 \" I am a shareholder of the bank of which Mr. Maclean was a director. It is the Marylebone Bank. I knew after investigating the accounts of the bank in 1842, that he was in embarrassed circumstances. He had never any property of his"], [230, "224 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF s_A.D. 1847. own at all, but lived on the credulity and property of others. His debts at that time amounted to \u00a378,000, and there was only about \u00a3100 assets. The bank was insolvent through Mr. Maclean's mis conduct.\" As the time allowed sor Mr. Maclean's surrender had expired on the preceding day, he was outlawed in the usual form. The Witton estate, with the castle, park, and domain, the collieries, advowsons, and tythe rents were advertised for sale, by an order of the High Court of Chancery. On the 20th September, 1S50, Mrs. Maclean was was taking a drive in her carriage, at Castellamore, near Naples, when the Horses took Iright and ran away. The lady was consequently thrown from the carriage, and sustained such severe injuries that, after lingering a few hours, she expired. She was the daughter of the late General Maitland. 1847 (October). \u2014 During this month a number of workmen were engaged to restore such portions of the intersecting arches and columns extending round the interior of Durham Cathedral as had suffered injury either from decay or violence. In the progress of this restoration, it was found necessary to replace the shaft of a column which had been entirely removed. It was situated on the south-western corner of the south transept, close upon the entrance of the great staircase, leading to the top of the middle tower. They speedily became aware of the existence of a large hollow space within the thickness of the wall; and on opening out the hollow, they discovered a fire-place and its chimney, both of considerable magnitude. The chimney had found its way in the cloister ; its external aperture being carefully walled up, leaving nothing visible to mark its existence. For what purpose the fire-place had been intended, was a matter of doubt amongst ecclesiastics, and it was conjectured by some that it was used for the preparation of wafers or oblates, used in the celebration of the Eucharist ; one of the old laws addressed to priests, containing the following passage : \u2014 \" We commavnd thyt ye oblates, whych in y\u00b0 Holy Mysteries ye offer vnto God ye byke yovrselfs, or yovr sarvantes yn yovr syghte.\" October 21. \u2014 Another disastrous bank failure took place this day, the Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland Union Joint Stock Banking Company having announced to the public that, \" in consequence of the extreme difficulty in obtaining discounts, they were under the painful necessity of suspending payment.\" The bank was originally a private one, conducted by Messrs. Chapman and Co., and became a joint-stock establishment in the year 1836. The dividend declared by Mr. Chapman, the \" general director,\" had never been less than 10 per cent, per annum, besides an accu mulated guarantee fund of \u00a360,000. At the time of the failure there were about 500 proprietors, holding 30,480 shares of \u00a310 each, one half of which amount (152,400) was paid up. It had branches in Sunderland, North and South Shields, Durham, Aln wick, and Berwick, and as it issued its own notes to the amount of about \u00a375,000, the failure caused a great sensation throughout the district. A committee of the shareholders was appointed, who attempted to liquidate the liabilities of the establishment, but Mr."], [231, "A.D. 1847.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 225 Chapman, who decamped, and many other persons having refused to make any payment for that object, on the 25th of February, 1853, the bank was placed under the provisions of the Winding-up Act, and a call of \u00a320, made by the official managers, would, it was expected, pay off the liabilities of the concern, and possibly leave a considerable balance. 1847 (November 2). \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 41, the Right Rev. Dr. Riddell, Roman Catholic Bishop of the Northern District. The death of this estimable clergyman was caused by an attack of typhus fever, caught while assisting his clergy in the arduous duty of attending to the numerous poor belonging to his denomination who were then suffering under that malignant malady. The de ceased was a native of Northumberland, and connected with an ancient family, being the third son of the late Ralph Riddell, Esq., of Felton Park. He was in the prime of life, and apparently re markably hale, and the amiability of his disposition rendered him beloved by his friends and all who held intercourse with him. On November 8th, the remains of the deceased were conveyed from his residence, in Charlotte Square, to the chapel in Clayton Street, the procession being conducted with great ceremony. The body lay in state during the night, and the following day the interment took place, mass being performed by Cardinal Wiseman, assisted by Bishop Briggs, of York, Bishop Gillies, of Edinburgh, Bishop Wareing, of Northampton, and a great number of the clergy of the district. November 2. \u2014 A skiff match for \u00a3200, between two crack rowers Clasper and Maddison, took place on the river Tyne, from the Newcastle Bridge to Scotswood. After an exciting race \u2014 a foul having occurred on the previous day \u2014 Maddison won by nearly 100 yards. November 9. \u2014 The annual election of chief magistates for the boroughs in Northumberland and Durham took place, with the following result : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Stephen Lo wrey, esq., mayor (after two abortive elections, first of George Thomas Dunn and afterwards of Mr. Joseph Lamb) ; J. D. Weatherley, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 John Potts, esq. \u2014 Sunderland \u2014 Sir Hedworth Williamson, bart, Durham \u2014 Mark Story, esq. Stockton \u2014 John Eeles, esq. Morpeth Anthony Charlton, esq. Berwick \u2014 William Smith, esq., mayor; G. Ker Nicholson, esq., sheriff. November 20. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, John Brandling, esq., aged 74, third son of the late Charles Brandling, esq , of Gosforth, and for many years an alderman, both of the old and the reform Corporations of Newcastle. He served the office of mayor during 1832-3. November 28. \u2014 Died, in Sunderland Infirmary, aged 48, Mr. John Wilson Ewbank, R.S.A. The deceased gentleman was born in Darlington, and being intended for the Roman Catholic priest hood, he was sent when young to Ushaw College, from which he absconded, and when about fourteen years of age he apprenticed himself to Henry Coulson, decorative painter, in Newcastle, with VOL. III. f 1"], [232, "226 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1817. whom he rapidly showed gleams of surprising ability. Before the close of his apprenticeship he accompanied his master to Edinburgh, where he studied under Nasmyth, and his beautiful sketches, which were executed with extraordinary ease and rapidity, soon made his name famous in the northern capital. In 1823, when he painted \" George IV. at Edinburgh Castle \" and a \"View of Edinburgh from Inchkeith,\" his fame was at its zenith, and so many pupils flocked to his rooms that some years his profits exceeded \u00a33,000. But, unfortunately, as prosperity met him moral fortitude retreated, and he fell, day by day, into habits of dissipation, from which no efforts of his friends were ever able to extricate him. During the latter part of his life his house was literally the abode of want : a single chair was often the only article of furniture, and to defray the expense of a meal it was frequently necessary for him to throw off some hasty sketch, and sell it for anything obtainable at the moment. Any surplus, however small, went for drink, and his dissipated recklessness was the ultimate ruin of himself and family, and at length brought him to a premature grave. 1847 (December 19). \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, Mr. Thomas 0. Blackett, surveyor, author of a \" Treatise on the Spirit Level\" and other scientific works. His death was occasioned by an accident on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, on the 12th instant. The deceased had been on a visit to some friends, at Prudhoe, and passing along the line at that place, a train approached unheard, knocked him down, and his arm falling upon the rail, the whole train passed over it, nearly severing it from his body. December 25. \u2014 This being the day on which John Collingwood, esq., of Cornhill and Lowick estates, attained his majority, the happy event was celebrated by the tenantry and others dining together in the Collingwood Arms Inn, Mr. James Curry, Cornhill, in the chair, Mr. George Philips croupier. 1848 (January 18/ \u2014 Died, at Hurworth, aged 100, Mr. John Banks. January 19. \u2014 Died, at Whitworth Park, Durham, aged 72, Robert Eden Duncombe Shafto, esq., M.P. sor the city of Durham, from 1804 to 1806. February 1.\u2014 A melancholy occurence happened this morning off Cullercoats. As a coble, containing seven fishermen, viz., George Lisle and Robert Lisle, brothers ; Robert Lisle and George Lisle, sons of the above George Lisle ; Robert Clark, James Stocks, and Charles Pearson, was proceeding from Cullercoats to the several vessels lying in the offing, the boat was struck by a heavy sea, and the unfortunate men were thrown overboard and drowned, in the sight of their relatives and friends. The most lamentable fate was that of Stocks. He was a bold swimmer, and though he was washed off the coble bottom several times always got back to it. The last time he was on the coble he stripped off his jacket and waistcoat and prepared to swim ashore, as the coble had then approached the rocks. He was so near that his brother shouted to him, \" Jim, swim ashore.\" Stocks answered, \" I'm"], [233, "A.D. 1848.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 227 done, I'm done,\" and, after combating awhile with the sea, he hung his head and sunk. Much commiseration was felt in the district for the sufferers, who were well known, and respected by everybody. A subscription was afterwards set on foot for the relief of the families of the deceased men, and a very handsome sum was speedily collected, and distributed according to the separate wants of each. 1848 (February 2). \u2014 A man, named John Shirley, head game keeper to the Duke of Cleveland, whilst going his rounds near Raby Castle, came upon a gang of poachers. The poachers being disturbed in their nocturnal depredations offered a strenuous resistance, and the result was that a desperate encounter took place. Bludgeons, sticks, and guns were freely used on both sides, and in the end Shirley was shot. Tbe poachers afterwards kicked and beat him in such a manner that, after lingering a few hours, he expired. Several of the gang were afterwards apprehended, and two of them, named William Thompson and William Dowson, tried at the Durham Assizes, before Baron Alderson, on the 8th of March, and found guilty. Thompson was executed for the offence on the 25th ofthe same month, whilst Dowson was sentenced to transpor tation for life. February 4. \u2014 The foundation-stone of the new docks at Sunderland was laid with much ceremony by Mr. George Hudson, M.P. The event was celebrated with much rejoicing by the inhabitants, all places of business were closed, and the day was kept as an entire holiday. Shortly after one o'clock a procession, con sisting of the mayor, magistrates, and members of the corporation, the directors and shareholders of the company, and others, accom panied by music and banners, walked from the exchange buildings to the site of the docks, and the usual ceremony was then gone through, amidst enthusiastic cheers. In the evening a grand ball took place in the Athen\u00e6um, which was attended by upwards of 1,000 ladies and gentlemen. February. \u2014 As a scullerboat, containing seven boiler-builders, was crossing the Tyne, from North to South Shields, a steamer, called the Alice, which was going down the river without any lookout, ran down the boat, and precipitated the whole of the occupants into the water. The men struggled bravely for their lives, and the scene was most heart-rending ; but, notwithstanding that most strenuous efforts were used to save them, only four of them were saved, the remaining four meeting with a watery grave. Their names were Robert Hardy, Robert Gustard, George Fairless, and Robert Blenkinsop, the scullerman. Great indignation was felt at the apparent carelessness of the crew of the steamboat, and the opinion was very generrally expressed that had proper care been taken the accident would not have taken place ; and that, had the crew in charge of the steamboat acted in anything like a prompt manner, the whole of the poor fellows might have been rescued from their perilous position."], [234, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D 1848. 228 1848 (February 19/ \u2014 This morning, at ten minutes to twelve o'clock, an express train, arranged by Messrs. Smith and Sons, news agents, London, arrived at the Gateshead Station, with the financial statement of Lord John Russell and the debate in parlia ment of the evening previous. The distance from the metropolis to Gateshead having been performed in six hours and twenty minutes. February 22. \u2014 As a party of workmen were proceeding from Newcastle to one of the coffer-dams for the High Level Bridge, the boat, in which they were conveyed, from overcrowding, upset, and four of the men were drowned. Their names were Robert Potts, Shotton Clerk, Michael Jones, and R. Humble. March 7. \u2014 Died, in Blackett-street, Newcastle, in his 64th year, Mr. Thomas Miles Richardson, artist. Mr. Richardson began the world as a humble mechanic, and owed all after-success to inborn genius and undoubted taste. Like most beginners he had to struggle sor a livelihood, and taught drawing for several years. The talent of Richardson was of a high order in the art of land scape painting, for, though he occasionally painted figure pictures, his fame will rest on his landscapes, and reflect honour on his native town. Eminently skilled in lunar ariel perspective, no hand could, reduce nature more accurately. His style was bold, effective, and original. The subjects in which Richardson most excelled were sea pieces, coast scenes, and storms. Tynemouth, Cullercoats, and views near the mouth of the Tyne, were among his happiest efforts. His first remarkable picture was \" Newcastle from Gateshead Fell,\" which was bought by the Corporation of his native town for fifty guineas, and which won the highest admiration of Sir T. Lawrence, when on a visit at the Mansion House. His subsequent works were so exceedingly numerous as to render a list of them almost impracticable. His conception was always good, and his execution vigorous and true to nature. March 7. \u2014 As Mr. John Sinton, miller, Newcastle, was proceeding home, at the high end of Arthur's-hill, near Adrianople street, he was accosted by two women, who inquired if they were on the right road to Hexham. He told them they were, when three men instantly rushed upon him, throwing a handikerchief over his head and face, and robbed him of all the money he had upon him, four sovereigns and fifteen shillings of silver, together with a bunch of keys and a gold ring. The thieves were never discovered. March 24, \u2014 Died, at Sunderland, aged 103, Miss Ann Cristle. March 27. \u2014 An alarming fire was discovered this morning, about four o'clock, on tbe premises occupied by Messrs. Weather hilt and Marshall, drapers, Market-place, Barnard Castle. Mr. Weatherhilt was burnt to death, but Mr. Marshall, his partner, escaped unhurt by getting upon the roof of an adjoining house. A youth, named Loadman, who threw himself from one of the windows, was much hurt, and died shortly after. March 27. \u2014 Mr. James Mather was entertained at a public"], [235, "A.D. 1848.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 229 dinner, at the Golden Lion Hotel, South Shields, by the ship owners of the district, for his exertions in support of the navigation laws. About 100 gentlemen were present, the chair being filled by Robert Anderson, esq., and the vice-chairs by J. Clay, R. H. Bell, and J. R. Robinson, esqs. 1848 (March 27). \u2014 Died, in London, aged 47, Mr. John Jackson, an eminent wood engraver. The deceased was a native of Ovingham, and pupil ofthe celebrated Thomas Bewick, of New castle. In 1832 he became connected with Mr. Knight and the \" Penny Magazine,\" for which he executed many fine specimens of his art. 1838 he published a laborious monument of his own ability \"A History of Wood Engraving,\" the literary portion of which was written by another Northumbrian, Mr. W. A. Chatto, aud the treatise is one which will always be interesting to the admirers of art. March 30.\u2014 Died at Harbottle Castle, aged 81, Thomas Clennell, esq. The deceased was for many years chairman of the Northumberland Quarter Sessions, and during the French War, was Lieutenant-Colonel of the Newcastle Volunteers. He was many years an alderman of Newcastle and served the office of mayor in 1S02-3. March. \u2014 The payment of compulsory church-rates was the cause of much conflict in Darlington about this time. During a contest the church clock was stopped by the churchwardens, and the bells were not allowed to be rung on the Sunday. The result of the poll being adverse to the rate, a subscription, in the form of a voluntary rate, equivalent to about ld. in the pound, amounting to \u00a350, was agreed to be raised, for defraying the usual expenses ; but the sums received by the churchwardens only amounted to \u00a326; this they applied in paying some ofthe demands upon them, leaving others unpaid, and, among the rest, the sexton. That official, it appears, had held the office for 27 years, prevous to which his ancestors had filled the office of parish clerk for upwards of 160 years. He was allowed a salary of \u00a314, and for this sum he brought an action, in the Barnard Castle county court, against the churchwardens. The vestry minute, fixing the salary, was produced ; and he also proved the performance of his official duties. For the churchwardens, it was submitted that they were not liable, as they had not personally made any contract with the plaintiff. The case was eventually decided in favour of the defendants. April 5. \u2014 Died, at Barrington Hall, Robert Ingram Shafto, esq. April 6. \u2014 This day the inhabitants of North Shields held a general holiday, and great rejoicings took place, on the occasion of the opening of the New Custom House in that town. The boundary between the new port and that of Newcastle was fixed to be a supposed straight line, drawn from the east end of Jarrow Quay to the east end of Whitehill Point. The first business was transacted by Mr. Michael Spencer, who released a quantity of tobacco out of bond. Each hogshead was conveyed to its destina tion surmounted by a flag, and drawn by a horse decorated with"], [236, "230 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1848. ribbons. A procession of the inhabitants, with banners and music, passed through the principal streets to the Northumberland Arms, when the \" Port of Shields\" was toasted amidst loud cheering, and the rejoicings were wound up in the evening by a display of fire works. 1848 (April 24/ \u2014 A Polytechnic Exhibition, on behalf of the funds of the Natural History and Fine Arts Societies in Newcastle, was opened by a splendid promenade and soiree. The arrangements were almost similar to those made in 1840 (see page 128), and the collection on that occasion. Mr. W. G. Armstrong's newly-invented hydraulic-engine was used instead of a steam-engine for putting the various machinery in motion, and its novelty attracted much attention. The New Music Hall was also appropriated to the exhibition, where were collected the wonders of the age -the achievements of genius \u2014 the triumphs of science \u2014 the results of mind combined with experience. In the centre was a large fountain, the water from which ran into a canal, where minature boats were floating ; and besides which were a number of models, such as a diving-bell, with crane, Barker's water mill, a series of wheels, an overshot breast wheel and undershot, all contributed by Mr. G. Simpson, plumber, &c, 77, Blandford-stret, Newcastle ; the model of a pump, very ingenious, by Mr. Richard Ayre, Newcastle ; a distilling apparatus, by Mr. Gilpin, chemist ; a hydraulic fire escape, by Mr. Robert Hall, Newgate-street, Newcastle. &c, &c. The exhibition closed on the 2nd of October, when there had been 101,518 single admissions; 3,444 admissions to soirees; and 6,93 0 school children, &c. ; whilst the sale of season tickets had reached 4,439. This exhibition, however, was not so successful, in a pecuniary point of view, as might have been expected, the profits not having exceeded \u00a3150. May 2. \u2014 The Right Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle, accompanied by Mr. William Young, the senor churchwarden of St. Nicholas', and Mr. W. W. Gibson, the treasurer to the fund, waited upon the Rev. R. C. Coxe, A.M., at the Vicarage, and presented him with the sum of \u00a3450 as a voluntary \" Easter offering\" from the inhabitants of the town, a substantial proof of the estimation in which the worthy vicar was held. A similar offering had been presented in the three previous years, and on each occasion was subscribed in a few days. May 15. \u2014 Died, in the Infirmary, Newcastle, aged 54, John Dennis, alias '' Radical Jack.\" The early history of this eccentric individual is not known, but there is little doubt but that he belonged to a family of respectability, and that he had a University education. He was well known in the neihgbourhood as a hawker of cheap publications, and his ready wit, stentorian voice, and great command of language, made him an especial favourite with the multitude. For many years he hardly ever appeared to be sober, but by the persuasion of some who belonged to the teetotal society he was induced to take the pledge. Whether be kept his vow to the last is difficult to say ; but he certainly was apparently"], [237, "A.D. 1848.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 231 true to his engagement for a long time after he had entered into it, and, during this period, he acquired a cleanly and decent appearace, which was in striking contrast with his former aspect. 1848 (May). \u2014 The following are in the lists of patents obtained for May : \u2014 William George Armstrong, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, engineer, for an improved water pressure engine, sealed 1 1th May ; George Remington, of Warkworth, County of Northumberland, civil engineer, for improvements in locomotive engines and in marine and stationary engines, sealed 26th May ; Thomas Richard son, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, chemist, for improvements in the manufacture of manures, sealed 20th May. In each six months for enrolment. June 1. \u2014 Berwick-upon-Tweed became an English port, and its limits were appointed to extend from St. Abb's Head to the south side of the river Ain. June 1. \u2014 Died, at Darlington, aged 104, Mrs. Mary Brown. June 20. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Merry's gr h Chanticleer (Bumby), beating Executor, Dough, and eight others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Merry's Chanticleer walking over. June 21. \u2014 The boiler of a steam-tug, called the Neptune, belonging to Shields, burst when at sea, killing the master, Benjamin Baxter, and severley injuring others. July 18. \u2014 The ship Blenheim, of 1,500 tons burthen, was launched by Messrs. T. and W. Smith, of St. Peters's, near New castle, in the presence of a vast concourse of people including many of the beauty and fashion of the neighbourhood, as well as some distinguished foreigners. July 20. \u2014 A splendid service of plate, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, was presented to Matthew Plummer, esq., for his long and valuable services as the chairman ofthe Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Company, by the shareholders of that under taking, as a mark of their approbation of his gratuitous services. The presentation took place in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, in the presence of a numerous company of ladies and gentlemen, Matthew Bell, esq., M.P., presiding. July 30. \u2014 An alarming and destructive fire broke out this evening, in Ridley-court, Groat-market, Newcastle, in the bar of a spirit shop, kept by Mr. Carr. For some time all exertions to subdue the progress of the flames were ineffectual, and they soon consumed the entile contents of Mr. Carr's premises, and then broke into two shops on the ground floor, fronting the Groat Market, and occupied by Mr. Balls, cheesemonger, and Mr. Honeyman, grocer. These also were destroyed, and during a rash attempt to save a portion of Mr. Ball's stock the floor above gave way, and Elijah Galloway, foreman of the Newcastle fire-engine, was thrown down and burnt to death. Two others, Andrew Gilmore and James Scott, were seriously injured.

The building in which the fire broke out was originally erected for an assembly-room, for which purpose it was used till the completion of the rooms in Westgate street, in 1773. In 1798 the Literary and Philosophical Society took possession of it, the large room being used as a library, until July 1825, when the society also evacuated it for nobler premises. Tt was subsequently a school and lecture-room, in which latter capacity it had been used by Mr. Joseph Barker, a few hours before its destruction. The whole of Mr. Carr's furniture, stock, &c, was consumed, but he was fully insured in the Norwich Union. Mr Balls and Mr. Honeyman were uninsured. August 2. \u2014 At Durham Assizes, just after Mr. Justice Cresswell had sentenced an Irishmau, named Coyle, to seven years' transportation for house-breaking, Coyle pulled off one of his iron-shod \" brogues\" aud hurled it at the judge's head. The formidable missile, which might have put an abrupt termination to his lordship's judicial labours, struck him on the breast and inflicted no serious inijury. 1848. \u2014 This year, the ancient church of Wolsingham, with its embattled walls, underwent a thorough restoration, no part of the old building remaining except the tower The following curious deposition relates to an affray in this churchyard, in 1570: \u2014 \"The personal answer of Reginald Stowte, of Wolsingham, yeoman, alias bailman, aged about 30 years, to articles ex officio against him.

Shortly after six o'clock, his Grace the Duke of Northumberland arrived at the Castle, and soon after the members ofthe Antiquarian Society, to the number of nearly 100, sat down to a sumptuous entertainment, got up by Mr. Haigh, of the Assembly Rooms, in the style of two centuries ago. The decora tions of the apartments were in excellent taste, ancient arms and armour being hung upon the walls, the banners of Robert, Duke"], [239, "A.D. 1848.] REMARKABLE EVENTS 233 of Normandy (the sounder of the castle), Percy, Neville, Mowbray, Ratcliffe, Widdrington, Copeland, Clavering, Delaval, Dacre, Ogle, Umfreville, Bertram, Lumley, Hilton, Swinburne, Howard, Fenwick and Riddell, mingled with the arms of England, Northumbria, St. Cuthbert, and Newcastle, whilst gas introduced in the semblance of lighted torches spread a brilliant illumination over the scene. The Duke of Northumberland occupied the chair, supported by the Mayor of Newcastle (S. Lowrey, esq.), and the High Sheriff of the County (George Burdon, esq.), and Sir Charles Monck, bart., and J. H. Hinde, esq , presided over the side tables. A boar's head, fantastically dressed, and exhibiting every sign of the artist's skill, was placed in the centre of his grace's table, and the whole of the numerous delicacies were also remarkably appropriate and beautiful. PLATFORM OF THE \" KEEP\" OF THE CASTLE, NEWCASTLE-ON-TTNE. The appearance of the castle generally was of a holiday character, bunting and flags being displayed at every available spot, whilst the armour and other trophies of the warlike spirit of our \" rude fore fathers\" \u2014 in which this ancient structure is so rich \u2014 was exhibited in the most prominent manner, and afforded infinite enjoyment to the numerous and distinguished visitors present. The company entered the castle on the south side where they were ushered into the guard room, and two of his grace's pipers were in attendance, and played appropriate airs at intervals during the evening. The company was addressed, after the banquet, by the noble chairman, the Hon. H. T. Liddell, Mr. Ord. M.P., the Mayor of Newcastle, the High Sheriff of Northumberland, the Vicar of Newcastle, VOL.

Bruce, and others, and the interesting proceedings did not terminate until a late hour. On the following evening a promenade and lecture were given in the castle, for the purpose of allowing the public to examine this ancient and celebrated structure. Upwards of 500 persons were present, and Mr. Bruce's description of ancient Norman life and manners was listened to with great interest. 1848 (August 6/ \u2014 Died, at Broomhaugh, near Hexham, aged 80, Mr. John Shield, formerly an extensive wholesale grocer in New castle. Mr. Shield possessed poetic powers of a high order, and while many of his local songs have considerable excellence for their humour and imagination, some of his graver pieces were deservedly admired for their elegance and sweetness. Perhaps his best comic production was the song of ''My Lord Size,\" written on the accidental fall into the river Tyne of Mr. Baron Graham, and of a serious character his song of \" Poor Tom, the Blind Boy,\" and the verses he addressed to Greathead, one of the inventors of the life boat, prove Mr. Shield's versatile talent, and give some idea of the eminence to which he might have aspired in that branch of literature. August 12. \u2014 Died, at Tapton House, Staffordshire, aged 67, Mr. George Stephenson, Civil Engineer, K.L , F.G.S. \u2014 a rare example ot the rise of humble virtue, talent, and industry, to the most envied station in society. The deceased was born at Wylam, situated on the Tyne, about nine miles west of Newcastle, where his father was employed as an ordinary workman, in 1781 ; he was only six or seven years of age when he was sent down the pit as a \" trapper,\" and in this Cimmerian darkness were the early years of George Stephenson spent. He was afterwards a \" picker\" at Wylam, at a wage of 4s. or 5s. a week. He then went to Callerton Pit, where he got promoted to the post of driver of a gin. Soon afterwards he was appointed to the situation of engineman, at a wage of 10s. a-week. While at Callerton he set his affections upon a Miss Hindmarsh, the daughter of a farmer in the neighbourhood. But as George was yet only a poor working man, he was not con sidered a suitable match. He was, however, resolved to be married, and, as the mistress would not have him, he offered himself to the servant, and was accepted. He married her, she proved a good wife, and the celebrated Robert Stephenson, civil engineer, and formerly M.P. for Whitby, but now deceased, was the is^ue of the union. Shortly after Robert's birth she died, and in a tew years after George again offered himself to Miss Hindmarsh, and this time he was accepted. The second marriage was a prosperous one, and the pair lived long and happily together. In 1S04 he removed to Killingworth, having been engaged as brakesman at 12s. a-week, on which event he declared, on coming out of the pay-office, that he was \" made a man for life.\" Not long after he succeeded in discovering and removing a defect in a new steam-"], [241, "A.D. 1848.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 235 engine, which had eluded the skill of all the engineers in the neighbourhood, and his success in bringing the engine into working order was so complete that he was in a short time entrusted with the entire management of the machinery belonging to the colliery. We may bere mention an interesting circumstance in Stephenson's career while working as brakesman at Killingworth Pit. There were three brakesmen, who took the \"night shift\" by turns. The night shift lasted from eight to ten hours, and as there was little work to be done, the brakesman's time hung heavy on his hands. Stephenson, however, always regarded time as precious, and care- fully turned every minute to account. During these night shifts he took his first lessons in arithmetic. When he had worked his sums on a slate he sent them off next morning to a schoolmaster to correct, who in turn sent him new questions to answer For this service the eager scholar paid his master the humble tribute of fourpence a week. The rest of his time he occupied in cleaning the pitmens' clocks and watches, mending shoes, and last-making. Among the other of his works was a sun dial, still fixed over the door of the house he lived in at Killingworth ; and to the last day of his life he felt a pride at the sight of that sun dial Not long before his death, while surveying the line of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, he drove a professional freind somewhat out of his way to have an admiring look at the dial. From the oft-recurr- ing explosions of gas in mines, of which he had been a frequent witness, his attention was drawn to the subject ; and at the very time Sir Humphrey Davy was pursuing his investigations, and before that philosopher had come to any determination upon it, Mr. Stephenson discovered, by independent experiments, that explosive mixtures will not pass through small apertures or tubes. His first safety-lamp was made by Mr. Hogg, a tinsmith in Newcastle, and was tried at Killingworth Colliery, 21st October, 1815, some days antecedent to Sir Humphrey Davy's earliest announcement of the lamp which bears his name. Both gentlemen, accordingly, had their partisans. Sir Humphrey was feasted in Newcastle, and honoured with a magnificent testimonial ; and Mr Stephenson's friends rewarded his exertions by a gift of \u00a31,000, which, with a silver tankard, were presented to him in January, 1818, ata dinner in the Assembly Rooms, at which C. J. Brandling, esq., presided. The first locomotive engine constructed by Stephenson was tried on the 25th of July, 1814, and although it is impossible to award him all the praise due to the invention of that wonderful machine, which has revolutionised all former ideas of commercial intercourse, has annihilated distance, and everywhere become the herald of enlightenment and civilization ; it cannot be doubted that his improvements in its manufacture have placed his name in immortal connexion with it. Years passed by and George Stephenson became a prosperous man. His upright and manly character, and his devoted attention to his profession, gained him many and powerful freinds. He earned the confidence of all with whom he came in contact. He was straightforward and"], [242, "236 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1848. openhearted, hardworking, and a zealous self-cultivator, always observant, always improving, always advancing. With the assistance of his son he constructed the London and Birmingham, the Manchester and Leeds, and many other railways, not only in England but in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, and his name, as an engineer, is as wide in its extent as it probably will be unlimited in its duration. Mr. Stephenson was to the last a man of plain and unassuming manners, neither ashamed of his humble origin nor forgetful of his early associates, and a few months before his death, in answer to a gentleman who was desirious of knowing what honorary initials he was entitled to use, he replied that many honours had been offered him, at home and abroad, which he had declined to accept, and almost the only title which he held and certainly the one of which he was most proud was that of \" President of the Birmingham Mechanics' Institute.\" In August, 1845, the Midland, the York and North Midland, the Newcastle and Darlington, and the Newcastle and Berwick Railway Companies severally voted the sum of \u00a32,000, to be expended in the purchase of a service of plate for Mr. Stephenson, and in the erection of his statue on the High Level Bridge across the Tyne. It is little to the credit of these great companies that their resolu tions were never carried out. In a speech delivered in Newcastle, June 18, 1844, Mr. Stephenson said: \u2014 \" The first locomotive that I made was at Killingworth Colliery, and with Lord Ravensworth's money. That engine was made 32 years ago, and we called it ' My Lord.' I said to my friends that there was no limit to the speed of such an engine, provided the works could be made to stand. In this respect great perfection has been reached, and, in consequence, a very high velocity has been attained. In .what has been done under my management the merit is only in part my own. I have been most ably seconded and assisted by my son. In the earlier period of my career, and when he was a little boy, I saw how deficient I was in education, and made up my mind that he should not labour under the same defect, but that I would put him to a good school and give him a liberal training. Being, however, a poor man, how do you think I managed ? I betook myself to mending my neighbours' clocks and watches at night, after my daily labour was done, and thus I procured the means of educating my son. He became my assistant and my companion. He got an appointment as under viewer, and at nights we worked together at our engineering. I got leave to go from Killingworth to lay down a railway at Hetton, and next to Darlington, and after that I went to Liverpool, to plan a line to Manchester. I there pledged myself to attain a speed often miles an hour. I said I had no doubt the locomotive might be made to go much fastei, but we had better he moderate at the beginning. The directors said I was quite right, for if when they went to Parliament I talked of going at a greater rate then ten miles an hour I would put a 'cross on the concern.' It was not an easy task for me to keep the engine down to ten miles an hour, but it had to be done, and I did my best. I had to"], [243, "A.D. 1848.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 237 place myself into that most unpleasant of all positions \u2014 the witness-box of a Parliamentary Committee. Some one inquired if I was a foreigner, and another said I was mad. But I put up with every rebuff, and went on with my plans, determined not to be put down. Assistance gradually increased \u2014 improvements were made every day \u2014 and to-day a train which started from London in the morning has brought me iu the afternoon to my native soil, and enabled me to take my place in this room, and to see around me many happy faces, which I have great pleasure in looking on.\" 1848 (August 15). \u2014 An explosion took place in the West Pit, Murton Colliery, near South Hetton, the property of Messrs. Braddyll and Co,, when sixteen men and boys were killed, and several others much hurt. Upwards of one hundred persons were in the mine at the time, and but for the presence of mind of one of the work men, who was able to lead the others to a shaft, the whole would have been suffocated. August 29. \u2014 The great and important desideratum the opening of a railway communication between Newcastle and Gateshead, by a line of rails over the temporary scaffolding at the High Level Bridge, was accomplished this day. About half-past one o'clock, Mr. Hudson, M.P., and his son, accompanied by a number of other gentlemen, arrived from Sunderland, and were received at the Gateshead Station by the Right Worshipful the Mayor of New castle, the Mayor of Gateshead, and a numerous body of gentlemen. A train, consisting of eight carriages, was drawn alongside the platform, where an engine, gaily decorated with flags, was waiting to take it across. Precisely at half-past two the train proceeded, amidst the firing of cannon and the cheers of the assembled multi tude. As the train passed slowly and steadily over the approches to the bridge, the anxiety of the immense body of spectators, whose eyes were watching every movement, seemed to be most intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet it was not viewed without some degree of fear, not only from the lofty position of the train and its occupants, but from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It appeared, from the absence of the usual noise, rather like an aerial flight than the rattling and resistless sweep of the iron horse, Onward it came, steadily and calmly, like a giant in his strength, safely traversing the temporary bridge, and on reaching the north side was received with a burst of cheers from the immense assemblage and a salute from the castle guns. After changing the engine, the train was conveyed across the magnificent arch which spans the foot of Dean street to the Manors Station, where it was again welcomed by the firing of cannon and renewed cheers. The company having alighted, the Right Worshipful the Mayor, accompanied by Mr. Hudson and other gentlemen, proceeded to the Queen's Head Inn, where they sat down to a splendid collation, the mayor presiding, Captain Weatherley in the vice-chair. After the repast the healths of Mr. Hudson and his staff, the Mayor and Corporation of Newcastle, Messrs. Hawks and Crawshay, Mr. Robert"], [244, "238 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1848. Stephenson, Mrs. Hudson, &c, &c, were drank with enthusiasm, and the company separated, highly gratified with the proceedings of the day. 1848 (August 31 j. \u2014 An awful instance of sudden death occurred at the Queen's Head Inn, Newcastle, this evening. Major John Philipotts, son of the Bishop of Exeter, arrived by the train from Carlisle, having been paying a visit to the Rev. Mr. Anderson, of Keswick. The gallant gentleman, shortly after his arrival, proceeded to his room to dress, when it was supposed that a blood-vessel had suddenly burst, he rushed to the door, when he fell. Surgical aid was immediately called, but he was sound to be dead. September 17. \u2014 St. John's Church, Newcastle, after under going considerable alteration, was re-opened for divine service. Sermons were preached, in the morning by the Rev. Leonard Shaftoe Orde, M.A., incumbent of Lucker ; and in the afternoon by the Rev. Richard Clayton, when collections were made, amounting to \u00a340. In taking down the chancel, the piscina of the church and several inscribed stones were found by the workmen, and were presented to the Society of Antiquaries. September 20. \u2014 Jenny Lind, \"The Swedish Nightingale,\" appeared in the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, in the opera of \" La Som nambula,\" and, notwithstanding the price of admission, the theatre was crowded in every part : the boxes as well as the pit being filled by one of the most numerous and splendid assemblages of the haut ton of the district that had ever been witnessed. The prices of admission were\u2014 dress boxes, \u00a31 11s. 6d, ; upper boxes and pit, \u00a31 ls. ; and gallery, 10s. 6d. The receipts were upwards of \u00a31,100. September 24. \u2014 Died, near Durham, very suddenly, aged 59, Major James Weymss. chief constable of the Durham Rural Police. November 7, Major G. F. White was appointed chief constable. October 18. \u2014 The shareholders of the Whittle Dean Water Company, Newcastle, and other friends, dined together this evening at the Queen's Head Inn, to celebrate the completion of the works. Mr. Alderman Potter presided, and the Mayor of Newcastle and several other gentlemen, who had, during the day, inspected the reservoirs at Whittle Dean (44 acres in extent), expressed their satisfaction and delight at what they had witnessed. October 29. \u2014 A serious and fatal accident occured this evening on the Yoik and Newcastle Railway, between Brockley Whins and Washington Station, by the collision of the mail train from London with a special train of workmen, who had been repairing the line, and who had carelessly allowed their engine to run out of water. Three of the workmen were killed on the spot, and several persons in both the trains were severely injured. The names of the unfortunate sufferers were John Ross, Joseph Hutchinson, and Robert Raffles.

The group consisted of two men, two women, and a child, belonging to a tribe called Bosjesmans. Their diminutive forms and strange language excited much astonishment, and certainly they presented as strange a group of beings, having affinity to the human race, as ever was seen. November 20. \u2014 In the course of deepening the river Tyne, Mr. Holt, the diver, under the directions of Mr. Brooks, the river engineer, was making his observations, when he discovered part of a huge trunk of an oak tree, lying embedded in the Cockraw Sands, near Wallsend. It was soon extricated and conveyed to the New Quay. It was found to measure 17 feet in circumference at one part, and about 35 feet in length. The greater part of it was quite sound, and a portion was applied for by the architect of the Coal Exchange, London, and used by him in forming the beautifully tessellated floor of that building. December 4. \u2014 The estate of Collingwood House, in the parishes of Whittingham and Alnham, Northumberland, was sold by auction, in London, to the Hon. H. T. Liddell (now Lord Ravensworth), for \u00a360,000. The estate comprised 1,965 acres, and the yearly rent amounted to \u00a32,045. December 19. \u2014 A most singular accident occurred at Trimdon Colliery A little boy, nephew of a pitmen, named Dinning, had been sent for some milk, and on carrying it home he fell and spilled it , on informing his uncle of the accident, the latter threw a bag of gunpowder at the boy's head, and, the bag bursting by the violence of the blow, a portion of the contents went into the fire, and the whole exploded. The house was almost completely destroyed. The boy, as well as another child, was killed, and the other inmates were sadly burnt. December 20. \u2014 Died, at Bournemouth, Hants, aged 56, Thomas Wentworth Beaumont, esq., of Bywell Hall, Northumberland, and Bretton Park, Yorkshire. Mr. Beaumont, from the extent of his landed property, and the value of his mineral pessessions, was one ol the richest commoners in England. He represented the county of Northumberland for several years, and was engaged in more than one electioneering contest. Mr. Beaumont was a tory, and a member ofthe Pitt Club in early life, but from 1820 he was generally considered an \" Advanced Liberal,\" and his munificent generosity of disposition, and frankness of manner, secured him the attachment of a very numerous body of friends. He was one of the chief originators of the \" Westminster Review,\" to which it was understood he contributed a number of papers,"], [246, "240 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a D. 1848. Mr. Beaumont was succeeded by his eldest son Mr. Wentworth Blackett Beaumont, who was, at his father's death, approaching his majority. 1848 (December 30).\u2014 Died, at Brussels, aged 74, Robert William Brandling, esq., of Low Gosforth, Northumberland. In 1835, the deceased brought before the public the project of a railway to connect Newcastle with South Shields and Sunderland. The line, which was known as the Brandling Junction Railway until its amalgamation with the Newcastle and Darlington Company, proved one of the most important in the district. Mr. Brandling was sor many years an active county magistrate, and was well known and respected by all classes with whom he came in contact. January 16th, 1849, his remains arrived at Newcastle, and were interred on the same day at Gosforth. December. \u2014 The magnificent chapel at Ushaw College, dedicated to St. Cuthbert, was finally opened, the Right Reverend William Hogarth, bishop of the northern district, celebrating high pontifical mass ; the opening sermon being preached by the Right Reverend Nicholas Wiseman (afterwards Cardinal). The edifice consists of an ante-chapel, a choir and a sanctuary, arranged after the models of the collegiate chapels at Oxford. Its exterior is simple in design, and well suited to its elevated situation. A niche in the west gable contains an image of St. Cuthbert, standing, and holding a gilt staff in his hand ; and on each side of the west window is a canopied niche, intended for images of St Peter and St. Paul. On the north side of the chapel, the wall is strengthened by buttresses, which overarch the roof of the cloister, and terminate between the north windows of the choir. The bell-turret, at the north-east angle, is seventy feet high ; but it is contemplated to erect a lofty campanile tower, containing a full chime of bells, on the north side of the chapel. The whole of the windows are of coloured glass, the largest of which contains the life of St. Cuthbert. He is depicted in the centre light with his mitre and pastoral staff, holding the head of St, Oswald in his hand ; and the Eternal Father is re presented above as receiving his soul. December 30. \u2014 Died, at Newcastle, aged 51, James Reid, esq., son of Christian Ker Reid, goldsmith. The deceased commenced at an early period of life as a merchant, in which profession he displayed great ability and enterprize. He was the first to give an impulse to the trade between Newcastle and Hamburgh, and, as early as 1823-4, established a regular communication between the two ports. He took an active part, and was mainly instru mental, in procuring a repeal of the duty on sea borne coal, thus opening out a market for the immense quantity of small coal lying as useless at every colliery. Having introduced the coals of the Pelton Colliery to the London Chartered Gas Company, to which Mr. Reid was agent, the directors so highly approved of the quality of the coal that, in order to secure a continuous supply, Mr. Reid was"], [247, "A.D. 1849.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 241 encouraged to purchase the interests of the lessees. After a pro tracted negotiation, in which much tacfand ability were required, the whole was arranged by Mr. Reid, the sum paid being \u00a380,000. Mr. Reid was appointed consul for Belgium, for the port of Newcastle, on the 20th of August, 1832, after the separation of Belgium from Holland, the duties of which he continued to perform till his death. The urbanity and kindness of manner and generosity of disposition, approaching to a fault, procured for Mr. Reid the respect and goodwill of a large circle of friends amongst all classes of society. 1849 (January 3). \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 68, James Archbold, esq., an alderman and magistrate of that town. Mr. Archbold served the office of mayor in 1846-7. He left a large fortune, and amongst other legacies to charitable objects, he devised \u00a34,500 to found an hospital for twelve poor widows, but the statute of mort main rendered that portion of his will a nullity. A very elegant mural monument to the memory of Mr. Archbold has been erected in St. Nicholas' Church, Newcastle. January 19. \u2014 About half-past four o'clock this morning a most destructive fire broke out in Mr. Henry Angus's coach manu factory, Bigg-market, Newcastle, the whole of which, in the space of two hours, was entirely destroyed, together with some houses and shops and small work sheds adjacent. The manufactory had been substantially built after the still more extensive fire which occured on the same site on the 29th January, 1830, and the damage amounted to several thousand pounds. An attempt was made by the Corporation to take advantage of this opportunity for continuing Grainger street to the Central Railway Station. Although the design was at that time abandoned, it is now being carried out. January 20. \u2014 Died, at Inspruck, aged 84, General Baron Swin burne, Chamberlain of the Emperor of Austria, K.M.T., &c. The deceased was the last surviving brother of Sir John E. Swinburne,. bart., of Capheaton. Capheaton mansion was anciently in the castle form, and according to Leiand, who calls it \" Huttun,\" was \" a fair castle, in the midste of Northumberlande, as in the bredthe of it.\" The present house was erected by the first Sir John Swinburne immediately after the restoration.

The library con tains one of the most extensive and best chosen collections in the north of England ; it is particularly rich in Spanish and French books. The pleasure grounds are laid out in a tasteful manner, and the clumps of which are scattered over the lands render the scene singularly beautiful. Immediately in front of the village is an artifical lake, comprehending, with its islands, 40 or 50 acres, made by Sir John, the fourth baronet, but since much enlarged and improved ; a sailor is regularly kept for the management of the vessels upon this beautiful piece of water. In the former part of the last century, some labourers, who were employed to make a cast for a hedge near the mansion, found many Roman antiquities ; VOL. III.

A gamekeeper, under the Duke of Cleveland, named May, was found shot in the back part of the head. May had given evidence against Thompson and Dowson, at the previous Durham Assizes, for the murder of the watcher, named Shirley, in February, 1848, and it was supposed that he had been murdered by some of their friends. Shortly afterwards, three men, named Neasham, Simpson, and Peverley, were apprehended, when they mutually criminated each other, and, on the 28th July, Neasham was tried for the murder, at Durham, before Mr. Justice Pattison, the others giving evidence against him. He was, however, acquitted. February 18.\u2014 A splendid vessel which was about being launched from the building yard of Mr. H. Carr, Hylton Ferry, Sunderland, was entirely destroyed by fire. The workshops in the yard were also consumed, as well as some timber in the adjoining premises, and the total damage was upwards of \u00a32,000. February 20. \u2014 At a meeting of the York. Newcastle, and Berwick Railway Company, at York, Mr. Prance, of the Stock Exchange, brought before the shareholders a question as to the sale of certain shares made by the chairman, Mr. Hudson, to the company, and moved for a committee to investigate the matter. Mr. Hudson avowed the transaction, expressing his readiness to submit his conduct to the fullest inquiry. A report was soon afterwards presented to the shareholders, condemning the conduct of Mr. Hudson, and at a meeting held at York on the 14th of May, another committee, consisting of Mr. McLaren, of Edinburgh ; Mr. Leechman, of Glasgow ; Mr. Kipling, of Darlington ; Mr. John Shield and Mr. Philipson, of Newcastle ; Mr. Love, of London ; and Mr. Meek, of York, was appointed to investigate the whole affairs of the company. At this meeting a letter was read from Mr. Hudson resigning the chairmanship. The first report of the committee was not of an important nature, but the second excited an extraordinary sensation. The committee stated that Mr. Hudson, although entitled to only 936 shares in the Newcastle and Berwick Company, had secretly taken and afterwards sold for his own benefit 10,984, the committee estimating the profit of this \" flagrant abuse of the confidence reposed in him,\" at \u00a3145,000. With respect to the Brandling Junction Shares, it appeared that his fellow directors had made Mr. Hudson a present of 2,000 shares, at a time when they were at a premium of \u00a321 each, being equivalent to a bonus of \u00a342,000. It was further stated that in January, 1845, Mr. Hudson purchased 10,000 tons of iron, on his own account, at \u00a36 10s. per ton, and sold 7,000 tons of his purchase to the company, within a few days, at \u00a312 per ton, realizing a profit of \u00a338,500. As to the payments for land it was shown that Mr. Hudson took cheques, in 1845, for \u00a337,350, of which sum he retained \u00a326,000 until the cmmittee"], [249, "A.D. 1849.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 243 was appointed when he restored it to the company. In like manner the construction account was overcharged to the extent of \u00a340,000 which Mr. Hudson also repaid with interest. On the Great North of England purchase account Mr. Hudson was a debtor to the company for \u00a326,854 which he likewise returned. It was also discovered that, in order to keep up large dividends, and \" to make things pleasant,\" the accounts of the company had been systematically falsified from the first existence of the railway to the extent of \u00a3121,925, partly by absorption of capital into the traffic account, and partly by overstating the actual traffic. Lastly, the committee proved that \u00a341,047, of the company's funds had been applied, without its consent, in the purchase of Sunder land Dock Shares, which was also repaid. An agreement was finally made between Mr. Hudson and the company, on the 8th January, 1850, by which, ou an additional payment of \u00a350,000, the company relinquished all further claim upon him. 1849 (February 20/ \u2014 Died at Minsteracres, aged 75, George Silvertop, esq. The deceased, like most Roman Catholic gentle men of the last century, was educated at Douay, but returned to this country at the outbreak of the French Revolution He succeeded to his paternal estates in 1814. In the same year he visited Napoleon, then at Elba, and printed an acoount of his interview with the Emperor which was received with great approbation. He was subequently selected by Lord Liverpool as the medium of private communication between Great BritaiD and the Holy See, in which capacity he acquitted himself with much address. Mr. Silvertop was appointed High Sheriff of Northumberland, in 1830, and was the first Roman Catholic who had filled that office since the reign of James II. He was the first to notice and to foster the genius of the celebrated sculptor Lough, who was born near Minsteracres, and his purse was ever open to merit struggling with difficulty or misfortune. March 26. \u2014 This morning while the fishing boats belonging to the village of Cullercoats were at sea they discovered something floating of uncommon length and of silvery and dazzling bright ness. It proved to be a fish of the Gymmetrus genus of which there are few of the species known. It was 12 feet 5 inches long, 13 inches in depth, and 3 inches thick, with a crest about 14 inches in height. The fish was exhibited at Tynemouth, North and South Shields, and Newcastle, and was afterwards shown in London, where it attracted much attention. It is now in the Museum of the Natural History Society, Newcastle. April 3. \u2014 A \"gentleman\" and '' lady\" drove up in a gig to the door of the Fulwell Inn, near Sunderland. The gentleman intro duced himself as the \"Laird o' Banaff,\" and possessed of estates in the North of Scotland, yielding rental to the amount of \u00a37,000 per annum. He displayed a large bundle of notes and invited the landlord to dine with him and to send for all the respectable farmers and tradesmen around for the same purpose, whilst the workmen and others in the kitchen were regaled with brandy."], [250, "244 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D 1849. The laird and lady remained enjoying themselves for two days, when the gentleman and his host rode out together to Cleadon, where the latter, according to the custom of landlords from home, treated his friend. Some people in the house, however, began to think they had seen the laird before, and, finding he was observed, he hastily mounted his horse and galloped back to Fulwell, followed by the landlord. Whilst the party were at supper the constable of Cleadon entered and arrested the laird, in the Queen's name, on a charge of having fraudulently taken away a horse and gig from a stable keeper at Newcastle. The bundle of notes proved to be those ofthe \"Bank of Elegance,\" and their pos sessor, whose name was Davison, the son of a butcher in South Shields, was proved to be a deserter from the 63rd Regiment. He was accordingly removed to Newcastle Gaol. The \"lady\" was a servant of good reputation whom he bad induced, by false representations, to leave a respectable situation. 1849 (April 7/ \u2014 A serious accident occurred in the river Tyne, near Walker, by which two men, named Moore and Wear, and a boy, named Robert Watson, were drowned. It appeared that the unfortunate sufferers were employed at Mr. Potter's coke and brick works, at Willington, and had proceeded in a boat to Walker where they took in a quantity of iron. On their return they got into the wake of a steamer, the swell from which was so great that, in tacking, the sail \"jibed,\" and in their efforts to right the boat it swamped and went down. April 14. \u2014 A melancholy accident occured at Shields by which five men were drowned. It appeared that the men were daily in the custom of passing and repassing from a vessel, called the Havering, to the shore in a boat to their meals, &c, in gangs of from fourteen to sixteen, when by some mismanagement, the boat was upset, immersing the entire party in the river. The most active and praiseworthy efforts were made to save the men, but it is to be regretted that five of them sank to rise no more. Their names were John Wade, John Kent, John Juggings, William Keldey, and John Anderson. April 16. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning in the library of John Adamson, esq., Westgate-street, Newcastle. The fire had arisen from the igniting of a beam in the chimney, and nearly 2,000 valuable books, prints, and MSS., were destroyed before the flames could be got under. Prior to this disaster Mr. Adamson possessed the finest collection of Portuguese literature in the kingdom. May 1. \u2014 A man, named William Hornsby, died at Halt whistle under suspicious circumstances, and the conduct of his wife having been noticed as somewhat singular, an examination of the body took place when it became apparent that he had died from the effects of arsenic. The woman was tried for murder at the next assizes, before Mr. Justice Wightmen, but she was acquitted. May 27. \u2014 A fire of a most terrific nature occurred at Shawdon Hall, near Alnwick, the seat of Wilham Pawson, esq. The"], [251, "A.D. 1849.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 245 hall itself was preserved, but all the out-buildings were entirely destroyed. The damage was estimated at upwards of \u00a33,000. The intensity of the heat may be calculated by the fact that the lead poured down from the roof like water, and the bell of the turret clock, which had been brought from the monastery at Alnmouth, in the reign of Henry VIII., was melted in the con flagration. It was formerly the seat of James Hargrave, esq., who was high sheriff of Northumberland in 1738 ; and about the year 1778, it came into the possession of his son, the late William Hargrave, esq., who was also high sheriff of the county in 1783. He received his academical education at St. John's College, Cam bridge, where, as his noble friend and contemporary, the late Duke of Northumberland, expressed himself, \" he was distinguished for superior strength of understanding and benevolence of heart/' This character might justly be applied to him through life ; modest and firm in manners, correct in judgment, and polished in conver sation, he afforded a fine specimen of the higher order of English country gentlemen. His knowledge of the laws were happily applied in the discharge of his magisterial duties ; and his bene volence, though secreted, was unbounded. He died in 1817, aged 81 years. The impression made by his loss was such, that every person in the neighbourhood, who could provide himself, appeared iu mourning at the parish church of Whittinghain on the Sunday after his decease. Previous to his father's death, he married Catherine, third daughter and co-heiress of Samuel Shields, esq., of Newcastle. But the estates, in consequence of the death of George Hargrave Pawson, are possessed by his brother, W. J. Pawson, esq., second cousin to William Hargrave, esq. Shawdon stands on the north side of the road leading from Glanton to Alnwick. The mansion house is a large and elegant building, adorned with fine extensive woods and pleasure grounds. Two urns of extraordinary pottery were some years ago discovered neai this place. During the shrievalty of Sir Thomas Swinburn, in 1628, the first fruits of the vicarage of Whittingham, were assessed at \u00a35, and levied accordingly ; the sum afterwards being paid to Sir Thomas. 1849 (June 5). \u2014 About seven o'clock this morning one of those sudden and disastrous explosions which, although of too frequent occurence in this district, seem, nevertheless, contingent on the hazardous occupation of the coal miner, took place at Hebburn Colliery, about six miles from Newcastle. About 100 men were at work at the time of the accident, but the effects of the explosion were confined to the north-western portion of the mine, where thirty-four men and boys were employed, all of whom, with but one exception, were killed. The explosion had been tremendous, and the bodies were mutilated in a manner never witnessed before, but this, it was believed, arose from the ignition of a quantity of gunpowder, which had been placed near the spot by one of the workmen on the previous day. June 7. \u2014 The Mayor of Gateshead, Mr. Hawks, one of the firm of Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay, and Co., the contractors for"], [252, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1849. 246 the iron work of the High Level Bridge across the Tyne, at Newcastle, drove the last key of that splendid and stupendous structure into its place, thereby closing the arches, in the presence of a numerous party. Mr. Hosking, superintendent of Messrs. Hawks and Crawshay's works, examined what the Mayor had done, and announced that the key was well driven and an excellent fit. His worship and a number of friends dined together at Miss Murray's, Half Moon Inn, to commemorate the occasion, and the men working on the bridge were plentifully regaled with strong ale. August 14th, the bridge was opened without any ceremony, but was not brought into ordinary use until the 4th February, 1 850. The structure consists of six arches, each having a span of 125 feet, with two curved approaches 66 feet in length, the whole being formed of cast iron pillars and arches, from designs by Robert Stephenson. The contract for the metal work was taken by Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay, and Co., for \u00a3112,000, and they were assisted in completing it by Messrs. Losh, Wilson, and Bell, who executed the approches, and by Messrs. Abbot and Co., who cast the arches. The total weight of iron employed was 5,050 tons. The length of the viaduct 1,337 feet, length of waterway 512 feet, height from high water mark to the line of railway 112 feet, and to the carriage-way 85 feet. The erection of the bridge and viaducts required the removal of 655 families in Newcastle and 130 in Gateshead, which necessarily added much to the expense of the undertaking, which was as follows : \u2014 Cost of bridge, \u00a3243,000; approaches, \u00a3113,153; land and compensa tion, \u00a3135,000 ; total, \u00a3491,153. 1849 (June 20/ \u2014 Died, at Fowberry Tower, aged 75, Matthew Culley, esq., the iast of the celebrated Northumbrian agriculturists of that name. A few weeks before his death Mr. Culley purchased Horton estate from Earl Grey for \u00a346,000, He was succeeded in his large property by his nephew, George Darling, esq., of Hetton House. June25. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Nor thumberland Plate was won by Mr. B. Eddison's b c John Cosser (Charlton), beating Malton, Snowstorm, and nine others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Merry's gr h Chanticleer ( Marlowe). In order to avoid a walk over Mr. 8. Ogle's ch f Camphine ran behind. Any odds upon Chanticleer. The above prize, which was in the form of an elegant candelabrum, was displayed, as usual, in front of the Grand Stand. It was of massive construction, of bright and frosted silver, and 31 inches in height. The base forms a tripod, on which are three couchant horses, supporting the same number of shields. The stem was of rich acanthus leaves, from which sprung six branches for lights, surmounted by a chaste and beautiful figure of Victory, holding a garland of laurels. It was manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, Grey street, Newcastle. June 29. \u2014 Died, at Kenton, aged 104, Mr. Selby Robson. The deceased was the father of eighteen children, sixty-nine"], [253, "A.D. 1849.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 247 graud-children, fifty-eight great grand-children, and two great great grand-children, making a total of 147 descendants. 1849 (July). \u2014 Whilst workmen were engaged in sinking Seaton and Seaham Colliery they found a live toad embedded in the solid limestone rock, 183 feet from the surface. The reptile, which was of a very curious shape, died soon after it was extricated, and was afterwards exhibited at Seaham, by Mr. Thomas Chilton, innkeeper. July 2. \u2014 Cholera broke out with most fatal virulence at North Shields, and from this date to November 1 3th there were 315 deaths in Tynemouth Union from that disease alone. July 10. \u2014 At the Thames Regatta the grand champiou prize for four-oared boats was won by the St. Agnes, of Newcastle, the crew of which consisted of R. and H. Clasper, of Newcastle, and R and T. Coombes, of London. July 28. \u2014 Whilst a carpenter, named John Smith, of New castle, was at work on the High Level Bridge, he stepped upon a loose plank, which immediately canted over, and he was thrown headlong over the bridge. In his descent, however, the leg of his fustian trousers caught a large nail, which had been driven into the timber just upon the level of the lower roadway 90 feet above the river, and what is very remarkable, he hung suspended until some of the workmen rescued him from his perilous situation. August 6. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel, bart., accompanied by his family, arrived in Newcastle, on his way to the Highlands, and stayed for the night at the Queen's Head Inn. In the course of the evening the right honourable baronet took a walk through the town, taking particular notice of Mr. Grainger's erections, the High Level Bridge, &c. He was loudly cheered by a large crowd at the railway station on his departure. August 8. \u2014 This afternoon an awful storm of thunder and lightning broke over Newcastle and the neighbourhood. About two o'clock the sound of thunder and large drops of rain indicated the approach of a tempest. In a short time flash after flash of the intensest brightness lighted up the otherwise murky expanse, and peal after peal shook many dwellings to their foundations. Now the electric fluid, zigzag and pointed, issued forth from the overhanging darkness like the swift weapon of some minister of vengeance, commissioned to destroy. At Long Benton, Miss Hall, of the Ship Inn, was killed instantaneously by a flash of lightning, and the house and furniture were nearly destroyed. A female, named Scott, in the Dog-bank, Newcastle, was struck by the electric fluid, the ring on her finger was melted, and she and her child were severely scorched. At Cramlington nine young men had taken refuge in the engine shed at Shank House Colliery, when the lightning struck the building, and killed a man named Robert Liddell. Five men were also struck and much burnt near the same place. A man named John Stephenson was killed at Byer's Green. Amongst the property seriously damaged by the storm, in Newcastle, were Mr. Hardcastle's floor-cloth manufac-"], [254, "248 a.d. 1849.

Mather, Lovaine-place ; Mr. Henderson's Leazes-crescent ; one of the domes of the Central Exchange, and a house in Rewcastle chare. So tremendous was the storm that Newgate-street, near St. Andrew's Church, was impassible for several hours, and sixty cart loads of mud were afterwards taken away from Gallowgate alone. The Stock-bridge was also in a similar state, and in Gateshead, where the fair was being held, several of the stalls and a quantity of shoes, &c, were washed into the Tyne. 1849 (August 17). \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 68, Sir Cuthbert Sharp, F.S.A., and collector of customs at that port. This distin guished local antiquary was the son of Mr. Cuthbert Sharp, ship owner, and Susannah Crosby, sister of Brass Crosby, Lord Mayor of London in 1771. He was born at Sunderland, and received his early education at the school of Dr. Burney, Greenwich. The deceased, at an early age, accepted a commission in a regiment of fencible cavalry, and he served in Ireland during the rebellion, until these cavalry forces were disbanded. Mr. Sharp then retired from military life, and during the peace of Amiens he paid a visit to Paris, but after the disruption he was taken prisoner, with other Englishmen, and detained in France for some years. At last, through the influence of the Grand Juge Regnier, he obtained permission to visit Holland, and from thence he returned to England. He then settled at Hartlepool, devoting himself in retirement to literary pursuits, iu intimacy with the late John Ingram and Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth, whose kindred tastes encouraged him in the study of the local antiquities and history of the north. Having been elected a burgess of Hartlepool, his turn to serve the office of mayor arrived in the year 1816, during which he received the honour of knighthood, on presenting an address to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent. During the same year he published his \" History of Hartlepool,\" a very elaborate and interesting work, which established his reputation as an English antiquary. In 1823 he was appointed collector of customs at Sunderland, and in 1845 he was promoted to the same office at Newcastle, which appointment he held until the time of his death. His other publications were \"Memorials of. the Rebellion of 1569,\" a \" Memoir of Brass Crosby,'' \" Chronicon Mirabile,\" \"The Bishopric Garland,\" and several other works. He held the office of D.P.G.M. of Freemasons of the province of Durham for the last seventeen years of his life, and was greatly regretted by the members of that body. August 19. \u2014 A violent outbreak of cholera took place at Barnard Castle. During the last five months of the year 146 deaths occurred in that town from this direful disease. August 22. \u2014 Mr. Robert Heughan, a respectable draper in North Shields, threw himself from the cliffs, near Cullercoats, and was killed on the spot. He had been for some time in a low state of mind."], [255, "A.D. 1849.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 249 1849 (August 31) \u2014 Died, at his marine residence, Marsden Rock, aged 51, Mr. Peter Allan. This singular individual was a native of Tranent, in Scotland, but came, early in life, to the neighbourhood of Sunderland, and in 1828 he took up his abode amongst the fantastic caves and rocks with which the coast of Whitburn is studded. By dint of great exertion he succeeded in excavating five or six apartments out of the limestone rock, in which he established himself as an innkeeper, and from the peculiar beauty of the scenery it became a favourite resort of pic-nic parties from the surrounding neighbourhood. The \" Rock'' itself is an isolated mass of stone which, at high tide, is completely surrounded. At low water, however, it is easily accessible, and when the tourist or pleasure seeker has succeeded in gaining its summit, he is well repaid for his labour. It is covered with flowers and plants, many of them being very rare in the district ; whilst the curious mollusca clinging to the sides afford a good field for the naturalist. The view from the top is very beautful, and exhibits a panorama, towards sunset on a clear day, seldom to be met with elsewhere. In the im mediate vicinity of the inn the shore is thickly lined with caves and subterranean passages, which present to the stranger a very weird like appearance. There are, of course, many curious legends attached to this place, the major portion of which, however, are of the superstitious order ; but some few have their origin from the many daring deeds and hair-breath 'scapes which the lawless smugg lers used to undergo whilst engaged in their contraband traffic. The county of Durham was, at one time, notorious for smuggling, and this portion of the coast afforded perhaps better facilities for carrying on this species of trade than any other ; and doubtless the numerous caves were in great request as hiding places. In the place built by Mr. Allan he succeeded in bringing up a large family with great respectability, and it was not until 1848 that the lord of the manor (Mr. Ellison) made any claim for rent. The matter was compromised by Allan obtaining a lease of the property, which has been greatly improved by additional rooms built against the face of the rock. The place is still inhabited by the family, whose courtesy and obliging manners, and readiness to attend to the wants of visitors, has secured for them the highest encomiums from all who have paid this remarkable place a visit. September 3. \u2014 Jonas Worthington, Emanuel Fulwood, Thomas Miller, and Solomon Bankes, four workmen, belonging to Bishop wearmouth, went out to sea this afternoon, on a pleasure excursion. Next morning their boat was picked up bottom upwards. Notwith standing the most diligent search was instituted, Emanuel Fulwood's body was the only one found. September 28. \u2014 This day the Queen, Prince Albert, and the royal children visited Newcastle on their return from their annual visit to Scotland. Unfortunately the weather did not, on this occasion, second the wishes of the countless thousands who assembled to greet their sovereign. But this by no means damped VOL. III. I 1"], [256, "250 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1849. the loyal enthusiasm of the inhabitants of, and visitors to, the town. Numerous parties, many of them from considerable dis tances, had arrived the preceding day, and the influx of visitors was so great that some had great difficulty in procuring accom modation. Triumphal arches were erected across the railway at various parts of the line, and, notwithstanding \" the pelting of the pitiless storm,\" great crowds assembled at every place likely to afford a sight of the illustrious travellers. At Heaton there was a profuse display of flags and ornamental devices in flowers. The tunnel under New Bridge-street and the arch of the Argyle street bridge were richly decorated with laurel, flowers, &c, arranged with great taste, and on the latter was a conspicuous inscription \" Welcome to Newcastle and Gateshead.\" From thence to the Manors Railway Station a vast number of banners floated in all directions, and flags were also displayed from the spire of All Saints', the Castle, Guildhall, Mansion House, &c, &c , besides a number on the High Level Bridge. Dense masses of spectators were npon every eminence commanding a view of the railway, and the most enthusiastic loyalty was manifested by all classes. Shortly aster twelve o'clock the Castle guns announced the arrival of the royal train within the boundaries of the town, and immediately all eyes were fixed upon the first portion of line visible to the several spectators. The pilot-engine then arrived and the expectations of thousands were raised to their utmost pitch. Soon afterwards the train with its royal occupants was discerned on the viaduct leading through the town and the hum of voices at hand and distant cheering marked the onward progress of the carriages. As the train advanced the enthusiasm of those who obtained a view of her majesty was intense, and was frequently acknowledged by the royal party. On reaching the north-west extremity of the line an engine was attached to the train, richly ornamented with banners and evergreens, and they were drawn towards the centre of the High Level Bridge, where a spacious platform had been erected for the accommodation of the Mayor, Recorder, and Corporation of Newcastle ; the Mayor and Corporation of Gateshead ; the Mayor and Corporation of Durham; a detachment of the 63rd Regiment; and a large party of ladies and gentlemen. A beautiful triumphal arch spanned the lofty bridge, bearing the motto \" Welcome on both sides of the Tyne,\" which, with the countless flags on the ships and on each side of the river, had a very fine effect. On arriving in front of the platform her majesty was welcomed with loud aud repeated cheering, which the Queen, as well as Prince Albert, graciously acknowledged. Indeed, the condescending and animated manner of her majesty delighted all, while her light and beaming counten ance, in some measure, reflected the pleasure she experienced at the warm and joyous reception given to her. Every heart seemed to be animated with the kindliest sensations, and many a spon taneous expression was uttered for the health and prosperity and happyj reign of Queen Victoria, her Royal Consort, and her"], [257, "A.D. 1849.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 251 beautiful group of children. Sir George Grey having presented the Mayor of Newcastle (Captain Weatherley), his worship presented a dutiful address from the ancient town of which he was the representative. The Mayor of Gateshead (Mr. Hawks) then offered an address from that town, both documents being received with marked courtesy. After the royal party had remained about fifteen minutes on the bridge, surveying the rather novel appearance which the town presents from that lofty edifice, the train gradually moved off, amidst deafening cheers from the assembled crowds and another royal salute from the castle. In the evening many of the tradesmen in Newcastle illuminated the front of their premises in honour of the royal visit, and a grand dinner took place in Gateshead, the Mayor presiding. This was the first visit of a Queen of England to Newcastle since 1461, when Margaret of Anjou fled to it after the Battle of Towton. About one o'clock the Queen reached Darlington, having been received throughout the county of Durham with unmingled expressions of attachment and respect. The station was hung with banners and decorated with evergreens and flowers, and the royal party were hailed with rapturous acclamations by the multitude assembled. The Chief Bailiff of ' Darlington (Mr. F. Mewburn) was introduced to the Queen and delivered an address from the inhabitants, and, aster several gentlemen had had the honour of being presented, the train again proceeded southwards, the royal party sleeping at Derby in the evening, and reaching Osborne House, Isle of Wight, at half-past four o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th. 1849 (September 28/ \u2014 This morning, John Thompson, Robert Thompson, Matthew Mitcalf, John Mitcalf, Robert Young, and Edward Cooper, six pilots belonging to Monkwearmouth, put off to sea in a coble from the beach at Whitburn Bay. They had not been many minutes at sea when the boat swamped, and John Thompson, Robert Thompson, and Matthew Mitcalf were unfortu nately drowned. September \u2014 During this month the cholera attained its greatest virulence in the district, and its ravages excited intense alarm. Nearly one-third of the population of the villages of Lamesley, Wreckington, and Ayton Banks, near Gateshead, were affected with the disease, and more than one-half of the cases terminated fatally. At North Shields 137 were reported in a single week, and the total mortality in the Tynemouth and South Shields Unions was no less than 1,174 ; in Sunderland the deaths amounted to 435; Newcastle, 414; Gateshead, 292; Durham, 232; Barnard Castle, 146; Alnwick, 142; Berwick, 49; and Hartlepool, 161. The total number of deaths from cholera during the year in the two counties were : \u2014 Durham, 2,022 ; Northumberland, 1,680. October 9. \u2014 A very handsome service of plate was presented to John Grey, esq., of Dilston, by the members of the Tyneside Agricultural Society. The testimonial consisted of a superb and"], [258, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1849. 252 highly finished six armed acanthas centre piece, suitable either as a candlebra or an epergne. On its base, which formed a rich scroll tripod, were the arms of Mr. Grey, and also the following inscription : \u2014 To John Grey, esq. Presented by the members of the Tyneside Agricultural Society, of which he was the founder, and by his numerous other friends, as an expression of the high estimation they entertain of his character and talents, and of his invaluable services rendered to the interests of agriculture. In addition to the above there were sour silver double corner dishes of elegant design and very chaste in workmanship. The gift was valued at upwards of \u00a3300, and contained nearly 500 ounces of silver, and was manufactured at Messrs. Reid and Sons, of New castle, and certainly was an additional evidence of their superior skill in their profession. The presentation took place at Hexham, at the White Eart Inn The Rev. C. Bird presided on the occasion, and Mr. Ogle, M.P., Mr. G. Darling, Mr. H. Morton, and other gentlemen addressed the meeting, bearing witness to the distinguished merits of Mr. Grey as an agriculturist, and his disinterested industry and peculiar ability in inculcating an improved system of husbandry in the district Mr. Grey returned thanks for the present in very eloquent terms. The following account of Dilston may not be uninteresting to many of our readers : \u2014 Dilston stands above a mile south-west from Corbridge, and upwards of 2 J miles east by south from Hexham. The name is a contraction of Devil-stone, so called from its situation on the eastern banks of the stony brook Devil. Here was the baronial seat of the Devilstones. The old tower still remains. Adjoining to it, and on the brink of a steep hill clothed with wood, stood the mansion-house of the Ratcliffe family. It was built in 1616 by Francis Ratcliffe, esq., and, after falling into ruin, completely removed in 1768, by the advice of Mr. Smeaton. The chapel, though not used, is kept in repair ; and the vault contains the remains of several of the Ratcliffe family. The approach is romantic ; the rivulet, at its conflux with the Tyne, flows out of a deep dell, forming a grand natural cascade, after having passed a bridge of a single arch, which leads to the mansion ; through this arch a mill is seen, ovei which are lofty and impending cliff's : the whole embowered by trees, extending their branches from each side of the dell, and spreading out a leafy canopy, at least an hundred feet in height, shadowing the lower objects with a solemn gloom. William, son of Aluric, was lord of Devylstoune in the reign of Henry I. Robert de Devylstoune was assessed for the scutage of his barony, 18 and 23 Henry II.

Hunter had refused to join the trades' union, formed at the colliery, which was supposed to have been the cause of the murder. The perpetrators of the deed were not discovered. October 31. \u2014 Early this morning, a most alarming and destructive fire broke out in the General Bond Warehouse, situated in the Close, Newcastle, belonging to Mr. Amor Spoor, and before the flames could be subdued the contents of two of the warehouses, which principally consisted of hemp, tallow, groceries, wine, brandy, rum, &c, &c, were completely destroyed. The damage was estimated at several thousand pounds.

December 4. \u2014 This morning the inhabitants of North and South Shields were thrown into the greatest consternation by a most appalling and melancholy catastrophe occurring off the bar It appeared that, during a heavy gale, a brig called the Betsy, of Littlehampton, and the Danish schooner Aurora, drove upon the Herd Sand, at the entrance of the river Tyne, by which their crews were placed in imminent peril. In a short time the New castle and South Shields lifeboat, maimed by twenty-sour as able and experienced pilots as South Shields contained, was launched, and proceeded to the aid of the men on board of the vessels. The boat was soon alongside the brig, and ropes were being secured to the latter to facilitate communication, when a tremendous sea, in a conical form, caught the boat under its larboard quarter, canted it upwards, and then whirled it over, bottom upwards, the whole crew being engulphed in the boiling surge. The men on board the Betsy stood a few moments aghast at the awful scene, but did all they could under the circumstances by throwing pieces of timber overboard to aid any of the men to save themselves, but all in vain. Only four of the party were saved, the tempestuous sea washing the others away one by one. Thus, in a few moments, not a vestige was seen of twenty devoted and brave men, who had so shortly before breathed with hope and animation. All was hushed save the wild wind and the remorseless dash of billows, and no dirge sung the requiem of their departed spirits save the murmuring of the hollow sea. The accident created a great sensation through-"], [261, "A.D. 1850.] REMARKABLE EVENTS 255 out the kingdom, and a subscription, amounting to upwards of \u00a33,000, was raised for the widows and children ofthe unfortunate sufferers. 1849 (December 8/ \u2014 Died, at Linden, Northumberland, aged 76, Charles William Bigge, esq., a gentleman well known, universally respected, and, perhaps, during his life, one of the most active and useful members of the county with which he was associated by birth and interest and a bright example of an English country gentleman. He was well educated, intelligent, upright, and straightforward in his conduct, kind and benevolent iu his disposition, social in his habits, and of easy access to everyone who sought his intimacy or his aid and advice. Mr. Bigge, who succeeded to the family estates on the death of his father in 1794, was appointed, in 1798, Lieutenant-Colonel of the secoud battalion of the Northumberland Militia. In 1829 he succeeded Thomas Clennell, esq, as Chair man of the Bench of Magistrates, the duties of which office he continued to discharge with great ability until 1830, when declining health compelled him to relinquish it. Mr. Bigge was considered for upwards of fifty years one of the leaders of the Whig party in Northumberland, but political strife never deprived him of the high respect and good opinion of his most determined opponents ; and as a friend, a landlord, a magistrate, and a master he was universally held in estimation. He removed from the old family mansion at Benton in 1812, having then completed the erection ot his new hall at Linden. He was succeeded in his estates by his grandson. His eldest son, Charles John Bigge, esq., who was the first mayor elected for Newcastle aster the passing of the Municpal Reform Act, died in 1846, aged 43. December 14. \u2014 A public dinner was given in the Commercial Hotel, North Shields, to William Linskill, esq., Mayor of the New Borough of Tynemouth, in gratitude for his exertion \" for the emancipation of the commerce of the Tyne.\" Upwards of 150 of the most respectable inhabitants were present, the chair being occupied by Mr. R.

Thomas and James Hodgson having disposed ofthe \"Newcastle Chronicle,\" No. 4,459 was published by Mr. M. W. Lambert for himself and partners. The \"Chronicle\" was established in 1764, by Mr. Thomas Slack, and was published until his death, in 1784, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law, Mr. Solomon Hodgson. After Mr. Hodgson's death, in 1800, the publication ofthe \"Chronicle\" was continued by his widow, Mrs. Sarah Hodgson, under the able management and editorship of Mr. William Preston, for upwards of twenty-two years. A splendid portrait and exact likeness of Mr. Preston is now in the possession of Mr. Thomas Dixon, Newcastle. In 1822 Mrs. Hodgson died, and her sons, named above, took the management. May 24, 1850, the \" Chronicle\" was published in the new premises in Grey-street for the first time, the machinery being put in motion by one of Mr. W. G. Armstrong's hydraulic engines."], [262, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1850. 256 1850 (January 10/ \u2014 Died, at Bishopwearmouth, in Bridge-street, suddenly, aged 73, William Reid Clanny, esq., M.D., F.R.S., &c. The deceased had practised in Sunderland for upwards of forty five years with great ability and success. In 1812 he turned his attention to the cause of the disastrous calamities in coal mines, and in the course of his studies he conceived the idea of a safety lamp, greatly different, however, from tbat at present in use. On tbe lst October, 1813, his lamp was exhibited before the Literary and Philosophical Society in Newcastle, and in 1815 it was tried in Merrington Pit with some success, but owing to its cumbrous form it never came into use. As, however, it was not until 1815 that either Sir Humphrey Davy or Mr. Stephenson commenced their investigations on explosive mixtures, it is clear that Dr. Clanny is entitled to considerable credit for his invention, and on February 3rd, 1848, he was presented with a testimonial, value \u00a3200, by the Marquis of Londonderry and other coal owners. The deceased contributed largely to medical literature, and for his valuable works in that department he received the ribbon of the Legion of Honour and many other badges of distinction. A few days beiore his death Dr. Clanny presented the Literary Society of Sun derland with portraits of George III., Archdeacon Paley, the Marquis of Londonderry, Baron Cuvier, and the donor himself, the latter being from a painting by Reay, in the Town Hall, presented to the deceased by the medical profession of Sunderland. January 29. \u2014 This afternoon three vessels sailed from the port of Sunderland, but, the wind blowing strong from the north east, with a heavy sea, they were speedily driven ashore, near to the south pier, the waves at the same time making a complete breach over them. Immediate efforts were made to save the crews, but, notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, four men, named Douglas, Proud, Chisholm, and Reay were swept away by the sea and drowned. The vessels in a short time aster wards became total wrecks. January 29. \u2014 Great excitement was occasioned among the inhabitants in the vicinity of the Gaol, Newcastle, by the report that four convicts had made their escrpe. Between twelve and one at noon four prisoners under sentence of transportation, named Job Savage, John Dunn, William Donkin, and Matthew Oliver, had succeeded in making their way from the convicts' to the debtors' yard, and by using a ladder belonging to some masons employed in the gaol, they gained the top of the high wall fronting Carliol-street. They next tied a rope which they had obtained to the ladder, when three of them lowered themselves into the street and made a precipitate flight towards Trafalgar street. The fourth one (Job Savage) was not fortunate, for on reaching the pavement he was seized by a person named Robson, who was passing at the time, transferred to his old quarters, and the escape of his comrades made known. A general pursuit was commenced, and they were traced up Pandon Dean, near the old water mill, and afterwards to Lambert's Leap. Dunn, weary with"], [263, "A.D. 1850.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 257 running, leaped over the wall and lay down, where he was captured by P.C. Turner. Donkin was taken in Mr. Ralph Naters' brewery yard, just as he was coming out. A most diligent search was made for Oliver, who eluded detection until about six o'clock, when he was apprehended by P.C. Graham, coming along the Shieldfield without his shoes. BRANCEPATH CASTLE, AS IT APPEARED BEFORE THE ALTERATIONS. 1850 (January 30). \u2014 Died, at Brancepath Castle, Durham, aged 51, William Russell, esq. Mr. Russell succeeded his father, the rebuilder of the castle, in 1822, and was elected a repre sentative for the county of Durham in 1828, on the elevation of Mr. Lambton to the peerage. He was again returned in 1830 and 1831, but did not offer himself after the passing of the Reform Bill. His estates devolved on his only sister, Emma Maria, who married the Hon. Gustavus Hamilton, eldest son of Viscount Boyne, and who soon after assumed the name of Russell. February8. \u2014 This morning, between two andfour o'clock, theshop of Mr. John Mitchell, silversmith, Sunderland, was broken into and the following articles stolen therefrom : \u2014 6 large sized gold lever watches ; 4 silver lever and 18 silver geneva watches ; 150 fancy stone rings ; eighty wedding rings ; &c, &c. The circumstances of the case were somewhat extraordinary, and it created great excitement in the town for several week3. A man, named Magnay, was subsequently apprehended and transported for the robbery. February 20. \u2014 George Darling, esq., of Fowberry Tower, Nor thumberland, whilst hunting with Lord Elcho's hounds was thrown from his horse whereby he received some severe internal k 1"], [264, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.V. 1850. 258 injuries. He was taken into a cottage near at hand. Professor Syme was sent for from Edinburgh, and every available assistance procured, but all efforts were in vain as he sunk rapidly and breathed his last on the 24th. Mr. Darling had recently succeeded to the estates of his uncle, Matthew Culley, esq., of Fowberry Tower, and a few weeks ago was appointed a magistrate for the county of Northumberland. The lamented gentleman was in his 44th year. 1850 (February 25). \u2014 A meeting was held in the Lecture Room, Newcastle, for the purpose of hearing a statement from Captain Ibbetson, who had been deputed by Her Majesty's Commissioners to assist in promoting an Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations, to be held in London iu 1851. The Mayor (Mr. Crawhall) presided, and resolutions in support of the exhibition were carried unanimously. Eight local commissioners were appointed, the Mayor of Newcastle being the representative of lead mines and ornamental art ; the Mayor of Gateshead (Mr. Hawks), of iron works ; Mr. Hugh Taylor, of coal mines ; Mr. R. S. Newall, of machinery ; Mr. J. Pattinson, of chemical manufactures ; Mr. W. Smith, of shipbuilding ; Mr. R. W. Swinburne, of glass ; and Mr. J. Grey (Dilston), of agriculture. A subscription was opened to assist in carrying out the exhibition which ultimately amounted to \u00a3522. Similar meetings were held in all the towns in the district, and the following were the names of the chairmen of the local committees and the amounts subscribed: \u2014 Berwick \u2014 Captain Smith, \u00a326. Bar nard Castle \u2014 Rev. G. Dugard, \u00a313. Darlington \u2014 F. Mewburn, \u00a367. Durham \u2014 J. H. Forster, \u00a3170. Hartlepool \u2014 J. P. Denton, \u00a337. South Shields \u2014 R.

March 19. \u2014 An elegant and valuable testimonial was presented to Mr. John Mawson, of Mosley-street, Newcastle, consisting of a handsome silver tea service, the ': Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" in 21 volumes, \" Allison's History of Europe\" in 20 volumes, bound uniform with the above, and all enclosed in a beautiful mahogany case made for the purpose by Messrs. Sopwith. The tea service was manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons. Upon a silver plate in the front of the case is the following inscription : \u2014 \"A testimonial to the exemplary honour and rectitude of Mr. John Mawson, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, as manifested in his commercial transactions, presented, in the name of the subscribers, by William McCulloch, esq., of London, March 19th, 1850.\" March 23. \u2014 The most intense horror was excited by the report that an atrocious and cunningly devised murder had been com mitted on the person of a woman, named Elizabeth Forbes, by one who ought to have been her natural protector her husband, Patrick Forbes, in the Cloggers'-entry, Head of the Side, Newcastle. From the evidence given at the inquest, and subsequently at the trial of the wretched prisoner, it was clearly demonstrated that one of the most barbarous modes which could possibly be devised had been adopted in accomplishing this foul and unnatural murder."], [265, "A.D. 1850.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 259' It was stated that the prisoner, who was a labouring man, led an intemperate life, and that his unfortunate wife was too frequently seen drinking by his side in public houses where he resorted. On the day previous they had been together in the afternoon, and were much the worse of liquor\u2014 indeed it was said that the woman had lost the use of her limbs and had to be carried upstairs to bed by the prisoner and some women. They were then left together, and early in the morning Forbes awoke his son, a boy 12 years of age, who was lying before the fire of their room, and told him that his mother was dead, and, upon an alarm being raised, it was discovered that the unfortunate woman had been murdered in a manner so horrible as to be almost unprecedented in the annals of crime, and it was not until a close examination had been made that the cause of death became apparent. The perpetrator of this monstrous act was tried and convicted before Mr. Justice Wight man, on the 31st of July, and his execution took place at the foot of Carliol-street, near the Gaol, on the 24th August. 1850 (March 30). \u2014 A terrific gale visited the north-east coast of England, and the results were of a most destructive character. For some weeks previous the colliers bound from London to the Tyne, had been detained in Yarmouth Roads by adverse winds, until the number of vessels there amounted to nearly 500, and on the 28th, the wind having ehanged, they were all liberated together. On the 29th the wind increased to a violent gale, and in the evening three vessels, the precursors of the fleet, were driven upon the rocks at Tynemouth. This morning these were followed by a Hanoverian galliot, next by a Swedish vessel, then by the Vigilant brig and the Mary Ann, of Shields, &c. By noon the gale was at its height, and the whole of the vessels having now arrived off the coast, a most extraordinary scene was witnessed as they crowded into the river. Happily there was no loss of life, but the spectacle of upwards of thirty stranded barks, some with valuable cargoes, was a most melancholy one. At Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bamburgh, Blyth, Amble, and other places, many casualties occurred, and the total loss of property was enormous : the damage at Sunderland alone being estimated at \u00a326,000. April 27. \u2014 Mr. John Horn Twizell, eldest son of John Twizell Wawn, esq., M.P., was accidentally drowned in the North Tyne, near Chollerford, whilst fishing, having been seized with a fit and fallen into the stream. The unfortunate young man was in his 22nd year. June 5. \u2014 An explosion took place in the Wellington Pit, at Usworth, the property of Messrs. Jonassohn and Co. Nearly 160 persons were down the pit at the time, but the effects of the explosion were confined to one portion of the mine, where twelve men and a boy were killed. June 20. \u2014 The northern section of that great commercial undertaking, the south dock at Sunderland, was opened under circumstances of great ceremony and splendour. The dock was estimated to contain 260 vessels, and the half-tide basin, 28."], [266, "260 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1850. Shortly after ten o'clock G. Hudson, esq., M.P., with the directors and shareholders of the company, walked in procession from the dock-office to the ferry-boat landing, where several gaily-decked steamers were in readiness, and the flotilla, which was joined by numberless craft, entered the tidal harbour, and passed into the dock amidst immense cheering from upwards of 30,000 spectators. Two vessels, the Welcome and the Cleadon, elaborately decked with flags, were next towed in, and placed under the coal drops, where they were speedily filled with Haswell and South Hetton coals, and they were immediately succeeded by two other ships, the Don and the Susannah. The directors then landed with their friends, and sat down to an elegant entertainment, laid out in the adjoining staith, the chair being occupied by Mr. Hudson. The chairman, in complimenting the directors on their energy in carrying out the undertaking, stated that the extent of the dock was unequalled by any in the kingdom. Great rejoicings took place amongst the inhabitants generally, aud the day was kept as a holiday throughout the neighbourhood, 1850(June 24^). \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Lord Eglinton's Elthiron (Cart wright), beating Roland, Glauca, and four others. The Gold Cup was won by Lord Stanley's Canezou (Holmes), beating S. Ogle's Achyranthes. 5 to 1 on Canezou. A splendid race and won by a neck. June 28. \u2014 Some time previous to this date Mr. Steel, draper, Blyth, had the pavement in front of his shop laid with flag stones, and to-day, in consequence of one of the stones having risen considerably above its proper level, a mason was sent for to ascertain the cause. On raising the flag, which was about six stones in weight, it was discovered that three large mushrooms were growing underneath, and had evidently lifted it out of its proper position. July 30. \u2014 The friends and admirers of Robert Stephenson, esq., M.P., the celebrated civil engineer, gave him a splendid public banquet in the Central Station, Newcastle, as a mark of respect for his talents, science, and unblemished character. The station was beautifully decorated for the occasion, and views of Mr. Stephenson's greatest public works were introduced with considerable effect, viz. : \u2014 the Menai Tubular Bridge, the High Level Bridge at Newcastle, and the great viaduct at Berwick. The Hon. H. T. Liddell presided, the vice-chairs being occupied by the Mayors of Newcastle and Gateshead (Mr. Crawhall and Mr. Hawks). About 400 gentlemen were present, comprising almost every influential person connected with Newcastle, and the pro ceedings throughout were of a very pleasing character. In the course of the evening it was stated that Mr. Stephenson had, up to this time, been engaged in the construction of 1,790 miles of rail way in England alone. August 18. \u2014 Four persons, named John Clark, John Forest, Ehzabeth Carr, and Ann Bowey, engaged a boat at Sunderland"], [267, "A.D. 1850.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 261 for the purpose of visiting Marsden Rock. They were subse quently observed off the Dove Rock, near Hendon, but were never afterwards heard of. 1850 (August 29/ \u2014 Her Majesty the Queen, accompanied by the royal family, passed through Durham and Northumberland on her way to Scotland. At Newcastle the greatest preparations had been made to do honour to the royal travellers, and as her majesty had graciously consented to inaugurate the Central Railway Station, that building was beautifully decorated throughout. The approach of royalty to the ancient walls of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in olden times, according to traditionary records, had been marked with every demonstration of splendour harmonizing with the occasion, besides being accompanied with other features corre sponding to the stirring period in which they lived, and, of course, too frequently, majesty was heralded in with shrill trump and all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war. But since those days of border feuds and civil and intestine broils other and more genial objects occupy the energies and pursuit of the nation, and instead of pillage and commotion the humanizing arts of peace have shed a refining and softening influence over the land, and England now stands conspicuous as possessing within itself resources of the highest order for the future elevation and welfare of its subjects. At twenty minutes to one o'clock her majesty's arrival at the High Level Bridge was announced by royal salutes fired from both sides of the river, and the train was immediately drawn into the Central Station, amidst deafening cheering and the wildest enthusiasm. After a formal reception of the authorities the Queen acknowledged the enthusiastic salutations of the spec tators by bowing graciously, and then proceeded to the suite of apartments provided for her reception, where addresses from the Corporations of Newcastle and Gateshead were presented. The royal party subsequently partook of an elegant luncheon, and after a stay of about twenty minutes they returned to the train, where they made a brief but graceful adieu to the authorities and the assemblage generally, the carriages leaving the station amidst the firing of cannon and the heartfelt acclamations of the public, who densely lined the route for a considerable distance. The royal train then proceeded on to Berwick, where her majesty had graciously undertaken to open the magnificent railway bridge which there connects the two kingdoms. The dense masses of people assembled at Tweedmouth and Berwick were quite astonishing considering the population of the district, and nothing could exceed the enthusiasm of all classes. A splendid triumphal arch spanned the lofty bridge, and upon it was the conspicuous and appropriate inscription, \" The Last Act of the Union.\" At ten minutes past three the train came in sight, and as soon as it reached the station Mr. Leeman, chairman of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway Company, conducted her majesty and the royal family, amidst every demonstration of joy, to a pavilion which had been erected and gaily decorated for their reception."], [268, "262 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1850. The Mayor and Sheriff of Berwick and Colonel Wellesley were then presented by Sir George Grey, and her majesty having sur veyed the beautiful and extensive panorama commanded by tha pavilion and expressed her admiration of the landscape, was graciously pleased to name the imposing structure the \" Royal Border Bridge.\" After remaining a few minutes her majesty and the prince returned to the railway station, where an address from the Corporation of Berwick was presented and received very courteously. The royal party then took their seats and proceeded on their route amidst enthusiastic cheering. 1850 (September 8). \u2014 A number of whales made their appearance off Tynemouth, and created some sensation amongst the numerous residents there. On the following morning upwards of fifty tons of fish arrived in Newcastle, and herrings were sold at eight a penny. The whales remained upon the coast for some days. September 28. \u2014 This morning the passengers on the High Level Bridge were alarmed by a man jumping off the parapet into the river, and afterwards swimming towards the south shore. On enquiry it was found that the person's name was Williamson, employed at Hawks and Crawshay's foundry. The feat had been performed for a wager of a quart of ale. November 1. \u2014 The first election of councillors for the new borough of South Shields took place, and considerable excitement prevailed during the day. At the close of the poll the following gentlemen were declared to be elected by Richard Shortridge, the returning officer: \u2014 South Shields Ward \u2014 James Young, 263; Thomas Stainton, 263 : George Potts, 241 ; John Clay, 238 ; John N, Hall, 228 ; T.

The deceased was formerly one of the propietors of the \" Newcastle Chronicle,\" and was the editor of that periodical from the close of 1807 to the commencement of 1848, when serious illness disabled him from continuing his arduous task. Mr. Hodgson's literary attainments were considerable, and his acquaint ance with the antiquities of the North of England was perhaps beyond that of any other individual in the district. He was of a very kind disposition, and greatly esteemed by a large circle of friends.

From the close contiguity of the colliery to the town from which it derives its name, the alarm spread in all directions, and the usual quietude gave place to the greatest consternation by the report that 150 lives were destroyed, that number being down the pit at the time of the accident. A number of brave men volunteered, with the usual magnanimity displayed under such circumstances, to make an attempt to save their relatives and friends, and, after five hours arduous exertions, they succeeded in rescuing one hundred and twenty-four men and boys, many of whom were in a state of insensibility, the remainder, twenty-six in number, were found dead. The sufferings of the survivors, during the protracted period which elapsed before their deliverance, were of the most intense character, both bodily and mental, and the meeting between them and their disconsolate families, who had given them up as lost, will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. The sufferers, with two exceptions, were unmarried, and the Earl of Durham ordered that every necessary relief should be afforded them. December 5. \u2014 The Queen granted a new charter to the town of Hartlepool, by which it was in future to be governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors. Much rejoicing took place on the obtainment of this document, the former charter having been peculiarly obnoxious to the inhabitants generally. December 18. \u2014 A boiler explosion occurred at Crow Trees Colliery, Durham, by which two men lost their lives. December 20th, a similar accident occurred at Ford Paper Mill, near Sunder land, by which a father and son, named Oliver, were killed. December 1 9. \u2014 A public dinner was given in the Golden Lion Inn, South Shields, to John Clay, esq., mayor of the borough, as a mark of the respect of the inhabitants and in celebration of the incorpo ration of the town. One hundred and forty gentlemen sat down to dinner, the chair being occupied by R. Ingham, esq., M.P., and the vice-chairs by Messrs. Mather, Paxton, and Wallis. 1851 (January 4). \u2014 Died, at Ramsey, Isle of Man, aged 38, Sir Henry Claude Loraine, third son of the late Sir C. Loraine, bart., of Kirkharle. By the deaths of three nephews in succession, within two years, William Loraine, esq., one of the magistrates for the borough of Newcastle, succeeded to the baronetcy, which has been attached to the family for several generations. January 6. \u2014 The first election of councillors for the borough of Hartlepool took place, in accordance with the provisions of the new charter. There were twenty-seven candidates, and much excitement prevailed throughout the day. The following gentle-"], [270, "264 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1851. men were declared elected : \u2014 S. Robinson, 472 ; Robert Hunter, 304 ; Thomas Robson, 302 ; John Todd, 287 ; C. Davison, 280 ; John Mowbray, 278; R. Brewis, 272; R. E. Hutton, 269 ; R. Winstanley, 267. January 14th, Stephen Robinson, esq., was elected mayor, J. P. Denton, W. Gordon, C. Davison, and J. Winstanley aldermen, and Thomas Belk town clerk. 1851 (January 10;. \u2014 Died, at Fenham Hall, near Newcastle, aged 79, Colonel Robert Bell. The deceased served the office of Mayor of Newcastle in 1822-3, and was the only alderman of the old corporation appointed to the same office under the new regime. February 8. \u2014 Mr. William Martin, the well-known Christian Philosopher and \" Philosophical Conqueror of All Nations,\" died in London, aged 79. (See Sykes, vol. 2, page 82.) The deceased from his earliest youth exhibited considerable indications of mechanical genius, and on the 31st of May, 1814, he received the silver medal and ten guineas from the Society of Arts for his invention of a spring weighing machine, with circular dial and index. His genius, however, was not always so beneficially exercised nor so well employed, for in 1821 he announced that he had discovered the principle of perpetual motion, and in the following year he exhibited his \"Eureka\" in London and other places. Its motive power was a strong current of air, and it is unnecessary to add that it failed to answer the purpose of its inventor. He then published \" A New System of Natural Philo sophy, in Refutation of Sir Isaac Newton and other Pretenders to Science.\" In June, 1830, he undertook a lecturing tour through out England, and returned in the summer of the following year triumphant. From that time till within two years of his death the \" Philosopher\" continued to print his lucubrations on all sorts of subjects in great abundance, and his extraordinary attempts at poetry contributed greatly to the amusement of the people. His eccentricities of costume were not less remarkable : for some years previous to his death his head-dress consisted of the shell of a tortoise, mounted with brass, and his breast was generally orna mented with a variety of stars and other decorations of unknown derivation. This harmless eccentric was the brother of Jonathan Martin, the notorious incendiary, and of the celebrated painter, John Martin, who kindly invited him to his residence in 1849, and with whom he spent hi3 last days in comparative affluence. The following is a specimen of his poetry : \u2014 \u25a0 The ladie Faversham, a bark of 30 keels, sunk in Shields harbour did much annoy ; The Martinian invention gave her the grand lift, the people, well pleased, shouted for joy. Glover, the diseased potatoe quack doctor, of his wisdom people have of him their doubts, Writer for a silly doctor in Sunderland, both as daft as the calf that eats clouts. George Stephenson and son, mock Engineers, and both knaves and loons, If they do not answer the Philosopher, a proof that he has snuffed out their full moons."], [271, "A.D. 1851.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 265 1851 (February 11/ \u2014 A splendid piece of silver plate, costing upwards of 500 guineas, was presented to Ralph Ward Jackson, esq.f; of Greatham Hall, by the merchants, shipowners, tradesmen, and others, residing in West Hartlepool, or connected with its trade, as a token of their admiration of the skill, energy, and patient perseverance displayed in projecting and executing the Hartlepool West Harbour and Docks. If the adage nil desperandum was ever applicable it was in this case, for in despite of natural and alleged scientific difficulties one individual of indomitable spirit and enter prise undertook the work, and the result has been crowned with the most complete success. Hence the harbour, docks, and works of West Hartlepool, once a morass and moor, covering an extent of near 300 acres, with the town, now having a population of upwards of 20,000, has sprung up into notoriety, as if by talis manic influence, and what a few years ago was a solitude is now a flourishing mart of industry, trade, and commerce, with its docks, quays, and shipping, its streets and thoroughfares, public buildings and other concomitants, the harbingers of future greatness. The presentation took place at a public dinner, at the Ship Hotel, to which 150 gentlemen sat down, Mr. E. Turnbull, of Hartlepool, presiding. Description of the testimonial : \u2014 Elevated on a column decorated with bull-rush and lotus leaves is the bust of Mr. Jackson ; around are the figures of Commerce, Science, and Industry. Industry, with the distaff in her hand and the bee hive by her side, supports it on the right, while Science, her foot resting on the globe, is decorating the bust with a wreath of laurel, and Com merce, the cornucopia by her side and the caduceus in her hand, is pointing to a view taken from the sea of the Hartlepool West Harbour and Docks. Reclining on the base are the figures of Neptune and \u00c6olus, the representatives of the elements, wind and water ; between are groups of shipping implements, and on the pedestal below are panels containing the inscription, arms, cypher, and crest of Mr. Jackson, and the various mouldings are formed of cables and oak leaves. The whole is placed beneath a revolving glass shade, upon a stand richly carved with dolphins on the feet and emblematical devices on the sides, and stands upwards of six feet in height. The testimonial, which was much admired by the company, has been displayed in several of the public exhibitions of this country. March 3. \u2014 Died, in Oyster Shell-lane, Newcastle, aged 63, Mr. William Mitford, shoemaker. The deceased was one of the last of the old school of local poets, and was well known in the district. His \" Pitman's Courtship,\" for its liveliness and fidelity to nature, may be considered one of the best of Newcastle songs, March 18. \u2014 Whilst twenty-three fishing boats were follow ing their occupation off Newbiggen, Northumberland, a gale suddenly arose, and the sea was instantly thrown into a violent state of commotion. The fishermen made for the shore as speedily as possible, and nearly the whole of them got into Cresswell in safety, but two boats, which attempted to land at Snab's Point, VOL. III. L 1"], [272, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1851. 266 were upset, and of the crews, eight in number, only one man was saved. A third boat was upset at Newbiggen and two of the men were lost. The melancholy accidents were witnessed by hundreds of spectators, who were perfectly unable to render assistance, although the men were drowned within a sew feet from the shore. The scene was one of the most heart-rending description: men, women, and children, running to and fro in wild despair, and nothing was heard for some time but sounds of lamentation commingling with the roar and surge of the ocean. The sufferers were nearly all closely related to each other, aad a subscription was raised for their surviving relatives. 1851 (March 22/ \u2014 The coal miners of Northumberland and Durham assembled in the Lecture Room, Newcastle, for the purpose of presenting Mr. James Mather, of South Shields, with an elegant piece of plate as a token \"of their gratitude for his talented and praiseworthy exertions in promoting measures to diminish the dangers arising from bad ventilation and other causes in the mines of this kingdom.'' April 3. \u2014 A numerous and influential meeting of the Governors of Newcastle Infirmary was held in the large hall, for the purpose of transacting the usual business of the anniversary, and considering the expediency of enlarging the building. The Infimary was first established in 1751, consequently that meeting formed the centenary of the institution. August 6, another meeting was held, the Duke of Northumberland in the chair, when resolutions, urging the necessity of the extension, were proposed by William Ord, esq., M.P., Matthew Bell, esq., M.P., the Hon H. T. Liddell, W. B Beaumont, esq., &c. The chairman subscribed \u00a3500, offering to double it if the alterations were fully carried out. The Bishop of Durham and Mr. Beamont gave 250 guineas each ; Misses Davison, Lemington, \u00a3250 ; the Corporation of Newcastle, \u00a3200, and munificent donations from other parties, soon raised the required funds to upwards of \u00a35,000. April 7. \u2014 The public baths and wash-houses erected by the Corporation of Sunderland, from designs by Mr. Thomas Oliver, architect, at a cost of about \u00a33,000, were opened for the use of the public, and the building was pronounced one of the most elegant and commodious of the kind in the kingdom. May 19. \u2014 A violent thunderstorm passed over this town and neighhourhood. A man, named Thomas Fibb, was struck dead on tbe Durham-road, near Gateshead Low Fell. Ee was going to meet his father and mother and other friends, who were comin\u00ab from Chester-le-Street, and who were little more than one hundred yards from him when he was struck by the electric fluid. They observed a person fall, but did not suspect who it was, and it was some time before they recognized the fallen youth to be their relative. He was much scorched about the face and his clothes were torn off and scattered about the road. The lightning also struck the house of Mr. J. Atkinson, Windmill-hills, Gateshead, but although the ornaments were knocked off the mantel-piece of"], [273, "A.D. 1851.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 267 the sitting-room and the walls severely shattered, Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson escaped unhurt. The house of Mr. Muras, Arthur's hill, Newcastle, was also seriously damaged by the electric fluid. A child on the Rabbit-banks, Gateshead, was also struck by the lightning, and several others were more or less affected during the storm. 1851 (May). \u2014 About the end of this month Richard Grainger, esq., commenced pulling down the old buildings in Nun's-gate, preparatory to widening the thoroughfare and erecting a row of handsome shops and warehouses of the same style of archictecture as Grainger- street. June 13. \u2014 A fire suddenly broke out in an unfinished house in Elswick West-terrace, Newcastle, the property of Mr. William Dunn, builder. It was discovered by George Cantley, who was in the act of ascending to the second storey by means of a ladder, and on placing his hand upon the stone against which the ladder rested, he found it hot, and his head, as he was about to pass into the room, was surrounded by flames, he was much burnt about the hand, his paper cap was destroyed, his hair singed, his face scorched, but he instantly retreated and escaped further damage. The flames rapidly spread over the entire premises as well as to a house adjoining, and in a short time the whole were entirely consumed. Mr. Scaife, solicitor, resided cn the south side of the burning pro perty, and his family being from home at the time, the mob forced an entrance and completely sacked the house of the furniture, pulled down the marble chimney pieces, and left the place in little better condition than the adjoining ruins. June 23. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. T. Williamson's b c Neasham (Haxby), beating Testator, Jack Leeming, and five others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Eden's ch m The Maid of Masham (Abdale), beating Lord Stanley's Ariel. July 2. \u2014 Mr. John Challoner, who for upwards of twenty years held an important situation on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, determined to join his son, Mr. J. S. Challoner, sharebroker, Dean-street, Newcastle, as partner in the business. In consequence of this arrangement Mr. Challoner resigned his situation this day. Matthew Plummer, esq., who presided as chairman when Mr. Challoner 's resignation was sent in, informed him that the directors received it with regret, and assured him that they had the highest regard for him personally, and a just sense of his faithful services for more than twenty years, and, as a further mark of their satis faction at his conduct, requested his acceptance of \u00a3100, and also ordered that the expression of their sentiments should be entered on the minutes of their proceedings. In conclusion, the worthy chairman expressed his pleasure in making the announcement, and added his own testimony from personal knowledge to the industry, honour, and integrity of his conduct whilst connected with the company, and sincerely wished him success in the business he had made choice of."], [274, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OP [a.D. 1851. 268 1851 (July 25).\u2014 Whilst a party of gentlemen were drinking champagne in the Bridge Hotel, Sunderland, some practical joking took place, in the course of which Mr. Buchanan, shipbuilder, threw a tumbler glass at Mr. C. John Spence, shipbroker. The missile hit Mr. Spence on the head, and wounded him so seriously that, after lingering in great agony until the 4th of August, he expired from the effects of the injuries he had received. Mr. Buchanan was arrested for causing the death of Spence, and com mitted to take his trial for manslaughter. He was tried for the offence, before Baron Alderson, at the ensuing assizes at Durham, and acquitted. July 31. \u2014 Sir T. J. Platt, Justice of Assize, arrived in New castle, and was met at the railway station by the High Sheriff of Northumberland (Sir Horace St. Paul, bart). Departing from conventional usage, the High Sheriff's carriage was simply an old britska, without heraldic ornaments, the trumpeters were in ordinary habiliments, and instead of six horses the vehicle was drawn by two animals in homely harness, and was unattended by any servants on horseback. The learned Judge, in charging the Grand Jury, expressed \" his great regret that in this important county the gentry should be so reduced as not to show ordinary respect to the Crown. In this country, where disloyalty is con sidered a slur, it was to be regretted that the usual and ordinary garniture by which that loyalty is displayed should not have been exhibited on this occasion.\" The High Sheriff, with great warmth, declared the charge of disloyalty to be unjust. Baron Platt retorted, \" Then I must say that, as a gentleman who has ample means, that loyalty has not been exhibited.\" The High Sheriff, who evidently did not believe that, to be truly loyal, was to exhibit a large amount of useless pageantry, did not alter the state of things during his lordship's stay in the town. Many of the landed gentry of the district were and are doubtless of a similar opinion, but lax courage to show it. The absurity of the paraphernalia exhibited by some High Sheriffs is ridiculous in the extreme ; for, whilst the judges are on all occasions ushered into a town with blowing of trumpets, ringing of bells, and gorgeous and expensive show of carriages and liveried servants, and kept at the expense of the rate payers of the district, they invariably leave the town in a very unostentatious manner, and frequently at their own expense. The majesty ofthe law would not certainly be marred one iota were less of the \" outward show\" exhibited towards the judges, and a more simple system introduced on the juidical bench, whereby suitors might have justice administered to them in a cheaper and more expeditious manner, and so do away, in a great measure, with the tedious and expensive litigation which is now so frequently indulged in, to the great annoyance and loss of those who have the misfortune to attend the law courts. August. \u2014 About this time workmen commenced removing the old buildings opposite the Roman Catholic Chapel, in Clayton street, Newcastle, for the pupose of erecting a new chapel for the"], [275, "A.D. 1851.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 269 congregation which had hitherto worshipped in the Groat-market. A portion of the walls of the town and the \" Pink Tower,\" which once served as an outer rampart, were removed by the workmen, not without considerable regret on the part of antiquarians, who were greatly indignant at the gradual disappearance of the many ancient land-marks with which the town was surrounded. 1851 (August 15/ \u2014 Much excitement was created in Newcastle on it becoming known that Mr. James Scott, assistant-overseer for St. Nicholas' parish, had absconded with a large sum of money. The deficiency was afterwards found to be \u00a33,000. Every effort to discover the whereabouts of the delinquent proved futile, and it was at length discovered that Scott had fled to America. He appears to have taken a large farm, and lived in great affluence, \" far from the noise of town and party strife.\" There was, at that time, no extradition laws by which he could be arrested and brought back to this country, and he consequently lived in perfect quiet, and might have enjoyed such tranquility for many years but lor an accident which occurred in 1852, when he was discovered lying dead in his grounds, with a gun lying beside him. Whether his death was premeditated or accidental was not, however, ascertained. August 18. \u2014 A fearful colliery accident occurred at Washington, Durham, by which thirty -two men and boys unfortunately perished, besides two brave fellows, named Hutchinson and Errington, who lost their lives in a magnanimous attempt to save those of others. The explosion was believed to have occurred in consequence of a man having removed the top from his Davy lamp. Here was another instance of the recklessness of the generality of colliers, who have no thought of their own lives, nor any anxiety for the safety of others, so long as their own particular whims are satisfied. At some future day science may perhaps invent some thing whereby the explosive gases in mines may be rendered comparatively harmless ; and thus the lives of hundreds will not be placed in jeopardy, as is now the case, through the wanton careless ness of one man. Ten widows and thirty-three children were left destitute by this melancholy catastrophe, but a handsome sum was raised by subscription for their relief, and judiciously distributed according to the separate wants of each. August 27. \u2014 Great consternation was created in Morpeth from a report that a butcher, named Joseph Milburn, had been robbed and murdered during the night. It appeared that on the previous evening he had ridden to Bothal Rectory to receive an account. On his return he called at a public house at East Choppoington, where he remained till about midnight when he left the house with a friend, a Mr. Lowes. Next morning his horse was found with the bridle cut, Milburn's hat lying on the road side, and his pocket-book turned inside out beside it. The appear ances were such that it became evident to everyone that a most foul and diabolical murder had been committed, and the body afterwards secreted in some of the adjacent woods. A diligent search was made for Milburn in every direction, and the locality and surrounding"], [276, "270 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D 1851. neighbourhood was in a state of intense alarm for many weeks, as all efforts to find the body, or any clue to the murderer proved fruitless. It was subsequently discovered that the scoundiel, who was deeply embarrassed, had decamped to America, where he evidently felt inclined to remain ; for had he ventured near Morpeth again, his reception would have been warm in the extreme, so strong was the feeling against him for perpetrating so diabolical a hoax. 1851 (September 1/ \u2014 A most distressing and fatal accident occurred at Howdon, on the river Tyne, by which seven persons, were drowned. As a sculler boat, containing seventeen persons, was proceeding from the village to a steamboat lying in the river, about to proceed to Marsden, the frail vessel came in contact with the stern of a ship and was overturned. By great exertions on the part of the persons who witnessed the accident, ten of the party were rescued but the remaining seven were unfortunately drowned, and six of them being young girls their untimely fate created considerable sensation in the neighbourhood. September 21. \u2014 A serious affray took place at Ellingham, near Alnwick, between the inhabitants of the place and a party of reapers. During the disturbance an Irishman, named Bernard Dogherty, was wounded by a shot from a gun carried by Mr. James Adams, draper, from the effects of which he died. The gun was discharged by mere accident. September 26. \u2014 A fearful gale of wind from the north-east arose to-day, and great losses occurred amongst the shipping near the coast. At Sunderland the fall of rain was extraordinary, and an immense amount of damage was done. About a mile of railway along the shore was totally washed away, and a black smith's shop shared the same fate. Many ships, principally in the coal trade, were lost at sea during the gale, and a considerable number of their crews. September. \u2014 During this month, whilst some excavations were being made at High Rochester, Northumberland (the Roman Bremenium), a very fine alter was discovered with an inscription proving that the station had been garrisoned by the first cohort of the Varduli, as stated in the Itinerary of Antoninus. October 10. \u2014 The High Sheriff of Northumberland (Sir Horace St. Paul, bart ), by an advertisement of this date, proposed to give three prizes amounting to \u00a3315, as well as three silver vases, for the best three essays on \" Temperance physiologically, religiously, and statistically considered.\" Several essays by writers of acknowledged talent were sent in, but the prizes have never been awarded. October 18. \u2014 Died, at Munich, aged 76, Isaac Cookson, esq., of Meldon Park, Northumberland. He was Mayor of Newcastle in 1809-10. October 31. \u2014 An explosion of gas took place in West Moor Colliery, near Newcastle, by which nine of the miners were killed and six seriously burnt. One hundred and thirty persons were in the mine at the time of the accident, but the effects of the"], [277, "A.D. 1852. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 271 explosion were confined to a small portion of the workings. It was stated at the inquest that the mine had seventy miles of air passages. 1851 (November 3/\u2014 A boiler explosion occurred at the factory of Messrs. Waterson, Curds and Cream House, near Newcastle, by which Mr. George Waterson, one of the firm, lost his life, and a workman was severly scalded. November 10. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected mayors and sheriffs for the ensuing year : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 James Hodgson, esq., mayor ; Isaac Lothian Bell, esq , sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 Charles John Pearson, esq. Tynemouth \u2014 Alexander Bartleman, esq. South Shields \u2014 John Clay, esq. Sunderland \u2014 James Hartley, esq. Durham \u2014 Richard Thompson, esq.

Berwick \u2014 William Smith, esq., mayor ; John Pratt, esq., sheriff November 21. \u2014 This day the Sunderland Joint Stock Banking Company stopped payment. The paid-up capital of the concern was only \u00a375,000, and the deposits amounted to about \u00a330,000. The deficiency was found to be about \u00a324,000, or \u00a35 per share. The conduct of the directors was stated by the committee appointed by the shareholders to have been reckless, deceptive, and im provident to a degree almost unparalleled, and the shareholders dismissed them from their office with great indignation. In June, 1857, it was announced that the liabilities of the bank had been wholly paid off. December 2. \u2014 Early this morning a fire broke out in North Shields Theatre, and in less than three hours the entire building, with the valuable scenery, properties, and wardrobe, were com pletely destroyed. The erection and its contents, which together were worth upwards of \u00a33,000, were the property of Mr. Roxby, and it was supposed that the fire had arisen from a spark dropped during the performance. The theatre was first opened on the 5th of November, 1 783, by Mr. CawdeU, the then manager, on the site of a building which had been used as a place of detention for prisoners taken during the French war, and the house was for several years under the management of the celebrated Stephen Kemble. April, 1852, whilst workmen were excavating the ground, preparatory to building a new theatre, three coffins were found a sew feet below the surface. December 12. \u2014 Died, at North Shields, aged 39, Mr. George Whitehead Hearn, professor of mathematics at Sandhurst College. Mr. Hearn was a native of North Shields, and when very young exhibited proofs of great mathematical ability. He subsequently wrote in several scientific works, and highly distinguished himself at Cambridge, where he was sixth wrangler in 1839. His writings were always distinguished by clearness and originality, as well as by an elegant and elaborate mode of investigation. 1852 (January). \u2014 The weather was so mild at this time that strawberries were gathered in some gardens near Tynemouth in"], [278, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1852. 272 the first week of this year, and an apple tree, at Wallsend, belonging to Mr. Crozier, was covered with blossoms. 1852 (January 4/\u2014 Died, at North Shields, aged 106, Mrs. Hannah Gibbons. January 10. \u2014 In consequence of a high wind from the north east, the tide rose to an unusual height in Shields harbour, and nearly 100 feet of the wall at Clifford's Fort was carried away. A number of vessels broke from their moorings, and during the day the Blackett and Ridley, one of the oldest colliers in the trade, was lost at sea. Much damage was done to the new docks, at Sunderland, and the lighthouse on the south pier was almost washed away by the waves. January 16. \u2014 A person, named Christopher Wilkinson, employed in Chester-le-Street Brewery, and his son, Robert, were drowned whilst endeavouring to cross the river Wear near that place in a cart, the river being much flooded at the time. February 24.\u2014 Died, at Sunderland, aged 59, Mr. Thomas Pigg. The deceased, in his younger days, followed tbe laborious employment of a coal trimmer, and was, up to the age of 37, so ignorant of the rules of arithmetic as to be unable to calculate his wages, but by excessive application and perseverance he became one of the first mathematicians in the North of England, and for many years answered the most difficult problems in the \" Ladies' Diary.\" He contributed to several mathematical periodicals, and was extensively known and appreciated by scientific men. April 24.\u2014 Died, at Sedgefield, aged 104, Mr. John Piles, for seventy-four years in the services of the Russell family at Brancepeth. May 5. \u2014 A green linnet's nest, with the moss, hair, and other materials in a good state of preservation, was found in the centre of a solid log of English elm, which was being cut up in the yard ol Mr. Lumsden, block maker, Monkwearmouth. May 6. \u2014 A fearful explosion of gas took place in Hebburn Colliery, near Newcastle, the property of Messrs. Easton and Co. Two hundred workmen were in the mine when the calamity occurred, but the effects were confined to the Monkton Flat, in which twenty men and two boys were working, all of whom were suffocated. Fourteen of the sufferers left widows and families, and, as a proof of the uncertainty of life amongst miners, one of the women had lost two husbands in the 3ame awful manner. June 3. \u2014 As Mrs. Wood, of Newcastle, with two children and a servant, were proceeding from Tynemouth to Marsden in a pleasure boat, a thunderstorm suddenly broke over them, during which the boat was upset, and the children, together with the waterman were unfortunately drowned. Mrs. Wood and the servant were picked up by a coble belonging to Messrs. Fry, of Tynemouth. June 4. \u2014 A dreadful boiler explosion occurred at Spital Tongues Colliery, near Newcastle, by which the engineman and fireman were killed. The fragments of the boiler were thrown in"], [279, "A.D. 1852.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 273 all directions, and portions of it struck two women and inflicted serious injuries. 1852 (June 16/ \u2014 An explosion took place in Seaton Colliery, near Seaham, Durham. Six men and a boy were working at the place where the accident happened, and all of them perished. June 22. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Meiklam's b c Stilton (Aldcrof t), beating seven others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. T. E. Headlam's na Evadne (Alcroft/ beating Mr. Martinson's Nancy. June 30. \u2014 A splendid iron screw steamer, constructed by Messrs. Palmer Brothers, at Jarrow, and the first vessel of that description which had been built for the London coal trade, was launched in the presence of a numerous and influential concourse of spectators At the conclusion of the ceremony about three hundred ladies and gentlemen partook of an elegant luncheon, provided by the builders. C. Palmer, esq., presided, supported by the Mayors of Newcastle, Shields, Sunderland, and Gateshead, and several of the principal merchants of the district. The proceedings concluded with a ball, which was led off by the Mayoress of New castle and Mr. C. Palmer. The vessel, which was named the John Bowes, was 465 tons register, was calculated to carry thirty keels of coals, and to make thirty trips per annum between Newcastle and London. It was ballasted with water under a recent patent of Dr. White, of Newcastle. July 29, the vessel sailed from the Tyne with her first cargo of coals, arrived in the Thames on the 31st, and completed her return voyage to the north on the 3rd of August. July 1. \u2014 In consequence of the accession of the Earl of Derby to the head of the Government, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved this day, and writs were immediately issued for a new election. Owing to political causes the contests throughout the country were unusually numerous, and much excitement prevailed. NEWCASTLE.

July 5. \u2014 A fearful thunderstorm passed over Northumber land and Durham. At Alnwick the lightning was attracted by some long poles, used for supporting the scaffolding of some buildings then in course of erection, and killed two men who had taken shelter from the rain ; several other men being stunned. At Matfen ice fell in large masses, and immense damage was done to the fields and gardens, many trees being completely stripped of foliage. At Swinehope two persons were killed by the lightning while sitting in a bedroom. At High House, Weardale, a boy, named Redshaw, was killed ; and at Brier Hill, in the same locality, a boy, named Beck, was struck dead. At Bensham two men, named Britley and Penman, were killed. At Bankwell-stairs, Gateshead, two children, named Avery, were killed by the fall of an old wall, which was forced down by the accumulation of water. Throughout the valleys of the Tyne and Wear a vast destruction of agricultural property took place, owing to the immense quantity of rain which fell; and, altogether, the storm was ofthe most disastrous kind. During another violent storm on the following day the railway bridge over the brook at Allerwash, near Hexham, was carried away whilst a train was passing over it, but the passengers escaped unhnrt, though the guard had a narrow escape, being carried across the river, and from which he was with some difficulty rescued.

The party was received in the Assembly Rooms by the Mayor (James Hodgson esq.), who presented Lord Talbot de Malahide, the president, with an address from tbe council of the borough expressing its gratification at the visit of the institute. Lord Talbot in his address referred to the services rendered to arch \u00e6ology by various residents in the district, and more particularly by the late Mr. Thomas Hodgson, the Rev. J. Hodgson, Mr. Surtees, and Sir Cuthbert Sharpe ; also to the Duke of Northumber land, the Rev. Jas. Raine, Mr. Hudson Turner, and Sir John Swinburne. After various sectional meetings, and papers read on divers subjects, on the 26 th, the members sat down to the Anniversary Dinner, in the Assembly Rooms, Lord Talbot presided, supported on his right by Mrs. Mayoress, the Duke of Northumberland, the Earl of Carlisle, the Hon. H. T. Liddell, Mr. P. M. Howard, and Mr. J. Clayton ; and on his left by the Mayor, Lord Lovaine, Sir E. Blackett, bart., Sir W. Riddell, bart, Mr. J. H. Hinde, Mr. Headlam, M.P., &c, &c. On the 27th a numerous party visited Morpeth, Bothal, Warkworth, Alnwick Castle, and Hulne Abbey. This Abbey is a place of considerable antiquity, being the first monastery established by the Carmelite Friars in the kingdom. It is situated about three miles from Alnwick, on a sloping eminence, its ivyed ruins hanging beautifully by the side of the river, in a woody and delightful solitude. A strong tower was built in the monastery by Henry Percy, fourth Earl of Northumberland, as a place of refuge for the monks in times of danger. This tower is the best preserved portion of the ruins, and bears the following curious inscription : \u2014 Km t\\t gm ai <\u00a3|rrat ||w m.coc.iiii.viii Sp ftoixt fan WRrrir hg #fc Eettry f tttg %\\t iaxxttl} t&tk of gotfynbtih'i) at pti \\axtrs & foflrijr \u00ae|rai t%$Bmta KJauir g6 a,aao %\\xoxt full of frrrfiu aulr bttott lattg^tr. ta \u00a7,t Millm %Ktbxt rig|rt noblt xxxb fcarirg \u20acrl* ai \"gtmhrotl fa^as souliss gob- sabs. &nir foith \\h %mt tnztist ge ViVan as fjris $,aiat- Some of the less dilapidated portions of the Abbey are fitted up, and inhabited by persons who have charge of an avairy which has been established there by order of his grace.

They then proceeded by train to Burdon Mill, where conveyances were prepared for assisting the party to the celebrated Roman Station of Borcovicus (the '\u2022 Tadmor of Britain\"), upon the Great Wall. Here the Rev. J. C. Bruce performed the duties of guide with great ability, and a lengthy tour along the remains of"], [283, "A.D. 1852.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 277 the still magnificent barrier. Ample justice was done to the generous hospitality of John Clayton, esq., the owner of the station. September lst, the final meeting took place, in the Assembly Rooms, when the Rev. J. C. Bruce read a paper on the \" Excavation at Rochester\" (Bremenium). Rochester is situated in Watling-street, about eight miles north-west from Elsdon, above nine miles north of Risingham, and twenty of the Wall. This was the capital, or chief fortress of the Ottadini ; and afterwards became a distinguished station of the Romans, by whom it was called Bremenium. Richard numbers Bremenium among the twelve stipendiary cities in Britain. It is conjectured to have obtained this name from being Castrum in Rupe, which is the true descrip tion of its site, it being placed on the brow of a steep and rocky hill ; or rather, as Camden calls it, a rocky mountain, commanding the pass of Redesdale. On every hand the prospect is horrible, except the narrow valley, watered by the Reed, which is looked down upon from this rugged eminence. Camden, two centuries ago, thus describes the surrounding country : \u2014 \u25a0' There are hills hard by so boggy, and standing with water on their summits, that no horseman are able to ride through them.\" And again, \" Moun tains, desert, and impassible, such as this tract is.\" The same writer observes, \" That Ptolemy, speaking of Rremenium, places it in this very site, and part of the country ; and from thence Antonine begins his first journey in Britain, as from the utmost limit of the Roman province at that time. When the barbarous nations had broken through the wall of Antoninus Pius, and would in conse quence hurry over and lay waste all the country before them, the wall of Hadrian lying neglected to the time of Severus, we may necessarily admit that this station was regarded as the limit of the empire, from whence the old Itinerary, which bears the title of Antonine's, began, viz. a Limitis. The construction given it, to imply a Vallo, is only a gloss put on it by the transcriber.\" This station was esteemed the strongest the Romans had in the north, and was defended by three ramparts of earth and a wall. Votes of thanks to the Mayor and Corporation, to the nobility and gentry of the district, &c, &c, were carried by acclamation, and the interesting proceedings terminated by the Mayor proposing a vote of thanks to the noble president for the great ability, courtesy, and kindness he had exhibited throughout the meeting. 1852 (September 7). \u2014 A public dinner was given in the Corn Market, Newcastle, to Henry George Liddell, esq , M.P., in com memoration of his return for South Northumberland. The chair was taken by Sir M. W. Ridley, bart , the vice-presidents being J. B. Coulson, esq., J. H. Hinde, esq., and R. Errington, esq. Nearly 400 gentlemen sat down to a very sumptuous dinner, and the proceedings of the evening were of a highly pleasing and enthu siastic character. September 8. \u2014 A public dinner was given to William Ord, esq., of Whitfield, in the Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, on his retire ment from Parliament, and in testimony of the high esteem"], [284, "278 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1852. entertained by his late constituents of his public services as a member of the House of Commons during a period of fifty years. The chair was taken by James Hodgson, esq., who was supported on his right by Mr. Ord, the Earl of Carlisle, Mr. Blackett, M.P , Sir W. C. Trevelyan, bart., Mr. Hutt, M.P., the Hon. F. Grey, Mr. P. H. Howard, and Mr. Alderman Lamb ; and on his left by Earl Grey, the Earl of Durham, Mr. Headlam M.P., Mr. Beaumont, M.P., Mr. Carter, M.P., Mr. Ingham, M.P., Mr. G. Ridley, Dr. Headlam, and Sir John Fife. The vice-chairs were filled by the sheriff of Newcastle (I. L. Bell, esq.), Mr. J. Losh, and Mr. M. R. Bigge. About 200 gentlemen sat down to dinner, and amongst those who had intimated their regret at being unable to attend were the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord John Russell, the Earl of Zetland, Lord Panmure, Lord Colborne, and Sir James Graham. 1852 (October 6 and 7). \u2014 The extensive estates of North and South Gosforth, Seaton Burn, and Coxlodge, the property of the Rev. R. H. Brandling, were sold by auction at the Queen's Head Inn, Newcastle, by order of the Court of Chancery, Mr. Alderman Farebrother, of London, auctioneer. Amongst the principal lots, the manor of North and South Gosforth, 790 acres in extent, was bought by Mr. T. Smith for \u00a325,200 ; Low Gosforth Estate was purchased by Joseph Laycock, esq., for \u00a320,000 ; Seaton Burn House, Six Mile Bridge Farm, and Coxlodge Farm were sold to Mr. Riddell Robson for \u00a324,000 ; High and Low Weetslade, Wideopen, and Brunton Farms were knocked down to Mr. Smith for \u00a346,000.

December 6. \u2014 An extraordinary and fatal accident occurred this evening, in Northumberland-court, Newcastle. It appeared that a Mr. William Glover, who occupied the upper room in a tenement house, had frequently missed articles from his room, and being of an ingenious turn of mind, he had, some time before, devised a plan to prevent all intrusion for the future. Having got a large horse-pistol loaded with slugs, he attached the trigger in such a manner to the door of the apartment that any one entering caused the pistol to explode, but he was able to admit himself by pulling a string, which passed through the frame of the door. On"], [285, "A.D. 1853.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 279 the above evening, however, he had forgotten to observe the necessary precaution, when the pistol went off, and the contents killed him instantaneously. 1852 (Dtcemher 25). \u2014 The Christmas of 1852 will long be remem bered as the period of one of the most terrific storms ever known to the inhabitants of these latitudes. The previous evening gave premonitory symptoms of the coming tornado, which, during this day and up to the morning of 27th, blew down scores of chimneys and unroofed hundreds of houses in Newcastle and Gateshead. Mr. William Veitch, foreman of Messrs. Atkinson and Philipson, coach manufacturers, was passing along Maving's entry, in Pilgrim-street, on the morning of the 27th, about half past ten o'clock, when a tile fell upon him and fractured his skull so dreadfully that he died in about two hours. It may be said that the storm reached its greatest violence on the 27th. Then the fabrics that had weathered the tempest of the previous days tottered and fell, and the wind, accompanied by drenching showers, raged with a fury that threatened to tear everything to pieces, and the stoutest and stateliest buildings appeared to shake and quiver in the blast. Nothing to equal the fierceness of the tempest had been known since the well remembered hurricane of January, 1839. At Durham, Sunderland, Hartlepool, Stockton, Darlington, and many other places a great number of houses were unroofed. In the country the severity of the storm was felt on all sides with great intensity. On many farms the produce of the season was en tirely destroyed, or swept away, none knew whither, leaving the occupiers in many cases almost penniless. Amongst the habita- tions of the poorer classes in the exposed districts the damage done by the storm was exceedingly severe, many of such dwellings being reduced to a complete wreck ; and instances were not wanting in which the whole of the household chattels had shared a similar fate. The number of personal injuries sustained in the country and outlying districts was innumerable, the greater portion of which, however, were obtained though coming into contact with flying chimney pots, slates, &c , and although in many instances some ugly wounds and bruises were the result, happily in no case did such injuries terminate fatally in the district, except the case of Veitch, alluded to above. In many parts of the country trees, which had weathered tbe storms of ages, yielded to the terrifio force of this storm', and were uprooted apparently with the greatest ease ; whilst the damage done to the more tender plants was in calculable. 1853 (January 11/ \u2014A boat, containing four men, went out for a pleasure trip on the river Tees near Stockton, when, during a squall, the craft became unmanageable, and was upset, the whole of occupants being precipitated into the water. A most heartrending scene took place, the men struggling frantically to save themselves by clinging to the sides of the boat. Assistance was promptly at hand, but notwithstanding every effort was used three of the party, named Wilson, Harle, and Williamson, were drowned."], [286, "280 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1853. 1853 (February 11/ \u2014 One of the heaviest falls of snow which had occurred for many years in this district commenced this day, and continued with little intermission during the ensuing week. The railway trains, both from the north and the south, were greatly delayed, although as many as five engines were occasionally employed to one train. The turnpike roads from Newcastle to Otterburn, Shotley Bridge, and Blyth, were quite impassable for some time, and several persons lost their lives during the storm. Amongst these were Mr. John Laidler, shoemaker, Seaton Sluice, found dead on Blyth Links ; Henry Nerry, lost between Stanhope and Edmond Byers; Thomas Baron, lost near Stagshaw Bank; and Mrs. Mackenzie, who died between Percy Main and North Shields. Many disasters also occurred at sea. On the 24th the Sir William Wallace was lost upon the Herd Sands at the mouth of the Tyne, and her crew, seven men, a woman, and a boy, all perished. On the 26th a fishing boat returning to Cullercoats was upset and two men were drowned. February 26. \u2014 This evening a tremendous explosion of gas occurred in a provision shop in Buckingham-street, Newcastle, occupied by Mr. William Walker. An escape of gas had been perceived for several days previous, and the explosion occurred in consequence of Mr. Walker removing a portion of the shop floor and introducing a candle to examine the pipe. Mrs. Walker, who was standing near at the time, was blown into the street with the whole of the shop front, and was so much mutilated that she died in a few days after. March 21. \u2014 A fishing boat, called the Dean Swift, belonging to Blyth, was capsized off that place, and three men, named Armstrong, Foggin, and Dixon, were drowned. March 28. \u2014 A political banquet upon a grand scale took place at Alnwick, upon the presentation of a piece of plate to Sir George Grey, bart., M.P., by the working men of Northumberland. A large wooden pavilion was erected in the Market-place, and the tickets for admission, 1,500 in number, proved quite inadequate to supply the demand for seats. The chair was taken by Sir W. C. Trevelyan, bart. ; supported on his right by Sir G. Grey, bart., the Earl of Carlisle, Mr. Beaumont, M.P., the Hon. and Rev. J. Grey, the Rev. R. W. Goodenough, Mr. M. R. Bigge, &c. ; and on his left by Earl Grey, Lord Panmure, the Hon. and Rev. R. F. Grey, Mr Ingham, M.P., Mr. Blackett, M.P., &c\u201e &o. The vice-chair was occupied by P. Selby, esq., who was supported by the Mayors of Newcastle and Berwick, Mr. P. G. Selby, Mr. Ralph Carr, Captain Widdrington, Sir J. Gibson Craig, Mr. Ellice, jun., M.P., &c, &c. Dinner being concluded the testimonal was brought forward and displayed amidst great cheering. It consisted of a splendid silver candelabrum, supported by figures of a ploughman, a sailor, a blacksmith, and a miner, and ornamented with the arms of Morpeth, Alnwick, and Berwick. There was also a massive salver, beautifully embossed, the whole being valued at upwards of \u00a3400, and bearing the following inscription :\u2014 \" T< the Right"], [287, "a.d. 1853.

Sir George Grey, bart., G.C B., from more than 13,000 of the working classes of Northumberland, in testimony of their gratitude for his support of the just, wise, and beneficial measure of Free Trade, and their respect for his private worth, and for the eminent integrity and ability which have distinguished his public career.\" Mr. Michael Young, a clerk in the Bedlington Iron Works, presented the testimonial in a neat speech, which was much applauded, and Sir G. Grey afterwards returned thanks, in an eloquent address. Earl Grey, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Panmure, Mr. Ingham, Mr. Beaumont, and Mr J. B. Blackett also addressed the assemblage, which broke up highly delighted with the proceedings.

May 13. \u2014 This evening a fire broke out in the warehouse of Messrs. Oliver and Co., oil manufacturers, Close, Newcastle, which raged with great violence for several hours, causing a very lament able destruction of property. The warehouse adjoined the river Tyne, and was close to the High Level Bridge, but although fears were at one time entertained for the safety of that magnificent VOL III. N 1"], [288, "282 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1853. structure, they fortunately proved groundless. The principal sufferers were Mr. Ayton, corn merchant, Mr. Ridley, provision merchant, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Waterfall, and Messrs Oliver. The loss altogether was upwards of \u00a310,000. The building, which was insured, stood exactly upon the site of an extensive range of premises which were destroyed 63 years before, by one of the greatest conflagrations remembered in Newcastle. See Sykes, September Sth, 1785. 1853 (May 23/ \u2014 The largest ship hitherto built on the Tyne was launched at St. Peter's, near Newcastle, by Messrs. T. and W. Smith, in the presence of about 40,000 spectators. The vessel was named the Carlo Alberto, and was built for the Sardinian Govern ment. She was pierced for fifty guns, and subsequently fitted with a screw propeller and engines of 400 horse-power. Her burthern was 2,500 tons. June 1. \u2014 A small crab was caught amongst the rocks at Tynemouth, having a sixpence firmly attached to the shell of its back. The coin had probably fallen upon the crab when its outer covering was in a soft state, as the shell had grown considerably over the edge of the piece. June \u2014 Abont this time Messrs. Swinburne and Co., South Shields, received at their works, from the manufactory of Messrs, Hawks, Crawshaw, and Sons, Gateshead, a new cast iron table, for the purpose of casting large plate glass. The table measured in length 220 inches by 130 broad, and seven inches thick. It weighed 26 tons, and was supposed at that time to be the largest table ever planed for casting glass. June 22. \u2014 Cardinal Wiseman performed high mass this morning at Cshaw College, assisted by the titular bishops of Hexham, Beverly, Plymouth, and Salford, and 150 priests, in consequence of the Rev. Dr. Newsham having completed his fiftieth year's residence at that college. The event was celebrated with much rejoicing. In the afternoon Dr. Newsham was pre sented with his portrait. A dinner afterwards took place in the refectory, to which about 400 ladies and gentleman sat down, amongst whom was Sir W. Lawson, bart., P. H. Howard, esq., M. Salvin, esq., W. H. Charlton, esq., and E. Waterton, esq. Music and other entertainmc nts concluded the festivities. July 1. \u2014 Died, at Hawkwell, near Alnwick, aged 110, in the full possession of her iaculties, Mrs. Elizabeth Langlands July 5. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Murray's br c Kingston, beating thirteen others. The Gold Cup was won by Sir C. Monk's Vindex, beating Kingston. August 22. \u2014 As a small steamer, called the William, was proceeding from Newcastle to Shields, she was run down by the screw steamer Sir John Easthope, and the passengers and crew, about fifty in number, were left to struggle for life in the river. Owing to the exertions of some boatmen the whole were ultimately"], [289, "A.D. 1853.) REMARKABLE EVENTS. 283 rescued ; but the steersman, who had a leg broken, expired soon after, and several ofthe others were much injured. 1853 (August 26/ \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 81, the Rev. Ralph Henry Brandling, formerly of Gosforth Hall, Northumberland, and the last of a long roll of \" Brandlings of Gosforth.\" The deceased was one of the chief founders of the Natural History Society of Newcastle. His kindness and generosity to the poor, and his considerate attention to his numerous workmen, so long as he had an opportunity of manifesting it, commanded universal respect and esteem. September 1. \u2014 During the summer of this year considerable apprehension was diffused throughout the country by accounts ot the prevalence of Asiatic cholera in several cities jn Germany, and that the disease was gradually advancing westward. At last a decided case of this fearful disease was reported from London, followed soon after by similar mortality in Liverpool and Hull, and on the above date the disease appeared in a most malignant form, and almost simultaneously, in three or four parts of New- castle. It was not, however, for some days that any great alarm was felt at its presence ; but on the 9th, when between thirty and forty deaths had occurred, the attention of the inhabitants became decidedly fixed on its progress. Additional medical officers and nurses were appointed. Several druggists were directed to dispense medicines cratuitously to the poor, and numerous precautionary measures were carried out, the Board henceforth sitting nightly to superintend the arrangements. On the 16th of September, on it transpiring that the number of deaths that day exceeded 100, the consternation and dismay of the inhabitants became intense, and business was almost suspended through the terror and anxiety of all classes. The mortality of each day was declared in the evening by the Guardians, amidst great trepidation, and as the deaths showed no diminution on the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th, but were reported to have increased on the last mentioned date to the fearful number of 119, despondency and gloom were upon every face. Many persons removed their families from the town altogether, and as strangers entirely shunned its streets, the absence of traffic, save the continual tramp, tramp, tramp, and ceaseless processions to the places of interment, had a most depressing effect upon all. During this appalling fatality the Board of Guardians continued to meet daily to hear the reports of their officers. Preventive measures of every kind were put in force, wherever required, and at length, on the 24th, the disease for the first time shewed symptoms of abatement, the deaths having fallen to 59. The mortality, though liable to fluctuations, from this time sensibly declined, and in about four weeks more the town began to assume its wonted appearance. Upwards of 1,500 persons had then been swept away by it. A remarkable feature of the epidemic was the destruction which occurred in particular families. In one house, at Arthur's-hill, the father, mother, five children, and grandmother were carried oft' within a few days, and in numerous"], [290, "284 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF s_A.D. 1853. cases a husband, wife, and two or more children were recorded to have lapidly followed each other to the grave. At Gateshead the mortality was 433 ; the township of Heworth, 98 ; Whickham, 21 ; Winlaton, 14. At Hexham 25 per cent, of the whole popu lation was more or less affected, and the number of deaths 26. One medical gentleman, Mr. Farbridge, his wise and two daughters, were amongst the lamented victims. Whalton, one of the most pleasant and salubrious villages in Northumberland, was terribly afflicted by the scourge. Out the 220 inhabitants, forty-five were attacked, and twelve died. In North and South Shields thirty eight deaths took place. At Howdon the epidemic raged in its most malignant form, breaking out in the same room in the same house it made its appearance in on the previous visitations of 1831 and 1849, and nearly thirty deaths took place. At Blyth, also, about twenty fatal cases were reported, and isolated deaths occurred in several other places. 1853 (September 12J. \u2014 This evening a cab, containing a man, two women, and four children, besides the driver, was proceeding quickly along Deptford New-road, Sunderland, when, owing to the darkness of the night, it fell over into the ravine below, a depth of 40 feet, and what is remarkable, neither passengers, driver, nor horse were much hurt. October 3. \u2014 A fire broke out this morning, in the Bee Hive Inn, East Holborn, South Shields, occupied by Mr. W. Thompson. The whole of the inmates were obliged to fly from the premises in their night dresses, and the progress of the flames being accelerated by a high wind, the house and its contents were speedily consumed. November 9. \u2014 The annual election of mayors for the boroughs of Northumberland and Durham took place, when the following gentlemen were elected : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Ralph Dodds, esq., mayor ; John Gibson, esq., sheriff Gateshead \u2014 David Haggie, esq.

November 28.\u2014 Died, in London, aged 76, General Sir Thomas Bradford, G.C.B. This distinguished officer married Mary Anne, daughter of James Atkinson, esq, of Newcastle, and his eldest son, James Henry, succeeded to the estates of Ralph Atkinson, esq., of Angerton, near Morpeth, and took the name of that gentleman. The deceased was interred at Hartburn, where he had previously placed an elegant monument, by Chantry, in memory of his wife. December 16. \u2014 Died, at Hartlepool, in his seventieth year Mr. William Purvis, widely known in the northern counties as \" Billy Purvis.\" The deceased was born at Auchindinny, near Edin burgh, but was brought to Newcastle by his parents at an early age. Having been at school for some time, with Mr. Sessford he was apprenticed to Mr. John Chapman, joiner, Big\"-market."], [291, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 285 The deceased resided in the same house, in the Close, for nearly sixty-six years, ever proving himself, as far as dialect was con cerned, a devoted Newcastletonian. His propensity for the stage was indicated at an early age, and he became \" call boy\" at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, while it was under the management of Stephen Kemble. After some coquetting with the muse as an amateur, and several perambulations in the surrounding districts as a conjuror, a clown, and a performer on the Northumberland bagpipes, he finally established himself as proprietor of an itinerant theatre, about 1818, and maintained that position, doubtless with many vicissitudes, up to the day of his death. His peregrinations throughout the North of England, and in Scotland, made his name a \" household word\" in every district, and there have been few men in his station so popular with almost all orders of society. To his credit it may be added that he brought up a large family in a most respectable manner, and his contributions to the very inadequate stock of harmless pleasures will long be remembered with feelings of respect and regret. 1853 (December 30/ \u2014 A most destructive fire broke out in Bell-street, North Shields, in premises occupied by Mr. Duncan McGregor, marine store dealer, and Mr. Hutchinson, ship chandler. In the immediate vicinity were the premises of Mr. Green, grocer, Mr. Sobbs, pipe-maker, Mr. Taylor, sail-maker, and Mr. Stewart, ship owner, and, owing to the high wind which was raging, these buildings were speedily set on fire, and were entirely consumed. The damage was estimated at \u00a32,500. 1854 (January). \u2014 One of the most severe frosts that has occurred during the present century was experienced in the beginning of this month. With the exception of one date (January 15, 1815), when Mr, Losh's observations at Jesmond recorded the temperature at 8 deg., and a second in 1838, when, at Prudhoe, the thermometer was observed at 5, and at Ryton, 3 deg., being 29 deg. below freezing. On the 3rd the wind, which for several days had been north-west, veered suddenly round to south-east, and the tempera ture rose considerably. The change of wind, however, had a most disastrous effect upon the shipping near the coast, as about 1,500 vessels had left Yarmouth Roads tor the north, and their attempts to reach their destination became extremely hazardous, owing to the violence of the storm. On the 4th the fleet was off Tynemouth, and although some hundreds of vessels entered in safety, a great number ot others got upon the Herd Sands aud the opposite rocks. The scene was of the most exciting character. The tempestuous sea dashing its foaming billows over the venerable ruins at Tyne mouth ; the noise of the noble vessels breaking up, crash after crash, mixed up with the distant and unharmonious scream of the sea-foul in the narrows ; the wreckage and material strewed along the harbour, with an armed body of police, with drawn swords, attempting to guard the remains of the scattered property, was alto gether a scene characteristic of our iron bound coast, at this season of the year. At Sunderland twelve vessels were driven behind"], [292, "286 [A.D 1854 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF the north pier, and two behind the south pier, twelve went aground upon the potato-garth, and five1 more at Polka Hole, one third of which became total wrecks. At Hartlepool, eight laden vessels grounded upon the bar and became wrecks, and a still larger number were driven ashore near the mouth of the Tees. All along the coast, indeed, the loss of life and property was very serious. After a temporary calm the gale again arose on the 7th, and continued to rage with fearful violence until the morning of the 10th. This second hurricane proved more disastrous than its predecessor, owing to the disabled state of many of the vessels still at sea, and at the conclusion of the storm sixty ships had been wrecked between the mouth of the Tees and Hartlepool, forty at Sunderland, thirty-four at Tynemouth, ten at Warkworth, and about forty others at various places in the neighbourhood, besides many which were supposed to have foundered at sea. The loss at the mouth of the Tyne alone was estimated at \u00a350,000, On the afternoon of the 7th a calamitous disaster took place at Newbiggen, which resulted in the total loss of a Norwegian ship called the Embla. The ill-fated vessel and her crew, 13 in number, were lost under very melancholy circumstances, from the refusal of the men who had charge of the lifeboat stationed there to got out. The ship struck on the beach, and for nearly four hours was the sport of the breakers when she went to pieces and all was over. The captain was washed ashore in the course of the evening, and, when found, his body was still warm. Upon his person were found 25 sovereigns and 5 Norwegian notes, together with a letter written by a lady named Lousia Hansen, of Christiana, in terms of the fondest endearment, and addressed to Captain Gustavus Kock. He was a remarkably handsome man, about 26 years of age, and was buried on the Ilth at the neighbouring village of Woodhorn. 1854 (January 13. \u2014 At a meeting ofthe committee ofthe Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle, Mr. Fenwick stated that he and Mr. Kell were commissioned by Robert Stephenson, esq., M.P., one of the vice-presidents, to inform the committee that, feeling grateful lor the advantages which he had derived from the library when a young man, and being anxious to extend the same advantages to others, that gentleman was prepared to pay one-half of the debt of the institution (\u00a36,200), upon condition that the other friends of the society should discharge the remainder of the debt before the next anniversary, and that the annual subscription should be reduced to one guinea. Mr. Stephenson afterwards extended the period for paying off the debt to February, 1856. January 17. \u2014 Died, at Douglas, Isle of Man, aged 65, John Martin, R.A. This great artist was born at East Land Ends, near Haydon Bridge, Northumberland.

In 1806 he removed with his master to London, and Martin, after passing some time there with Mr. Musso, junior, a celebrated enamel painter, supported himself by painting on glass and by teaching. His first picture was painted in the year 1812. The subject was \" Sadak in search of the Waters of oblivion,\" and of this Martin himself said, \" You may easily guess my anxietv when I overhead the men who were to put it in the frame disputing as to which was the top of the picture.\" The work was, however, sold for fifty guineas. His next works were \" Paradise,\" \" The Expulsion,\" \" Clytie,\" \"Joshua,\" \"Fall of Babylon,\" \"Macbeth,\" \" Belshazzar's Feast,\" (which gained the prize of \u00a3200 at the British Institution), \" The Destruction of Herculaneum,\" \" The Seventh Plague,\" \" Satan in Pandemonium,\" \" The Paphian Bower,\" \" The Creation,\" \" The Deluge,\" and \" The Fall of Nineveh.\" These are the works by which he is most known, although many others of high merit might be mentioned. He received 2,000 guineas for his illustrations of Milton, which added greatly to his reputation. He left partially unfinished three large works, \" The Last Judgment,\" \" The Great Day of His Wrath,\" and \"The Plains of Heaven,\" which at the time of his death were being exhibited in Newcastle. Besides his professional studies Mr. Martin was the author of several schemes, several of which were exceedingly ingenious and useful. 18b4(February 18/ \u2014 By order ofthe Queen in Council the burial grounds connected with the various churches of Newcastle were ordered to be immediately closed. By subsequent orders the churchyards at North and South Shields, Sunderland, Alnwick, and other towns were also closed. February 18. \u2014 The friends of Mr. I' Anson, surgeon, Arthur's hill, Newcastle, gave him a complimentary dinner at the Blenheim Inn, Marlborough-street, Mr. John Gibson, builder, in the chair, after which a silver tea service, accompanied with a gold watch, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, with suitable inscriptions thereon, was presented by Mr. Gilmore, in the names of upwards of 300 subscribers, principally of the Westgate town ship, as a testimonial of their esteem for his character, and as a mark of their appreciation of his exertions during the late visita tion of cholera. March 6. \u2014 Died, at Holderness House, Park Lane, London, aged 76, Charles William Vane Stewart, Marquis of Londonderry. His lordship was born in 1778, and in 1804 married Lady Caroline Bligh, first daughter of the third Earl of Darnley, who died in 1812; and he married, secondly, in 1819, Lady Francis Anne, only daughter of Sir Harry Vane Tempest, bart., and Anne Countess of Antrim. The immense possessions to which this lady was heiress, together with the fact of her being a ward in Chancery, attracted at the time a great deal of public interest. In 1814 the deceased, in recognition of his distinguished services, was called to the peerage of the United Kingdom by the title of Baron Stewart. On the calamitous death of his elder brother"], [294, "288 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [AD. 1854. (Viscount Castlereagh) the late peer succeeded to the Irish honour of his family. In 1823 his lordship was created Earl Vane and Viscount Seaham in the British Peerage. The marquis was a Knight of the Garter, and amongst other honours conferred on him by his own and by foreign sovereigns was that of the highest grade of the Order of the Bath, the St. George of Russia, the Black and Red Eagles of Russia, the Tower and Sword of Portugal, the Sword of Sweden, &c, &c. He was also Custos Rotalorum of the Counties of Londonderry and Down, and Lord Lieutenant of the County Palatine of Durham. From his two estates, Wynyard Park and Seaham Hall, and his extensive colliery concerns in Durham, he derived a large income and possessed much influence. The funeral took place on the 16th at Long Newton Church, the burial place of the ancient families of Vane and Tempest, and, although the proceedings were as private as possible, a large number of the neighbouring inhabi tants assembled to pay the last tribute of respect to the deceased. After the body followed the usual accompaniment of a soldier's funeral : his horse led by a groom. In the first mourning coach were the chief mourners, Lord Castlereagh, Lord Seaham, and Lord Portarlington ; in the next were the pall bearers, His Grace the Duke of Cleveland, the Marquis of Camden, Lord Hatherston, General Brown, Colonel M'Dowell, and Colonel Williams, &c. The funeral ceremony was conducted by the Rev. T. H. Dyke, rejtor, in the presence of a crowded and deeply impressed congre gation. At Durham, Sunderland, Stockton, and Seaham Harbour the funeral of the Lord-Lieutenant of the county was observed by the closing of shops, tolling of bells, and other solemn manifesta tions. The deceased entered the army as au ensign in the year 1794, and saw some service in the unfortunate expedition to Holland, in the course of which he received a severe wound. All throughout the Peninsular operations there was no more gallant officer than Charles Stewart. He was among the last to quit the beach at Corunna. During the subsequent campaigns his name was always honourably mentioned. At Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes D'Onor, and Badajoz he highly distinguished himself. 1854 (March 31). \u2014 Her Majesty's proclamation of war against Russia was received by the mayors of the various towns in this district, and was published in the usual manner. April 1. \u2014 Died, at Greenwich, aged 67, Edward Riddel, esq., F.R.S. The deceased was bom at Otterburn, Northumberland, from whence he removed to Whitburn, near Sunderland, and afterwards, through the recommendation of Dr. Hutton, was appointed master of the Trinity House School, Newcastle, which he conducted sot seven years, proving himself of the greatest service to the nautical education of the port. Whilst in that situation he made an extensive series of lunar observations to ascertain the exact longitude of Newcastle, and discovered the mean longitude to be 1 deg. 37 min. 17 sec. W. These observa tions are given in his \" Remarks on the Present state of Nautical"], [295, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 289 Astronomy,\" in 1821. In the same year, through the influence of his early friend, Dr. Hutton, he became head master of the Greenwich Hospital Schools, where he remained until the period of his retirement, in 1851. His son, John Riddle, F.R.A.S., succeeded his father at Greenwich. 1854 (June 14/ \u2014 As Mr. Thomas Burnet, of Summerhill-grove, Newcastle, was returning from his country residence, near Winlaton, to Newcastle, in company with three of his daughters in a ph\u00e6ton, the horse took fright, when Mr. Burnet was thrown out and so severly injured that he died in a few hours. The young ladies escaped with trifling injuries, but a child was run over by the horse and killed. June 14. \u2014 A number of the old pupils connected with the St. Nicholas' School, Carliol-square, Newcastle, presented their late master (Mr. J. Findley) with a handsome silver watch and gold chain, together with an address expressive of their esteem and regard for his long and faithful services in connection with the school. The address was elegantly written'on parchment, mounted in a neat gilt frame, and signed by the whole of the contributors. June 15. \u2014 This being the day appointed for the ceremony of laying the foundation stones of the piers at the mouth of the Tyne, the River Commissioners, as well as the Corporation of the town, assembled in the Guildhall. Soon after ten o'clcok they formed in procession, Joseph Cowen, esq., chairman of the commissioners, and Joseph Straker, esq., of North Shields, heading the procession, followed by John Clayton, esq., the Vicar of Newcastle, the Sheriff, and other members of the Corporation. As the procession started from the Quayside a salute of guns was fired, every quay on each side of the river was decorated with flags, and the flotilla was received with the liveliest demonstrations of joy. The pro cession, on landing at South Shields, was met by the Corporation, and, after the interchange of cordial greetings, a complimentary address was read by Alderman Potts and was warmly responded to. After a short delay the procession then left the landing place with countless flags and banners, and several bands of music playing national airs. On arriving at the appointed place, the following inscription, placed beneath the bed of the foundation stone and engraven on brass, was read by Mr. Cowen : \u2014 \" The Foundation of this South Pier was laid on the 15th day of June, 1854, by Joseph Cowen, esq., Chairman of the Tyne Improvement Commis sioners, with the following Commissioners : \u2014 Ralph Dodds, esq , Mayor of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Matthew Popplewell, esq., Mayor of Tynemouth, John Robinson, esq., Mayor of South Shields, Commander William Purdo, R.N., John Carr, William Armstrong, William Linskill, John Clay, esqrs. and aldermen, and Thomas Ridley, John Ormston, John Rayne, Christian Allhusen, John Cuthbert Potts, Joseph Straker, John Walker Lamb, Wm.

O 1"], [296, "290 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1854. The ceremony of laying the stone having been gone through, on the part of Mr. Cowen, the Rev. W. Bradshaw, Incumbent of St. Stephens, South Shields, offered up an appropriate prayer, and the foundation was declared to be laid, amidst loud and continued applause. The chairman of the commissioners and James Mather, esq., then briefly addressed the assembly on the auspicious cere mony of the day, and the proceedings on the south side of the Tyne were announced to be terminated. The scene at North Shields was even more imposing than on the other side of the river. On the procession arriving at Tynemouth, and while moving down the banks towards the Haven, one of the most pleasing, animating, and splendid spectacles ever beheld broke in upon the sight. Upon the rocks and around the slopes of the Haven were seen thousands of people, while floating in the bay and in the offing were several gaily decorated steamers, besides four life-boats, and numerous other craft of all dimensions, and these commingling together, aided by the fineness of the day, made up a scene worthy of the talents of any artist. The ceremony of the south side having been repeated, Mr. Cowen then made a short speech to which the Mayor of Tynemouth replied, the band struck up \" God Save the Queen,\" and a salute was fired by the garrison. The Mayor of Tynemouth gave a sumptuous entertainment at the George Tavern, to the commissioners and to the corporations of the neighbouring towns. Owing to the neglect and indifference of the Admiralty, the plans of the undertaking were delayed until September 1855, when Mr. B. Lawton's offer to construct the north pier of 14,000 feet, and the south pier of 28,000 feet, for \u00a3166,000, was accepted, and the works were commenced. The original intention was for the north pier to be 21,000 and the south 42,000 feet. 1854 (June 20/ \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Lieut-Col. Bigge's Grapeshot (Ashmall), beating Kingston, Hunca Munca, and thirteen others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Morris's Kingston (Marston), beating Goldfinch and Goorkah. July 21. \u2014 This evening, about ten o'clock, an alarming fire broke out in a large bark-mill, occupied by Messrs. Priestman and Co, tanners, situated in Low Friar-street, Newcastle, a building, the destruction of which has been once before recorded in this volume (see page 17/ After that fire the mill had been constructed on a larger scale, with store rooms above, and the machinery was driven by steam. The lower storey of the mill was filled with shumac, and the building also contained seventy tons of bark and a large quantity of leather, these, together with the machinery, were entirely consumed. Considerable damage was also done to neighbouring property, and the loss was estimated at \u00a33,000. August 19. \u2014 A young man, named Andrew Cochrane, was drowned this morning, near Whitley, in attempting to save a servant girl, named Armstrong, who had been carried out by the"], [297, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 291 ebb current whilst bathing. The poor girl was also lost in conse quence of no assistance being at hand. Mr. Cochrane belonged to Newcastle. 1854 (September 12/ \u2014 The foundation-stone of the Northumber land Dock at Hayhole, near Howdon, on the Tyne, was laid by Joseph Cowen, esq., chairman of the River Commissioners. As a proof of the magnitude of the project \u2014 the dock is capable of containing 600 ships of various tonnage, and covers an extent of nearly 73 acres, and cost nearly \u00a3200,000, The stonework forming the bottom of the dock is Cornish granite, some of the blocks weighing nearly 10 tons. The dock is from the designs of Mr. Brooks, Engineer to the River Commissioners. October 6. \u2014 The most terrible and appalling catastrophe which ever occurred in the towns of Newcastle and Gateshead took place at an early hour this morning, under the following circumstances: \u2014 Shortly before one o'clock afire was discovered in the worsted manufactory of Messrs. J. Wilson and Sons, fronting the river, and situate in Hillgate, Gateshead, a building which had only recently arisen upon the site of a fire which took place on the 9th of October, 1850. The manufactory, which was of consider able height, was stored with wool in various stages of manufacture, and contained, also, a quantity oil, &c, and the inflammability of these articles offered such food to the flames that in less than an hour the building was entirely gutted from roof to cellar. On the east side of Messrs. Wilson's manufactory stood a warehouse, about a 100 yards in length by 18 in breadth, originally built for storing goods by Messrs. Bertram and Spencer, and had been used as a free warehouse for the storage of merchandise. At the time of the fire it was stored with 200 tons of iron, 800 tons of lead, 170 tons of manganese, 130 tons of nitrate of soda, 3000 tons of brim stone, 400 tons cf guano, 10 tons of alum, 5 tons of arsenic, 30 tons of copperas, 1| tons of naptha, and 240 tons of salt. The intense heat from the manufactory placed this building in great jeopardy, and streams of vivid blue flame proceeding from the sulphur soon poured from the doors upon the various flats, and afforded a most extraordinary spectacle. The most strenuous efforts were made by the fireman, as well as by the soldiers of the 26th Regiment, but perfectly in vain, and by three o'clock the whole range was one immense sheet of fire. The alarm had by this time spread in every direction, and had attracted a large number of the inhabitants of both towns to the scene. The Quay side, Newcastle, affording a full view of the burning property, was deeply set with spectators, but not the slightest apprehension was felt of any outbreak in Newcastle, and the crowd was fortunately much smaller than it would otherwise have been ; but in Gates head, where the dwellings of many thousand persons were in close proximity to the flames, and the alarm was naturally intense, every spot was thickly studded with spectators. At about ten minutes past three a slight report, like that of a rifle, was heard, but it occasioned no movement, and was thought merely accidental ; but"], [298, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1854. 292 about three minutes after it was followed by an awful explosion, which rocked with a fearful sound the whole town to its founda tions, and which no description can give the slightest idea of. The burning piles of brimstone, with bricks, stones, metal, and articles of every description were thrown up with the force of a volcanic eruption, only to fall with corresponding momentum upon the dense masses of the people assembled, and upon all the surrounding habitations. The crowd upon the Quayside and Sandhill was mown down as if by a discharge of artillery, many being rendered insensible from the shock, others temporarily suffocated by the vapour, and many more wounded by the flying debris. An awful calm succeeded for a few seconds, and then, as most of the sufferers regained their consciousness, an appalling wail of distress arose in all directions, but many were far removed from all earthly suffering, aud their voices were never heard again. The fearful extent of the calamity was now perceptible. The ignited missiles had pene trated into three houses upon the Quayside, standing exactly opposite the fire, to such a prodigious extent, that they were in flames in every storey in less than five minutes. The ships lying in the river were nearly blown out of the water by the concussion, and their shrouds were set on fire by the projectiles. Many scores of houses were entirely unroofed, the descending rubbish doing fearful injury. The shop fronts and windows upon the Quayside, the Sandhill, the Side, and all the neighbouring streets, were almost universally blown out, and the gas lights, for a square mile around the spot, were extinguished in a moment, adding a weird and horrible confusion to the scene. The streets rapidly filled with the entire population of the lower parts of Newcastle, hundreds of them in their night clothes, and seriously injured. The blood begrimed countenances of many, and the shrieks, wailing, and lamentations to be heard on every side, commingling with the voices of others devoutly calling upon the Lord to have mercy upom them, made up a scene which has been seldom paralleled. As the uninjured regained their presence of mind every endeavour was made to render relief to the wounded. The latter were at first laid on the pavement round the Fish Market, in the most melancholy confusion, and afterwards removed to the Infirmary, and never were the resources of that great charity so severely tried. Fifty-eight persons, seriously injured, were immediately admitted into the hospital, fifteen of whom died there, and sixty three others were relieved as \" out patients.\" Such were the first effects of the calamity in Newcastle, but the worst remains to be told. The long and narrow street in Gateshead, called Hillgate, where the fire broke out, was filled with people at the time of tho explosion, the firemen, the police, and various assistants being within a dozen yards of the burning pile. A number of influential inhabitants were also present, rendering every assistance in their power, and amongst them were : \u2014 Mr. Robert Pattison, tanner, a member of the Newcastle Council ; Mr. Charles Bertram, a magistrate of Gateshead ; Mr. Henry Harrison, basket-maker ;"], [299, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 293 Mr. William Davidson, son of Mr. Davidson, miller, (whose exten sive premises were within a few feet of the fire, and were after wards consumed) ; Mr. Alex Dobson, son of John Dobson, esq , architect ; Mr. Thomas Sharp, a gentleman of independent means ; and several others. In this narrow gorge the burning rubbish fell in tons together, burying the gentlemen we have named, together with Ensign Paynter \u2014 who was at the head of a company of the 26th Regiment in Church Walk \u2014 and many others several feet deep. Of course their death under such circumstances must have been instantaneous Others, again, were suffocated by the deadly fumes, while a third section perished by the falling of the surrounding houses which were thrown into one mass of ruins. Whether the loss of life was accurately obtained at the time is yet a matter of opinion, but the total number known to have perished was no less than fifty-three Of course the explosion greatly increased the extent of the fire in Gateshead. The vinegar works of Messrs. Singers and Co., which adjoined the warehouse, soon fell a prey to the flames ; the fellmongery of Messrs. Wilson was also burnt down, and several private dwellings shared the same fate. But on the Newcastle side of the river the destruction was more awful and alarming still. It has already been said that the fire broke out in three houses opposite the warehouse iu Gateshead. The shops on the ground floors of these premises were occupied by Messrs. Smith and Co., drapers; Messrs. Ormston and Smith, stationers ; and Mr. Harbottle, draper, and the stock in all was valuable. Besides these premises the shop of Messrs, Spencer and Son, drapers, and the offices above (one of which was occupied by Mr. Bertram whose death has just been recorded) were almost entirely reduced to ruins, by stones projected from the site of the explosion. The property immediately behind Messrs. Ormston and Smith's, was the Dun Cow, in the occupation of Mr. Teasdale, and the spirits which it contained immediately gave increased energy to the flames, which consumed the whole fabric in less than half-an-hour. The fire then gradually pro gressed both north and east, making its way in the first direction up Grind ing-chare, principally through old warehouses, toward the Butcher-bank ; and in the second, along the range of buildings on the Quayside. The shops of Mr. Aikin, bookseller, Mr. Turnbull, watchmaker, and the Grey Horse Inn, succeeded Messrs. Smith and Co., and the flames again ran north, up Blue Anchor-chare and Pallister's chare towards the Butcher-bank, and again extended along the Quayside. The shops of Mr. Snowdon, grocer, and the Sun Inn, intervened between Pallister's chare and Peppercorn-chare, where the flames made another run to the north of Colvin's-chare and Hornsby's-chare. By six o'clock the fire had spread along the Quayside for nearly one hundred and twenty yards, while the extent of the fire towards the Butcher-bank was rather greater, it having travelled up the whole length of Blue Anchor-chare, Peppercorn-chare, Pallister's chare, and Hornsby's-chare, and made a breach into the Butcher-"], [300, "[A.D 1854. 294 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF bank by three separate houses, all of which were entirely consumed. All this time a third fire was raging. At the time of the explosion a large blazing beam of timber was thrown high over the Butcher-bank and fell into the workshops of Mr. J. Edgar, situate behind his premises in Pilgrim-street. Here the flames worked their way uncontrolled, destroying a front shop occupied by Mrs. Ann Shield, grocer, on one side, and a large number of tenemented dwellings and workshops adjoining the George's-stairs on the other. By this time the sun had risen, and never, perhaps, had his rays exhibited Newcastle in so awful a state. The fire was still extending widely amongst the property near the Quayside, whilst the flames in Gateshead were quite unsubdued. Owing to the fire-engines having been almost entirely buried in the ruins and the serious injuries that had been sus tained by the firemen, there were no adequate means available for checking the progress of the flames. The engine of the North- Eastern Railway Company was fortunately uninjured aud proved of great service on the Quayside. Communications were sent by telegraph to all the neighbouring towns for assistance in the emergency. The floating engines at Shields and Sunderland, three land engines from the latter town, and one each from Hexham, Durham, Morpeth, and Berwick, were sent by the authorities of these places by the most expeditious means available, and the supply of water from the company's pipes continued most abundant to the last, and was exceedingly effective even when engines were not obtainable. On the 7th the fire was got under on both sides of the river, and immediate steps were taken to disinter the bodies of those who were known to be killed by the calamity. Amongst those the bodies of Mr. Pattinson, Mr. Hamilton, hairdresser, Ensign Paynter, Corporal Stephenson, Mr. Willis, a skinner, Mr. Duke, a bricklayer, and his son, a child named Conway, and McKenny, a labourer, were rescued. On the 8th the body of Mr. Mosley, a smith, was found much disfigured ; and about noon a charred and crumbling mass was discovered, without the least resemblance to humanity. A piece of the coat and a bunch of keys, lying close by, led to its identification as that of the son of John Dobson, esq. The next frag ments found were those of Mr. Thomas Sharp, a gentleman, shockingly mangled, but were identified by his gold watch and two dog whistles. Several other bodies were discovered in a similar condition. Mr. Davidson was identified by a signet ring, Mr. Harrison by a cigar case, one of the fireman by the nozzle of the engine pipe, and many others by similar articles known to have belonged to them. Tn Church-walk were found the family of a man, named Hart, consisting of himself, his wife, his son, and his niece. No portion of Mr. Bertram's body could be found, but a key, which he was known to have, and his snuff box were dis covered among the ruins. Inquests were soon after opened on the bodies, and a great amount of evidence was tendered as to the cause of the explosion, the general opinion being, that nothing but"], [301, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 295 a vast store of gunpowder could have been the cause of the catas trophe. Mr. Hugh Lee Pattinson offered an explanation of the disaster, which he attributed to water, whilst Professor Taylor suggested the probability of its origin to gas. Mr. Pattinson be lieved that the heat of the building had inflamed the sulphur, and, gradually, the whole mass of nitrate of soda and sulphur in the lower vaults had melted together, producing intense combustion and a heat such as could not well be conceived, and his assumption was, that whilst in that state, a body of water had found its way to the burning mass, and, by the immense expansive power of steam at such a heat, had caused the explosion. In his opinion 328 gallons of water falling in this way, would have as powerful an effect as eight tons of gunpowder- Professor Taylor sup posed, that the sulphur having taken fire had inflamed the nitrate of soda, which he said, would set free half-a-million cubic feet of gas, and the inability of the gas to escape fast enough through the door of the vault, had, he believed, caused the explosion. Both chemists, from various analysis of the ruins, were equally confident that no gunpowder had been present. The juries, after very lengthened sittings, finally came to open verdicts, expressing, however their belief that the explo sion had not arisen from gunpowder. The loss by this terrible fire was never accurately ascertained, but it was pretty generally estimated at half a- million. In Newcastle, commencing at the east end of the property destroyed upon the Quayside, the follow ing is a list of the principal sufferers : \u2014 Mr. G. Wilson, eating house keeper ; Mr. C. M.

Dunn's beer shop; a number of tenemented houses and small shops in Hillgate ; Mr. Wilson's fellmongery ; Mr. Martin Dunn's timber yard. Church- walk was almost entirely demolished, and many other houses it is impossible to enumerate. The public sympathy for the numerous poor families, who were rendered destitute by this terrible catastrophe, was displayed in the most marked manner throughout the kingdom. Upwards of \u00a311,000 were subscribed for their relief. No less than eight hundred families applied for assistance from the funds, and, altogether \u00a34,640 were paid for the loss of furniture. In February, 1857, the committee stated that they had expended \u00a36,533, and reserved \u00a33,044 for widows and orphans, and the remainder of the funds was distributed as follows: \u2014 Newcastle Infirmary, \u00a31,190; Gateshead Dispensary, \u00a3314; Ragged Schools, \u00a3195; other charities, &c. \u00a350. 1854 (October 13/ \u2014 Her Majesty and the Royal Family passed through Newcastle, on their return from Scotland. The Queen alighted at the Central Station for luncheon, and her majesty spoke a few words to the Mayor of Gateshead, expressing her great sorrow at the late calamity in which she was much interested. The Mayor of Newcastle afterwards received a letter from Colonel Phipps, requesting that her majesty's name might be added to the subscrip tion for the sufferers for \u00a3100. October 22. \u2014 Much excitement was produced this morning among the residents at the river side, at Elswick, by the bodies of two young and decently attired females being found drowned opposite the rolling quay of Messrs. Parker and Co. Information was immediately given to the police, who ascertained that they were the daughters of Ezekiel Robinson, Duke-street, Scotswood-road, Newcastle. Their names were Ellen Robinson, aged 15, and Isabella Robinson, aged 13. On the 23rd an inquest was held by Mr. Stoker, and on the jury viewing the bodies a more distressing and touching spectacle had seldom being witnessed. They were"], [303, "A.D. 1854.

It appeared that from some slight family quarrel Ellen had left the house about mightnight, followed by her younger sister, and it was supposed that the elder girl, who was of a passionate temper, had plunged into the river, and that the youngest, in attempting to save her sister, perished with her. 1854 (November 9). \u2014 The annual election of the chief corporate officers for the boroughs of Northumberland and Durham took place with the following result : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Isaac Lowthian Bell, esq., mayor; E.

It appeared that the Mary Graham, the property of Mr. Thompson, ship builder, left the harbour coal laden on the previous day, but on crossing the bar, from the swell, the vessel struck the ground. After proceeding a short distance it was found she was leaky, and instead of making for the harbour anchored off the bar. Unfortunately, during the night, the wind blew a hurricane from the south-east, but the vessel rode out the storm gallantly until the morning, when she suddenly broke from her moorings, came ashore, and went to pieces in a few minutes. Of all the crew \u2014 24 in number \u2014 only one man was saved. A number of vessels were also wrecked near Hartle pool, and many lives were lost. November 25. \u2014 Died, at Leazes-terrace, Newcastle, suddenly, aged 60, Mr. John Gibson, gUss-stainer and painter, a member of the Town Council, and late sheriff of the town. From an early age Mr. Gibson ardently devoted himself to the study and promotion of the fine arts, of which he was an enthusiastic admirer, and was himself an artist of high and varied talent ; whilst his thorough knowledge of the style and works of the old masters, added to his fine taste and sound judgment, caused his opinions to be most highly appreciated, and constantly appealed to, by both connoisseurs and artists ; and of its correctness the extensive and valuable gallery he had collected affords the best evidence and confirmation. His works in glass adorn many churches throughout the kingdom. November 25. \u2014 Died, in the Shieldfield, Newcastle, aged 81, Mr. Richard Thompson. The deceased left in his will \u00a31,000 of his estate in trust to the Corporation of Newcastle, to be disposed of as follows : \u2014 That loans of \u00a350 shall be granted for three year3 at 4 per cent, interest \" to inhabitants of the borough of Newcastle who may be desirous of commencing business therein.\" If there be not a sufficient number of such applicants to absorb the trust monies, then the surplus may be lent to persons who are already VOL III.

Mr. Joshua Wilson and Mr. Thomas Thompson proposed and seconded Mr. Seymour, and Aid. Allison and Mr. J. T. Alcoek nominated Henry Fenwick, esq. At the close of the poll Mr. Fenwick was 956, and Mr. Seymour 946. January 1.\u2014 The discovery of ironstone in Cleveland has given a great impetus to the manufacture of iron in the neighbourhood. A company was formed at Darlington, under the name of \" South Durham Iron Company,\" some time ago, who purchased of R. H. Allan, esq., about fifty acres of land (at a cost of \u00a310,000) adjacent to the town, upon part of which two blast furnaces have been erected, as well as a forge, and large waggon building shops. One of the furnaces was successfully \" tapped,\" and afterwards a large party sat down to an elegant entertainment at the King's Head Inn. Henry Pease, esq., presided, and several interesting addresses were delivered. January 18. \u2014 The new wing of the Newcastle Infirmary was inaugurated by the Duke of Northumberland and a brilliant party. This was the third extension of the building of this noble charity, it being upwards of a century since the original part of the Infirmary was built\u2014 namely, in the year 1750, and the first wing was added in 1800. The new wing, which contains 147 beds, is fitted up with every modern improvement, and the total cost of the various alterations and additions to the institution was upwards of \u00a310,000. His grace expressed himself much pleased with the"], [305, "A.D. 1855.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 299 arrangements, and made a second donation of \u00a3500. The sub- scriptions amounted to \u00a37,500. The Hon. H. T. Liddell, Sir John Fife, Mr. M. Bell, Mr. Commissioner Ellison, and other gentlemen afterwards addressed the assemblage. 1855 (January 22/ \u2014 Vice-Admiral Bowles, Captain R. Fitzroy, R.N., Lieutenant-General Sir John Bell, K.C.B.. R. B. Armstrong, Q.C., Recorder of Manchester, J. K. Brunei, C.E., the Royal Com- missioners appointed to enquire into the state of the river Tyne, arrived in Newcastle and proceeded to the Central Station Hotel. On the 24th, Mr. Webster, Q.C., who had been retained by five of the River Commissioners at Shields (the promoters of the inquiry), entered into a series of charges against the proceedings of the Tyne Commissioners generally, and produced the evidence of Mr, Popplewell, Mr. Lamb, Mr. Straker, and others in support of his case. Mr. Brooks, the engineer of the river, Mr. T. J. Taylor, Mr. Ure, the engineer of the Clyde, Mr. John Clayton, and a number of River Commissioners were heard on the other side, and on the 31st, the Recorder of Newcastle summed up the case ofthe majority of the local board. Further evidence was afterwards taken in London, and the proceedings finally closed on the 10th of March. In their report, dated the 19th May, the Commissioners approved ol the general policy of the Tyne Conservators dissenting from all the views ofthe promoters of the inquiry, and expressed a hope \" that those local jealousies and animosities which had hitherto prevailed at the board would be for ever buried in oblivion.\" January 28. \u2014 A splendid silver tea and coffee service and a centre piece with five branches were presented to J. Gibson, esq., land agent to the Marchioness of Londonderry, bearing the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to J. Gibson, esq., by the tenantry of the Most Honourable the Marchioness of Lon- donderry, and other friends, as an expression of their esteem for his personal character and their high appreciation of the many agricultural improvements introduced by him during the manage- ment of her ladyship's estates in the county of Durham.\" The plate was supplied from the establishment of Mr. John Mitchell, jeweller, High-street, Bishopwearmouth. February 10. \u2014 The remains of Lord Frederic Fitzclarence, who died in India, on the 30th of October, whilst acting as Com- mander-in-Chief of the forces in Bombay, were interred at Ford, Northumberland. The body was followed to the grave by deceased's widow and only daughter, who had accompanied it from India, the Earl of Glasgow, Viscount Falkland, Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, the tenantry of the Etal estates, and a great number of the residents in the neighbourhood, by all classes of whom his lordship was highly respected. The deceased was the third son of William IV., by Mrs. Jordon. February 28. \u2014 About two o'clock this morning a fire broke out in the extensive corn mill in Galllowgate, Newcastle, <fknown commonly as \" Anderson's Mill,\" but which, a few weeks before, had come into the occupancy of Mr. Hume. There was a"], [306, "300 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1855. deficiency of water until an hour after the origin of the fire, as, from the quantity of snow upon the ground, the mains could not be discovered, but the supply became afterwards so abundant that, through the strenuous exertions of parties, the progress of the, flames was most effectually checked. x\\.t seven o'clock the fire was entirely subdued, but the premises were left in a complete wreck, the whole of the stock being destroyed, machinery injured, and nothing but the bare walls left standing. 1855 (February 28/ \u2014 As Mr. John Lockey, of Hauxley, was on Amble Links, he shot a crow while flying, which had a young hare in its bill. Although the crow was shot quite dead, yet the hare was uninjured, and was brought up by Mr. Lockey as a pet. The extreme severity of the weather was supposed to be the cause of the crow seizing such a large animal. February 28. \u2014 At the Northumberland Assizes, before Baron Parke, the case of Thomas Stote Manby v. Thomas Wood Craster and Calverly Bewick, esqrs., came on for trial. Mr. Warren, Q.C., stated the case of the plaintiff, and, owing to the circum stances presenting many features in resemblance to those in the learned counsel's celebrated novel of \"Ten Thousand a Year,'' much interest was excited in court. The plantiff was a man in humble life, and the action was virtually to recover extensive estates in the parish of Long Benton and Wallsend, Northum berland, belonging to the defendants, on the ground that such estates had been obtained, in 1757, by Sir Robert Bewicke and Mr. John Craster, without a shadow of a right, on the death of the plaintiff's ancestor, Mrs. Dorothy Windsor. Mr. Warren entered into the case with great eloquence and ability, but he was stopped by the judge, who stated that he considered the statute of limita tions barred all title on the part of the plaintiff. The following paragraph appeared in the \" Newcastle Courant,\" August 18th, 1781: \u2014 \"The great cause between Mr. Stote Manby, Calverly Bewicke, and Daniel Craster, esqrs , was finally ended this day by a compromise, Mr. Stote Manby accepting \u00a31,500 for costs and au annuity of \u00a3300 in perpetuity.\" The following letter was ad dressed to the Editors ofthe \"Newcastle Courant\" : \u2014 \" Gentlemen, \" In the case of Manby versus Craster, I observe that the opening of the plaintiff's counsel tended to show that the compromise in 1781, was the act of the attorney then employed for the claimant. I happen to be a son of that attorney, and, being in my 83rd year, and a retired solicitor, it may not be irrelevant to state my know ledge of the circumstances, viz., that the compromise was the work of the counsel in the cause, and was effected behind the back of the attorney, alter the verdict in the town of Newcastle and before the cause had come on for the county of Northumberland. My father protested against it on all occasions, and to his dying day. He had several years litigation against the above powerful defend ants at his sole expense, his outlay for an individual being very"], [307, "A.D. 1855.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 301 large. The success of the claim would have been a great victory for my father, but counsel on his remonstrance asserted their right to act for the client. The \u00a31,500 were for costs, not as the judge put it, as a bribe. It was not a large sum for such an expensive suit, for there were other trials prior to 1781. The whole matter is fresh in my memory as to the disappointment which my father sustained, and it is rather hard that his name should now be sub ject to an unjust imputation. It is absurd to lay the blame on the attorney, for, how could he settle without his counsel's consent ? (Signed) William Harvet. \" Thirsk, March 5, 1855.\" The case was afterwards carried into the Court of Chancery, on the ground that the defendants had obtained possession of the estates by fraudulent means, but, after a protracted hearing, Vice- Chancellor Sir W. P. Wood, on the 23rd of April, 1857, decided that nothing had been elicited to support the allegations of the plaintiff, and his \" bill\" was dismissed, with costs. 1855 (March 7). \u2014 Died, at Ravensworth Castle, aged SO, the Right Honourable Thomas Henry Liddell, Baron Ravensworth. The deceased nobleman was the eldest son of Sir George Henry Liddell, bart., by the daughter of Thomas Steele, esq., of Hampsnet, Sussex. He was born in 1775, and married in 1796 the daughter of John Simpson, esq., of Bradley, Durham, who died in 1845, leaving a numerous issue of whom the Honourable Henry Thomas Liddell was the eldest son and succeeded to the title and estates. It appears from authentic records that the first baronet was an active supporter of Charles I, and was raised to that dignity for his defence of Newcastle in 1642. The fourth baronet was created a peer, but, dying without male issue, the title became extinct, but was revived in his grandson the late Lord Ravensworth. The deceased was a Tory in politics, and of the Pitt school, and in his day, though he took no prominent part in public affairs, yet he moved in the highest and most distinguished circles, and was honourably noticed at court by the successive sovereigns who reigned during his life. In private he was firm in his attachments, while his suavity of manners, upright deport ment, and amiable disposition, endeavoured him to all who had the honour of his acquaintance. His attention to the claims of the poor was constant, his charities were unostentatious and large, and his memory will long be revered by numerous parties who were the recipients of his bounty. The funeral took place at Lamesley, on the 16th, in a very private manner, and was attended by all his children then in England, by his sons-in-law the Earl of* Hardwicke, Viscount Barrington, and Sir Hedworth Williamson ; and by Earl Vane, the Earl of Mulgrave.

March 30. \u2014 Sunderland was this night visited by one of the most destructive fires which has occurred for many years. The building was stored with tar, hemp, and other inflammable materials, which caused the flames to rage with great fury. Four houses in Numbers' -garth and Garden-street were also set on fire, and, so rapid was the progress of devastation, that it was deemed advisable to send a telegraphic message to Newcastle for assistance, but the conflagration had been checked before the arrival of the engines, principally by the pulling down of a house in Garden-street. The damage was estimated at \u00a315,000. April 23. \u2014 Died, at North Shields, aged 78, Mr. William Richmond, ship owner. The deceased was born at Stockton, and commenced life as a cabin boy, but gradually succeeded in accumulating a small competence and in acquiring no inconsiderable store of learning. In literature, his compositions, generally of a controversial nature, were animated and nervous, and his speeches were as pungent as his writings, believing in no engineer except nature ; he viewed conservancy boards, piers, docks, and jetties, and all other \" improvements\" connected with the Tyne, with an inconceivable bitterness and hatred, and, although a member of the New Corporation of Tynemouth, he detested the institution with an intensity as ludicrous as it was at times vexa tious. He was, however, generally esteemed, and his death was very widely regretted in the neighbourhood. May 3. \u2014 Married, at St, Leonards, Thomas William Riddell, esq., eldest son of Thomas Riddell, esq., of Felton Park, North umberland, to Lady Henrietta Plunkett, daughter of the Earl of Fingall. May 7. \u2014 A most melancholy occurrence took place at Bywell this afternoon, which occasioned the death of the Rev. H. P. Dwarris. It appeared that Mr. Dwarris and his brother had taken a small skiff, their own property, in order to cross the river at a short distance above tbe Fishing Lock, where the water is very deep. They succeeded on reaching the opposite shore, but, on attempting to land, the skiff was upset, and both gentlemen were thrown into the water, the elder brother got upon the bank, but the other was drowned. The unfortunate gentleman was 33 years of age. May 14. \u2014 Workmen commenced the removal of the old property at the Head of the Side and Castle Garth, Newcastle, for the purpose of forming an improved approach to the High Level Bridge. Ihe \" Black Gate\" of the Castle was preserved from demolition by order of the Council.

June 27. \u2014 Died, at Great Burdon, near Darlington, Jane, wife of Mr. Joseph Snaith Wooler, a gentleman of independent means, and who had been educated for the medical profession. Soon after her death, suspicion was excited that Mrs. Wooler had been poisoned, and a coroner's inquest was subsequently held, at which immense excitement was occasioned by a statement of Dr. Hazlewood and Mr. Jackson, tbe deceased's physician and surgeon, that they had long been under the belief that Mrs. Wooler was suffering from repeated small doses of arsenic. The jury returned an open verdict, but Mr. Wooler was apprehended on the charge"], [310, "304 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1855. of murder, and, after lengthened examinations before the magis trates, was committed for trial. December 7th, Wooler was tried at Durham, before Baron Martin, Mr. James leading the prosecu tion, and Mr. Serjeant Wilkins the defence. The trial closed on Monday, the 10th, the evidence clearly establishing the fact that the deceased had died from the effects of arsenic, but being unsatisfactory as to the means by which the poison had been administered, the jury acquitted the prisoner. The trial excited great interest throughout the kingdom, and cost the county of Durham, \u00a3525. 1855 (July 1). \u2014 Died, at Blaydon, aged 105, Mrs. Ann Allison. July 3. \u2014 The Bradley Hall Estate, situate near Wolsingham, in the county of* Durham, containing upwards 1,000 acres, was bought by John Straker, esq,, of Tynemouth, for \u00a319,000. For many generations the Bradley Hall Estate belonged to the lordly family of Eure, of Witton Castle. From the Eures the estate passed to the great northern family of Tempest, and having become forfeited to the crown, in 1569, hy the rebellion of Robeit Tempest and Michael, his son, who had joined in the insurrection of the Earls of Westmorland and Northumberland, it was granted in fee by Queen Elizabeth, in the way of recompense, to Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam, for his services in putting down that rebellion, and had been in the possession of the Bowes family ever since. July 21. \u2014 The shop of Mr. David McDowell, chemist and druggist, Bell-street, North Shields, was discovered to be on fire this morning, just after the owner had left it in a private manner. The flames were soon extinguished, and, as from the appearance of the premises it seemed almost certain that the fire had not been accidental, Mr. McDowell was apprehended, charged with com mitting the act. He was tried at the ensuing assizes, before Mr. Justice Crowder, was convicted of the offence, and sentenced to fifteen years' transportation. July 25. \u2014 Died, at Whitfield Hall, Northumberland, aged 75, William Ord, esq. The family of Ord, of which the deceased was the last male descendant, had been connected for upwards of three centuries with Newcastle. Mr. Ord having been in Parlia ment as the representative first of Morpeth and then of Newcastle for fifty years, he had been associated, as a public man, with the most important legislative changes which this country has under gone in modern times. Through life he was the uniform supporter of Whig principles and measures, and, without being a frequent speaker in Parliament, he was nearly always present, and voted on all divisions of consequence. The Abolition of Slavery, Repeal ofthe Corporations and Tests Act, Catholic Emancipation, Partial Abolition of Capital Punishment, Parliamentary Reform, Municipal Corporation Reform, Abolition of the Corn Laws, &c, with many other measures of a similar character and tendency, were all sup ported by Mr. Ord. He lived on terms of the utmost intimacy and friendship with the great leaders of the Liberal party, by"], [311, "A.D. 1855.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 305 whom he was highly respected, as he was, indeed, by all who knew him, for his strictly upright and honourable conduct, both in private and parliamentary life. On Mr. Ord's retirement from the representation of Newcastle, and from Parliament, at the general election of 1852, his services were acknowledged by a public dinner, which was given to him, at which the mayor presided. Besides many of the principal inhabitants, there were present several members of Parliament, Earl Grey, the Earl of Carlisle, the Earl of Durham, Sir Walter Trevelyan., bart., &c, &c, when the speeches delivered showed the high estimation in which they held the venerable individual who was retiring from a long and useful public life. Mr. Ord was the eldest son of William Ord, esq., of Fenham, Newminster Abbey, and Whitfield, by Eleanor, daughter of Charles Brandling, esq. He was born January 2nd, 1781. In 1802 he was elected M.P. for Morpeth, and sat for that borough until the passing of the Reform Bill. Tn 1835 Mr. Ord was elected M.P. for Newcastle, and continued one of its representatives until his retirement from public life in 1852. Mr. Ord had an only son born 1803, Mr. W. H. Ord, who was several years M.P. for Newport, Isle of Wight, and one of the Lords of the Treasury. He died in 1839 leaving no issue. The family property descended to the Rev. J. A.

H. Allan, esq., was considerably damaged by the lightning. About half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the electric fluid struck the chimney at the west end of the building, and passed through three rooms and the pantry. Some idea may be formed of the violence of the shock from the shattered state of the rooms, the windows all broken, panels of the doors driven out, and the chairs, &c, upset. A servant who was in the pantry was thrown to the ground, but happily uninjured, and soon recovered. A number of bottles and other articles were displaced and broken. The family, most fortunately, were at the time at the other end of the house and received no injury. August UO. \u2014 The foundation-stone of the New Town Hall, now erected in St. Nicholas-square, Newcastle, was laid with great ceremony by the mayor (Mr. Bell), in the presence of the members of the Corporation of the town, the chief magistrates of Gateshead and South Shields, and above ten thousand of the principal inhabitants of Newcastle and its environs. An imposing pro cession was formed at the Guildhall, which walked to the site of the proposed buildings, where Dr. Headlam commenced the proceedings by a brief address to the mayor on the objects and advantages of the proposed erection, and concluded by presenting his worship with a silver trowel, to be used in laying the stone. A brass plate, bearing an inscription commemorative of the pro ceedings, a scroll with the names of the building committee, a VOL. III.

The Mayor, Mr. Headlam, M P., the Hon. H. G. Liddell, M.P., and Mr. Ingham, M.P., briefly addressed the assemblage in con gratulatory terms on the auspicious commencement of the works. In the evening the Mayor gave a grand entertainment in the Assembly Rooms, Lord Ravensworth, the Mayors of Gateshead, Sunderland, Tynemouth, and South Shields, the Rev. E. C.

Johnstone, esq , F.R.S., lecturer on chemistry and mineralogy in Durham University. The deceased had long been celebrated for his literary and scientific attainments, and his works on agricultural chemistry are highly esteemed. His last production \" The Chemistry of Comm'on Life\" had been finished but a short time before his death, and its pleasing style caused it to be exceedingly popular. September 27. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, aged 68, John Adamson, esq. Mr. Adamson was a gentleman of distinguished literary"], [313, "A.D. 1855.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 307 attainments, and an author of considerable taste and learning. His \" Life of Camoens, the poet,\" is the best extant, and evinces much research, and an extensive acquaintance with the Portuguese language (see page 244 of this volume) and the best writers of that country, hoth ancient and modern. His antiquarian attainments are well known, as he filled the office of Secretary to the Antiquarian Society for many years. Besides practising in his profession as a solicitor, he was for twenty-two years Secretary of the Carlisle Railway Company. Mr. Adamson was highly respected in the district, and his sudden death was widely regretted. October 6.\u2014 The friends of Alderman David Haggie having had his portrait taken, presented it to the Corporation of Gateshead, to give enduring impression to the grateful sense entertained by the public of his conduct as chief-magistrate during the great calamity of which this was the first anniversary. In addition to the portrait an elegant silver epergne was presented to Mrs. Haggie, bearing a suitable inscription. The picture (ten feet high) was from the easel of Mr. Shotton, of North Shields, on whom the execution of the painting reflects the greatest credit. The epergne (supplied from the establishment of Messrs. Reid and Sons) stands on a plate glass mirror, let into a plateau of silver ; and on the three sides of the base, respectively, are engraved the arms of Mr. Haggie and motto (Semper Paratus), the arms of the Corporation and motto (Caput Inter Nubila Condit), and the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to Mr3.

Losh, Wilson, and Bell, by which five men and two boys were killed, and several others injured. The body of the boiler, at the time it burst, unfurled like a sail, was blown upwards, carrying with it two roofings of the sheds, and blowing down two furnaces, with their chimneys, and scattering the molten metal and red hot bricks around, while one end of it was hurled into the midst of the works, and the other about 200 yards over the hill top, into the lumber yard. The following is a list of the sufferers, : \u2014 John James, Patrick Donnoley, Joshua Jenkins, Abraham Dixon, Martin Broderick, Thomas Griffith, and John Porter. October 17. \u2014 The Queen and Royal Family passed through Northumberland and Durham, on their return to the south. The royal train stopped a few minutes at Newcastle, and was received by a great number of the inhabitants with the most enthusiastic loyalty. At Darlington, the High Sheriff (F. Mewburn, esq.) and H. Pease, esq., were introduced to her majesty by Sir George Grey, and presented an address to Prince Albert from the com mittee of the Polytechnic Exhibition, to which his royal highness"], [314, "308 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D 1855. had sent the model of her majesty's yacht, the Fairy. The royal party then proceeded on their journey. 1 855 (October 2 1 /\u2014The inhabitants of the quiet and retired village of Matfen, adjoining the beautiful seat of Sir Edward Blackett, bart., were thrown into considerable excitement aud alarm by the discovery of a horrible murder having been perpetrated in a cottage a short distance off, and which, for atrocity and cold heartedness, had at least no parallel in the county of Northumber land since the brutal murder of \" Joe the Quilter,\" at Homer 's-lane, in the parish of Warden. An old female, aged 66, named Dorothy Bewicke, resided in one of a row of five cottages, at a place called Waterloo. The scene of this diabolical tragedy presented one of the most melancholy and miserable features of human wretchedness on record. The entire range of cottages were in a most dilapidated condition, and in that occupied by Dorothy light, air, and rain had free access in several places, while the fowls of the field roosted nightly under the roof. Not a window contained a whole set of panes, and many an old clout and other pliable article formed a substitute for glass, besides keeping the air out. The old woman had gained the reputation of being wealthy \u2014 the row of cottages being her property \u2014 and it was, no doubt, the expectation of finding money which led to her fate. On the neighbours entering her house this morning they found the body of the murdered woman lying upon the floor of her bedroom, upstairs. Her hands were pinioned across her breast with a leather strap, and her legs were tied together with a halter. She had evidently been strangled, the marks of fingers upon her throat being very distinct. Every portion of the bedroom and its contents had been ransacked, and even the bed-tick of the deceased had been cut open, in search of money, the murderers having obscured the front windows with sacks and other articles in order to elude the observation of travellers during their search. The announce ment of the murder created the deepest horror throughout the county ; and suspicion having settled upon a party of besom makers, occupying one of the cottages, James Conroy, Michael Allan, John Simm, Isabella Allan (mother of Michael Allan), and Jane and Ellen Allan (his sisters), were apprehended by the police, and committed for trial on the charge of wilful murder. February 29th, 1856, they were brought up at the Northumberland Assizes, before Mr. Justice Willes, when Simm was admitted a witness for the Crown, without, however, adding materially to the strongly suspicious facts adduced by others. After two days trial the prisoners were acquitted. October 23. \u2014 The full length portrait, painted by Grant, RA., of Ralph Ward Jackson, esq., as the \" Founder of West Hartlepool,\" was presented to the West Hartlepool Improvement Commissioners, in trust for the town, by public subscription, and placed in the Athen\u00e6um, as a tribute of esteem for his character and genius. The afternoon was observed as a holiday in the town, and a dinner took place in the evening, to which 170 gentlemen sat down."], [315, "A.D. 1854.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 309 1 855 (October 29) . \u2014 It was discovered that Mr. Robert Martinson) junior cashier of the Northumberland and Durham District Bank, Newcastle, had suddenly absconded with the sum of \u00a34,264, the property of his employers. The delinquent was captured by Detective James Cosser, of the Newcastle force, on the 17th of November, at Southampton, when about to sail for America, and \u00a32,473 of the money was recovered. He was tried for the offence, before Baron Martin, on the 4th of December, and transported for fourteen years. November 1. \u2014 A horrible murder was perpetrated this day, about a mile and a half from the village of Bumopfield, in the county of Durham. Coming so immediately after the commission of a similar crime at Matfen it naturally created much excitement in the neighbourhood. The victim was a young man, named Robert Stirling, 26 years of age, and an assistant with Mr. Watson, a surgeon in extensive practice at Bumopfield. Mr. Stirling left his employer's house in the forenoon, to visit some patients at Thornley and the Spen, and was last seen alive about ten o'clock when he was returning home. From that time all traces of him were lost, and, although search was made in every direction, he was not found until the 6th, when his body was discovered by his father (who had come from Kirkintolloch, in Scotland) in Smaile's Wood, a plantation in the immediate vicinity of Bumopfield. It was evident that he had been shot whilst walking along the lane, and his body had afterwards been dragged through the hedge, into the wood, where his throat had been cut and his head terribly shattered, apparently with the butt end of a gun. His watch, a ring which he wore, and his purse containing a sum of money, had been removed, and his body concealed in the brushwood. As the deceased had only been in the neighbourhood for ten days it was surmised that he had not been the victim originally marked by his murderers, and the day of his death having been that fixed for John Bowes. esq.'s rent day, it was supposed he had been mistaken for one of the tenants on his way to pay his rent. March 6, 1856, John Cain -and Richard Rayne were arraigned at Durham Assizes, before Baron Martin, for the crime, but the evidence not being complete they were remanded to the Summer Assizes. On the 25th and 26th July, accordingly, the prisoners were tried before Mr. Justice Willes, Mr. Overend conducting the prosecution, and Mr. Monk and Mr. Davison being employed for the defence. After a protracted trial, in which a variety of con flicting circumstantial evidence was adduced on behalf of the pro secution, a verdict of not guilty was returned. November 8. \u2014 The Rev. Clement Moody, Vicar of New castle, was presented with an elegant silver candelabrum, value 150 guineas, and a purse containing \u00a3380, by a number of the inhabitants. The plate bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" To the Reverend Clement Moody, Vicar of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, together with a purse of 380 sovereigns, in testimony of the admiration and esteem of the subscribers, for his very energetic and efficient"], [316, "[a.d. 1856. 310 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF services during the short period he has held the office of vicar.

Ellison was on duty near the Central Station, Newcastle, he was alarmed by a female voice shouting \" Murder.\" Finding the sounds of the voice issuing from the back premises of the Railway Arcade public house, Neville-street, kept by a Mr. Beardsmore, he instantly knocked at the door, which was opened by Mr. Beardsmore, and, proceeding along the passage, he found Mrs. Beardsmore laying on the pavement, apparently lifeless, and bleeding profusely from severe wounds on the head. She was put to bed, when she partially rallied, and charged her husband with having thrust her out of one of the upstairs windows. She died a few day after of the injuries she had received. Both husband and wife were of very dissipated habits, and it afterwards transpired that they had had a serious quarrel during the night, at the termi nation of which a crash was heard of the woman falling into the passage. Beardsmore was tried at the ensuing Spring Assizes, before Baron Martin, when he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for an assault. 1856 (January 16/ \u2014 A public dinner wrs held at the Bridge of Ain Inn, Whittingham, in honour of Captain J. R. Carr, son of Ralph Carr, esq., of Hedgley Northumberland, to con gratulate the gallant captain on his safe return from the Crimea, and also to present him with a sword, as a token of their respect and esteem, for which 150 guineas had been subscribed by his friends and neighbours. Captain Carr landed in the Crimea with the first expedition, and was present at the different engagements with his regiment. January 16. \u2014 Mr. Joseph Hodgson, carver, Sunderland, received the silver medal of the Royal National Lifeboat Institu tion, in testimony of his extraordinary exertions in saving life, extending over a period of twelve years. He had personally rescued ten persons from drowning, and assisted, in life and other boats, in saving seventeen others. He had always declined any pecuniary consideration for his services, but was very solicitous to possess the medal of the old and valuable institution, which was voted to him with applause."], [317, "A.D. 1856.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 311 1856 (February 5). \u2014 The election of a member of Parhament for Newcastle, in the room of J.

Bell proposed and seconded George Ridley, esq., and Mr. Watson and Mr. Thomas nominated Mr. Richard Hart, a Chartist. The latter, however, retired, and Mr. Ridley was declared duly elected. February 5. \u2014 A handsome service of plate, upwards of a hundred guineas in value, consisting of tea and coffee pots, cream ewer, sugar basin, toast rack, and three dozen spoons and forks, accompanied by a purse of gold, was presented to John Walker Mayson, esq., ex-mayor of Tynemouth, by the inhabitants of that borough, as a memorial of respect for his character, and of admira tion for the industry, independent and distinguished abilities with which he discharged his official duties while chief magistrate. The presentation was made at the Albion Hotel by Dr. Dodd, the Mayor (Capt. Linskill) presiding. February 7. \u2014 A violent gale of wind occurred this morning, and did great injury to property, particularly amongst shipping. At North and South Shields a number of vessels were blown from their moorings and dashed together, the damage being estimated at more than \u00a315,000. In Newcastle a number of chimneys were blown down, and some narrow escapes occurred. One of the stone vases on the highest turret of All Saints' Church was torn off, and did considerable damage in its fall ; and a chimney, 70 feet high, belonging to the brewery of Mr. Wilkinson, Westgate, was also overthrown, by which the neighbouring property suffered to a great extent. At North Shields the Wesleyan School-room was unroofed ; and two houses at Elder's-quay and Milburn-place were blown down. At South Shields several waggons, filled with coals, standing upon the Stanhope Coal-drops, were hurled over into a vessel, the ship receiving so much damage that she sank immediately. At Tynemouth three houses were wholly unroofed, and at Monkton a windmill was entirely destroyed. In the country a great number of stacks were blown down and trees uprooted. At Alnwick Mr. Robertson, auctioneer, and his family had a narrow escape, the chimney of his house having been thrown upon the roof, and the whole mass falling on and around his bed. Scarcely a house in Alnwick escaped damage from the gale which raged there with almost unequalled fury. February 9. \u2014 Major Brandling, son of the late R. W. Brandling, esq., of Low Gosforth, and who had greatly distin guished himself in the Crimea, was presented with a valuable sword by the inhabitants of Newcastle. The presentatkn was made in the Guildhall by Captain Woods, and a splendid banquet was given to the gallant major, by about one hundred gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood, in the Queen's Head Inn, at which the Mayor presided.

Shortly after 1626 the Bradley property came into the possession of Sir Francis Anderson, knight, of Jesmond, a devoted Loyalist ; and on the ruin of the royal cause he became an object of peculiar persecution to the successful party. He was fined \u00a31,200, sequestered, imprisoned, and stripped of his title of knighthood, which fell within the list of proscribed honours conferred after the 4th of January, 1641, when Charles separated himself from his Parlia ment. He was sheriff of Newcastle in 1641, mayor in 1662 and 1675, and M.P. for the town in 1660-61 and 1678-9, in which last year he died. His son and successor, Henry Anderson, esq., married Dorcas Matfen in 1681. Their daughter, Jane, married John Simpson, of Newcastle, and in her right of Bradley. John Simpson, their second son, married Anne, daughter of Richard Clutterbuck, esq., of Warkworth.

The chair was taken by Earl Vane, the Marchioness of Londonderry being seated on his right, and the Countess Vane on his left. On the platform were Mr. Mowbray, M.P., Mr. Hugh Taylor, chairman of the coal trade, Mr. Commissioner Ellison, Mr. Baker Baker, the Mayors of Durham and Sunderland, Mr. G. Elliott, &c. After dinner the meeting was addressed by the Marchioness in an eloquent and im pressive manner, which was replied to by Mr. James Cuthbertson, one of the workmen, and the proceedings passed off most agreeably to all present. March 6. \u2014 Married, in London, Wentworth Blackett Beau mont, esq , M.P., of Bywell, Northumberland, to the Lady Margaret Anne De Burgh, fourth daughter of the Marquis of Clanricarde. By daybreak several guns at Hexham, Bywell, Allendale, and other places on the vast estates of the hon. gentle man in Northumberland and Durham, ushered in the festivities of the day, and these were followed by the display of banners, the ringing of bells, and the parading of bands playing festive music. At Hexham \u00a3100, in Weardale \u00a3200, and smaller amounts in other places, were distributed amongst the poor, and a grand ball and supper to the principal inhabitants of Newcastle and Hexham and the neighbouring district stook place at Bywell Hall.

The fire burnt with such rapidity that Mr. Russell and his family had the utmost difficulty in escaping from the rooms above, and scarcely any portion of the stock in the premises could be saved. A man named John Mills, whilst endeavouring to remove some articles from Mr. Russell's shop was burnt to death. Mr. Russell's loss was very heavy, and great public sympathy was manifested towards him, a considerable sum being raised by subscription for his benefit. 1856 (March 12).\u2014 Died, at Belsay, in his 100th year, Mr. Anthony Scott.

The deceased gained high honours at the University of Oxford, and his rare excellence as a public speaker, unremitting attention to business, and pleasing manners, made him a general favourite with all classes, and caused his premature death to be very widely regretted. April 30. \u2014 Died, in the Workhouse, Newcastle, aged 85, Mr. Samuel Wall Nicholson, some years lessee of the Theatre Royal in that town. May 2. \u2014 Peace with Russia was proclaimed this day in Newcastle, by the Mayor, accompanied by the Magistrates and Corporation, surrounded by military pomp, aud in presence of several hundreds of the inhabitants After the proclamation had been read on the Sandhill, the procession moved up the Side, Dean-street, Grey-street, &c, to the White Cross, Newgate-street, when it was again read, and the same formality was gone through a third time at St. Nicholas'-square, where the assemblage separated. The under-sheriffs of Northumberland and Durham read the proclamation in a similar manner in the principal towns of their bailiwicks. May 9. \u2014 A person of gentlemanly exterior, who had obtained lodgings at the Turk's Head Inn, Newcastle, this night robbed in a skilful and most audacious manner two travellers staying over night in the same house. Neither of the gentlemen robbed were disturbed. The doors of the two rooms entered were found locked inside, and no marks of violence were to be seen on them, nor had the locks been injured. The case resembled that reported a short time previous, in which two Americans had carried on a system of plunder at hotels in Manchester and elsewhere, and where it was shown that by means of certain instruments, which were there discovered, a gentleman's bedroom could be entered, even though locked with the key inside, and plundered without much disturb ance. One of the instruments was in the form of a pair of pliers, vol in.

A doorway and two windows, probably of about the fourteenth century, were laid bare, as well as the original oaken roof of a large apartment. The building had been one of very great extent, and had apparently undergone extensive alterations after the Reformation, as portions of windows in the Tudor style were distinguishable. No record of the original purposes of the building could be discovered, but it is very probable they were of a monastic character. About the same time and place, two very large antlers were found, about sixteen feet below the surface. May 13. \u2014 A grand bazaar of useful and ornamental work, was opened in the Music Hall and Assembly Rooms, Newcastle, by a number of ladies connected with the Wesleyan body, for the purpose of raising funds to erect and establish schools upon the site at present occupied by the Orphan House, in Northumberland street, which is remarkable as the first Wesleyan Chapel reared in this town, by, it is stated, Wesley himself, and which schools will be open to children of all denominations. Seldom has so richly furnished a bazaar been opened in this town, and the tact of the ladies in effecting sales was equal to the liberality and industry of the previous preparation.

Kirkup with a handsome silver coffee and tea service and other articles of silver plate, as a token of their high respect for his character.

Intelligence of the event having been widely circulated, special trains poured in many a thousand from Newcastle, Shields, Sunderland, Durham, Stockton, Darlington, Manchester, Leeds, &c. Flags and streamers, waved from every house, and in long lines across the streets, the ships in the harbour were gaily decorated, and an universal air of animation pervaded the locality. At three o'clock the new screw steamer Ward Jackson, with the directors and their friends, the screw steamer Zingari, the steamer Pilot, with the Corporation of the Trinity House, Newcastle, the screw steamers Emanuel and Luna, and four merchant vessels sailed majestically into the new dock, amidst the firing of cannon and every demonstration of rejoicing.

The prince arrived off the mouth the of Tyne, in his yacht the \" Reine Hortense,\" at an early hour, and, after landing with his suite at Tynemouth, and visiting the ruins of the Abbey, they repaired to the railway station, and from thence were conveyed to Newcastle. After breakfasting at the Queen's Head Inn, the distinguished visitors set off for Seghill Colliery, where the whole process of mining operations was explained to them by Mr. John Carr, jun., and Mr. Fryer, the viewer. His imperial highness wishing to become practically acquainted with the nature of a miner's work took up a pick which he wielded vigorously for some time, but after a good trial laid it down and looking mournfully at his blistered hands, remarked that he could not work like that for six shillings a day if he were starving.

The weather being exceedingly warm, the deceased and a few compa nions agreed to bathe, and went into the Tyne at the apot where the Rev. H. P. Dwarris was drowned. The deceased suddenly got out of his depths, when one of his companions seized him by the hair of the head, but not being able to retain his hold, Richardson sank and was drowned. He was the eldest son of Mr. Joseph Richardson, ot Matfen. of steady and industrious habits, and of an amiable disposition. His untimely end was greatly lamented. June 30. \u2014 Mr. Brough, the auctioneer, put up for sale the building sites to form the west side of the street of approach to the High Level Bridge, Newcastle, and also those on both sides of the Quayside-street, No. 1, to be called Headlam-street, and which is to extend from the Side to the Quay. The latter street is that portion of the Quay, which was devastated by the fire. The High Level sites, numbered from 1 to 7, comprising 1067, square yards of ground, were first put up in one lot, at a gross sum, and \u00a32,000 was offered, but the reserved bid was \u00a34,500. The sites were then offered, in separate lots. Tbe first consisted of 155 square yards, with the privilege of taking the two sites adjoining at the same price, and 50s. per square yard was offered, but the reserved bid was 70s. For site 4, with the two adjoining, 45s. were offered, but the reserve was 70s. Lot 7 was the site of the old Duke of Cumberland public house, and possessed a license. The area was 180 square yards, and 45s. per yard was offered, but the reserved bid was \u00a35. The Quayside sites were then put up, and for the sites No. 1 to 7, comprising 1141 square yards, the sum of \u00a34,200 was offered, but the reserved bid being \u00a310,000 there was no sale. July 2. \u2014 Died, at the Chesters, Northumberland, Nathaniel, eldest son of the late Nathaniel Clayton, esq., of that place and Newcastle. Mr. Clayton was at Harrow with Byron and Peel, and the noble poet speaking of his schoolfellows in his journal say's of him \" Clayton was another school monster of learning and talent and hope, but what has become of him I do not know. He was certainly a genius.\" July 6. \u2014 This evening, as a pleasure party consisting of fourteen persons, were returning to Newcastle in a small boat from Dunston, their frail bark was capsized, exactly opposite the Shot Tower, and the whole party were thrown into river. An old scullerman, named Cooper, who plies across the river at this place, pulled with desperate energy to the spot, and succeeded in saving"], [323, "A.D. 1856.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 317 seven of them, but the remaining seven were drowned, their names were Abraham Cohen, tide waiter ; Mary Ann Cohen, aged 16, his eldest daughter; Samuel Lemon, hawker; Robert Eltring ham, sawyer ; Isabella Deniston Eltringham, his daughter, aged 20 ; Henry Hanby, tide waiter ; Thomas Thomas Edward Rice Oakley, tide waiter. Mrs. Cohen and two children ; Mrs. Lemon and child ; Henry Humphrey and Henry Beaumont were saved. A subscription was raised to reward Cooper for his exertions in rescuing the survivors, and the Corporation presented him with an elegant silver medal. 1850 (July 6/ \u2014 An accident of a similar description occurred at sea, off Ryhope, near the mouth of tho Wear, to a pleasure boat containing eight young men belonging to Sunderland. Four of them, fortunately, clung to the mast of the boat and were saved, the others, whose names were Davison, Hutchinson, Ramsay, and Smurthwaite, were drowned. July 12. \u2014 An outrageous and deadly attack with gun, bludgeon, and scythe, was made by a numerous body of Ribbonmen, near the Felling, upon a small party of Orangemen, quietly marching in procession in celebration of the victory of the Boyne, in which William III., Prince of Orange, overcame the forces of James II. and secured the protestant succession in his own person to the English throne. A number of the Orangemen were much injured, and several of the Ribbonmen were afterwards apprehended and imprisoned for the offence. August 6. \u2014 Died, in London, aged 55, the Right Hon Isabella Horatio Lady Ravensworth. Her ladysdip was the eldest daughter of the late Lord George Seymour, and grand-daughter ot Francis, first Marquis of Hertford, and was married in 1820 to the Hon. H. T. Liddell, now Lord Ravensworth, by whom her lady ship had fourteen children, all of whom, except three, survived her. August 17. \u2014 Died, in London, aged 58, James Hann, esq., a well-known mathematician. The deceased was a native of Tyneside, his father being superintendent of the pumping engine at Hebburn Colliery, and James, at an early age, performed the duties of stoker. Many of the best years of his life were occupied in pursuits of so laborious a character as to leave him but trifling leisure for his favourite studies. When in his 21st year, Hann was engaged as fireman in the X L, a small passenger steamboat, plying between Newcastle and Shields, and it was whilst working in this manner, that he was first seen by Goldsworthy Gurney reading the works of Emmerson, the mathematician. The follow ing anecdote is illustrative of the difficulty he had in obtaining books treating of his favourite subjects : \u2014 '' One evening, in return ing homeward from his daily toil, he saw a soiled copy of \"Dr. Gregory's Mathematics for Practical Men\" exposed for sale on the Quayside. The price was a mere trifle, but Hann had not a penny in his pocket He turned away in despair, not knowing how to possess himself of the treasure. His wife was in the fields when he arrived at home, his little daughter performing the duties of"], [324, "318 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1856. housekeeper. He enquired of the child if her mother had paid the rent, and, on being answered in the negative, he asked where she had put it. The daughter directed him to a tea cup in the cup board. He took the money and set off at once, as it was near the hour his wife was expected home, and he, probably, feared some remonstrance. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hann returned, and the first news from her daughter was, that her father had taken the money. His wife immediately set out in pursuit, and overtook her husband before he arrived at the book shop. She remonstrated, as he Bad anticipated, but he quieted her by saying, that if he could get that book he would be able to make all tbeir fortunes. His wife at last, consented, and Hann often declared that the happiest moment of his life was when he became the owner of that work.\" He was at length persuaded to open a school at Friars' Goose, near New castle, this he did not continue long. Through the influence of his friend Mr. Woolhouse, Mr. Hann procured an appointment in the \" Nautical Almanack\" office, Greenwich. He afterwards became writing master in King's College, London, and, ultimately, mathematical master. His able works on mathematics and mechanical science will endear him to those of future times. He was not only esteemed in this country, but his works made him known and appreciated throughout Europe. Of kindly heart, generous impulses, and honourable conduct, whoever knew him esteemed and loved him. 1856 (August 24/ \u2014 A melancholy case of drowning occurred on Whitley Sands, near Tynemouth. It appeared that Mr. William Reid, a clerk in the establishment of Messrs. Reid and Sons, gold smiths, Newcastle, and a nephew of the head of the firm, while spending the day at Cullercoats with Mr. C. J. Reid, his cousin, had, along with that gentleman and one or two other parties, taken a walk along the sands in the afternoon. On arriving northward of Whitley-terrace, he undressed to bathe, and the rest ofthe party sat down on the bank side. Being able to swim a little, Mr. Reid, on getting into the water, struck out, but almost immediately appeared to lose his footing, either by getting beyond his depth or sinking into some hollow, occasioned by the influx of the waves in the out-going tide, and about ten minutes after going into the water, he was swept away and drowned. This melancholy event excited considerable sensation. August 30. \u2014 A handsome entertainment was given this evening, by the Loyal Hotspur Lodge of Oddfellows, at the Brown Jug Inn, Stepney-bank, accompanied with the presentation of his portrait, to Mr. Thomas Wilson, for many years the respected manager of Mr. Mather's extensive and eminent estab lishment in Dean-street, Newcastle, as a testimonial of their estimation of his services in connection with the Lodge, as well as of their respect for his private character. Upwards of sixty sat down to dinner, Mr. William Hopper in the chair ; and the portrait, an admirable one, by Mr. Stephen Humble, Newcastle, was presented by Mr. Cathrall, in a highly complimentary speech."], [325, "A.D. 1856. J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 319 He traced the services of Mr. Wilson to the Lodge since he entered it in 1841, and paid a tribute to his character alike as an able man of business and a most estimable citizen in private life. Mr. Wilson made an appropriate and seeling response. A variety of other complimentary toasts were given, including that of Mr. Humble, upon whose abilities as an artist and portrait painter a high eulogium was passed. 1856 (September 24). \u2014 Died, at South Park, near Tunbridge Wells, aged 71, Field Marshal the Right Hon Viscount Hardinge, G.C.B., &c, &c. This gallant soldier, who was born on the 30th of March, 1785, was the third son of the Rev. Henry Hardinge, rector of the valuable living of Stanhope. He was gazetted as an ensign as early as 1798, and steadily rose in rank. Few persons have held so many and such varied public employments, and on state occasions, when his breast was literally covered with the insignia of orders of knighthood, crosses, and medals, his appear ance never failed to attract the attention of every spectator. During the whole of the Peninsular War he acted as Deputy Quarter-Master-General of the Portuguese army. He was wounded at Vimiera, was present at Rolica and Corunna, at the passage of the Douro Busaco, Torres Vedras, the three sieges of Badajos, Cindad Rodrigo, Alluera, Salamanca, Vittoria (where he was wounded), Pampeluna, the crossing of the Pyrenees, Nivel. Nives, and others. In 1815 he was attached to the Prussian army, and lost a hand whilst under Blucher at Ligny. On the final establish ment of peace he offered his services to the Government, and was successively Secretary at War, Secretary for Ireland, and Master- General of the Ordnance. In 1820 he was elected a representative for the city of Durham, but resigned in July, 1830. In 1844 he was raised to the high dignity of Governor-General of India, immediately before the outbreak of the war in the Punjaub. He was on the field of battle from the beginning to the end of the contest, and greatly contributed, by the powerful aid he rendered to Lord Gough, to bring the war to a successful issue. The treaty of Lahore, which he concluded, exhibits him in the light of a magnanimous conqueror. On its ratification he was created Vis count Hardinge of Lahore. The East India Company granted him a pension of \u00a33,000 per annum, and the Parliament voted him \u00a35,000 and his two next successors. His final distinction, that of Field- Marshal, was conferred in 1855. His lordship married, in 1821, Emily, daughter of the first Marquis of Londonderry, and his connection with that noble family, as well as the possession of the estate at Ketton, frequently brought him as a visitor into the county of Durham. September 28. \u2014 Owing to continuous rains the rivers in North umberland and Durham were greatly flooded. The main damage, on both sides of the Tyne, was to the produce of the fields, in many of which the stooks were swept down, and the sheaves washed about ; and, in several cases, to such extent was it brought down the river, that at one time the Tyne, opposite"], [326, "[A.D. 1856. 320 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF Newcastle Quay, was covered with floating corn. Mrs. Hall, of Newburn Hall Farm, was one of the most extensive sufferers, who had, it was said, nearly forty acres of corn swept away. The Yarm, the Tees, and the Wear, were equally flooded, and a great deal of damage was done to field produce. The Coquet, the Wans beck, the Ain, and several rivers farther north in many places overflowed their banks, and in flat low lying lands, the country presented the appearance of innumerable lakes ; roads were washed up, bridges rendered impassable, water dykes thrown down, and whole farms covered with water, A ludicrous yet perilous incident occurred to a farm labourer, who had floated down the river Tees on a stack of corn. He had come from the neighbourhood of Yarm, and was taken to South Stockton before he could be removed This, no doubt, was one of the highest floods that has occurred within almost living memory. 1856 (October 7 ) \u2014 The most destructive fire known in Stockton for many years broke out this morning, in the premises of Mr. Samuel Braithwaite, grocer, which soon completed its work of destruction, consuming the whole of the extensive premises, and doing considerable damage to the houses in the neighbourhood. Mr. Braithwaite and his family, who lived in the premises, were with difficulty rescued in their night clothes, but it was found impracticable to save anything with the exception of a few articles of jewellery. A quantity of gunpowder, which was kept on the premises, exploded with great violence, and blew out the front of the house, as well as many windows in the neighbourhood ; and the alarming appearance of the flames at this juncture having induced the authorities to send to Hartlepool for additional fire engines, a messenger was obtained, who rode the distance (fourteen miles) in thirty-five minutes. Two engines were immediately despatched, and the conflagration was subdued in about four hours. The damage was estimated at about \u00a37,000. October 8. \u2014 Died, in Northumberland street, Newcastle, aged 54, the Rev. Richard Clayton, M.A., Master of the Hospital of the St. Mary Magdalene, and Chaplain of St. Thomas' of that town. The deceased, who was the youngest son of the late Nathaniel Clayton, esq., and brother of John Clayton, esq., Town Clerk, had filled a large place in the estimation of the public during his ministry, which, since his appointment to the hospital in 1826, had extended over thirty years. In addition to his clerical duties, in which he was able, faithful, affeetionate, and acceptable to an unusual degree, the rev. gentleman gave zealous and efficient assistance to the societies and institutions connected with the church, promoted large and flourishing schools in connection with his charge, officiated as Chaplain of the Victoria Blind Asylum, the Reformatory Schools, &c , and was most courteous, accessible, and beneficent to the poor In every relation of life, no man, probably, was ever more esteemed, and his unexpected decease created a melancholy void throughout the entire town."], [327, "A.D. 1856.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 321 1856 (October 21/\u2014 The Tyne Sailors' Home, erected at North Shields for the reception of mariners, was opened by the Duke of Northumberland, at whose expense this magnificent and important structure had been erected and furnished, the cost of which was upwards of \u00a38,000. The day was observed as a general holiday in North and South Shields ; the vessels in the harbour were gaily decorated with flags, and every token of joy was manifested by the entire population. During the morning the Corporations ofthe sister boroughs met in the Town Hall, North Shields, where luncheon was provided, and shortly before noon a procession was formed, consisting of 1,500 sailors from the neighbouring ports, (including a number of old veterans who had fought under Nelson and Collingwood), a large party of fishermen from Cullercoats, the members of the two Corporations, accompanied by the Mayors of Newcastle, Sunderland, and Gateshead, Mr. Ingham, M.P., Mr. Lindsay, M.P., and a great number of the principal ship- owners, &c, of the port. The procession was preceded by bands of music, banners, &c, and its route was lined by dense masses of spectators. His grace, on his arrival, was ushered into the spacious hall of the building, when the Mayors of Tynemouth and South Shields, the Sailors' Home Committee, and the pilots and fishermen of Cullercoats, severally presented him with congratu- latory addresses on the completion of his munificent gift to the sailors of the Tyne. His grace made a brief reply to the addresses, expressed his gratification at the increasing prosperity of the district, and trusted the institution would be found of essential benefit to a class who, too often, were saved from the sea to be shipwrecked on shore. He then declared the Home open, amidst the wildest enthusiasm. The noble duke was entertained at dinner during the afternoon in the Albion Inn. The chair was occupied by A. Bartleman, esq., and the vice-chairs by Messrs. R. Pow, J. Dryden, M. Popplewell, and Joseph Straker. Amongst the 400 gentlemen present were the chief magistrates of the towns in the district, Sir Matthew W. Ridley, bart., Sir W. B. Riddell, bart., Hon. H. G. Liddell, M.P., Mr. Ingham, M.P., Mr. Lindsay, M.P , Mr. Headlam, M P., Mr. H. Taylor, Captain Collinson, Mr. G. Burdon, Mr. T. Barker, &c, &c. The Sailors' Home was constructed from designs by Mr. B. Green, and is in the Ionic style of architecture. It is 95 feet in length by 83 feet in depth, and, besides having accommodation at present for sixty seamen and with room for ninety more, the building contains offices for the Marine Board, Shipping Master, Savings' Bank, &c, &c. The sum of \u00a32,000, produced by public subscription, was invested for the endowment of the institution.

At Tynemouth several ships were seen to founder off the bar, and a number of vessels were stranded at the mouth of the river. The crew of the George IV, on arriving at Shields, reported having seen nine vessels go down with all hands oft the Yorkshire coast. At Sunderland nine ships were lost, and upwards of twenty others were shipwrecked in the neighbourhood of Hartlepool, and seven more between Amble and North Sunder land. Only a rough estimate could be formed of the losses sustained during the storm, as the most terrible element in the calculation was the number of vessels that foundered at sea. It was supposed that upwards of thirty had so suffered. At Castle Eden the crew of a vessel named the Era was saved from certain destruction by the exertions of Rowland Burdon, esq., and his servants, and the men were taken to his mansion and most hospitable attended to by Mrs. Burdon. January 20. \u2014 Died, at Hexham, aged 110, Mr. John Bell, The deceassd's descendants were 111 in number at the time of his death. February 20. \u2014 An alarming explosion took place this morning in the ship Prince Phillippe, of Ostend, then lying in the river at South Shields. The vessel had received a cargo of coals on the 18th, when the hatches had been incautiously fastened down, but in what manner the gas had been ignited was not ascertained. The vessel was completely destroyed, and a sailor, named Mars, was blown to a great distance and drowned in the river, and several of the crew were seriously injured.

April 8. \u2014 A melancholy circumstance occurred at West Boldon, resulting in the sudden and awful death of a young man, aged 18, son of Mr. Snowden, farmer, and his farm servant, William Ridley, aged 35. Young Snowden and Ridley were employed in a field between Newcastle and Sunderland, where they were seen at work apparently nothing ailing a quarter of an hour previously by a carter, named Henderson, who had his attention called to the two poor fellows in consequence of young Snowden calling out to him to come to their assistance. Henderson imme diately left his horses, and went forward and found Ridley with a mark of blood on his face lying on the ground insensible ; he also observed a black mark round one of Snowden's eyes. He earnestly endeavoured to get an explanation from Snowden, but in vain. A passing train having called his attention to his horses he left them, under the impression that they had been fighting. Within a few minutes of Henderson leaving them, several persons hastened to the spot and found them both insensible. They were carried to West Boldon, but they had scarcely arrived before the vital spark had fled, and their bodies speedily became blackened all over. Medical gentlemen were called in, but, unfortunately, too late to be of any avail. It was supposed, from the fact of some of the root of the Cicuta Virosa, with teeth marks in it been found close to the spot where the men were lying, that they had been eating this poisonous substance, and so perished in the lamentable manner related. The occurrence caused an immense sensation and grief for miles around the locality.

W. Swinburne and Co.'s glass works, South Shields, was discovered to be in flames. The buildings were completely destroyed, together with a large quantity of glass. The damage was estimated at about \u00a33,000. After this disaster the firm relinquished the manufacture of crown glass, for which the Tyne was once famous, the improvements in the production of plate glass having rendered the former business unremunerative. May 13. \u2014 This day the site of the old Orphan House, in Northumberland-street, Newcastle, was the scene of a highly interesting ceremony. Some little time previous, the chapel and schools there, which had been erected about one hundred and fifteen years before, by the founder of Methodism, the Rev. John Wesley, for divine worship and for the education of orphans and others that might attend, were taken down, with the view of having extensive Wesleyan day-schools constructed on the site. The proceedings of the day commenced by a public breakfast, at which upwards of two hundred and sixty ladies and gentlemen were present, in Rogerson's Exchange Hotel, John B.

Robert Young, President of the Conference, a native of the banks of the Tyne ; the Rev. John Scott, Principal of the Wesleyan Normal Institution, Westminster, and Chairman of the Wesleyan Educational Committee ; and Mr. J. B. Falconar. His son, Mr. Falconar, jun., secretary to the fund, also took part in the proceedings, which were concluded by the National Anthem. In the evening a public meeting was held in Brunswick-place Chapel, at which Mr. Ralph Wilson presided, and Mr. J. B. Alexander, in addition to the gentlemen already named, addressed the audience. The erection of the schools, master's house, and shops had been contracted for with Messrs.

The Prince having been equipped in a suitable dress, immediately descended the shaft, and was conducted through some of the workings by Mr. Heckells, where his Royal Highness made numerous and pertinent inquiries as to the manner iu which a colliery is conducted, and expressed himself highly gratified by his visit. After his return to the surface the Prince drove to Lambton Castle, where he par took of luncheon, and proceeded on his journey southward during the afternoon. 185 7 (May 3 1 )\u25a0 \u2014 Two young men, named Joseph Anderson Mason, the son of a corn miller, near Leeds, and Joseph Peacock, of Bishopwearmouth Flour Mills, were drowned whilst bathing in the sea, near Sunderland South Dock.

The other young man, George Adamson, also tried every means in his power to save the other two, but in vain. The bodies were interred on the 23rd, when a person, named Collingwood Anderson, went into the belfiy of the church to toll the bell. The peal ceasing abruptly, Mrs. Anderson ascended the tower to ascertain the cause, and found her husband, with the rope in his hand, quite dead. These melancholy occurrences created a great sensation in the town of Alnwick. Ralph Shepherd was a native, and was very generally esteemed as an amiable, steady, and promising young man. June 23. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. G. Forster's Underhand (Plumb), beating Lord Zetland's Skirmisher by half a head, El Hakim, Pantomime, Mongrel, Vandal, and Baroda. It was remarked to be one of the finest races between first and second that had ever been seen. The chief incident of Thursday was that the \" Cup\" disappeared from the card, owing to the want of nomina tions. The Cup was established in 1799, and was always the most interesting race of the meeting, until the establishment of the Northumberland Plate in 1833, since which date the one had declined in popularity as the other had advanced. July 5. \u2014 About two o'clock this afternoon a terrific thunder storm broke over the village of Hylton, near Sunderland, when a little boy, named George Haddock, son of Robert Haddock, sawyer, was killed ou tho spot by the electric fluid. He was returning"], [333, "A.D. 1857.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 327 home, preceded a few paces by an elder brother, who was carrying another little fellow on his back, these latter felt the shock, as of a sudden blow, which knocked off the cap of the little fellow, and, on turning round to pick it up, they found their little brother lying on the ground dead. 1857 (July 15.) \u2014 This being the seventh anniversary of the pas sing of the Tyne Conservancy Act, the Commissioners determined upon celebrating it by perambulating the boundaries of their juris diction. The procession left Newcastle a little after five o'clock in the morning, amidst ringing of bells, salutes of cannon, and cheers of the spectators, accompanied by a number of steam vessels and gaily decorated boats. The company on passing the various manu factories, were saluted by discharges of cannon. Upon reaching the Low Lights the party landed and were received by the Mayor and members of the Corporation of Tynemouth, the River Com missioners residing at North and South Shields, and numerous in fluential gentlemen. After breakfasting at the Albion Hotel, the Commissioners re-embarked, and proceeded to Spar Hawk, where Mr. Wake, harbour-master, made the usual proclamation, setting forth the rights, powers, and jurisdiction of the Tyne Commissioners. Several boat races then took place, after which the procession re turned up the river, and, upon reaching Hedwin Streams, the western termination of their journey, the proclamation was again made, amidst great acclamation. Boat racing and other amuse ments took place during the afternoon, near the King's Meadows, aud everything passed off in an agreeable manner. July 22. \u2014 An unexpected gaol delivery, in anticipation of the coming assizes, took the town of Newcastle by surprise this morn ing. From an investigation instituted by the magistrates, it ap peared that two men, named Blakeston Hind and George Bell Winship, well-known lawless characters, who were committed to take their trial at the ensuing assizes, charged with garotting Mr. William Oley, near the Cattle Market, and robbing him of a large sum of money, also a ticket-of-leave convict, named William Hayes Beaumont, committed to the assizes for a garotte robbery at Arthur's Hill, and a fourth man, named John Harris, a tailor, com mitted to the assizes for a murderous assault upon his paramour, had made their escape. The prisoners had effected their liberation through the inadvertance of a turnkey, who had left their cells un locked. The captives, it afterwards appeared, had joined their bedding together in a sort of rope, and, having scaled the roof of a workshop, which adjoins the outer wall, they succeeded in even tually lowering themselves down to the street, a height of upwards of twenty feet, when they were free. On the 27th, however, Beau mont and Harris were captured in Carlisle, and the latter was sentenced to death on the following day, a sentence which was commuted to transportation for life. The bill against Beaumont was ignored. July 23.\u2014 The foundation-stone of the new Reformatory Institu tion, situated at Netherton, near Morpeth, for the benefit of the"], [334, "328 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a,D. 1857. offending juveniles of the Northern Counties, was laid by the Right Hon. Earl Grey, the president of the society, in the presence of a very numerous assemblage of the magistrates and other influential inhabitants of the district. After performing the customary ceremony the noble earl briefly addressed the spectators, congratulating them upon the successful progress of the institution, dnd the party then adjourned to a pavilion and sat down to luncheon, his lordship presiding. The building, which was, designed by R. B. Sanderson, jun., esq., has accommodation for 100 boys, it is a plain but substantial erection, and 30 acres of ground adjacent have been taken for the industrial employment of the inmates. The cost of the ground and building was estimated at \u00a33,350. 1857 (July 26).- \u2014 This afternoon, about five o'clock, as a number of persons were bathing at the Short Sands, Tynemouth, one of them, Mr. Jacob Cresswell, of Wreckenton, having gone too far, was carried away by the current, and was seen struggling in great distress. A cry being raised, Mr. James Grant, of Newcastle, and Mr. Hodgson, of Sunderland, who were walking in the Battery, instantly rushed down the banks, and without taking off their clothes plunged into the sea. By the time Mr. Grant had got to the place Mr. Cresswell had sunk. The former, however, dived down and brought him up, and then, with the assistance of Mr. Hodgson swam ashore with him, amidst the plaudits of the spectators. Being in an exhausted state he had to be carried to the Rock Cottage, where the usual remedies for restoring animation were applied for about two hours, after which he was able to leave in the company of his friends, to the great joy of them all. Mr. Hodgson is well known as the \" Stormy Petrel,\" having been the means of saving a great number of persons from drowning, and had received several medals, the last one (a gold one) from the Emperor of the French for rescuing the crew of a French vessel at Sunderland the previous winter. August 5. \u2014 At an early hour this morning great alarm was created amongst the dense population near the New Quay, North Shields, in consequence of the extensive flour mill and canvas factory belonging to Messrs. W. Brown and Sons being discovered to be in a blaze of fire, causing the utmost consternation amongst the occupiers of the tenemented property adjoining, who fled precipitately from their houses, placing their furniture and effects hastily on the New Quay. So rapid had been the progress of the flames after their discovery by the police, that the flour mill was entirely destroyed, along with the valuable stock and machinery, before almost an effort could be made to save them. August 6. \u2014 A most singularly horrible fatality occurred this day to a pitman, named Henry Hunter, at the Elemore Colliery, in the county of Durham It appeared that hunter and another man, named George Lishman, having finished work, came to the bottom of the shaft to be drawn up. They both placed their feet in the loop of a chain, to which they held with their hands when"], [335, "A.D. 1857.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 329 they began to ascend. After being drawn about half the distance, a loop in the descending chain, by some means, got over Hunter's head, and before he was able to extricate himself, or give any signal, his head was torn completely from his body. Horrible to relate, the headless trunk of what a few seconds before had been a living man came to bank along with Lishman, the feet in the loop and the hands still grasping the chain. 1857 (August 8/ \u2014 The work people, men and boys, employed in the numerous and extensive collieries of Frances Anne, Marchioness of Londonderry, to the number of nearly 4,000, were entertained at dinner by her ladyship, in a large and commodious wooden structure, erected for the occasion, in the beautifully wooded grounds of Seaham Hall. The arrangements of the immense building were such as would provide room for 4,000 persons, in addition to which there were galleries for a large number of spectators, and a raised dais, designed for the marchioness and her principal guests. The pillars and roof were covered with floral devices of the most ingenious description, and at intervals appro- priate mottoes were interspersed. The dais, which was upwards of seventy feet in length, was most elaborately decorated, and vines, melons, and numerous choice specimens of horticulture were tastefully disposed in front, amidst a profusion of hanging drapery and flowers. To give an idea of the internal decorations it may be mentioned that 8,000 artificial flowers and 18 waggon loads of evergreens were used on the occasion, and the task of disposing them was executed under the superintendence of Mr. Craig, of Houghton-le-Spring, Mrs. Richardson and Mrs. Usher, of Seaham Harbour, and Mrs. Ferme and Miss Hindhaugh, of Pensher. As the hour approached which had been appointed for the commence- ment of the repast, the weather brightened up, and thousands of people in holiday trim, began to converge towards Seaham Park. By half-past one o'clock the whole of the men had arrived, and the firing of cannon announced the approach of the marchioness. Her ladyship on taking her place on the platform was accompanied by the Right Hon. the Bishop of Durham, Lord Adolphus Vane Tempest, M.P., the Hon. John Vandeleur Stewart, Hugh Taylor, esq , and a number of gentleman connected with the district. Grace having been said by the Rev. A. Bethune, such a clatter of knives and forks ensued amongst the guests as is seldom heard, and the immense rounds of beef and joints of mutton disappeared with astonishing celerity. Lord Adolphus Vane Tempest occupied the chair after dinner. In the course of the proceedings the marchioness intimated that if her workmen were willing to com bine for the purpose of supporting their aged and infirm brethern, she would readily be at the expense of ereeting a suitable building for the purpose, which should be termed the Pitmen's Home. After various speeches and toasts the assemblage dispersed in the utmost good order, all apparently delighted with the proceedings in which they had participated. August 12. \u2014 A lamentable accident occurred at Windsor, vol in. t 1"], [336, "330 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1857. this morning, which terminated in the death of Lieutenant James Delaval Shafto, of the Royal Horse Guards Blue, and owner of Bavington estate, in the county of Northumberland. It appeared that the deceased and his brother officers were in the habit of bathing in the Thames, and that this morning, about nine o'clock, the lieutenant, accompanied by Captain Billington, proceeded to the river for that purpose. They had not been long in the water, however, before it was discovered that Lieutenant Shafto was sinking. Captain Billington immediately swam to the rescue, but was unsuccessful. Leutenant Shafto, who was only in his 28th year, entered the army as cornet in March, 1852, and purchased his lieutenancy in December, 1854. The loss of this much respected young officer cast a gloom upon both officers and men of the regiment at Windsor, and his untimely death was much regretted in this neighbourhood, where he was well known and respected sor his courteous and many amiable qualities. 1857 (August 16/ \u2014 This afternoon three boys, Evans Butcher, Thomas Watson, and James Thompson, the eldest only eleven years of age, put out to sea from Shields harbour, to fish. A boat, with some other boys, went out with them, but, a fog coming on, they put in towards the land, which they reached in safety. The other lads refused to come ashore, and the fog becoming more dense, their parents watched on the beach with the greatest anxiety. A powerful steamer, belonging to the South Shields pilots, went out in search of them, and several of their friends put out to sea in a coble on the same errand. During the night cries of distress were heard in the neighbourhood of the Herd Sand, and upon boats putting out, it was discoverd that the coble, with the friends of the boys, had grounded there. They were brought ashore. The steamer also returned to the port in the course of the morning, but no intelligence could be learned of the poor boys. Towards evening, however, when their homes were filled with lamentations, they unexpectedly cast up. It appeared that they had pulled about all night, utterly lost, but towards morning they obseived a light, which they made towards. In pulling in they were fortu nately met by Mr. Bruce, a pilot, who took them ashore, landing them at Seaham Harbour, which light they had observed fourteen miles from home, and they had made their way across the country to Shields, arriving just as all hope of their safety was abandoned. August 29. \u2014 A melancholy and fatal accident occurred to Mr. John Emmerson, father of Dr. Emmerson, of North Shields, whilst bathing near the south pier, at the mouth of the Tyne, There being a good deal of swell, and the deceased being in feeble health, he was knocken down, and carried by the back sweep of the waves into the tide which sets round the end of the pier works with considerable force. Three young men, assistants in Mr. Corder's drapery establishment, South Shields, swam out to his assistance. One of them got him upon his shoulders, and the other two attempted to tow them into the shore ; but the tide was sweeping out with such force to the sea, that, after a"], [337, "A.D. 1857.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 331 desperate effort to save him, they were obliged to let him go, and they were so exhausted with their efforts that others had to go out to their help. The poor old man continued to float furtherBout to sea, when Mr. Hudson, a young man in Humphrey, and Evans' establishment, gallantly leaped off the pier and swam out to him, but the current kept forcing them out to sea, and, to save his own life, he was obliged at last to abandon Mr. Emmerson, who shortly afterwards sank. During the afternoon the body was found at a short distance from the place. 1857 (September 2). \u2014 Married, at Aughnamullen, county of Monaghan, Ireland, Robert Plummer, jun., esq., of Byker, New- castle, to Mary Eleanor, eldest daughter of Captain Johnstone, of Millmore Eouse, and granddaughter of Richard Downing, esq., Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In celebration of the auspicious event great rejoicings were held among the work people at the North- umberland Flax Mills, Ouseburn, Newcastle, belonging to the firm of Messrs. Ciarke, Plummer, and Co., of which the respected bridegroom was a member. Flags gaily floated on the summit of the mill, the entrance to which was surmounted by an arch, adapted for illumination, and which presented, with the initials of the bride and bridegroom, an illuminated star and other appropriate emblems, together with the motto \" God bless the union.\" In the evening about a hundred of the workmen sat down to dinner in the inn of Mrs. Taylor, adjoining the works, under the presidency of Mr. Hugh Sutherland, head manager, and Mr. Fenwick, under manager. The dinner, which was most sumptuous and varied, was provided by the order of Mr. Plummer, after which there was an unlimited supply of wines, spirits, cigars, &c, and from the outset the whole affair, under the inspiring influence of the occasion, and the able and energetic presidency of Mr. Sutherland, went off in the most spirited and enthusiastic manner. On the same evening all the clerks connected with the joint establishments of Matthew Plummer and Co., and Clarke, Plummer, and Co., along with some private friends, were entertained at the Three Indian Kings' Inn, Quayside, to a most elegaut and sumptuous banquet, at which the wines were of the rarest and choicest description. Mr. Anderson presided and Mr. Rowell occupied the vice-chair. After passing a most agreeable evening the proceedings terminated amidst the greatest harmony and satisfaction to all. September 2. \u2014 This Morning the stackyard of Mr. Thomas Snowdon, at the Blue Quarries, near Gateshead, was discovered to be in flames. Two fire-engines soon arrived from Newcastle, but, owing to a want of water, it was two o'clock in the afternoon before the fire was got under, when the contents of the stackyard had been almost entirely consumed. These consisted of eight stacks of new wheat, just carted from the field ; 2 stacks of old wheat ; and 3 stacks of hay. The damage was estimated at \u00a34004 The fire was supposed to be the work of an incendiary. Mr Snowden was uninsured."], [338, "332 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1857. 1857 (September 19). \u2014 This evening a fire broke out in Mr. Mawsons' chemical establishment, Mosley-street, Newcastle, which speedily presented such an alarming appearance that considerable fears were entertained for the adjoining property. A flood of water poured in by a hose, prevented the spread of the fire and ensured its extinction in a very brief period, not, however, till damage had been done to the stock and premises to the extent of \u00a3300. The fire was occasioned by the neglect or inadvertance of one of the junior apprentices, named John Wilkinson, who was so severely burnt that he died of his injuries, at the infirmary, on the following day. September 23. \u2014 This evening, a fire of an alarming character occured at the premises of Messrs. Daglish and Ismay, wholesale chemists, Sandhill, Newcastle. The premises were well known as a portion of the old fashioned buildings, projecting at each storey, which have a most picturesque appearance. In consequence of the large amount of timber used in tbe construction of these houses, and the inflammable nature of the stock in Daglish and Ismay's warehouses, the flames very rapidly extended, although the exertions of the firemen and the police were most effective. The public house of Mrs Aisbett adjoining, and the premises occupied by Mr. Potts, spirit merchant, were much injured. Alderman Philipson, the Sheriff, and W. Woods, esq., chairman of the Newcastle Fire Office, were on the spot, and, by their ready foresight and valuable suggestions to those engaged in the active work of subduing the devouring element, were instrumental in saving a large amount of property that must otherwise have suffered. A hose and a body of men from the North-Eastern Railway Company's establishment, under the direction of Mr. Smart, station-master, rendered essential service. About midnight the fire was completely subdued. October 8. \u2014 The eminent and valuable services of Walter Johnson, esq., as secretary of the Northumberland Agricultural Society, received an appropriate and substantial acknowledgemment in a testsmonial, presented to him at a public dinner given at Morpeth. The testimonial consisted of an elegant silver epergne and four handsome corner dishes, value j\u00a3230, and a purse of gold containing \u00a3270, making \u00a3500 subscribed by the members of the society and others, and the entertainment at which it was presented was held in the Borough School Room, and was attended by nearly 150 ofthe most influntial gentry, land owners, and agriculturalists connected with the society. The epergne and dishes were from Messrs. Reid and Sons, Newcastle, and the three shields of the epergne contained the following inscription : \u2014 \" This epergne, together with four silver corner dishes and 270 sovereigns, was presented to Mr Walter Johnson, at a public dinner, at Morpeth, on the 8th day of October, 1857, by the members of the North umberland Agricultural Society, in approbation of his assiduous services as their secretary for thirteen years.

The expenses connected with tbe church amounted to about \u00a32,000, and of this sum the Dean and Chapter contributed \u00a3200, the Grange Coal Company \u00a350, Sir George Musgrave, bart., \u00a350, the late W. Standish Standish, esq., \u00a320, Charles Robinson, esq., \u00a320, and Mr. R. L. Pem berton, esq., \u00a320, besides the site. There had been several minor subscriptions, but a considerable portion of the expense and trouble fell upon the incumbent, the Rev T. C. Crossman. The church is a good specimen of a country parish church, and is in the early decorated style, October 22. \u2014 This day the completion of the Northumberland Dock, wich is situated at Hayhole, on the north bank of the Tyne, near Noith Shields, was celebrated by a grand inaugural ceremony. The dock is named after His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, who afforded his invaluable advice and assistance in the commence ment and progress of the work ; and, in compliance with the cordial invitation of the River Tyne Commissioners, under whose immediate auspices the work had been carried out, his grace appropriately performed the inaugural ceremony of laying the coping-stone, and presiding at the magnificent banquet provided on the occasion. His grace, who appeared in excellent health, arrived in Newcastle, from Alnwick, about ten in the forenoon, and was welcomed by the chairman and members of the River Commission, &c, and the party shortly afterwards embarked at Newcastle Quay on board the barge, and were towed down the river by the Margaret Aynsley steamer, accompanied by the Master and Brethren of the Trinity House on board the Pilot steamer; the Mayor and Cor poration of Gateshead on board of the Ocean Bridge ; the four Shields lifeboats, manned with Tyne pilots ; the Harbour Masters in their boats, &c The small but gay marine procession, consisting of steamers, barges, &c, proceeded down the river, the banks of which presented indications of the auspicious event to be celebrated in the course of the day. On arriving at the dock an open space was reserved for the ceremony, and the chairman of the Commission presented to his grace a handsome silver trowel, manufactured by Messrs. Reid and Sons, bearing the following inscription : \u2014 \" To the Most Noble Algernon, Duke and Earl of Northumberland, K.G, this trowel was presented by the River Tyne Commissioners on laying the coping-stone of the Northum berland Dock, 22nd of October, 1857.\" The necessary preparations having been made, his grace performed the ceremony with a happy dexterity, and the conclusion of it was accompanied by the cheers of the assembled multitude and the booming of cannon from the heights. October 22. \u2014 This day St. John's, Westgate, and Elswick cemetery, which is beautifully situated in Elswick-lane, was"], [340, "334 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1857. opened for interments, when the infant son of Mr. Owen, chemist, Newcastle (a member of the Burial Board), was buried within the portion intended for consecration. The chairman of the Board, John Burnup, esq., was the first purchaser of two vaults on the same side of the cemetery. 1857 (November 3). \u2014 The Mayor of Sunderland and Mrs. Mayoress gave a grand ball and supper in the Athen\u00e6um Rooms, Sunder land. Joseph Simpson, esq., acted as master of the ceremonies, and led off the ball in a country dance with Miss Ranson, daughter of the mayor, who followed with Mrs. William Ord. Quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and galops followed in rapid succession till midnight, when the supper-room was thrown open, and the guests were entertained at one of the most elegant and most luxurious banquets that was ever given in Sunderland, every delicacy of the season and the choicest wines being provided with profuse liberality. Upwards of 200 of the principal inhabitants of the neighbourhood were present, including both the members for the borough, Robert Ingham, esq., MP., the Mayor of New castle, &c, &c. Aovember 9. \u2014 The annual election of chief magistrates took place, with the following results : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Anthony Nichol, esq., mayor; John Ormston, esq., sheriff.

November 26. \u2014 This morning the Northumberland and Durham District Bank suspended operations. This vast and thriving community \u2014 Newcastle and neighbourhood \u2014 was altogether unprepared for the intelligence, which transpired on the previous day, after bank hours, by telegraph from London, that the drafts of the bank had been dishonoured by its London Agents, Messrs. Barclay and Co., and Messrs. Glynn and Co. Any vague hope, still indulged, that such a result might be averted were extinguished this morning by the bank remaining closed, and the following notice being posted up : \u2014 \" The Directors of the Northumberland and Durham District Banking Company lament to announce that, owing to the long continued monetary pressure and the difficulty of rendering available the resources of the bank, they have felt themselves obliged to suspend its operations Deposits and credit balances will be fully paid with as little delay as possible.\" It is a remarkable, though painful fact, that every Joint- Stock Bank, established in Newcastle aud immediate neigh bouihood, has passed the destructive ordeal of suspending payments, and inflicting grievous injury upon almost innu merable shareholders of all ranks and classes. They may be enumerated as follows: \u2014 The Newcastle-upon-Tyne Joint- Stock Bank ; The North of England Banking Company ; The Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland Union Banking Company;"], [341, "A.D. 1857.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 335 The Newcastle Commercial Banking Company ; The Sunderland Joint-Stock Bank ; and The Northumberland and Durham District Banking Company. 1857 (December 24^). \u2014 An alarming fire broke out this afternoon in the stack-yard of Mr. James Howey, of West Hepple, near Rothbury, caused by some children igniting a stack of straw with lucif'er matches. The Rothbury fire engine arrived about four o'clock, but the scarcity of water for some time prevented its operations, and it was only by carting from the river Coquet that the engine could be supplied. The want was at length overcome by the arrival of several additional water carts, which enabled the engine to keep the flames so much in check as to prevent the ignition of the buildings, but the fire was not entirely subdued till about ten o'clock, by which time three large stacks of wheat, two of barley, and six of oats were totally destroyed. December 30. \u2014 A grand ball, on a scale of unusual splendour, was given at the magnificent baronial residence of the Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth, at Ravensworth Castle. The castle, the scene of the festive gatherinng, is most beautifully situated a little to the north-west of Lamesley, and occupies a gentle declivity, sloping from the west. At a distance of half a mile westward the ground swells to a mountainous ridge, covered with large forest trees, and the magnificent scene closes the prospect in that direc tion. The southern front overlooks the vale of Ravensworth, and the northern front faces towards the Tyne. The old castle at Ravensworth was a place of considerable antiquity, and no doubt also of strength, but in 1808 nearly the whole of the old house was taken down, and the present splendid mansion erected, the style of which is a selection fiom the castle architecture of different periods. As seen from the north-east the castellated outlines are exceedingly beautiful and picturesque. Still finer is the view as\" the castle is approached through its spacious lawns, interspersed with shrubbery and time-honoured oak and other trees, while the interior, in respect to architectural arrangement, beauty of decora- tion, and appropriate furnishing, combines magnificence with utility and comfort in a degree scarcely to be equalled and certainly not surpassed by the most sj)lendid palatial residence. His lord- ship having been entertaining a numerous and brillant company, gave a grand ball to all the leading families of the two counties of Northumberland and Durham. A numerous and effective band was present under the able leadership of Mr Liddell. The ball was led off by Lord Ravensworth and the Marchioness of London derry. The programme was exceedingly choice, and comprised the most charming and fashionable music of the day. Refresh ments, varied and delicate, were provided, and everything had been marked by the utmost regularity, ease, and comfort, and notwith- standing the greatness of the gathering and the brilliancy of their reception, the whole were met and most admirably provided for, without appearing to tax anything beyond the ordinary and well conducted resources of the castle."], [342, "336 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1858. 1858 (January 7/\u2014 The melancholy intelligence ofthe death of the brave Sir Henry Havelock, reached Sunderland, his native town, this day, by telegraph, and was received by all classes with expressions of the most profound regret. No soldier in living memory has gone to an honoured grave more invested with the glory of his chivalrous deeds, or more lamented by all classes of his grateful countrymen. A gloom appeared on every countenance, both young and old, and the sole topic of conversation during the day was the great loss sustained by a brave army, in a critical and momentous emergency, and by the nation, of one of her most devoted and gallant chiefs, who combined the highest qualities of the soldier with the faith and virtues of an eminent christian. The national flag was hoisted half-staff high on the tower ot Sunderland Church, and the minute-bell tolled through out the day, in honour of the memory of the departed hero. Sir Henry Havelock, and his no less gallant brother Colonel William Havelock, were born at Ford Hall, in the parish of Bishopwear mouth, in which church the two brothers were baptized on the 13th of April, 1796. The baptism of the youthful Havelocks is thus entered in the parish register of Bishopwearmouth Church : \u2014 \"William, son of William and Jane Havelock, of Ford, born January 21, 1793; Henry, son of William and Jane Havelock, of Ford, born April 5th, 1795. Baptized April 13th, 1796.\" In 1842 Sir Henry Havelock commanded the right column of the handful of brave men (not exceeding 1,700) under the gallant General Sale, when a glorious victory was obtained over Akhbar Khan's numerous army at Jellalabad. He was appointed a Companion of the most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, for the important services which he rendered on that occasion, and was afterwards honourably mentioned for his servicee at the battles of Tezeen. Istaliff, and Ferozipore, at which latter engagement his conduct commanded the esteem and admiration of the late Sir John McCaskill. At the sanguinary and decisive battle of Sobraon, he assisted in conveying the Commander-in-Chief's orders to various points \" in the thickest of the fight and the hottest of the fire.\" He was appointed to the 2nd division of the English army in the last Persian war, and commanded the troops at the closing victory of Bohammerah. During the great Indian rebellion, in 1857, his martial achievements, under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty, were the wonder and admiration of the world, and of* whom it may be justly said, that he was the saviour of England's honour, and the avenger of her wrongs. He won twelve battles, captured upwards of one hundred cannon, and had five horses shot under him. He was created a Knigt Commander of the Bath on the Ilth, and on the 27th was gazetted to a baronetcy, but dying, near Lucknow, on the 24tn of November, 1857, the patent could not take effect. It was, however, conferred on his gallant son (who, during this campaign was severely wounded and had a horse shot under him), Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Marshman Havelock, V.C., C.B., who subsequently married"], [343, "A.D. 1858.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 337 the Lady Alice Moreton, daughter of the, late Earl Ducie. Sir Henry Havelock was the author of a \" Histroy of the Burmese War,\" and of a \" History of the War in Afghanistan in 1838-9.\" These works possess a \" storehouse of information,\" and are written in a correct and graphic style, precisely as might be expected from a military officer and an educated gentleman. A third brother, Charles Frederick Havelock, was a Lieutenant- Colonel in the British army, aud Major-General in the Imperial Ottoman Army, where he achieved much fame as a leader of cavalry, and received the Order of Medjidie. His only son was killed in battle. The youngest brother, Thomas, was killed in the Spanish service. The eldest, Lieutenant-Colonel William Have- lock, K.H., was engaged in all the victories of the Peninsula, and was wounded at Waterloo, where he was Aide-de- Camp to Baron Alten, and received the cross of the Hanover Guelphic Order. The following singular act of heroism is recorded of him in Napier's \"Peninsular War\": \u2014 \" There, however, he (Giron) was arrested by a strong line of abbattis, from behind which two French regiments poured a deadly fire. The Spaniards stopped, and, though the adventurer Downie, now a Spauish General, encouraged them with his voice, and they kept their ranks, they seemed irresolute and did not advance. There happened to be present an officer of the 43rd regiment, named Havelock, who, being attached to General Alten's staff, was sent to ascertain Giron's progress. His fiery temper could not brook the check. He took off his hat, called upon the Spaniards to follow him, aud, putting spurs to his horse, at one bound cleared the abbattis, and went headlong among the enemy. Then the soldiers, shouting for ' El Chico Blanco' (the fair boy \u2014 so they called him, for he was very young, and had light hair), with one shock broke through the French, and this at the very moment when their centre was flying under the fire of Kemps' skirmishers from the Puerto de Vera.\" This gallant soldier was killed on the 22nd of November, 1848, whilst fighting at the head of his regiment, the 14th Light Dragoons, on the bank of the Chenab, near the ford of Ramnugger, in North Western India. The 3rd and 4th Light Dragoons had been sent to dislodge a body of Sikh Cavalry, which opened right and left to let them pass, until the dragoons, with Colonel Havelock at their head, were brought up by a nullah or ravine, full of matchlock men, who opened a galling fire on the Europeans. A more fearful sight was never witnessed on a field of battle, for the British army stood drawn up. both artillery and infantry, silent spectators of the bloody conflict of 450 sabres against an army amounting to more than 15,000 men, with heavy cannon. Havelock, cheering, led on his squadrons down to the bank, then into the nullah, crossed it at a gallop, and coming to close quarters with the Sikhs, charged through and through their ranks and sabred hundreds of the enemy under the most frightful showers of missiles from their cannon and matchlocks. The British retired a short distance, formed up, were joined by the remainder of their corps, and again they went to work. Then, amidst a terrific can- VOL. Hi. H 1"], [344, "338 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1858. nonade from the enemy's artillery, which swept away both men and horses, and a shower of bullets, which fell among the troops like hail, the gallant Havelock, in the front of his regiment, charged amidst the fire from the batteries of the enemy, and met his death. He had his right arm severely wounded, and his left leg and left arm nearly cut off, and was left dead upon the field. Eleven of his men fell fighting by his side, and their decapitated bodies were found a fortnight after, when they were buried. It is said that during this charge, one of the most brilliant on record, \" the deportment of Havlock was more that of a mortal confiding in the protection of the \u00c6gis of some divinity than that of an ordinary human being.\" A monument was erected in All Saints' Church, Maidstone, by the officers ofthe 14th Light Dragoons, in honour of this daring Sabreur. 1858 (January 1 lj. \u2014 This day the Orphan House Schools, situate in Northumberland-street, Newcastle, were opened, when nearly a hundred scholars were entered. Mr. B. Shaw was appointed teacher of the boys, and Miss Walker of the girls The estab lishment, which is capable of accommodating 400, is now in full operation. The event was celebrated, in the evening, by an over flowing company taking tea in that building, after which an adjournment was made to Brunswick-place Chapel. The Rev. R. Young, the Rev. M. C. Taylor (Secretary to the Wesleyan Normal Institution), Mr. J. B. Falconar, the Rev. W. W. Stamp, Mr. R. Wilson, the Rev. G. Bowden, and Mr. Shaw, the teacher, took part in the proceedings. January 19. \u2014 A very distressing accident occurred this evening, near Newcastle, by which a young man, about 19 years of age, Mr. James Armstrong, son of Charles Armstrong, esq., of Axwell Park, met a lamentable and premature death. It appeared that deceased, after business hours, having been detained later than usual, went with his brother Charles to partake of tea at Mr. Roach's, Grey-street, after which they prepared to go home, but the night being very boisterous they deemed it necessary to engage a cab. About half-way between the railway arch on the Scots wood-road and the Suspension Bridge the deceased got out of the cab for a moment. On attempting to re-enter the vehicle his hat struck against the upper part of the doorway and fell to the ground, and, as he was in the act of picking it up, a pistol, which he carried loaded in his pocket, exploded, and its contents lodged in his abdomen. In a state of excruciating agony he was rapidly driven home, where he died in less than half an hour, in the presence of his afflicted parents and other members of the family. January 25. \u2014 On the auspicious occasion of the marriage of the Princess Royal there was a general suspension of business operations in Newcastle, the Mayor having intimated his wishes to that effect. The banks, public offices, warehouses, manufac tories, and shops were consequently closed, and the day observed as a holiday, as a mark of respect and attachment to her majesty and the royal family. The bells of the various churches rung"], [345, "A.D. 1858.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 339 merry peals from early morn till near midnight, and the firing of guns from various establishments on the banks of the river was heard during the whole day. Flags were displayed from the Castle, the Grey Monument, Albion House, the Shot Tower, the Gaol, &c, &c. The other towns in the district exhibited their loyalty in a similar manner ; and in the evening the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle (Anthony Nichol, esq.) gave a grand bali and entertainment at the Assembly Rooms, in honour of the event. The arrangements for the occasion were very exten sive, and were carried into effect with admirable order and precision. The front of the building was brilliantly illuminated, and within there was a profuse decoration of shrubs and evergreens, whilst the flags of England and Prussia were unfurled in the principal apartment. There were about eight hundred ladies and gentlemen present, including most of the leading families of the town and neighbourhood, as well as the officers of the garrison. At ten o'clock the ball was led off by Mrs. Mayoress and the Sheriff John Ormston, esq.), the ex-mayor (E. N. Grace, esq.) dancing(with Mrs. Ormston. Quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and galops followed in rapid succession, and were maintained with great spirit until a late hour, when the numerous party broke up highly gratified with the pleasures of the evening, and the courteous attentions and liberal hospitality of the worthy Mayor and Mayoress. 1858 (February 23). \u2014 Great gloom was cast over the borough of Stockton, consequent on the untimely death, by his own hands, of the universally respected Town Clerk and Magistrates' Clerk, Joseph Radcliffe Wilson, esq., senior member of the well-known firm of Wilson, Faber, and Wilson, of that borough. This morning he left home with a black leather bag and a stick in his hand, stating that he was going to Hartlepool on business. A little before noon he was seen passing the village of Seaton, with his bag in his hand, and was no more seen alive. In the evening a hat was picked up beside Seaton Snook, by a young man, who took it to his father's house, when the family were horrified at seeing it bespattered with blood and a hole cut or torn in the inside. -About eleven o'clock the body of the deceased was found in a sand-hole, quite stiff and cold. Beneath the body was found a pistol, whilst another lay about two feet off, both having been discharged. On examining the head it was apparent that the deceased had committed suicide. The ball had entered the head in a slanting position, going through the brain, and passing out at the left side. Close to the deceased were his bag and walking-stick, both carefully laid upma small bank. The body was removed to the village, and on examining the bag it was found to contain a flask of gunpowder, balls, and wadding, and which were proved to be his own property. March 4. \u2014 An inquest was held at Alnmouth, before Mr. Hardy, coroner, on the bodies of three men which had been washed ashore this morning, within a few hundred yards of each other, on the coast near Foxton Hall. The bodies were those of the"], [346, "340 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a,D. 1858. unfortunate shipwrecked crew of the Nairns, all young men, their names were Thomas Lodge, Thomas Logan, and Thomas Stirling. On the following day another inquest was held, before the same coroner, on the body of John Harrison, which had been found lying on the sands at Alnmouth. Deceased was about 27 years of age, and had sailed as master of the Nairns for upwards of two years The jury in both cases returned a verdict of \" Found Drowned.\" 1858 (March 8/ \u2014 Between seven and eight o'clock this eveniug an alarming fire broke out in the boiler house of the extensive premises at St. Lawrence, occupied as a rope manufactory by Messrs. T. and W. Smith. Messengers were forthwith despatched for the police and fire-engines, and prompt measures were taken to prevent the spread of the flames, which had obtained complete mastery of tbe large cauldron in which the operation of \"tarring\" the yarn is performed, aud which, at the time of the disaster, was partly filled with tar in a state of fusion. From the vessel the flames shot high into the air, and threatened the entire premises with destruction, and as it appeared evident that any attempt to restrain them in this quarter would be useless, the efforts of the police and of the workmen were directed to cutting off the communication with the other portions of the ropery, which were fortunately successful. The buildings destroyed consisted of the boiler house, capstan house, and yarn store. In this latter place several hundred tons of yarn or twine were deposited, and this was either destroyed or rendered useless. The total damage was roughly estimated at over \u00a32,000. How the fire originated remained a mystery. March 11 \u2014 The Right Hon. Lord Lovaine, M.P. for the Northern Division of Noithumberland, having, by acceptance of office in the Derby Administration as a Lord of the Admiralty, rendered it necessary to present himself to his constituents, the writ for a new election was issued on the previous week, and the election was fixed by the High Sheriff to take place in the Town Hall at Alnwick this morning. The proceedings having been opened in due form, Charles William Orde, esq., of Nunnykirk, proposed, and Bryan Burrell, esq., of Broome Park, seconded the nomination. There being no opposition, the High Sheriff declared Lord Lovaine duly elected. March. \u2014 During this month a pointer, belonging to a gentle man at Bothal, near Morpeth, produced a litter of pups which were immediately ordered to be drowned. Great was the grief of poor Nell for the loss of her young ones. She howled and moaned incessantly for eight days, and then all at once became perfectly quiet. Her master, thinking she was either dead or reconciled, was very much surprised to find her lavishing her maternal affection on a sucking pig, which she had stolen from the sty and removed to an empty stall in the stable. Again she was bereft of her little porcine favourite, and on the following night she carried off* two pigs from the sty which she substituted"], [347, "A.D. 1858.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 341 for he own pups as before. The two pigs, like a second Romulus and Remus, appeared to enjoy very much the dugs of their foster mother. 1858 (April 2) \u2014 Mr. Henry Watt, the engineer, whoso case, in connection with his unjust imprisonment in Naples, had excited such universal sympathy, arrived in Newcastle this evening, and proceeded to his father's house, in Argyie-street. He looked much better than his friends had been led to expect. April 22. \u2014 The new church at Riding Mill was consecrated this day by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Durham. The church, which is & short distance from the Riding Mill Station, on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, is situated on the summit of the aclivity rising from the stream which runs past the village; and with its spire and outlines opening on the view \" half seen through the trees,\" as the visitor approaches it presents an extremely interesting appearance. The church, which is adapted to contain about 200 people, was designed by Mr. Matthew Thompson, Newcastle, and erected by Mr. J. D. Thompson. The cost of the church was about \u00a3900, and it would be difficult to find, with regard to internal comfort and accommodation, and symmetry of outline, a more beautiful specimen of the modern village church. May 16. \u2014 A most distressing accident occurred this afternoon, off Marsden Rock, by the upsetting of a boat, and the consequent loss of three lives. It appeared that Mr. Alexander McDonald, shopman with Messrs. Philipson and Hare, booksellers, North Shields, and Mr. John Cookson, assistant to Mr. Williamson, chemist, in the same town, had proceeded to Marsden in a large foy boat, named the Delhi, belonging to Mr. Wilkinson, and navigated by a man, named R. Coatsworth, and a lad, named Wheatley, 16 years of age, an apprentice to Mr. Smith, cabinet maker, South Shields. As they approached towards the shore they encountered some heavy seas, one of which struck the boat on the quarter and capsized her, throwing the four young men into the water. They could all swim, but McDonald and the two boatmen clung to the boat's bottom. In a few moments another sea struck and righted the boat, which it filled with water, separating those who had been clinging to it. Cookson succeeded in getting hold of an oar, and shot it towards McDonald, but the back sweep was so strong that he was obliged to relinquish it and make towards the boat. At this time a little dog, named Grip, belonging to McDonald, swam towards him with a piece of wood in its mouth, which it gave to him, but, of course, it was of little use. The three hung by the boat, which was full of water, for a minute, when Cookson saw another great wave surging towards them. He dived to avoid being struck, and when he came up he discovered that his companions had been swept into eternity, and that he and McDonald's dog were tossing about on the sea alone, about sixty or seventy yards from the shore, which he made desperate efforts to reach, throwing himself lengthways and ducking at each breaker, till, after a hard struggle with the back sweep, he"], [348, "342 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1858. found his feet touch the ground- Here one of the daughters of Mrs. Allan ran into the water and assisted him out. It was stated that she was engaged to McDonald. As soon as he was got on shore she asked how many there were in the boat, and observed if McDonald had been there none of them would have been lost. Cookson replied that McDonald was one of them, and the poor girl ran screaming to the house. Cookson was taken to the hotel, and speedily recovered. He was a powerful young fellow, and one of the best swimmers on the Tyne. He held several medals for skill in swimming, and won the silver medal of the Tynemouth Swimming Club on the previous summer. McDonald also held two medals, presented to him by tbe Royal Humane Society, one for rescuing a person at Blackwall, while he was an assistant with Messrs. Simpkin and Marshall, in London, and the other for having, along with R. M. Tate, of North Shields, saved a woman from drowning at Chorley. McDonald's faithful dog Grip saved himself by swimming to shore when all was over. 1858 ( May 27^). \u2014 The extensive premises known as the Friars' Goose Chemical Works were put up for sale, this afternoon, by Mr. Brough, auctioneer, at the Queen's Head Hotel, Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, under the orders of the assignees of Mr. Alexander George Gray, a bankrupt. There was a large attendance of manufacturers and professional men. The works stand on fifteen acres of ground, and were held under a lease of ninety years from the Master and Brethren of St. James's Hospital, at an annual rent of \u00a3300. One of the conditions was, that the purchaser should take the material then in the works at a valuation. Mr. Brown, of the Gateshead Iron Works, bid \u00a36,000, simply to dis mantle the place for the sake of the material. Several other offers were made, until the bidding reached \u00a312,100, after which the auctioneer announced the reserved bid was \u00a314,000. Mr. William son, of Jarrow Alkali Works, immediately bid \u00a314,050, and no advance being offered, the works were knocked down to him at that sum. May 30. \u2014 A melee took place at St. Anthony's, between a number of Orangemen and Roman Catholics, which resulted in the death of a young Irishman, named John Cain. The deceased and some of his friends, all of them Roman Catholics, were pro ceeding homewards towards St. Anthony's, there being at that time about a dozen of them going in the same direction. On arriving at a public house, called the Ellison's Arms, a fight took place between a group of Oragemen, standing at the door, and the deceased's friends. Whether the quarrel had been induced in consequence of irritating language used on either side, or whether the attack was premeditated it is impossible to say, but in the struggle which ensued, a knife and other formidable instruments were used, both in offence and defence, and the unfortunate young man received injuries which caused his death in a few minutes. A great number of Orangemen were subsequently apprehended, and charged with being concerned with causing Cain's death. Of these only"], [349, "A.D. 1858.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 343 five, named Joseph Johnson, Richard Sayers, John Sloan, Andrew Bertram, and James Cameron, were put on their trial. The case came before Mr. Baron Martin, at the ensuing Summer Assizes, when Johnson, Bertram, and Cameron were acquitted. Sloan and Sayers were found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment each. 1858 (June 8). \u2014 A most horrifying scene was witnessed this even ing, in the Market-place, South Shields A sailor, named Thomas Cook, a steady and industrious man, had come into port from a voyage to Hamburgh, in the Castle Eden, and it was supposed that his brain had been effected by the extreme heat that had prevailed on the continent. After tea he had gone out for a walk, and almost immediately afterwards he was seen to rush up the spouting of St. Hilda's Church, like a cat, and work himself along the roofing on the east side of the large square tower. He stood with his feet upon a ledge, not above an inch in breadth, but digging his nails into the crevices he wrought himself in some marvellous manner to the west end ; the spectators expecting every moment that he would drop and be dashed to pieces. Having regained the church roof, he took his watch and dashed it against a stone, and then threw it among the shuddering crowd. He then pulled off his clothes, and, having torn them into frag ments pitched them among the awe stricken spectators, they anticipating that he would next leap down and be killed at their feet. He probably would have done so had not the police and a number of young men burst into the belfrey of the church and secured him. June 14. \u2014 Another of these terrible catastrophes, a boiler explosion, occurred this evening at Middlesborough. About six o'clock the steam had been got up in one of a couple of boilers connected with Messrs. Snowden and Hopkin's rolling mills, when suddenly the huge vessel burst with tremendous force, one portion, weighing about four tons, being driven a distance of sixty yards, dashing through sheds and workshops, and finally striking against the chimney stack of a forge, which it brought down. There were several persons in the place, all of which were thrown down and scalded, Solomon Wilds, the fireman, so severely that he died on the follewing morning ; and ten other persons were carried out of the place dreadfully excoriated and mutilated. June 16. \u2014 The venerable Sir Charles Ogle, bart., Admiral of the Fleet, died, after a short illness, at Tunbridge Wells, at the patriarchal age of four score years and three. This brave and distinguished officer was the descendant of a family of great antiquity in the county of Northumberland, his ancestors having been Lords of Ogle and Bothal at the time ofthe Roman Conquest. The lamented deceased succeeded his father, who was also Admiral of the Fleet, as second baronet iu 1816 Sir Charles was thrice married. By his first wife, a sister of Viscount Gage, he had a son, formerly in the army, who succeeded to the title and estates, and two daughters, the youngest of whom, Sophia, was married,"], [350, "344 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1858. in 1830, to the Rev. Edward Challoner Ogle, of Kirkley, North umberland. He had also a son by his second marriage, but no issue by his third. The venerable admiral took an active part in the promotion of the monument at Tynemouth, to the memory of his friend and companion in arms Cuthbert Lord Collingwood. The brave old admiral was the model of an English gentleman, and was highly regarded by all who knew him. 1858 (June 16/ \u2014 A race with four-oar skiff's took place on the Tyne this afternoon, between the four brothers Taylor and four of the Clasper family. The race was for \u00a350 aside, and the four oared championship of the Tyne. It excited immense interest among the sporting classes, and drew together a vast concourse of spectators, who crowded almost every available space on both banks of the river, from Tyne Bridge to Scotswood. the distance rowed in the race. A very fair start was effected, the Taylors being slightly ahead, but, although they contested the ground manfully, the Claspers gradually gained, took the lead a little above the Skinners' burn, kept it, and won an excellent race by about two boat lengths. June 22. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day, and came off with their usual success. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. G, Forster's b c Underhand (Basham), beating Hamlet, Pensioner, and eleven others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. Eastwood's br f Hesperithusa (Challoner), beating Satin stone, Night Ranger, and four others. June 28. \u2014 Their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Northum berland, accompanied by the Rev. L. S. Orde, visited the Feme Islands, to pay a visit to the venerable William Darling, the lighthouse-keeper, whose heroism, along with that of his lamented daughter, on the occasion of the wreck of the Forfarshire, will long be gratefully remembered. They were taken off by Mr. Robert Patterson, of Monk's House, in a coble, and returned to Monk's House in the evening. July 12. \u2014 A most distressing accident occurred at Monk wearmouth. The wife of Mr. J. C. Welford, residing in North Bridge-street, had been ironing in the kitchen, when a muslin dress she wore unfortunately caught fire, by a red hot iron falling upon her robe while stooping to put it in the ironing-box She immediately ran out to a grass plot in front of the house, with her clothes blazing around her. No one happened to be passing at the moment, and she rushed back into the house, but returned again outside the door, enveloped in flames. Her cries attracted several people, who followed her into the house, and, throwing a rug about her, the flames were extinguished. She was frightfully burnt, and her injuries resulted in death. The poor lady had only been three months married. July 22. \u2014 The great match between Harry Clasper, of Newcastle, and Campbell, the champion of Scotland, came off on the Clyde, for \u00a3100 a-side and the championship. Clasper pulled in a boat built by himself, said to be the finest model he had. ever produced. He was then in his 48th year, while his opponent had"], [351, "&frit$UL"], [352, ""], [353, ""], [354, "Cfrgt$UI."], [355, ""], [356, ""], [357, "A.D. 1858.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 345 the advantage of fifteen years on his side. A great deal of betting took place on the event, the odds being slightly in favour of Campbell. The race was a very hollow affair, Clasper taking the lead from the start and winning by 150 yards. 1858 (July 29/ \u2014 Great consternation was excited this morning in the neighbourhood of the Ouseburn, Newcastle, by a fearful boiler explosion at the works of Messrs. Morrison, boiler builders. The occurrence took place about half-past five o'clock, a little before the arrival of the work people. Some, however, were waiting, and suffered from the accident, but the injuries that resulted were propably nothing compared with what would have ensued had the whole force of the establishment been at work. The boiler, which was a new one, blew up with a concussion that shook the building to its foundation, and shot into the air, tearing away every impediment and descended about twenty yards to the south. James Fielding, Charles Colvin, James Pollock, Robert Adams, and Philip Weir were severely scalded and mutilated. Colvin and Fielding died on the following day. July 31. \u2014 This afternoon a lunatic, named John Hewitson, came to his death by leaping from the High Level Bridge. The poor man was a single person, aged 25, and was formerly clerk to Mr. Blagburn, tallow chandler, Gateshead. It appeared that he I had been sent out in charge of Rankin Duff, one of the attendants at Bensham Lunatic Asylum. They had delivered a message in High-street, Gateshead, and were crossing near the railway station in order to go up West-street, when Hewitson, suddenly gave Duff a blow on the chest which knocked him down, and then ran towards the High Level Bridge. Duff gave chase and called upon the people to stop him but Hewitson kept ahead, and, on reaching the bridge leapt over the railing and sell within the gateway in Pipewellgate, leading into Pringle's yard, and was killed on the spot. August 6. \u2014 A notorious fellow, named Robert Boyd, 22 years of age, who had been sentenced to six years' penal servitude by Mr. Baron Martin for being concerned in a garrotte robbery, effected his escape from Newcastle Gaol, in a most daring and clever manner. He had been lodged in a cell in one of the wings facing the governors' private residence, and, on the morning on which he made his escape, or on the night preceeding, he had succeeded in forcing from its place, by means of a cold chisel, a large metal pipe near the roof of his prison, thus making an aperture nine inches in breadth and fourteen inches in length through which he squeezed himself and got on to the roof. Having procured a number of rugs and knotted them to together, so as to form a stout rope, he passed from the top of the building to a gallery, from thence to another gallery immediately opposite to the governor's sleeping room, then to a gallery above, and having crossed a foot- bridge he then dropped to the ground. He then proceeded to the stone breaking yard, obtained a plank and two bags of teazed hair, with which to assist himself in escaping, and re-ascending tbe wall, vol in, V 1"], [358, "346 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D, 1858. by means of a plank, gained the spot he had just left. The wall, which he had ascended, is furnished with a cheveux de frize, upon this he placed the bags of hair to prevent it from revolving, and, having placed the plank upon it, he clambered up the wall and descended on the other side in Carliol-square. All these operations were performed at the most imminent hazard and risk of detection, but so cleverly were they executed that the escape was not dis covered untill three o'clock, when a policeman saw the rugs suspended from the gaol wall. Every effort was made for the discovery of the escaped prisoner, but all exertions were fruitless until three weeks afterwards, when Boyd was apprehended by two county police officers, after a desperate resistance, at the house of a relative in the neighbourhood of St. Anthony's. 1858 (August 7). \u2014 The foreman of the tinners at Messrs. Abbot and Co's. Iron Works, Gateshead, Mr. William Hailes, and four of his friends, named John Ryles, Thomas Warner, William Pitt, and William Ramshaw, set out in a little boat for a day's ramble at Tynemouth. All went on well until they arrived at Walker, when all of a sudden, and without any perceptible cause the boat capsized, and the five men were precipitated into the water. Three of them proved gi;od swimmers and reached the bank in safety, the other was picked up, but poor Hailes sank too rise no more. His body was found shortley after with his hands firmly clenched round one of the mooring chains. September 2. \u2014 The marrage of the Honourable Gustavus Hamilton Russel], the only son of Viscount and Viscountess Boyne, of Brancepeth Castle, in the county of Durham, with Lady Katherine Frances Scott, third daughter of the late, and sister of the present, Earl of Eldon, was solemnized at St. Peter's Church, Eaton- square, London. September 3. \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred to Frederick Dickens, esq., solicitor, of London, at Tynemouth Sands this morning. Mr. Dickens, who had just returned in good health and spirits from a tour in Switzerland, was down on a visit to his friends at Tynemouth, and was stopping with his cousin, William Hawks, esq. About eight o'clock he went out for the purpose of bathing, and engaged one of Linklater's machines at the Long Sands. The machine was taken into the sea to the usual depth \u2014 about three feet. Mr, Dickens, had, however been accustomed to dive in deeper water, and, without thinking of the shallowness, he plunged in and came in violent contact with the sand. Ee never rose again until he was lifted up by Mr. Linklater. Mr. Dickins was then removed to Mr. Hawk's house, and on an examination being made by two medical gentleman, Dr. Mathews and Dr. Featherstonhaugh, they found that the spine was fractured. The unfortunate gentleman died on the following morning. He was only 25 years of age. September 7. \u2014 A most distressing gun accident occurred in Gateshead. A blacksmith, named Samuel Fearney, resident in the upper part of that borough, irritated by his apprentice having"], [359, "a.d. 1858.1 347 REMARKABLE EVENTS. stayed out too long shooting, threatened to break the gun, and he was suiting the action to the word by taking it by the muzzle and striking it against the anvil, when the gun went off and shot him in the groin, from the effects of which he died in a few hours. 1858 (September 14/ \u2014 The annual conference of the Northern Union of Mechanics' Institutes was held at Alnwick, under the presidency of Sir George Grey, bart.. M.P. A special train from Newcastle was arranged for the occasion, and at half-past nine in the morning a very numerous party left the Central Station for the place of meeting. At Alnwick all due preparations had been made by the committee, which was composed of Messrs. G. Tate, F.G.S., and Thomas Buddie, secretaries ; James Archbold, Henry Hunter, James Heatley, jun., Joseph Archbold, James Hall, Henry Hunter Blair, George Ormston, and William Richardson. On arrival at Alnwick the delegates from a distance were received by the Alnwick Committee, and conducted to the Town Hall, where the conference took place, and shortly after the hour of meeting \u2014 half-past eleven \u2014 there was a considerable gathering, among whom were Robert Ingham, esq., M P., Terrot Glover, esq., Mayor, Mr. G. Tate, and Mr, J. Hodgson, from South Shields; Mr, Thornton, Secretary of the Union ; Mr. Robert Wallace, Mr. A Carse, and Mr. Sinclair, &c, from Newcastle ; Mr. Joseph Cowen, jun., Stella House ; Mr. Reed and Mr. Moseley, from Blaydon ; Mr. Ridley, from Hexham ; Mr. Smith, from Winlaton ; Messrs.

To various other places the delegates and strangers were conducted by other members of the committee of the Alnwick Institute, and the interval between the breaking up of the conference and the annual dinner was thus spent in a most agreeable and instructive manner. October 1. \u2014 The death of James Losn, esq., barrister-at-law, took place this morning, at his residence in Clayton-street, Newcastle. The learned gentleman had been struck with paralysis a few weeks previous, from which he never recovered. He had been six years judge of the Newcastle and Northumberland County Court.

In the window were some dozens of watches, not one of which had been removed ; two nuggets of gold and a silver snuff box were also found undisturbed ; and in a drawer, which the thieves had never opened, were \u00a3170 worth of gold rings. A great deal of valuable property was also contained in a safe, which had not been attempted to be forced. November 4. \u2014 The presentation of a testimonial to the venerable and highly respected Dr. Brown, of Sunderland, took place in the Central Hall, John-street, in the presence of a number of ladies and gentlemen. The testimonial consisted of a purse, containing 900 sovereigns, and a massive silver inkstand, bearing the following inscription: \u2014 \"Presented, together with the sum of \u00a3900, to Joseph Brown, esq., M.D., J. P., &c, &c, by the inhabitants of Sunderland, as a mark of their esteem and respect for his eminent abilities as a scientific aud practical physician, a patriotic citizen, and an unwearied friend to the poor. \u2014 Homines ad deos nullah re proprius accidunt quam salutem homonibus dando.\" The presentation was made by the Rev. R. Skipsey, and the worthy doctor, in reply, gave expression to sentiments which were warmly applauded by all present.

December 1. \u2014 This day the extensive and beautiful Hagger stone estate, situated in North Northumberland, was sold by Mr. S. Donkin, at the Auction Mait, London. The proceedings excited great interest, and the rooms were crowded, many gentle men from the north being present, including Mr. Robertson, Ladykirk ; Mr. Henry Morton, Biddick ; Mr. George Burdon, Linden ; Mr. Giegson, Low Lynn ; Mr. Naylor, Liverpool ; Mr. A"], [361, "A.D. 1858.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 349 Philipson, Newcastle ; Mr. Thomas Mason, Pallinsburn ; Mr. Walter Johnson, Secretary of the Northumberland Agricultural Society ; Mr. George Rea, Middleton; Mr. William Forster, Alnwick; Mr. Thomas Crisp ; Mr. William Laurie ; Mr. Robert Walters, New castle ; and all seemed surprised when, at one blow of the hammer, the whole of that magnificent estate underwent a transfer to a new dynasty. The estate was put up at \u00a3340,000, when the first bid was made by Mr. Philipson, of Newcastle, for the Earl of Durham, at \u00a3300,000; Mr. Naylor, of Liverpool, following with an advance of \u00a35,000, which was immediately overstepped by the same sum, the biddings advancing \u00a3'5,000 till \u00a3338,000 was bid for Lord Dur ham, when Mr Naylor, the millionaire of Liverpool, put in \u00a3340,000 and was declared the purchaser. Mr. Donkin, on leaving the rostrum, received the cordial congratulations of a numerous party of friends upon his very successful debut in the Metropolitan Auction Mart. Mr. Naylor is one of three brothers who, by the death of an uncle, a Liverpool banker, Mr. Leyband, became possessed of four millions of money. 1858 (December 1&). \u2014 The Church of England Institute held its annual soiree in the New Town Hall, Newcastle, this evening. The hall had been tastefully decorated for the occasion, this being the first soiree held in that magnificent apartment. There was a very numerous brilliant company present, numbering upwards of a thousand ladies and gentlemen. The tables were supplied by the following ladies : \u2014 Mr . Mayoress, Miss Eobinson, Mrs. Moody Mrs. John Abbot, Mrs. George Armstrong, Miss Clayton, Mrs. Daglish, Miss Dobson, Mrs. Douglass, Mrs. R. East, Mrs. D. Embleton, Misses Gibb, Mrs. C. Gibson, Mrs. G. Grey, Mis. Hawthorn, Mrs. Blackwell, Mrs. D. Burn, Misses Clark, Mrs. Heriott, Mrs. Irvine, Mrs. Mills, Misses Sinclair, Mrs. Snape, Mrs. Spoor, Misses Wallace.

Shepherd, J. P. Muleaster, Alderman Blackwell, &c. The Sheriff opened the proceedings in an appropriate address, and called upon Mr. Forster, who read an able and highly interesting report, which gave a sketch of the history and objects ofthe institution. It appeared that the institute, along with an excellent reading room, stocked with newspapers, periodicals, and magazines, possessed a library, consisting of 900 volumes, selected in strict accordance with the fundamental object of the society \u2014 that of the diffusion of knowledge in subordination to Christianity. Classes for intellectual improvement had also been formed, all of which were being taught gratuitously. The pro ceedings were agreeably diversified by the St. Andrew's Church Choir, assisted by members of the institute. December 28. \u2014 A fearful boiler explosion occurred on the Hetton Railway, by which James Ford, the engineman, and his son, a boy ten years of age, were killed. Three others were blown a considerable distance, and severely mutilated."], [362, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. 350 1659 (January 25/ \u2014 This day the centenary of the birthday of the poet Burns, for which no small preparation had been making for some time previously, was celebrated in Newcastle with an extraordinary unanimity and enthusiasm. The day was ushered in by merry peals from St. Nicholas' Church bells, and there were no fewer than three distinct festive celebrations ; one in the New Town Hall, under the presidency of Sir John Fife ; another in the Music Hall, under the presidency of Mr. William Newton ; and the third in the Lecture Room, under the presidency of Mr. John Benson. In the New Town Hall a most respectable company of about four hundred sat down to an excellent dinner, provided by Messrs. Brinton and Son, of the Crown and Thistle Inn. The banquet included the Scottish national dish, a \" haggis,\" which had been got by Mr. Brinton from Edinburgh, and boiled in a pot which formerly belonged to Burns, but was bought by Dr. Murray, of Gateshead, at a sale of some relics of the poet a few years previous. Besides the \" Lords of the Creation,\" who feasted in the body of the hall, ladies were admitted to the side elevations and gallery after dinner to hear the speeches. On the right of the president were George Ridley, esq , M.P., Mr. M. L. Jobling, Dr. Greenhow, Mr. H. M. Greenhow, from Lucknow, and Dr. Mackintosh. On the left Mr. A. Nichol, Mr. S. Doukin, of Bywell, and Dr. Donkin, of Morpeth. Joseph Cowen, esq., occupied the vice-chair, and among the company were Councillors H. Parker, W. Weallens, R. Bolton Brown, B. Plummer, and George Hunter ; Messrs. P. G. Ellison, R. Hawthorn, J. T. Hoyle, B. Lawton, J. G. Grant, John Forster, Joseph Cowen, jun., J. C. Murray, Charles Brough, E. D.

Glenton, R. Glaholm, W- Burnup, G. Bradley, R. Renoldson, B. B. Black well, W. E. Franklin, &c, &c. After the usual toasts and several interesting speeches, the proceedings \u2014 throughout which the utmost harmony prevailed \u2014 were appropriately wound up with \" Auld Lang Syne.\" At the Music Hall and Lecture Room the same enthusiasm was manifested till the close. At the celebration in Edinburgh Colonel James Glencairn Burns, son of the poet, said \u2014 \" I humbly thank my God that he has spared me to live and see this glorious day \u2014 a day on which so many thousands, in almost every part of the globe, are paying homage to the genius ofthe Bard of Scotia. My mother told the late Mr. McDiarmid, of Dumfries, that my father once said to her, ' Jean, one hundred years hence they'll think mair o' me than they do now.' \" How truly his prophecy has been fulfilled the proceedings throughout the world on this day amply testified. January 30. \u2014 The extensive premises belonging to Messrs. Glaholm and Robson, in Hendon-road, Sunderland, used as a rope"], [363, "A.D. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 351 manufactory, were discovered to be on fire this morning. Large quantities of flax, hemp, tar, and other combustibles were soon enveloped in flames. The engine, engine-house, factory, roving and spinning machines, warping, winding, and twisting machines were all destroyed, and the walls, and all the substantial portions of the extensive buildings, were reduced to a mass of ruins. 1859 (February 10/ \u2014 A very disastrous fire took place on the premises of Mr. John C. Atkinson, timber merchant and saw mill proprietor, in Erick-street, Newcastle. The burning house was stocked with a large quantity of timber, and being situated in the very centre of a dense population, the alarm in the immediate neighbourhood was great. Fortunately the fire engines were stationed in the adjoining premises, and, having obtained a good supply of water, the firemen succeeded, by their well-directed efforts, in extinguishing the flames. The building, however, was completely gutted. The damage was estimated at \u00a3600. February 16. \u2014 About sixty of the workmen of the stained glass establishment of Mr. Wailes, Newcastle, were entertained to supper, at the White Hart Inn, on the occasion of Mr. William Wailes, jun., having attained his majority. Mr. J. Mein in the chair, supported on the right by Mr. William Wailes, jun., and Mr. Gamblen ; on the left by the Rev. R. Kirwood, of Hartlepool, and Mr. Strang ; Mr. H. Bullock acting as vice-chairman. After the usual loyal toasts had been given, the health of W. Wailes, esq., was drank in a warm and hearty style. The chairman then gave the toast of the evening, namely, the health of Mr. William Wailes, jun., which was received with great enthusiasm and acknowledged by that gentleman in suitable terms. The rest of the evening was spent in toasts, songs, and sentiments. February 16. \u2014 This morning the wind, which had been somewhat boisterous during the night, commenced to blow a tremendous gale, impeding all kinds of locomotion in the streets. damaging the wires of the electric telegraph, and in several instances occasioning personal injury to soot passengers. About two o'clock, when the gale was at its height, a small boat, containing four men, was swamped on the river Tyne, near St. Lawrence, two of whom were drowned. A great deal of damage was done to property in various parts of Newcastle. At Shields the gale was severely felt. Some old walls opposite Sunderland Church, known as the \"Magpie,\" were blown down as some children were passing from school, burying a boy and a girl in the debris. No time was lost in removing the rubbish, when it was found the boy was killed, his head being nearly flattened. The girl was only slightly injured. February 17. \u2014 A pig was slaughtered by Mr. Adam Patrick, butcher, Alnwick, which weighed 59 stones. It was bought of Mr. Robinson, Bolton Mill, near Alnwick. February 24. \u2014 Sir Benjamin Hawes, Under-Secretary for War, accompanied by Sir William Armstrong, of the Elswick Ordnance Works, visited Woolwich Arsenal this morning, and transacted"], [364, "352 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. business with Colonel Tulloch, Superintendent of the Royal Carriage Department. They were received within the arsenal gates by Colonel Wilmot, Superintendent of the Gun Factories, Captain Gordon, principal military store keeper, and Mr. John Anderson, inspector of machinery. One of the extraordinary breach-loading weapons invented by Sir William Armstrong, a 12-pounder, was brought out on Woolwich Common, for driving and firing practice by a detachment of Royal Horse Artillery. The most stringest orders were issued to prevent the near approach of civilians, or any examinations of the piece by strangers. During the sew days the gun remained in store at the arsenal even the officers of the estab lishment were refused permission to inspect it. A gentleman who was detected taking a pencil sketch of the gun was immediately arrested and called upon to forfeit his unfinished pioduction, which he most reluctantly yielded up to an officer present. 1859 (February 28). \u2014 The inhabitants of Newcastle and neighbour hood were naturally proud ofthe honour done to their distinguished fellow townsman, Sir William George Armstrong, by her Majesty conferring the honour of knighthood upon him, and appointing him Engineer to the War Department of Rifled Ordnance ; and, it having become known that on the above day he would pay his first visit, since his elevation, to the works at Elswick, great preparations were made to give him a cordial reception. The shops and offices were decorated with flags and streamers ; the workmen and their wives and families came out in holiday attire ; and a row of cannon was planted on an elevation facing the river. Sir William, accompanied by his lady, arrived at the gates of the factory in his carriage, at three o'clock, and was saluted with loud and prolonged acclamations and a feu de joie of welcome. Alighting he was conducted to a platform, where a highly congratulatory address was read by Mr. Hutchinson, the manager of the works, to which Sir William responded in a suitable manner, and thanked them cordially for the warm reception they had given him, and assured them that it would be his study, as their employer, to add as far as he could to their comforts ; and he trusted the same cordiality which had marked their intercourse hitherto, would continue, so that they might labour in harmony and good feeling. The assembly then dispersed. March 3. \u2014 The official opening of that stupendous under taking \u2014 the Jarrow Docks \u2014 took place this afternoon, on a scale of magnificence and splendour which has seldom, if ever, been witnessed on either side of the Tyne. Precisely at a quarter-past twelve a special train, for the conveyance of those gentlemen who had to take part in the ceremony, left the Central Station, at Newcastle. Amongst the passengers were the Eight Hon. Lord Ravensworth, the Right Hon. the Earl of Carlisle, Sir William George Armstrong, the Mayor of Newcastle (Joseph Laycock, esq.), the Mayor of Gateshead (W. Brown, esq.), the Chairman and Directois of the North-Eastern Railway Company, and several of the shareholders and their friends. On the train approaching its"], [365, "A.D. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 353 destination the vessels at anchor in the river presented an unusually gay appearance, displaying a profusion of flags from the bulwark to the main truck. On the arrival of the train at the high station the company formed in procession, led by the Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth and the Right Hon. the Earl of Carlisle, and proceeded in that order down to the jetty of the docks, headed by the splendid band ofthe Rifle Brigade, then stationed at the Newcastle Barracks, which played the familiar local air \" The Keel Row.\" On arriving at the jetty the Vanguard steamer was in readiness to receive the gentlemen who formed the procession. In addition to the noble lords on board the Vanguard the following directors were also present: \u2014 W. C. Copperthwaite, esq., of Malton; George Dods- worth, esq., Clifton, York ; James Hartley, esq., Sunderland ; W. R. Hunter, esq., Newcastle; James Kitson, esq, Leeds; C. G. Maclea, esq., Leeds ; N. Plews, esq , Darlington ; James Pulliene, esq., Bedale ; C. H. Seymour, esq., York ; W. L. Wharton, esq., Dryburn ; R. Williamson, esq., Scarborough; Amongst the general company were G. J. Fenwick, esq., William Woods, esq., William Hunter, esq., Thomas Bourne, esq., William Weallens, esq., Christian Allhusen, esq., T. E. Harrison, esq., A. C. Sheriff, esq., John Cleghorn, esq., Hedworth Williamson, esq., John Hope, esq., Edmund Crawshay, esq , T. C. Meek, esq., C. Bramwell, esq , Gibson Kyle, esq., R. W. Henley, esq., Captain Herd, R.N., R. Hodgson, esq , W. Hunter, esq., Thomas Young, esq., J. Straker, esq., A. C. Stevenson, esq., John Jobling, esq., H. T. Meynell, esq., <fcc., &c. On entering the dock the procession was welcomed by a salute of sixteen guns, which was fired in rapid succession, amidst the cheers of thousands of spectators, who covered every available spot where a view could be obtained. After sailing round and surveying the entire docks, the steamers returned to the jetty, and disembarked their passengers, who proceeded to inspect the various works and enormous capabilities of this gigantic undertaking, all the arrangements of which had been most admirably carried out, according to designs, by T. E. Harrison, esq., the engineer of the company, under the personal inspection of Robert Hodgson, esq., OE. With a view to give the coals abundant and rapid access to the docks, five substantial viaducts span the old road at the south-east bend of the slake, and connect the various lines of the North-Eastern Railway with so many means of access to the dock, where the coal waggons are run on to a stupendous suite of jetties, in the construction of which upwards of 400,000 feet of timber had been employed : there being four jetties extending considerably into the dock, each having a shipping spout at the end and four at each side, so that thirty-six vessels can be in process of loading at the same time. The standage for waggons is equal to twenty-five miles of railway, and with these combined facilities from 12,000 to 15,000 tons may be shipped in a day. In the evening a numerous and influential party of the shareholders and gentry of the neighbourhood cele brated the opening by a sumptuous banquet at Mr. T. B. Jeffrey's, VOl.

Thompson presided, and Mr. Leeman occupied the vice-chair. 1859 (March 10^) \u2014 Lord Lovaine having been appointed to another office under Government, was this day declared re-elected for North Northumberland. March 15. \u2014 A most appalling catastrophe occurred this day in North Shields. The Waterworks Company had arranged for a supply of water from a spring in South Preston New Pit, and Mr. Robert Wilson, foreman to Messrs. Heppell and Landells, engine builders, and Mr. Procter, foreman to the waterworks, descended the pit, in a cage, to arrange about the requisite machinery for pumping the water. John HerJman, the banksman, had forgotten that the cage had gone down, and, while talking to some cartmen, pushed a tub to the top of the shaft. He then saw the cage was not there, and tried to prevent the tub from falling into the pit, but it overmastered him, and they were both precipitated to the bottom. They fell upon Mr. Wilson, and killed him on the spot. The tub also struck Mr. Procter, breaking his thighs, and otherwise seriously injuring him. Herdman's back was broken by the fall, and he died a few days afterwards. March 25, \u2014 A serious fire took place at the Snab Leazes, a farm in the occupation of Mr. James Patterson, of the Plough Inn, Alnwick. The total amount of damage was not known, but all the stacks of corn (sixteen in number) were entirely consumed. Mr. Patterson, was uninsured. April 7. \u2014 An event of a most painful and distressing nature occurred at Ryton this morning. It appeared that the deceased, Mr. Henry Leonard Belt, the youngest son of Mr. George Belt, of the Groat-market, Newcastle, had, in company with a relative, left his uncle's house, at Ryton for the purpose of bathing in the Tyne, and when Mr. Belt's companion was undressing he heard a shout from the deceased, and, on looking round, observed nothing but his hands above water, when he instantly disappeared. A fishing boat having been procured, every effort was made to discover the body, which proved unsuccessful for fully two hours. When recovered life was of course quite extinct. It was supposed that the deceased, who was an excellent siwmmer, had taken a fit. He was nineteen years of age, and had been employed iu the office of Messrs. Joseph Heald and Co., Quayside, Newcastle. He was a young man of considerable ability and of great promise. April 18. \u2014 A boat race, which for some time past had excited considerable interest, came off this afternoon. The competitors were Robert Chambers, of Newcastle, and Thomas White, of Bermondsey, London. The stakes were for \u00a3100 a-side and the honour of the championship of England. The distance was from the High Level Bridge to Scotswood Bridge. Chambers, after being fouled twice, won the race by upwards of 100 yards. The winner was hailed as the Champion of England by an immense crowd assembled at the Suspension Bridge, and, as the steamers"], [367, "A.D. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 355 camp up, the cry was again and again renewed. This was one of the greatest triumphs that had ever been achieved in boat racing, and the Tynesiders had reason to be proud of their champion. 1859 (April). \u2014 Owing to an adverse vote on the Government Reform Measure, Parliament was dissolved, and the following was the result of the elections in this district : \u2014 BERWICK.

Above three hundred gentlemen assembled to do honour to the worthy knight. June 7. \u2014 Mr. Charles Wilson Bragg, only son of Mr. Charles Bragg, draper, Pilgrim-street, Newcastle, met with his death under very painful circumstances this morning. It appeared that Mr. Bragg lived at Lintzford, a few miles west of Newcastle, and at that place there is a large mill dam, which is often bathed in by the residents of the neighbourhood. Mr. Bragg having gone to the place to bathe, was shortly after seen by some men struggling in the water as if out of his depth. A number of persons were soon on the spot, and rendered every assistance, but all was in vain, he sank and never rose again. The body was not discovered until an hour afterwards. June 24. \u2014 A number of ladies and gentlemen, belonging to North and South Shields and neighbourhood, visited Marsden upon a scientific excursion this afternoon.

Brown, Horatio Adamson, and F. R. N. Haswell, members of the Naturalists' Field Club. The party visited the Trow Rocks, the extensive and curious caves at Manhaven, and other objects of interest along the coast. After tea at Mrs. Allan's, the party adjourned to tbe Velvet Beds, a beautifully detached rock, and,"], [369, "AD. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 357 while reclining on the turf, listened to a deeply interesting address from the Rev. G. C. Abbs, of Cleadon House, on the geology of the coast, the lecturer pointing out many interesting circumstances in connection with the magnesian limestone, and the great basaltic dykes of the Northern Counties, the latter apparently radiating from the extinct volcanic centre of the High Force, and Cauldron Snout, in Teesdale. The party broke up after having spent a highly instructive and pleasing afternoon. 1859 (June 2 7/ \u2014 A most distressing occurrence took place on board the barque Malcolm, Captain Natt, Newcastle, lying off Cookson's Quay, South Shields. The vessel being infested with rats, it was deemed advisable to have it stoved, consequently charcoal fires were lighted in the hold, strict orders being given that the crew were to sleep in the house on deck. However, four of the crew, named James Laing, James Prophet, Henry Jones, and William Wright, with a crowbrow, wrenched the forecastle hatch oft', and went below to sleep. In the morning Laing and Prophet were found dead, and the other two appeared to be dying. Dr. Coward was in attendance, and applied the usual remedies to Jones aud Wright, but the latter expired on the following day. June 28 \u2014 Owing to Mr. Headlam having accepted the office of Judge Advocate, an election of a member to represent Newcastle took place. Mr. Headlam was proposed by Mr. T. E.

The Newcastle and North British fire engines were quickly on the spot, and there being a plentiful supply of water, the flames were prevented from extending to the neigh bouring houses.

Wilson, esq., Associate of the Royal Institute of British Archi tects, Member of the Northern Architectual Association, Member of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, &c. : \u2014 \" In the green shade of a deep set valley on the banks of the river Coquet, Osbertus Colutarius built Brinkbum Priory.

BRINKBURN PRIORY. 1859 (July 12/ \u2014 The second great gun and rifle trial came off at Hornsey Wood House, near London, under the superintendence of the Editor of the \" Field,'' when Mr. Pape, of Newcastle, again distanced all competitors Last year Mr. Pape's guns headed the list as being superior to others in one or two qualities only, but on this occasion his gun figured at the top of the coloumn in every one of the characteristics which the trial was instituted to educe. July 19.\u2014 A great deal of excitement was created at Jarrow, this morning, in consequence of the discovery that a man, named John Shafto Wilthew, had murdered his wife by cutting her throat, and had attempted to commit suicide in a similar manner. Wiltbew was in the employment of Messrs. Palmer Brothers and Company, iron ship builders, as timekeeper, which situation he had held about five weeks. Previous to his employ ment at Messrs. Palmers he was storekeeper with Messrs. Leslie, iron ship builders, Hebburn. Deceased, who was fifty-one years of age, and had been married to her husband twenty-nine years, had borne"], [371, "a.d. 1859.] remarkable events. 359 him eleven children. She was a daughter of Mr. Anthony Charlton, Wellington-street, South Shields, and had been twice married. Wilthew, who was a native of Dunston, was tried and convicted of the murder before Baron Watson, and was executed at Durham on the Ilth of August following. 1859 (August 8). \u2014 A large congregation of the friends of Mr. Aid. Ingledew assembled in the vestry of St. Nicholas' Church, Newcastle, this afternoon, for the purpose of presenting that highly-e3teemed gentleman with a testimonial expressive of the sense entertained by the subscribers of his long and valuable labours for the public good, as an alderman of the borough, a churchwarden of the parish of St. Nicholas, and chairman of the Board of Guardians over a long course of years. The testimonial, manufactured by Mr. Thomas Sewell, silversmith, Newcastle, consisted of a handsome silver tea and coffee service and claret jug, value not less than \u00a3130, the salver bearing, with extreme accuracy, a representation of the famous steeple of St. Nicholas'. The company included the Rev. the Vicar, Sir John Fife, the churchwardens, aud a number of gentlemen connected with the parish or interested in the proceedings, besides a good many ladies, and to give eclat to the auspicious event, the bells of St. Nicholas' rang many a merry peal, which was only interrupted as the day came to a close. LUMLEY CASTLE. August 10 and 11. \u2014 The bazaar and grand fete on behalf of the new church at Lumley came of with more than ordinary success. The bazaar was opened in the entrance hall of the castle, which had been kindly granted by the Earl of Scarborough, and was appropriately decorated for the occasion. The stalls"], [372, "360 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. consisted chiefly of fancy work. The centre stall was presided over by Mrs. Dodd, assisted by Miss Young and Miss Carritch ; the second by Miss Ward and Miss Newmarch ; the third by Miss E. Dodd and Mrs. Mitchell ; the fourth by Miss Booth and Miss Corner ; and the fifth, designated the \" fairies' stall,\" was watched over by three pretty little girls, daughters of the Rev. J. Dodd, Mr. J. Crawford, aud Mr. M. Clark. A stall for refresh ments was most assiduously aud profitably attended to by Miss Arrowsmith and Miss Skelly. The principal contributors were the Countess of Scarborough, the Countess of Durham, Lady Georgina Grey, Lady F. Milner, Mrs. Shipperdson, Mrs. Dodd, Mrs. Craw ford, and Mrs. Robinson. The total proceeds of the two days were altogether about \u00a3200. 1859 (August 15). \u2014 A grand gala and balloon ascent took place at the Northumberland Cricket Ground, Northumberland-street, Newcastle, under the direction of Mr. Smith, lessee of the Victoria Rooms, which resulted in the death of Mr. Hall, the aeronaut. It appeared that he had made his descent with too great precipitance, near to Scots House, on the Suuderland-road. On reaching the ground the car was overturned, dislodging two bags of sand, as well as Mr. Hall, whose leg became entangled in the rope-work. In this critical position he was drawn upwards to the height of 120 feet, when he fell into a clover field, near to Scots House, the residence of H. L. Pattinson, esq., to which place he was removed on two sheaves of wheat, which served as a stretcher. Mr. Hall was afterwards removed to the Infirmary, where he lingered until the 18th. September 6. \u2014 The Alnwick Horticultural and Botanical Society held their seventh annual county show in the beautiful Abbey Grounds, which, since the commencement of the society, have been granted by the Duke of Northumberland for the purpose. The fame of the previous shows of the society, together with the access which is afforded to the sylvan walks and glades of the noble duke's grounds on the occasion, contributed, in addition to the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood, to bring special trains, loaded with visitors, from the towns on the banks of the Tyne and along the line of route from the south, as well as special trains from the north. The grounds during the day were crowded by a gay assemblage, who appeared to be highly gratified by their visit, and after they had inspected the floral and horticultural treat, enjoyed almost equally the promenade on the green sward or the retirement aud rest afforded under the umbrageous foliage of the woody retreats. September 11. \u2014 The chapel of St. Mary the Virgin was opened for divine service by the lately appointed Master, the Rev. Robert Anchor Thompson. This beautiful edifice, which is connected with the Hospital of St. Mary the Virgin, is most eligibly situated on a fine, open, salubrious space, immediately in front of Rye-hill, Newcastle, midway between Elswick-lane and Scotswood-road. The charity with which the chapel is connected originated, like"], [373, "A.D. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 361 many similar charities, at so remote a period, or the origin of it has been so obscurely handed down, that it cannot be traced clearly further back than the time of James the First, in whose reign it was reconstructed by royal charter. The objects of the charity may be described as threefold, viz., the maintenance of an hospital for the eleemosynary residence of the brethren, of a residence for the master, and of an establishment for the education of youth. To support these various objects a quantity of property, situated between the old Spital and the river, now occupied by the Central Railway Station, besides other properties situated in the townships of Jesmond and Fenham, appears to have been devised by the founder, and is still preserved, if not all, yet the most part, and greatly enhanced in value, to the purposes of the charity, the Spital (or hospital, for which the word is a contraction) Royal Grammer School, at which the sons of freemen had certain privileges in respect of education ; and from the fact of the property of the hospital commencing here and extending southwards, it may reasonably be presumed that here once stood both hospital and school-house, as well as chapel. In process of time the hospital seems to have disappeared, probably from not having been kept in proper repair ; and the brethren at one time were lodged in a wretched brick house, in the Pudding-chare. This state of things was rudely interfered with, in 1832, by an information being filed in the Court of Chancery, by the Attorney-General, on the certificate of the Charity Commissioners, against the Rev. Edward Moises, and the Corporation of Newcastle, defendants, alleging various abuses of the charity, amongst others \" that there was no building called or used as an hospital, or any residence for the master, but that the brethren lived in an incommodious and confined building, in a certain place called the Pudding-chare.\" The result of this suit was the passing of the Virgin Mary Hospital Estate Bill, which received the royal assent on the 26th of August, 1846. The erection of the chapel and almshouses was proceeded with, according to plans by the late Benjamin Green, superintended by his cousin, Mr. John Green, of Newcastle ; the clerk of the works being Mr. Leighton, and the contractors Messrs. Iveson, Bell, and Welton, by whom the designs have been most admirably carried out. The chapel overlooks the vale of the Tyne, and from the town its lofty spire may be seen tapering upwards to a point, apparently fragile, yet so strong as to have resisted the heaviest storm. The ground plan exhibits the cruciform ar- rangement of a nave, with side aisles and chancel, intersected by a transept. The extreme length is 123 feet, and the breadth from end to end of the transept 75. The walls ofthe aisles are relieved externally by a series of buttresses, and double buttresses support all the salient angles of the building. The tower, which is 25 feet square, rises from the intersection of the nave and transept, and is supported by four massive pillars in the interior of the building. It is finished above with a cornice, richly ornamented with trefoil mouldings, and is surmounted by the spire, which VOL III. T 1"], [374, "362 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. tapers beautifully upwards to an elevation of 177 feet 9 inches from the ground. The chapel contains accommodation for about five hundred persons, and fully that number assembled within its sacred walls. On the occasion the Mayor (Joseph Laycock, esq.), the Sheriff (Dr. Robinson), the Under-sheriff (John Clavering, esq.), the Town Cleik (John Clayton, esq.), and a number ofthe aldermen and councillors, assembled at the residence of the master, in Rye-hill, and thence walked in procession to the chapel. 1859 (September 19/ \u2014 Another balloon ascent took place this evening, and happily without the fatal termination of the last. Mr. Coxwell, editor of the \" Aerostic Magazine,\" was the aeronaut, who was accompanied in the ascent by Mr. J. B. Langley. The wind was W.N.W. with the evening fine, and the balloon floated in a south-easterly direction sor nearly half an hour, when a safe descent was effected in a field at West Bolden, not far distant from the place where the other fatal descent occurred. September 20. \u2014 One of the boilers at Kelloe Colliery, near Durham, exploded with tremendous force this afternoon, causing a great amount of damage, and involving the loss of three lives, besides seriously endangering several others. On the removal of the debris the dead bodies of the unfortunate men, named John Mavin and John Falshaw, were discovered in the fire holes, scalded and mutilated fearfully. A third man, named John Henderson, a mason, was so severely injured, by a large stone falling upon him, that he died shortly after. At the time of the explosion there were 250 men and boys in the pit, with whom all communi cation was cut off for hours, and it w-as not untill eleven o'clock at night that the machinery was so far restored as to enable them to be brought to bank. September 29. \u2014 This day the great skiff race for \u00a3400 came off on the Thames, between Robert Chambers, the champion of the Tyne, and Harry Kelley, the champion of the Thames. From the renown both men possessed a great race bad been anti cipated \u2014 a fierce, close contest the entire distance \u2014 instead of which the race might have been considered over the first three-quarters of a mile. They started at a quarter-past four precisely. After a few strokes Chambers began to draw a slight lead, and in the next minute it was marked and decisive, for before they reached the Craven Chambers had drawn himself clear, and presently took his opponent's water. A every stroke Chambers went further away from his man, and ultimately won by thirty boat lengths. Very large sums changed hands upon the event. A great many gentlemen from the North had gone to town to back Chambers, and were well repaid for the expense and trouble of their visit. September 30. \u2014 This day the Right Rev. Dr. Longley, Lord Bishop of Durham, consecrated St. Paul's Church, High Elswick, Newcastle, in the presence of a numerous and respectable congregation. Thia spacious and elegant structure stands on an eligible open space, a little to the north of Elswick-lane, opposite"], [375, "a.d. 1859.J remarkable events. 363 the head of West-parade, and is designed in the most simple form of Gothic architecture, and is on that account, in the estimation of many, all the more chaste in its exterior, while it would nut be easy to name a church which partakes more of the appropriate simplicity and quiet elegance which befit a place of worship, or one more calculated to inspire a devotional feeling. 1859 (October 3/ \u2014 A melancholy circumstance occurred at Craster South Side, near Alnwick. It appeared that Mr. Henry Purvis, of Alnwick, Mr. George Bolam, of Ratscheugh, and Mr. David Hope, proprietor of the Broomhill Tile and Brick Works, proceeded to Craster South Side to shoot rabbits, and, during the sport, Mr. Purvis's gun went off by accident and shot Mr. Hope in the ankle, shattering the bone. Surgical aid was immediately sent for, but the patient never rallied, and died about half-past four the same afternoon. Deceased was largely engaged in business dealings with gentlemen of the neighbourhood, and was universally esteemed for his many estimable qualities. October 4. \u2014 A robbery of a most daring and singular description was again committed in the shop of Mr. R. Thompson, watch maker and jeweller, situated in the Royal Arcade. Newcastle. Scarcely had twelve months elapsed since the same premises were broken into, and property of considerable value carried away ; that event, strange to relate, having also occurred in the month of October in the previous year, and under circumstances in many respects similar to the piesent occasion. October 6. \u2014 The good old custom of celebrating the ingathering of the harvest is nowhere more respected than at His Grace the Duke of Northumberland's Home Farm, under the direction and presidency of Mr. Patten. The fete came off this evening. The large granaries were all cleared out for the occasion, and tastefully decorated with such a profusion of laurels and evergreens that one almost seemed to be dining beneath embowering trees in the wild woodland. In the larger apartment, above the chairman's seat, was the Percy crescent, formed of laurels and flowers, and at the other end a sheaf of corn, with a reaping hook stuck into it, and beneath the words, \" Speed the Plough,\" skilfully and tastefully arranged in flowers and evergreens by Miss Patten. The tables literally bent beneath their burdens of sirloins of beef, legs of mutton, flagons of Ale, &c. After the dishes were removed the chairman gave the usual loyal toasts, and it is needless to say that the healths of their graces were received with the most unbounded enthusiasm. October 12. \u2014 Died, in London, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, Robert Stephenson, esq., the eminent engineer and locomotive manufacturer. His loss was regarded as a national bereavement, and the expression of regret was universal. Soon after the close of the preceding session Mr. Stephenson was in indifferent health, and, during a visit which he soon afterwards paid to Norway, he was attacked with a complaint of the liver. Whilst returning to England he was attacked with jaundice, and on"], [376, "364 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1859. landing at Lowestoft it was necessary to carry him to the railway carriage. Dropsy set in on his arrival in town, and he was too weak to be relieved, and, after a few days' illness, he expired com paratively free from pain. Mr. Stephenson was born at Willington, near Newcastle, on December 16, 1803. His father, who had felt the want of early education, resolved that his son should not suffer from the same cause, and accordingly sent him to a school at Long BentoD, and 1814 placed him with Mr. Bruce, in Percy street, Newcastle. Robert soon displayed a decided inclination for mechanics ard science, and becoming a member of tho Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society was enabled to take advantage of its library. It 1818 Robert was taken from school, and apprenticed to Mr. Nicholas Wood as a coal viewer, and was made thoroughly acquainted with the machinery and processes of coal mining. In 1820 he was sent to Edinburgh University for a single session, where he attended the lectures of Dr. Hope on chemistry ; those of Sir John Leslie on natural philosophy ; and those of Professor Jamieson on geology and mineralogy. In 1822 he was apprenticed to his father, who had then commenced his locomotive manufactory at Newcastle. After two years' strict attention to the business, finding his health failing, he accepted a commission to examine the gold and silver mines of South America, whence he was recalled by his father, when the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was in progress, and he reached home in 1827. He took an active part in the discussion as to the use of locomotives on the line, and, in conjunction with Mr. Joseph Locke, wrote an able pamphlet on the subject. His next employment was the execution of a branch from the Liverpool and Manchester, near Warrington, now forming a portion of the Grand Junction Railway, between Birmingham and Liverpool. Before this branch was completed he undertook the survey, and afterwards the construction, of the Leicester and Swanninton Railway; and on the completion of that work he commenced the survey of the line of the London and Birmingham Railway, of which he was ultimately appointed engineer, and removed to London. Undei his direction the first sod was cut at Chalk Farm on June lst, 1834, and the line was opened September 15, 1838. He still continued to devote much of his time to improvements in the locomotive engine, which were, from time to time, carried out under his direction at the manufactory in Newcastle. His engagements on different lines of railway had been very numerous, but he was more remarkable for the magnifi cent conception and the vastness of some of his successfully executed projects, such as the Eigh Level Bridge, the Viaduct at Berwick \u2014 supposed to be the largest in the world, the Tubular Bridge over the Conway, at the castle, and the Britannia Tubular Bridge over the Menai Straits \u2014 a form of bridge of which there had been previously no example, and to which, considering its length and the enormous weight it would have to sustain, the obj ections and difficulties seemed almost insuperable. Mr. Stephenson was also employed in the construction of many foreign railways."], [377, "A.D. 1859.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 365 He was consulted, with his father, as to the Belgium lines ; also for a line in Norway, between Christiana and Lake Miosen, for which he received the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olaf from the King of Sweden ; and also for one between Florence and Leghorn, about sixty miles in length. He designed the Victoria Tubular Bridge over the S. Lawrence, near Montreal (on the model of that over the Menai Straits), in connection with the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, sor uniting Canada West with the Western States of the United States of America. He had recently completed the railway between Alexandria and Cairo, a distance of 150 miles. He also built an immense bridge across the Nile at Kaffoe Azzayat, to replace the steam ferry. In addition to his railway labours Mr. Stephenson took a general interest in public affairs, and especially in scientific investigations. In 1857 he was returned as a member of Parliament in the Conservative interest, for Whitby, in Yorkshire, for which place he continued to sit until his death. He was an honorary but an active member of the London Sanitary Commission, a Fellow of the Royal Society, a member of the Institution of Civil Fngineers, of which institution he was vice-president and president. In 1857 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the students. He received a great gold medal of honour from the French Exposition d'lndustrie of 1855. Mr. Stephenson married, in 1829, Frances, daughter of John Sanderson, Esq., of London, who died without issue in 1842. The deceased was interred in Westmister Abbey, on the 21st, between the tombs of George Telsord, the constructor of the Suspension Bridge over the Menai Straits, and Dr. Bell, the sounder of the Madras system of teaching. The Abbey was crowded by scientific and eminent men from all parts of the kingdom. In Newcastle all the shops suspended business, and the workmen belonging to the manufactory attended St. Nicholas' Church in a body, when an appropriate sermon was preached by the Vicar. Mr Stephenson left the bulk of his fortune to his cousin, Mr George Robert Stephenson, and amongst the many bequests which he made were the following : \u2014 To the Newcastle Infirmary, ten thousand pounds ; to the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, seven thousand pounds ; to the Institute of Civil Engineers, two thousand pounds ; to the Curates' Aid Society, two thousand pounds ; and to other charities sour thousand pounds. The following letter, sent by His Highness Mohammed Said, Pasha of Egypt, on hearing of Mr. Stephenson's illness, is an illustration of the respect in which deceased was held by foreigners : \u2014 Cairo, 17th October, 1859. My Dear Mr. Stephenson, I have just learned from Mr. Hugh Tboburn that some time ago yon had been attacked with illness, and I cannot allow this mail to leave without telling you how much I have been affected by that distressing intelligence. I would fain believe that, instead of considering the present letter as an expression of mere politeness yon will recognise therein a proof of the attachment I feel towards you, and of the high esteem which 1 have always professed for the worth of your character and for your exalted talents. I"], [378, "366 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. also hope you will be good enough to honour me with a word of reply as soon as the improvement of your health will admit of your doing so. Accept my dear Mr. Stephenson, my sincere wishes for the preservation of your life, which is. not loss valuable to our country than to your own, and receive the assurance of my most affectionate regard. MOHAMMED SAID, 1859 (October 15/ \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred at Aln mouth, to the Rev. Edward Bryan, curate of St. Paul's Church, Alnwick, while bathing, by which the respected and unfortunate gentleman lost his life. Having been slightly indisposed for a few days, he set out for Alnmouth to bathe, as a likely means of relief. He intended to go by the three o'clock train from Alnwick to Bilton, but the train having started, he set out to walk. On the way he was overtaken by His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, at whose invitation he took a seat in the carriage, and was driven to Foxton Hall. His grace, on hearing that he was unwell, endeavoured to dissuade him from bathing, but Mr. Bryan adhered to his purpose, and on arriving at the beach went into the sea. Unfortunately, either by the strength of the waves, or being over taken by cramp, or some other cause, he got beyond his depths and was drowned. The sad event created a painful sensation in Alnwick, where the deceased, by his able and devoted ministra tions and amiable manners, had won universal esteem. In Newcastle also, where he was for some time curate of St. Andrew's, the calamity was much felt. October 20. \u2014 The interesting ceremony of laying the foundation stone of the Clayton Memorial Church, Newcastle, took place this day. The new church stands on the north side of the Jesmond Cemetery-road, the end of Carlton-terrace forming the western, and a new crescent forming the eastern, boundry. At twelve o'clock a large and influential concourse of spectators had assembled ready to receive the Lord Bishop of the diocese. His lordship, accompanied by his chaplain, the Rev. J. R. Hall, rector of Boldon, the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle (Jos. Laycock, esq.), the Sheriff (George Robinson, esq., M D.), the Town Clerk (John Clayton, esq,), arrived, followed by a numerous body of the clergy of the town and neighbourhood, together with the committee of the new church and other gentlemen, in procession, amongst whom were T E. Headlam, esq., M.P., George Ridley, esq., M.P., the Rev. the Vicar, Revs. H. W. Wright, R. Shepherd, R. East, C. A. Raines, G. Heriot, R. Short, R. Shepherd, jun., B. Addison, H. B.

The benediction concluded the proceedings, and the Bishop proceeded to Sandysord House, tho residence of Joseph S. Arnison, esq., and partook of luncheon. In the evening a monstre soiree took place in the New Town Hall to celebrate the event. 1859 (October 25;.\u2014 The inauguration of the New Town Hall organ was commenced, in the presence of the Mayor and members of the Town Council, the members for the borough, and other civic authorities. The instrument was built by Messrs. Gray and Davison, of London, and has a rich decorated front, which gives a look of completeness to the interior of the building, which it previously lacked. The celebrated organist, Mr. W. F. Best, presided on the occasion, and the vocalists who appeared on the platform were Miss Catherine Hayes, Madame Lemmens Sherrington, Miss Lascelles, Miss Topham, Mr. George Benson, and Mr. Lawler. The morning concert was of a miscellaneous character, that of the evening consisted chiefly of selections from the oratorio of the Messiah, and both were very successful. November 9. \u2014 The following gentlemen were elected chief magistrates of the towns in this district: \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Aid. Blackwell, esq., mayor; R. Hawthorn, esq., sheriff.

November 29. \u2014 The consecration of that noble, chaste, and beautiful edifice, St. Mary' Chapel, Rye-hill, Newcastle, was officially performed by the Lord Bishop of Durham this morning. The Bishop, accompanied by his chaplain, the Rev. J. R. Hall, rector of Boldon, together with several of the clergy of the town and neighbourhood, met at the residence of the Master of the Hospital of St. Mary the Virgin, the Rev. R, Anchor Thompson, and walked in the following order to the chapel : \u2014 The Bishop and clergy in their ecclesiastical robes, and the Mayor, Sheriff and Under- Sheriff in their official vestments.

As the"], [380, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1859. 368 procession advanced towards the sacred edifice it presented a most solemn and imposing aspect. On arriving at the door of tbe chapel, the Bishop was presented with the petition by the Master and Brethren of St. Mary's Hospital, for the consecration of the building. After the reading of the petition the Eishop declared himself ready to consecrate the chapel. After several prayers had been offered up, such as appertain to the consecration service, the Bishop then being seated, the Commissary read the sentence of consecration, after which his lordship duly signed and promulged the same, and commanded it, together with the petition and deed, to be registered among the muniments of the diocese. 1859 (December 8/ \u2014 This day the laying of tbe foundation-stone of Christ Church, Shieldfield, Newcastle, took place about noon, and was performed by the Venerable Archdeacon Thorp, accom panied and assisted by the Mayor (J. Blackwell, esq ), the Sheriff (W. Hawthorn, esq ), the Rev. Mr. Boyd, Rector of Arncliffe, the Vicar of Newcastle, the Incumbent of Ali Saints, and a number of the clergy of the town and neighbourhood, and the gentlemen connected with the district, there being also a large concourse present to witness the proceedings. The ceremony commenced by the Rev. W. Irvine, incumbent of the parish, offering up an appropriate prayer, after which the Venerable Archdeacon read the scripture service, the company making the responses. An hermetically sealed bottle, containing several coins and copies of the \" Journal\" and \"Express,\" were then deposited in a cavity in the stone, together with a roll containing the following inscription, which was read by Mr. J. J. Hunter, one of the secretaries : \u2014 CHRIST CHURCH, SHIELDFIELD, NEWCASTLE-r/PON-TTNE. The foundation-stone of this church, which is to be erected to the glory of God, was laid, in the name of the Holy, Blessed, and Glorious Trinity, on the eighth day of December, eighteen hundred and fifty-nine, by the Venerable Charles Thorp, Doctor of Divinity, Archdeacon of Durham, and Warden of the University of Durham. This church (to be called Christ Church) was built at the cost and expense of the family of the late William Boyd, esq., formerly banker of this tcwn (added, by grants, to the amonnt of \u00a3435 from public church societies), from a feeling of sympathy with the spiritual destitution of the large and overgrown parish of All Saints, w ith which their family had been long connected, and of which the Shieldfield district formed a part. The endowment was raised by contributions of the inhabitants of Newcastle-npon-Tyne and of others connected with this district. The following gentlemen formed the acting committee : \u2014 Chairman.

It appeared that Mrs. Charlton was unwell, and on being waited upon by the servant, called her attention to a smell of fire. In an instant her whole dress was in a blaze, and, rushing frantically from the room, portions of her burning dress were floating about in all directions. She ran into the garden, where her screams were heard by several of the neigh- bours. Mrs Charlton, ill as she was, got out of bed to procure assistance, and a number of servant girls in the neighbourhood came to the spot, but they seemed paralysed by the spectacle. Mr. Markham, dentist, who had been out shooting, was attracted by the screaming of the females. When he arrived the unfortunate women had got back into the kitchen, and was crouching down in a corner in such a state, that he could hardly believe that he saw a human being. He succeeded in extinguishing the fire, but the whole of the poor women's body was dreadfully burnt. Dr. Houseman, Mr. Brady, and Mr. Newton, surgeons, who happened to be in the neighbourhood, did all they could to alleviate her sufferings, and ordered her to be removed to the Infirmary. On the way she expressed a wish to be buried in St. Edmund's Churchyard, Gateshead. She arrived at the Infirmary about half- past four, aud died at ten minutes to six. The unfortunate woman was highly respected by her mistress. December 26. \u2014 A testimonial, consisting of an elegant gold French clock, a silver spirit stand and salver, together with a gold watch and chain (for Mrs. Southern), were presented to G. W. Southern, esq , on the occasion of his leaving his situation as viewer of the collieries belonging to J. Bowes, esq., and Partners, to undertake a similar one at the collieries of the Marchioness of Londonderry. The testimonial bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to George William Southern, esq., by the agents of Springwell, Kibblesworth, Mount Moor, and Shipcote Collieries, and other friends, as a token of the high respect and esteem in which he was held by them while viewer at the above-named collieries.

Although the deceased was a resident in the county of Durham, he had been closely identified, in its legal affairs, with Newcastle for many years, having been appointed Recorder in 1834, an office sustained by him for twenty years with the dignity befitting its ancient character; and in the year 1847 he was appointed Judge of the County Courts of Northumberland, which he held until compelled by declining health, in 1853, to resign. His recordership will be remembered by those who have heared his fine tone of voice, and have seen his tall figure robed at the Assizes, or on other official occasions. Mr. Wilkinson was called to the bar in 1814, and went the Northern Circuit, was iu the commission, and frequently presided as judge at Durham. His upright career brought him many active duties. He was selected by Lord Brougham as one of the commissioners for inquiring into the state of the Corporations in England and Wales. He was a Commis sioner in Bankruptcy for the Sunderland and Stockton districts, and for many years a revising barrister for Yorkshire and Lanca shire. He was also for some time chairman of the Great North of England, the Bishop Auc'.land and Weardale, and the Wear Valley Railways, and, in addition, was a magistrate for the county of Durham ; and in all the relations of life his straightforward and honourable career secured for him many warm friends. By his marriage he inherited the estate of Harperley Park, which then became the property of his eldest son, Rev. G. P. Wilkinson, of Helm Park. Deceased was buried at Witton-le-Wear on the 28th, there being a large attendance of the gentry of the neighbourhood present at the funeral. December 27. \u2014 Died, aged 62, the Right Hon. Jacob Astley, Lord Hastings, of Melton Constable, in the County of Norfolk, and of Seaton Delaval, in the county of Northumberland. The deceased, who, along with the Marquis of Waterford, was descended maternally from the Delavals, of Seaton Delaval and Ford Castle, in Northumberland, was married, in 1819, to Georgiana Caroline, daughter of Sir Henry Dashwood, bart., by whom he had Jacob Henry Delaval, born in 1822, an officer in the army, who succeeded to the title and estates; and Delaval Loftus, born in 1825, who married, in 1848, Frances Diana, daughter of Viscount Canterbury. The late Lord Hastings succeeded to the splendid mansion and extensive estates at Seaton Delaval on the death of his father, then Sir Jacob Astley, bart., who, in consequence of the demise of Edward Hussey Delaval, esq., the last male heir of the Delavals, without issue, inherited them in right of his mother, Rhoda, eldest daughter of Francis Blake Delaval, esq., of Seaton Delaval, and sister to Sir Francis Blake Delaval, K.B., and the late Lord Delaval. 1860 (January 2). \u2014 An interesting and exciting spectacle was witnessed at Ncwton-by-the-Sea, Northumberland. Joseph Forster, esq., of Newton Hall, in order to encourage ball practice, gave two"], [383, "A.D. 1860.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 371 prime pigs to be shot for by the villagers in that township. Fifty competitors entered the lists, among whom was Mrs. Rutter, the young wife of a fisherman of the place, which circumstance added much to the interest of the day's proceedings. The target was placed at a distance of eighty yards. The guns had smooth bores only, and were used without a rest. James Carse was declared the winner of the best pig. The competition for the other rested between William Kerr, Mrs. Rutter, and James Carse, jun., and the former ultimately obtained it. Although Mrs. Rutter was not successful in obtaining a prize, her performance was highly creditable. The quiet and graceful manner with which she handled her gun was a perfect lesson in the use of that weapon, and would have done credit to an experienced rifleman. 1 860 (January 3) \u2014 The Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth had been entertaining, at his magnificent and baronial castle, a distinguished party of visitors, among whom may be mentioned the Earl and Countess Vane, Viscount and Viscountess Boyne, the Hon. Gustavus Hamilton and Lady Katherine Russell, Lady Gertrude Scott, the Hon. Mrs. George Liddell, the Hon. Lady Williamson, the Hon. H. G. Liddell, M.P., and the Hon. Mrs. Liddell, Captain and Miss Longley, Miss Hare, the Rev. C. Cookesley, Mr. Hedworth Williamson, Captain Williamson, and Mr. Victor Williamson. The reunions thus formed were of the most brilliant and agreeable order, as might fully be expected from the hospitable and noble nature of his lordship, and the high character of the circle that surrounded him ; and this evening the festivities received their fitting climax by a grand ball, to which were invited a very numerous company of the gentry of Northumberland and Durham. January 31. \u2014 A grand vocal and instrumental concert, for some time announced to take place in Newcastle, and to which public expectation had been directed in an unusual degree, came off this day in the New Town Hall, and surpassed the most sanguine expectations as to performance, besides being most gratifying as to the numbers and character ofthe audience. Mr. Sims Reeves and Mdme. Clara Novello, with Miss Topham, sustained the vocal portion of the programme, with about sixty performers of the first celebrity in tbe metropolis, under the able conductorship of Mr. Horsley. For initiating and organising this great musical treat the public are indebted to our respected townsman, Mr. Hare, of Grey-street, whose spirit in entering on this enterprise was only equalled by the assiduity and completeness with which it was carried out. February 5.\u2014 A deplorable boat accident occurred in Shields Harbour this evening, by which three persons were drowned. It appeared that a steam-tug, the Harkaway, had towed a vessel over the bar, and on returning moored off Cookson's Quay, South Shields, after which a small cockle-shell of a boat was got out, aud eight of the crew entered it.

Immediately on the alarm beiug given instant steps were taken by those in authority to lessen, as far as possible, the effects of choke-damp. Mr. Kirkley, the fore-overman, descended the mine with a view to rescue those who might have escaped with their lives, in which praiseworthy aud humane effort he was happily successful, as several of the workmen and boys engaged on the Seghill division were brought to the surface alive, and, after the usual restoratives were applied, recovered from the effects of the choke-damp. Burradon Colliery, the scene of the calamity, was the property of Joshua Bower, esq., of Hunslet, near Leeds, who had only recently purchased it. A long aud searching inquiry took place as to the cause of the accident, but without any satisfactory result. March 6. \u2014 The annual meeting of the Mechanics' Institute, Newcastle, was held this evening, Mr. J. N. Fenwick in the chair. The secretary, Mr. McCullock, read the report, from which it appeared that the number of members had decreased , 8 during the year. The balance-sheet showed the society to be \u00a350 in debt. The report and treasurcrs's accounts having been adopted, Mr. Kilgour gave notice of a motion to convene a special general meeting, to consider the propriety of dissolving the institution. Mr W. Lockey Harle then addressed the meeting, approving of the suggestion to have the institution lawfully dissolved ; and expressed a hope that if the Corporation made the books the nucleus of a free library, that would be the resurrection of the society. The following were the officers elected for 1860 : \u2014 President \u2014 Sir John Fife ; vice-presidents \u2014 Sir George Grey, bart., M.P., G. Ridley, esq., M.P., T. E.

Robinson. March 27. \u2014A fatal boiler explosion occurred at the Shildon Pit, Blaydon Main, belonging to G. H. Ramsay, esq., of Derwent Villa, by which four lives were lost. Towards six o'clock in the morning, the hour for the night-shift coming off, Joseph Gray, the man in charge of the pumping-engine, on turning out to examine his boilers previous to going home, met William Holmes, the brakesman of the winding-machine, who had just come out for a similar purpose. Holmes tried the safety-valves and floats, pronounced them all right, and was turning away when the boiler"], [385, "A.D. 1860.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 373 exploded with tremendous force. The unfortunate Holmes was hurled to a distance of a hundred yards, aud killed on the spot. Daniel Johnson, a fireman, was blown about the same distance aud also killed. Gray was likewise carried off his feet a considerable distance, but, strange to relate, escaped with some scalds and bruises. William Huddard and John Laverick were crushed to death under the falling rubbish. 1860 (April 2). \u2014 A boiler explosion, of an even more serious character than that just recorded, occurred this morning, at Seaton Burn Colliery, situated on the Morpetb-road, about, six miles from Newcastle, and the property of Mr. Bowes and Partners, by which four men lost their lives, and several others were seriously mutilated. When it took place two stokers, named Robert Ewing and John Turner, were standing with the engineman. Younger, at the fire-hole, and all three were overwhelmed in the storm of rubbish. William Chevil, who was running small coals, received a blow on the head from a stone, and died the same evening. A great many others were struck by portions of the falling fragments and seriously injured. April 10 \u2014 The village of Cramlington was the scene of much gaiety and excitement on the occasion of the marriage of Dr. Bourne, of North Shields, with Miss E. F. Potter, third daughter of E. Potter, esq., mayor of Tynemouth. The youthful bride, accompanied by six bridesmaids, and a host of private friends, arrived at the church shortly after eleven o'clock, when the service was performed by the Rev. J. Smithard. After the marriage ceremony, the numerous guests partook of a very elegant and sumptuous dejeuner at Cramlington House, the residence of the mayor. During luncheon the excellent band of the Tynemouth Rifles was stationed on the lawn, and discoursed sweet music in their usual able manner. The festivities of the day were wound up by a dance, to the enlivening notes of Messrs. Hemy and Watson, at which both young and old enjoyed themselves heartily. April 16. \u2014 Died, at Woodsley House, near Leeds, the residence of his brother-in-law, Sir Peter Fairbairn, John James Brandling, esq., Lieutenant-Colonel Royal Artillery. This truly gallant officer obtained his commission in 1839. In 1847 he was directed to act on the commission, appointed by Government, in Ireland, for the relief of the distress occasioned by the famine, and for his services on that occasion he received the thanks of those in authority. In the Crimean campaign of 1854-5 he commanded a troop of Horse Artillery, and was present at the affairs of Bulganac and Mackenzie's Farm, at the battles of Alrna, Balaklava, and Inkermann, the capture of Balaklava, and the siege and fall of Sebastopol. For these distinguished services he received a medal and clasps, was made a C.B., a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and fifth class of the Medj'di. He was several times mentioned in despatches, being not more remarkable for gallantry in the field than for the thoughtful care bestowed on the men and horses under his charge. This much lamented and promising young officer was"], [386, "374 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D 1860. the third son of the late Robert William Brandling, esq., Low Gosforth, near Newcastle, and it is much less than the simple truth to say that he exhibited a character in which the more manly and the gentler qualities were combined ina manner eminently calculated to command respect and conciliate affection. 1860 (April 17^). \u2014 This evening the adjourned annual meeting of the St. John's Church Burial Board, Newcastle, was held for the election of officers, Mr. W. Owen in the chair, when Mr. John Burnup was unanimously re-appointed chairman of the Board for the ensuing year, and Mr. Thomas Wilson was re-elected vice chairman. The following were elected members of the com mittee : \u2014 St. John's \u2014 Messrs. Robinson, Fenwick, Mowbray, and Lumsden. Westgate\u2014 Messrs. Gallon, Harrison, Burrell, and Ainsley. Elswick \u2014 Messrs. Jobson, Hare, Storey, and Elliott. General purposes : \u2014 St. John's \u2014 Messrs. Pringle, Owen, Bradburn, and Hunter. Westgate \u2014 Messrs. Pace, Angus, Brown, Cowan, and Simpson. Mswick\u2014 Messrs. Curry, Stewart, Mack, and Bone. April 24, \u2014 This evening the general committee of the Mechanics' Institute met in the Reading Room, Blackett-street, Newcastle, Somerset Beaumont, esq., in the chair, when the secretaries reported that the following subscriptions had been pio mised towards paying off the debt : \u2014 Somerset Beaumont, esq., \u00a325; George Crawshay, esq., \u00a35 ; Mr. R. Wallace, \u00a35 ; and Mr. loseph Cowen, \u00a35. The chairman said that he had communicated with his brother, W. B. Beaumont, esq., M.P., and he had promised to subscribe \u00a325. The total amount of subscriptions would then amount to \u00a365, so that the old debt might be considered as discharged. A discussion on the general prospects and position of the institution ensued, after which it was unanimously agreed that the books should be at once re-catalogued, the rules revised, and the rooms cleaned and re-painted. The chairman generously undertook to get the books re-catalogued at his own expense, and the committee undertook to get the building cleaned and painted. April 27. \u2014 The \" London Gazette\" of this date contains the following announcemeut : \u2014 \"Her Majesty has been pleased to signify her intention to confer the distinction of the Victoria Cross on the under-mentioned gentleman, whose claim to the same has been submitted for her majesty's approval, on account of an act of bravery performed by him in India, as recorded against his name, George Bell Chicken, India Naval Brigade, for great gallantry on the 27th September, 1 858, at Suhejee, near Peroo, in having charged into the middle of a considerable number of rebels, who were preparing to rally and open fire upon the scattered pursuers. They were surrounded on all sides, but fighting desperately. Mr. Chicken succeeded in killing five before he was cut down himself. He would have been cut to pieces had not some of the men of the lst Bengal Police and 3rd Sikh Irregular Cavalry dashed into the crowd to his rescue, and routed it, after killing several ofthe enemy.\" Mr. Chicken is the son of Mr. George Chicken, shipowner, of Jarrow, and brother-in-law of Mr. James Hamilton, shipbroker,"], [387, "A.D. 1860.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 375 of Sunderland. Mr. Chicken, eleven years ago, before he had attained the age of twenty-one, passed a most successful exami nation, and sailed from England as chief officer in a large East Indiaman. He afterwards joined the Indian Navy, and soon became sailing master. When the mutiny broke out he joined Peel's Naval Brigade, and during the continuance of the struggle his name was frequently mentioned in the Bombay and other journals for his acts of gallantry and daring. 1860 (April 30/ \u2014 Died, at his residence in Cumberland Row, Newcastle, aged 70, Thomas Bell, esq., land valuer and surveyor. In his profession Mr. Bell was a mau of conspicuous ability, and his experience and connections were so considerable that the greater portion of the land in the northern counties had passed under his professional notice. On the death of his father he was appointed one of the surveyors of the Duke of Northumberland. He was also commissioner, valuer, or surveyor on the division of most of the common lands in the district that have been inclosed ; and was arbitrator for the settlement of the purchase money of the land abstracted by the formation of various railways in the northern districts during the last half century. Although Mr. Bell has not left behind him any published works, his own library was greatly enriched by his M.S. genealogical and antiquarian compositions. He likewise greatly assisted his late friend and associate \u2014 the Rev. John Hodgson \u2014 in his \" History of Northumberland.\" A collector from his youth, Mr. Bell brought together one of the largest and most valuable collections of books, papers, and engravings ever formed in the North of England. He was one ofthe founders of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle, and at the time of his death one of the council of that society. The rise and progress of the Literary and Philosophical Society was also in part indebted to his exertions, and his membership continued to his death. With many of the charitable and religious associations of the district Mr. Bell was officially connected, and otherwise throughout his long life he pursued an even and consistent course as an honourable man and as a worthy aud highly-respected citizen. May 9.\u2014 The bridge by which the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway crosses the Tyne, at Scotswood, about four miles west from Newcastle, was discovered to be on fire this afternoon. The bridge, which consisted of timber, asphalte, and tar, was speedily in a blaze from end to end, and all attempts at subduing the fire were useless. A little after four o'clock the whole of the parapet and floor had fallen in, leaving only the piers standing, with the rails twisted into a diversity of forms, owing to the intensity of the heat to which they had beeen exposed. The fire was supposed to have originated from some cinders falling from the engine into the interstices of the woodwork of the bridge. May 13. \u2014 Two sermons were preached in St. John's Church, Newcastle, and collections made after morning and evening service, in aid of the funds for liquidating the debt on the church. The Mayor and several members of the Corporation attended"], [388, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.r. 1860 376 morning service, when the sermons was preached by the Rev. G. R. Moncrieff, M.A. The same gentleman also preached in the evening. 1860 (May 25). \u2014 This evening, the annual conversazione ofthe Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle, took place in the society's rooms, Westgate-Street. .The ordinary interest of the anniversary was increased by the opening for use of the new lecture hall so munificiently provided by Sir W. G, Armstrong, the president. At eight o'clock the company had assembled, and John Clayton, esq., as thesenior vice-president, took the chair, and delivered an opening address, in which he traced the various steps in the history of the institution, from its foundation, in 1792, by that excellent man, the Rev. William Turner. The institution, he said, laboured long under a load of debt, till the liberal and generous offer of Mr. Robert Stephenson supplied the deficiency. The success which had from that time attended the institution rendered a new lecture room necessary, and this had been supplied by their gifted president. Sir William George Armstrong, whom they had all known from his youth. They had marked his onward course, and hailed the triumph of talent and perseverance founded upon innate worth ; and he was sure there was no one there who did not fully appreciate his merits, his modesty, and his unostentatious character, which had won for him the regard of all with whom he had been brought in contact- He (Mr. C.) was sure every one present would feel with him that their best thanks were due to Sir William, and would unite in wishing he might long live to see the fruits of his liberality. The walls of the library were covered with paintings, contributed by Dr. De Mey, Mr. John R. Mather, Mr. G. Mathison, Mr. T. Nicholson, Mr. Winship, Mr. R Atkinson, Mr. Robinson Elliott, Mr. Jos. Armstrong, Mr. W. S. Pringle, Mr. Muras, Mr. Jos. Davison, Mr. S. Stout, Mr. Tweedy, Messrs. Adamson. and Messrs. L. Mackey and Co. (Victoria Rooms).

Mr. Huston; minerals, by John Williamsom ; crystals, by Mr. R. C. Clapham ; Norwegian articles, by Dr. Charlton; and of autographs of eminent men, collected by Mr. T. W. Reid. The object, however, which drew most attention, was the gun with which Sir YV. G. Armstrong made his famous experiments. This was the first gun manufactured by Sir William, and was commenced in the latter part of 1854, and finished in March, 1855. Though upwards of 2,000 rounds had been fired from it, the gun seemed uninjured, and as perfect as if"], [389, "A.D. 1860.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 377 just turned out of the works. On one of the tables was the singular object of a piece of plank from the barque Maude, of Newcastle, which, while on a voyage from Calcutta, was struck by a sword fish ; a large portion of the sword was still remaining in the wood. Refreshments in great abundance were provided as usual, and Messrs. Hemy and Watson's band played during the evening. 1860 (June 13/ \u2014 Died, at his residence, Whitehall Gardens, in the 77th year of his age, Cuthbert Ellison, esq., of Hebburn Hall, in the county of Durham.

Mr. Ellison was succeeded in the Hebburn Estate by his nephew, Lieutenant Colonel Ellison of the Grenadier Guards. Mr. Ellison represented Newcastle, in Parliament, for twenty years. In politics he was a Liberal Conservative, in religion a sound Protestant, attached to the Established Church, but free from all feeling of exclusiveness, and treating with respect christians of every denomination. His funeral, which was strictly private, took place at Kingsbury, in the county of Middlesex, on the 19th, when his mortal remains were deposited by the side ofthe faithful companion of his married life. June 26. \u2014 The Newcastle Races, the greatest meeting in the Northern Counties, commenced this day, and were attended with their usual success. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. J. Whittaker's First Lord (Page), beating Butterfly, Bivouac, and nine others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. J. Osborne's Wild man (Grimshaw), beating Hetty, Tousle, and four others. July 1. \u2014 This evening, an accident occurred on the Bishop Auckland Branch Railway, by which an engine-driver and fireman were killed instantly. A train left Bishop Auckland for Sunderland, at eight o'clock, and when about to enter the Red Hill Cut, about half-a-miie to the west of Durham, the engine suddenly became detached from the tender, and fell over on one side of the line, the tender detaching itself from the carriages, falling over on the other. The carriages ran for a short distance between the two, but, being off the line, soon came to a dead stand. The engine driver John Hall, and the fireman John Henry David French, were killed on the spot, none of the passengers being injured. July 14 \u2014 A very destructive fire took place this evening, in the working premises of Mr. B. C. Lawton, the well known builder and contractor, situate at Rye-hill, Newcastle.

The engines from the North British and Newcastle Fire Offices, and from the Central Station, also got to work, but the fire was not got under until about one o'clock. Unfortunately a great deal of damage was done to the premises and the material for building. 1860 (July 23/ \u2014 Died, at Preston Tower, Northumberland, aged 75, Miss Frances Isabel Craster, daughter of the late Shafto Craster, esq., of Craster, in the same county.

From the decorated ceiling three superb and massive chandeliers threw a soft flood of light, and at the upper end of the room tables were spread with refreshments of the most recherche character, which did the utmost credit to the taste and liberality of Mr. and Miss Marshall, the wardens of the rooms, and from the castle there was an abundant supply of ices and grapes, in \" bacchanal' pro fusion, and other delicious and cooling fruits of the season ; and seldom has a more brilliant assemblage \u2014 amounting to about 250 of the elite of the county of Northumberland \u2014 graced these rooms, for \" Northumbria's capitial had gathered there her beauty and her chivalry.\" August 9. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick, aged 83, Mr. William Cleg horn, more generally known as \" Billy Conolly.\" He was the last of the old eccentricities of that town.

This venerable and highly- respected gentleman succeeded his father as sixth baronet it 1786, and in the following year he married Emma, daughter of Richard Henry Alexander Bennet, esq., of Beckenham, Kent, by whom he had two sons and three daughters, all of whom survived him except his eldest son, Edward, who died a few years previous, leaving a son, Henry, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, who succeeded to the title and estate. Sir John Swinburne was the model of a country gentleman, and a person of great taste and excellent understanding. Throughout his long career he maintained the character of a most kind and liberal landlord ; and residing for the most pait on his patrimonial estates in the North, discharged all the duties of his station in a most exemplary manner ; and was ever ready, not only to assist the needy and unfortunate, but to dispense a generous hospitality to his numerous friends. His death was deeply deplored by all who knew him or partook of his bounty. Sir John was the second president of the Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle, an office which he held for many years. He was also president of the Society of Antiquarians, Newcastle, in the affairs of which he took a lively interest. September 29. \u2014 This evening a shocking murder was perpetrated in a cottage adjoining Urpeth Com Mill, about seven miles south-west of Newcastle. The murderer's name was Milner Lockey. About three months previous he was, by an order of the Chester-le-Street magistrates, separated from his wife, who then went to live in the cottage where the dreadful occurrence took place. Lockey was 60 years of age, and his wife 49. The unfortunate man who met his death was named Thomas Harrison. He was for many years an inspector of police in Newcastle. He afterwards obtained an appointment in the Bankruptcy Court as bailiff, and in this capacity he was put in possession of the stock and crops upon the farm of Mr. T. C. Bell, Urpeth, who had become a bankrupt. That he might be as near the farm as possible, he took"], [392, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1860. 380 lodgings with Mrs. Lockey, and on the night of the murder, being unwell, he had gone to bed in the kitchen, where he always slept. On Lockey entering the kitchen, he commenced quarrelling with his wife, and drawing a long-bladed knife made a thrust at her chest, at the same time shouting \" I'll kill the whole fleet of you, and that b in bed as well.\" Harrison at this point begged Lockey to desist from using the knife. On this Lockey ran towards Harrison and plunged the knife into his left side, and continued to thrust it in, deeper and deeper, until his wife dragged him away. Harrison sank into a chair at the head of the bed, his head fell ou the pillow, and in a sew minutes he was dead. Lockey was tried at the ensuing Winter Gaol Delivery at Durham, was convicted, and executed on the 2 7th of December following. 1860 (October 6/ \u2014 A curious case came before the Alnwick magis trates this morning. Mr. George Dunn, of Christon Bank, brother to Mr. W. Dunn, of Newcastle, had been staying for the shooting season at the Blue Bell Inn, Belford, in which there resided another Mr. George Dunn, a publican. Mr. Woodman, solicitor, Morpeth, despatched a letter to G. Dunn, esq., stating that he had received \u00a3308 3s. due to him, and desiring to be instructed how he should dispose of it. Mr. Dunn, the publican, replied through Mr. Moore, schoolmaster, that Mr. Woodman might send a cheque for the amount, which was received on the following day, by Mr. Dunn, the publican, who presented the cheque at Lambton's Bank, Newcastle, and received the full amount in cash. Mrs. Dunn replied to Mr. Woodman's last letter, and acknowledged the receipt of the cheque, but the orthography arousing Mr. Woodman's suspicion, he communicated with the police, and it was ascertained that Dunn had disbursed to his creditors \u00a3290 of the \u00a3308 3s. In the house \u00a3118 was found. Mr. Dunn was committed for trial at the Sessions, on the charge of fraudulently obtaining the money. On the 18th he was brought up for trial, and honourably acquitted of any fraudulent intention. November 6. \u2014 This morning a man, named John Baty, was found brutally murdered near Winlaton. The deceased lived in Cuthbert-street, Blaydon, and was a slater, and well known as a clever workman, and a quiet respectable man. He had been at a shooting match on the previous day at Blaydon Burn and was seen late at night in the company of a man named Thomas Smith, a pitman, who immediately disappeared. On the 16th Smith was recognised at Port Mulgrave, near Whitby, by a man named Irving, with whom he had worked at Haltwhistle. Smith was dressed in the clothes which he had stripped off Baty. Irving brought him to Gateshead, and, on the way, Smith said he had a tussel with Baty, but did not expect he had killed him. He was brought up at the ensuing Durham Assizes, convicted ofthe murder, and was executed on the 27th December along with Milner Lockey. November 7. \u2014 Ihe interesting ceremony of presenting Mr. Alderman Wallis, of South Shields, with a suitable public testimonial on his retirement from the medical profession, took place"], [393, "A.D. 1860.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 381 in the long room of the Golden Lion Inn, in that town. A large number of the gentry ofthe neighbourhood assembled on the occasion. The testimonial was designed to answer the double purpose of a candelabrum and an epergne. Two well composed emblematical figures of Justice and Benevolence stand upon a pedestal. A vine stem, springing from the centre of the pedestal, shoots up between the two figures, over which it expands in six luxuriant and grace fully undulating branches. The entire work is formed of solid silver, the figures being frosted, and the rest burnished. The value of the whole is about \u00a3200. On the front of the pedestal is the following inscription: \u2014 \"Presented to Robert Wallis, esq, J. P., by his numerous friends, on his retirement from the medical profession, in testimony of their high esteem for his professional talent, his humanity to the suffering poor, his benevolence to the necessitous, and the many other virtues that adorn his personal character.\" The Mayor presided, and the presentation was made by R. W. Swinburne, esq. Mr. Wallis gratefully acknowledged the gift. 1860 (hovember 9). \u2014 The annual election of chief magistrates for the counties of Northumberland and Durham took place this day : \u2014 -Newcastle \u2014 Aid. Ingledew, esq., mayor; Thomas Hedley, esq., fcheriff. Gateshead\u2014 James Hewitt, esq. Sunderland \u2014 Samuel Alcock, esq. South Shields \u2014 Aid. Wallis, esq. Tynemouth \u2014 Aid. Mease, esq. Morpieth \u2014 Dr. O'Connor. December 6. \u2014 Owing to the appointment conferred by the ministry upon George Ridley, esq., the nomination of a represen tative for Newcastle took place this morning on the hustings erected in front of the Guildhall. The candidates were Peter Carstairs and S. A. Beaumont, esqrs. Mr. Bainbridge nominated Mr. Carstairs, and Mr. F. Staniford briefly seconded the nomi nation. Sir William George Armstrong proposed, and R. W. Hodgson seconded Mr. S. A. Beaumont. The polling took place on the following day, which resulted in the return of Mr. Beaumont, who polled 2,346, and Mr. Carstairs, 1,500. December 10. \u2014 One of the most brilliant balls that had taken place in Newcastle for many years came off this evening at the Assembly Rooms, Westgate-street, on which occasion there was a large, though extremely select, gathering of the nobility, clergy, and gentry of Newcastle and of the adjoining counties of Northumberland and Durham, as well as of several of our gallant naval and military officers. The ball was given under the auspices of the bachelors of the town and neighbourhood. Messrs. Hemy and Watson's celebrated quadrille band occupied the platform orchestra, and their performances were the theme of general admiration throughout the entire ball. The gay and happy assembly did not separate till a late hour. December 20. \u2014 This evening another of those lamentable explosions, so frequent in this district, took place in one of the workings of the far-famed Hetton Colliery ; and unfortunately, twenty-two persons fell victims, not improbably, to the recklessness or carelessness of some of themselves, or, it may be, to hidden"], [394, "382 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF s_A.D. 1861. causes which are inexplicable. The whole of the horses and ponies in the pit were destroyed by fire, which had seized on the hay in the stables, and the way in which they met their death was horrible in the extreme. 1861 (January 11/ \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred to a man named William Lucas, at the Goods Station, Trafalgar-street, Newcastle. The deceased was gathering together some grain, which had accidentally fallen from the waggons, for the purpose of taking home to his poultry, when some waggons, which were pushed up the line, carried him ten or twelve yards, and then crushed him against some other waggons. When picked up his legs where found to be bioken, and his body otherwise so much mutilated that he died shortly afterwards. January 22. \u2014 A man, named John Forster, alias John Winship, was summoned before the Borough Police Court, New castle, for having worked an illicit still, at a house which he occupied, known by the name of Heaton Hall Garden House. Mr. John Young, superintendent of excise, went, in company with Mr. Mattinson, another Inland Revenue officer, to the defendant's house, in consequence of information they had received, and there found all necessary apparatus for working an illicit still. There were two machines, one able to work about 40 gallons of spirits and the other about 80 gallons, thereby robbing the country of at least \u00a330 per week. On inquiry it was found that the defendant had engaged the cottage from Mr. Matthew Stephenson, who acted as agent for the landlord, Mr. Potter, at \u00a37 a year rent. The defendant, who did not appear, was fined \u00a350 in each case. January 25. \u2014 A public meeting was held in the Grammar School, Rothbury, for the purpose of presenting a testimonial to William Davy, esq., of that place. The testimonial, which was very much admired, consisted of a costly and elegant tea and coffee service, from the establishment of Messrs. Reid and Sons, Newcastle. On the teapot was engraved the following inscrip tion : \u2014 \" This Tea and Coffee Service presented to Mr. William Davy, sor his efficient services as Secretary to the Rothbury Floral and Horticultural Society, by the Committee aud other friends, as a token of their respect and esteem. 25th January, 1861.\" The meeting was presided over by Edward Pringle, esq., of Snitter, and the service presented by George Milburn, esq , of Rothbury, in a most eloquent and feeling address, ta which Mr. Davy responded in corresponding terms. At the conclusion of the pre sentation a large portion of the meeting adjourned to the Three Half Moons Inn, and sat down to a substantial supper, provided by the host, Mr. Lawson, for the occasion. The festivities were prolonged until a late hour, and a more pleasant and harmonious evening was never spent in the good old town of Rothbury. February 5. \u2014 Messrs. R. Morrison and Co., of the Ouseburn, Newcastle, cast an enormous anvil block, weighing upwards of thirty-four tons, for the Elswick Ordnance Works. The melting of the metal occupied five hours, and the immense mass took three"], [395, "A.D. 1861. J REMARKABLE EVENTS, 383 weeks to cool, when it was removed to its bed at Elswick. The waggon on which this immense block of iron was conveyed was of ten tons weight, and was drawn by a team of forty-five powerful horses. 1861 (February G.) \u2014 A ploughing day, on a liberal scale, was held at Chillingham Newtown, in consequence of Mr. James Hall, of Detchant, having taken that farm. Nearly 150 well appointed teams mustered on the occasion, and the day being fine, the work was most creditably performed by the stalwart sons of Glendale on the fine alluvial deposits of this beautiful farm. A select party of friends enjoyed the kind hospitality of Mr. Hall in the evening, and expressed to him their most heartfelt wishes of success, and a protracted enjoyment of health, happiness, and prosperity on the sunny banks of the Till. February 22. \u2014 This afternoon, at Sunderland, Mr. Hardcastle opened the sale of 1,500 \u00a35 shares in the Sunderland and South Shields Water Company in one of his happiest moods, and com menced, literally in a galop, to knock down the shares right and left, there being great demand for them, and the capital price of \u00a38 12s being reached for 467 shares, \u00a38 11s 6d for 581 shares, and \u00a38 10s for 452 shares. After a shoit and spirited speech of the auctioneer, the whole of the 1,500 shares were sold in the almost incredible space of from twelve to fifteen minutes, in forty-six lots, each lot being, in number, according to the choice of the purchaser, but not exceeding fifty shares each lot. February 23. \u2014 A locomotive exploded at Blyth Station this morning, where it was standing to start the 80 train for Newcastle. By a most singular providence, notwithstanding the number of people standing about, no lives were lost, though accidents occurred which were comparatively trifling. Richard Charlton, engine-driver, was struck by the flying metal on the legs, one of which was broken below the knee, and the other deeply cut. The fireman of the engine, named Robinson, was struck on the head, stunned, and cut, but after a few minutes gradually recovered. The driver of the engine was cut on the foot. Drs. Trotter and Ward treated the cases. The immense force of the explosion may be judged of by the fact that metal was found at the Central Hall, 1,000 yards off, in one direction, and in the shipbuilding yard of Mr. George Robin son, about the same distance, in an opposite direction. About half of the boiler, weighing some sour tons, was carried 150 yards, and en tering a house on Cowpen Quay, occupied by Mrs. Robson, smashed in the window and root of the house, and alighted on the floor of the second storey without further injury, excepting to some articles of furniture. February 28. \u2014 Mr. John Dixon Laws, brewer, who was leaving Pont eland, was entertained at dinner at Mrs. Yeamen's, the Seven Stars, by between forty and fifty gentlemen, who, as neighbours and friends, desired to show their respect and esteem for his busi ness-like habits and his conduct as a man during his residence amongst them. The dinner was served in the usual good style of"], [396, "384 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1861 the hostess, the chair being occupied by William Berkeley, esq., of Eland Hall, and the vice-chairs by Richard Reay and J. Temperly, esqs. Aster dinner and the usual loyal toasts, the chairman gave the health of Mr. Laws, and prosperity in his new undertaking, to which Mr. Laws responded in an appropriate speech. Mr. Laws was about to enter upon the extensive premises in Morpeth, known as the New Brewery. 1861 (March 16). \u2014 A robbery of a very serious character was discovered this morning to have been committed at the offices of the Shotley Tin and Iron Works, the establishment of Messrs. J. B. Richardson and Co. The sum of \u00a31,240 5s, chiefly sovereigns, in tended for the payment of the workmen's wages, had been deposited in a patent iron safe on the previous evening, and the whole of this large amount had been abstracted and carried off* The consterna tion of the officials, when the burglary was discovered, may be easily conceived. March 23. \u2014 A very extensive and alarming fire took place this evening in Nun-stieet, Newcastle. The catastrophe originated on the premises of Mr. Grierson, gutta percha boot and shoe maker. Upon a fire in the back premises was placed a pan, containing a solution composed of naphtha and other similarly inflammable ingredients. The solution boiled over, and falling upon the fire became ignited. Two apprentices, who attempted to remove the pan into the back yard, upset it on the stairs, which were set on fire immediately, and the flames shot up with immense rapidity. The two apprentices were severely burnt, and rushed screaming into the street, which was full of people, who extinguished the flames, but not before the poor fellows were severely burnt. Mr. Grierson attempted to quench the burning naphtha, but he also got enveloped in flames. In this condition he ran into the street, where the flames were extinguished, but he was so severely burnt, that it was found necessary to convey him to the Infirmary. The flames, in a few minutes, were raging fearfully out of the two top windows of the premises, which are four stories in height. Unhappily four persons were engaged at work in the upper storeys. One of them, named James Scott, attempted to make his escape by the stairs, but was never more seen alive. His body was after wards found literally burnt to a cinder. The other three escaped by the windows, and one, named Robert Wallace, was so severely injured that he died next day. The damage was estimated at several hundreds of pounds. April 5. \u2014 This day, the birthday of the late Lieutenant- General Sir Henry Havelock, bait., was commemorated in Sunderland by the elevation of the large statue of the gallant hero to its pedestal, at the top of Building Hill, in the Mowbray Park. The statue, which is of bronze, is ten feet high, weighs upwards of two tons fifteen cwt., and stands, facing the west, upon a granite pedestal, twelve feet high. April 10. \u2014 Tbe marriage of Colonel Sir David Wood, bart., K.C.B., with the Hon. Miss Liddell, eldest daughter of the Right"], [397, "A.D. 1861.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 385 Hon. Lord Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle, Durham, and Eslington, Northumberland, took place at Lamesley Parish Church, near Gateshead. On the party leaving the church, the scene that presented itself was one of the liveliest description. The sun shone with unclouded brilliancy, bells rang merry peals, the band played, the cannons were fired, and the spectators cheered vociferously. The children, many of them dressed in white, attending the Lamesley and Lady Park Schools, strewed flowers in the path of the bride, as she was led by Sir David to the carriage, and the cortege drove off, on its return to Ravensworth Castle, amidst the most lively manifestations of rejoicings. 1861 (April 16/ \u2014 The remains of Master Herbert Taylor, only son of Mr. William Taylor, merchant, Newcastle, were discovered this evening iu the river Skerne, near Darlington. He was at Mr. Mackey's school, and had disappeared in a most mysterious manner, having been missing for eighteen days. His premature death plunged his family into the deepest grief. He was a fine promising child, in his ninth year, \u2014 lively and intelligent, and of the most affectionate and engaging disposition. The body was brought to Newcastle, the next morning, for interment. April 22. \u2014 Hugh Taylor, esq , having retired from the represen tation of Tynemouth, the nomination of candidates took place this morning on hustings erected in front of the New Town Hall, North Shields. Mr. John Drydeu proposed, and Mr. Matthew Popplewell seconded, Richard Hodgson, esq. Mr. John Fawcus nominated Mr. Otway, and Mr. John Spence seconded the nomi nation. The polling took place on the following day, when the numbers were : \u2014 Mr. Hodgson, 425 ; Mr. Otway, 376. Mr. Hodgson left the town in the evening, and as he was taking his departure a most disgraceful scene took place. He and his friends were set upon in the streets by a mob, and force of thirty police officers barely sufficed to keep the crowd from doing him personal violence. As it was, missiles were thrown, one of which, a half brick, hit Mr. Hodgson on the head and inflicted a serious wound ; and it was with the greatest difficulty that the police force procured him a passage through the streets to the railway station. April 24s. \u2014 This afternoon the banks of the Tyne presented a brilliant spectacle, on the occasion of the launch of a screw steam war frigate from the yard of Messrs. Palmer Brothers at Jarrow. The vessel, which was named the Defence, was considered to be one of the greatest feats in shipbuilding that had then been achieved in this locality. The dimensions of the Defence are : \u2014 Extreme length over all, 292 feet ; breadth, 54 feet ; depth from the upper deck, 39 feet. Her tonnage is 3,069 register. She was pierced to carry 28 Armstrong guns, of lOOlbs. each- April 28. \u2014 The scullers' match between J. H. Clasper, of Newcastle, and T. Pocock, of London, came off on the Thames, and, after a well-contested race, Clasper won by about six boat lengths. VOL. III. b 2"], [398, "386 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1861. 1861 (May 7/ \u2014 An alarming occurrence tookplace in Dean-street, Newcastle. A cart, belonging to Mrs. Robson, of the Barras bridge, containing a puncheon of whiskey, was being driven down the street by two men, named Robert Rutherford and John Turner, when a portion of the harness suddenly gave way, and the animal set off, at a frightful speed towards the Sandhill. The two men, who were at the side of the horse at the time, ran with it, but before reaching the bottom of the hill Rutherford fell on his face below the animal, and the cart passed over the lower part of his back. The horse was untimately stopped by coming in contact with a cart and horse standing at the shop door of Mr. Wilkinson, Sand hill. Turner was likewise thrown to the ground, and sustained some severe injuries about the legs. Rutherford was taken to the Infirmary, where he remained some time in a a very precarious condition. May 9. \u2014 The ancient ceremony of traversing the boundary ofthe river Tyne took place to day. The Mayor (Henry Ingledew, esq.), and the Corporation of Newcastle, the River Tyne Commis sioners, the Stewards of the Incorporated Companies of the Freeman of the Borough, the Master and Brethren of the Trinity House, the Mayor and Corporation of Gateshead, &c, were present. The \" perambulation\" was of the most imposing and enthusiastic character, and the occasion was observed, by the majority of the inhabitants, as a partial holiday The weather throughout the day was fine, though a cold wind blew briskly from the north. Early in the morning the merry bells of St. Nicholas' were rung, and of St. Mary's Church at Gateshead, guns were fired, instruments of music were played, flags and banners were displayed from windows, and from the rigging of every vessel in the Tyne, and every thing wore a holiday appearance. The river was literally covered with steamers, boats, skiffs, gigs, &c , many of which accompanied the party in their perambulations. The fol lowing is a copy of the proclamation made at various places during the survey, viz: \u2014 \"OYEZ! OYEZ!! OYEZ!!!\" \" Proclamation is hereby made that the Soil of the River Tyne, wherever covered with water, between Hedwin Streams and Sparhawk. is within the Borough of Newcastle -upon-Tyne, and belongs to, and is within the Juris diction of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the said Borough.\" HENRY INGLEDEW, Mayor. May 11. \u2014 An accident, which created no little sensation in Newcastle, occurred to a gentleman well known in commercial circles, who was a member of the lst company of the Newcastle Volunteer Rifles. It appeared that Mr. Matthew Raine Wheatley, the gentleman in question, had travelled by one of the early trains to the south. He had left the train either at the Felling or Pelaw Main. It was supposed that he had proceeded to walk upon the line between the above stations. On getting some short distance into the tunnel he had got upon the down line, and a train, which was due, coming up, knocked him down, and mutilated him"], [399, "A.D. 1861.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 387 frightfully. Some platelayers, going to their work, discovered Mr. Wheatley lying on the line, He was placed in the next train and conveyed to Newcastle Infirmary, where he expired about five o'clock on the same day. 1861 (May 14/ \u2014 A bazaar in aid of the building fund of the High bridge U. P. Church, was commenced this morning in the Music Hall, Nelson-street, Newcastle, and continued until late in the evening, with a success that exceeded the most sanguine expectations. The room presented a gay and brilliant appearance. The bazaar contained a large variety of articles, both useful and ornamental, and adapted for either ladies or gentlemen. The proceedings were much enlivened by a selection of entertainments, including a powerful telescope, an electric battery, a post-office, a weighing machine, &c. The following ladies presided at the various stalls : \u2014 No. 1, Mrs. Geekie, assisted by Miss Beveridge, Miss McKie, and Miss Irving ; No. 2, Miss A. Prendick, assisted by Miss Bell, Miss Best, and Miss Forster ; No. 3, Mrs. Easton, assisted by Miss Cummings, Mrs. and Miss Forth, Miss Easton, Miss Scott, and Mrs. Smith ; No. 4, Mrs. Scott, Misses Scott, and Miss Temperley ; No. 5, Mrs. Edminson, Misses Edminson, Mrs. Bell, and Mrs. John Edminson ; No. 6, Mrs. and Miss Patrick, and Miss Atkinson; refreshment stall, Mrs. Mathison, Mrs. Carson, Mrs. Ellison, Mrs. Bell, Miss Hall, and Miss Clarke ; toy stall, Mrs. Potter ; piano forte, Miss Smith. The galvanic battery was attended to by Mr. Alder, chemist ; the electric battery by Mr. W. Patterson ; the weighing machine by Mr. M. Hendrick ; the panorama by Mr. G. Patterson ; and the post-office by Mr. John Edminson. The sum realized was \u00a3110 18s. 7-g-d. On the following day the bazaar was continued from eleven o'clock, and the proceeding were equally interesting and satisfactory. The total proceeds being \u00a3222 5s. 2d. May 21.\u2014 The inauguration of the Havelock Monument, at Sunderland, came off to day, and caused the greatest multitude of people that was ever assembled in that town. The statue represents the hero as a general of the army wearing the insignia of the Order of the Bath, the right arm extended grasping the hilt of a sword, the left holding a telescope, and resting above the left hip. The drapery is a military cloak falling off the left shoulder. The profile of the figure is fine and bold in relief, as seen on approaching the hill from north or south, and the whole contour is grand, dignified, and graceful in conception. The likeness was pronounced by Lady Havelock to be all that the sculptor could achieve, and fully maintains the reputation of Mr. Behnes for the remarkable fidelity of his likenesses. May 30. \u2014 A fatal accident occurred to a boy named William Simpson, belonging to Craster. It appeared that on that day, accompanied by his brother John, he proceeded to Howick with fish, and on returning by a foot road along the cliffs, near a lofty and rugged point of basaltic rock, called Cullernose, about eighty feet high, he lay down on his breast on the edge of the cliff, for the"], [400, "388 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D 1861. purpose of gathering some wild flowers, when he fell over. The other brother ran round to the bottom of the cliff, where he found him lying insensible, and bleeding from a wound in the head. He was conveyed home, but never spoke, and died shortly afterwards. Cullernose is the southern point of the rugged ridge of basaltic rocks which extend from Dunstanborough Castle to near Howick, and is the favourite resort of the geologist and botanist. The rarest plant which grows there is Asplenium Marinum, and at a short distance the interesting Scilla Verna, and other flowers of rarity grow abundantly. 1861 (May 31J.\u2014 From the annual report of the treasure ros the Jesmond Cemetery, made up to, and inclusive of the above date, it appeared that there were precisely the same number of inter ments in that place of sepulture during the past year, as in that immediately preceding it. What tends to make the above more remarkable is the fact that during the few years previous no fewer than four new places had been opened for the burial of the dead. June 5 \u2014 This evening a melancholy and fatal accident occurred on the Morpeth Turnpike, a little north of the village of Stannington. Mark Trueman, who had been for upwards of twenty yeats carrier between Shilbottle and Newcastle, was proceeding on his journey towards Newcastle with his cart. Two gentlemen, passing in a gig, observed the horse to swerve to one side, and the unfortunate man fell to the ground head forwards, and dislocated his neck. He was conveyed to the Lion public house in that village, and died almost immediately. June 25. \u2014 The Newcastle Races commenced this day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Stewart's b c Joey Jones (Doyle), beating Underhand, Doefoot, and six others. The Gold Cup was won by Colonel Towneley's ch f Doefoot (Snowdon), beating Ettrick Dale, Hegira, and three others. July 4. \u2014 Universal sorrow and regret were experienced in Newcastle this afternoon on the announcement, which passed from mouth to mouth, that Mr. Richard Grainger was dead. The event seemed scarcely to be real, so suddenly had it occurred ; but the solemn tone of St. Nicholas' bell too truly confirmed the intelligence. His medical adviser, Dr. Frost, called upon him about twelve o'clock, and found him in his usual health. Scarcely, however, had the doctor left, than Mr. Grainger complained of being very ill. Dr. Frost was immediately sent for, and on his return he found Mr. Grainger in a dying state. The. immediate cause of death was supposed to be heart disease. In speaking of Mr. Grainger as a public benefactor to Newcastle, it is difficult to state precisely the value of his services. It may be said of him, \" If you seek bis monument look around.\" Like the great majority of eminent men, Mr. Grainger rose from the ranks ; aud with the Stowells, Eldons, Huttons, Stephensons, and many other superior geniuses of whose fame Newcastle has reason to be proud, his name will live among posterity as an example of what integrity, perseverance, and energy can accomplish. Mr. Grainger was born in High Friar-"], [401, "A D. 1861.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 389 street, Newcastle, in 1798. The humble circumstances of the family precluded any education, except such as was to be obtained at the charity schools of the town ; and Richard, who was the third son, owed all the schooling he got to such an institution. Some are still living who remember him in his green badge coat, with a round, ruddy, smiling face, and quiet manner. His studies, while at school, were confined to the Bible, Tinwell's Arithmetic. and a spelling book. After leaving school he was apprenticed to Mr. Brown, a house carpenter aud joiner. On the completion of his apprenticeship, Mr. Batson, a wealthy member of the religious body to which Richard belonged, became interested in him, and gave him the first opportunity of distinguishing himself. This gentleman was engaged in the erection of Higharn-place when Grainger set up for himself, and the new builder was engaged by Mr. Batson to build some of his houses. The old builders, who were engaged in other portions of the erections, vented their ridicule upon so young a man, \" a raw lad,\" being so employed. However, the work was well and thoroughly done. The \" raw lad\" exhibited the greatest industry, rising early and working late. Shortly afterwards Mr. Grainger married, aud from that period his progress was one of great success Mrs. Grainger was the eldest daughter of the late Joseph Arundale, esq., tanner, of Newcastle, by whom he had fifteen children, ten of whom survived him. Mrs. Grainger was a wise in every sense of the word : assisting her husband by conducting his correspondence, keeping his accounts, and in many other ways relieving him from much anxiety and care. Mr. Grainger's first great enterprize was the erection of Eldon square, composed of handsome stone houses, of a solid, plain, and uniform style. He next projected Leazes-terrace and crescent, containing seventy first-class and sixty second-class houses, with polished stone fronts and highly ornamented. He next projected the Arcade. At length Mr. Grainger purchased twelve acres in the middle of the town (a spot known as Anderson's-place) for the sum of \u00a350,000. Great was the public curiosity to know his object, but he kept it a profound secret, and not a particular was known until his arrangements were completed. Without Act of Parliament he had bought other old property to the amount of \u00a345,000, being enough to enable him to open communication between some of the busy parts of the town, distant from each other, and which could only be reached by widely circuitous ways. He now formed a central street, and his plans being too large for his own powers, he associated with him the Town Clerk (John Clayton, esq ), and submitted his designs and proposals to public inspection. The popular voice was so strong and loud in favour of their execution that the Corporation gave up the old market, which stood in the way, and taking \u00a315,000 for the old one, gave \u00a336,000 for the new one, which was opened in 1835. This market is the finest in the kingdom, exceeding even Hungerford and Liverpool markets in size and convenience. At the head of Grey-street, one of the most splendid streets in England, is the great Central"], [402, "390 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1861. Exchange. This massive building is the most conspicuous in the town from its central situation, and the magnificence of its design. Grainger also built Grainger-street, 300 yards long and 66 feet wide; Market-street, 190 yards long and 66 feet 'wide; Clayton street, 516 yards long ; and Clayton-street West, 220 yards long and 62 feet wide. Many other streets of less length are also Grahiger's work. Thus there were nine new streets added to the town in the course of five years, and nearly one million sterling worth of property by one man. Mr. Grainger was interred at Benwell on the 10th, and no one who witnessed the profound feeling evinced by all classes could fail to perceive that he who had passed away from our midst was a man of no ordinary mark, but one of those truly great men, who, by a happy combination of the qualities which inspire respect and love in others, not only confer the highest benefits on those around them, but are themselves the objects of the affectionate regard and reverence of those for whom they have done so much. 1861 (July 9). \u2014 The second scullers' match between J. H. Clasper, son of the, celebrated Harry Clasper, of Newcastle-upon- Tyne, and Thomas Pocock, of Lambeth, took place this afternoon on the Thames. The stakes were \u00a350 a-side. Clasper rowed in an easy winner by six or seven lengths. July 20. \u2014 A fine little boy, four years of age, son of Alexander McKinzie, cooper, Walker Oil Mill, was sent by his mother a short errand. He did not return in proper time, and, on search being made, his little hand was observed by a man in a small stream, called the Gut, that runs into the river Tyne, not fifty yards from McKinzie's door. The man jumped in and brought out the little fellow, but life was quite extinct. August 23. \u2014 A shocking accident, attended with fatal results, occurred this morning at the Derwent Foundry, situated near to Blackhill, by which one man, named Robert Stirling, was killed on the spot, and another, Robert Birtley, was so seriously injured that he died shortly afterwards. It appeared that in pre paring the mould for a casting, Stirling and Birtley were engaged in fixing the trestles on which the top of the mould had to be placed, that while in the act of so doing the top of the mould, a mass constructed of brick and iron, weighing nearly two tons, slipped and fell upon both the men. September 10. \u2014 A sad and fatal accident occurred at the Tyne Docks Station this morning. A man named John Thompson, a cartman in the employment of Mr. Milburn, contractor, was coming up the road leading from the docks driving a horse and cart. On reaching the gates they were opened to him. While, however, Thompson and his cart were in the act of crossing the down line, the express train came up and struck them. The man and horse were killed on the spot. September 17.\u2014 A fatal accident occurred on board the Wansbeck steamer, one of the Red Star Line of passenger boats, while lying at Newcastle Quay. It appeared that the engineman, named"], [403, "A.D. 1861.] REMARKABLE EVENTS, 391 David Walker, had gone into the paddle-box. The captain, with out knowing the circumstance, gave orders for the steamer to be turned around. The engines were consequently pnt in motion, and the unfortunate man was crushed by the paddle-wheel, and fell into the water. 1861 (October 1/ \u2014 One ofthe most frightful crimes that has been known in England for many years past was perpetrated in Newcastle this morning. The extraordinary report that a murder of a shocking and atrocious nature had been committed in one of the principal thoroughfares of the town, and in broad daylight, and that the victim was a gentleman so well known and universally esteemed as Mr. Mark Frater, ran through the town with incredible rapidity, and wherever it reached caused the greatest consternation and regret. Mr. Frater resided at Bulman's Village, and had been for some years the proprietor of the omnibus that ran between that place and the Grey Monument. This morning, as usual, he left his home by the nine o'clock 'bus, which took him as far as the foot of Northumberland-street, where he alighted and proceeded to his office at the end of Blackett-street. As he reached the door he met a friend, and paused a moment to converse with him ; while so doing, a person named George Clark, stepped quickly up to him, seized him by one hand, and with a knife inflicted a murderous blow upon his neck. The knife entered an inch or two from the right corner of the mouth, inflicting a hideous gash upon the cheek, aud then, glancing past the bone, plunged into the neck, where it severed all the principal arteries. So detirmined was the wretched murderer to accomplish his object, that, after thrusting the knife into his victim, he deliberately wrenched it round in the wound in such a manner that the blade itself was twisted. He then withdrew it, and stood quite still, gazing triumphantly on his unfortunate victim, who, hardly comprehending the nature of the occurrence, slowly turned round and entered the house. On reaching his office he exclaimed to his clerk, \" I'm afraid I'm done for,\" and sank back into a chair. He rapidly became unconscious from the great loss of blood ; and within ten minutes from the time he received the wound he expired. Two gentlemen, who were passing at the moment, a Mr. McGill and a Mr. Dalrymple, saw what had occurred, and at once rushed upon the murderer and secured him. When the prisoner, who was of weak intellect, was charged before the magistrates with having stabbed the deceased, he replied, \" Decidedly so, decidedly so ; I've murdered him ; he robbed me, and now I've robbed him,\" and then added, \" This is a grand job for the penny papers; they'll have a rare sale to-day.\" Mr. Frater had for some time held the situation of tax collector, amongst which was the dog tax ; and Clark having a dog, for which he refused to pay, Mr. Frater had distrained for the amount six months previous. Clark was tried for the murder at the ensuing assizes, was convicted, and sentenced to be hung, but was ultimately reprieved, aud is now confined in an asylum during her majesty's pleasure."], [404, "392 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1861. 186 1 (October3). \u2014 A fashionable wedding took place this morning at the Clayton Memorial Church, Newcastle, between John Gray, esq , of Newlands, Northumberland, and Miss Jackson, only daughter of Collingwood Forster Jackson, esq., of Jesmond, near Newcastle. The path to the church was strewed with flowers, and the bridal party arrived at halt-past ten, they having been conveyed in six carriages, with outriders. The bridge wore a rich white dress, white wreath aud veil, and was led to the altar by her father. There were five bridesmaids, similarly attired in white silk dresses, pale blue streamers, white embroidered muslin shawls, and white bonnets, set with pale blue flowers A numerous party, consisting of the friends of the bride and bridegroom, were present at the interesting ceremony, and the outside of the sacred edifice was thronged by an immense concourse of spectators, amongst whom was showered a liberal supply of silver. November 3. \u2014 An accident of a most dreadful nature occurred this evening at the Manors Station, by which Mr. Charles John Arundale, of 23, Leazes-terrace, Newcastle, lost his life. It appeared that Mr. Arundale, who for some time past had been staying at Cullercoats, had occasion to visit Newcastle, and had arranged to return by the train which leaves the Central Station at 6 p.m. On the train arriving at the Manors, the signalman observed Mr. Arundale to fall backwards between two of the carriages. This was before the train had come quite to a stand, and the wheels of two carriages passed over the unfortunate gentleman's shoulders and neck. Orders were immediately given to reverse the engine, when the body was got out in a state closely bordering upon decapitation, the head being connected with the body simply by one of the muscles of the neck. From the fact of Mr. Arundale falling backwards, it was supposed that he had taken a fit. November 5. \u2014 A grand entertainment was given this evening at the Assembly Rooms, by the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle (Henry Tngledew, esq.), to a party of nearly one hundred gentlemen connected with the town aud neighbourhood. Amongst the guests were Sir Matthew White Ridley, bart., M.P., the Right Hon. T. E. Headlam, M.P., John Hodgson Hinde, esq., the French Consul, the Netherlands Consul, Lieutenant-Colonel Powell, Major Johnson, Captain Woods, the Vicar of Newcastle, the Rev. R. A. Thompson, the Rev. T. Brutton, the Rev. B. Addison, the Borough Magistrates, various members ofthe Corpora- tion, the Town-clerk, the Sheriff, the Under-sheriff, the Mayor of Gateshead, &c, &c. The dinner was of the most sumptuous description, including all the delicacies of the season, and the wines and dessert were such as to satisfy the most fastidious taste.

J REMARKABLE EVENTS, 393 1861 (November 13/ \u2014 Died, at his residence, High-street, Gates head, aged 87, Joshua Greene, esq. The deceased was one of the oldest and most respected merchants in that town, having been connected, as senior partner, with the well-known firm of Messrs. John Greene and Sons over a period extending to within a little of half a century. As a merchant Mr. Greene was held in high estimation for the probity and uprightness of his character by all with whom his mercantile transactions brought him in contact, and he died deservedly respected by all who enjoyed the pleasure of his acquaintance. November 21. \u2014 The enthronization of the Right Rev. Charles Baring, D.D., the newly appointed Bishop of Durham, took place in that cathedral this morning. The event attracted great interest, and there was a large attendance, not only of the inhabi tants of the city, but of the clergy of the diocese. About eleven o'clock his lordship arrived at the northern entrance of the cathedral, where he was received by the Very Rev. G. Waddington, D.D., Dean of Durham, and a large number of the chapter. On arriving at the alter the bishop offered the prayer usual on such occasions, and was then conducted by the dean to his throne, on which he remained during the morning service The throne occupies a greatly elevated position on the south side of the choir, the ascent to it being by fourteen steps. The throne was built in the year 1370 by Bishop Hatfield, for the double purpose of an episcopal seat or chair of state and a canopy over his own tomb. The arms carved on the oaken doorway are those of Bishop Crewe, by whom it was repaired in the year 1700. It is said to be the most elevated episcopal seat in Christendom. November 28. \u2014 One of the most audacious garotte robberies was perpetrated this evening about six o'clock. It appeared that Mr. Robert Turnbull, a commercial traveller, who represents the firm of Messrs. Church and Son, fruit merchants, London, and whose residence was in Summerhill-terrace, Newcastle, was proceeding homewards, and on turning in towards the back of Westmoreland terrace he was met by two men, who immediately seized him, and succeeded in rifling Mr. Turnbull's pocket, from which they abstracted a pocket-book and a purse, the latter containing about \u00a370 in gold and \u00a330 in notes, together with a cheque for \u00a38. The robbery was only the work of a few moments, and, when effected, the perpetrators of the daring deed immediately made off. December 10. \u2014 Died, at Kirknewton, near Wooler, Mr. Andrew Shell. He had nearly completed his 102nd year. The deceased was highly respected, and had been from boyhood the faithful shepherd and esteemed servant of the late Thomas, and his son, C. F. James, esq, Stamford, and of Kirknewton. December 15. \u2014 This evening the official announcement of the death of His Royal Highness Prince Albert reached Newcastle, and the intelligence created but one feeling amongst 'all classes. In every circle the deepest commiseration was felt for her majesty in the heavy loss she had sustained. The principal tradesmen of VOL III.

During the whole ofthe day, with scarcely an exception, every place of business was closed, and special religious services were held in the various churches in the district, and muffled bells were tolled from twelve till one o'clock. 1861 (December 19/ \u2014 This forenoon the remains ofthe late Joseph Garnett, esq., were interred in All Saints' Church-yard, Newcastle, by special permission from the Secretary of State. The funeral procession left the Side, a little before twelve o'clock, in the following order : \u2014 The two mutts, the hearse containing the body, in a shell, a leaden coffin, and a polished oak case, four mourning coaches, and Sir John Fife's carriage, containing Mr. Garbutt, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Thomas Sopwith, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Ions, Dr. Thompson, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Parker, Mr Downey, Mr. Smith, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Hunnam, Mr. W. Dobson, Mr. Thompson, Mr. James Dobson, Mr. Slawin, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Brewis, Rev. T. Brutton, and other gentlemen. December 19. \u2014 An alarming fire broke out this morning at Wynyard Park, the seat of the Marchioness of Londonderry. As soon as the fire was discovered, a sma'l engine belonging to the hall was got out, and was so efficiently woiked by the work people and others on the spot, that it kept the fire in check until the Hartlepool and Stockton engines came up, when it was gradually got under. The damage was estimated at \u00a36,000. 1862 (January 16/ \u2014 One of the most appalling and heartrending catastrophes that has ever occurred in any country took place this morning in Hartley New Pit, near Seaton Delaval. Over the mouth ofthe pit was the beam of a pumping engine, the largest and most powerful in the North of England, the beam weighing about forty tons. The men were being drawn up in the cage by means of the winding machine when the beam of the engine broke and sell into the pit, meeting, in its downward course, the ascending cage with its human eargo, the enormous mass crushing everything in its way. Five were killed instantly, and three were afterwards extricated alive. The beam, it seemed, struck the top of the brattice with such violence that the whole of the massive wooden and iron framework was hurled to the bottom of the mine, thus cutting off all means of escape from the lower portion of the mine. in which were 215 men and boys buried alive. Immediately on the nature of the accident becoming known, the pit mouth was crowded with noble fellows, who at once volunteered to enter the mine, and render every assistance in their power to rescue the living and recover the mangled remains of the dead. The viewer, Charles Carr, esq., and his assistant, Mr. Humble, were soon on the spot, along with Hugh Taylor, esq., of Backworth ; T. E. Forster, esq., Newcastle ; M. Dunn, esq., her majesty's inspector of mines ; Mr. Coulson, the master sinker of North Seaton Colliery ; and many otLxr able and scientific men connected with the coal trade. The shattered cage was, after herculean exertions,"], [407, "a.d. 1862.] remarkable events. 395 brought up smashed and torn, as if it had been manufactured of the weakest tin instead of the strongest wrought iron. The rims, about an inch thick, were shivered as if they had been the thinnest of tissue paper. And now commenced, in this district, six days of the most intense anxiety and harrowing suspense. Mr. Coulson and his heroic assistants laboured almost day and night in removing the debris, so as to form a communication with the men in the pit. Imagination in vain attempts to paint the scene which went on below : the agony of suspense they must have endured, the torturing terrors of their dim and stifling gallery, are all beyond conception ; and then the pale, sorrowing watchers above, who thought of neither night nor day, nor of cold nor of privations, while waiting in dread anxiety for husbands, brothers, and children engulphed in that dark abyss. At last, on the 22nd, an opening was made into the workings, and one of the brave shift men, named William Adams, accompanied by two companions, entered the mine. They went along till they came to the bodies of two of the entombed men. Pushing their way along, at great danger to themselves, for the air was very bad, they sound more bodies strewn in all direc tions. In all the ghastly company not one spark of precious life remained. On the body of Amour, the back-overman, was found, written in pencil on a torn newspaper, in a straggling handwriting, the following memorandum : \u2014 \" Friday afternoon, at half-pait two. \"Edward Ar-nj on^-, Thomas G'.tut.fcon, John Hardy, Thomas Bell, and ot'ievs, took ex.' ..emely i !.. We ;\u25a0' sio hac! a p,.i-.ye,--meetiDg at a quarter to two when Tibo^ Henry rf'iri'->, J Campbell, Henry Gibson, and William Palmer . Tibbs exho ted ua a^,,iu, and S'i?. p also.\" This memorandum, though brief and imperfect, shews, as on many other occasion of a similar nature, that the horrors of a death beyond imagination had been lightened by the only consolation man could have in such an hour, and that whilst the men were passing through the fiery furnace they had with them One greater than they, who alone could solace and console. This appalling catastrophe aroused the benevolent and charitable feelings of the country to an extent never paralleled in spontaneity and magnifi cence by any purely local calamity. Everywhere, from one end of the country to the other, in rural hamlets as well as crowded cities, a consoling sympathy with the destitute, and a substantial desire to alleviate their sufferings and provide for their necessities, was manifested. The queen also gave freely, and accompanied the gift with the expression of feelings, which, next to the relief of absolute destitution, are the most acceptable balm to the wounded and bleeding heart The Common Council of the city of London laid aside its rules of action to give 100 guineas. The London Coal Exchange felt a personal interest in the matter, and promptly subscribed 1,000 guineas. The brokers in Mincing-lane and Lloyd's also made large contributions. In this district individual smypathy and well-doing was all but universal, and each vied with the other in liberality. Public meetings were held in Newcastle,"], [408, "396 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1862. Tynemouth, Morpeth, Hexham, Blyth, and other places, with a promptitude wdiich showed that the interest felt in the destitute condition of the bereaved population was not cold or conventional but heartfelt and cordial. These public manifestations of sympathy in this district were followed by others in London, Manchester, and other places, and a noble fund, worthy of a Christian nation, was raised for the objects of the general solicitude. On the 26th the last sad phase of this fearful tragedy was completed by the bodies being solemnly interred in the silent grave ; and so great was the number of persons and vehicles composing the procession that, although Earsdon Church is four miles from New Hartley, the first rough hearse had arrived at the church before the last had left the colliery. The burial ground attached to the parish church at Earsdon was totally inadequate to the extraordinary requirements made upon it, and provision had consequently to be made outside the church-yard for nearly the whole of the bodies. The ground for the purpose was given by His Grace the Duke of Northumber land. After the bodies had been laid in the graves, there were sorrowing friends anxiously inquiring the exact spot at which were laid those for whom they mourned ; and the tender flower and gloomy cypress, planted by the hand and watered with the tear of affection, will bloom there when the memory of those who sleep peacefully beneath shall have passed away from the earth. 1862 (January 21/ \u2014 Died, at Thropton, near Rothbury, aged ninety, William Scott. \" Wills\" peculiarities through life stamped him as a character in Coquetdale. The originality of his mind and shrewdness of his remarks, made him quite a celebrity in his native parish of Rothbury Bom at Great Tosson, where his father lived in the service of the late Mr. Samuel Donkin, as drover and feeder of the Tosson Foxhounds, \" Will\" became early initiated into the excitable pleasures of the chase. His highest ambition was in the possession of a breed of terriers, which, like Dandie Dinmont's, \" seared naething that ever cam wi' a hairy skin on't.\" He gloried in a \" bag\" fox, more than C\u00e6sar with the senate at his heels. A portrait in the possession of Walter Selby, esq., of Eiddlestou, representing \" Will'' and his terriers, with a bag over his shoulders containing a sly captive from the strong earths of the \"Key Heugh,\" or the \"old stells,\" is worth engraving. He was ignorant of the alphabet, owing to the high resolve of his father that none of his family should ever be hanged for forgery, yet his estimation of mankind, and his criticisms of the manners of the world, were as forcible as correct, and as witty as deserved. Of all the medals of merit, that of Father Matthew's was viewed by \"Will\" as one ofthe lowest intrinsic value. Early closing belonged not to his customs, nor to his philosophy. Being, one day after the fair, as jovial as usual, he was met by an acquaintance upon \"Beggar's Rigg,\" who asked what would Martha (Scott's truthful and good-natured wife) say to him for stopping so long? \"Aye, but what would she have said if a' had gaen hame ony suiner ?\" was the honest retort."], [409, "A.D. 1862.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 397 1862 (February 7 ). \u2014 This morning an accident occurred on the goods line, opposite the Stockton aud Darlington Railway Station, by which George Bell, one of the goods train guards, was killed. He was engaged in coupling trucks, when, at a mistaken signal, the engine was put in motion suddenly, and he was caught between the buffers, and so severely injured, that he sell dead into the arms of a man who had approached to aid him. February 21. \u2014 The sale of the late Mr. Garnett's library terminated this day, when about 200 lots of well-selected music and musical instruments rapidly passed under the hammer of the auctioneer. The more important lots realized high prices, Sykes' Local Records, with continuation, 3 vols., boards, brought \u00a32 6s. ; Richardson's Table Book, complete in parts, \u00a32 16s.; Mackenzies' History of Newcastle, 2 vols, \u00a36 ; Captain Bailie's Etchings, \u00a311 ; &c, &c. February 26. \u2014 This afternoon an accident of a fatal nature occurred on the Blyth and Tyne Railway, near Prospect Hill. It appeared that two travelling Jews, one a glazier and the other a jeweller, named Mark Moses, were coming down the line, when a train of laden coal waggons, not heard by the two men, struck down Moses, and passing over his body, literally severed it in twain. March 29. \u2014 An alarming accident occurred at Seaham Colliery, which might have been attended with a greater loss of life than the Hartley calamity, had there not been means of exit by another pit. It appeared that while a tub was being brought to bank, the rope broke, and the tub dashed against the brattice work, carrying away it and masses of stone, by which the shaft became completely choked up. There were at the time between 300 and 400 men and boys in the pit, and about 70 ponies. The ingress of the air being stopped, and the smoke aud stythe accumulating below, the men became alarmed, and at once made their way to a communication, which, fortunately, had only been recently formed with the Seaton pit, by which means they were all speedily rescued. But for this communication they all would have perished, as it was asserted by the men, that they could not have lived two hours in the pit for the stythe caused by the shaft being blocked up. May 10. \u2014 A shocking fratricide was committed in the neigh bourhood of Newcastle about midnight. A party of men, living near to St. Peter's Quay, had been drinking at the Grapes public house, St. Peter's, wben a quarrel took place between two of them, named John Berry and Henry Shafto. It appeared in the struggle that Berry had been using a knife, and on his brother, George Scott Berry, going up to him to get him home, he struck him such a blow with the knife in the lower part of the body that death was almost instantaneous. Berry was tried for manslaughter at the ensuing assizes, and sentenced to eight years' penal servitude. May 20. \u2014 This evening one of the most interesting meetings ever convened in the North of England took place in the New Town Hall, Newcastle, sor the purpose of presenting to the noble men who worked in the shaft at Hartley New Colliery during the"], [410, "398 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1862. time of the great calamity with the testimonials raised by public subscription for them.

About 3 p.m. the wind became perfectly still, and the air seemed surcharged with electricity. Dark and heavy clouds made their dismal appearance, and suddenly overhung the Simonside Hills. In a short time the twilight gloom was vividly illuminated, at frequent intervals, by the awful grandeur of the forked flashing of the electric fluid, followed by the most terrific peals of thunder. The rain came down in whole sheets, and all the small rivu'ets in the district suddenly rose with wild impetuosity: In some places the fall of hail was most extraordinary. At Long Framlington the thatched housetops presented a most singular appearance, at this season of the year, by being covered witn snow, and the little urchins sportive'y engaged, were peicing each other with snowballs.

He rolled a little out of the way of the horses, but the fore and hind wheels of the omnibus passed over his head. Horn picked up the body, which was quite dead.

On this occasion, the husband, who was blind, had been drinking at the No rth- terra je Hotel, and the wife having followed him, a quarrel took place. They struggled and sell together on the flags, the wise being undermost, when he struck her on the back of the head with its fists, knocked her head on the flags, and, the injuries she received, caused her death. Tyzack was tried for manslaughter, before Baron Wild, at the ensuing Newcastle Assizes, when Septimus Rayne, surgeon, swore that the fatal wound was caused by a blow, and could not have been caused by a fall upon a hard body. The judge in summing up, said, \"It would have been better if the surgeon, who had appeared before them, had given his evidence a little more modestly. He might, even if he had been a man of high talent, have said that he expected to find an abrasion of the skin in a blow on the curbstone, and not have sworn positively that death could not have been caused by a fall, because our own common sense told us that that might have caused it.\" The jury immediately acquitted the prisoner. June 80. \u2014 This evening, about half past nine o'clock, Mr. Crawshay, of the firm of Hawks, Crawshay, and Co., Gateshead, hooked a trout, with fly, opposite Haughton Castle, in the North Tyne, and landed hm on the following morning, about half-past three, after a struggle of six hours duration. He was upwards of 41bs. in weight, and a true burn trout. Mr. Anthony and Mr. Thomas Armstrong, of Chipchase Mill, spent tho night with Mr. Crawshay, and contributed to his success, carry ing a lantern and landing the fish. His strength was prodigious, and he fought hard to the very last. July 30. \u2014 As the Marco Polo steamer was returning with a trip from Stockton the captain observed, on nearing Sunderland harbour, a boat floating out to sea. He steamed towards the boat, and, on reaching it, he was horror stricken to find the body of a young man lying in the bottom, quite dead. The body was brought into the harbour, and was discovered to be that of John Calvert,"], [412, "400 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1862. an assistant in the employment of Messrs. Humphrey and Evans, grocers, High-street, Sunderland. It was supposed the deceased had taken a fit 1862 (August 7 ). \u2014 This morning, about half-past six o'clock, the Newcastle steamer was coming up the Tyne, and when near the Mushroom, the mate, Mr. John Collingwood, observing a man in the water, leaped overboard and got him into the boat. The deceased's name was William Anderson, formerly minister of the Scotch Church at Denny, from which he had been a short time deposed. Since that time he had been travelling about, and for the few days previous had been Jiving at the Charles the XII. Inn, Bridge-end, Newcastle. He was a single man, tall, powerful looking and between thirty and forty years of age. Whether his death was the result of accident or intentional suicide was never ascertained. August 9. \u2014 This evening Sir William Armstrong gave an entertainment to the members of the Elswick Engine Works Literary and Mechanics' Institute, at his new banquet hall, Jesmond. About 270 members sat down to a most excellent tea, together with a plentiful supply of beef, which rendered it a most substantial repast. Amongst the company present were the Rev. William Maughan, Mr. John Hancock, Mr. Albany Hancock, Mr. W. D. Cruddas, Captain Noble, Mr. Stables, the Misses Hancock, &c. Sir William went round the company and exhibited a very beautiful piece of mechanism. It was a small box three or four inches long, which wound up at the bottom. On opening the lid a beautiful and very diminutive bird, with plumage resembling the birds of Paradise, stood in the centre of the box, shook its wings, moved its head, and, after singing for a minute or two, disappeared. Sir William, in acknowledging a vote of thanks, said \" It had given him very great satisfaction to see them enjoy themselves, and he hoped it would not be the last pleasant evening they would spend in that room.\" The company then took their leave, the band playing the \" Keel Row\" on their way to the town. August 10. \u2014 A most atrocious and cold-blooded murder was perpetrated early this morning, at a place called Broadmires, five miles north of Durham. The victim was an old woman named Ann HaUiday, about 80 years of age. The deceased was a married woman, but separated from her husband, who kept a public house in the neighbourhood. The murderers were an Irishman and his wife, named John Cox and Mary Cox, who lived next door, and were the first themselves to give information of the murder. The deceased, when discovered, was upon the floor of her cottage, and a coalrake and poker, smeared with blood, were lying beside her. They were tried at the ensuing Durham Assizes, before Mr. Justice Keating, convicted and sentenced to be hung. John Cox was executed on the 23rd of December; his wife was respited, owing to her being in a state of pregnancy. August 20.\u2014 This afternoon a boy, named David Fittes, 13 years of age, was killed in a quarry. The deceased was a shoe-"], [413, "A.D. 1862.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 401 maker, and resided with his uncle, James Sessford, Hindhaugh street, Barrack-road. Near Hindhaugh-street there is a quarry, belonging to Mr. John Robson, where a number of men were engaged in taking out the stone. The deceased had passed the men, and had gone down a hole into an old pit working, and was in the act of taking out some coals when one of the old props gave way, and a large stone fell upon him and killed him on the spot. 1862 (August 29/ \u2014 This evening the friends of the Rev. Sharp Weeks, for ten years curate of St. Paulas Church, High Elswick, Newcastle, met in St. Mary's School Room, Rye-hill, and presented him with a purse, containing one hundred guineas, and a splendid silver inkstand. September 2. \u2014 This afternoon Thomas Pigg, landlord of the Lord Collingwood Inn, Felling, met with an untimely death. The deceased took a gun out of the house, saying that he was going into the stable to shoot rats. Shortly after his departure the report of a gun was heard, and on the domestics proceeding to the stable they found the deceased lying dead, the contents of the gun having been discharged into his mouth, and shattered his head severely. The deceased had been formerly a tailor in Newcastle, and bad lost his wife only a short time previous. Whether this sad event was the result of accident or intention was not discovered. September 5 \u2014 A serious accident occurred at Monkwearmouth Colliery, accompanied with the loss of five lives. It appeared that about 100 fathoms from the mouth of the shaft a commencement had been made to wall the sides of the pit, the men working upon a \" cradle,\" suspended by six chains to a tremendously strong rope attached to an engine, by which the \" cradle\" could be moved up and down as the work progressed. Earlv this morning, as five men were at work on the '\u2022 cradle,\" the scaffold above the 1 80 fathom drift suddenly gave way, and with a fearful noise went down the pit. A tremendous rush of air down the shaft immediately followed; and so strong was the suction upon the \"cradle\" that four of the six chains gave way, the \" cradle\" canted to one side, and the five men were plunged into the frightful abyss. Their names were Robert Dryden, James Hall, David Mason, Robert Lamb, and Charles Wright. September 9. \u2014 Died, suddenly, at Bath House, Newcastle, aged 51, William Dunn, esq. It appeared that about seven o'clock in the morning he was seized with a severe spasm whilst in bed, and his medical man, Mr. S. W. Rayne, was sent for, who administered to him some medicine, which appeared to relieve him, aud he was accordingly left alone in bed. About eleven o'clock, however, when one of the inmates entered the room, Mr. Dunn was found to be lifeless. Death had evidently occurred some time before, the cause of which was supposed to he disease of the heart. Deceased was the son of the late Mr. Alderman Dunn, of Bath House, and had in early life been educated at the Roman Catholic College at Ushaw. He was afterwards articled as an attorney to Mr. John Clayton, and studied for the legal profession, and eventually he VOL. III. D 2"], [414, "402 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1862. became a partner in the firm of Messrs. Clayton, Newcastle. His partnership with those gentlemen was dissolved in the year 1853, and he had since that time been in business on his own account. He had been some years a director of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and was intimately associated with the late Matthew Plummer, esq., who so long and ably fulfilled the duties of chair man of the company. The mortal remains of the deceased were interred at Jesmond Cemetery on the 16th, according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. 1862 (September 13/\u2014 The workmen under Mr. Anthony Hall, locomotive superintendent of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and a large number of his friends, including several ladies, met in the Waggon Shop, Railway-street, Scotswood-roud, and presented him with a handsome testimonial. The workshop was tastefully decorated, a temporary platform being erected and surrounded with evergreens and flowers, while banners was suspended around the walls. Mr. Daniel Dunn occupied the chair, and on the plat form were Captain Woods, chairman of the company, Mr. Haswell, of the Gateshead Railway Shops, Mr Pringle, &c. The chairman said it might be asked why they were presenting Mr. Hall with a testimonial. The answer was that the workmen had for weeks, months, and years thought that some mark of their esteem should be given, and there could not be a better opportunity than the present, when the line was changing bands, lie was exceedingly glad that Mr. Woods was to present the testimonial, and he called upon that gentleman, who, in performing the duty imposed upon him, stated that Mr. Hall had given perfect satisfaction to the Board of Directors during the 27 years he had been in the employ of the Carlisle Company, and had shown himself an able, indepen dent man. Mr. Woods then read the following, inscribed on a silver tea service: \u2014 \"Presented to Mr. Anthony Hall, together with a gold watch and chain and a purse of gold, by the workmen under his charge, and a number of his friends, as a mark of esteem, and hi testimony of his private worth as locomotive superintendent ofthe Newcastle and Carlisle Railway during a period of 27 years. September, 1862.\" Mr. Hall briefly, but feelingly, responded. He said he had been 31 years connected with railways; four had been spent on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and the remainder they all knew. September 13. \u2014 This evening a sad occurrence took place in the east part of Newcastle. Charles Ridley, a young man, residing in Blandford-street, Westgate, had been at Byker shooting ground and was returning home, when, as was his custom, he called at the house of a companion named James Rendall, a married man, residing in Gibson-street. On going into the room he put a cap on the rifle, and said to Rendall, \"Jim, I'll shoot you.\" Rendall replied, \" Mind what you are doing, that's not made to be played with.\" Ridley fired, and, to his astonishment, discovered that he had actually shot his friend. Rendall was immediately taken to the Infirmary, where it was found that the bullet had entered his"], [415, "A.D. 1862.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 403 right side, penetrating his bowels, passing out at the left side into the lower part of his arm, and coming out at the elbow joint. The explanation of the sad affair is said to have been that Ridley having fired oft* the whole of his ammunition at Byker, went to examine the target, leaving his rifle behind him. During his absence some one had loaded it in mistake, and when he returned he took it up and proceeded to his friend's house, thinking that it was still unloaded. Rendall, as well as his wife, felt satisfied that it was an accident, and Ridley felt the effects of his thoughtlessness very keenly. 1862 (September 1 7). \u2014 This evening the neighbourhood of Gibson street was thrown into a state of great excitement by the rumour that Mr. Isaac Nixon, cooper and publican, and formerly a member of the Newcastle Town Council, had committed suicide by hanging himself. Mr. Nixon was observed by a neighbour opposite, named Fraser, to be standing in a crooked position. On the servant girl going up stairs she found him in a stooping posture against a chest of drawers, with his necktie fast to one of the handles. On exami nation it was found he was strangled. The deceased was 43 years of age. October 2. \u2014 The long expected ceremony of the inaugura tion of the monument at the Spital, Newcastle, erected by public subscription to the memory of the late George Stephenson, was this day performed with fitting pomp and solemnity.* The monument stands upon the triangle piece of ground at the junction of Neville street and Westgate-street, and a more appropriate spot could not have been selected lor the purpose. The artist was Mr. John Graham Lough, a gentleman intimately connected with this locality, having been born not far from Newcastle. Like Stephenson, Mr. Lough had risen from the ranks, and his fame as a sculptor was almost as erreat as that of Stephenson as an engineer. The monument is erected upon a square plinth, gradually diminishing from the base to the apex, with frosted masonry, at an elevation of about 10 or 11 feet. There are four figures, one at each corner, by which the sculptor has endeavoured to symbolise the pursuits of the great engineer. They consist of a pitman, a blacksmith, an engineer, and a platelayer. The statue, which faces the south-east, is not only a splendid work of art, but a faithful portrait of the great engineer. The total height of the monument, from the base to the top of the statue, is about 31 feet. It was evident from an early hour, that something extraordinary was about to take place in Newcastle. All the signs of an ordinary business day were wanting, and in their place the usual tokens of festivity everywhere abounded. The bells of the old churches pealed forth their merry notes, carrying with them to all old residents many recollections of past days of pleasure and excitement, all of which, however, were to be eclipsed by that which had now dawned. The monument committee met in the New Town Hall, at one o'clock. Shortly after that hour the corporations of this and surrounding towns began to * For a brief sketch of the Career of George Stephenson, see page 3(33,"], [416, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1862. 404 assemble, and, on the arrival of Lord Ravensworth \u2014 whose province it was to uncover the statue \u2014 the company at once proceeded to the large hall. His lordship then called upon Alderman I. L. Bell, the treasurer of the monument committee, to marshal the proces sion, which he accordingly did, and it left the Town Hall at the appointed time ; and such a procession as was then seen, or rather imagined, for it was impossible to see the whole of it at once, had perhaps never before been witnessed in Newcastle. On the van of the procession, which numbered upwards of 12,000, making its appearance at the end of Collingwood-street, Lord Ravensworth, the Rev. the Vicar, Mr. Lough, the members of the committee, and the other leading persons entered the barricaded enclosure. Sud denly a sound rung clear and distinct above tbe hum of the vast multitude, the flap of the flags, and the sound of the distant bands. It was the signal given by the bugle for the uncovering of the monument, and in a moment every eye was turned towards the great canvas tent beneath which it was decorated. As the last note of the bugle sounded the curtained opened in front, flew back on either side simultaneously, and in a moment fell, revealing the monument in all its beauty to the eyes of the spectators. As the noble form of George Stephenson met the gaze of the immense multitude, a thrill ot enthusiasm ran through every heart, and a great cheer rising from every throat rent the air, as it hailed the illustrious peasant-bom hero. The scene presented at this moment was wonderfully impressive. From the windows of many of the houses and public buildings in all the principal thoroughfares banners of various hues fluttered in the breeze ; strings of flags were drawn across the streets leading to the spot forming triumphal arches, and whenever the eye turned it encountered nothing but crowds\u2014 crowds in the streets, crowds in the windows, and crowds on the house-tops, church steeples, and every available spot. In St. John's Churchyard a substantial platform had been erected, which was filled with ladies. Happily no \" melancholy Jacques\" was present to mar the pleasures of the scene by uttering sombre truths, so the spectacle of a \" garden of girls\" in a graveyard was allowed to pass unnoticed . All round the barriers, stretching as far as the eye could reach, in every direction, there lay a surging sea of heads, hats, and faces, while over all there was the smiling sky, blue and beautiful. The Rev. the Vicar of Newcastle having offered up a prayer, the Right Hon. Lord Ravensworth then stood forward and delivered a most eloquent address in reference to the object of the day's proceedings, a passage from which is worth recording \u2014 \" The early part of George Stephenson's life may be paralleled to a small candle glimmering in the midst of darkness and obscurity, a light which the most casual breath of air or the merest blast of mephitic vapour might have extinguished at any moment, whereas, in the zenith of his career, he may, without exaggeration, be likened to the meridian sun, whose blaze shone forth with an unparalleled lustre over the whole of Europe. Over the whole of Europe did I say % Why, gentlemen, I might have"], [417, "A.D. 1862.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 405 included the limits of the whole civilized world. Europe would be far too narrow a limit to circumscribe the operations which have resulted from the genius of that mau (pointing to the statue). We see the iron road sweeping over the wild and vast prairies of America, the primeval forest of the great part of that yet unculti vated and uncivilized world. We see the ponderous locomotive and the rushing train traversing' the desert sands of Egypt, and making its way through the most difficult parts of our Indian Empire, and, if the same progress be made in the next quarter of a century that has distinguished the last, I do not hesitate to say that many of you may yet live to see the barriers of the great wall of China thrown down before those advancing trains, which carry with them the civilization, the virtues, and the benefits of humanity and commerce.\" In the evening a public dinner was held in the Royal Turf Hotel in celebration of the event. Between fifty and sixty gentlemen sat down to the repast, which was of the most elegant description. The chair was occupied by John Fairbairn, esq., and the vice-chair by John A. Haswell, esq.

Patti, and the troupe of talented musicians by whom she was accompanied. Previous to the concert every seat in the reserved places had been secured, and all other parts of the hall were also fully occupied. The appearance of the hall, brilliantly lighted and filled with fashionably dressed ladies, was beautiful in the extreme. The piece set down for Madlle. Patti was the aria from the Barber of Seville, \" Unco voce poco fa,\" and the way in which it was sung justified the eagerness with which it had been anticipated. Then came the famous \" Swiss Echo Song,\" sung by Madlle. Patti. She accepted an enthusiastic encore, and sang \" Within a mile of Edinbro' toun\" with a naivette and pathos which raised the enthusiasm of the audience to the highest pitch, and a profusion of"], [418, "406 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1862. bouquets were laid at the feet of the youthful enchantress. Alto gether, the concert, both in respect to merit in the performers and excellence of selection of pieces, was one of the best held in Newcastle, and the public were deeply indebted to Mr. Hare for his spirit and enterprise in bringing such a vast and varied array of musical talent before an audience of the town and neighbourhood. 1862 (October 11/ \u2014 An extraordinary case of poisoning occurred at North Shields. Mrs. Jane Gilhespie, wife of Mr. Gilhespie, ship captain, Wellington-street, had been ailing for some time, and was attended by Dr. Fenwick, who prescribed for her complaint \u2014 1 grain of antimony, 1 ounce of sulph. mag., otherwise Epsom Salts, 8 ounces of aqua pura, and spirit colouring. By inadvertence, carelessness, or some other cause, which was never properly explained, strychnia had been introduced into the mixture, which caused Mrs. Gilhespie's death in less than two hours after having taken a portion. Dr. Fenwick's certificate as to the cause of death was stated thus : \u2014 \" Cause of Death, Bronchitis, Congestion of the Lungs; Time from attack to death, two years one day.\" Mr. Gilhespie not being satisfied about the medicine, gave a portion of the remainder to a cat, and it died in less than ten minutes. A long and searching investigation took place, which ended in an open verdict, but during the enquiry the evidence was anything but creditable to the medical gentleman connected with the case. Dr. Fenwick was afterwards threatened with a civil action, but he ultimately compromised the matter by paying Mr. Gilhespie \u00a3500. October 19. \u2014 A hurricane of wind and rain, of appalling violence, raged in this district. Commencing, about ten o'clock, with a strong south-east wind, it gradually grew in force until midnight, when its fury was something terrible to behold, far eclipsing, as it did, the violence of any similar storm that had taken place for many years past. At the time the hurricane was at its height the scene, revealed by the dim light of the stars, was an awful one. The noise of the wind, as it rushed down the various streets, and forced its way into the interior of every building, was tremendous. Those who had the misfortune to be abroad at the time were scarcely able to keep their footing. All who occupied houses in exposed situations found their dwellings \u2014 even when built in the most substantial manner \u2014 shook at every blast as if from an earthquake, whilst the wind roaring down the chimneys produced a sound like the discharge of artillery. Every moment slates, torn sometimes singly, and sometimes in patches from the roofs, were dashed into the streets beneath, often mingling in the air with chimney pots doomed to a similar fate, whilst, occasionally, the scene was pleasantly diversified by the fall, with a tremendous crash, of some unfortunate stack of chimneys, or some badly built house gable. It would be impossible to enumerate all the disasters which occurred in this neighbourhood during the storm, the destruction to property being enormous. The shipping in the Tyne also suffered severely, and all throughout Northumberland and Durham the hurricane raged with unexampled fury."], [419, "A.D. 1863.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 407 1862 (November 1 0/ \u2014 The election of mayors for this district took place this day with the following result : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 I.

Walker Colliery is the property of the Corporation of Newcastle, but it had been leased for a long period to a company of gentlemen amongst whom were Mr. N. G. Lambert and the Messrs. Jobling. November 26. \u2014 A most fearful accident took place at the farmstead of Mr. Barber, Rock Moor House, near Alnwick. They had been thrashing com, and a condensing engine was employed for driving the machinery. The weather being very cold, several young men and women had gathered around the fire in the engine house, and Mr. Pallister, the steward, had just shouted to the lads and girls that it was time to commence work, when the boiler exploded, and brought the whole building down with a tremendous crash to the ground. Six of the persons inside were killed on the spot, and two died shortly afterwards. Nine others were seriously injured. December 20. \u2014 A melancholy event occurred iu the total loss of the screw steamship Lifeguard, one of the passenger steam boats between London and Newcastle. She left the Tyne this afternoon bound for London, with a crew of 22 persons and 35 passengers, and a general cargo. She was passed on the same day off Scarbro' by the Pioneer. It was theu blowing a terrific gale from the N W., and a tremendous sea was running. On the 23nd, a box was picked up by the ship Idra and taken into Bridlington. It was found to contain some poultry and Christmas presents, to gether with some letters written by parties in Newcastle. The box was sent by Miss Rowell, of Newcastle, in whose seminary Miss Stephens, one of the passengers, was a governess, to a friend in London, and the letters accompanying the box led to the identity of the Lifeguard. The crew of the Idra found the box floating among some wreck, consisting of ship's furniture, &c, and, there is no doubt that the Lifeguard had foundered in the vicinity. She was a splendid vessel, and, with her cargo, worth \u00a320,000. She was the property of W. D. Stephens, esq., Newcastle. 1863 (January 1). \u2014 Early this morning a most revolting and atrocious murder was perpetrated at the West Walls, Newcastle. About two o'clock three young lads perceived a young man, named George Vass, dragging a woman by the hair of the head up the dark and lonely lane, where the body was afterwards found frightfully mutilated. The name of the unfortunate woman was Margaret Docherty, the wife of a tailor, who then lived in Buckingham street. The disgusting details of this brutal atrocity are altogether"], [420, "408 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1863. unfit for publication. Dr- Rayne, in his evidence at the inquest, stated that he had never seen a human being so mutilated except by a machine. Vass was tried at the ensuing assizes, before Baron Martin, sentenced to be hung, and was executed on the 16th March following. 1863 (January 8/ \u2014 A number of ballast waggons, with an engine attached, were being loaded with stone blocks, at the Wylam Station, by several men, amongst whom was Joseph Reay, a brother of the station master at Prudhoe. While the train was in motion, Reay and another man were sitting on the edge of one of the trucks talking together. Owing to a sudden jerk on the line, Reay was thrown off the waggon on to the buffers, and from thence he fell between the waggons, and one of the wheels passed over his neck, nearly severing his head from his body. Death was instantaneous. January 17. \u2014 This morning Mr. John Tinn was killed at the Elswick Ordnance Works. The deceased was a millwright, working in No. 26 shop. After breakfast he was seen working near a hole, which was caused by the boards in the floor having been taken up to oil the machinery. William Culley, a young man, saw the deceased's cap lying, and he asked the oilman where he thought the deceased was. They looked about, and on looking down the hole they beheld him in a most frightful condition. The engines were stopped, and the deceased was speedily extricated, but he was quite dead. February 3. \u2014 Sir Hedworth Williamson, bart., of Whitburn Hall, near Sunderland, was married at Lamesley Church, to his cousin, the Hon. Elizabeth Jane Hay Liddell, third daughter of Lord Ravensworth. The marriage was celebrated with great rejoicings at Ravensworth Castle, Lamesley, Whittingham, and Glanton. February 4. \u2014 A fire broke out in the Half Moon Inn, Wooler, and before its destructive rage could be arrested a great number of dwelling houses were laid in ruins. It appeared that a chimney in the Half Moon had taken fire, and communicated the devouring element to the roof, which was of thatch, many of the adjoining buildings being covered with the same inflammable material. The greatest consternation prevailed in the town, as house after house was destroyed by the fire, which was fanned by the hurricane of wind that prevailed at the time. The fire at last was got under, but not until sixteen houses and shops were destroyed. Many families were rendered both houseless and homeless by the calamity. February 10.\u2014 This morning the shop of Mr. Pilkington, bookseller and stationer, Marlborough-street, Scotswood-road, Newcastle, was visited by a bull, which walked leisurely in, admired some photographs on the wall, and, though surrounded by articles of vertu on all sides, contrived to turn himself round and make his exit, much to tbe satisfaction of the occupant of the shop and astonishment of the bystanders, who evidently expected a scene."], [421, "A.D. 1863.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 409 1863 (February 13/ \u2014 An alarming fire broke out this morning, on the premises of Messrs. J. and E. Richardson, the well-known tanners, Newgate-street, Newcastle, by which property to an immense amount was destroyed, and about 100 work people thrown out of employment for a considerable time. The damage was estimated at \u00a330,000. February 18. \u2014 A painful case of suicide occurred in the city of Durham. A young man, named Thomas Clark, brother to Miss Clark, the keeper of the Market Hotel in that city, whilst in a fit of passion, deliberately put an end to his existence, by leaping into the river Wear from Framwellgate Bridge, an elevation of about 70 feet. The body was got out in a few minutes afterwards, but all efforts at resuscitation were found to be unavailing. March 6. \u2014 This morning another of those dreadful colliery explosions, which are constantly occurring in this district, took place at Coxlodge, by which nineteen men and boys lost their lives. The pit, along with many others in the neighbourhood, including the one at Burradon, at which seventy-sour men and boys recently lost their lives, is the property of Joshua Bower, esq., of Leeds, and has long been celebrated for its excellent household coals. It is about 95 fathoms deep, has two shafts, and its workings extend several miles underground. One of the most remarkable things in connection with this sad occurrence was the very slight amount of attention, on the part of the public, which it had attracted. The inhabitants of this district seemed to have had their appetites for horrors of this description completely surfeited, and the consequence was, that the scene of the calamity had scarcely been visited by anyone, nor had the catastrophe caused a sensation even in the immediate neighbourhood of the spot. March 10. \u2014 This day the whole kingdom united in celebrating, in a becoming manner, the marriage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Her Royal Highness the Princess Alexandra of Denmark ; and the demonstrations of affectionate and exuberant loyalty which were then made were such as are unparalleled in the history of this country. Never before, in the annals of the House of Brunswick, did the people testify, with enthusiasm and such spontaneity, their affection and regard for their royal rulers. In every city, town, and hamlet of Great Britain \u2014 in the palace of the duke and the cottage of the peasant \u2014 some demonstration of goodwill and loyalty were made. In the ancient town of Newcastle the same wild enthusiasm was manifested. Day was ushered in with the firing of cannon from the Shot Tower, Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay's, and other well-known places. Then followed the merry peals of the church bells, so that soon the air was full of joyous sounds. From a very early hour in the morning the streets presented an appearance of great gaiety. Every little thoroughfare was adorned in some way or other. Many private houses had flags flying from tbe roofs and windows, while the drapery estab- lishments in our larger streets were resplendent with bunting of every hue. The flags of all nations floated from every projection, YOL III. e 2"], [422, "410 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1863. and England and Denmark were brought into every variety of juxtaposition. At the Monument a beautiful effect was produced by strings of banners being suspended from the top of that lofty column to the roofs of the neighbouring buildings. Grainger street, Clayton-street, Westgate-street, Neville -street, Collingwood street, Mosley-street, and Pilgrim-street were all decorated with a profusion of flags, while Grey-street alone had displayed more than were to be seen in all London on the day the Exhibition was opened. The illuminations at night were of the most splendid description, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the weather, the people in the crowded slushy streets seemed to enjoy the exhibition in the greatest good humour. The great feature of the day was the monster procession, which consisted of the various Rifle and Volunteer Corps connected with the district, the trades' guilds, lodges, and other civic bodies, which had a most imposing effect as it marched through the town. During the day the horses of Messrs. Carver and Co., railway agents, perambulated the streets, drawing after them the waggons, carts, &c, belonging to the firm. The first large waggon was drawn by eight powerful greys, the next one by eight equally splendid chesnuts. The magnificent condition of the animals called forth from all extreme admiration and praise. And what with balls, dinners, fireworks, and other amusements, the town was kept in a state of bewildering excitement till the short hours in the following morning At Gateshead, Tynemouth, North and South Shields, Durham, Sunderland, Alnwick, Hexham, Morpeth, and all throughout the counties of Northumberland and Durham, the same enthusiastic loyalty was exhibited. 1863 (March 14/ \u2014 A sow, belonging to Mr. J. J. M. Forster, farmer, of Longhoughton, near Alnwick, had a litter of no less than 23 pigs, all alive. March 15. \u2014 Mr. Peter Forsyth, one of the foreman of the Felling Chemical Works, and who also held the rank of sergeant of the Felling Volunteer Rifle Corps, had five of his children christened at Windy Nook Church, by the Rev. E. M. Adamson, and named respectively Elizabeth, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel. April 11. \u2014 A Cheviot ewe, the property of Mr. James Kidd, of Rothbury, dropped eight lambs within ten months and eleven days, four at a time. This, if not unprecedented, is certainly a most extraordinary case. May 7. \u2014 Mr. James Joicey, the well-known coalowner of Newcastle, died, in an awfully sudden manner at his offices, Commercial Buildings Quayside. On leaving his residence, at Walker-terrace, Gateshead, he proceeded to the Exchange News Rooms, Sandhill, where he conversed with Alderman Nichol and several other gentlemen, and appeared to be in the enjoyment of his usual health. Thence he proceeded to his offices on the Quay, and complained to one of the clerks of feeling sick, and almost imme diately after he fell from his seat to the floor in a fit. A messenger was immediately despatched for medical assistance, and in a very short time Drs. Donkin and Gregson arrived simultaneously, They"], [423, "A.D. 1863.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 411 found the unfortunate gentleman insensible and in a dying state and, though they made an attempt to bleed him, they were unable to afford him any relief, and in about ten minutes alter their arrival he expired. In order that Mr. Joicey's body might at once be removed to his own residence, the medical gentlemen signed a certificate as to the cause of his death, which they discovered was a violent attack of apoplexy. When the sad event became known upon the Quayside, it caused considerable excitement amongst the merchants, to all of whom Mr. Joicey was well known. Deceased was connected with the management of the South Tanfield, Tan- field Moor, Butes Tanfield Moor, West Pelaw, New Pelton, Lady Windsor's Tanfield, Beamish, and South Pontop Collieries, and he was the head of the firm of Messrs. J. and G. Joicey and Co., engineers, Forth-banks, Newcastle. He was, in the common phrase of the day, a \" self-made man,\" having arisen originally from very humble circumstances, entirely by his own industry and ability, to the possession of considerable wealth. He was greatly respected by all who came in contact with him, and his loss was severely felt by a large circle of friends. His remains were interred in the lamily vault, at Tanfield, on the 1 Ith. 1863 (May 30/ \u2014 Died, at his residence, Hood-street, Newcastle, aged 45, Mr. William Newton, surgeon. While riding on the Town Moor, on the 10th of April, Mr. Newton was thrown from his horse and received the injuries which occasioned his death. The unfortunate gentleman, in his tall, came in contact with a stone, and the immediate result was the fracture of the spine. He was removed to the Herd's Cottage, in the immediate neighbour hood, and thence to his own house, where the injury to the spine gave rise to sympathetic inflammatory symptoms, which was ulti- mately the cause of death. During his illness he had the sympathy and kindly wishes of his fellow townsmen, of all shades of opinion, and if anything were wanted to show the high public appreciation of him, it would be sound in the anxiety of the public to learn his condition, not merely from day to jday, but irom hour to hour. From the first, however, there was no hope that his life would be spared, and the public had been in some degree prepared for the melancholy event. The funeral obsequies took place on the 3rd of June, at Jesmond Cemetery, in the presence of many hundreds of his sorrowing friends and fellow townsmen. June 10. \u2014 Mr. Robert Wallace, surveyor to the Corporation of Newcastle, expired in an awfully sudden manner, this morning. He was proceeding round the corner of the Sandhill, apparently in his usual health, and, when in front ol Mr. O. Young's shop, he was observed to stagger and fall backwards. He was imme diately conveyed to Sir John File's surgery, where he almost instantaneously. Mr. Wallace was 73 years of age. June 16.\u2014 The great aquatic contest, for the championship of the world, between Robert Chambers, of Newcastle, and R. A. W. Green, of Australia, took place to-day, on the Thames. The race was of surpassing interest, and its issue excited all"], [424, "412 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1863. England. When the men had really commenced the race, it was apparent that the rumours of Green's fast rowing had not been exaggerated, for he quite outpaced Chambers and went on with such a commanding lead, that the followers of Chambers could scarcely credit what they saw. Chambers, however, pulled with that mechanical motion and freedom for which he was distin guished, and never sor an instant lost his composure. Eis courage served him, and, aster the race, he rightly remarked, \" although I lost the lead, I never lost heart'\" Indomitable in his gameness, he went on with a deliberate and powerful stroke that seemed literally to grasp the water, his arms moving with the precision of a locomotive piston rod. Before a mile had been completed Chambers gradually drew upcn the Australian, and, amidst a scene that will never be forgotten, passed his man with the gradual encroahment of growing strength and stoutness. From this point Green's energies were evidently relaxed. Exhausted and dispirited his stroke became so slow and weak that Chambers placed an im mense distance between himself and his pursuer, and arrived at the winning post five minutes before the Australian. 1863 (June 18). \u2014 Another great boat race was rowed on the Thames, for \u00a3200 aside, between Robert Cooper, of Newcastle, and George Everson, of London, which was easily won by the former. 17th. \u2014 The race between George Drewitt, of London, and Teasdale Wilson, Newcastle, was won by the London man. June 20. \u2014 This morning the inhabitants of Felton were aroused from\"their slumbers by the cry of fire. Mr. Wilson, of the firm of Miller, Wilson, and Rochester, was determined upon having a morning's fishing, and upon looking over the river, he saw fire ascending from the mills. He immediately ran to the place and aroused Mr. Wear and his family. On arriving at the scene the whole range of buildings were in a blaze, and nothing could have saved them. Too much cannot be said in praise of the villagers, for the manner in which they volunteered their services to save whatever was possible, but their efforts were unavailing, everything being destroyed. The damage was estimated at \u00a34,000. June 21. \u2014 This morning a fire of an alarming character broke out in Newcastle, which, at one time, threatened to destroy the whole block of buildings extending from Messrs. John Milling and Co.'s extensive drapery establishment, Grainger-street, to the Bigg-market. It appeared that at about a quarter before one o'clock, the policeman on duty in Grainger-street observed a dense volume of smoke rising from the rear of Messrs. Milling and Co.'s premises. On an examination being made in the Coach and Horses Yard, Bigg-market, it was discovered that the fire had originated in a large warehouse, at the bottom of the above place, occupied by Messrs. Taylor, Gibson, and Co., wholesale druggists. This place being filled with very combustible articles, such as oils of every descripton, brimstone, rice sago, oats, gum, glue, acids, &c, it fell a rapid prey to the devouring elements, and when the fire reached the roof it communicated with Messrs. Milling aud Co.'s"], [425, "A.D. 1863.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 413 premises. Happily, owing to there being a good supply of water, it was speedily subdued, but not until there was a large amount of damage sustained. The greatest loss caused to Messrs. Milling and Co's establishment was by water, which had to be used in quenching the sire at the rear of the premises when the fire first broke out, a considerable quantity of the stock, consisting of silks, &c, being completely saturated with water. Messrs. Taylor, Gibson, and Co. were covered by insurance in the North British Fire Office. 1863 (June 23/ \u2014 The annual carnival of the North of England, the Newcastle Races, commenced this afternoon. The Northum berland Plate was won by Mr. W. I'Anson's br m Caller Ou (Challoner), beating Carbineer, Lothian's King, and twelve others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. J. Osborne's b c The Comet (Whitely), beating Wild Dayrell, Sauterelle, and three others. June 29. \u2014 The election of a member for Berwick-on-Tweed, in the place of the late Captain Gordon, took place to-day. The candidates were Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Cargill. After a severe contest, Mr. Cargill, the Conservative candidate, was returned by a majority of 18 July 23. \u2014 A well-deserved compliment was to-day paid to one of the oldest and best known inhabitants of Northumberland. Mr. John Grey, who for many years had managed the extensive estates of the Greenwich Hospital, having retired in favour of his son, Mr. Charles G. Grey, was entertained at a public dinner at Hexham, when a very large assembly met together for the purpose of expressing their respect and esteem for Mr. Grey, now that, at an advanced age, he was retiring from the active business of life. The chair was occupied by William Stephenson, esq., of Throckley House, and the vice-chairmen were Marshall Stephenson, esq., Fourstones ; Joseph Lee, esq., Dilston ; J. Bolam, esq., and William Benson, esq , Allerwash, In the paragraph respecting the testimonial presented to Mr. Grey, October 9th, 1849, should be added that a full-sized portrait of Mr. Grey, by Patton, at a cost of 100 guineas, was at the same time presented, which was exhibited in London, and afterwards at the New Town Hall, Hexham. August 9.\u2014 This morning Mr. T. Storey, chemist, Pilgrim street, Newcastle, and his two brothers, intended to drive to Ponteland. The conveyance was brought into Pilgrim-street, but owing to the horse being restive, Mr. Storey ordered it to be taken back and put into the stable. Mr. Cryer (Mr. Storey's assistant) and Mr. William Storey, however, seated themselves in the gig, and immediately the horse set off at a rapid pace down Pilgrim street, the occupants of the ph\u00e6ton being unable to check it in its career. When near the Friends' Meeting House, Cryer jumped out and fell, the effects of which rendered him insensible. When near Messrs. Woods and Co.'s Bank Mr. Storey was thrown out, and fractured his knee. A little further down the street a man, named Septimus Slowan, was knocked down and seriously injured."], [426, "414 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1863, The horse continued on its way till it reached All Saints' Church, where its progress was stayed by falling down some steps. Mr. Cryer died a few hours afterwards. 1863 (August 26).\u2014 The meeting of the British Association com menced in Newcastle under most favourable auspices. The first proceedings were the meeting of the sectional committees, at which the officers of the various sections were appointed, and a programme of the papers to be read arranged. The inaugural address was delivered by Sir William G. Armstrong, in the evening, in the New Town Hall, before such an audience as is seldom witnessed in one assemblage. The British Association was established in 1831, aud its object was to bring together men eminent in all the several departments of science, to assist the progress of discovery, and to extend over the whole country the latest results of scientific research. September 1 7. \u2014 An accident of a very alarming character occurred this morning in Elswick-lane, Newcastle, to the conveyance of Mrs. T. C. Angus, Ravensworth-villa, Gateshead, by which that lady and several others were put into great peril. It appeared that Mrs. Angus had been visiting her daughter, Mrs. Edward Culley, of Bentinck- terrace, accompanied by Mrs. Pottinger, (5,wise of the Rev T. Pottinger, Mrs. Davis, Northumberland-street, Miss Barrett and Master Barrett. The whole of this party were in Mrs. Angus's drag, and the driver had removed the horse's bridle to give it a drink, when it took fright and set off down Bentinck-road at a violent gallop. It turned into Elswick-lane and proceeded along until opposite Cromwell-terrace, when the drag was upset, the ladies and Master Barrett being thrown out, several of them being seriously injured Mrs. Pottinger, who had sustained some dangerous internal injuries, was conveyed to the residence of Mrs. Angus, where she died on the 20th. September 18. \u2014 During the week the old pant, which had occupied the centre of the Market-place, Durham, since 1450, was demolished, and Neptune removed from the pedestal he had occupied since 1729, and placed on the summit of a handsome new fountain. September 29. \u2014 A melancholy and fatal accident occurred at Matfen Hall, which resulted in the almost instantaneous death of the estimable lady of Captain Blackett, R.N., of Oakwood House, Wylam. It appeared that Mrs. Blackett had been on a visit to Sir Edward Blackett, bart., in an open ph\u00e6ton, accom panied by two children, drawn by one horse, which was driven by herself. The unfortunate lady was about to return on her home ward journey when the horse became restive and ungovernable. Mrs. Blackett, apprehensive of danger, requested her children to alight, which they succeeded in doing without injury. Immediately afterwards the animal reared, and then dashed off at a furious speed into the wood ; and the conveyance coming in violent contact with a tree, Mrs. Blackett was thrown out, and the vehicle over turned upon her. The gardener, who witnessed the accident,"], [427, "A.D. 1864.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 415 carried her in his arms towards the hall, but Mrs. Blackett expired before he had proceeded many yards. The unfortunate lady was about thirty years of age, and left seven children to mourn her untimely end. The intelligence of the accident cast quite a gloom over the neighbourhood in which she resided, having been deservedly respected and esteemed by all who knew her. 1863 (November 9/ \u2014 The annual election of chief magistrates for the boroughs in Northumberland and Durham took place with the following results: \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Thomas Hedley, esq, mayor; William Hunter, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 George Crawshaw, esq. Tynemouth \u2014 Joseph Spence, esq. South Shields \u2014 Aid. Ridley, esq. Sunderland \u2014 Aid Allison, esq., Durham \u2014 Aid. Robson, esq. Morpeth \u2014 Dr. O'Connor. Berwick \u2014 Aid. Thompson, esq., mayor ; James Allan, esq., sheriff. December 12. \u2014 A frightful accident occurred on the North- Eastern Railway, near Pelaw Main, about five miles from New castle, which resulted in the death of Captain Palmer, a retired naval officer, residing at Monckton, near Jarrow. It appeared that Captain Palmer, who was well known in that locality, was observed by the porter at Pelaw Main Station walking along the line from Sunderland and South Shields. At that time he was not between the rails but a little on one side Whilst the porter was still looking the express, which leaves Sunderland at half past ten, made its appearance, when Mr. Palmer apparently became confused and actually stepped right upon the rails in front of the advancing engine. In^a moment it was upon^him, threw him down, and, before anything could be done to stop it, the whole of the train had passed over him, mangling his body in the most frightful manner, in fact literally cutting it to pieces. The deceased gentleman was about 70 years of age. December 15. \u2014 Early this morning another most disastrous conflagration took place in the Side, Newcastle, which had originated in a shop occupied by Mr. Brewis as an eating house. The fire passed rapidly from the shops to the upper part ot the building. In half-an-hour the whole of the premises were one mass of flame, and in a short time sell headlong into the 'street. The property destroyed was very old, and built in that peculiar over hanging style which is so often to be met with in old towns. One part of the premises hadjbeen for a great number of years a silver smith's shop. In 1717 it was occupied by Thomas Kirkup, who was in 1763 succeeded by Mitcheson (afterwards Stalker and Mitcheson). He, again, was succeeded, in 1783, by Thomas Watson, who in 1846, was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Sewell, who occupied the premises until a few years ago, when he removed to Dean Street, The total damage caused by the fire was estimated at upwards of \u00a34,000. \u00ab 1864 (January 18) \u2014 Died, suddenly, at Raby Castle in his 76th year, Henry Vane, Duke and Marquis of Cleveland, K.G, Earl of Darlington, Viscount and Baron Barnard of Barnard Castle, and Baron Raby of Raby Castle. The deceased was the"], [428, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1864. 416 eldest son of the first Duke of Cleveland, by Lady Katherine Powlett, second daughter of the Duke of Bolton. He succeeded to the dukedom in 1842. In 1809 he had married the eldest daughter of the fourth Earl of Powlett, who died in 1859. In politics his grace was a Conservative, and from 1812 to 18l5he represented the county of Durham in Parliament. He sat for Tregony from the latter year to 1826, for Totness from 1826 to 1830, for Saltasb in 1830, and for South Salop from 1832 up to the date of his accession to the peerage. His grace, having died without issue, was succeeded by his brother, Lord Powlett. Not withstaning his grace came to the title, on the death of his father, so poor that he had to borrow \u00a320,000 from his duchess' nephew, Colonel Paulet Somerset, whom however, he paid off within the year, with a bequest of \u00a340,000 in addition, and notwithstanding his extraordinary munificence, he died leaving behind him a colossal fortune. 1864 (Febtuary 9/ \u2014 This morning an accident occurred in New castle, which, jbut for the cool intrepidity of Mr. E. Nicholson, rope manufacturer, would undoubtedly have proved fatal in its results. The scene of the occurrence was a large pond or reservoir situate in the Bull Park, at the extreme end of the Rope Walk, Moor Edge. The pond was not generally used, but some philanthropic gentlemen had kindly placed it at the disposal of an aged couple, who resided in a cottage close to the pond, and they gained a small pittance in winter by rendering the ice in a condition to meet the requirements of skaters. This morning they were thus engaged sweeping the snow when one of the party, named Ellen Southern, fell through the ice. Another of the party, Edward Moran, instantly ran to her assistance, as also did Mary Moran and Martha Downey. While around the breakage in the ice it suddenly gave way, and the whole of them were precipitated into the water, which at the spot was fourteen feet deep. Iu vain they endeavoured to regain the ice, and the shrieks of the women brought to the spot Mr. Nicholson, whose rope manufactory was immediately adjoining. He at once called to an assistant to bring some ropes, on obtaining which Mr. Nicholson ran in, and succeeded in rescuing the whole party, at the imminent risk of his own life. February 18. \u2014 Died, at the residence of his son, Mr. Charles Headlam, Ridley-place, Newcastle, in his 86th year, Thomas Emmerson Headlam, the well-known physician and alderman of that borough. For several years past it was evident to all his friends that the venerable doctor was fast failing, though amid the increasing infirmities of age his mind retained an almost youthful vigour. A few days previous it became apparent that he was upon the point of death, and Mr. Headlam, M.P., and other relatives were hastily summoned to his bedside. His illness rapidly increased in severity until it terminated fatally, shortly after one o'clock this morning. Dr. Headlam, having received and profited by a liberal education, commenced practice as a physician in the city of Durham, and"], [429, "A.D. 1864.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 417 continued there for a few years. Aster the death of the late Dr. Clarke he removed to Newcastle, where he soon obtained a con siderable reputation. It was about this time that he married the eldest daughter of the late Sir William Loraine, bart., of Kirk harle, the head of an old Northumbrian family. When the able and accomplished Dr. Ramsay left Newcastle, Dr. Headlam became the leading physician in the town, and acquired a large and remunera tive practice. The deceased was always a warm adherent of the Whig interest in the North of England, and of late years had become the Nestor of his party, a position which his vast experience admirably fitted him to fill. A few years back Dr. Headlam was placed in a striking and prominent position before his fellow towns men. It was on the occasion of Lord Brougham's visit to Newcastle, when the doctor presented an address to the great champion of the slave. The two old men had outlived the age of politicial animosity, and when they raised their bowed heads, whitened by the snow of eighty winters, in the presence of the vast assemblage which filled the hall, a thrill of enthusiasm, almost of reverence and adoration, shot through every breast. The remains of the deceased were interred on the 24th, at St. Andrew's Cemetery. The funeral procession included the Corporations of Newcastle and Gateshead, and other public bodies, and the prin cipal inhabitants of both towns. Places of business were closed during the afternoon, and the mournful event was observed throughout the neighbourhood with every mark of respect to the memory of the departed and regret at the loss sustained by his death. 1864 (AprU 30 j \u2014Mr. William Sutton, ofthe Royal Arcade Sale Rooms, became the recipient of an elegant and costly present, in an unexpected manner. It appeared that, some time ago, Mr. Sutton conducted an important transfer of property for one of his numerous clients, after which the accounts were settled in that gentleman's usual methodical and prompt manner. Mr. Sutton thought nothing more about the transaction untill this morning, when he received a box, which was found to contain a very elegant silver salver and drinking goblet, both elaborately chased. The salver contained the following inscription : \u2014 \" This salver and cup presented to Mr. William Sutton, in remembrance of his talented and valuable services as auctioneer.\" May 16. \u2014 This morning a most terrific thunderstorm burst over the south-west district of Northumberland, accompanied by torrents of rain. The consequence was that the waters in the Stocksfield Burn, a small tributary of the river Tyne, became flooded, and did immense damage in the neighbourhood of the stream. A bridge and two houses were washed away, along with a great quantity of farm produce ; and such a flood had not been known for a great number of years. May 16. \u2014 The volunteers in the North of England had a field day at Duiham to-day, when they assembled, to the number of 2,295, upon the race-course, and were inspected by Colonel VOL. III. F 2"], [430, "418 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF sA.D. 1864. Roney, the volunteer inspecting officer for this district. The in habitants of Durham had previously subscribed the sum of nearly \u00a3600, which was expended in preparing the ground sor the review and in providing refreshments for the volunteers. The various movements were gone throngh with great precision. At the close of the inspection the men on the ground engaged in a sham fight, which lasted for a considerable time, the proceedings being witnessed by more than 20,000 spectators. Colonel Roney, in addressing the officers after the fight expressed his great satisfac tion with the way in which the men had performed their duty. No accident occurred during the day. 1864 (May 19j. \u2014 The property situate on the east side of North gate, Darlington, called Buck's Charity Land, containing 12,400 square yards, and purchased in the year 1704, 160 years ago, for \u00a3100, was sold by public auction, to Mr. W. A. Wooler, of Sadberge Hall, for \u00a34,310. The land had been let, for grazing. at an yearly rent of \u00a330, and the increased value and growing demand in that neighbourhood, prompted the Commissioners to offer it for sale. May 25. \u2014 A feeling of gloom was cast over Newcastle this evening by the arrival of the intelligence of the death of Major William Adams Mather, of Beech Grove, Newcastle, and Long ridge, Berwick. The deceased had for some time past been unwell, but so recently as the 20th he attended a complimentary dinner, given to him by his brother officers of the Tyne Rifle Volunteers, on the occasion of his proceeding abroad to resuscitate his health. He left Newcastle on the 21st, and died at the Bath Hotel, Arlington -street, London, this morning. He was the eldest son of the late William Mather, esq., of Beech Grove, and was about 35 years of age and unmarried. He was kind, amiable, gentle, generous, and good to all who came in contact with him, and many who partook of his benevolence will now miss the donor. Seepage 63 of the present volume. The funeral obsequies took place on the 31st, in St. John's Cemetery, at Elswick, when his remains were attended to the grave by about two hundred volunteers, several influential gentlemen, friends of the deceased, of whom there was a great number, and the tenants en his landed estates. Owing to the immense concourse of spectators, it was with the greatest difficulty that the procession was enabled to pass along the lane to the cemetery. May 26. \u2014 A terrific boiler explosion took place this afternoon, at Mr. Davison's, Ph\u0153nix Flour Mill, Close, Newcastle. At the time of the occurrence the fireman James McFarlane, who was attending to his usual duties, was blown into the river, another man, named Isaac Maddison, was also precipitated into the water. Having been blown against a neighbouring building, he was rendered insensible for a few hours. McFarlane was admitted into the Infirmary, but died on the evening of the same day. June 12. \u2014 -A tragical event happened at St. Mary's Island, near Old Hartley, this afternoon. A pic-nic party from Seaton"], [431, "A.D. 1864.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 419 Delaval, had been spending the day on the island, and were about to return home. At tbat juncture a pitman, named Robert Bell, who had been drinking in a public house on the island, went up to the group, and demanded some money from a young man, named William Moore. A short altercation ensued, in the course of which Bell, raising a loaded gun, shot Ralph Moore in the thigh. Medical assistance was immediately obtained, but the unfortunate man gradually sauk, and expired in a few hours. Bell was tried at the next assizes before Chief Justice Cockburn, convicted, and sentenced to six years' penal servitude. 1864 (June 23/ \u2014 The ceremony of laying the foundation-stone of the Low Lights Docks took place to-day. The preparations made for celebrating the event were on an extensive scale, but, unfortu nately, the state of the weather proved most unfavourable, as it rained the whole of the time the proceedings were being gone through. The Borough of Tynemouth itselt presented quite a holiday appearance, and the vessels in the river, from the bridge to the bar, were gaily decorated with flags. The Tyne Commissioners, and other public bodies, assembled at North Shields Railway Station, and having marched in procession through the principal streets of the borough, they proceeded along the sands to Black Middens, the place where the stone had to be laid. The ceremony was performed by Joseph Cowen, esq., the chairman of the Tyne Commissioners. The commissioners and their friends, and the tradesmen of the borough, afterwards dined at the Assembly Rooms and the Commercial Hotel, respectively, and speeches suitable to the occasion were delivered. HEXHAM ABBEY GATE. June 28. \u2014 This evening a deputation, consisting of the ex churchwardens of the Abbey Church, Hexham, waited upon the Rev. William Rothery, at his residence in the Abbey, and presented"], [432, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1864. 420 to him, in the name ofthe subscribers, a valuable gold watch and purse of gold, as a spontaneous testimonial of the esteem in which he was held by a large circle of friends. Mr. Scott, the senior ex-churchwarden, presented the testimonial in appropriate terms, to which the rev. gentleman replied in a suitable speech. 1864 (June 28). \u2014 The great sporting event ofthe year in the North of England, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Meeting, commenced to-day. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr William I'Anson's br m Caller Ou (Challoner ,, beating Bakstichi Serai, Honest John, and seven others. The Gold Cup was won by Mr. J. Gray's Windham (Loates), beating National Guard, Skylark, and sour others. July 3. \u2014 A fearful calamity occurred off Sunderland Harbour early this morning. A small Scotch schooner, the Rose Haugh, of Inverness, left the port in the command of Andrew Ross as captain, a mate, and two seamen. A Steamboat towed the ship out, and a pilot was in charge. After they left what occurred had never transpired, the captain, who was in charge of the helm, stating that he sasv nothing until he heard the voice of one of the men in the water, shouting \" Oh, Aleck !\" On searching the vessel he found the whole of the men had disappeared. It was afterwards supposed that the two seamen had quarrelled, and the mate, going to separate them the whole had fallen overboard in the dark and were drowned. July 13. \u2014 At th9 general meeting of the Darlington Board ot Health plans were passed for no less than 179 houses. Of these 168 were on the Nestfield estate, the property of Robert Henry Allan, esq., of Blackwell Hall. The rapidly increasing population of the town is in a great measure attributed to the establishment of extensive ironworks consequent on the recent discovery of ironstone in the Cleveland Hills. As an instance of the value of land near Darlington, it may be stated that about 130 acres of the Nestfield estate have been sold by the late John Allan, esq., and the present owner for \u00a340,000. July 13. \u2014 The practical part of the proceedings of the Royal Agricultural Show was inaugurated to-day, at Long Benton, when the trial of steam ploughs was commenced. The proceedings which were of a highly interesting character, were witnessed by a large assemblage. This was the second time that Newcastle had been visited by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, an honour hitherto unprecedented by any town in the kingdom. September 8. \u2014A lamentable explosion of gas took place at Seghill Colliery early this morning, which caused the immediate death of seven persons, besides endangering the lives of several others. The names of the unfortunate sufferers were Richard Robinson, John Nieland, Henry Whitehead, Thomas Heep, John Mills, George Jackson, and William Taylor. September 19\u2014 Died, at his residence, in Wellington-place, Grange-road, Darlington, in the 54th year of his age, Mr. Henry Spencer, a gentleman of high literary attainments.

His intimate acquaintance with the people of the town and district was remarkable, and so well posted up was he in all local matters, that he was generally regarded as an authority on a varity of subjects. But, like most literary men of standard worth, he was not simply content to allow his literary efforts to find mere ephemeral publicity, but turned his really valuable biographical and historical knowledge to excellent account in the compilation of a work entitled \" Men that are gone from the Households of Darlington,\" a work which will remain an enduring monument of its author's research, local knowledge, and apt appre ciation of men and manners. 1864 (September U3). \u2014 A melancholy accident, by which a young gentleman lost his life, occurred to-day. The deceased, who was the youngest son of M. L. Jobling, esq , Newcastle, in company with a number of gentlemen, uas hunting in the neighbourhood of Reed water, when the horse on which he rode became bogged. While endeavouring to extricate himself, the unfortunate youth received a severe blow on the head from the animal's hoof. Immediate death was the result. November 9. \u2014 The election of chief magistrates for this district took place, with the following results: \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Colonel Perkins mayor ; William Lockey Harle, esq., sheriff. Gateshead \u2014 Councillor Johnson, esq. Tynemouth \u2014 George Jobling, esq. South Shields \u2014 William James, esq Sunderland \u2014 Councillor Gourlay, esq. Durham \u2014 Alderman G Robson, esq. Morpeth \u2014 William Wilson, esq. Berwick \u2014 Thomas Bouge, esq., mayor ; Dr. Richardson, sheriff. November 17. \u2014 A sad fatality occurred in the river Coquet this evening. Three men, named George Watson, Charles Milmo, and Wrlliam Simpson, were driving a horse and cart along a dangerous road, skirting the river, between Amble and Warkworth. The night was very dark, and the animal suddenly plunged and sell into the river. Assistance, though speedily at hand, was too late to be of any avail to the occupants of the vehicle, who were all drowned. November 19. \u2014 A very handsome contribution towards the restoration of St. Cuthbert's Church, Darlington, has been given by R. H. Allen, esq , the present head of one of the oldest families in the county. Mr. Allan contributes no less than five painted windows, by Clayton and Bell, of London, and Wailes, of Newcastle, for the transepts, besides placing in the hands of the architect, Gilbert Scott, the order for a sont in accordance with the period and worth of the church. The windows are intended to commemorate several members of the Allan family, many of whom have been buried within these venerable walls. November 24. \u2014 Shipping disasters of a melancholy character occurred this evening, at the mouth of the Tyne. Three vessels,"], [434, "422 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1864. an Aberdeen and London passenger steamer, the Stanley, a schooner, named the Friendship, and a large brig, in endeavouring to take shelter in the harbour, were stranded on the Black Middens. It was low tide, and, as a heavy sea was running, the lifeboat could not afford any assistance. Under these circumstances an effort was made to land some of the passengers of the Stanley in a boat, but no sooner had the frail craft lest the side of the vessel than it was struck by a wave and upset, the whole of the occupants being drowned within sight of those on the shore. The crew of the Friendship held on to the masts, in desperate resistance to tbe seas that were now and again breaking over and sweeping her decks. Their hoarse cries were most distressing. Doubly harrowing was it to think that, of all the hundreds of fellow creatures within a few yards from them, there was not one whose hand could be outstretched to save. About half-past ten o'clock, while attention was about equally divided between the two vessels, both of which were evidently in a critical state, the schooner was seen to be moved from her position by the tide, and sliding off that rock on which she had first been impelled. Directly she was free of the rock she capsized, and amidst the despairing and appal ling wail of those on board, which rose with painful distinctness above the voice of the storm, she and her crew disappeared beneath tne surface, the water closed over them, and their death knell was the subdued exclamation of horror and grief which arose from those who had witnessed the incident. This was the second time during the night that the ocean had claimed the tribute she exacts so inexorably from mankind, and taken it as if in derision of thos6 who would withold it from her. Out of the two vessels 34 of the crew and passengers were drowned. A Colchester brig was lost, and all hands, with the exception of one, off the south pier. The screw steamship Dalhousie, Captain Henry K. Glenny, trading between Newcastle and Dundee, was lost, and all hands, off the mouth of the Tay. Several other vessels were stranded, and much damage done to shipping along the coast, as well as a great sacrifice of human Use. 1864 (December 10/ \u2014 A sad accident occurred on the Border Counties Railway. The morning goods train, which left Newcastle shortly after seven o'clock, had reached Falstone, near BeUingham, when, from some cause or other, the engine was thrown oft' the line and overturned, the driver and fireman being instantly killed. December lb. \u2014 The celebration of the birthday of His Grace the Duke of Northumberland at Alnwick, Rothbury, and North Shields is always marked by many tokens of rejoicing ; and the seeling displayed to-day in commemoration of the auspicious event was, if possible, more hearty and expressive than on any former occasion. A dinner was held at each place, and attended by the principal inhabitants. At Alnwick the chair was filled by the Rev. L: S. Ord; at Rothbury by the Rev. G. S. Thompson, of Alnham ; and at North Shields by the Right Hon. Lord Ravens worth. The health of his grace was drunk with the greatest"], [435, "A.D. 1865.J REMARKABLE EVENTS. 423 enthusiasm, and amid a general wish that many more anniversaries might be in store for him. 1864 (December 17/\u2014 A horrible murder was committed at the village of Spen, near Winlaton. A pitman, named Atkinson, who had been at a shooting match, returned home in a state of drunkenness. When he arrived at the threshold he found that his wife had retired to rest, but on being summoned she got up and let him in. Thinking that she was in the same inebriated condition as himself, the brute seized the fire irons, and beat her in a frightful manner. Becoming exhausted he went out to refresh himself, and on regaining his strength re-entered the house, resumed the attack on his wife, and beat her until she was dead. The neigh bours, it seemed, had been to familiar with the unhappy couple quarreling to pay any attention to tbe cries of the poor woman, who was most horribly mutilated. He was shortly afterwards taken into custody. He was tried at the next Durham Assizes before Mr. Justice Mellor, was convicted of the murder and sen tenced to be hung, and was executed on the 16th March following. December 17. \u2014 A daring and wholesale robbery was discovered this morning to have taken place in the shop of Mr. Lupton, jeweller, Grey-street, Newcastle. The manner in which access was gained to the premises and the property carried off showed that the transaction had been most skilfully arranged beforehand, and that a number of persons had been engaged. By means of a ladder, which was standing at the back of the premises, the thieves succeeded in gaining the second floor ; they then descended into the passage, wrenched off the locks, forced the bolt, and thus gained admission to the shop. Watches, bracelets, rings, and other valuable articles, to the amount of \u00a32,000, were abstracted and carried off. December 29. \u2014 One of the most interesting gatherings, at this season of the year, is the dinner party of aged seamen at North Shields. The entertainment, which was generously pro vided by Joseph Straker, esq., of Benwell House, took place to-day, when about 150 old sailors assembled and partook of dinner at the Albion Assembly Rooms \u2014 the chair being occupied by the worthy host himself. Speeches of a genial character were delivered, and the veterans seemed to throughly appreciate and enjoy their annual treat. 1865 (January 8). \u2014 Died, at his residence, New Bridge-street, Newcastle, in his 78th year, Mr John Dobson, the talented and renowned architect. Few provincial men have attained a higher reputation in their profession than the late Mr. Dobson. Possessing a fine taste for the beautiful, both as regards the interior and exterior of his buildings, his great practical knowledge enabled him not only to develope to the full extent the ornamentation adapted to the order of the architecture, but to combine with it the greatest possible amount of space. Mr. Dobson was a most excel lent draughtsman, and the versatility of his genius was remarkable and displays itself in every work with which he was connected,"], [436, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1865. 424 and it would seem that he has lest no successor in the North of England to fill his place. He left one son and two daughters, one of the latter being married to Sidney Smirke, F.S.A., London, and the other had assiduously soothed and comforted the last days of a fond and indulgent parent. The mortal remains of the deceased were interred at Jesmond Cemetery on the 14th. Besides the members of Mr. Dobson's family, the funeral, which was of a strictly private character, was attended by a number of personal friends of the deceased. 1865 (January 20/ \u2014 Died, at her marine residence, Seaham Hall, Frances Annie, Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry, aged 64. For several months her ladyship had been seriously unwell, but up to within the previous ten days she appeared considerably. improved. Gifted with great ability and possessed of many virtues, she had left behind her a name which to be remembered is to be esteemed. Earl Vane, her ladyship's eldest son, succeeded to the principal portion of the family estates. Her remains were laid in the burial place of the Vane family, at Long Newton, on the 28th, amidst many tokens of heartfelt sorrow. February 11. \u2014 To-day, was launched from the extensive building yard of Messrs. Palmer, at Jarrow, one of the most remarkable vessels ever built on the Tyne. She was named the Scotland, and intended for the Indian trade. This immense vessel measured in length upwards of 394 feet, had two engines, each of 200 horse power, 3,693 gross tonnage, and fitted up to carry nearly 1,000 persons. February 12. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick Castle, aged 73, Algernon, Duke of Northumberland. The noble duke had been suffering for some time from rheumatic gout, and although the attack had been severe it was not so serious as to occasion the uneasiness which was felt shortly afterwards. On the previous afternoon his grace was left so feeble and prostrated that he because unconscious. A message was immediately despatched for Dr. Charlton, Newcastle, who, in answer to the summons, immediately proceeded to Alnwick by special train. All medical aid was unavailing, the duke never rallied, and in the presence of the duchess, who had assiduously watched by the bedside of her husband, this great and good man breathed his last. Loved and respected by all who came in contact with him, graced by personal gifts which endeared him to all who had the privilege of his acquaintance, honoured by his Sovereign, and known to his country men for his princely munificence, and genial hospitality and good works, his name will long remain engraved in their hearts. Algernon Percy, fourth Duke of Northumberland, Earl of Noi thumberland, Earl and Baron Percy, Baron Lacy, Poynings, Fitz- Payne and Eryan, Latimer, Warkworth, and Prudhoo, was born on the 15th of December, 1792. He enteied the navy in 1805, on board the Tribune frigate. He was afterwards midshipman in the Fame, in which ship he was actively employed on the coast of Catalonia, in 1809. He became commander 8th March, 1814, and post captain"], [437, "A.D. 1865.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 425 15th August, 1815. The general peace in that year released him from his naval professional duties, and a more tranquil career opened to his ambition. He was called to the House of Lords, in 1816, by the title of Lord Prudhoe. From the time of his coming to the proud titles and vast possessions of his ancestors, he ever signalised himself as a lover of science, and a distinguished patron of literature and art, and of arch\u00e6logical and historical investigation. On the 25th of August, 1842, he married the Lady Eleanor Grosvenor, daughter of the second Marquis of Westminster, and their union had been one of uninterrupted felicity. His amiable and illustrious consort ever seconded him in all his good and charitable works, was the sunshine of his home, and the ministering angel of his declining years. The mortal remains of his grace were interred in Westminster Abbey, on the 25th, with all the ceremony due to his exalted rank. \u2014 See Page 214. PORTRAIT OF ALGERNON, FOURTH DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND. 1865 (February 20/\u2014 A melancholy accident occurred off Hartle pool this morning, which resulted in the death of nine persons. A fishing lugger, on attempting to make the harbour, was caught by a heavy sea and disabled. The vessel drifted towards the shore, which|the crew endeavoured to reach in one of their small boats, VOL. III. G 2"], [438, "426 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1863. but they had scarcely got into their frail craft when it was struck by a wave and capsized, those on board perishing before assistance could be rendered. 1865 (March 12/ \u2014 A distressing occurrence was witnessed this afternoon, at the mouth of tbe Tyne. Four boys proceeded in a boat to the Herd Sands, and being unacquainted with the management the boat was upset, and before assistance arrived they were all drowned. April 19. \u2014 This day, amidst great rejoicings, the foundation stone of a new building for the members of the Mechanics' Institution was laid by Her Majesty's principal Secretary of State, the Right Hon. Sir George Grey, bart. The handsome silver trowel was presented by Mr. Ralph Thompson, of the Arcade, and the whole affair passed off with great enthusiasm. A procession was formed at the New Town Hall, consisting of the mayor, sheriff, and Town Council, the clergy, various public bodies, members of the institution, &c , &c, which, headed by the band of the First Newcastle Volunteer Artillery, walked up Grey-street to the site (between the Weavers' Tower and the Unitarian Chapel) in New Bridge-street. The Rev. the Vicar read a prayer, and the usual ceremonies were observed on the occasion. April 27. \u2014 Died, in Newcastle, at the residence of her son, Robert Plummer, esq., aged 86, Mary, widow of the late Matthew Plummer, esq., who was one of the most eminent merchants in Newcastle, From authentic data it would seem that the Plummer family were driven out of Ireland at the time of the great Irish rebellion, in 1641, their ancestors having previously gone over from thiscountry. They settled atandnear Thormanby, Yorkshire, a village between Thirsk and Easingwold, and applied themselves chiefly to agriculture. The late Mr. Plummer was educated at Sowerby School, near Thirsk, aud for a short time pursued farming under the late Mr. John Graham Clarke, of Newcastle, who being pleased with the youth's intelligence and industry, transferred him to his office, and thus began in 1785, Mr. Matthew Plummer's connexion with Newcastle. Mr. Clarke was largely engaged as a West India merchant in Pilgrim-street, where he had also an extensive brewery. Mr. Plummer afterwards commenced business for himself on the Quayside, in partnership with Mr. Russel Blackbird, as a ship and insurance broker, then with Mr. W. N. Greenwell, and finally- with his eldest son. Subsequently Mr. Plummer became a partner in the Northumberland Flax Mills, and the St. Lawrence Bottle Works, and was engaged in other com mercial adventures. Somewhat later in life he became a considerable coalowner, and he also became possessor of valuable landed property in the neighbourhood of Gateshead and Newcastle. He was engaged in most of the undertakings and questions which affected the port of Newcastle, in the prosperity of which he took the warmest interest, and for thirty-three years was vice-consul for the United States of America. He was a director of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway from its com-"], [439, "a.d. 1865.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 427 mencement, for fifteen years he was chairman of the board, and in great part to the energy, economy, and skilful manage ment of Mr. Plummer the success of this undertaking is to be attributed. Mr. Plummer married first, in 1794, Catherine, daughter of the late Robert Spencer, of Bawtry and Durham ; and,' secondly, Mary, daughter of the late William Storey, of Bishop wearmouth, and widow of the late Robert Spencer, surgeon, of Newcastle. Mr. Plummer was the model of an English merchant, punctual, upright, and industrious beyond example, and his name and high character were well known and honoured in almost every port in the civilized world. In private life his conduct was most exemplary, as a husband, father, and friend he was without reproach, and his memory will ever be cherished by his attached family and friends ; whilst his name will be associated with many of our greatest local undertakings which he survived to see prosecuted to a successful issue. 1865 (May 1). \u2014 The Wansbeck Valley Railway was opened throughout for passenger and goods traffic. The new line reaches from Morpeth to Redesmouth Junction on the Border Union Railway, a distance of upwards of 25 miles. At Morpeth the line joins on to the Blyth and Tyne Railway, and, by means of an arrangement between the companies concerned, through communi cation is thus obtained between the district now opened up and Newcastle and Scotland. May 1. \u2014 A terrific boiler explosion took place at Haswell Colliery, near Castle Eden, resulting in the loss of three lives and severe injuries to several others. May 16. \u2014 A distressing accident occurred to-day at the Hendon Rifle Range, near Sunderland. A number of volunteers were shooting at a target, when Sergeant-Major Heading, who was acting as marksman, approached the spot without displaying the usual signal, and was shot, the wound proving fatal in a few hours. May 27. \u2014 An alarming fire took place at the Tyne Docks this afternoon. Large quantities of Esparto grass, a material used for the manufacture of paper, was stowed in a shed there. Prompt measures being taken the flames were speedily subdued, but not before the shed was reduced to ruins, aud a great deal of other valuable property destroyed. On the 29th, another destruc tive fire broke out in the same warehouse. The conflagration caused considerable alarm, and the damage was estimated at about \u00a38,000. June 12. \u2014 This evening a skiff race between the celebrated scullers Chambers and Cooper, came off on the Tyne. The race was for \u00a3100 aside, and the stretch of water rowed over about a mile in length. After an exciting contest Chambers came in the winner by half a boat length. Before the start a man, named Gascoigne, dived from the High Level Bridge into the Tyne. June 27. \u2014 The great local carnival \u2014 the Newcastle Race Meeting \u2014 was inaugurated to-day.

This morning the deceased gentleman took the train at the Jesmond Station on the Blyth and Tyne Railway, and proceeded to Choppington, and from thence to Sheepwash, where he met Mr. Hogarth, a builder, with whom he entered into conversation in his usual free and hearty manner, being apparently in good health. On their return, having had to use some unusual exertions in order to catch the train, Mr. Grace, on taking his seat, complained of being unwell, and on arriving at Seghill Station he was found to be dead. The deceased gentleman, who was fifty years of age, was a member of the bench of magistrates, and of the Town Council of Newcastle; and iu the year lb56-7 he filled the office of mayor, after being sheriff in 1854-5. Mr."], [442, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1865. 430 Grace being well known and deservedly respected in Newcastle, and throughout the northern counties generally for his worth, urbanity, and the unvarying kindness of his disposition, his loss was severely regretted by an extensive business connection and a numerous circle of friends. On the 8th his remains were consigned to their last resting place in Jesmond Cemetery in the presence of his sorrowing relatives and friends. 1865(August5). \u2014 The village of Mats en, which has been described as matchless for the monotony of its movements, was this day full of bustle and animation. It was natural that such should be the case, seeing that the youngest daughter of the worthy baronet of Matfen was about to be united to Captain Egerton, of Waplington Manor, the eldest son of the late Rev. Thomas Egerton, and a nephew of Lord Egerton, of Tatton Park, Cheshire, an alliance everyway worth of her heart and hand. The marriage ceremony was performed by the Rev. Michael Maxwell Heron, M.A., Rector of Heddon-on-the-Wall, the domestic chaplain to the Right Hon. the Earl of Stair, assisted by the Rev. J. Benn, of Matfen. August 7. \u2014 The great scullers' race, for \u00a3200 aside, between Wilson, of Newcastle, and Kilsby. of London, was decided this afternoon, on the Thames, from Putney to Mortlake Kilsby won by five lengths. August 8. \u2014 An aquatic contest, which excited great interest, took place this afternoon, over the same course, between Chambers, of Newcastle, and Kelley, of London. KeUy won by about four lengths. August 25. \u2014 Died, at the vicarage, Eglingham, the Venerable R. C. Coxe, Archdeacon of Landisfame. The Archdeacon expired this morning after a long and painful illness. Few men fulfilled the high duties of his calling, whether as parish priest, Vicar of Newcastle, or Archdeacon of Lindisfarne, with more earnest zeal, or greater ability, and in all these he won the esteem ofthe clergy, and the respect and admiration ofthe laity. Deceased was educated at Worcester College, Oxford, where he graduated B A., in honours, in 1821. He became Fellow of his College, and Chaplain of Archbishop Tenison's Chapel, London, from whence he was appointed Vicar of Newcastle, on the death of the Rev. John Dodd, by the then Bishop of Carlisle, Dr. Percy. In 1853 he resigned the Vicarage of Newcastle, on his appointment, by Bishop Maltby, to the Archdeaconry of Landisfarne and Vicarage of Eglingham. The late Archdeacon was the author of several valuable theological works including \" The Symmetry of Revela tion,\" \" Lectures on the Evidence from Miracles,\" and of \" Sacred and other Poems,\" \" Local Ballads,\" and \" Sonnets,\" and also a metrical version of the \" Silviludia\" of Cassimir Sarbievius, &c, &c. In how many a rural village in England, amidst quiet glebes and old umbrageous trees, do the genius and piety which, after being matured at the great seats of learning, become the lights and ornament of the church, find in the autumn of life a holy retreat"], [443, "A.D. 1865.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 431 and a dignified repose. And the truth of this was seldom more exemplified than in the quiet little village of Eglingham, encircled among protecting trees, serenaded by babbling streamlets, and lying almost beneath the shadows of the Cheviots, where the hard working parish priest, the select preacher of Oxford, tho laborious Vicar of Newcastle, the eloquent and faithful Archdeacon of Lindisfarne, the scholar, the gentleman, the divine, spent the last years of a noble life. And on the 31st, when all that was mortal of him was consigned to the grave, there was no funeral pomp, no fictitious emblem of mourning, but a quiet, solemn, affecting ceremonial. 1865 (September 26). \u2014 Great consternation and excitement pre vailed among cowkeepers and others in this district when it became known that the much dreaded rinderpest was in their midst. This morning Mr. Hindson, cowkeeper, near Sinton's Mill, had four died within a few hours. The whole of his stock, amounting to about thirty, fell a prey to the disease or the pole-axe ; and all throughout. Newcastle, in a sew weeks, there was scarcely a byre but had been laid waste, not so much from the disease as the indiscriminate use of the axe by order of the inspectors. The appointment of local inspectors into the wholesale condition of cattle entering the public market was wise iu principle, as calcu lated to arrest the spread of contagious action, but the delegation of a power to order the destruction of every beast pronounced by the inspectors infected, to persons who had yet to prove their quali fications for such a trust, was highly dangerous to the interests of the owners of cattle. The sufferers ultimately received part com pensation from the Government and local subscriptions. The total value of cattle lost in Newcastle was \u00a37,164. October 18. \u2014 The brief and mournful intimation, \" Lord Palmerston is dead,\" was received in Newcastle this afternoon, and read with general and deep regret. The noble lord was bom on the 20th of October, 1784, so that in two days he would have seen his 81st birthday. November 8. \u2014 A testimonial was presented to the Mayor and Mayoress of Gateshead (Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Johnson), in accordance with a good old English custom, expressed in the following legend : \u2014 Gif ye goode maior sd everre be made fatherre inne hys yere of maoraltee, then sal be giften bye ye townmenne free ane silver cradle too hys faire ladye.\" If the testimonial in this case did not carry out the letter of the legend it did the spirit, the gift of the donors being a silver salver and tankard. The presentation was made by the Right Hon. WiUiam Hutt, M P., who complimented Mr. Johnson on the gratifying manner in which the business of the council had been conducted during his mayoralty. November 9. \u2014 The election of chief magistrates for this district took place, with the following results : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 Alderman Dodds, esq., mayor ; Henry Angus, esq., sheriff.

The fire continued to rage all day and was not finally subdued until a late hour in the evening. The damage was estimated at about \u00a35,000. November 15. \u2014 A terrific explosion occurred this morning at the Newcastle Station of the Blyth and Tyne Railway by which two men, named James Whitehead and Robson Hepple, were killed, and another seriously injured. The accident occurred through the yielding of a fire box of a locomotive, which caused the explosion of several of the tubes forming the boiler. November 15. \u2014 A melancholy accident occurred at a late hour this evening at a placed called Throckley Bank Top, about seven miles west from Newcastle. Mr. James Elliott, the well known corporation contractor for carting, had been driving out westward for the purpose of purchasing horses, in company with Johu Burns, landlord of the Fox and Hounds public house, Benwell, and, on their return home, when approaching that part of the road where a bye road crosses it, which leads to Ponteland, and at which is placed a toll bar, the horse on passing through dragged the vehicle against one of the posts, and the shaft giving way the gig fell to the ground with great violence. Mr. Elliott was pitched head foremast to the ground and killed instantaneously. Mr. Burns succeeded in escaping with a severe shaking and some slight bruises and scratches. December 19. \u2014 Died, at London, whither he had gone to consult some physicians as to his failing health, after a protracted illness, Nicholas Wood, esq., the eminent engineer. Mr. Wood was the first patron of the celebrated George Stephenson at Killingworth. His remains were interred in Hetton Churchyard on the 23rd, and were attended by a great number of friends and gentlemen connected with the coal trade. December 28. \u2014 This evening a frightful and fatal occurrence took place at the Lyceum Theatre, Sunderland. While the Christmas pantomime was in progress a gas pipe burst, and an explosion took place, the dress of the columbine, Miss Ricardo, was set on fire, and before the flames were extinguished the poor girl sustained such severe injuries that she died shortly afterwards. 1866 (February 6/ \u2014 Mr. Trotter, the well-known and highly respected solicitor, of Bishop Auckland, met his death to-day, under very melancholy circumstances. The learned gentleman had just arrived at the meet of theHurworth foxhounds, and was riding a spirited horse, which suddenly reared, throwing its rider aud falling upon him. Death was almost instantaneous. February 19. \u2014 Mr. John Benson, a member of the Town Council of Newcastle, died, at his residence, this morning."], [445, "A.D. 1866.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 433 Deceased took an active part in all that appertained to the welfare of the town. His premature death was much deplored by all classes. Mr. Hawthorn, a respected surgeon, also expired to-day, after a short illness. The deaths of both gentlemen were attributed to typhus fever. 1866 (February 21/ \u2014 A pig, fed by Mr. Thomas Fender, was slaughtered at Holy Island, and sold to Mr. Gordon, butcher, Lowick, the length of which, when hung up, was nine feet one inch, six feet three inches in girth, and weighed sixty stones four pounds. February 28. \u2014 After several weeks of excitement the election of a member to represent Sunderland took place to-day. Mr. Candlish commenced with the lead, and continued at the head of the poll till the close, defeating his opponent, Mr. Henry Fenwick (who had been appointed one of the Lords of the Admiralty), by a majority of 134. March 12 \u2014 In pursuance of the order of Quarter Sessions, holden at Durham, the magistrates, acting in the Petty Sessional Division of the South-Eastem Division of the Darlington Ward, held a meeting, in the Police Court, previous to the transaction of the usual business. Messrs. R. H. Allan, J. H. Aylmer, Lieut-Col. Scurfield, the Rev. J. W. Smith, and Major Bell, were present, and it was resolved that Mr. R. H. Allan be appointed chairman, and Mr. Hugh Dunn clerk to the committee, and that the committee meet every Monday, at a quarter to twelve o'clock. May 17. \u2014 The workmen engaged in digging the foundation of a house on the Nestfield estate, near Darlington, found at the depth of five or six feet, a human skeleton, lying north and south, The present was not the only discovery of the same nature. On the 4th December, 1863, a skeleton was found near the same spot, only eighteen inches beneath the surface of the ground. The remains were those of an adult of large stature. In March, 1854, about three hundred yards further off, and at two feet below the surface, the remains apparently those of a man of ordinary size were disturbed. The superincumbent mass was mixed with a large quantity of burnt wood. In 1843, in digging the foundation for the bridge over the River Skerne for the North-Eastern Railway, at a few hundred yards distance, similar remains were discovered. A few years previously in some land in Haughton-le-Skerne, within two or three fields distance, a vast quantity of human bones were removed, which apparently had been deposited in confusion. Taking these circumstances in connexion, is it unreasonable to conjecture that on the banks of the Skerne, in the locality alluded to, may have taken place one of those encounters with the marauding Scotch, whose love of the beeves of the green pastures of England, made almost every parish in the North of England the scene of fire and sword ?

After taking wine with the Mayor, in the Com Exchange, the numerous bodies who took part in the ceremony formed in procession and marched to the site of the school, in Rye-hill. After the ceremony of laying the stone, the scholars were entertained at luncheon in the Town Hall, and presented to the head master, Mr. Snape, a valuable silver salver and an address, and to Mr. Richardson, assistant master, a silver inkstnnd. In the evening the head master delivered a lecture on \" Literature,\" before the Literary and Philosophical Society. 1866 (May 29/ \u2014 The most rapid and destructive fire that Sunder land had seen for many years broke out about twelve o'clock at noon, at the extensive cabinet-making and upholstery establishment of Mr. Chapman (successor to Messrs Alcock and Son), and in little more than an hour property estimated at \u00a315,000 was destroyed. June 18. \u2014 A melancholy accident took place in the county of Durham, resulting in the death of George Wilkinson, esq., of Oswald House, a gentleman belonging to an old county family, and who was well known and respected over the whole district. Deceased had been out shooting with Captain Scarmann, and it was supposed that his gun had gone off accidentally, the shot taking effect in his head. June 24. \u2014 An alarming fire broke out in the Close, Newcastle, this morning resulting in the destruction of a large flour mill and grain warehouses, and part of the High Level Bridge. The fire was the most destructive that had occurred in this district since the Gateshead explosion. The damage was estimated at \u00a330,000, and this was considered a low estimate. The flour mill and warehouses were the property of Mr. Robert Brown. July 26. \u2014 The Newcastle race meeting opened to-day, under most promising circumstances. The Northumberland Plate was won by Mr. Johnstone's b c Rococo (Cameron), beating Primate, Red Earl, and four others, The Stewards' (Gold) Cup was won by Mr. Morgan's b m Molly Carew (Snowdon), beating Windham, Sundeelah, and five others. After the sports, a disgraceful riot took place, on the part of a number of Irishmen, hailing principally from Jarrow. They made a provoking attack on the spectators, who turned round upon their assailants and gave them a complete thrashing. Several of the combatants were seriously injured. July 8. \u2014 The last of the two great acquatic events, the international sculling matches, which for so many weeks were the cause of so much excitement, in this district, was this morning fairly and fully decided on the Tyne. The result was that the championship of the world remained with Kelly, the champion oarsman of England, Hamill, the champion rower of the United States, not having the shadow of a chance. The stakes amounted to \u00a31,000. July 11. \u2014 The inhabitants of the west end of Newcastle were aroused, at an early hour this morning, by the firing of cannon and other demonstrations of rejoicing, consequent on the"], [447, "A.D. 1866.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 435 marriage of WiUiam Hawthorn, jun., esq., the only son of William Hawthorn, esq., of Benwell Cottage, to Elizabeth Maria, the accom- plished and only daughter of William John Van Haansbergen, esq., of Enfield Lodge, Elswick. 1866 (July 31/ \u2014 A fearful catastrophe occurred to-night off the mouth of the Tyne. During the gale which prevailed a fine barque was wrecked, and ten of her crew, including the master, were drowned. The vessel was the Ostrich, the property of Mr. John Barras, of West Cramlington. - She was commanded by George Jackson, residing in Church- way, North Shields. It appeared that she had to wait outside the harbour for a portion of her crew, and to this circumstance the melancholy occurrence was in a great measure due. After getting her crew on board, in a most unsatis- factory condition, she anchored for the night, but was driven upon the rocks off Marsden. She broke up immediately, and of the fourteen persons on board only four reached/he land. August 4. \u2014 Died, at Dissington Hall, in the 75th year of his age, Edward Collingwood, esq. The deceased was the third son of the late Walter Spencer Stanhope, esq., of Cannon Hall, in the county of York, by Mary Winnifred, daughter of Thomas Pulliene, esq., of Carlton Hall, in the same county. He was born in the year 1791, and in 1821 married Frances, daughter of Colonel Maxwell. Mr. Collingwood was a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy-Lieutenant for Northumberland. He also filled the office of High Sheriff for the same county in the year 1824. He assumed the name of Collingwood by royal license, after his maternal grandmother, in 1816. The punctual manner in which he attended to the important duties connected with his magisterial office for the long period of thirty-five years, was proverbial, and the list of the grand jury at the Courts of Assize was scarcely considered complete without his name being incorporated in it. Mr. Colling- wood was highly respected by his equals, whilst by the humbler classes of society he was universally beloved. August 23. \u2014 The foundation-stone of tbe Newcastle-upon-Tyne Borough Lunatic Asylum, at Coxlodge, was laid this afternoon by Thomas Hedley, esq., the chairman of the visiting committee of Justices. The commencement of this building had been anxiously looked forward to for a long time, both by the magistrates of the and the members of the Board of Guardians. The estimated expense at the outset was something near \u00a340,000, which un- doubtedly seemed very large, but not too large, considering the humane object of the institution ; and, besides, the repayment of the money will not fall heavily on the ratepayers, as it is spread over a long term of years. The architect of tbe establishment was Mr William Lambre Moffatt, of Fittes'-row, Edinburgh ; and the contractors for the building were \u2014 Mr Walter Scott, of Newcastle, for executing the mason and brick work ; Mr. Joseph White, of Morpeth, the carpenter and joiner work ; Mr. Henry Watson, of Newcastle, the plumber work ; Messrs. Johnston, of Carlisle, the."], [448, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1866 436 plaster work j Messrs. William Dawler and Son, of Sunderland, the slating work ; Messrs. J. Richardson, of Newcastle, the glazing work ; and Messrs. Close, Burlinson, and Co., for executing the iron work. The building will be erected to afford accommodation for all insane paupers chargeable to the borough of Newcastle-on- Tyne. It is designed and planned with a view of sheltering its un fortunate inmates from the consequences of their malady, and of placing within their reach the means of recovery and all those com forts and consolations which science and benevolence have suggested for the alleviation of their sufferings and the amelioration of their miserable condition. 1866 (September 13/ \u2014 This day the inhabitants of the ancient town of Hexham celebrated an event which will ever be recorded in the annals of the town, the opening of the chaste and elegant pile cf buildings, admirably situated in the very centre of the town, fronting that noble and venerable structure, the Abbey Church. Although the scheme was originated by the Local Board of Health, the principal and most enthusiastic promoter has been Mr. W. B. Beaumont, M P., whose good offices to elevate Hexham to a lead ing position are untiring, and have hitherto been very successful. At a public luncheon which succeeded the business proceedings of the day, a felicitous interchange of sentiment took place, in which future suggestions for the further improvement of Hexham was the staple topic. TYNE BRIDGE, NOW REMOVED. September 17. \u2014 Arrangements having been made by the River Tyne Commissioners with the Corporation of Newcastle\", the Lords of the Admiralty gave their consent to ereot a new bridge on the"], [449, "A.D. 1866.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 437 site ofthe old Tyne Bridge, which was opened in the year 1781. The new bridge is to have an opening in the middle, in the form of a swing, to admit of the passage of ships to the upper part of the river. This morning a temporary wooden bridge, which had been erected across the Tyne. was formally opened. There was no cere mony, and the only circumstance which gave the event an official aspect was the attendance of a few of the River Tyne Commission ers. The structure, although only of a temporary character, has been built in a most substantial manner. Workmen at once com menced to remove the old bridge. 1866 (September 19/ \u2014 This day was inaugurated, by the Right Hon. Earl Grey, an exhibition of paintings and other works of art, in the New Town Hall, Newcastle. The exhibition was arranged by the members of the Mechanics' Institution, for the benefit of the fund for their new building now being erected in New Bridge Street. It was open four weeks, and was very successful, a balance of \u00a3430 having been paid over to the fund. The principal con tributors of paintings were I. L. Bell, esq., R. S. Newall, esq., Jas. Leathart, esq., <fcc. Mr. Bulletti contributed some valuable car vings, and Mr. W. Rea, organist, gave his valuable aid. The committee, as a mark of their appreciation of his kindness, shortly afterwards presented Mr. Rea with a handsome silver tray, valued at \u00a325. The acting committee were Messrs. D. D. Main, A. Carse, John T. Campbell, Frederick Hay, W. C. Warren, &c, &c. The new building will be a very handsome structure, and will cost nearly \u00a34,000. The design is by Thomas Oliver, esq., aud reflects great credit on that gentleman's taste and ability. The principal contractors are Mr. John Welton, builder, George Bell, joiner, Messrs. Walker and Emley, iron founders, R. Thompson, painter, Mr. Wilkinson, plasterer, &c. September 24. \u2014 This afternoon the magnificent troop ship the Jumna, which for a period of nearly two years had been in process of building in the yard of Messrs. Palmer and Co., Jarrow, was launched in the presence of a large and highly distinguished com pany invited to witness the ceremony, aud in sight also of a much more numerous assemblage of uninvited spectators. Her immense length was fully seen as she lay athwart the stream, and appeared almost to bridge the river. October 31. \u2014 Early this morning one of the most calamitous colliery explosions which had occurred in the district for many years took place at Old Pelton, in the county of Durham. The melancholy catastrophe occurred about six o'clock, when a great many of the men and boys were at work. The report of the ex plosion was heard in a radius of upwards of two miles, which awakened, with fearful forebodings, the villagers, who intuitively rushed to the scene. Mr. James Ritson, the deputy-viewer, and others endeavoured to descend the shaft, but the foul air for some time precluded their going down. Eventually, however, they succeeded, and found the sad fact that twenty-four had paid the last great debt of nature, and several others were seriously injured."], [450, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1866. 438 1866 (November 9) \u2014 The election of chief magistrates for this district took place to-day : \u2014 Newcastle \u2014 W.

November 25 \u2014 Early this morning a desperate act of suicide was committed in Newcastle by a female, who leaped from the parapet of the High Level Bridge into the Tyne. On the following morn ing a person named William Sayers, residing at 23, Leazes-crescent Newcastle, called at the Manors Police Station, and identified the shawl and bonnet belonging to the woman as being the propeity of his sister, Elizabeth Murphy, who had been living apart from her husband, owing to some family differences. It appeared that John Murphy, the husband of the unfortunate woman was a car riage maker at the railway shops, York, and was on a visit to Newcastle at the time, and it was supposed that the result of the interview he had with his wife had led to the commission of the rash act. December 29. \u2014 Byker Mill, near Newcastle, was completely destroyed by fire. The damage was estimated at \u00a31,500. 1867 (January 14/ \u2014 At the Newcastle Freemen's Guild, held to-day, Mr. Meikle paid a well-deserved and graceful compliment to Mr. Clayton, town clerk, prior to his retirement from office. During his address, Mr. Meikle said the people of Newcastle would ever be reminded of the great and eminent services Mr. Clayton had rendered for fully forty years, owing to \" Clayton\" street being one of the central streets of the town. Mr. Clayton's reply was apt, able, and full of historical reminiscences. February 5. \u2014 Died, at his residence, No. 4, Saville-place, Newcastle, very suddenly, aged 51, John George Abbot, esq. The deceased was head of the firm of John Abbot and Co., the eminent iron and brass sounders, of Gateshead, works that have been in existence for a long period of time, and which have grown, under the fostering care of Mr. Abbot, to be one of the largest works of the kind in the kingdom, and, upon the formation of that concern into a limited company, became chairman of the board of directors. Mr. Abbot, as an employer of labour, was greatly respected by the working classes with whom he came much in contact ; and in addition to the esteem of a numerous circle of friends to whom he was endeared by his kindly disposition and genial manner, he enjoyed the confidence and esteem of the commercial world, to whom he was widely known as the worthy successor of a name which had established a claim on their confidence by nearly half a century of honourable and liberal dealing.

April 26. \u2014 A melancholy and fatal occurrence took place near Felton. It appeared that Mr. Bell, of Oxford-street, New castle, left home this morning in company of Mr. Pursell, a friend, to enjoy a day's fishing in the Coquet, and in the afternoon Mr. Bell and his friend parted company with the understanding to meet at Felton. Mr. Pursell returned to the inn a little before five, aud finding Mr. Bell absent, went in search of him, without finding any trace. The search was continged next morniDg, when Mr. Bell's fishing rod was found on the river bank, immediately over an almost perpendicular cliff. The river was afterwards draggged, and the body found about 150 yards below where the rod had been picked up. The deceased had evidently fallen over the cliff while trying to disengage his hook from the branches of a tree growing on the edge. Mr. Bell was upwards of sixty years of age, was an elder brother of the Newcastle Trinity House, and had recently filled the post of pilot master at that port. May 6. \u2014 This afternoon, in the presence of an immense gathering of spectators, and with an interest centred in the contest such as has been rarely paralleled in the history of British sports, Henry Kelley, of Putney, London, and Robert Chambers, of St. Anthony's, Newcastle, rowed a straightaway sculler's race on the Tyne, over a stretch of about five miles, for \u00a3200 a side and the championship. After a severe contest Kelly was declared the victor. May 6. \u2014 This evening a terrible calamity occurred in New castle. Owing to the boat race which took place on the Tyne, between Robert Chambers and Henry Kelley, there was an unusual number of visitors in the town, and whilst several people were waiting for a steamer, at the Quayside, to convey them to Shields and other places, the gangway on which they were standing gave way and they were thrown into the water A terrible scene ensued and several pessons were drowned, but not so many as was at first imagined. May 17. \u2014 For some weeks previous a subscription had been set on foot for the purpose of presenting to Mr. John Usher a testi monial, as a mark of the esteem in which he is held by his friends and neighbours in the borough of Gateshead. Mr. Usher had been a public servant in the borough for upwards of thirty-five years, and during that time, through his genial and kind disposition, as well as his upright conduct as a public officer, had won for himself a host of admiring friends, all of whom felt a pleasure in being able to contribute towards a testimonial. This evening was set aside for the presentation, and the friends of Mr. Usher, therefore, met at Mr. E. Neilson's, Grey Horse Inn, where a first class dinner"], [452, "440 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [A.D. 1867. was provided for the occasion, which certainly did infiuite credit both to Mr. Neilson and his good lady. The gentlemen present were the mayor (Mr. George Miller), Councillors Tucker, Neilson, Hogg, and Weddell; Messrs. T. Robson, R. Wakefield, W. J. Browne, Gregory, Pearson, J. Usher, T. Bowman, Joseph Newton, W. Usher, T. A. Boyd, Simm, T. Harbutt, Hanning, &c. The testimonial, which consisted of a splendid gold watch and chain, was presented by the mayor in a feeling and appropriate speech. The guard was then placed round the neck of Usher amidst loud and vociferous applause. The mayor then said \" Also I feel great pleasure in presenting to you, on behalf of Mrs. Usher, this very handsome tea and coffee service, as a mark of respect which is felt for her as the partner of your life and the sharer of your various vicissitudes.\" The watch, a piece of fine mechanism, was from the establishment of Mr. Edmond Wakefield, and the tea and coffee service was supplied by Mr. Caris. 1867 (May 29). \u2014 The usually quiet town of Alnwick was this day the scene of great excitement and rejoicing, owing to Lord Warkworth, the eldest son of Earl Percy, having attained his majority. Born to the possession of vast estates, extending over most of the broad tract of land that lies between the Tweed and the Tyne, with a revenue exceeding that of many Continental kingdoms, with marble halls, and though not vassals and serfs, yet willing hands and loving hearts by his side, it was fitting that the heir of Northumberland should call together his friends, his kinsfolk, his neighbours, and his dependants, and ask them to rejoice with him on the auspicious occasion. And what a rejoicing was there. There were great and small, young and old ; and then the soul stirring spectacle, that of the thousand tenantry congregated in the noble dining hall, which was extemporized for the occasion. There were the stout yeomanry from a score of parishes, all claiming the Duke of Northumberland for their lord. There had not, as on a former occasion, been brought down from Curzon-street a troop of French artistes, great in the mystery of stewpans and stoves, &c, but the duke's own cooks were equal to the occasion, and produced a banquet fit to \" set before a king.\" The tables literally groaned beneath barons of beef (25 stones each), haunches of venison, lamb, mutton, veal, poultry, fish ; nay, every edible was there in most magnificent profusion, and it is hardly too much to say that the whole county was feasted, the festivities being kept up for several days, so that there were sew Northumbrian* but what knew where foamed the duke's ale. Lord Warkworth represents a family of greater antiquity than the Hanoverian dynasty, infinitely greater than the royal line of Prussia, transcendently greater than the line of the Napoleons. Centuries before the printing press had quickened the intellectual pulse of Europe the Percys were not only great men, and allied with royalty by blood relationship, but makers and unmakers of kings. Before Columbus dreamt of a new world the Percys were a power and a great motive force in the old. At a time when England has just passed a Reform Bill, and when"], [453, "a.d. 1867.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 441 the high priests of democracy are burning incense to the mob as king, it is well to remember that a Percy was one of the barons who obtained from King John the great charter of our liberty, essentially the greatest Reform Bill England has ever seen, and which amid the shocks of armies, the dissolution of dynasties, and the vicissitudes of peoples, has survived intact for six hundred years. 1867 (May). \u2014 Died, at Barcelona, in Spain, on the 24th May, in his 39th year, Thomas William Charles, eldest son of Thomas Riddell, esq , of Felton Park and Swinburne Castle, Northumber land.

May 31. \u2014 An accident occurred, this evening, at Washington Coliiery, abc ut eight miles south of Newcastle, resulting in the death of eight men and two boys. It appeared that on being drawn to bank the brakesmen in charge of the engine did not stop the machinery as the cage got to the mouth of the pit. The result was that the cage, with its occupants, was drawn right up against the \"chocks,\" near the pullies, with so much violence that the wire rope broke, letting the cage and the men fall down the shaft. All the men must have been instantaneously killed, the pit being 250 yards in depth. Mr. William Armstrong, block-maker, Quayside, Newcastle, on cutting into a log of lignum vit\u00e6, found in the centre three acorns and two snail or whelk shells \u2014 from their hardness they were more like sea shells. There was no crack or flaw in the wood anywhere near the deposit. June 4. \u2014 The foundation-stone of the Prudhoe Memorial Con valescent Home was laid at Whitley. The ceremony was performed by Lord Warkworth, who last week reached his majority. The building is designed after the pavilion plan, which has prevailed in France and Germany for a number of years, and which Miss Nightingale and the Crimean Commissioners so strongly recommend. It consists of a central block, containing what is technically called the \" administration,\" or house department, with a central corridor running at right angles, out of which the various rooms project, both back and front, with open spaces between for ventilation and light. The front of the building will face the sea, and the whole of the apartments have a sea view. The length of the frontage is 230 feet, and the various offices extend to a depth of 190 feet backwards. The structure will be built entirely of stone, and the style of architecture adopted is gothic, of a simple and plain character, except the central portion, in which some architectual embellishment is displayed, in recognition of Algernon the Muni ficent, to whose memory the institution is erected as a memorial. The title of Prudhoe was borne by no one but Duke Algernon, and is now extinct. vol. in. i 2"], [454, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1867. 442 1867 (June 8) \u2014 A remarkable occurrence took place this morning in front of the portico, Central Station, Newcastle. Mr. Waugh, belonging to Sunderland, was crossing from the station to the opposite side ofthe street when the pole of a cab, which was being rapidly driven towards Collingwood-street, struck Mr. Waugh and laid him prostrate. The horses and vehicle passed over him, and, strange to say, on regaining his feet he discovered that he had not sustained the slightest injury. June 8. \u2014 The magnificent transport ship Jumna, built by Messrs. Palmer and Co., Jarrow, and which has, during the past few weeks, been fitting out in Shields harbour, left the Tyne this morning At about a quarter to seven o'clock, the Jumna, having hoisted the white ensign and the pendant, lest her moorings off the Stanhope and Tyne Drops, South Shields, and, in tow ot the tug steamers Robert Scott, Fiery Cross, Stephensons, and Tyne \u2014 the two former being ahead, and the latter on each side \u2014 proceeded down the harbour, her departure being witnessed by numbers of persons assembled at various points, and as she passed the manu factory of Tyzack, Whitely, and Co., Bell-street, North Shields, she was saluted with a volley of guns. Steam was up, but her machinery was not put into operation until at the entrance of the Narrows, when the screw was set in motion, and worked admir ably. She then proceeded to sea, crossing the bar at about a quarter-past seven o'clock. After getting to sea, her head was directed southward, and she cruised about sor some time. At nine o'clock she was observed off the bar, with her head to the north ward. She subsequently again commenced to cruise about, and afterwards did the measured mile of Whitley. She afterwards proceeded to Plymouth. At the time she lest Shields harbour she had on board several visitors, and she was attended down the river by the Harbour Master's and River Police boats. The sea pilot in charge of the Jumna was Mr. Michael Wheldon, of North Shields ; and after he left her she was taken charge of by Mr. Hindhaugh, of North Shields, North Sea pilot, who remained on board until her arrival at Plymouth. June 13. \u2014 Died, at the age of 82, Francis Mewburn, esq., who, for a period of upwards of half a century, conducted a highly-successful and extensive practice as a solicitor in Darlington, and no man probably enjoyed the confidence of his clients in a more eminent degree, in consequence of his unremittiug attention to their interests, his sterling and unflinching integrity, and the wisdom of his advice. Not only were his individual cliints more numerous than those of anv other solicitor in the county of Durham, but the appointments held by him as solicitor to public and corporate bodies were more varied than usually fall to the lot of one profes sional man. He was the solicitor to the first passenger railway ever constructed, namely, the Stockton and Darlington, from whence sprung that amazing system of network which now encircles the globe, and to the time of his retirement from the profession in 1860 he continued to be solicitor to that railway and its numerous"], [455, "a.d. 1867.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 443 branches. In his early efforts in connection with that railway he was closely associated with Edward Pease and George Stephenson, the former of whom provided the funds, and the latter the skill, which so throughly revolutionised our system of travelling, and placed these three celebrities at the head of the railway world. Mr. Mewburn also held for a great many years the office of Chief Bailiff of Darlington, and on all public occasions presided as the chief officer of that town. That ancient office will now be abolished, its duties having, to some extent, become obsolete. He was a man of rare intellectual attainments; and his knowledge and researches, as an antiquary, were very considerable ; and to the pages of many of the works and periodicals devoted to that peculiar study, he has been a frequent and welcome contributor. As a member of the Church of England he was thoroughly devoted to it, and by private correspondence and public effort, laboured with some success to promote its interests, and enjoyed the friendship of several of the clergy and bishops of the diocese of Durham. 1867 (June25). \u2014 This was the opening day ofthe Newcastle Race Meeting. The Northumberland Plate was won by M. Montgomery's b c Fervacques (Butler), beating Moldavia, Fairwind, and five others. The Cup was won by Mr. J. Osborne's br f Romping Girl (Challoner), beating Strathconan, Plover, and nine others. June 30. \u2014 A fatal accident occurred this evening near Shotton Edge. Mr. J. W. Scurr and Mr. Richard Reay, sen., farmers, of Berwick Hill, near Ponteland, drove down to Bed- lington in a dog cart, to visit a late invalid neighbour. On their return home, they had nearly arrived at the entrance of the lane leading to Brenkley, when the young horse Mr. Reay was driving, a very spirited one, was startled by something coming out of the hedge, which caused it to spring to the opposite side of the road. The wheel of the vehicle came in contact with the edging stones of the footpath, and Mr. Scurr was immediately pitched over Mr. Reay, both falling violently on the road on theii heads Mr. Reay was stunned lor some time, and aster gaining consciousness found his friend quite dead. Mr. Scurr, who was a young man, was the son of the Rev. Jonathan Scurr, incutiibent of Ninebanks, near Haydon Bridge, and bad occupied the Field House Farm, at Berwick Hill, for little more than two years. July 4. \u2014 The marriage of Mr. Charles M. Palmer, of Grinkle Park, Yorkshire, and Newcastle-upon Tyne, and Miss Augusta Mary Lambert, only daughter of Chevalier Alfred Lambert, was solemnized at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, London. The marriage ceremony was performed by the Rev. A. L. Lambert, uncle of the bride, assisted by the Rev. C. Moody, Vicar of Newcastle. The bride wore a magnificent dress of white satin, trimmed with Brussels lace, and was attended by ten brides maids. July 10 \u2014 This morning a melancholy case of drowning occurred at Whitley. Mr. Samuel Cooper, draper and under taker, of Newcastle, had been stopping at that watering place with"], [456, "HISTORICAL REGISTER OF fA.D. 1867. 444 his wife and family, and, having gone down to the beach to bathe, the spot at which he entered was tolerably shallow, but he suddenly plunged into deep water, and before effectual aid could be obtained Mr. Cooper was drowned. The deceased was highly respected by a large circle of friends and acquaintances. 1867 (July \\1) \u2014 A most extraordinary and shocking accident happened at Darlington, to-day, immediately after the arrival of the six o'clock Government train from London. Mr. Thomas Vaughan, of Gunnergate, near Middlesbro' had purchased, in London, three splendid young horses, and they were sent by train to Dar lington, en route to Gunnergate, in charge of an experienced groom. So particular was Mr. Vaughan that every care should be taken of the horses on their arrival, that he sent instructions for three other men to be in attendance at the stations to meet them. The horses were to be led, but one of the grooms, named J. M. Johnson, a young man about twenty-five years of age, persisted in mounting that in his charge, although unprovided with proper bit and bridle, and he had no sooner done so than it took fright, galloped at the top of its speed from the station, and leaped the wall of what is known as the Railway Cut, and fell to the hard turnpike below, a depth of about 35 feet. The horse was killed on the spot, and the unfortunate rider so terribly smashed that there was but tbe faintest hope of his surviving. His thigh was broken, his head terribly cut, and jaw fractured. He was at once conveyed to the Cottage Hospital, and received every attention his case required. The horse had been purchased a few days before for 100 guineas. July 20. \u2014 Died, at Belsay Castle, aged 88, Sir Charles Miles Lambert Monck, bart. The deceased was an ardent sportsman and had for many years kept up a splendid stud of racers. Though not the most successful on the turf, he bred a few whose performances have made them celebrated. Sir Charles was about the best specimen of the \" old English gontleman.\" For some years past the deceased baronet had led a very retired life, and only a week before his death expressed to a member of his house hold a wish that his funeral might be a private one. The wish was strictly complied with. On the 27th his mortal remains were interred at the unobtrusive village of Bolam, about three miles distant from Belsay. July 28. \u2014 This afternoon a melancholy catastrophe occurred at the mouth of the Tyne. It appeared that three seamen \u2014 Thomas Laird, of Dublin, John Keating, of Colchester, and Charles Poleman, a Prussian \u2014 had been carousing in North Shields with Jesse Stewart, Elizabeth Clark, and Mary Ann Fitzgerald, unfortunate women, and that, accompanied by Robert Higgins, a fiddler they had engaged a boat, belonging to Thomas Wilson, who also accompanied them, and in it they proceeded down the river to the estuary of the Tyne. As a result of a north-eastern gale the sea was rough, but the boat's crew of reck less persons proceeded direct amongst the breakers. The result was that upon turning their boat's bow to the sea, one tremendous"], [457, "a.d. 1867. J 445 REMARKABLE EVENTS. wave overlapped it, and scattered the company in all directions, whose struggles in the water were painfully visible to crowds of people on the south pier. The boat being upset Wilson and Poleman clung to the bottom until taken off by some pilots ; the other six were drowned. 1867 (August 7).\u2014 This evening John Todd, an engineman on board the steam tug Ann and Jane, came to his death in a most horrible manner. He had gone on board his boat in a state of intoxication, and proceeded as usual to the engine-house, the doors of which were open. The boat shortly afterwards put off to a foreign vessel, and, when at its fastest rate of motion, a young man saw deceased fall into the engine-house amongst the machinery. The engine was immediately stopped, and after great difficulty the body was extricated, when it was found to be literally crushed to pieces, having been dragged by the crank of the engine through an aperture five inches in circumference. August 8.\u2014 A large number of ladies and gentlemen assembled on the green in front of the Riding School, Bath. road, Newcastle, on the occasion of presenting Lieut-Col. BeU with a gold medal, on his retiring from the command of the Northumberland and Newcastle Yeomanry Cavalary. The gallant colonel served about 50 years in the corps, and his brother soldiers would not allow him to leave them without presenting him with some token of their esteem and admiration of the manner in which he had discharged the important duties of his office as commander. The members of the regiment accordingly mustered in strong force at the place appointed for the presentation, to give their former commanding officer a hearty farewell, and to present him with a humble testimonial \u2014 a gold medal. On the medal was inscribed as follows : \u2014 \" Presented to Lieut-Col. Bell by the quarter-masters, staff, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the Northumberland and Newcastle Yeo manry Cavalry, as a mark of respect and regard on his resigning the command of the regiment after 50 years' service. 1867.\" Quarter-Master Balmbra made the presentation. In doing so, he alluded to the establishment ofthe regiment in 1819, and to the occasions on which it had been called out to assist the civil power in repressing disturbances. He next spoke ofthe early connection with the regiment of Lieut-Col. Bell, and to his being called to the command in 1826. He mentioned the difficulties Lieut-Col. Bell had to encounter in the formation of the regiment, and the able assistance he derived from his amiable lady, Mrs. BeU. The character and abilities of the late commander where dwelt upon at considerable length by the speaker, and spoke of in very high and eulogistic terms. They might be thankful, however, that in losing their valued commander, he was followed by Sir M. W. Ridley, a distingnished officer, who would by his exertions endeavour to heighten the reputation of the corps. Colonel Bell than addressed the assembly, and expressed his utter want of language to convey to them his feelings sor the honour they had done him in decorating him with such a handsome medal \u2014 a medal that would be preserved"], [458, "446 HISTORICAL REGISTER OF [a.D. 1867. as long as he lived, and when he died it would be an heirloom to those that came after him. He then returned his most heartfelt thanks for their kindness. 1867 (August 11/\u2014 This afternoon a fearful conflagration took place in Newcastle, when one of the most magnificent ranges of houses and shops were all but destroyed, and damage done to the estimated amount of \u00a370,000. The property destroyed formed that part of the Central Exchange Buildings which stretched from the entrance to the News Room in Grey-street, to some distance past the entrance in Market-street. This magnificent block of buildings formed a triangle, the fronts being in Grey-street, Market-street, and Grainger-street, the centre being occupied by the Exchange News Room, known to commercial men in all parts of the world, and the finest room of the kind to be sound anywhere, and has, since its completion been looked upon as one of the institutions of Newcastle, one of the sights which it was not for strangers on coming to the town to neglect to visit. The principal sufferers by the fire were \u2014 Messrs. Horn and Storey, music warehouse ; Messrs. G- Angus and Co., gutta percha warehouse ; Mr. G. Rideout, Central Exchange Hotel ; Mr. John Bradbum, dyer ; Messrs. Wood and Co , wine merchants ; Mr. J. Smith, draper, &c. ; Mr. J. Pattinson, perfumer. August 21. \u2014 Died, at Alnwick Castle, aged 89, the Most High and Puissant and Most Noble Prince George Percy, Duke and Earl of Northumberland, Earl Percy, Earl of Beverley, in the county of York, Baron Warkworth, of Warkworth Castle, and Lord Lovaine, Baron of Alnwick, Baronet, and one of the Lords of Her Majesty's most honourable council. The body lay in state at Alnwick Castle a few days previous to its removal to Westminster Abbey, where it was interred on the 30th, with all the honours befitting his exalted rank. The bells of Newcastle, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick, Tynemouth, Shields, &c, tolled muffled peals from twelve till two, and other marks of respect were observed in the north. A hatchment, containing the heraldic insignia of the late duke, was placed in front of the Barbican of Alnwick Castle, but its emblazonment appears shorn of the honouis bome by previous dukes of Northumberland. It displays the arms of Brabant, Lucy, and Percy, quartered per pale with those of the Stewart, Wortley, Mackenzies, Earls of Wharncliffe, of which family the consort of the late duke was a member, but those of Poynings, Fitzpayne, Bryan, and Latimer are missing. There were six baronies inherited from Josceline, the eleventh earl of Northumberland, by Elizabeth, the first duchess, namely, those of Percy, Lucy, Poynings, Fitzpayne, Bryan, and Latimer, and these she transmitted to her eldest son and his heirs general. The third and fourth dukes having died without leaving direct heirs, these baronies would seem, by the usual law which regulates the descent of such tenures, to pertain now to the issue of their sister, the Lady Glenlyon, daughter of the second duke, whose grandson and direct representative is the present Duke of Athol, to whom, there fore, they would appear to belong."], [459, "A.D. 1867.] REMARKABLE EVENTS. 447 1867 (September 15/\u2014 This forenoon, in Church-street United Piesbyterian Church, Berwick-on-Tweed, the Rev. Jas. Porteous baptized the child of Mr. John Young, Castle-terrace. This circumstance is worthy of notice in consequence of the reverend gentleman having baptized not only the mother of the child but her mother also, the wife of the Rev. Mr. Muirhead, Wooler, and what adds to the interest of the incident is the additional fact that Mr. Porteous performed the marriage ceremony of the maternal great grandfather and mother of the child in 1816, and of its grandfather and mother, and assisted also at the marriage of the child's parents September 23 \u2014 This evening the New Tyne Theatre and Opera House, situate in Westgate, Newcastle, was opened with the most brilliant success, an immense audience crowding the spacious interior from floor to ceiling. The house, indeed, presented a most magnificent appearance. The grand sunlight in the centre of the ceiling cast a flood of softened brightness into every nook and corner of the building. The delicate lace-like pattern covering the front of the dress circle, upper circle, and gaUery, the bright scarlet coverings of the seats in the lower tier of boxes, the crimson hue of the walls behind, the soft blue tint of the gallery walls, ceiling, and interior of the private boxes were seen in all their beauty end freshness, and the effect was unanimously pronounced to be one of unrivalled gaiety and magnificence. Mr. George Stanley, the lessee and manager, in his inaugural address, said, \" Of the work of the architect, Mr. Parnell, I need not speak, the theatre itself is the best recommendation to his professional ability and skill. To the enterprising contractors for the building, Messrs. J. and W. Lowery and Walter Scott, I am under deep obligations, not only for the substantial and workmanlike manner in which they have fulfilled their contract, but also for the energy and earnestness with which they have exerted themselves to enable me to keep faith with the public. My best thanks are also due to the other tradesmen engaged in the erection of the building, Messrs. John Abbot and Co , Gateshead ; Messrs. Richardson, and Co , painters and decorators, St, Nicholas' Churchyard ; Mr. Moor, cabinet maker ; Mr Preston, slater ; Messrs W. H.

Mr. Cummins served his time at Messrs. Stephenson's factory, and for several years held the situation of foreman. On leaving that establishment a spontaneous exhibition of kindly feelings was manifested by young and old, and two valnabe testimonials were presented to him : one, a silver snuff box, by about sixty of the apprentices ; the other was subscribed for by the workmen atd other personal friends, and consisted of a magnificent gold watch and chain, from the establishment of Mr. Thomas Gregson, Collingwood-street, and was valued at between \u00a340 and \u00a350. The presentation took place at the Blenheim House Hotel, Marlborough-Street. The watch hore the foUowing inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to John Cummins by the foreman and workmen of Messrs. R.
